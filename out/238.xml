    You've gotta hand it to the Coen brothers, they sure know how to inject style and flamboyance in their creations. And to think that "Raising Arizona" was only their second feature film makes the accomplishment even more impressive although "Blood Simple." was powerful enough an announcement of two upcoming talents threatening to shake Hollywood's conventions with a unique sense of eccentricity, and human depth. "Blood Simple." was still borrowing some elements from film-noir and Hitchcock movies, and, no matter how effective it was, it could have easily been targeted as an exercise in style. This is why the Coen brothers couldn't have made a better choice by making a zany comedy with a tender and more optimistic tone. And not only the film works but "Raising Arizona" is now a comedy classic, so special that it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath than 80's comedies for the simple reason that it differs from what was made in that decade. And that's the thing about the Coen brothers, they make timeless films, set in universes, playing like crossroads between fantasy and reality, where their stories float with a bizarre but so penetrating poetry. I know this is a Coen brothers' so we're tempted to get deeper on the subject. Granted it's not just a story about two people who kidnap a baby because they can't have one, there are far more symbolism and philosophical material lying underneath the screwball carapace, but how about enjoying the film for what it is: one hilarious piece of cinematic greatness carried by the kind of colorful cast that made the Coen's films so lively. And what a cast! Nicolas Cage is H.I. aka "Hi" McDunnough, a multiple recidivist specialized in robbing market stores and Holly Hunter is Edwina aka 'Ed', the photographer who took so many mug shots she ended up proving that indeed, opposites attracted. But the Coen brothers are not the type of directors to comfortably sit on the presence of two solid protagonist, they know supporting characters are the spices that give the film its flavor. So, we have the two escaped prison buddies, two brothers played by two Johns, John Goodman, who'd become one of the Coen's greatest asset with such a physical presence he'd steal the show anytime, anywhere and Forsythe as his dim-witted brother. There is Sam McMumurray as Glen, the bourgeois pain-in-the-ass and the late Trey Wilson as Nathan Arizona, father of cute blonde-haired quints, the furniture magnate whose motto consist on concluding all his statements with "or my name isn't Nathan Arizona". Each character illuminates the screen with a unique presence, even little Nathan Jr. makes you believe people would kill each other to get him, and Frances McDormand is given a less important play but plays it with the required over-the-top way you'd expect from the woman who chose a guy like Glen for husband. Speaking of Glen, nothing against Sam McMurray but I would have loved to see John Turturro playing his part, if only because it would have made "Raising Arizona"'s the consummate Coen brothers' film, with characters before stories. Hell, it goes even to the point where the most seemingly inoffensive market-cashier can tot a gunshot and become a Dirty Harry-like figure, no one is to be underestimated, not when laughs are at stakes. Naturally, such story deserves a worthy villain and this is where Randal 'Tex' Cobb makes his entrances, as a man coming from nowhere, supposedly incarnating the devil, whenever he goes, grass never grow back and this modern Atilla of biker of the apocalypse first emerges in HI's dream after he stole Nathan's kid. He symbolizes HI's conscience, something that will torment him until he finds the way to redeem himself, and this is the philosophical stuff hidden beneath the film, it's about characters doing morally wrong things, and finding their own path to redemption. When a recidivist teams up with a cop and both stole parents' fruits of love, you know this ain't the way to reach marital happiness. And the whole narrative is cooked up up in typical Mid-West accent, flirting with caricature but giving "Raising Arizona"its colorful spirit, the same as "Fargo" with its overuse of Scandinavian accent made of "Yah" and "You betcha". This is the Coens' signature and it doesn't limit to dialogs but goes to the soundtrack and from the title to the score, you have the hillbilly thing screaming all over the place. Till today, it's impossible not to hear "Raising Arizona" without having that fast-paced upbeat banjo music and catchy yodel that makes you want to escape from whatever makes your routine. You got it, "Raising Arizona" is pure entertaining escapism, with a man and a woman giving their life a meaning the wrong way, before learning the lessons, the hard way. And what a lesson! the conclusion of the film is probably the most insightful and beautiful thing ever put in a film, transcending the limits of comedies to something that cuts straight to your heart. And by the way, I couldn't believe Roger Ebert's review, my only guess he didn't have enough perspective and he probably changed his mind after. But thanks to Ebert, I learned the definition of a good movie, from Howard Hawks' quote. It's made of three good scenes and no bad scenes. There are none in "Raising Arizona" and there are three mesmerizing sequences: one of the most promising and funny introductions ever, then the market scene that reinvents the foot-chase forever, and made it deeply intertwined with hillbilly yodel like banjo music did for "Bonnie and Clyde", and ten you have one of the most poignant and meaningful monologues ever. There are three great moments in "Raising Arizona", in the beginning, the middle and the ending, and if only for these moments, with so many laughs in-between, "Raising Arizona" is one of the greatest comedies ever  or my IMDb user name isn't ElMaruecan82.

    The Coen Brothers have made many great films and worked in many different genres. One of their most famous comedies is Raising Arizona, a fast paced, zany comedy that can only come from the minds of the Coens. H.I. "Hi" McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) is a career criminal who falls for policewoman Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter) and goes straight for her. After they get married they attempt to have a child, but when Ed finds out she is infertile and the pair unable to adopt the couple take the logically route of kidnapping a baby from a wealthy couple who have just had quintuplets. But their actions get complicated by two escaped convicted, a police investigation and a ruthless bounty hunter. Raising Arizona is a very funny comedy that zips along at a great pace. The Coens' fingerprints are all over this film, having a sharply written script and excellent direction throughout. The jokes are constant throughout the film, giving us a variety of style of humour, from great one-liners, character interactions and pure physical comedy. The Coens bring a lot of energy to the film as we get over the top set pieces like the robbery where Ed abandons Hi and the Coens being a brings a kinetic style with their camera movements and editing of set pieces. We get a great prologue at the beginning of the film as we find out about Hi and Ed's past and how they came to their solution with funny jokes on the way. As well as the direction, Raising Arizona is blessed with a top cast who give both comic and sincere performances. Cage and Hunter had great chemistry together, having excellent comic time and were committed to their roles. Cage worked well with his supporting cast as they assemble a top cast: John Goodman being a particular highlight as one of the escaped prisoners. The Coens Brothers' direction is frantic through the film, using fast paced editing, hand-held cameras and tracking shots, amplifying the comedy, showing this maniac universe and gives Raising Arizona a distinctive visual style. The Coen's regular composer Carter Burwell also supplies a great score for the film, particular the use of a country/folk like guitar score which was a perfect fit for the film. Raising Arizona is a very entertaining, funny and heartfelt comedy that can stand along some of the best works the Coen Brothers have had to offer. It is a screwball comedy that can cater to many tests from intelligent jokes, observations and character interactions, to more over the top physical and visual comedy.

    Honestly, I did not expect even the first Cohen brothers films to be really good. This one definitely is worth watching because the seriousness with which Cohen brothers make frivolous movies is best and this time. Busy throughout the film to make the foreground absurd or to the characters or to the situations in which they fall in, the two filmmakers get us into the world of attracting of opposites. Line from the movie, which can serve as an example here would be: "If a frog had wings, it would hardly hitting the legs into the body when jumping." In equally absurd way arises the love between a young policewoman and obsessive in robberies of shops criminal (collection of fools, as they point themselves). As she turns frigid, they decide to steal a child from a newly born five twins. And thus began the mess that does not stop until the end. The film is ideal for detente and kicking a bad mood and driving a good one.

    Raising Arizona is easily one of the funniest,greatest and most original Comedies of all time and a timeless film classic. Filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a wonderful screenplay,truly beautiful cinematography and an unforgettable score,Raising Arizona is The Coen Brothers at their best and greatest. Raising Arizona tells the story of H.I. McDunnough(Nicholas Cage),a criminal and repeat offender and police officer 'Ed' Edwina(Holly Hunter)who fall in love and after falling in love decide to get married and have kids. When H.I. and Ed can't conceive kids of their own,H.I and Ed kidnap a quintuplet,Nathan Arizona JR(T.J Kuhn JR) one of the children of local business man Nathan Arizona(Trey Wilson). When H.I and Ed take Nathan J.r and want to raise him as their own wild and hilarious things happen in their lives. Raising Arizona is one of the all-time great classic Comedies from The Coen Brothers that came after their amazing film debut Blood Simple. When filmmakers have a first film that is so acclaimed and well loved, most filmmakers have to do a second film that lives up to the quality of their first film and not only does Raising Arizona live up to Blood Simple but also gives viewers and brilliant and much lighter cinematic experience. One of the reasons Raising Arizona is excellent and truly hilarious is because The Coen Brothers have given us a flawless film that combines great laughs with style and substance where everything in the film is over the top and exaggerated to the point of going over the top beyond belief. The laughs and humor in the film are funny,ingenious and original with hilarious Slapstick Comedy,funny dialog and moments in the movie that have you laughing until your stomach hurts and will have tears running down your face. The laughs are so crazy and over the top you will you're watching a surreal live Action Cartoon. What is also great about the Humor in this film and other Coen Brother films is that the laughs are subtle and used in visuals and imagery that are not obvious the first time you watch RA but when you watch the film with multiple viewings you will notice or catch some of the visual jokes of the film. And speaking of of visuals RA is one of the most beautiful and visually stunning Comedies I have ever seen. Barry Sonnefield's photography is amazing and powerful with wide angle shots,close ups and shots of the sunlight,road and dusty world of Arizona. Sonnefield's photography gives the film a surreal and wild energy that you don't see in most comedies and that is one of the great things that set RZ apart from other films of it's type because RA can have wonderful style but also a great substance. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is hilarious and well and one of the best screenplays in Comedy history with the Coens giving the main great dialog that is funny,memorable and stylized as well as greatly using narration for H.I. McDunnough and lines from the main characters that are quotable and will stay in your mind. The two main characters H.I. and Ed McDunnough while over the top and are cartoon characters who are funny but are given great depth and humanity and you feel like the two truly love and care for one another and even though H.I and Ed kidnapped a baby they don't do for fame or money,they do it because they want to be parents and want to love a child and the kidnapping make the main characters more complex than they truly are and that is one of things that great about RA and the Coens. Although not an Action film RA has a couple of good Action and chase scenes that are thrilling and exciting. Especially the film's main chase scene which is one of the funniest,wildest,original and over the top chase scenes in film history and it is a classic chase that that you will never forget. The ending of the film is funny,beautiful and very optimistic and will make you wonder what will happen to H.I and ED. An great ending to a great film. The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Nicholas Cage is brilliant,funny and at his best as H.I McDunnough,with Cage bringing laughs and depth to the role. Holly Hunter is excellent as 'Ed' Edwina McDunnough,with Hunter feisty and funny and having great chemistry with Cage. Trey Wilson is wonderful and fun as Nathan Arizona,a local business man. John Goodman and William Forsythe are great,funny and over the top as Gale and Evelle Snoats,escaped convicts who are H.I's friends. Sam McMurray and Francis McDormand are amazing and hilarious as husband and wife Glen and Dot,friends of H.I. and Ed. Randell 'Tex' Cobb is fantastic as Leonard Smalls,a man hunter who's a man of few words and is looking for Nathan JR. The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is excellent,with The Coens always moving the camera,using wide angles,low angles,close-ups and giving the film a great visual style. Great direction by The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is is amazing,funny,beautiful and very quirky and matches the tone of the film,with Burwell greatly mixing whistles,yodeling,organs and banjos. Wonderful score by Burwell. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you check out Raising Arizona,a truly hilarious,funny and unforgettable Comedy and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I adore this one. I'll have you know it is my 'feelgood' movie, having seen it now a dozen times it never fails to lift my spirits. After some deliberation, I am finally putting it on my list of must see films. What the Coens have done here is a very delicate thing. The obvious first. What you see in the film is both 'real', a loving trailer trash couple cannot conceive a child, and sleepless bending of reality as the urge to steal one so they can finally have a 'full family unit' manifests around them in all sorts of crazy situations. The biker from Hell is the tip of the thread, first dreamed about and in a weird confluence of forces soon appears in reality as dreamed. From that point on, everything is askew while pointing to anxious dreaming. Prison pals from HI's criminal past show up in the middle of the night. The frantic hunt for Huggies, starting with another botched holdup. HI's boss as the dreary dead-end of family life. More obvious, the business with the hole in the ground. It isn't simply surreal, a term normally associated with vaguely weird stream-of-consciousness. It's film noir, the film is sandwiched after all between the much more openly noirish Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. The Coens get noir, where the desire for life to be other/better than it is (not for sex or money as in noir, but blissful family life here personified in the baby) causes peculiar whims in perception, and those whims mysteriously manifest in the narrator's 'choosing' of the reality he remembers, collapsing in the process. Noir is magical, alluring to this day, because all those things are causally inextricable, desire from dream or memory from mysterious happenings in the story, which is why we often collapse the whole knotted mess to the workings of some celestial fate. There's all sorts of stuff woven on top. Reagan's morning in America as neurotic hyper-normalcy, the bum HI as the flipside of that, laid-back and tied to the American tradition of glorified frontiersmen and criminals, lampooned in the biker. 1980's suburbia as consumerist limbo. It's a helluva ride. Next to Blue Velvet and Society, the definitive 1980's film. It does all sort of collapse together by the end, which supports and enhances the idea of the random , whimsical arising of dreams. Big Lebowski starts here. Its charm? You can 'get' this without 'getting' it. The whole Huggies sequence is as profound to me as any cinematic dream. But it isn't like Tarkovksy who bypasses the mind by long mystifying sweeps, hitting deep in this way. It strikes an amazing balance between self-conscious intelligent conception and the bypass in spontaneous asides of fun and tremendous heartHI and Ed (the lovely Holly Hunter) are one of the most loving couples in filmdom. Intelligence, fun and emotion, these three are inextricable. This being so, you can 'get' the film via any route. It ends with an Ozzie and Harriet movie dream of the perfect life.

    Criminal Herbert I. "Hi" (Nicolas Cage) after his continued visits to a prison happens to marry Edwina "Ed" after his latest release from prison. Soon the couple discovers that Ed is not fit to be a mother and are unable to adopt a baby due to Ed's Criminal record. So they decide to kidnap one of the Quints of a local furniture magnate "Nathan Arizona" believing it to be Nathan Jr. Problems arouse as Hi is visited by his prison buddies and he thinks of returning to his notorious lifestyle along with his supervisor discovering that kid is not his after he made an unsuccessful wife swapping offer to him. Matters get worse as a bounty hunter named Leo Smalls gets in search of Nathan Jr. to sell him in the market and Hi's buddies taking undue advantage of junior's identity. Do watch this early Coen Bros. movie because of some great comic scenes especially the scene where Hi steals a pack of diapers and it is one of those movies that gives us the insight into the kind of characters the duo generates, dialogues they write and unconventional music score that became symbolic for their future movies. MY RATING: 9/10

    The film Raising Arizona begins with the unfortunate life of H.I. McDunnough (Nicholas Cage) and his journeys in and out of prison where he meets his future wife, Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter), a corrections officer. The two get married and discover that they cannot have children of their own, despite their beliefs that they are good people and would make great parents. Around that time, Nathan and Florence Arizona (Trey Wilson and Lynne Kitei) give birth to quintuplets, and discover that so many children are "more than they can handle!" The McDunnoughs, with their good intentions in hand, kidnap one of the quintuplets to raise as their own, believing that they are doing the Arizona's a favor. The primary theme of this film is the effects of karma, or the idea that "what goes around comes around." This theme can be found throughout the film, as characters like Gale and Evelle Snoats (John Goodman and William Forsythe) fail in their attempt to rob a bank and eventually return to jail. The theme can also be found through the consequences that the McDunnoughs face as a result of the kidnapping, and the reactions of Nathan Arizona when he finally learns what has happened to his son. The primary tool used to explain the theme of the film is the voice-over. A voice-over can be used to fill in gaps and make a film cohesive, or to explain background or contextual information to the viewer (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). In Raising Arizona, the voice-over is used for both reasons, and gives thorough insights into the thoughts and motives of the characters. This tool is very effective in conveying the theme of the film in that sense. The acting throughout the film is also very effective in helping to convey the theme of the film. H.I. is a very innocent character, despite his many crimes, and the acting portrays this well. Ed is another na&iuml;ve character, who does not fully understand the consequences of her actions. As both of these characters begin to realize the consequences of their actions, they begin to take responsibility for them and try to do what is best for everyone. In that sense, both actors help to contribute to the theme of the film by effectively displaying the emotions and motivations of their characters. The theme of this film is similar to the themes of many other films, like, for example, the film Elf, where the primary character, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell), acts on his good intentions, even when his actions may not be the right thing to do. For example, in one scene, Buddy gets in a fight with a store "Santa" (Artie Lange) because Buddy knows that the man is an imposter. The message of this film is very important to everyone, because good intentions are very important, but it is still important that one always tries to do what is right. Though they may have started off on the wrong path, Ed and H.I. finally make amends and do what is right for everyone involved in the situation. References Boggs, J. M. & Petrie, D. W. (2008).

    Raising Arizona is a film that follows the story of an unconventional couple; convict Hi (Cage) and police officer Ed (Hunter), as they attempt to find harmony and happiness in their lives together. However, their greatest obstacle is Ed's sterility that slowly wears on their relationship and threatens their sanity until opportunity arises in the form of a wealthy local whose wife births "more than she can handle". Accomplishing the abduction proves a bit difficult, but the rabid persistence of Ed drives their mission to success, and with the addition of this vital piece, it seems a true family is born. Unfortunately, prying and obnoxious colleagues, mischievous jailbirds/buddies, and a gritty detective with a Harley threaten their happiness, but also demonstrate how misguided and selfish their actions have been. Returning the baby to an appreciative and surprisingly sympathetic father, Hi reflects on the affection we have for children, even if they're not our own and is able to sleep peacefully with dreams for the future that he hopes holds a family of his very own. I generally appreciate the Coen Brother's films and what I appreciate most is their ability to hold interest of the audience through plot twists and strong characters; there's nothing extreme or very showy about their work and yet it stands out because there is only ever and illusion of normalcy and sanity in their characters or the plot, really the work is quite complex but we appreciate it more because they make no pretense. Raising Arizona continues this tradition and also has quite a flavor of Americana, enhanced greatly by the colorful characters. The humor was ludicrous most times, but it was balanced through the sensitive and reflective nature of the protagonist, whose broodings lend itself to the underlying sense of loneliness and hopelessness of the characters and the landscape and drive the rich plot forward. I feel that any criticism would simply be void for two reasons: I believe that this film is very stylistic and I don't believe that they ventured out of this particular structure, any risk they took (including the dream sequences) had basis in reality and only served to give the film more poetic flavor, and secondly, I believe that the film was unique and heartfelt among it's genre, which at times is difficult to achieve in something externally so seemingly detached as comedy, and mainly, I think there was valid reasoning behind it's creation, which is my only objection with modern film. The cinematography of the film was very interesting and was able to keep the audience occupied by the sheer amount of stimulation the wild camera movements brought. I was able to appreciate the shaky camera work simply because I think it does justice to Hi's convict past as well as his current lifestyle, punctuated by his most daring criminal offense yet. This apparently dramatic and brutal world is something that few of us can sympathize with and I think the long takes through several different environments contributes to that foreign aspect of the film that quite frankly makes it hilarious. Motifs in the film include the joined hands of Hi and Ed, representing their bond and their support of each other, the fire that erupts from the detective, representing his nature, and the convenient store that represents Hi's temptation or the pull of his old life. The brothers use this as well as a few non-diegetic inserts (including baby toys) to bring a bit of understanding to the rapidly moving plot, but it is interesting to note that this veers a bit from the slapstick genre that is quite shallow and brings a poetic aspect to the film. In the abduction scene the use of high-angle and low-angle shots capture flawlessly both the perspective of Hi and of the babies and the power shift that takes place between them, succeeding in making Hi seem vulnerable among these small creatures. Also, throughout the entire film the use of the wide-angle lens is used, making people and surroundings seem distorted and often a bit out of proportion. The abduction scene demonstrates the use of this very well, especially when the babies are taking a very long time to reach the door and then the end of the hallway, giving Hi enough time to catch them before Mrs. Arizona discovers. This also contributes to the suspense of the scene, because everything seems to take longer to happen and Hi is running out of time to act. Off-screen action and voice is used quite a bit to stage a change in events in the plot and repetition of certain events forming a montage is comedic as well as clarity inducing. It really strikes both emotional stances quite well and makes for a heartfelt and poetic take on the slapstick comedy genre, aided by the strong narrative voice that guides us through a ridiculous and tragic journey of an unlikely couple trying to find the missing piece in their family.

    A quick checklist for anyone considering this movie: 1. Coenheads - if you are one, proceed to checkout 2. Hollow humorist - if you like to be force fed your humor, you're in luck. 3. Bicoastalism - plenty of middle/Southern/Western stereotypes here 4. Amateur Auteurs - Watch this film so you can earn your "I'm-more- sophisticated-than-you" pin. All others should bypass this cinematic desert. It has been said that much art is devised to impress other artists. I think that attitude is central to Coeney Island, and this film certainly falls into the category euphemistically called "quirky". Products such as this can't be blamed for aiming squarely at their intended audience. If you like this kind of pseudo-intellectual fare, bully for you. There are plenty of vendors for this kind of ware. All others who will try to find anything substantial will be sorely disappointed. You won't experience wildness, depth, sentiment, wonder, fury, intrigue, edginess, insight, lasciviousness, or even a good joke. In fact, what's really missing is honesty. You will be served up mounds of pretense and self-important contrivance, infused with long-expired sophomorism, and powdered with clip art humanism. Package above with ,uh, quirky dialogue (hard to assign that term since the characters don't express anything to each other or the audience) and you have all the haughty form-over-substance. cookie-cutter originality that the anesthetized soul craves. It was finely-crafted bubble-wrap, I admit that.

    Raising Arizona is a not-so-funny comedy surrounding the marriage and infertility of ex-cop, Ed McDonnough (Holly Hunter) and her ex-con husband, H.I. (Nicolas Cage). When the couple is told by her doctor that they would not be able to conceive a child of their own, Ed is devastated. While watching television one evening, the couple sees that Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), a rich, furniture store owner and his wife were now the proud parents of quintuplets. Ed concocts a plan to "borrow" one of their babies because she believes they "have their hands full" with 5 babies. This in turn sets off a crazy string of events which leave the couple in a fight for their "borrowed" child, their freedom and their love for one another. The theme of Raising Arizona is a character's struggle within themselves to soothe the constant "wants" in life that are not necessarily needed. Throughout the movie, Ed just wants to be happy. Before marrying H.I., she just wanted to meet the right man and get married. During one scene when Ed is booking H.I. into one of his many jail stints, she is sobbing because her then fianc&eacute;' had broken up with her. This was the first time that Ed realized that she had feelings for H.I., when he showed compassion for her and told her that her fianc&eacute;' had to be stupid to leave her. Soon after, Ed and H.I. were married and she immediately wanted to start having babies. This proved to be impossible for them and her desperate "want" to be a mother caused her to grow depressed, lose interest in everything - including cleaning her house and she lost her job. H.I. just seems to be along for the crazy ride. The wild story line and almost unfathomable shenanigans in this movie are somewhat similar to the 1990 Dennis Dugan movie, Problem Child, starring John Ritter. In both movies, there are couples who desperately want to have a child and when they are both given what they want it proves to be much more than they can handle. Both movies are filled with conflict and chaos right up to the very end. The motifs and camera angles brought out the theme of this movie and made it more exciting to watch. Throughout the movie the viewer is constantly reminded that Ed wants a baby and after Baby Arizona is "borrowed", the camera is fixated on how Ed and H.I. plan to keep him and keep their secret. The camera techniques were great in this movie. There were several parallel cuts that took the viewer back and forth between two different locations as the suspense was rising. In one particular scene, Ed, H.I. and Baby Jr. are driving home from spending a day with friends and they pull into a store to pick up some diapers. H.I. is tempted to resort to his old ways and ends up robbing the store. Ed sees him through the window and immediately becomes angry and drives away, leaving him to fend for himself. What H.I. doesn't anticipate though, is the store clerk is ready for him. After pushing an emergency button to alert the authorities, the clerk pulls out a rifle and starts shooting at H.I. Just as he is running away the cops pull up and start a wild chase. The cameras cut back and forth between H.I. running through streets, yards and houses, the cops chasing him and Ed, who had a change of heart about leaving him and decides to go back and try to help save him from the police. All of the chaos and goofy humor combined with a crazy plot take the viewer right back to the theme of the movie, choose your "wants" lightly because they just might turn out to be your "want nots".

    You've gotta hand it to the Coen brothers, they sure know how to inject style and flamboyance in their creations. And to think that "Raising Arizona" was only their second feature film makes the accomplishment even more impressive although "Blood Simple." was powerful enough an announcement of two upcoming talents threatening to shake Hollywood's conventions with a unique sense of eccentricity, and human depth. "Blood Simple." was still borrowing some elements from film-noir and Hitchcock movies, and, no matter how effective it was, it could have easily been targeted as an exercise in style. This is why the Coen brothers couldn't have made a better choice by making a zany comedy with a tender and more optimistic tone. And not only the film works but "Raising Arizona" is now a comedy classic, so special that it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath than 80's comedies for the simple reason that it differs from what was made in that decade. And that's the thing about the Coen brothers, they make timeless films, set in universes, playing like crossroads between fantasy and reality, where their stories float with a bizarre but so penetrating poetry. I know this is a Coen brothers' so we're tempted to get deeper on the subject. Granted it's not just a story about two people who kidnap a baby because they can't have one, there are far more symbolism and philosophical material lying underneath the screwball carapace, but how about enjoying the film for what it is: one hilarious piece of cinematic greatness carried by the kind of colorful cast that made the Coen's films so lively. And what a cast! Nicolas Cage is H.I. aka "Hi" McDunnough, a multiple recidivist specialized in robbing market stores and Holly Hunter is Edwina aka 'Ed', the photographer who took so many mug shots she ended up proving that indeed, opposites attracted. But the Coen brothers are not the type of directors to comfortably sit on the presence of two solid protagonist, they know supporting characters are the spices that give the film its flavor. So, we have the two escaped prison buddies, two brothers played by two Johns, John Goodman, who'd become one of the Coen's greatest asset with such a physical presence he'd steal the show anytime, anywhere and Forsythe as his dim-witted brother. There is Sam McMumurray as Glen, the bourgeois pain-in-the-ass and the late Trey Wilson as Nathan Arizona, father of cute blonde-haired quints, the furniture magnate whose motto consist on concluding all his statements with "or my name isn't Nathan Arizona". Each character illuminates the screen with a unique presence, even little Nathan Jr. makes you believe people would kill each other to get him, and Frances McDormand is given a less important play but plays it with the required over-the-top way you'd expect from the woman who chose a guy like Glen for husband. Speaking of Glen, nothing against Sam McMurray but I would have loved to see John Turturro playing his part, if only because it would have made "Raising Arizona"'s the consummate Coen brothers' film, with characters before stories. Hell, it goes even to the point where the most seemingly inoffensive market-cashier can tot a gunshot and become a Dirty Harry-like figure, no one is to be underestimated, not when laughs are at stakes. Naturally, such story deserves a worthy villain and this is where Randal 'Tex' Cobb makes his entrances, as a man coming from nowhere, supposedly incarnating the devil, whenever he goes, grass never grow back and this modern Atilla of biker of the apocalypse first emerges in HI's dream after he stole Nathan's kid. He symbolizes HI's conscience, something that will torment him until he finds the way to redeem himself, and this is the philosophical stuff hidden beneath the film, it's about characters doing morally wrong things, and finding their own path to redemption. When a recidivist teams up with a cop and both stole parents' fruits of love, you know this ain't the way to reach marital happiness. And the whole narrative is cooked up up in typical Mid-West accent, flirting with caricature but giving "Raising Arizona"its colorful spirit, the same as "Fargo" with its overuse of Scandinavian accent made of "Yah" and "You betcha". This is the Coens' signature and it doesn't limit to dialogs but goes to the soundtrack and from the title to the score, you have the hillbilly thing screaming all over the place. Till today, it's impossible not to hear "Raising Arizona" without having that fast-paced upbeat banjo music and catchy yodel that makes you want to escape from whatever makes your routine. You got it, "Raising Arizona" is pure entertaining escapism, with a man and a woman giving their life a meaning the wrong way, before learning the lessons, the hard way. And what a lesson! the conclusion of the film is probably the most insightful and beautiful thing ever put in a film, transcending the limits of comedies to something that cuts straight to your heart. And by the way, I couldn't believe Roger Ebert's review, my only guess he didn't have enough perspective and he probably changed his mind after. But thanks to Ebert, I learned the definition of a good movie, from Howard Hawks' quote. It's made of three good scenes and no bad scenes. There are none in "Raising Arizona" and there are three mesmerizing sequences: one of the most promising and funny introductions ever, then the market scene that reinvents the foot-chase forever, and made it deeply intertwined with hillbilly yodel like banjo music did for "Bonnie and Clyde", and ten you have one of the most poignant and meaningful monologues ever. There are three great moments in "Raising Arizona", in the beginning, the middle and the ending, and if only for these moments, with so many laughs in-between, "Raising Arizona" is one of the greatest comedies ever  or my IMDb user name isn't ElMaruecan82.

    The Coen Brothers have made many great films and worked in many different genres. One of their most famous comedies is Raising Arizona, a fast paced, zany comedy that can only come from the minds of the Coens. H.I. "Hi" McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) is a career criminal who falls for policewoman Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter) and goes straight for her. After they get married they attempt to have a child, but when Ed finds out she is infertile and the pair unable to adopt the couple take the logically route of kidnapping a baby from a wealthy couple who have just had quintuplets. But their actions get complicated by two escaped convicted, a police investigation and a ruthless bounty hunter. Raising Arizona is a very funny comedy that zips along at a great pace. The Coens' fingerprints are all over this film, having a sharply written script and excellent direction throughout. The jokes are constant throughout the film, giving us a variety of style of humour, from great one-liners, character interactions and pure physical comedy. The Coens bring a lot of energy to the film as we get over the top set pieces like the robbery where Ed abandons Hi and the Coens being a brings a kinetic style with their camera movements and editing of set pieces. We get a great prologue at the beginning of the film as we find out about Hi and Ed's past and how they came to their solution with funny jokes on the way. As well as the direction, Raising Arizona is blessed with a top cast who give both comic and sincere performances. Cage and Hunter had great chemistry together, having excellent comic time and were committed to their roles. Cage worked well with his supporting cast as they assemble a top cast: John Goodman being a particular highlight as one of the escaped prisoners. The Coens Brothers' direction is frantic through the film, using fast paced editing, hand-held cameras and tracking shots, amplifying the comedy, showing this maniac universe and gives Raising Arizona a distinctive visual style. The Coen's regular composer Carter Burwell also supplies a great score for the film, particular the use of a country/folk like guitar score which was a perfect fit for the film. Raising Arizona is a very entertaining, funny and heartfelt comedy that can stand along some of the best works the Coen Brothers have had to offer. It is a screwball comedy that can cater to many tests from intelligent jokes, observations and character interactions, to more over the top physical and visual comedy.

    Honestly, I did not expect even the first Cohen brothers films to be really good. This one definitely is worth watching because the seriousness with which Cohen brothers make frivolous movies is best and this time. Busy throughout the film to make the foreground absurd or to the characters or to the situations in which they fall in, the two filmmakers get us into the world of attracting of opposites. Line from the movie, which can serve as an example here would be: "If a frog had wings, it would hardly hitting the legs into the body when jumping." In equally absurd way arises the love between a young policewoman and obsessive in robberies of shops criminal (collection of fools, as they point themselves). As she turns frigid, they decide to steal a child from a newly born five twins. And thus began the mess that does not stop until the end. The film is ideal for detente and kicking a bad mood and driving a good one.

    Raising Arizona is easily one of the funniest,greatest and most original Comedies of all time and a timeless film classic. Filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a wonderful screenplay,truly beautiful cinematography and an unforgettable score,Raising Arizona is The Coen Brothers at their best and greatest. Raising Arizona tells the story of H.I. McDunnough(Nicholas Cage),a criminal and repeat offender and police officer 'Ed' Edwina(Holly Hunter)who fall in love and after falling in love decide to get married and have kids. When H.I. and Ed can't conceive kids of their own,H.I and Ed kidnap a quintuplet,Nathan Arizona JR(T.J Kuhn JR) one of the children of local business man Nathan Arizona(Trey Wilson). When H.I and Ed take Nathan J.r and want to raise him as their own wild and hilarious things happen in their lives. Raising Arizona is one of the all-time great classic Comedies from The Coen Brothers that came after their amazing film debut Blood Simple. When filmmakers have a first film that is so acclaimed and well loved, most filmmakers have to do a second film that lives up to the quality of their first film and not only does Raising Arizona live up to Blood Simple but also gives viewers and brilliant and much lighter cinematic experience. One of the reasons Raising Arizona is excellent and truly hilarious is because The Coen Brothers have given us a flawless film that combines great laughs with style and substance where everything in the film is over the top and exaggerated to the point of going over the top beyond belief. The laughs and humor in the film are funny,ingenious and original with hilarious Slapstick Comedy,funny dialog and moments in the movie that have you laughing until your stomach hurts and will have tears running down your face. The laughs are so crazy and over the top you will you're watching a surreal live Action Cartoon. What is also great about the Humor in this film and other Coen Brother films is that the laughs are subtle and used in visuals and imagery that are not obvious the first time you watch RA but when you watch the film with multiple viewings you will notice or catch some of the visual jokes of the film. And speaking of of visuals RA is one of the most beautiful and visually stunning Comedies I have ever seen. Barry Sonnefield's photography is amazing and powerful with wide angle shots,close ups and shots of the sunlight,road and dusty world of Arizona. Sonnefield's photography gives the film a surreal and wild energy that you don't see in most comedies and that is one of the great things that set RZ apart from other films of it's type because RA can have wonderful style but also a great substance. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is hilarious and well and one of the best screenplays in Comedy history with the Coens giving the main great dialog that is funny,memorable and stylized as well as greatly using narration for H.I. McDunnough and lines from the main characters that are quotable and will stay in your mind. The two main characters H.I. and Ed McDunnough while over the top and are cartoon characters who are funny but are given great depth and humanity and you feel like the two truly love and care for one another and even though H.I and Ed kidnapped a baby they don't do for fame or money,they do it because they want to be parents and want to love a child and the kidnapping make the main characters more complex than they truly are and that is one of things that great about RA and the Coens. Although not an Action film RA has a couple of good Action and chase scenes that are thrilling and exciting. Especially the film's main chase scene which is one of the funniest,wildest,original and over the top chase scenes in film history and it is a classic chase that that you will never forget. The ending of the film is funny,beautiful and very optimistic and will make you wonder what will happen to H.I and ED. An great ending to a great film. The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Nicholas Cage is brilliant,funny and at his best as H.I McDunnough,with Cage bringing laughs and depth to the role. Holly Hunter is excellent as 'Ed' Edwina McDunnough,with Hunter feisty and funny and having great chemistry with Cage. Trey Wilson is wonderful and fun as Nathan Arizona,a local business man. John Goodman and William Forsythe are great,funny and over the top as Gale and Evelle Snoats,escaped convicts who are H.I's friends. Sam McMurray and Francis McDormand are amazing and hilarious as husband and wife Glen and Dot,friends of H.I. and Ed. Randell 'Tex' Cobb is fantastic as Leonard Smalls,a man hunter who's a man of few words and is looking for Nathan JR. The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is excellent,with The Coens always moving the camera,using wide angles,low angles,close-ups and giving the film a great visual style. Great direction by The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is is amazing,funny,beautiful and very quirky and matches the tone of the film,with Burwell greatly mixing whistles,yodeling,organs and banjos. Wonderful score by Burwell. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you check out Raising Arizona,a truly hilarious,funny and unforgettable Comedy and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I adore this one. I'll have you know it is my 'feelgood' movie, having seen it now a dozen times it never fails to lift my spirits. After some deliberation, I am finally putting it on my list of must see films. What the Coens have done here is a very delicate thing. The obvious first. What you see in the film is both 'real', a loving trailer trash couple cannot conceive a child, and sleepless bending of reality as the urge to steal one so they can finally have a 'full family unit' manifests around them in all sorts of crazy situations. The biker from Hell is the tip of the thread, first dreamed about and in a weird confluence of forces soon appears in reality as dreamed. From that point on, everything is askew while pointing to anxious dreaming. Prison pals from HI's criminal past show up in the middle of the night. The frantic hunt for Huggies, starting with another botched holdup. HI's boss as the dreary dead-end of family life. More obvious, the business with the hole in the ground. It isn't simply surreal, a term normally associated with vaguely weird stream-of-consciousness. It's film noir, the film is sandwiched after all between the much more openly noirish Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. The Coens get noir, where the desire for life to be other/better than it is (not for sex or money as in noir, but blissful family life here personified in the baby) causes peculiar whims in perception, and those whims mysteriously manifest in the narrator's 'choosing' of the reality he remembers, collapsing in the process. Noir is magical, alluring to this day, because all those things are causally inextricable, desire from dream or memory from mysterious happenings in the story, which is why we often collapse the whole knotted mess to the workings of some celestial fate. There's all sorts of stuff woven on top. Reagan's morning in America as neurotic hyper-normalcy, the bum HI as the flipside of that, laid-back and tied to the American tradition of glorified frontiersmen and criminals, lampooned in the biker. 1980's suburbia as consumerist limbo. It's a helluva ride. Next to Blue Velvet and Society, the definitive 1980's film. It does all sort of collapse together by the end, which supports and enhances the idea of the random , whimsical arising of dreams. Big Lebowski starts here. Its charm? You can 'get' this without 'getting' it. The whole Huggies sequence is as profound to me as any cinematic dream. But it isn't like Tarkovksy who bypasses the mind by long mystifying sweeps, hitting deep in this way. It strikes an amazing balance between self-conscious intelligent conception and the bypass in spontaneous asides of fun and tremendous heartHI and Ed (the lovely Holly Hunter) are one of the most loving couples in filmdom. Intelligence, fun and emotion, these three are inextricable. This being so, you can 'get' the film via any route. It ends with an Ozzie and Harriet movie dream of the perfect life.

    Criminal Herbert I. "Hi" (Nicolas Cage) after his continued visits to a prison happens to marry Edwina "Ed" after his latest release from prison. Soon the couple discovers that Ed is not fit to be a mother and are unable to adopt a baby due to Ed's Criminal record. So they decide to kidnap one of the Quints of a local furniture magnate "Nathan Arizona" believing it to be Nathan Jr. Problems arouse as Hi is visited by his prison buddies and he thinks of returning to his notorious lifestyle along with his supervisor discovering that kid is not his after he made an unsuccessful wife swapping offer to him. Matters get worse as a bounty hunter named Leo Smalls gets in search of Nathan Jr. to sell him in the market and Hi's buddies taking undue advantage of junior's identity. Do watch this early Coen Bros. movie because of some great comic scenes especially the scene where Hi steals a pack of diapers and it is one of those movies that gives us the insight into the kind of characters the duo generates, dialogues they write and unconventional music score that became symbolic for their future movies. MY RATING: 9/10

    The film Raising Arizona begins with the unfortunate life of H.I. McDunnough (Nicholas Cage) and his journeys in and out of prison where he meets his future wife, Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter), a corrections officer. The two get married and discover that they cannot have children of their own, despite their beliefs that they are good people and would make great parents. Around that time, Nathan and Florence Arizona (Trey Wilson and Lynne Kitei) give birth to quintuplets, and discover that so many children are "more than they can handle!" The McDunnoughs, with their good intentions in hand, kidnap one of the quintuplets to raise as their own, believing that they are doing the Arizona's a favor. The primary theme of this film is the effects of karma, or the idea that "what goes around comes around." This theme can be found throughout the film, as characters like Gale and Evelle Snoats (John Goodman and William Forsythe) fail in their attempt to rob a bank and eventually return to jail. The theme can also be found through the consequences that the McDunnoughs face as a result of the kidnapping, and the reactions of Nathan Arizona when he finally learns what has happened to his son. The primary tool used to explain the theme of the film is the voice-over. A voice-over can be used to fill in gaps and make a film cohesive, or to explain background or contextual information to the viewer (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). In Raising Arizona, the voice-over is used for both reasons, and gives thorough insights into the thoughts and motives of the characters. This tool is very effective in conveying the theme of the film in that sense. The acting throughout the film is also very effective in helping to convey the theme of the film. H.I. is a very innocent character, despite his many crimes, and the acting portrays this well. Ed is another na&iuml;ve character, who does not fully understand the consequences of her actions. As both of these characters begin to realize the consequences of their actions, they begin to take responsibility for them and try to do what is best for everyone. In that sense, both actors help to contribute to the theme of the film by effectively displaying the emotions and motivations of their characters. The theme of this film is similar to the themes of many other films, like, for example, the film Elf, where the primary character, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell), acts on his good intentions, even when his actions may not be the right thing to do. For example, in one scene, Buddy gets in a fight with a store "Santa" (Artie Lange) because Buddy knows that the man is an imposter. The message of this film is very important to everyone, because good intentions are very important, but it is still important that one always tries to do what is right. Though they may have started off on the wrong path, Ed and H.I. finally make amends and do what is right for everyone involved in the situation. References Boggs, J. M. & Petrie, D. W. (2008).

    Raising Arizona is a film that follows the story of an unconventional couple; convict Hi (Cage) and police officer Ed (Hunter), as they attempt to find harmony and happiness in their lives together. However, their greatest obstacle is Ed's sterility that slowly wears on their relationship and threatens their sanity until opportunity arises in the form of a wealthy local whose wife births "more than she can handle". Accomplishing the abduction proves a bit difficult, but the rabid persistence of Ed drives their mission to success, and with the addition of this vital piece, it seems a true family is born. Unfortunately, prying and obnoxious colleagues, mischievous jailbirds/buddies, and a gritty detective with a Harley threaten their happiness, but also demonstrate how misguided and selfish their actions have been. Returning the baby to an appreciative and surprisingly sympathetic father, Hi reflects on the affection we have for children, even if they're not our own and is able to sleep peacefully with dreams for the future that he hopes holds a family of his very own. I generally appreciate the Coen Brother's films and what I appreciate most is their ability to hold interest of the audience through plot twists and strong characters; there's nothing extreme or very showy about their work and yet it stands out because there is only ever and illusion of normalcy and sanity in their characters or the plot, really the work is quite complex but we appreciate it more because they make no pretense. Raising Arizona continues this tradition and also has quite a flavor of Americana, enhanced greatly by the colorful characters. The humor was ludicrous most times, but it was balanced through the sensitive and reflective nature of the protagonist, whose broodings lend itself to the underlying sense of loneliness and hopelessness of the characters and the landscape and drive the rich plot forward. I feel that any criticism would simply be void for two reasons: I believe that this film is very stylistic and I don't believe that they ventured out of this particular structure, any risk they took (including the dream sequences) had basis in reality and only served to give the film more poetic flavor, and secondly, I believe that the film was unique and heartfelt among it's genre, which at times is difficult to achieve in something externally so seemingly detached as comedy, and mainly, I think there was valid reasoning behind it's creation, which is my only objection with modern film. The cinematography of the film was very interesting and was able to keep the audience occupied by the sheer amount of stimulation the wild camera movements brought. I was able to appreciate the shaky camera work simply because I think it does justice to Hi's convict past as well as his current lifestyle, punctuated by his most daring criminal offense yet. This apparently dramatic and brutal world is something that few of us can sympathize with and I think the long takes through several different environments contributes to that foreign aspect of the film that quite frankly makes it hilarious. Motifs in the film include the joined hands of Hi and Ed, representing their bond and their support of each other, the fire that erupts from the detective, representing his nature, and the convenient store that represents Hi's temptation or the pull of his old life. The brothers use this as well as a few non-diegetic inserts (including baby toys) to bring a bit of understanding to the rapidly moving plot, but it is interesting to note that this veers a bit from the slapstick genre that is quite shallow and brings a poetic aspect to the film. In the abduction scene the use of high-angle and low-angle shots capture flawlessly both the perspective of Hi and of the babies and the power shift that takes place between them, succeeding in making Hi seem vulnerable among these small creatures. Also, throughout the entire film the use of the wide-angle lens is used, making people and surroundings seem distorted and often a bit out of proportion. The abduction scene demonstrates the use of this very well, especially when the babies are taking a very long time to reach the door and then the end of the hallway, giving Hi enough time to catch them before Mrs. Arizona discovers. This also contributes to the suspense of the scene, because everything seems to take longer to happen and Hi is running out of time to act. Off-screen action and voice is used quite a bit to stage a change in events in the plot and repetition of certain events forming a montage is comedic as well as clarity inducing. It really strikes both emotional stances quite well and makes for a heartfelt and poetic take on the slapstick comedy genre, aided by the strong narrative voice that guides us through a ridiculous and tragic journey of an unlikely couple trying to find the missing piece in their family.

    A quick checklist for anyone considering this movie: 1. Coenheads - if you are one, proceed to checkout 2. Hollow humorist - if you like to be force fed your humor, you're in luck. 3. Bicoastalism - plenty of middle/Southern/Western stereotypes here 4. Amateur Auteurs - Watch this film so you can earn your "I'm-more- sophisticated-than-you" pin. All others should bypass this cinematic desert. It has been said that much art is devised to impress other artists. I think that attitude is central to Coeney Island, and this film certainly falls into the category euphemistically called "quirky". Products such as this can't be blamed for aiming squarely at their intended audience. If you like this kind of pseudo-intellectual fare, bully for you. There are plenty of vendors for this kind of ware. All others who will try to find anything substantial will be sorely disappointed. You won't experience wildness, depth, sentiment, wonder, fury, intrigue, edginess, insight, lasciviousness, or even a good joke. In fact, what's really missing is honesty. You will be served up mounds of pretense and self-important contrivance, infused with long-expired sophomorism, and powdered with clip art humanism. Package above with ,uh, quirky dialogue (hard to assign that term since the characters don't express anything to each other or the audience) and you have all the haughty form-over-substance. cookie-cutter originality that the anesthetized soul craves. It was finely-crafted bubble-wrap, I admit that.

    Raising Arizona is a not-so-funny comedy surrounding the marriage and infertility of ex-cop, Ed McDonnough (Holly Hunter) and her ex-con husband, H.I. (Nicolas Cage). When the couple is told by her doctor that they would not be able to conceive a child of their own, Ed is devastated. While watching television one evening, the couple sees that Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), a rich, furniture store owner and his wife were now the proud parents of quintuplets. Ed concocts a plan to "borrow" one of their babies because she believes they "have their hands full" with 5 babies. This in turn sets off a crazy string of events which leave the couple in a fight for their "borrowed" child, their freedom and their love for one another. The theme of Raising Arizona is a character's struggle within themselves to soothe the constant "wants" in life that are not necessarily needed. Throughout the movie, Ed just wants to be happy. Before marrying H.I., she just wanted to meet the right man and get married. During one scene when Ed is booking H.I. into one of his many jail stints, she is sobbing because her then fianc&eacute;' had broken up with her. This was the first time that Ed realized that she had feelings for H.I., when he showed compassion for her and told her that her fianc&eacute;' had to be stupid to leave her. Soon after, Ed and H.I. were married and she immediately wanted to start having babies. This proved to be impossible for them and her desperate "want" to be a mother caused her to grow depressed, lose interest in everything - including cleaning her house and she lost her job. H.I. just seems to be along for the crazy ride. The wild story line and almost unfathomable shenanigans in this movie are somewhat similar to the 1990 Dennis Dugan movie, Problem Child, starring John Ritter. In both movies, there are couples who desperately want to have a child and when they are both given what they want it proves to be much more than they can handle. Both movies are filled with conflict and chaos right up to the very end. The motifs and camera angles brought out the theme of this movie and made it more exciting to watch. Throughout the movie the viewer is constantly reminded that Ed wants a baby and after Baby Arizona is "borrowed", the camera is fixated on how Ed and H.I. plan to keep him and keep their secret. The camera techniques were great in this movie. There were several parallel cuts that took the viewer back and forth between two different locations as the suspense was rising. In one particular scene, Ed, H.I. and Baby Jr. are driving home from spending a day with friends and they pull into a store to pick up some diapers. H.I. is tempted to resort to his old ways and ends up robbing the store. Ed sees him through the window and immediately becomes angry and drives away, leaving him to fend for himself. What H.I. doesn't anticipate though, is the store clerk is ready for him. After pushing an emergency button to alert the authorities, the clerk pulls out a rifle and starts shooting at H.I. Just as he is running away the cops pull up and start a wild chase. The cameras cut back and forth between H.I. running through streets, yards and houses, the cops chasing him and Ed, who had a change of heart about leaving him and decides to go back and try to help save him from the police. All of the chaos and goofy humor combined with a crazy plot take the viewer right back to the theme of the movie, choose your "wants" lightly because they just might turn out to be your "want nots".

    You've gotta hand it to the Coen brothers, they sure know how to inject style and flamboyance in their creations. And to think that "Raising Arizona" was only their second feature film makes the accomplishment even more impressive although "Blood Simple." was powerful enough an announcement of two upcoming talents threatening to shake Hollywood's conventions with a unique sense of eccentricity, and human depth. "Blood Simple." was still borrowing some elements from film-noir and Hitchcock movies, and, no matter how effective it was, it could have easily been targeted as an exercise in style. This is why the Coen brothers couldn't have made a better choice by making a zany comedy with a tender and more optimistic tone. And not only the film works but "Raising Arizona" is now a comedy classic, so special that it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath than 80's comedies for the simple reason that it differs from what was made in that decade. And that's the thing about the Coen brothers, they make timeless films, set in universes, playing like crossroads between fantasy and reality, where their stories float with a bizarre but so penetrating poetry. I know this is a Coen brothers' so we're tempted to get deeper on the subject. Granted it's not just a story about two people who kidnap a baby because they can't have one, there are far more symbolism and philosophical material lying underneath the screwball carapace, but how about enjoying the film for what it is: one hilarious piece of cinematic greatness carried by the kind of colorful cast that made the Coen's films so lively. And what a cast! Nicolas Cage is H.I. aka "Hi" McDunnough, a multiple recidivist specialized in robbing market stores and Holly Hunter is Edwina aka 'Ed', the photographer who took so many mug shots she ended up proving that indeed, opposites attracted. But the Coen brothers are not the type of directors to comfortably sit on the presence of two solid protagonist, they know supporting characters are the spices that give the film its flavor. So, we have the two escaped prison buddies, two brothers played by two Johns, John Goodman, who'd become one of the Coen's greatest asset with such a physical presence he'd steal the show anytime, anywhere and Forsythe as his dim-witted brother. There is Sam McMumurray as Glen, the bourgeois pain-in-the-ass and the late Trey Wilson as Nathan Arizona, father of cute blonde-haired quints, the furniture magnate whose motto consist on concluding all his statements with "or my name isn't Nathan Arizona". Each character illuminates the screen with a unique presence, even little Nathan Jr. makes you believe people would kill each other to get him, and Frances McDormand is given a less important play but plays it with the required over-the-top way you'd expect from the woman who chose a guy like Glen for husband. Speaking of Glen, nothing against Sam McMurray but I would have loved to see John Turturro playing his part, if only because it would have made "Raising Arizona"'s the consummate Coen brothers' film, with characters before stories. Hell, it goes even to the point where the most seemingly inoffensive market-cashier can tot a gunshot and become a Dirty Harry-like figure, no one is to be underestimated, not when laughs are at stakes. Naturally, such story deserves a worthy villain and this is where Randal 'Tex' Cobb makes his entrances, as a man coming from nowhere, supposedly incarnating the devil, whenever he goes, grass never grow back and this modern Atilla of biker of the apocalypse first emerges in HI's dream after he stole Nathan's kid. He symbolizes HI's conscience, something that will torment him until he finds the way to redeem himself, and this is the philosophical stuff hidden beneath the film, it's about characters doing morally wrong things, and finding their own path to redemption. When a recidivist teams up with a cop and both stole parents' fruits of love, you know this ain't the way to reach marital happiness. And the whole narrative is cooked up up in typical Mid-West accent, flirting with caricature but giving "Raising Arizona"its colorful spirit, the same as "Fargo" with its overuse of Scandinavian accent made of "Yah" and "You betcha". This is the Coens' signature and it doesn't limit to dialogs but goes to the soundtrack and from the title to the score, you have the hillbilly thing screaming all over the place. Till today, it's impossible not to hear "Raising Arizona" without having that fast-paced upbeat banjo music and catchy yodel that makes you want to escape from whatever makes your routine. You got it, "Raising Arizona" is pure entertaining escapism, with a man and a woman giving their life a meaning the wrong way, before learning the lessons, the hard way. And what a lesson! the conclusion of the film is probably the most insightful and beautiful thing ever put in a film, transcending the limits of comedies to something that cuts straight to your heart. And by the way, I couldn't believe Roger Ebert's review, my only guess he didn't have enough perspective and he probably changed his mind after. But thanks to Ebert, I learned the definition of a good movie, from Howard Hawks' quote. It's made of three good scenes and no bad scenes. There are none in "Raising Arizona" and there are three mesmerizing sequences: one of the most promising and funny introductions ever, then the market scene that reinvents the foot-chase forever, and made it deeply intertwined with hillbilly yodel like banjo music did for "Bonnie and Clyde", and ten you have one of the most poignant and meaningful monologues ever. There are three great moments in "Raising Arizona", in the beginning, the middle and the ending, and if only for these moments, with so many laughs in-between, "Raising Arizona" is one of the greatest comedies ever  or my IMDb user name isn't ElMaruecan82.

    The Coen Brothers have made many great films and worked in many different genres. One of their most famous comedies is Raising Arizona, a fast paced, zany comedy that can only come from the minds of the Coens. H.I. "Hi" McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) is a career criminal who falls for policewoman Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter) and goes straight for her. After they get married they attempt to have a child, but when Ed finds out she is infertile and the pair unable to adopt the couple take the logically route of kidnapping a baby from a wealthy couple who have just had quintuplets. But their actions get complicated by two escaped convicted, a police investigation and a ruthless bounty hunter. Raising Arizona is a very funny comedy that zips along at a great pace. The Coens' fingerprints are all over this film, having a sharply written script and excellent direction throughout. The jokes are constant throughout the film, giving us a variety of style of humour, from great one-liners, character interactions and pure physical comedy. The Coens bring a lot of energy to the film as we get over the top set pieces like the robbery where Ed abandons Hi and the Coens being a brings a kinetic style with their camera movements and editing of set pieces. We get a great prologue at the beginning of the film as we find out about Hi and Ed's past and how they came to their solution with funny jokes on the way. As well as the direction, Raising Arizona is blessed with a top cast who give both comic and sincere performances. Cage and Hunter had great chemistry together, having excellent comic time and were committed to their roles. Cage worked well with his supporting cast as they assemble a top cast: John Goodman being a particular highlight as one of the escaped prisoners. The Coens Brothers' direction is frantic through the film, using fast paced editing, hand-held cameras and tracking shots, amplifying the comedy, showing this maniac universe and gives Raising Arizona a distinctive visual style. The Coen's regular composer Carter Burwell also supplies a great score for the film, particular the use of a country/folk like guitar score which was a perfect fit for the film. Raising Arizona is a very entertaining, funny and heartfelt comedy that can stand along some of the best works the Coen Brothers have had to offer. It is a screwball comedy that can cater to many tests from intelligent jokes, observations and character interactions, to more over the top physical and visual comedy.

    Honestly, I did not expect even the first Cohen brothers films to be really good. This one definitely is worth watching because the seriousness with which Cohen brothers make frivolous movies is best and this time. Busy throughout the film to make the foreground absurd or to the characters or to the situations in which they fall in, the two filmmakers get us into the world of attracting of opposites. Line from the movie, which can serve as an example here would be: "If a frog had wings, it would hardly hitting the legs into the body when jumping." In equally absurd way arises the love between a young policewoman and obsessive in robberies of shops criminal (collection of fools, as they point themselves). As she turns frigid, they decide to steal a child from a newly born five twins. And thus began the mess that does not stop until the end. The film is ideal for detente and kicking a bad mood and driving a good one.

    Raising Arizona is easily one of the funniest,greatest and most original Comedies of all time and a timeless film classic. Filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a wonderful screenplay,truly beautiful cinematography and an unforgettable score,Raising Arizona is The Coen Brothers at their best and greatest. Raising Arizona tells the story of H.I. McDunnough(Nicholas Cage),a criminal and repeat offender and police officer 'Ed' Edwina(Holly Hunter)who fall in love and after falling in love decide to get married and have kids. When H.I. and Ed can't conceive kids of their own,H.I and Ed kidnap a quintuplet,Nathan Arizona JR(T.J Kuhn JR) one of the children of local business man Nathan Arizona(Trey Wilson). When H.I and Ed take Nathan J.r and want to raise him as their own wild and hilarious things happen in their lives. Raising Arizona is one of the all-time great classic Comedies from The Coen Brothers that came after their amazing film debut Blood Simple. When filmmakers have a first film that is so acclaimed and well loved, most filmmakers have to do a second film that lives up to the quality of their first film and not only does Raising Arizona live up to Blood Simple but also gives viewers and brilliant and much lighter cinematic experience. One of the reasons Raising Arizona is excellent and truly hilarious is because The Coen Brothers have given us a flawless film that combines great laughs with style and substance where everything in the film is over the top and exaggerated to the point of going over the top beyond belief. The laughs and humor in the film are funny,ingenious and original with hilarious Slapstick Comedy,funny dialog and moments in the movie that have you laughing until your stomach hurts and will have tears running down your face. The laughs are so crazy and over the top you will you're watching a surreal live Action Cartoon. What is also great about the Humor in this film and other Coen Brother films is that the laughs are subtle and used in visuals and imagery that are not obvious the first time you watch RA but when you watch the film with multiple viewings you will notice or catch some of the visual jokes of the film. And speaking of of visuals RA is one of the most beautiful and visually stunning Comedies I have ever seen. Barry Sonnefield's photography is amazing and powerful with wide angle shots,close ups and shots of the sunlight,road and dusty world of Arizona. Sonnefield's photography gives the film a surreal and wild energy that you don't see in most comedies and that is one of the great things that set RZ apart from other films of it's type because RA can have wonderful style but also a great substance. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is hilarious and well and one of the best screenplays in Comedy history with the Coens giving the main great dialog that is funny,memorable and stylized as well as greatly using narration for H.I. McDunnough and lines from the main characters that are quotable and will stay in your mind. The two main characters H.I. and Ed McDunnough while over the top and are cartoon characters who are funny but are given great depth and humanity and you feel like the two truly love and care for one another and even though H.I and Ed kidnapped a baby they don't do for fame or money,they do it because they want to be parents and want to love a child and the kidnapping make the main characters more complex than they truly are and that is one of things that great about RA and the Coens. Although not an Action film RA has a couple of good Action and chase scenes that are thrilling and exciting. Especially the film's main chase scene which is one of the funniest,wildest,original and over the top chase scenes in film history and it is a classic chase that that you will never forget. The ending of the film is funny,beautiful and very optimistic and will make you wonder what will happen to H.I and ED. An great ending to a great film. The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Nicholas Cage is brilliant,funny and at his best as H.I McDunnough,with Cage bringing laughs and depth to the role. Holly Hunter is excellent as 'Ed' Edwina McDunnough,with Hunter feisty and funny and having great chemistry with Cage. Trey Wilson is wonderful and fun as Nathan Arizona,a local business man. John Goodman and William Forsythe are great,funny and over the top as Gale and Evelle Snoats,escaped convicts who are H.I's friends. Sam McMurray and Francis McDormand are amazing and hilarious as husband and wife Glen and Dot,friends of H.I. and Ed. Randell 'Tex' Cobb is fantastic as Leonard Smalls,a man hunter who's a man of few words and is looking for Nathan JR. The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is excellent,with The Coens always moving the camera,using wide angles,low angles,close-ups and giving the film a great visual style. Great direction by The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is is amazing,funny,beautiful and very quirky and matches the tone of the film,with Burwell greatly mixing whistles,yodeling,organs and banjos. Wonderful score by Burwell. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you check out Raising Arizona,a truly hilarious,funny and unforgettable Comedy and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I adore this one. I'll have you know it is my 'feelgood' movie, having seen it now a dozen times it never fails to lift my spirits. After some deliberation, I am finally putting it on my list of must see films. What the Coens have done here is a very delicate thing. The obvious first. What you see in the film is both 'real', a loving trailer trash couple cannot conceive a child, and sleepless bending of reality as the urge to steal one so they can finally have a 'full family unit' manifests around them in all sorts of crazy situations. The biker from Hell is the tip of the thread, first dreamed about and in a weird confluence of forces soon appears in reality as dreamed. From that point on, everything is askew while pointing to anxious dreaming. Prison pals from HI's criminal past show up in the middle of the night. The frantic hunt for Huggies, starting with another botched holdup. HI's boss as the dreary dead-end of family life. More obvious, the business with the hole in the ground. It isn't simply surreal, a term normally associated with vaguely weird stream-of-consciousness. It's film noir, the film is sandwiched after all between the much more openly noirish Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. The Coens get noir, where the desire for life to be other/better than it is (not for sex or money as in noir, but blissful family life here personified in the baby) causes peculiar whims in perception, and those whims mysteriously manifest in the narrator's 'choosing' of the reality he remembers, collapsing in the process. Noir is magical, alluring to this day, because all those things are causally inextricable, desire from dream or memory from mysterious happenings in the story, which is why we often collapse the whole knotted mess to the workings of some celestial fate. There's all sorts of stuff woven on top. Reagan's morning in America as neurotic hyper-normalcy, the bum HI as the flipside of that, laid-back and tied to the American tradition of glorified frontiersmen and criminals, lampooned in the biker. 1980's suburbia as consumerist limbo. It's a helluva ride. Next to Blue Velvet and Society, the definitive 1980's film. It does all sort of collapse together by the end, which supports and enhances the idea of the random , whimsical arising of dreams. Big Lebowski starts here. Its charm? You can 'get' this without 'getting' it. The whole Huggies sequence is as profound to me as any cinematic dream. But it isn't like Tarkovksy who bypasses the mind by long mystifying sweeps, hitting deep in this way. It strikes an amazing balance between self-conscious intelligent conception and the bypass in spontaneous asides of fun and tremendous heartHI and Ed (the lovely Holly Hunter) are one of the most loving couples in filmdom. Intelligence, fun and emotion, these three are inextricable. This being so, you can 'get' the film via any route. It ends with an Ozzie and Harriet movie dream of the perfect life.

    Criminal Herbert I. "Hi" (Nicolas Cage) after his continued visits to a prison happens to marry Edwina "Ed" after his latest release from prison. Soon the couple discovers that Ed is not fit to be a mother and are unable to adopt a baby due to Ed's Criminal record. So they decide to kidnap one of the Quints of a local furniture magnate "Nathan Arizona" believing it to be Nathan Jr. Problems arouse as Hi is visited by his prison buddies and he thinks of returning to his notorious lifestyle along with his supervisor discovering that kid is not his after he made an unsuccessful wife swapping offer to him. Matters get worse as a bounty hunter named Leo Smalls gets in search of Nathan Jr. to sell him in the market and Hi's buddies taking undue advantage of junior's identity. Do watch this early Coen Bros. movie because of some great comic scenes especially the scene where Hi steals a pack of diapers and it is one of those movies that gives us the insight into the kind of characters the duo generates, dialogues they write and unconventional music score that became symbolic for their future movies. MY RATING: 9/10

    The film Raising Arizona begins with the unfortunate life of H.I. McDunnough (Nicholas Cage) and his journeys in and out of prison where he meets his future wife, Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter), a corrections officer. The two get married and discover that they cannot have children of their own, despite their beliefs that they are good people and would make great parents. Around that time, Nathan and Florence Arizona (Trey Wilson and Lynne Kitei) give birth to quintuplets, and discover that so many children are "more than they can handle!" The McDunnoughs, with their good intentions in hand, kidnap one of the quintuplets to raise as their own, believing that they are doing the Arizona's a favor. The primary theme of this film is the effects of karma, or the idea that "what goes around comes around." This theme can be found throughout the film, as characters like Gale and Evelle Snoats (John Goodman and William Forsythe) fail in their attempt to rob a bank and eventually return to jail. The theme can also be found through the consequences that the McDunnoughs face as a result of the kidnapping, and the reactions of Nathan Arizona when he finally learns what has happened to his son. The primary tool used to explain the theme of the film is the voice-over. A voice-over can be used to fill in gaps and make a film cohesive, or to explain background or contextual information to the viewer (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). In Raising Arizona, the voice-over is used for both reasons, and gives thorough insights into the thoughts and motives of the characters. This tool is very effective in conveying the theme of the film in that sense. The acting throughout the film is also very effective in helping to convey the theme of the film. H.I. is a very innocent character, despite his many crimes, and the acting portrays this well. Ed is another na&iuml;ve character, who does not fully understand the consequences of her actions. As both of these characters begin to realize the consequences of their actions, they begin to take responsibility for them and try to do what is best for everyone. In that sense, both actors help to contribute to the theme of the film by effectively displaying the emotions and motivations of their characters. The theme of this film is similar to the themes of many other films, like, for example, the film Elf, where the primary character, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell), acts on his good intentions, even when his actions may not be the right thing to do. For example, in one scene, Buddy gets in a fight with a store "Santa" (Artie Lange) because Buddy knows that the man is an imposter. The message of this film is very important to everyone, because good intentions are very important, but it is still important that one always tries to do what is right. Though they may have started off on the wrong path, Ed and H.I. finally make amends and do what is right for everyone involved in the situation. References Boggs, J. M. & Petrie, D. W. (2008).

    Raising Arizona is a film that follows the story of an unconventional couple; convict Hi (Cage) and police officer Ed (Hunter), as they attempt to find harmony and happiness in their lives together. However, their greatest obstacle is Ed's sterility that slowly wears on their relationship and threatens their sanity until opportunity arises in the form of a wealthy local whose wife births "more than she can handle". Accomplishing the abduction proves a bit difficult, but the rabid persistence of Ed drives their mission to success, and with the addition of this vital piece, it seems a true family is born. Unfortunately, prying and obnoxious colleagues, mischievous jailbirds/buddies, and a gritty detective with a Harley threaten their happiness, but also demonstrate how misguided and selfish their actions have been. Returning the baby to an appreciative and surprisingly sympathetic father, Hi reflects on the affection we have for children, even if they're not our own and is able to sleep peacefully with dreams for the future that he hopes holds a family of his very own. I generally appreciate the Coen Brother's films and what I appreciate most is their ability to hold interest of the audience through plot twists and strong characters; there's nothing extreme or very showy about their work and yet it stands out because there is only ever and illusion of normalcy and sanity in their characters or the plot, really the work is quite complex but we appreciate it more because they make no pretense. Raising Arizona continues this tradition and also has quite a flavor of Americana, enhanced greatly by the colorful characters. The humor was ludicrous most times, but it was balanced through the sensitive and reflective nature of the protagonist, whose broodings lend itself to the underlying sense of loneliness and hopelessness of the characters and the landscape and drive the rich plot forward. I feel that any criticism would simply be void for two reasons: I believe that this film is very stylistic and I don't believe that they ventured out of this particular structure, any risk they took (including the dream sequences) had basis in reality and only served to give the film more poetic flavor, and secondly, I believe that the film was unique and heartfelt among it's genre, which at times is difficult to achieve in something externally so seemingly detached as comedy, and mainly, I think there was valid reasoning behind it's creation, which is my only objection with modern film. The cinematography of the film was very interesting and was able to keep the audience occupied by the sheer amount of stimulation the wild camera movements brought. I was able to appreciate the shaky camera work simply because I think it does justice to Hi's convict past as well as his current lifestyle, punctuated by his most daring criminal offense yet. This apparently dramatic and brutal world is something that few of us can sympathize with and I think the long takes through several different environments contributes to that foreign aspect of the film that quite frankly makes it hilarious. Motifs in the film include the joined hands of Hi and Ed, representing their bond and their support of each other, the fire that erupts from the detective, representing his nature, and the convenient store that represents Hi's temptation or the pull of his old life. The brothers use this as well as a few non-diegetic inserts (including baby toys) to bring a bit of understanding to the rapidly moving plot, but it is interesting to note that this veers a bit from the slapstick genre that is quite shallow and brings a poetic aspect to the film. In the abduction scene the use of high-angle and low-angle shots capture flawlessly both the perspective of Hi and of the babies and the power shift that takes place between them, succeeding in making Hi seem vulnerable among these small creatures. Also, throughout the entire film the use of the wide-angle lens is used, making people and surroundings seem distorted and often a bit out of proportion. The abduction scene demonstrates the use of this very well, especially when the babies are taking a very long time to reach the door and then the end of the hallway, giving Hi enough time to catch them before Mrs. Arizona discovers. This also contributes to the suspense of the scene, because everything seems to take longer to happen and Hi is running out of time to act. Off-screen action and voice is used quite a bit to stage a change in events in the plot and repetition of certain events forming a montage is comedic as well as clarity inducing. It really strikes both emotional stances quite well and makes for a heartfelt and poetic take on the slapstick comedy genre, aided by the strong narrative voice that guides us through a ridiculous and tragic journey of an unlikely couple trying to find the missing piece in their family.

    A quick checklist for anyone considering this movie: 1. Coenheads - if you are one, proceed to checkout 2. Hollow humorist - if you like to be force fed your humor, you're in luck. 3. Bicoastalism - plenty of middle/Southern/Western stereotypes here 4. Amateur Auteurs - Watch this film so you can earn your "I'm-more- sophisticated-than-you" pin. All others should bypass this cinematic desert. It has been said that much art is devised to impress other artists. I think that attitude is central to Coeney Island, and this film certainly falls into the category euphemistically called "quirky". Products such as this can't be blamed for aiming squarely at their intended audience. If you like this kind of pseudo-intellectual fare, bully for you. There are plenty of vendors for this kind of ware. All others who will try to find anything substantial will be sorely disappointed. You won't experience wildness, depth, sentiment, wonder, fury, intrigue, edginess, insight, lasciviousness, or even a good joke. In fact, what's really missing is honesty. You will be served up mounds of pretense and self-important contrivance, infused with long-expired sophomorism, and powdered with clip art humanism. Package above with ,uh, quirky dialogue (hard to assign that term since the characters don't express anything to each other or the audience) and you have all the haughty form-over-substance. cookie-cutter originality that the anesthetized soul craves. It was finely-crafted bubble-wrap, I admit that.

    Raising Arizona is a not-so-funny comedy surrounding the marriage and infertility of ex-cop, Ed McDonnough (Holly Hunter) and her ex-con husband, H.I. (Nicolas Cage). When the couple is told by her doctor that they would not be able to conceive a child of their own, Ed is devastated. While watching television one evening, the couple sees that Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), a rich, furniture store owner and his wife were now the proud parents of quintuplets. Ed concocts a plan to "borrow" one of their babies because she believes they "have their hands full" with 5 babies. This in turn sets off a crazy string of events which leave the couple in a fight for their "borrowed" child, their freedom and their love for one another. The theme of Raising Arizona is a character's struggle within themselves to soothe the constant "wants" in life that are not necessarily needed. Throughout the movie, Ed just wants to be happy. Before marrying H.I., she just wanted to meet the right man and get married. During one scene when Ed is booking H.I. into one of his many jail stints, she is sobbing because her then fianc&eacute;' had broken up with her. This was the first time that Ed realized that she had feelings for H.I., when he showed compassion for her and told her that her fianc&eacute;' had to be stupid to leave her. Soon after, Ed and H.I. were married and she immediately wanted to start having babies. This proved to be impossible for them and her desperate "want" to be a mother caused her to grow depressed, lose interest in everything - including cleaning her house and she lost her job. H.I. just seems to be along for the crazy ride. The wild story line and almost unfathomable shenanigans in this movie are somewhat similar to the 1990 Dennis Dugan movie, Problem Child, starring John Ritter. In both movies, there are couples who desperately want to have a child and when they are both given what they want it proves to be much more than they can handle. Both movies are filled with conflict and chaos right up to the very end. The motifs and camera angles brought out the theme of this movie and made it more exciting to watch. Throughout the movie the viewer is constantly reminded that Ed wants a baby and after Baby Arizona is "borrowed", the camera is fixated on how Ed and H.I. plan to keep him and keep their secret. The camera techniques were great in this movie. There were several parallel cuts that took the viewer back and forth between two different locations as the suspense was rising. In one particular scene, Ed, H.I. and Baby Jr. are driving home from spending a day with friends and they pull into a store to pick up some diapers. H.I. is tempted to resort to his old ways and ends up robbing the store. Ed sees him through the window and immediately becomes angry and drives away, leaving him to fend for himself. What H.I. doesn't anticipate though, is the store clerk is ready for him. After pushing an emergency button to alert the authorities, the clerk pulls out a rifle and starts shooting at H.I. Just as he is running away the cops pull up and start a wild chase. The cameras cut back and forth between H.I. running through streets, yards and houses, the cops chasing him and Ed, who had a change of heart about leaving him and decides to go back and try to help save him from the police. All of the chaos and goofy humor combined with a crazy plot take the viewer right back to the theme of the movie, choose your "wants" lightly because they just might turn out to be your "want nots".

    You've gotta hand it to the Coen brothers, they sure know how to inject style and flamboyance in their creations. And to think that "Raising Arizona" was only their second feature film makes the accomplishment even more impressive although "Blood Simple." was powerful enough an announcement of two upcoming talents threatening to shake Hollywood's conventions with a unique sense of eccentricity, and human depth. "Blood Simple." was still borrowing some elements from film-noir and Hitchcock movies, and, no matter how effective it was, it could have easily been targeted as an exercise in style. This is why the Coen brothers couldn't have made a better choice by making a zany comedy with a tender and more optimistic tone. And not only the film works but "Raising Arizona" is now a comedy classic, so special that it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath than 80's comedies for the simple reason that it differs from what was made in that decade. And that's the thing about the Coen brothers, they make timeless films, set in universes, playing like crossroads between fantasy and reality, where their stories float with a bizarre but so penetrating poetry. I know this is a Coen brothers' so we're tempted to get deeper on the subject. Granted it's not just a story about two people who kidnap a baby because they can't have one, there are far more symbolism and philosophical material lying underneath the screwball carapace, but how about enjoying the film for what it is: one hilarious piece of cinematic greatness carried by the kind of colorful cast that made the Coen's films so lively. And what a cast! Nicolas Cage is H.I. aka "Hi" McDunnough, a multiple recidivist specialized in robbing market stores and Holly Hunter is Edwina aka 'Ed', the photographer who took so many mug shots she ended up proving that indeed, opposites attracted. But the Coen brothers are not the type of directors to comfortably sit on the presence of two solid protagonist, they know supporting characters are the spices that give the film its flavor. So, we have the two escaped prison buddies, two brothers played by two Johns, John Goodman, who'd become one of the Coen's greatest asset with such a physical presence he'd steal the show anytime, anywhere and Forsythe as his dim-witted brother. There is Sam McMumurray as Glen, the bourgeois pain-in-the-ass and the late Trey Wilson as Nathan Arizona, father of cute blonde-haired quints, the furniture magnate whose motto consist on concluding all his statements with "or my name isn't Nathan Arizona". Each character illuminates the screen with a unique presence, even little Nathan Jr. makes you believe people would kill each other to get him, and Frances McDormand is given a less important play but plays it with the required over-the-top way you'd expect from the woman who chose a guy like Glen for husband. Speaking of Glen, nothing against Sam McMurray but I would have loved to see John Turturro playing his part, if only because it would have made "Raising Arizona"'s the consummate Coen brothers' film, with characters before stories. Hell, it goes even to the point where the most seemingly inoffensive market-cashier can tot a gunshot and become a Dirty Harry-like figure, no one is to be underestimated, not when laughs are at stakes. Naturally, such story deserves a worthy villain and this is where Randal 'Tex' Cobb makes his entrances, as a man coming from nowhere, supposedly incarnating the devil, whenever he goes, grass never grow back and this modern Atilla of biker of the apocalypse first emerges in HI's dream after he stole Nathan's kid. He symbolizes HI's conscience, something that will torment him until he finds the way to redeem himself, and this is the philosophical stuff hidden beneath the film, it's about characters doing morally wrong things, and finding their own path to redemption. When a recidivist teams up with a cop and both stole parents' fruits of love, you know this ain't the way to reach marital happiness. And the whole narrative is cooked up up in typical Mid-West accent, flirting with caricature but giving "Raising Arizona"its colorful spirit, the same as "Fargo" with its overuse of Scandinavian accent made of "Yah" and "You betcha". This is the Coens' signature and it doesn't limit to dialogs but goes to the soundtrack and from the title to the score, you have the hillbilly thing screaming all over the place. Till today, it's impossible not to hear "Raising Arizona" without having that fast-paced upbeat banjo music and catchy yodel that makes you want to escape from whatever makes your routine. You got it, "Raising Arizona" is pure entertaining escapism, with a man and a woman giving their life a meaning the wrong way, before learning the lessons, the hard way. And what a lesson! the conclusion of the film is probably the most insightful and beautiful thing ever put in a film, transcending the limits of comedies to something that cuts straight to your heart. And by the way, I couldn't believe Roger Ebert's review, my only guess he didn't have enough perspective and he probably changed his mind after. But thanks to Ebert, I learned the definition of a good movie, from Howard Hawks' quote. It's made of three good scenes and no bad scenes. There are none in "Raising Arizona" and there are three mesmerizing sequences: one of the most promising and funny introductions ever, then the market scene that reinvents the foot-chase forever, and made it deeply intertwined with hillbilly yodel like banjo music did for "Bonnie and Clyde", and ten you have one of the most poignant and meaningful monologues ever. There are three great moments in "Raising Arizona", in the beginning, the middle and the ending, and if only for these moments, with so many laughs in-between, "Raising Arizona" is one of the greatest comedies ever  or my IMDb user name isn't ElMaruecan82.

    The Coen Brothers have made many great films and worked in many different genres. One of their most famous comedies is Raising Arizona, a fast paced, zany comedy that can only come from the minds of the Coens. H.I. "Hi" McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) is a career criminal who falls for policewoman Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter) and goes straight for her. After they get married they attempt to have a child, but when Ed finds out she is infertile and the pair unable to adopt the couple take the logically route of kidnapping a baby from a wealthy couple who have just had quintuplets. But their actions get complicated by two escaped convicted, a police investigation and a ruthless bounty hunter. Raising Arizona is a very funny comedy that zips along at a great pace. The Coens' fingerprints are all over this film, having a sharply written script and excellent direction throughout. The jokes are constant throughout the film, giving us a variety of style of humour, from great one-liners, character interactions and pure physical comedy. The Coens bring a lot of energy to the film as we get over the top set pieces like the robbery where Ed abandons Hi and the Coens being a brings a kinetic style with their camera movements and editing of set pieces. We get a great prologue at the beginning of the film as we find out about Hi and Ed's past and how they came to their solution with funny jokes on the way. As well as the direction, Raising Arizona is blessed with a top cast who give both comic and sincere performances. Cage and Hunter had great chemistry together, having excellent comic time and were committed to their roles. Cage worked well with his supporting cast as they assemble a top cast: John Goodman being a particular highlight as one of the escaped prisoners. The Coens Brothers' direction is frantic through the film, using fast paced editing, hand-held cameras and tracking shots, amplifying the comedy, showing this maniac universe and gives Raising Arizona a distinctive visual style. The Coen's regular composer Carter Burwell also supplies a great score for the film, particular the use of a country/folk like guitar score which was a perfect fit for the film. Raising Arizona is a very entertaining, funny and heartfelt comedy that can stand along some of the best works the Coen Brothers have had to offer. It is a screwball comedy that can cater to many tests from intelligent jokes, observations and character interactions, to more over the top physical and visual comedy.

    Honestly, I did not expect even the first Cohen brothers films to be really good. This one definitely is worth watching because the seriousness with which Cohen brothers make frivolous movies is best and this time. Busy throughout the film to make the foreground absurd or to the characters or to the situations in which they fall in, the two filmmakers get us into the world of attracting of opposites. Line from the movie, which can serve as an example here would be: "If a frog had wings, it would hardly hitting the legs into the body when jumping." In equally absurd way arises the love between a young policewoman and obsessive in robberies of shops criminal (collection of fools, as they point themselves). As she turns frigid, they decide to steal a child from a newly born five twins. And thus began the mess that does not stop until the end. The film is ideal for detente and kicking a bad mood and driving a good one.

    Raising Arizona is easily one of the funniest,greatest and most original Comedies of all time and a timeless film classic. Filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a wonderful screenplay,truly beautiful cinematography and an unforgettable score,Raising Arizona is The Coen Brothers at their best and greatest. Raising Arizona tells the story of H.I. McDunnough(Nicholas Cage),a criminal and repeat offender and police officer 'Ed' Edwina(Holly Hunter)who fall in love and after falling in love decide to get married and have kids. When H.I. and Ed can't conceive kids of their own,H.I and Ed kidnap a quintuplet,Nathan Arizona JR(T.J Kuhn JR) one of the children of local business man Nathan Arizona(Trey Wilson). When H.I and Ed take Nathan J.r and want to raise him as their own wild and hilarious things happen in their lives. Raising Arizona is one of the all-time great classic Comedies from The Coen Brothers that came after their amazing film debut Blood Simple. When filmmakers have a first film that is so acclaimed and well loved, most filmmakers have to do a second film that lives up to the quality of their first film and not only does Raising Arizona live up to Blood Simple but also gives viewers and brilliant and much lighter cinematic experience. One of the reasons Raising Arizona is excellent and truly hilarious is because The Coen Brothers have given us a flawless film that combines great laughs with style and substance where everything in the film is over the top and exaggerated to the point of going over the top beyond belief. The laughs and humor in the film are funny,ingenious and original with hilarious Slapstick Comedy,funny dialog and moments in the movie that have you laughing until your stomach hurts and will have tears running down your face. The laughs are so crazy and over the top you will you're watching a surreal live Action Cartoon. What is also great about the Humor in this film and other Coen Brother films is that the laughs are subtle and used in visuals and imagery that are not obvious the first time you watch RA but when you watch the film with multiple viewings you will notice or catch some of the visual jokes of the film. And speaking of of visuals RA is one of the most beautiful and visually stunning Comedies I have ever seen. Barry Sonnefield's photography is amazing and powerful with wide angle shots,close ups and shots of the sunlight,road and dusty world of Arizona. Sonnefield's photography gives the film a surreal and wild energy that you don't see in most comedies and that is one of the great things that set RZ apart from other films of it's type because RA can have wonderful style but also a great substance. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is hilarious and well and one of the best screenplays in Comedy history with the Coens giving the main great dialog that is funny,memorable and stylized as well as greatly using narration for H.I. McDunnough and lines from the main characters that are quotable and will stay in your mind. The two main characters H.I. and Ed McDunnough while over the top and are cartoon characters who are funny but are given great depth and humanity and you feel like the two truly love and care for one another and even though H.I and Ed kidnapped a baby they don't do for fame or money,they do it because they want to be parents and want to love a child and the kidnapping make the main characters more complex than they truly are and that is one of things that great about RA and the Coens. Although not an Action film RA has a couple of good Action and chase scenes that are thrilling and exciting. Especially the film's main chase scene which is one of the funniest,wildest,original and over the top chase scenes in film history and it is a classic chase that that you will never forget. The ending of the film is funny,beautiful and very optimistic and will make you wonder what will happen to H.I and ED. An great ending to a great film. The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Nicholas Cage is brilliant,funny and at his best as H.I McDunnough,with Cage bringing laughs and depth to the role. Holly Hunter is excellent as 'Ed' Edwina McDunnough,with Hunter feisty and funny and having great chemistry with Cage. Trey Wilson is wonderful and fun as Nathan Arizona,a local business man. John Goodman and William Forsythe are great,funny and over the top as Gale and Evelle Snoats,escaped convicts who are H.I's friends. Sam McMurray and Francis McDormand are amazing and hilarious as husband and wife Glen and Dot,friends of H.I. and Ed. Randell 'Tex' Cobb is fantastic as Leonard Smalls,a man hunter who's a man of few words and is looking for Nathan JR. The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is excellent,with The Coens always moving the camera,using wide angles,low angles,close-ups and giving the film a great visual style. Great direction by The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is is amazing,funny,beautiful and very quirky and matches the tone of the film,with Burwell greatly mixing whistles,yodeling,organs and banjos. Wonderful score by Burwell. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you check out Raising Arizona,a truly hilarious,funny and unforgettable Comedy and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I adore this one. I'll have you know it is my 'feelgood' movie, having seen it now a dozen times it never fails to lift my spirits. After some deliberation, I am finally putting it on my list of must see films. What the Coens have done here is a very delicate thing. The obvious first. What you see in the film is both 'real', a loving trailer trash couple cannot conceive a child, and sleepless bending of reality as the urge to steal one so they can finally have a 'full family unit' manifests around them in all sorts of crazy situations. The biker from Hell is the tip of the thread, first dreamed about and in a weird confluence of forces soon appears in reality as dreamed. From that point on, everything is askew while pointing to anxious dreaming. Prison pals from HI's criminal past show up in the middle of the night. The frantic hunt for Huggies, starting with another botched holdup. HI's boss as the dreary dead-end of family life. More obvious, the business with the hole in the ground. It isn't simply surreal, a term normally associated with vaguely weird stream-of-consciousness. It's film noir, the film is sandwiched after all between the much more openly noirish Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. The Coens get noir, where the desire for life to be other/better than it is (not for sex or money as in noir, but blissful family life here personified in the baby) causes peculiar whims in perception, and those whims mysteriously manifest in the narrator's 'choosing' of the reality he remembers, collapsing in the process. Noir is magical, alluring to this day, because all those things are causally inextricable, desire from dream or memory from mysterious happenings in the story, which is why we often collapse the whole knotted mess to the workings of some celestial fate. There's all sorts of stuff woven on top. Reagan's morning in America as neurotic hyper-normalcy, the bum HI as the flipside of that, laid-back and tied to the American tradition of glorified frontiersmen and criminals, lampooned in the biker. 1980's suburbia as consumerist limbo. It's a helluva ride. Next to Blue Velvet and Society, the definitive 1980's film. It does all sort of collapse together by the end, which supports and enhances the idea of the random , whimsical arising of dreams. Big Lebowski starts here. Its charm? You can 'get' this without 'getting' it. The whole Huggies sequence is as profound to me as any cinematic dream. But it isn't like Tarkovksy who bypasses the mind by long mystifying sweeps, hitting deep in this way. It strikes an amazing balance between self-conscious intelligent conception and the bypass in spontaneous asides of fun and tremendous heartHI and Ed (the lovely Holly Hunter) are one of the most loving couples in filmdom. Intelligence, fun and emotion, these three are inextricable. This being so, you can 'get' the film via any route. It ends with an Ozzie and Harriet movie dream of the perfect life.

    Criminal Herbert I. "Hi" (Nicolas Cage) after his continued visits to a prison happens to marry Edwina "Ed" after his latest release from prison. Soon the couple discovers that Ed is not fit to be a mother and are unable to adopt a baby due to Ed's Criminal record. So they decide to kidnap one of the Quints of a local furniture magnate "Nathan Arizona" believing it to be Nathan Jr. Problems arouse as Hi is visited by his prison buddies and he thinks of returning to his notorious lifestyle along with his supervisor discovering that kid is not his after he made an unsuccessful wife swapping offer to him. Matters get worse as a bounty hunter named Leo Smalls gets in search of Nathan Jr. to sell him in the market and Hi's buddies taking undue advantage of junior's identity. Do watch this early Coen Bros. movie because of some great comic scenes especially the scene where Hi steals a pack of diapers and it is one of those movies that gives us the insight into the kind of characters the duo generates, dialogues they write and unconventional music score that became symbolic for their future movies. MY RATING: 9/10

    The film Raising Arizona begins with the unfortunate life of H.I. McDunnough (Nicholas Cage) and his journeys in and out of prison where he meets his future wife, Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter), a corrections officer. The two get married and discover that they cannot have children of their own, despite their beliefs that they are good people and would make great parents. Around that time, Nathan and Florence Arizona (Trey Wilson and Lynne Kitei) give birth to quintuplets, and discover that so many children are "more than they can handle!" The McDunnoughs, with their good intentions in hand, kidnap one of the quintuplets to raise as their own, believing that they are doing the Arizona's a favor. The primary theme of this film is the effects of karma, or the idea that "what goes around comes around." This theme can be found throughout the film, as characters like Gale and Evelle Snoats (John Goodman and William Forsythe) fail in their attempt to rob a bank and eventually return to jail. The theme can also be found through the consequences that the McDunnoughs face as a result of the kidnapping, and the reactions of Nathan Arizona when he finally learns what has happened to his son. The primary tool used to explain the theme of the film is the voice-over. A voice-over can be used to fill in gaps and make a film cohesive, or to explain background or contextual information to the viewer (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). In Raising Arizona, the voice-over is used for both reasons, and gives thorough insights into the thoughts and motives of the characters. This tool is very effective in conveying the theme of the film in that sense. The acting throughout the film is also very effective in helping to convey the theme of the film. H.I. is a very innocent character, despite his many crimes, and the acting portrays this well. Ed is another na&iuml;ve character, who does not fully understand the consequences of her actions. As both of these characters begin to realize the consequences of their actions, they begin to take responsibility for them and try to do what is best for everyone. In that sense, both actors help to contribute to the theme of the film by effectively displaying the emotions and motivations of their characters. The theme of this film is similar to the themes of many other films, like, for example, the film Elf, where the primary character, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell), acts on his good intentions, even when his actions may not be the right thing to do. For example, in one scene, Buddy gets in a fight with a store "Santa" (Artie Lange) because Buddy knows that the man is an imposter. The message of this film is very important to everyone, because good intentions are very important, but it is still important that one always tries to do what is right. Though they may have started off on the wrong path, Ed and H.I. finally make amends and do what is right for everyone involved in the situation. References Boggs, J. M. & Petrie, D. W. (2008).

    Raising Arizona is a film that follows the story of an unconventional couple; convict Hi (Cage) and police officer Ed (Hunter), as they attempt to find harmony and happiness in their lives together. However, their greatest obstacle is Ed's sterility that slowly wears on their relationship and threatens their sanity until opportunity arises in the form of a wealthy local whose wife births "more than she can handle". Accomplishing the abduction proves a bit difficult, but the rabid persistence of Ed drives their mission to success, and with the addition of this vital piece, it seems a true family is born. Unfortunately, prying and obnoxious colleagues, mischievous jailbirds/buddies, and a gritty detective with a Harley threaten their happiness, but also demonstrate how misguided and selfish their actions have been. Returning the baby to an appreciative and surprisingly sympathetic father, Hi reflects on the affection we have for children, even if they're not our own and is able to sleep peacefully with dreams for the future that he hopes holds a family of his very own. I generally appreciate the Coen Brother's films and what I appreciate most is their ability to hold interest of the audience through plot twists and strong characters; there's nothing extreme or very showy about their work and yet it stands out because there is only ever and illusion of normalcy and sanity in their characters or the plot, really the work is quite complex but we appreciate it more because they make no pretense. Raising Arizona continues this tradition and also has quite a flavor of Americana, enhanced greatly by the colorful characters. The humor was ludicrous most times, but it was balanced through the sensitive and reflective nature of the protagonist, whose broodings lend itself to the underlying sense of loneliness and hopelessness of the characters and the landscape and drive the rich plot forward. I feel that any criticism would simply be void for two reasons: I believe that this film is very stylistic and I don't believe that they ventured out of this particular structure, any risk they took (including the dream sequences) had basis in reality and only served to give the film more poetic flavor, and secondly, I believe that the film was unique and heartfelt among it's genre, which at times is difficult to achieve in something externally so seemingly detached as comedy, and mainly, I think there was valid reasoning behind it's creation, which is my only objection with modern film. The cinematography of the film was very interesting and was able to keep the audience occupied by the sheer amount of stimulation the wild camera movements brought. I was able to appreciate the shaky camera work simply because I think it does justice to Hi's convict past as well as his current lifestyle, punctuated by his most daring criminal offense yet. This apparently dramatic and brutal world is something that few of us can sympathize with and I think the long takes through several different environments contributes to that foreign aspect of the film that quite frankly makes it hilarious. Motifs in the film include the joined hands of Hi and Ed, representing their bond and their support of each other, the fire that erupts from the detective, representing his nature, and the convenient store that represents Hi's temptation or the pull of his old life. The brothers use this as well as a few non-diegetic inserts (including baby toys) to bring a bit of understanding to the rapidly moving plot, but it is interesting to note that this veers a bit from the slapstick genre that is quite shallow and brings a poetic aspect to the film. In the abduction scene the use of high-angle and low-angle shots capture flawlessly both the perspective of Hi and of the babies and the power shift that takes place between them, succeeding in making Hi seem vulnerable among these small creatures. Also, throughout the entire film the use of the wide-angle lens is used, making people and surroundings seem distorted and often a bit out of proportion. The abduction scene demonstrates the use of this very well, especially when the babies are taking a very long time to reach the door and then the end of the hallway, giving Hi enough time to catch them before Mrs. Arizona discovers. This also contributes to the suspense of the scene, because everything seems to take longer to happen and Hi is running out of time to act. Off-screen action and voice is used quite a bit to stage a change in events in the plot and repetition of certain events forming a montage is comedic as well as clarity inducing. It really strikes both emotional stances quite well and makes for a heartfelt and poetic take on the slapstick comedy genre, aided by the strong narrative voice that guides us through a ridiculous and tragic journey of an unlikely couple trying to find the missing piece in their family.

    A quick checklist for anyone considering this movie: 1. Coenheads - if you are one, proceed to checkout 2. Hollow humorist - if you like to be force fed your humor, you're in luck. 3. Bicoastalism - plenty of middle/Southern/Western stereotypes here 4. Amateur Auteurs - Watch this film so you can earn your "I'm-more- sophisticated-than-you" pin. All others should bypass this cinematic desert. It has been said that much art is devised to impress other artists. I think that attitude is central to Coeney Island, and this film certainly falls into the category euphemistically called "quirky". Products such as this can't be blamed for aiming squarely at their intended audience. If you like this kind of pseudo-intellectual fare, bully for you. There are plenty of vendors for this kind of ware. All others who will try to find anything substantial will be sorely disappointed. You won't experience wildness, depth, sentiment, wonder, fury, intrigue, edginess, insight, lasciviousness, or even a good joke. In fact, what's really missing is honesty. You will be served up mounds of pretense and self-important contrivance, infused with long-expired sophomorism, and powdered with clip art humanism. Package above with ,uh, quirky dialogue (hard to assign that term since the characters don't express anything to each other or the audience) and you have all the haughty form-over-substance. cookie-cutter originality that the anesthetized soul craves. It was finely-crafted bubble-wrap, I admit that.

    Raising Arizona is a not-so-funny comedy surrounding the marriage and infertility of ex-cop, Ed McDonnough (Holly Hunter) and her ex-con husband, H.I. (Nicolas Cage). When the couple is told by her doctor that they would not be able to conceive a child of their own, Ed is devastated. While watching television one evening, the couple sees that Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), a rich, furniture store owner and his wife were now the proud parents of quintuplets. Ed concocts a plan to "borrow" one of their babies because she believes they "have their hands full" with 5 babies. This in turn sets off a crazy string of events which leave the couple in a fight for their "borrowed" child, their freedom and their love for one another. The theme of Raising Arizona is a character's struggle within themselves to soothe the constant "wants" in life that are not necessarily needed. Throughout the movie, Ed just wants to be happy. Before marrying H.I., she just wanted to meet the right man and get married. During one scene when Ed is booking H.I. into one of his many jail stints, she is sobbing because her then fianc&eacute;' had broken up with her. This was the first time that Ed realized that she had feelings for H.I., when he showed compassion for her and told her that her fianc&eacute;' had to be stupid to leave her. Soon after, Ed and H.I. were married and she immediately wanted to start having babies. This proved to be impossible for them and her desperate "want" to be a mother caused her to grow depressed, lose interest in everything - including cleaning her house and she lost her job. H.I. just seems to be along for the crazy ride. The wild story line and almost unfathomable shenanigans in this movie are somewhat similar to the 1990 Dennis Dugan movie, Problem Child, starring John Ritter. In both movies, there are couples who desperately want to have a child and when they are both given what they want it proves to be much more than they can handle. Both movies are filled with conflict and chaos right up to the very end. The motifs and camera angles brought out the theme of this movie and made it more exciting to watch. Throughout the movie the viewer is constantly reminded that Ed wants a baby and after Baby Arizona is "borrowed", the camera is fixated on how Ed and H.I. plan to keep him and keep their secret. The camera techniques were great in this movie. There were several parallel cuts that took the viewer back and forth between two different locations as the suspense was rising. In one particular scene, Ed, H.I. and Baby Jr. are driving home from spending a day with friends and they pull into a store to pick up some diapers. H.I. is tempted to resort to his old ways and ends up robbing the store. Ed sees him through the window and immediately becomes angry and drives away, leaving him to fend for himself. What H.I. doesn't anticipate though, is the store clerk is ready for him. After pushing an emergency button to alert the authorities, the clerk pulls out a rifle and starts shooting at H.I. Just as he is running away the cops pull up and start a wild chase. The cameras cut back and forth between H.I. running through streets, yards and houses, the cops chasing him and Ed, who had a change of heart about leaving him and decides to go back and try to help save him from the police. All of the chaos and goofy humor combined with a crazy plot take the viewer right back to the theme of the movie, choose your "wants" lightly because they just might turn out to be your "want nots".

    You've gotta hand it to the Coen brothers, they sure know how to inject style and flamboyance in their creations. And to think that "Raising Arizona" was only their second feature film makes the accomplishment even more impressive although "Blood Simple." was powerful enough an announcement of two upcoming talents threatening to shake Hollywood's conventions with a unique sense of eccentricity, and human depth. "Blood Simple." was still borrowing some elements from film-noir and Hitchcock movies, and, no matter how effective it was, it could have easily been targeted as an exercise in style. This is why the Coen brothers couldn't have made a better choice by making a zany comedy with a tender and more optimistic tone. And not only the film works but "Raising Arizona" is now a comedy classic, so special that it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath than 80's comedies for the simple reason that it differs from what was made in that decade. And that's the thing about the Coen brothers, they make timeless films, set in universes, playing like crossroads between fantasy and reality, where their stories float with a bizarre but so penetrating poetry. I know this is a Coen brothers' so we're tempted to get deeper on the subject. Granted it's not just a story about two people who kidnap a baby because they can't have one, there are far more symbolism and philosophical material lying underneath the screwball carapace, but how about enjoying the film for what it is: one hilarious piece of cinematic greatness carried by the kind of colorful cast that made the Coen's films so lively. And what a cast! Nicolas Cage is H.I. aka "Hi" McDunnough, a multiple recidivist specialized in robbing market stores and Holly Hunter is Edwina aka 'Ed', the photographer who took so many mug shots she ended up proving that indeed, opposites attracted. But the Coen brothers are not the type of directors to comfortably sit on the presence of two solid protagonist, they know supporting characters are the spices that give the film its flavor. So, we have the two escaped prison buddies, two brothers played by two Johns, John Goodman, who'd become one of the Coen's greatest asset with such a physical presence he'd steal the show anytime, anywhere and Forsythe as his dim-witted brother. There is Sam McMumurray as Glen, the bourgeois pain-in-the-ass and the late Trey Wilson as Nathan Arizona, father of cute blonde-haired quints, the furniture magnate whose motto consist on concluding all his statements with "or my name isn't Nathan Arizona". Each character illuminates the screen with a unique presence, even little Nathan Jr. makes you believe people would kill each other to get him, and Frances McDormand is given a less important play but plays it with the required over-the-top way you'd expect from the woman who chose a guy like Glen for husband. Speaking of Glen, nothing against Sam McMurray but I would have loved to see John Turturro playing his part, if only because it would have made "Raising Arizona"'s the consummate Coen brothers' film, with characters before stories. Hell, it goes even to the point where the most seemingly inoffensive market-cashier can tot a gunshot and become a Dirty Harry-like figure, no one is to be underestimated, not when laughs are at stakes. Naturally, such story deserves a worthy villain and this is where Randal 'Tex' Cobb makes his entrances, as a man coming from nowhere, supposedly incarnating the devil, whenever he goes, grass never grow back and this modern Atilla of biker of the apocalypse first emerges in HI's dream after he stole Nathan's kid. He symbolizes HI's conscience, something that will torment him until he finds the way to redeem himself, and this is the philosophical stuff hidden beneath the film, it's about characters doing morally wrong things, and finding their own path to redemption. When a recidivist teams up with a cop and both stole parents' fruits of love, you know this ain't the way to reach marital happiness. And the whole narrative is cooked up up in typical Mid-West accent, flirting with caricature but giving "Raising Arizona"its colorful spirit, the same as "Fargo" with its overuse of Scandinavian accent made of "Yah" and "You betcha". This is the Coens' signature and it doesn't limit to dialogs but goes to the soundtrack and from the title to the score, you have the hillbilly thing screaming all over the place. Till today, it's impossible not to hear "Raising Arizona" without having that fast-paced upbeat banjo music and catchy yodel that makes you want to escape from whatever makes your routine. You got it, "Raising Arizona" is pure entertaining escapism, with a man and a woman giving their life a meaning the wrong way, before learning the lessons, the hard way. And what a lesson! the conclusion of the film is probably the most insightful and beautiful thing ever put in a film, transcending the limits of comedies to something that cuts straight to your heart. And by the way, I couldn't believe Roger Ebert's review, my only guess he didn't have enough perspective and he probably changed his mind after. But thanks to Ebert, I learned the definition of a good movie, from Howard Hawks' quote. It's made of three good scenes and no bad scenes. There are none in "Raising Arizona" and there are three mesmerizing sequences: one of the most promising and funny introductions ever, then the market scene that reinvents the foot-chase forever, and made it deeply intertwined with hillbilly yodel like banjo music did for "Bonnie and Clyde", and ten you have one of the most poignant and meaningful monologues ever. There are three great moments in "Raising Arizona", in the beginning, the middle and the ending, and if only for these moments, with so many laughs in-between, "Raising Arizona" is one of the greatest comedies ever  or my IMDb user name isn't ElMaruecan82.

    The Coen Brothers have made many great films and worked in many different genres. One of their most famous comedies is Raising Arizona, a fast paced, zany comedy that can only come from the minds of the Coens. H.I. "Hi" McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) is a career criminal who falls for policewoman Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter) and goes straight for her. After they get married they attempt to have a child, but when Ed finds out she is infertile and the pair unable to adopt the couple take the logically route of kidnapping a baby from a wealthy couple who have just had quintuplets. But their actions get complicated by two escaped convicted, a police investigation and a ruthless bounty hunter. Raising Arizona is a very funny comedy that zips along at a great pace. The Coens' fingerprints are all over this film, having a sharply written script and excellent direction throughout. The jokes are constant throughout the film, giving us a variety of style of humour, from great one-liners, character interactions and pure physical comedy. The Coens bring a lot of energy to the film as we get over the top set pieces like the robbery where Ed abandons Hi and the Coens being a brings a kinetic style with their camera movements and editing of set pieces. We get a great prologue at the beginning of the film as we find out about Hi and Ed's past and how they came to their solution with funny jokes on the way. As well as the direction, Raising Arizona is blessed with a top cast who give both comic and sincere performances. Cage and Hunter had great chemistry together, having excellent comic time and were committed to their roles. Cage worked well with his supporting cast as they assemble a top cast: John Goodman being a particular highlight as one of the escaped prisoners. The Coens Brothers' direction is frantic through the film, using fast paced editing, hand-held cameras and tracking shots, amplifying the comedy, showing this maniac universe and gives Raising Arizona a distinctive visual style. The Coen's regular composer Carter Burwell also supplies a great score for the film, particular the use of a country/folk like guitar score which was a perfect fit for the film. Raising Arizona is a very entertaining, funny and heartfelt comedy that can stand along some of the best works the Coen Brothers have had to offer. It is a screwball comedy that can cater to many tests from intelligent jokes, observations and character interactions, to more over the top physical and visual comedy.

    Honestly, I did not expect even the first Cohen brothers films to be really good. This one definitely is worth watching because the seriousness with which Cohen brothers make frivolous movies is best and this time. Busy throughout the film to make the foreground absurd or to the characters or to the situations in which they fall in, the two filmmakers get us into the world of attracting of opposites. Line from the movie, which can serve as an example here would be: "If a frog had wings, it would hardly hitting the legs into the body when jumping." In equally absurd way arises the love between a young policewoman and obsessive in robberies of shops criminal (collection of fools, as they point themselves). As she turns frigid, they decide to steal a child from a newly born five twins. And thus began the mess that does not stop until the end. The film is ideal for detente and kicking a bad mood and driving a good one.

    Raising Arizona is easily one of the funniest,greatest and most original Comedies of all time and a timeless film classic. Filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a wonderful screenplay,truly beautiful cinematography and an unforgettable score,Raising Arizona is The Coen Brothers at their best and greatest. Raising Arizona tells the story of H.I. McDunnough(Nicholas Cage),a criminal and repeat offender and police officer 'Ed' Edwina(Holly Hunter)who fall in love and after falling in love decide to get married and have kids. When H.I. and Ed can't conceive kids of their own,H.I and Ed kidnap a quintuplet,Nathan Arizona JR(T.J Kuhn JR) one of the children of local business man Nathan Arizona(Trey Wilson). When H.I and Ed take Nathan J.r and want to raise him as their own wild and hilarious things happen in their lives. Raising Arizona is one of the all-time great classic Comedies from The Coen Brothers that came after their amazing film debut Blood Simple. When filmmakers have a first film that is so acclaimed and well loved, most filmmakers have to do a second film that lives up to the quality of their first film and not only does Raising Arizona live up to Blood Simple but also gives viewers and brilliant and much lighter cinematic experience. One of the reasons Raising Arizona is excellent and truly hilarious is because The Coen Brothers have given us a flawless film that combines great laughs with style and substance where everything in the film is over the top and exaggerated to the point of going over the top beyond belief. The laughs and humor in the film are funny,ingenious and original with hilarious Slapstick Comedy,funny dialog and moments in the movie that have you laughing until your stomach hurts and will have tears running down your face. The laughs are so crazy and over the top you will you're watching a surreal live Action Cartoon. What is also great about the Humor in this film and other Coen Brother films is that the laughs are subtle and used in visuals and imagery that are not obvious the first time you watch RA but when you watch the film with multiple viewings you will notice or catch some of the visual jokes of the film. And speaking of of visuals RA is one of the most beautiful and visually stunning Comedies I have ever seen. Barry Sonnefield's photography is amazing and powerful with wide angle shots,close ups and shots of the sunlight,road and dusty world of Arizona. Sonnefield's photography gives the film a surreal and wild energy that you don't see in most comedies and that is one of the great things that set RZ apart from other films of it's type because RA can have wonderful style but also a great substance. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is hilarious and well and one of the best screenplays in Comedy history with the Coens giving the main great dialog that is funny,memorable and stylized as well as greatly using narration for H.I. McDunnough and lines from the main characters that are quotable and will stay in your mind. The two main characters H.I. and Ed McDunnough while over the top and are cartoon characters who are funny but are given great depth and humanity and you feel like the two truly love and care for one another and even though H.I and Ed kidnapped a baby they don't do for fame or money,they do it because they want to be parents and want to love a child and the kidnapping make the main characters more complex than they truly are and that is one of things that great about RA and the Coens. Although not an Action film RA has a couple of good Action and chase scenes that are thrilling and exciting. Especially the film's main chase scene which is one of the funniest,wildest,original and over the top chase scenes in film history and it is a classic chase that that you will never forget. The ending of the film is funny,beautiful and very optimistic and will make you wonder what will happen to H.I and ED. An great ending to a great film. The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Nicholas Cage is brilliant,funny and at his best as H.I McDunnough,with Cage bringing laughs and depth to the role. Holly Hunter is excellent as 'Ed' Edwina McDunnough,with Hunter feisty and funny and having great chemistry with Cage. Trey Wilson is wonderful and fun as Nathan Arizona,a local business man. John Goodman and William Forsythe are great,funny and over the top as Gale and Evelle Snoats,escaped convicts who are H.I's friends. Sam McMurray and Francis McDormand are amazing and hilarious as husband and wife Glen and Dot,friends of H.I. and Ed. Randell 'Tex' Cobb is fantastic as Leonard Smalls,a man hunter who's a man of few words and is looking for Nathan JR. The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is excellent,with The Coens always moving the camera,using wide angles,low angles,close-ups and giving the film a great visual style. Great direction by The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is is amazing,funny,beautiful and very quirky and matches the tone of the film,with Burwell greatly mixing whistles,yodeling,organs and banjos. Wonderful score by Burwell. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you check out Raising Arizona,a truly hilarious,funny and unforgettable Comedy and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I adore this one. I'll have you know it is my 'feelgood' movie, having seen it now a dozen times it never fails to lift my spirits. After some deliberation, I am finally putting it on my list of must see films. What the Coens have done here is a very delicate thing. The obvious first. What you see in the film is both 'real', a loving trailer trash couple cannot conceive a child, and sleepless bending of reality as the urge to steal one so they can finally have a 'full family unit' manifests around them in all sorts of crazy situations. The biker from Hell is the tip of the thread, first dreamed about and in a weird confluence of forces soon appears in reality as dreamed. From that point on, everything is askew while pointing to anxious dreaming. Prison pals from HI's criminal past show up in the middle of the night. The frantic hunt for Huggies, starting with another botched holdup. HI's boss as the dreary dead-end of family life. More obvious, the business with the hole in the ground. It isn't simply surreal, a term normally associated with vaguely weird stream-of-consciousness. It's film noir, the film is sandwiched after all between the much more openly noirish Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. The Coens get noir, where the desire for life to be other/better than it is (not for sex or money as in noir, but blissful family life here personified in the baby) causes peculiar whims in perception, and those whims mysteriously manifest in the narrator's 'choosing' of the reality he remembers, collapsing in the process. Noir is magical, alluring to this day, because all those things are causally inextricable, desire from dream or memory from mysterious happenings in the story, which is why we often collapse the whole knotted mess to the workings of some celestial fate. There's all sorts of stuff woven on top. Reagan's morning in America as neurotic hyper-normalcy, the bum HI as the flipside of that, laid-back and tied to the American tradition of glorified frontiersmen and criminals, lampooned in the biker. 1980's suburbia as consumerist limbo. It's a helluva ride. Next to Blue Velvet and Society, the definitive 1980's film. It does all sort of collapse together by the end, which supports and enhances the idea of the random , whimsical arising of dreams. Big Lebowski starts here. Its charm? You can 'get' this without 'getting' it. The whole Huggies sequence is as profound to me as any cinematic dream. But it isn't like Tarkovksy who bypasses the mind by long mystifying sweeps, hitting deep in this way. It strikes an amazing balance between self-conscious intelligent conception and the bypass in spontaneous asides of fun and tremendous heartHI and Ed (the lovely Holly Hunter) are one of the most loving couples in filmdom. Intelligence, fun and emotion, these three are inextricable. This being so, you can 'get' the film via any route. It ends with an Ozzie and Harriet movie dream of the perfect life.

    Criminal Herbert I. "Hi" (Nicolas Cage) after his continued visits to a prison happens to marry Edwina "Ed" after his latest release from prison. Soon the couple discovers that Ed is not fit to be a mother and are unable to adopt a baby due to Ed's Criminal record. So they decide to kidnap one of the Quints of a local furniture magnate "Nathan Arizona" believing it to be Nathan Jr. Problems arouse as Hi is visited by his prison buddies and he thinks of returning to his notorious lifestyle along with his supervisor discovering that kid is not his after he made an unsuccessful wife swapping offer to him. Matters get worse as a bounty hunter named Leo Smalls gets in search of Nathan Jr. to sell him in the market and Hi's buddies taking undue advantage of junior's identity. Do watch this early Coen Bros. movie because of some great comic scenes especially the scene where Hi steals a pack of diapers and it is one of those movies that gives us the insight into the kind of characters the duo generates, dialogues they write and unconventional music score that became symbolic for their future movies. MY RATING: 9/10

    The film Raising Arizona begins with the unfortunate life of H.I. McDunnough (Nicholas Cage) and his journeys in and out of prison where he meets his future wife, Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter), a corrections officer. The two get married and discover that they cannot have children of their own, despite their beliefs that they are good people and would make great parents. Around that time, Nathan and Florence Arizona (Trey Wilson and Lynne Kitei) give birth to quintuplets, and discover that so many children are "more than they can handle!" The McDunnoughs, with their good intentions in hand, kidnap one of the quintuplets to raise as their own, believing that they are doing the Arizona's a favor. The primary theme of this film is the effects of karma, or the idea that "what goes around comes around." This theme can be found throughout the film, as characters like Gale and Evelle Snoats (John Goodman and William Forsythe) fail in their attempt to rob a bank and eventually return to jail. The theme can also be found through the consequences that the McDunnoughs face as a result of the kidnapping, and the reactions of Nathan Arizona when he finally learns what has happened to his son. The primary tool used to explain the theme of the film is the voice-over. A voice-over can be used to fill in gaps and make a film cohesive, or to explain background or contextual information to the viewer (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). In Raising Arizona, the voice-over is used for both reasons, and gives thorough insights into the thoughts and motives of the characters. This tool is very effective in conveying the theme of the film in that sense. The acting throughout the film is also very effective in helping to convey the theme of the film. H.I. is a very innocent character, despite his many crimes, and the acting portrays this well. Ed is another na&iuml;ve character, who does not fully understand the consequences of her actions. As both of these characters begin to realize the consequences of their actions, they begin to take responsibility for them and try to do what is best for everyone. In that sense, both actors help to contribute to the theme of the film by effectively displaying the emotions and motivations of their characters. The theme of this film is similar to the themes of many other films, like, for example, the film Elf, where the primary character, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell), acts on his good intentions, even when his actions may not be the right thing to do. For example, in one scene, Buddy gets in a fight with a store "Santa" (Artie Lange) because Buddy knows that the man is an imposter. The message of this film is very important to everyone, because good intentions are very important, but it is still important that one always tries to do what is right. Though they may have started off on the wrong path, Ed and H.I. finally make amends and do what is right for everyone involved in the situation. References Boggs, J. M. & Petrie, D. W. (2008).

    Raising Arizona is a film that follows the story of an unconventional couple; convict Hi (Cage) and police officer Ed (Hunter), as they attempt to find harmony and happiness in their lives together. However, their greatest obstacle is Ed's sterility that slowly wears on their relationship and threatens their sanity until opportunity arises in the form of a wealthy local whose wife births "more than she can handle". Accomplishing the abduction proves a bit difficult, but the rabid persistence of Ed drives their mission to success, and with the addition of this vital piece, it seems a true family is born. Unfortunately, prying and obnoxious colleagues, mischievous jailbirds/buddies, and a gritty detective with a Harley threaten their happiness, but also demonstrate how misguided and selfish their actions have been. Returning the baby to an appreciative and surprisingly sympathetic father, Hi reflects on the affection we have for children, even if they're not our own and is able to sleep peacefully with dreams for the future that he hopes holds a family of his very own. I generally appreciate the Coen Brother's films and what I appreciate most is their ability to hold interest of the audience through plot twists and strong characters; there's nothing extreme or very showy about their work and yet it stands out because there is only ever and illusion of normalcy and sanity in their characters or the plot, really the work is quite complex but we appreciate it more because they make no pretense. Raising Arizona continues this tradition and also has quite a flavor of Americana, enhanced greatly by the colorful characters. The humor was ludicrous most times, but it was balanced through the sensitive and reflective nature of the protagonist, whose broodings lend itself to the underlying sense of loneliness and hopelessness of the characters and the landscape and drive the rich plot forward. I feel that any criticism would simply be void for two reasons: I believe that this film is very stylistic and I don't believe that they ventured out of this particular structure, any risk they took (including the dream sequences) had basis in reality and only served to give the film more poetic flavor, and secondly, I believe that the film was unique and heartfelt among it's genre, which at times is difficult to achieve in something externally so seemingly detached as comedy, and mainly, I think there was valid reasoning behind it's creation, which is my only objection with modern film. The cinematography of the film was very interesting and was able to keep the audience occupied by the sheer amount of stimulation the wild camera movements brought. I was able to appreciate the shaky camera work simply because I think it does justice to Hi's convict past as well as his current lifestyle, punctuated by his most daring criminal offense yet. This apparently dramatic and brutal world is something that few of us can sympathize with and I think the long takes through several different environments contributes to that foreign aspect of the film that quite frankly makes it hilarious. Motifs in the film include the joined hands of Hi and Ed, representing their bond and their support of each other, the fire that erupts from the detective, representing his nature, and the convenient store that represents Hi's temptation or the pull of his old life. The brothers use this as well as a few non-diegetic inserts (including baby toys) to bring a bit of understanding to the rapidly moving plot, but it is interesting to note that this veers a bit from the slapstick genre that is quite shallow and brings a poetic aspect to the film. In the abduction scene the use of high-angle and low-angle shots capture flawlessly both the perspective of Hi and of the babies and the power shift that takes place between them, succeeding in making Hi seem vulnerable among these small creatures. Also, throughout the entire film the use of the wide-angle lens is used, making people and surroundings seem distorted and often a bit out of proportion. The abduction scene demonstrates the use of this very well, especially when the babies are taking a very long time to reach the door and then the end of the hallway, giving Hi enough time to catch them before Mrs. Arizona discovers. This also contributes to the suspense of the scene, because everything seems to take longer to happen and Hi is running out of time to act. Off-screen action and voice is used quite a bit to stage a change in events in the plot and repetition of certain events forming a montage is comedic as well as clarity inducing. It really strikes both emotional stances quite well and makes for a heartfelt and poetic take on the slapstick comedy genre, aided by the strong narrative voice that guides us through a ridiculous and tragic journey of an unlikely couple trying to find the missing piece in their family.

    A quick checklist for anyone considering this movie: 1. Coenheads - if you are one, proceed to checkout 2. Hollow humorist - if you like to be force fed your humor, you're in luck. 3. Bicoastalism - plenty of middle/Southern/Western stereotypes here 4. Amateur Auteurs - Watch this film so you can earn your "I'm-more- sophisticated-than-you" pin. All others should bypass this cinematic desert. It has been said that much art is devised to impress other artists. I think that attitude is central to Coeney Island, and this film certainly falls into the category euphemistically called "quirky". Products such as this can't be blamed for aiming squarely at their intended audience. If you like this kind of pseudo-intellectual fare, bully for you. There are plenty of vendors for this kind of ware. All others who will try to find anything substantial will be sorely disappointed. You won't experience wildness, depth, sentiment, wonder, fury, intrigue, edginess, insight, lasciviousness, or even a good joke. In fact, what's really missing is honesty. You will be served up mounds of pretense and self-important contrivance, infused with long-expired sophomorism, and powdered with clip art humanism. Package above with ,uh, quirky dialogue (hard to assign that term since the characters don't express anything to each other or the audience) and you have all the haughty form-over-substance. cookie-cutter originality that the anesthetized soul craves. It was finely-crafted bubble-wrap, I admit that.

    Raising Arizona is a not-so-funny comedy surrounding the marriage and infertility of ex-cop, Ed McDonnough (Holly Hunter) and her ex-con husband, H.I. (Nicolas Cage). When the couple is told by her doctor that they would not be able to conceive a child of their own, Ed is devastated. While watching television one evening, the couple sees that Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), a rich, furniture store owner and his wife were now the proud parents of quintuplets. Ed concocts a plan to "borrow" one of their babies because she believes they "have their hands full" with 5 babies. This in turn sets off a crazy string of events which leave the couple in a fight for their "borrowed" child, their freedom and their love for one another. The theme of Raising Arizona is a character's struggle within themselves to soothe the constant "wants" in life that are not necessarily needed. Throughout the movie, Ed just wants to be happy. Before marrying H.I., she just wanted to meet the right man and get married. During one scene when Ed is booking H.I. into one of his many jail stints, she is sobbing because her then fianc&eacute;' had broken up with her. This was the first time that Ed realized that she had feelings for H.I., when he showed compassion for her and told her that her fianc&eacute;' had to be stupid to leave her. Soon after, Ed and H.I. were married and she immediately wanted to start having babies. This proved to be impossible for them and her desperate "want" to be a mother caused her to grow depressed, lose interest in everything - including cleaning her house and she lost her job. H.I. just seems to be along for the crazy ride. The wild story line and almost unfathomable shenanigans in this movie are somewhat similar to the 1990 Dennis Dugan movie, Problem Child, starring John Ritter. In both movies, there are couples who desperately want to have a child and when they are both given what they want it proves to be much more than they can handle. Both movies are filled with conflict and chaos right up to the very end. The motifs and camera angles brought out the theme of this movie and made it more exciting to watch. Throughout the movie the viewer is constantly reminded that Ed wants a baby and after Baby Arizona is "borrowed", the camera is fixated on how Ed and H.I. plan to keep him and keep their secret. The camera techniques were great in this movie. There were several parallel cuts that took the viewer back and forth between two different locations as the suspense was rising. In one particular scene, Ed, H.I. and Baby Jr. are driving home from spending a day with friends and they pull into a store to pick up some diapers. H.I. is tempted to resort to his old ways and ends up robbing the store. Ed sees him through the window and immediately becomes angry and drives away, leaving him to fend for himself. What H.I. doesn't anticipate though, is the store clerk is ready for him. After pushing an emergency button to alert the authorities, the clerk pulls out a rifle and starts shooting at H.I. Just as he is running away the cops pull up and start a wild chase. The cameras cut back and forth between H.I. running through streets, yards and houses, the cops chasing him and Ed, who had a change of heart about leaving him and decides to go back and try to help save him from the police. All of the chaos and goofy humor combined with a crazy plot take the viewer right back to the theme of the movie, choose your "wants" lightly because they just might turn out to be your "want nots".

    You've gotta hand it to the Coen brothers, they sure know how to inject style and flamboyance in their creations. And to think that "Raising Arizona" was only their second feature film makes the accomplishment even more impressive although "Blood Simple." was powerful enough an announcement of two upcoming talents threatening to shake Hollywood's conventions with a unique sense of eccentricity, and human depth. "Blood Simple." was still borrowing some elements from film-noir and Hitchcock movies, and, no matter how effective it was, it could have easily been targeted as an exercise in style. This is why the Coen brothers couldn't have made a better choice by making a zany comedy with a tender and more optimistic tone. And not only the film works but "Raising Arizona" is now a comedy classic, so special that it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath than 80's comedies for the simple reason that it differs from what was made in that decade. And that's the thing about the Coen brothers, they make timeless films, set in universes, playing like crossroads between fantasy and reality, where their stories float with a bizarre but so penetrating poetry. I know this is a Coen brothers' so we're tempted to get deeper on the subject. Granted it's not just a story about two people who kidnap a baby because they can't have one, there are far more symbolism and philosophical material lying underneath the screwball carapace, but how about enjoying the film for what it is: one hilarious piece of cinematic greatness carried by the kind of colorful cast that made the Coen's films so lively. And what a cast! Nicolas Cage is H.I. aka "Hi" McDunnough, a multiple recidivist specialized in robbing market stores and Holly Hunter is Edwina aka 'Ed', the photographer who took so many mug shots she ended up proving that indeed, opposites attracted. But the Coen brothers are not the type of directors to comfortably sit on the presence of two solid protagonist, they know supporting characters are the spices that give the film its flavor. So, we have the two escaped prison buddies, two brothers played by two Johns, John Goodman, who'd become one of the Coen's greatest asset with such a physical presence he'd steal the show anytime, anywhere and Forsythe as his dim-witted brother. There is Sam McMumurray as Glen, the bourgeois pain-in-the-ass and the late Trey Wilson as Nathan Arizona, father of cute blonde-haired quints, the furniture magnate whose motto consist on concluding all his statements with "or my name isn't Nathan Arizona". Each character illuminates the screen with a unique presence, even little Nathan Jr. makes you believe people would kill each other to get him, and Frances McDormand is given a less important play but plays it with the required over-the-top way you'd expect from the woman who chose a guy like Glen for husband. Speaking of Glen, nothing against Sam McMurray but I would have loved to see John Turturro playing his part, if only because it would have made "Raising Arizona"'s the consummate Coen brothers' film, with characters before stories. Hell, it goes even to the point where the most seemingly inoffensive market-cashier can tot a gunshot and become a Dirty Harry-like figure, no one is to be underestimated, not when laughs are at stakes. Naturally, such story deserves a worthy villain and this is where Randal 'Tex' Cobb makes his entrances, as a man coming from nowhere, supposedly incarnating the devil, whenever he goes, grass never grow back and this modern Atilla of biker of the apocalypse first emerges in HI's dream after he stole Nathan's kid. He symbolizes HI's conscience, something that will torment him until he finds the way to redeem himself, and this is the philosophical stuff hidden beneath the film, it's about characters doing morally wrong things, and finding their own path to redemption. When a recidivist teams up with a cop and both stole parents' fruits of love, you know this ain't the way to reach marital happiness. And the whole narrative is cooked up up in typical Mid-West accent, flirting with caricature but giving "Raising Arizona"its colorful spirit, the same as "Fargo" with its overuse of Scandinavian accent made of "Yah" and "You betcha". This is the Coens' signature and it doesn't limit to dialogs but goes to the soundtrack and from the title to the score, you have the hillbilly thing screaming all over the place. Till today, it's impossible not to hear "Raising Arizona" without having that fast-paced upbeat banjo music and catchy yodel that makes you want to escape from whatever makes your routine. You got it, "Raising Arizona" is pure entertaining escapism, with a man and a woman giving their life a meaning the wrong way, before learning the lessons, the hard way. And what a lesson! the conclusion of the film is probably the most insightful and beautiful thing ever put in a film, transcending the limits of comedies to something that cuts straight to your heart. And by the way, I couldn't believe Roger Ebert's review, my only guess he didn't have enough perspective and he probably changed his mind after. But thanks to Ebert, I learned the definition of a good movie, from Howard Hawks' quote. It's made of three good scenes and no bad scenes. There are none in "Raising Arizona" and there are three mesmerizing sequences: one of the most promising and funny introductions ever, then the market scene that reinvents the foot-chase forever, and made it deeply intertwined with hillbilly yodel like banjo music did for "Bonnie and Clyde", and ten you have one of the most poignant and meaningful monologues ever. There are three great moments in "Raising Arizona", in the beginning, the middle and the ending, and if only for these moments, with so many laughs in-between, "Raising Arizona" is one of the greatest comedies ever  or my IMDb user name isn't ElMaruecan82.

    The Coen Brothers have made many great films and worked in many different genres. One of their most famous comedies is Raising Arizona, a fast paced, zany comedy that can only come from the minds of the Coens. H.I. "Hi" McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) is a career criminal who falls for policewoman Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter) and goes straight for her. After they get married they attempt to have a child, but when Ed finds out she is infertile and the pair unable to adopt the couple take the logically route of kidnapping a baby from a wealthy couple who have just had quintuplets. But their actions get complicated by two escaped convicted, a police investigation and a ruthless bounty hunter. Raising Arizona is a very funny comedy that zips along at a great pace. The Coens' fingerprints are all over this film, having a sharply written script and excellent direction throughout. The jokes are constant throughout the film, giving us a variety of style of humour, from great one-liners, character interactions and pure physical comedy. The Coens bring a lot of energy to the film as we get over the top set pieces like the robbery where Ed abandons Hi and the Coens being a brings a kinetic style with their camera movements and editing of set pieces. We get a great prologue at the beginning of the film as we find out about Hi and Ed's past and how they came to their solution with funny jokes on the way. As well as the direction, Raising Arizona is blessed with a top cast who give both comic and sincere performances. Cage and Hunter had great chemistry together, having excellent comic time and were committed to their roles. Cage worked well with his supporting cast as they assemble a top cast: John Goodman being a particular highlight as one of the escaped prisoners. The Coens Brothers' direction is frantic through the film, using fast paced editing, hand-held cameras and tracking shots, amplifying the comedy, showing this maniac universe and gives Raising Arizona a distinctive visual style. The Coen's regular composer Carter Burwell also supplies a great score for the film, particular the use of a country/folk like guitar score which was a perfect fit for the film. Raising Arizona is a very entertaining, funny and heartfelt comedy that can stand along some of the best works the Coen Brothers have had to offer. It is a screwball comedy that can cater to many tests from intelligent jokes, observations and character interactions, to more over the top physical and visual comedy.

    Honestly, I did not expect even the first Cohen brothers films to be really good. This one definitely is worth watching because the seriousness with which Cohen brothers make frivolous movies is best and this time. Busy throughout the film to make the foreground absurd or to the characters or to the situations in which they fall in, the two filmmakers get us into the world of attracting of opposites. Line from the movie, which can serve as an example here would be: "If a frog had wings, it would hardly hitting the legs into the body when jumping." In equally absurd way arises the love between a young policewoman and obsessive in robberies of shops criminal (collection of fools, as they point themselves). As she turns frigid, they decide to steal a child from a newly born five twins. And thus began the mess that does not stop until the end. The film is ideal for detente and kicking a bad mood and driving a good one.

    Raising Arizona is easily one of the funniest,greatest and most original Comedies of all time and a timeless film classic. Filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a wonderful screenplay,truly beautiful cinematography and an unforgettable score,Raising Arizona is The Coen Brothers at their best and greatest. Raising Arizona tells the story of H.I. McDunnough(Nicholas Cage),a criminal and repeat offender and police officer 'Ed' Edwina(Holly Hunter)who fall in love and after falling in love decide to get married and have kids. When H.I. and Ed can't conceive kids of their own,H.I and Ed kidnap a quintuplet,Nathan Arizona JR(T.J Kuhn JR) one of the children of local business man Nathan Arizona(Trey Wilson). When H.I and Ed take Nathan J.r and want to raise him as their own wild and hilarious things happen in their lives. Raising Arizona is one of the all-time great classic Comedies from The Coen Brothers that came after their amazing film debut Blood Simple. When filmmakers have a first film that is so acclaimed and well loved, most filmmakers have to do a second film that lives up to the quality of their first film and not only does Raising Arizona live up to Blood Simple but also gives viewers and brilliant and much lighter cinematic experience. One of the reasons Raising Arizona is excellent and truly hilarious is because The Coen Brothers have given us a flawless film that combines great laughs with style and substance where everything in the film is over the top and exaggerated to the point of going over the top beyond belief. The laughs and humor in the film are funny,ingenious and original with hilarious Slapstick Comedy,funny dialog and moments in the movie that have you laughing until your stomach hurts and will have tears running down your face. The laughs are so crazy and over the top you will you're watching a surreal live Action Cartoon. What is also great about the Humor in this film and other Coen Brother films is that the laughs are subtle and used in visuals and imagery that are not obvious the first time you watch RA but when you watch the film with multiple viewings you will notice or catch some of the visual jokes of the film. And speaking of of visuals RA is one of the most beautiful and visually stunning Comedies I have ever seen. Barry Sonnefield's photography is amazing and powerful with wide angle shots,close ups and shots of the sunlight,road and dusty world of Arizona. Sonnefield's photography gives the film a surreal and wild energy that you don't see in most comedies and that is one of the great things that set RZ apart from other films of it's type because RA can have wonderful style but also a great substance. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is hilarious and well and one of the best screenplays in Comedy history with the Coens giving the main great dialog that is funny,memorable and stylized as well as greatly using narration for H.I. McDunnough and lines from the main characters that are quotable and will stay in your mind. The two main characters H.I. and Ed McDunnough while over the top and are cartoon characters who are funny but are given great depth and humanity and you feel like the two truly love and care for one another and even though H.I and Ed kidnapped a baby they don't do for fame or money,they do it because they want to be parents and want to love a child and the kidnapping make the main characters more complex than they truly are and that is one of things that great about RA and the Coens. Although not an Action film RA has a couple of good Action and chase scenes that are thrilling and exciting. Especially the film's main chase scene which is one of the funniest,wildest,original and over the top chase scenes in film history and it is a classic chase that that you will never forget. The ending of the film is funny,beautiful and very optimistic and will make you wonder what will happen to H.I and ED. An great ending to a great film. The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Nicholas Cage is brilliant,funny and at his best as H.I McDunnough,with Cage bringing laughs and depth to the role. Holly Hunter is excellent as 'Ed' Edwina McDunnough,with Hunter feisty and funny and having great chemistry with Cage. Trey Wilson is wonderful and fun as Nathan Arizona,a local business man. John Goodman and William Forsythe are great,funny and over the top as Gale and Evelle Snoats,escaped convicts who are H.I's friends. Sam McMurray and Francis McDormand are amazing and hilarious as husband and wife Glen and Dot,friends of H.I. and Ed. Randell 'Tex' Cobb is fantastic as Leonard Smalls,a man hunter who's a man of few words and is looking for Nathan JR. The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is excellent,with The Coens always moving the camera,using wide angles,low angles,close-ups and giving the film a great visual style. Great direction by The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is is amazing,funny,beautiful and very quirky and matches the tone of the film,with Burwell greatly mixing whistles,yodeling,organs and banjos. Wonderful score by Burwell. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you check out Raising Arizona,a truly hilarious,funny and unforgettable Comedy and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I adore this one. I'll have you know it is my 'feelgood' movie, having seen it now a dozen times it never fails to lift my spirits. After some deliberation, I am finally putting it on my list of must see films. What the Coens have done here is a very delicate thing. The obvious first. What you see in the film is both 'real', a loving trailer trash couple cannot conceive a child, and sleepless bending of reality as the urge to steal one so they can finally have a 'full family unit' manifests around them in all sorts of crazy situations. The biker from Hell is the tip of the thread, first dreamed about and in a weird confluence of forces soon appears in reality as dreamed. From that point on, everything is askew while pointing to anxious dreaming. Prison pals from HI's criminal past show up in the middle of the night. The frantic hunt for Huggies, starting with another botched holdup. HI's boss as the dreary dead-end of family life. More obvious, the business with the hole in the ground. It isn't simply surreal, a term normally associated with vaguely weird stream-of-consciousness. It's film noir, the film is sandwiched after all between the much more openly noirish Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. The Coens get noir, where the desire for life to be other/better than it is (not for sex or money as in noir, but blissful family life here personified in the baby) causes peculiar whims in perception, and those whims mysteriously manifest in the narrator's 'choosing' of the reality he remembers, collapsing in the process. Noir is magical, alluring to this day, because all those things are causally inextricable, desire from dream or memory from mysterious happenings in the story, which is why we often collapse the whole knotted mess to the workings of some celestial fate. There's all sorts of stuff woven on top. Reagan's morning in America as neurotic hyper-normalcy, the bum HI as the flipside of that, laid-back and tied to the American tradition of glorified frontiersmen and criminals, lampooned in the biker. 1980's suburbia as consumerist limbo. It's a helluva ride. Next to Blue Velvet and Society, the definitive 1980's film. It does all sort of collapse together by the end, which supports and enhances the idea of the random , whimsical arising of dreams. Big Lebowski starts here. Its charm? You can 'get' this without 'getting' it. The whole Huggies sequence is as profound to me as any cinematic dream. But it isn't like Tarkovksy who bypasses the mind by long mystifying sweeps, hitting deep in this way. It strikes an amazing balance between self-conscious intelligent conception and the bypass in spontaneous asides of fun and tremendous heartHI and Ed (the lovely Holly Hunter) are one of the most loving couples in filmdom. Intelligence, fun and emotion, these three are inextricable. This being so, you can 'get' the film via any route. It ends with an Ozzie and Harriet movie dream of the perfect life.

    Criminal Herbert I. "Hi" (Nicolas Cage) after his continued visits to a prison happens to marry Edwina "Ed" after his latest release from prison. Soon the couple discovers that Ed is not fit to be a mother and are unable to adopt a baby due to Ed's Criminal record. So they decide to kidnap one of the Quints of a local furniture magnate "Nathan Arizona" believing it to be Nathan Jr. Problems arouse as Hi is visited by his prison buddies and he thinks of returning to his notorious lifestyle along with his supervisor discovering that kid is not his after he made an unsuccessful wife swapping offer to him. Matters get worse as a bounty hunter named Leo Smalls gets in search of Nathan Jr. to sell him in the market and Hi's buddies taking undue advantage of junior's identity. Do watch this early Coen Bros. movie because of some great comic scenes especially the scene where Hi steals a pack of diapers and it is one of those movies that gives us the insight into the kind of characters the duo generates, dialogues they write and unconventional music score that became symbolic for their future movies. MY RATING: 9/10

    The film Raising Arizona begins with the unfortunate life of H.I. McDunnough (Nicholas Cage) and his journeys in and out of prison where he meets his future wife, Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter), a corrections officer. The two get married and discover that they cannot have children of their own, despite their beliefs that they are good people and would make great parents. Around that time, Nathan and Florence Arizona (Trey Wilson and Lynne Kitei) give birth to quintuplets, and discover that so many children are "more than they can handle!" The McDunnoughs, with their good intentions in hand, kidnap one of the quintuplets to raise as their own, believing that they are doing the Arizona's a favor. The primary theme of this film is the effects of karma, or the idea that "what goes around comes around." This theme can be found throughout the film, as characters like Gale and Evelle Snoats (John Goodman and William Forsythe) fail in their attempt to rob a bank and eventually return to jail. The theme can also be found through the consequences that the McDunnoughs face as a result of the kidnapping, and the reactions of Nathan Arizona when he finally learns what has happened to his son. The primary tool used to explain the theme of the film is the voice-over. A voice-over can be used to fill in gaps and make a film cohesive, or to explain background or contextual information to the viewer (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). In Raising Arizona, the voice-over is used for both reasons, and gives thorough insights into the thoughts and motives of the characters. This tool is very effective in conveying the theme of the film in that sense. The acting throughout the film is also very effective in helping to convey the theme of the film. H.I. is a very innocent character, despite his many crimes, and the acting portrays this well. Ed is another na&iuml;ve character, who does not fully understand the consequences of her actions. As both of these characters begin to realize the consequences of their actions, they begin to take responsibility for them and try to do what is best for everyone. In that sense, both actors help to contribute to the theme of the film by effectively displaying the emotions and motivations of their characters. The theme of this film is similar to the themes of many other films, like, for example, the film Elf, where the primary character, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell), acts on his good intentions, even when his actions may not be the right thing to do. For example, in one scene, Buddy gets in a fight with a store "Santa" (Artie Lange) because Buddy knows that the man is an imposter. The message of this film is very important to everyone, because good intentions are very important, but it is still important that one always tries to do what is right. Though they may have started off on the wrong path, Ed and H.I. finally make amends and do what is right for everyone involved in the situation. References Boggs, J. M. & Petrie, D. W. (2008).

    Raising Arizona is a film that follows the story of an unconventional couple; convict Hi (Cage) and police officer Ed (Hunter), as they attempt to find harmony and happiness in their lives together. However, their greatest obstacle is Ed's sterility that slowly wears on their relationship and threatens their sanity until opportunity arises in the form of a wealthy local whose wife births "more than she can handle". Accomplishing the abduction proves a bit difficult, but the rabid persistence of Ed drives their mission to success, and with the addition of this vital piece, it seems a true family is born. Unfortunately, prying and obnoxious colleagues, mischievous jailbirds/buddies, and a gritty detective with a Harley threaten their happiness, but also demonstrate how misguided and selfish their actions have been. Returning the baby to an appreciative and surprisingly sympathetic father, Hi reflects on the affection we have for children, even if they're not our own and is able to sleep peacefully with dreams for the future that he hopes holds a family of his very own. I generally appreciate the Coen Brother's films and what I appreciate most is their ability to hold interest of the audience through plot twists and strong characters; there's nothing extreme or very showy about their work and yet it stands out because there is only ever and illusion of normalcy and sanity in their characters or the plot, really the work is quite complex but we appreciate it more because they make no pretense. Raising Arizona continues this tradition and also has quite a flavor of Americana, enhanced greatly by the colorful characters. The humor was ludicrous most times, but it was balanced through the sensitive and reflective nature of the protagonist, whose broodings lend itself to the underlying sense of loneliness and hopelessness of the characters and the landscape and drive the rich plot forward. I feel that any criticism would simply be void for two reasons: I believe that this film is very stylistic and I don't believe that they ventured out of this particular structure, any risk they took (including the dream sequences) had basis in reality and only served to give the film more poetic flavor, and secondly, I believe that the film was unique and heartfelt among it's genre, which at times is difficult to achieve in something externally so seemingly detached as comedy, and mainly, I think there was valid reasoning behind it's creation, which is my only objection with modern film. The cinematography of the film was very interesting and was able to keep the audience occupied by the sheer amount of stimulation the wild camera movements brought. I was able to appreciate the shaky camera work simply because I think it does justice to Hi's convict past as well as his current lifestyle, punctuated by his most daring criminal offense yet. This apparently dramatic and brutal world is something that few of us can sympathize with and I think the long takes through several different environments contributes to that foreign aspect of the film that quite frankly makes it hilarious. Motifs in the film include the joined hands of Hi and Ed, representing their bond and their support of each other, the fire that erupts from the detective, representing his nature, and the convenient store that represents Hi's temptation or the pull of his old life. The brothers use this as well as a few non-diegetic inserts (including baby toys) to bring a bit of understanding to the rapidly moving plot, but it is interesting to note that this veers a bit from the slapstick genre that is quite shallow and brings a poetic aspect to the film. In the abduction scene the use of high-angle and low-angle shots capture flawlessly both the perspective of Hi and of the babies and the power shift that takes place between them, succeeding in making Hi seem vulnerable among these small creatures. Also, throughout the entire film the use of the wide-angle lens is used, making people and surroundings seem distorted and often a bit out of proportion. The abduction scene demonstrates the use of this very well, especially when the babies are taking a very long time to reach the door and then the end of the hallway, giving Hi enough time to catch them before Mrs. Arizona discovers. This also contributes to the suspense of the scene, because everything seems to take longer to happen and Hi is running out of time to act. Off-screen action and voice is used quite a bit to stage a change in events in the plot and repetition of certain events forming a montage is comedic as well as clarity inducing. It really strikes both emotional stances quite well and makes for a heartfelt and poetic take on the slapstick comedy genre, aided by the strong narrative voice that guides us through a ridiculous and tragic journey of an unlikely couple trying to find the missing piece in their family.

    A quick checklist for anyone considering this movie: 1. Coenheads - if you are one, proceed to checkout 2. Hollow humorist - if you like to be force fed your humor, you're in luck. 3. Bicoastalism - plenty of middle/Southern/Western stereotypes here 4. Amateur Auteurs - Watch this film so you can earn your "I'm-more- sophisticated-than-you" pin. All others should bypass this cinematic desert. It has been said that much art is devised to impress other artists. I think that attitude is central to Coeney Island, and this film certainly falls into the category euphemistically called "quirky". Products such as this can't be blamed for aiming squarely at their intended audience. If you like this kind of pseudo-intellectual fare, bully for you. There are plenty of vendors for this kind of ware. All others who will try to find anything substantial will be sorely disappointed. You won't experience wildness, depth, sentiment, wonder, fury, intrigue, edginess, insight, lasciviousness, or even a good joke. In fact, what's really missing is honesty. You will be served up mounds of pretense and self-important contrivance, infused with long-expired sophomorism, and powdered with clip art humanism. Package above with ,uh, quirky dialogue (hard to assign that term since the characters don't express anything to each other or the audience) and you have all the haughty form-over-substance. cookie-cutter originality that the anesthetized soul craves. It was finely-crafted bubble-wrap, I admit that.

    Raising Arizona is a not-so-funny comedy surrounding the marriage and infertility of ex-cop, Ed McDonnough (Holly Hunter) and her ex-con husband, H.I. (Nicolas Cage). When the couple is told by her doctor that they would not be able to conceive a child of their own, Ed is devastated. While watching television one evening, the couple sees that Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), a rich, furniture store owner and his wife were now the proud parents of quintuplets. Ed concocts a plan to "borrow" one of their babies because she believes they "have their hands full" with 5 babies. This in turn sets off a crazy string of events which leave the couple in a fight for their "borrowed" child, their freedom and their love for one another. The theme of Raising Arizona is a character's struggle within themselves to soothe the constant "wants" in life that are not necessarily needed. Throughout the movie, Ed just wants to be happy. Before marrying H.I., she just wanted to meet the right man and get married. During one scene when Ed is booking H.I. into one of his many jail stints, she is sobbing because her then fianc&eacute;' had broken up with her. This was the first time that Ed realized that she had feelings for H.I., when he showed compassion for her and told her that her fianc&eacute;' had to be stupid to leave her. Soon after, Ed and H.I. were married and she immediately wanted to start having babies. This proved to be impossible for them and her desperate "want" to be a mother caused her to grow depressed, lose interest in everything - including cleaning her house and she lost her job. H.I. just seems to be along for the crazy ride. The wild story line and almost unfathomable shenanigans in this movie are somewhat similar to the 1990 Dennis Dugan movie, Problem Child, starring John Ritter. In both movies, there are couples who desperately want to have a child and when they are both given what they want it proves to be much more than they can handle. Both movies are filled with conflict and chaos right up to the very end. The motifs and camera angles brought out the theme of this movie and made it more exciting to watch. Throughout the movie the viewer is constantly reminded that Ed wants a baby and after Baby Arizona is "borrowed", the camera is fixated on how Ed and H.I. plan to keep him and keep their secret. The camera techniques were great in this movie. There were several parallel cuts that took the viewer back and forth between two different locations as the suspense was rising. In one particular scene, Ed, H.I. and Baby Jr. are driving home from spending a day with friends and they pull into a store to pick up some diapers. H.I. is tempted to resort to his old ways and ends up robbing the store. Ed sees him through the window and immediately becomes angry and drives away, leaving him to fend for himself. What H.I. doesn't anticipate though, is the store clerk is ready for him. After pushing an emergency button to alert the authorities, the clerk pulls out a rifle and starts shooting at H.I. Just as he is running away the cops pull up and start a wild chase. The cameras cut back and forth between H.I. running through streets, yards and houses, the cops chasing him and Ed, who had a change of heart about leaving him and decides to go back and try to help save him from the police. All of the chaos and goofy humor combined with a crazy plot take the viewer right back to the theme of the movie, choose your "wants" lightly because they just might turn out to be your "want nots".

    You've gotta hand it to the Coen brothers, they sure know how to inject style and flamboyance in their creations. And to think that "Raising Arizona" was only their second feature film makes the accomplishment even more impressive although "Blood Simple." was powerful enough an announcement of two upcoming talents threatening to shake Hollywood's conventions with a unique sense of eccentricity, and human depth. "Blood Simple." was still borrowing some elements from film-noir and Hitchcock movies, and, no matter how effective it was, it could have easily been targeted as an exercise in style. This is why the Coen brothers couldn't have made a better choice by making a zany comedy with a tender and more optimistic tone. And not only the film works but "Raising Arizona" is now a comedy classic, so special that it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath than 80's comedies for the simple reason that it differs from what was made in that decade. And that's the thing about the Coen brothers, they make timeless films, set in universes, playing like crossroads between fantasy and reality, where their stories float with a bizarre but so penetrating poetry. I know this is a Coen brothers' so we're tempted to get deeper on the subject. Granted it's not just a story about two people who kidnap a baby because they can't have one, there are far more symbolism and philosophical material lying underneath the screwball carapace, but how about enjoying the film for what it is: one hilarious piece of cinematic greatness carried by the kind of colorful cast that made the Coen's films so lively. And what a cast! Nicolas Cage is H.I. aka "Hi" McDunnough, a multiple recidivist specialized in robbing market stores and Holly Hunter is Edwina aka 'Ed', the photographer who took so many mug shots she ended up proving that indeed, opposites attracted. But the Coen brothers are not the type of directors to comfortably sit on the presence of two solid protagonist, they know supporting characters are the spices that give the film its flavor. So, we have the two escaped prison buddies, two brothers played by two Johns, John Goodman, who'd become one of the Coen's greatest asset with such a physical presence he'd steal the show anytime, anywhere and Forsythe as his dim-witted brother. There is Sam McMumurray as Glen, the bourgeois pain-in-the-ass and the late Trey Wilson as Nathan Arizona, father of cute blonde-haired quints, the furniture magnate whose motto consist on concluding all his statements with "or my name isn't Nathan Arizona". Each character illuminates the screen with a unique presence, even little Nathan Jr. makes you believe people would kill each other to get him, and Frances McDormand is given a less important play but plays it with the required over-the-top way you'd expect from the woman who chose a guy like Glen for husband. Speaking of Glen, nothing against Sam McMurray but I would have loved to see John Turturro playing his part, if only because it would have made "Raising Arizona"'s the consummate Coen brothers' film, with characters before stories. Hell, it goes even to the point where the most seemingly inoffensive market-cashier can tot a gunshot and become a Dirty Harry-like figure, no one is to be underestimated, not when laughs are at stakes. Naturally, such story deserves a worthy villain and this is where Randal 'Tex' Cobb makes his entrances, as a man coming from nowhere, supposedly incarnating the devil, whenever he goes, grass never grow back and this modern Atilla of biker of the apocalypse first emerges in HI's dream after he stole Nathan's kid. He symbolizes HI's conscience, something that will torment him until he finds the way to redeem himself, and this is the philosophical stuff hidden beneath the film, it's about characters doing morally wrong things, and finding their own path to redemption. When a recidivist teams up with a cop and both stole parents' fruits of love, you know this ain't the way to reach marital happiness. And the whole narrative is cooked up up in typical Mid-West accent, flirting with caricature but giving "Raising Arizona"its colorful spirit, the same as "Fargo" with its overuse of Scandinavian accent made of "Yah" and "You betcha". This is the Coens' signature and it doesn't limit to dialogs but goes to the soundtrack and from the title to the score, you have the hillbilly thing screaming all over the place. Till today, it's impossible not to hear "Raising Arizona" without having that fast-paced upbeat banjo music and catchy yodel that makes you want to escape from whatever makes your routine. You got it, "Raising Arizona" is pure entertaining escapism, with a man and a woman giving their life a meaning the wrong way, before learning the lessons, the hard way. And what a lesson! the conclusion of the film is probably the most insightful and beautiful thing ever put in a film, transcending the limits of comedies to something that cuts straight to your heart. And by the way, I couldn't believe Roger Ebert's review, my only guess he didn't have enough perspective and he probably changed his mind after. But thanks to Ebert, I learned the definition of a good movie, from Howard Hawks' quote. It's made of three good scenes and no bad scenes. There are none in "Raising Arizona" and there are three mesmerizing sequences: one of the most promising and funny introductions ever, then the market scene that reinvents the foot-chase forever, and made it deeply intertwined with hillbilly yodel like banjo music did for "Bonnie and Clyde", and ten you have one of the most poignant and meaningful monologues ever. There are three great moments in "Raising Arizona", in the beginning, the middle and the ending, and if only for these moments, with so many laughs in-between, "Raising Arizona" is one of the greatest comedies ever  or my IMDb user name isn't ElMaruecan82.

    The Coen Brothers have made many great films and worked in many different genres. One of their most famous comedies is Raising Arizona, a fast paced, zany comedy that can only come from the minds of the Coens. H.I. "Hi" McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) is a career criminal who falls for policewoman Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter) and goes straight for her. After they get married they attempt to have a child, but when Ed finds out she is infertile and the pair unable to adopt the couple take the logically route of kidnapping a baby from a wealthy couple who have just had quintuplets. But their actions get complicated by two escaped convicted, a police investigation and a ruthless bounty hunter. Raising Arizona is a very funny comedy that zips along at a great pace. The Coens' fingerprints are all over this film, having a sharply written script and excellent direction throughout. The jokes are constant throughout the film, giving us a variety of style of humour, from great one-liners, character interactions and pure physical comedy. The Coens bring a lot of energy to the film as we get over the top set pieces like the robbery where Ed abandons Hi and the Coens being a brings a kinetic style with their camera movements and editing of set pieces. We get a great prologue at the beginning of the film as we find out about Hi and Ed's past and how they came to their solution with funny jokes on the way. As well as the direction, Raising Arizona is blessed with a top cast who give both comic and sincere performances. Cage and Hunter had great chemistry together, having excellent comic time and were committed to their roles. Cage worked well with his supporting cast as they assemble a top cast: John Goodman being a particular highlight as one of the escaped prisoners. The Coens Brothers' direction is frantic through the film, using fast paced editing, hand-held cameras and tracking shots, amplifying the comedy, showing this maniac universe and gives Raising Arizona a distinctive visual style. The Coen's regular composer Carter Burwell also supplies a great score for the film, particular the use of a country/folk like guitar score which was a perfect fit for the film. Raising Arizona is a very entertaining, funny and heartfelt comedy that can stand along some of the best works the Coen Brothers have had to offer. It is a screwball comedy that can cater to many tests from intelligent jokes, observations and character interactions, to more over the top physical and visual comedy.

    Honestly, I did not expect even the first Cohen brothers films to be really good. This one definitely is worth watching because the seriousness with which Cohen brothers make frivolous movies is best and this time. Busy throughout the film to make the foreground absurd or to the characters or to the situations in which they fall in, the two filmmakers get us into the world of attracting of opposites. Line from the movie, which can serve as an example here would be: "If a frog had wings, it would hardly hitting the legs into the body when jumping." In equally absurd way arises the love between a young policewoman and obsessive in robberies of shops criminal (collection of fools, as they point themselves). As she turns frigid, they decide to steal a child from a newly born five twins. And thus began the mess that does not stop until the end. The film is ideal for detente and kicking a bad mood and driving a good one.

    Raising Arizona is easily one of the funniest,greatest and most original Comedies of all time and a timeless film classic. Filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a wonderful screenplay,truly beautiful cinematography and an unforgettable score,Raising Arizona is The Coen Brothers at their best and greatest. Raising Arizona tells the story of H.I. McDunnough(Nicholas Cage),a criminal and repeat offender and police officer 'Ed' Edwina(Holly Hunter)who fall in love and after falling in love decide to get married and have kids. When H.I. and Ed can't conceive kids of their own,H.I and Ed kidnap a quintuplet,Nathan Arizona JR(T.J Kuhn JR) one of the children of local business man Nathan Arizona(Trey Wilson). When H.I and Ed take Nathan J.r and want to raise him as their own wild and hilarious things happen in their lives. Raising Arizona is one of the all-time great classic Comedies from The Coen Brothers that came after their amazing film debut Blood Simple. When filmmakers have a first film that is so acclaimed and well loved, most filmmakers have to do a second film that lives up to the quality of their first film and not only does Raising Arizona live up to Blood Simple but also gives viewers and brilliant and much lighter cinematic experience. One of the reasons Raising Arizona is excellent and truly hilarious is because The Coen Brothers have given us a flawless film that combines great laughs with style and substance where everything in the film is over the top and exaggerated to the point of going over the top beyond belief. The laughs and humor in the film are funny,ingenious and original with hilarious Slapstick Comedy,funny dialog and moments in the movie that have you laughing until your stomach hurts and will have tears running down your face. The laughs are so crazy and over the top you will you're watching a surreal live Action Cartoon. What is also great about the Humor in this film and other Coen Brother films is that the laughs are subtle and used in visuals and imagery that are not obvious the first time you watch RA but when you watch the film with multiple viewings you will notice or catch some of the visual jokes of the film. And speaking of of visuals RA is one of the most beautiful and visually stunning Comedies I have ever seen. Barry Sonnefield's photography is amazing and powerful with wide angle shots,close ups and shots of the sunlight,road and dusty world of Arizona. Sonnefield's photography gives the film a surreal and wild energy that you don't see in most comedies and that is one of the great things that set RZ apart from other films of it's type because RA can have wonderful style but also a great substance. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is hilarious and well and one of the best screenplays in Comedy history with the Coens giving the main great dialog that is funny,memorable and stylized as well as greatly using narration for H.I. McDunnough and lines from the main characters that are quotable and will stay in your mind. The two main characters H.I. and Ed McDunnough while over the top and are cartoon characters who are funny but are given great depth and humanity and you feel like the two truly love and care for one another and even though H.I and Ed kidnapped a baby they don't do for fame or money,they do it because they want to be parents and want to love a child and the kidnapping make the main characters more complex than they truly are and that is one of things that great about RA and the Coens. Although not an Action film RA has a couple of good Action and chase scenes that are thrilling and exciting. Especially the film's main chase scene which is one of the funniest,wildest,original and over the top chase scenes in film history and it is a classic chase that that you will never forget. The ending of the film is funny,beautiful and very optimistic and will make you wonder what will happen to H.I and ED. An great ending to a great film. The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Nicholas Cage is brilliant,funny and at his best as H.I McDunnough,with Cage bringing laughs and depth to the role. Holly Hunter is excellent as 'Ed' Edwina McDunnough,with Hunter feisty and funny and having great chemistry with Cage. Trey Wilson is wonderful and fun as Nathan Arizona,a local business man. John Goodman and William Forsythe are great,funny and over the top as Gale and Evelle Snoats,escaped convicts who are H.I's friends. Sam McMurray and Francis McDormand are amazing and hilarious as husband and wife Glen and Dot,friends of H.I. and Ed. Randell 'Tex' Cobb is fantastic as Leonard Smalls,a man hunter who's a man of few words and is looking for Nathan JR. The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is excellent,with The Coens always moving the camera,using wide angles,low angles,close-ups and giving the film a great visual style. Great direction by The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is is amazing,funny,beautiful and very quirky and matches the tone of the film,with Burwell greatly mixing whistles,yodeling,organs and banjos. Wonderful score by Burwell. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you check out Raising Arizona,a truly hilarious,funny and unforgettable Comedy and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I adore this one. I'll have you know it is my 'feelgood' movie, having seen it now a dozen times it never fails to lift my spirits. After some deliberation, I am finally putting it on my list of must see films. What the Coens have done here is a very delicate thing. The obvious first. What you see in the film is both 'real', a loving trailer trash couple cannot conceive a child, and sleepless bending of reality as the urge to steal one so they can finally have a 'full family unit' manifests around them in all sorts of crazy situations. The biker from Hell is the tip of the thread, first dreamed about and in a weird confluence of forces soon appears in reality as dreamed. From that point on, everything is askew while pointing to anxious dreaming. Prison pals from HI's criminal past show up in the middle of the night. The frantic hunt for Huggies, starting with another botched holdup. HI's boss as the dreary dead-end of family life. More obvious, the business with the hole in the ground. It isn't simply surreal, a term normally associated with vaguely weird stream-of-consciousness. It's film noir, the film is sandwiched after all between the much more openly noirish Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. The Coens get noir, where the desire for life to be other/better than it is (not for sex or money as in noir, but blissful family life here personified in the baby) causes peculiar whims in perception, and those whims mysteriously manifest in the narrator's 'choosing' of the reality he remembers, collapsing in the process. Noir is magical, alluring to this day, because all those things are causally inextricable, desire from dream or memory from mysterious happenings in the story, which is why we often collapse the whole knotted mess to the workings of some celestial fate. There's all sorts of stuff woven on top. Reagan's morning in America as neurotic hyper-normalcy, the bum HI as the flipside of that, laid-back and tied to the American tradition of glorified frontiersmen and criminals, lampooned in the biker. 1980's suburbia as consumerist limbo. It's a helluva ride. Next to Blue Velvet and Society, the definitive 1980's film. It does all sort of collapse together by the end, which supports and enhances the idea of the random , whimsical arising of dreams. Big Lebowski starts here. Its charm? You can 'get' this without 'getting' it. The whole Huggies sequence is as profound to me as any cinematic dream. But it isn't like Tarkovksy who bypasses the mind by long mystifying sweeps, hitting deep in this way. It strikes an amazing balance between self-conscious intelligent conception and the bypass in spontaneous asides of fun and tremendous heartHI and Ed (the lovely Holly Hunter) are one of the most loving couples in filmdom. Intelligence, fun and emotion, these three are inextricable. This being so, you can 'get' the film via any route. It ends with an Ozzie and Harriet movie dream of the perfect life.

    Criminal Herbert I. "Hi" (Nicolas Cage) after his continued visits to a prison happens to marry Edwina "Ed" after his latest release from prison. Soon the couple discovers that Ed is not fit to be a mother and are unable to adopt a baby due to Ed's Criminal record. So they decide to kidnap one of the Quints of a local furniture magnate "Nathan Arizona" believing it to be Nathan Jr. Problems arouse as Hi is visited by his prison buddies and he thinks of returning to his notorious lifestyle along with his supervisor discovering that kid is not his after he made an unsuccessful wife swapping offer to him. Matters get worse as a bounty hunter named Leo Smalls gets in search of Nathan Jr. to sell him in the market and Hi's buddies taking undue advantage of junior's identity. Do watch this early Coen Bros. movie because of some great comic scenes especially the scene where Hi steals a pack of diapers and it is one of those movies that gives us the insight into the kind of characters the duo generates, dialogues they write and unconventional music score that became symbolic for their future movies. MY RATING: 9/10

    The film Raising Arizona begins with the unfortunate life of H.I. McDunnough (Nicholas Cage) and his journeys in and out of prison where he meets his future wife, Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter), a corrections officer. The two get married and discover that they cannot have children of their own, despite their beliefs that they are good people and would make great parents. Around that time, Nathan and Florence Arizona (Trey Wilson and Lynne Kitei) give birth to quintuplets, and discover that so many children are "more than they can handle!" The McDunnoughs, with their good intentions in hand, kidnap one of the quintuplets to raise as their own, believing that they are doing the Arizona's a favor. The primary theme of this film is the effects of karma, or the idea that "what goes around comes around." This theme can be found throughout the film, as characters like Gale and Evelle Snoats (John Goodman and William Forsythe) fail in their attempt to rob a bank and eventually return to jail. The theme can also be found through the consequences that the McDunnoughs face as a result of the kidnapping, and the reactions of Nathan Arizona when he finally learns what has happened to his son. The primary tool used to explain the theme of the film is the voice-over. A voice-over can be used to fill in gaps and make a film cohesive, or to explain background or contextual information to the viewer (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). In Raising Arizona, the voice-over is used for both reasons, and gives thorough insights into the thoughts and motives of the characters. This tool is very effective in conveying the theme of the film in that sense. The acting throughout the film is also very effective in helping to convey the theme of the film. H.I. is a very innocent character, despite his many crimes, and the acting portrays this well. Ed is another na&iuml;ve character, who does not fully understand the consequences of her actions. As both of these characters begin to realize the consequences of their actions, they begin to take responsibility for them and try to do what is best for everyone. In that sense, both actors help to contribute to the theme of the film by effectively displaying the emotions and motivations of their characters. The theme of this film is similar to the themes of many other films, like, for example, the film Elf, where the primary character, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell), acts on his good intentions, even when his actions may not be the right thing to do. For example, in one scene, Buddy gets in a fight with a store "Santa" (Artie Lange) because Buddy knows that the man is an imposter. The message of this film is very important to everyone, because good intentions are very important, but it is still important that one always tries to do what is right. Though they may have started off on the wrong path, Ed and H.I. finally make amends and do what is right for everyone involved in the situation. References Boggs, J. M. & Petrie, D. W. (2008).

    Raising Arizona is a film that follows the story of an unconventional couple; convict Hi (Cage) and police officer Ed (Hunter), as they attempt to find harmony and happiness in their lives together. However, their greatest obstacle is Ed's sterility that slowly wears on their relationship and threatens their sanity until opportunity arises in the form of a wealthy local whose wife births "more than she can handle". Accomplishing the abduction proves a bit difficult, but the rabid persistence of Ed drives their mission to success, and with the addition of this vital piece, it seems a true family is born. Unfortunately, prying and obnoxious colleagues, mischievous jailbirds/buddies, and a gritty detective with a Harley threaten their happiness, but also demonstrate how misguided and selfish their actions have been. Returning the baby to an appreciative and surprisingly sympathetic father, Hi reflects on the affection we have for children, even if they're not our own and is able to sleep peacefully with dreams for the future that he hopes holds a family of his very own. I generally appreciate the Coen Brother's films and what I appreciate most is their ability to hold interest of the audience through plot twists and strong characters; there's nothing extreme or very showy about their work and yet it stands out because there is only ever and illusion of normalcy and sanity in their characters or the plot, really the work is quite complex but we appreciate it more because they make no pretense. Raising Arizona continues this tradition and also has quite a flavor of Americana, enhanced greatly by the colorful characters. The humor was ludicrous most times, but it was balanced through the sensitive and reflective nature of the protagonist, whose broodings lend itself to the underlying sense of loneliness and hopelessness of the characters and the landscape and drive the rich plot forward. I feel that any criticism would simply be void for two reasons: I believe that this film is very stylistic and I don't believe that they ventured out of this particular structure, any risk they took (including the dream sequences) had basis in reality and only served to give the film more poetic flavor, and secondly, I believe that the film was unique and heartfelt among it's genre, which at times is difficult to achieve in something externally so seemingly detached as comedy, and mainly, I think there was valid reasoning behind it's creation, which is my only objection with modern film. The cinematography of the film was very interesting and was able to keep the audience occupied by the sheer amount of stimulation the wild camera movements brought. I was able to appreciate the shaky camera work simply because I think it does justice to Hi's convict past as well as his current lifestyle, punctuated by his most daring criminal offense yet. This apparently dramatic and brutal world is something that few of us can sympathize with and I think the long takes through several different environments contributes to that foreign aspect of the film that quite frankly makes it hilarious. Motifs in the film include the joined hands of Hi and Ed, representing their bond and their support of each other, the fire that erupts from the detective, representing his nature, and the convenient store that represents Hi's temptation or the pull of his old life. The brothers use this as well as a few non-diegetic inserts (including baby toys) to bring a bit of understanding to the rapidly moving plot, but it is interesting to note that this veers a bit from the slapstick genre that is quite shallow and brings a poetic aspect to the film. In the abduction scene the use of high-angle and low-angle shots capture flawlessly both the perspective of Hi and of the babies and the power shift that takes place between them, succeeding in making Hi seem vulnerable among these small creatures. Also, throughout the entire film the use of the wide-angle lens is used, making people and surroundings seem distorted and often a bit out of proportion. The abduction scene demonstrates the use of this very well, especially when the babies are taking a very long time to reach the door and then the end of the hallway, giving Hi enough time to catch them before Mrs. Arizona discovers. This also contributes to the suspense of the scene, because everything seems to take longer to happen and Hi is running out of time to act. Off-screen action and voice is used quite a bit to stage a change in events in the plot and repetition of certain events forming a montage is comedic as well as clarity inducing. It really strikes both emotional stances quite well and makes for a heartfelt and poetic take on the slapstick comedy genre, aided by the strong narrative voice that guides us through a ridiculous and tragic journey of an unlikely couple trying to find the missing piece in their family.

    A quick checklist for anyone considering this movie: 1. Coenheads - if you are one, proceed to checkout 2. Hollow humorist - if you like to be force fed your humor, you're in luck. 3. Bicoastalism - plenty of middle/Southern/Western stereotypes here 4. Amateur Auteurs - Watch this film so you can earn your "I'm-more- sophisticated-than-you" pin. All others should bypass this cinematic desert. It has been said that much art is devised to impress other artists. I think that attitude is central to Coeney Island, and this film certainly falls into the category euphemistically called "quirky". Products such as this can't be blamed for aiming squarely at their intended audience. If you like this kind of pseudo-intellectual fare, bully for you. There are plenty of vendors for this kind of ware. All others who will try to find anything substantial will be sorely disappointed. You won't experience wildness, depth, sentiment, wonder, fury, intrigue, edginess, insight, lasciviousness, or even a good joke. In fact, what's really missing is honesty. You will be served up mounds of pretense and self-important contrivance, infused with long-expired sophomorism, and powdered with clip art humanism. Package above with ,uh, quirky dialogue (hard to assign that term since the characters don't express anything to each other or the audience) and you have all the haughty form-over-substance. cookie-cutter originality that the anesthetized soul craves. It was finely-crafted bubble-wrap, I admit that.

    Raising Arizona is a not-so-funny comedy surrounding the marriage and infertility of ex-cop, Ed McDonnough (Holly Hunter) and her ex-con husband, H.I. (Nicolas Cage). When the couple is told by her doctor that they would not be able to conceive a child of their own, Ed is devastated. While watching television one evening, the couple sees that Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), a rich, furniture store owner and his wife were now the proud parents of quintuplets. Ed concocts a plan to "borrow" one of their babies because she believes they "have their hands full" with 5 babies. This in turn sets off a crazy string of events which leave the couple in a fight for their "borrowed" child, their freedom and their love for one another. The theme of Raising Arizona is a character's struggle within themselves to soothe the constant "wants" in life that are not necessarily needed. Throughout the movie, Ed just wants to be happy. Before marrying H.I., she just wanted to meet the right man and get married. During one scene when Ed is booking H.I. into one of his many jail stints, she is sobbing because her then fianc&eacute;' had broken up with her. This was the first time that Ed realized that she had feelings for H.I., when he showed compassion for her and told her that her fianc&eacute;' had to be stupid to leave her. Soon after, Ed and H.I. were married and she immediately wanted to start having babies. This proved to be impossible for them and her desperate "want" to be a mother caused her to grow depressed, lose interest in everything - including cleaning her house and she lost her job. H.I. just seems to be along for the crazy ride. The wild story line and almost unfathomable shenanigans in this movie are somewhat similar to the 1990 Dennis Dugan movie, Problem Child, starring John Ritter. In both movies, there are couples who desperately want to have a child and when they are both given what they want it proves to be much more than they can handle. Both movies are filled with conflict and chaos right up to the very end. The motifs and camera angles brought out the theme of this movie and made it more exciting to watch. Throughout the movie the viewer is constantly reminded that Ed wants a baby and after Baby Arizona is "borrowed", the camera is fixated on how Ed and H.I. plan to keep him and keep their secret. The camera techniques were great in this movie. There were several parallel cuts that took the viewer back and forth between two different locations as the suspense was rising. In one particular scene, Ed, H.I. and Baby Jr. are driving home from spending a day with friends and they pull into a store to pick up some diapers. H.I. is tempted to resort to his old ways and ends up robbing the store. Ed sees him through the window and immediately becomes angry and drives away, leaving him to fend for himself. What H.I. doesn't anticipate though, is the store clerk is ready for him. After pushing an emergency button to alert the authorities, the clerk pulls out a rifle and starts shooting at H.I. Just as he is running away the cops pull up and start a wild chase. The cameras cut back and forth between H.I. running through streets, yards and houses, the cops chasing him and Ed, who had a change of heart about leaving him and decides to go back and try to help save him from the police. All of the chaos and goofy humor combined with a crazy plot take the viewer right back to the theme of the movie, choose your "wants" lightly because they just might turn out to be your "want nots".

    You've gotta hand it to the Coen brothers, they sure know how to inject style and flamboyance in their creations. And to think that "Raising Arizona" was only their second feature film makes the accomplishment even more impressive although "Blood Simple." was powerful enough an announcement of two upcoming talents threatening to shake Hollywood's conventions with a unique sense of eccentricity, and human depth. "Blood Simple." was still borrowing some elements from film-noir and Hitchcock movies, and, no matter how effective it was, it could have easily been targeted as an exercise in style. This is why the Coen brothers couldn't have made a better choice by making a zany comedy with a tender and more optimistic tone. And not only the film works but "Raising Arizona" is now a comedy classic, so special that it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath than 80's comedies for the simple reason that it differs from what was made in that decade. And that's the thing about the Coen brothers, they make timeless films, set in universes, playing like crossroads between fantasy and reality, where their stories float with a bizarre but so penetrating poetry. I know this is a Coen brothers' so we're tempted to get deeper on the subject. Granted it's not just a story about two people who kidnap a baby because they can't have one, there are far more symbolism and philosophical material lying underneath the screwball carapace, but how about enjoying the film for what it is: one hilarious piece of cinematic greatness carried by the kind of colorful cast that made the Coen's films so lively. And what a cast! Nicolas Cage is H.I. aka "Hi" McDunnough, a multiple recidivist specialized in robbing market stores and Holly Hunter is Edwina aka 'Ed', the photographer who took so many mug shots she ended up proving that indeed, opposites attracted. But the Coen brothers are not the type of directors to comfortably sit on the presence of two solid protagonist, they know supporting characters are the spices that give the film its flavor. So, we have the two escaped prison buddies, two brothers played by two Johns, John Goodman, who'd become one of the Coen's greatest asset with such a physical presence he'd steal the show anytime, anywhere and Forsythe as his dim-witted brother. There is Sam McMumurray as Glen, the bourgeois pain-in-the-ass and the late Trey Wilson as Nathan Arizona, father of cute blonde-haired quints, the furniture magnate whose motto consist on concluding all his statements with "or my name isn't Nathan Arizona". Each character illuminates the screen with a unique presence, even little Nathan Jr. makes you believe people would kill each other to get him, and Frances McDormand is given a less important play but plays it with the required over-the-top way you'd expect from the woman who chose a guy like Glen for husband. Speaking of Glen, nothing against Sam McMurray but I would have loved to see John Turturro playing his part, if only because it would have made "Raising Arizona"'s the consummate Coen brothers' film, with characters before stories. Hell, it goes even to the point where the most seemingly inoffensive market-cashier can tot a gunshot and become a Dirty Harry-like figure, no one is to be underestimated, not when laughs are at stakes. Naturally, such story deserves a worthy villain and this is where Randal 'Tex' Cobb makes his entrances, as a man coming from nowhere, supposedly incarnating the devil, whenever he goes, grass never grow back and this modern Atilla of biker of the apocalypse first emerges in HI's dream after he stole Nathan's kid. He symbolizes HI's conscience, something that will torment him until he finds the way to redeem himself, and this is the philosophical stuff hidden beneath the film, it's about characters doing morally wrong things, and finding their own path to redemption. When a recidivist teams up with a cop and both stole parents' fruits of love, you know this ain't the way to reach marital happiness. And the whole narrative is cooked up up in typical Mid-West accent, flirting with caricature but giving "Raising Arizona"its colorful spirit, the same as "Fargo" with its overuse of Scandinavian accent made of "Yah" and "You betcha". This is the Coens' signature and it doesn't limit to dialogs but goes to the soundtrack and from the title to the score, you have the hillbilly thing screaming all over the place. Till today, it's impossible not to hear "Raising Arizona" without having that fast-paced upbeat banjo music and catchy yodel that makes you want to escape from whatever makes your routine. You got it, "Raising Arizona" is pure entertaining escapism, with a man and a woman giving their life a meaning the wrong way, before learning the lessons, the hard way. And what a lesson! the conclusion of the film is probably the most insightful and beautiful thing ever put in a film, transcending the limits of comedies to something that cuts straight to your heart. And by the way, I couldn't believe Roger Ebert's review, my only guess he didn't have enough perspective and he probably changed his mind after. But thanks to Ebert, I learned the definition of a good movie, from Howard Hawks' quote. It's made of three good scenes and no bad scenes. There are none in "Raising Arizona" and there are three mesmerizing sequences: one of the most promising and funny introductions ever, then the market scene that reinvents the foot-chase forever, and made it deeply intertwined with hillbilly yodel like banjo music did for "Bonnie and Clyde", and ten you have one of the most poignant and meaningful monologues ever. There are three great moments in "Raising Arizona", in the beginning, the middle and the ending, and if only for these moments, with so many laughs in-between, "Raising Arizona" is one of the greatest comedies ever  or my IMDb user name isn't ElMaruecan82.

    The Coen Brothers have made many great films and worked in many different genres. One of their most famous comedies is Raising Arizona, a fast paced, zany comedy that can only come from the minds of the Coens. H.I. "Hi" McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) is a career criminal who falls for policewoman Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter) and goes straight for her. After they get married they attempt to have a child, but when Ed finds out she is infertile and the pair unable to adopt the couple take the logically route of kidnapping a baby from a wealthy couple who have just had quintuplets. But their actions get complicated by two escaped convicted, a police investigation and a ruthless bounty hunter. Raising Arizona is a very funny comedy that zips along at a great pace. The Coens' fingerprints are all over this film, having a sharply written script and excellent direction throughout. The jokes are constant throughout the film, giving us a variety of style of humour, from great one-liners, character interactions and pure physical comedy. The Coens bring a lot of energy to the film as we get over the top set pieces like the robbery where Ed abandons Hi and the Coens being a brings a kinetic style with their camera movements and editing of set pieces. We get a great prologue at the beginning of the film as we find out about Hi and Ed's past and how they came to their solution with funny jokes on the way. As well as the direction, Raising Arizona is blessed with a top cast who give both comic and sincere performances. Cage and Hunter had great chemistry together, having excellent comic time and were committed to their roles. Cage worked well with his supporting cast as they assemble a top cast: John Goodman being a particular highlight as one of the escaped prisoners. The Coens Brothers' direction is frantic through the film, using fast paced editing, hand-held cameras and tracking shots, amplifying the comedy, showing this maniac universe and gives Raising Arizona a distinctive visual style. The Coen's regular composer Carter Burwell also supplies a great score for the film, particular the use of a country/folk like guitar score which was a perfect fit for the film. Raising Arizona is a very entertaining, funny and heartfelt comedy that can stand along some of the best works the Coen Brothers have had to offer. It is a screwball comedy that can cater to many tests from intelligent jokes, observations and character interactions, to more over the top physical and visual comedy.

    Honestly, I did not expect even the first Cohen brothers films to be really good. This one definitely is worth watching because the seriousness with which Cohen brothers make frivolous movies is best and this time. Busy throughout the film to make the foreground absurd or to the characters or to the situations in which they fall in, the two filmmakers get us into the world of attracting of opposites. Line from the movie, which can serve as an example here would be: "If a frog had wings, it would hardly hitting the legs into the body when jumping." In equally absurd way arises the love between a young policewoman and obsessive in robberies of shops criminal (collection of fools, as they point themselves). As she turns frigid, they decide to steal a child from a newly born five twins. And thus began the mess that does not stop until the end. The film is ideal for detente and kicking a bad mood and driving a good one.

    Raising Arizona is easily one of the funniest,greatest and most original Comedies of all time and a timeless film classic. Filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a wonderful screenplay,truly beautiful cinematography and an unforgettable score,Raising Arizona is The Coen Brothers at their best and greatest. Raising Arizona tells the story of H.I. McDunnough(Nicholas Cage),a criminal and repeat offender and police officer 'Ed' Edwina(Holly Hunter)who fall in love and after falling in love decide to get married and have kids. When H.I. and Ed can't conceive kids of their own,H.I and Ed kidnap a quintuplet,Nathan Arizona JR(T.J Kuhn JR) one of the children of local business man Nathan Arizona(Trey Wilson). When H.I and Ed take Nathan J.r and want to raise him as their own wild and hilarious things happen in their lives. Raising Arizona is one of the all-time great classic Comedies from The Coen Brothers that came after their amazing film debut Blood Simple. When filmmakers have a first film that is so acclaimed and well loved, most filmmakers have to do a second film that lives up to the quality of their first film and not only does Raising Arizona live up to Blood Simple but also gives viewers and brilliant and much lighter cinematic experience. One of the reasons Raising Arizona is excellent and truly hilarious is because The Coen Brothers have given us a flawless film that combines great laughs with style and substance where everything in the film is over the top and exaggerated to the point of going over the top beyond belief. The laughs and humor in the film are funny,ingenious and original with hilarious Slapstick Comedy,funny dialog and moments in the movie that have you laughing until your stomach hurts and will have tears running down your face. The laughs are so crazy and over the top you will you're watching a surreal live Action Cartoon. What is also great about the Humor in this film and other Coen Brother films is that the laughs are subtle and used in visuals and imagery that are not obvious the first time you watch RA but when you watch the film with multiple viewings you will notice or catch some of the visual jokes of the film. And speaking of of visuals RA is one of the most beautiful and visually stunning Comedies I have ever seen. Barry Sonnefield's photography is amazing and powerful with wide angle shots,close ups and shots of the sunlight,road and dusty world of Arizona. Sonnefield's photography gives the film a surreal and wild energy that you don't see in most comedies and that is one of the great things that set RZ apart from other films of it's type because RA can have wonderful style but also a great substance. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is hilarious and well and one of the best screenplays in Comedy history with the Coens giving the main great dialog that is funny,memorable and stylized as well as greatly using narration for H.I. McDunnough and lines from the main characters that are quotable and will stay in your mind. The two main characters H.I. and Ed McDunnough while over the top and are cartoon characters who are funny but are given great depth and humanity and you feel like the two truly love and care for one another and even though H.I and Ed kidnapped a baby they don't do for fame or money,they do it because they want to be parents and want to love a child and the kidnapping make the main characters more complex than they truly are and that is one of things that great about RA and the Coens. Although not an Action film RA has a couple of good Action and chase scenes that are thrilling and exciting. Especially the film's main chase scene which is one of the funniest,wildest,original and over the top chase scenes in film history and it is a classic chase that that you will never forget. The ending of the film is funny,beautiful and very optimistic and will make you wonder what will happen to H.I and ED. An great ending to a great film. The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Nicholas Cage is brilliant,funny and at his best as H.I McDunnough,with Cage bringing laughs and depth to the role. Holly Hunter is excellent as 'Ed' Edwina McDunnough,with Hunter feisty and funny and having great chemistry with Cage. Trey Wilson is wonderful and fun as Nathan Arizona,a local business man. John Goodman and William Forsythe are great,funny and over the top as Gale and Evelle Snoats,escaped convicts who are H.I's friends. Sam McMurray and Francis McDormand are amazing and hilarious as husband and wife Glen and Dot,friends of H.I. and Ed. Randell 'Tex' Cobb is fantastic as Leonard Smalls,a man hunter who's a man of few words and is looking for Nathan JR. The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is excellent,with The Coens always moving the camera,using wide angles,low angles,close-ups and giving the film a great visual style. Great direction by The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is is amazing,funny,beautiful and very quirky and matches the tone of the film,with Burwell greatly mixing whistles,yodeling,organs and banjos. Wonderful score by Burwell. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you check out Raising Arizona,a truly hilarious,funny and unforgettable Comedy and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I adore this one. I'll have you know it is my 'feelgood' movie, having seen it now a dozen times it never fails to lift my spirits. After some deliberation, I am finally putting it on my list of must see films. What the Coens have done here is a very delicate thing. The obvious first. What you see in the film is both 'real', a loving trailer trash couple cannot conceive a child, and sleepless bending of reality as the urge to steal one so they can finally have a 'full family unit' manifests around them in all sorts of crazy situations. The biker from Hell is the tip of the thread, first dreamed about and in a weird confluence of forces soon appears in reality as dreamed. From that point on, everything is askew while pointing to anxious dreaming. Prison pals from HI's criminal past show up in the middle of the night. The frantic hunt for Huggies, starting with another botched holdup. HI's boss as the dreary dead-end of family life. More obvious, the business with the hole in the ground. It isn't simply surreal, a term normally associated with vaguely weird stream-of-consciousness. It's film noir, the film is sandwiched after all between the much more openly noirish Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. The Coens get noir, where the desire for life to be other/better than it is (not for sex or money as in noir, but blissful family life here personified in the baby) causes peculiar whims in perception, and those whims mysteriously manifest in the narrator's 'choosing' of the reality he remembers, collapsing in the process. Noir is magical, alluring to this day, because all those things are causally inextricable, desire from dream or memory from mysterious happenings in the story, which is why we often collapse the whole knotted mess to the workings of some celestial fate. There's all sorts of stuff woven on top. Reagan's morning in America as neurotic hyper-normalcy, the bum HI as the flipside of that, laid-back and tied to the American tradition of glorified frontiersmen and criminals, lampooned in the biker. 1980's suburbia as consumerist limbo. It's a helluva ride. Next to Blue Velvet and Society, the definitive 1980's film. It does all sort of collapse together by the end, which supports and enhances the idea of the random , whimsical arising of dreams. Big Lebowski starts here. Its charm? You can 'get' this without 'getting' it. The whole Huggies sequence is as profound to me as any cinematic dream. But it isn't like Tarkovksy who bypasses the mind by long mystifying sweeps, hitting deep in this way. It strikes an amazing balance between self-conscious intelligent conception and the bypass in spontaneous asides of fun and tremendous heartHI and Ed (the lovely Holly Hunter) are one of the most loving couples in filmdom. Intelligence, fun and emotion, these three are inextricable. This being so, you can 'get' the film via any route. It ends with an Ozzie and Harriet movie dream of the perfect life.

    Criminal Herbert I. "Hi" (Nicolas Cage) after his continued visits to a prison happens to marry Edwina "Ed" after his latest release from prison. Soon the couple discovers that Ed is not fit to be a mother and are unable to adopt a baby due to Ed's Criminal record. So they decide to kidnap one of the Quints of a local furniture magnate "Nathan Arizona" believing it to be Nathan Jr. Problems arouse as Hi is visited by his prison buddies and he thinks of returning to his notorious lifestyle along with his supervisor discovering that kid is not his after he made an unsuccessful wife swapping offer to him. Matters get worse as a bounty hunter named Leo Smalls gets in search of Nathan Jr. to sell him in the market and Hi's buddies taking undue advantage of junior's identity. Do watch this early Coen Bros. movie because of some great comic scenes especially the scene where Hi steals a pack of diapers and it is one of those movies that gives us the insight into the kind of characters the duo generates, dialogues they write and unconventional music score that became symbolic for their future movies. MY RATING: 9/10

    The Importance of Theme in Raising Arizona

    The film Raising Arizona begins with the unfortunate life of H.I. McDunnough (Nicholas Cage) and his journeys in and out of prison where he meets his future wife, Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter), a corrections officer. The two get married and discover that they cannot have children of their own, despite their beliefs that they are good people and would make great parents. Around that time, Nathan and Florence Arizona (Trey Wilson and Lynne Kitei) give birth to quintuplets, and discover that so many children are "more than they can handle!" The McDunnoughs, with their good intentions in hand, kidnap one of the quintuplets to raise as their own, believing that they are doing the Arizona's a favor. The primary theme of this film is the effects of karma, or the idea that "what goes around comes around." This theme can be found throughout the film, as characters like Gale and Evelle Snoats (John Goodman and William Forsythe) fail in their attempt to rob a bank and eventually return to jail. The theme can also be found through the consequences that the McDunnoughs face as a result of the kidnapping, and the reactions of Nathan Arizona when he finally learns what has happened to his son. The primary tool used to explain the theme of the film is the voice-over. A voice-over can be used to fill in gaps and make a film cohesive, or to explain background or contextual information to the viewer (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). In Raising Arizona, the voice-over is used for both reasons, and gives thorough insights into the thoughts and motives of the characters. This tool is very effective in conveying the theme of the film in that sense. The acting throughout the film is also very effective in helping to convey the theme of the film. H.I. is a very innocent character, despite his many crimes, and the acting portrays this well. Ed is another na&iuml;ve character, who does not fully understand the consequences of her actions. As both of these characters begin to realize the consequences of their actions, they begin to take responsibility for them and try to do what is best for everyone. In that sense, both actors help to contribute to the theme of the film by effectively displaying the emotions and motivations of their characters. The theme of this film is similar to the themes of many other films, like, for example, the film Elf, where the primary character, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell), acts on his good intentions, even when his actions may not be the right thing to do. For example, in one scene, Buddy gets in a fight with a store "Santa" (Artie Lange) because Buddy knows that the man is an imposter. The message of this film is very important to everyone, because good intentions are very important, but it is still important that one always tries to do what is right. Though they may have started off on the wrong path, Ed and H.I. finally make amends and do what is right for everyone involved in the situation. References Boggs, J. M. & Petrie, D. W. (2008).

    Raising Arizona is a film that follows the story of an unconventional couple; convict Hi (Cage) and police officer Ed (Hunter), as they attempt to find harmony and happiness in their lives together. However, their greatest obstacle is Ed's sterility that slowly wears on their relationship and threatens their sanity until opportunity arises in the form of a wealthy local whose wife births "more than she can handle". Accomplishing the abduction proves a bit difficult, but the rabid persistence of Ed drives their mission to success, and with the addition of this vital piece, it seems a true family is born. Unfortunately, prying and obnoxious colleagues, mischievous jailbirds/buddies, and a gritty detective with a Harley threaten their happiness, but also demonstrate how misguided and selfish their actions have been. Returning the baby to an appreciative and surprisingly sympathetic father, Hi reflects on the affection we have for children, even if they're not our own and is able to sleep peacefully with dreams for the future that he hopes holds a family of his very own. I generally appreciate the Coen Brother's films and what I appreciate most is their ability to hold interest of the audience through plot twists and strong characters; there's nothing extreme or very showy about their work and yet it stands out because there is only ever and illusion of normalcy and sanity in their characters or the plot, really the work is quite complex but we appreciate it more because they make no pretense. Raising Arizona continues this tradition and also has quite a flavor of Americana, enhanced greatly by the colorful characters. The humor was ludicrous most times, but it was balanced through the sensitive and reflective nature of the protagonist, whose broodings lend itself to the underlying sense of loneliness and hopelessness of the characters and the landscape and drive the rich plot forward. I feel that any criticism would simply be void for two reasons: I believe that this film is very stylistic and I don't believe that they ventured out of this particular structure, any risk they took (including the dream sequences) had basis in reality and only served to give the film more poetic flavor, and secondly, I believe that the film was unique and heartfelt among it's genre, which at times is difficult to achieve in something externally so seemingly detached as comedy, and mainly, I think there was valid reasoning behind it's creation, which is my only objection with modern film. The cinematography of the film was very interesting and was able to keep the audience occupied by the sheer amount of stimulation the wild camera movements brought. I was able to appreciate the shaky camera work simply because I think it does justice to Hi's convict past as well as his current lifestyle, punctuated by his most daring criminal offense yet. This apparently dramatic and brutal world is something that few of us can sympathize with and I think the long takes through several different environments contributes to that foreign aspect of the film that quite frankly makes it hilarious. Motifs in the film include the joined hands of Hi and Ed, representing their bond and their support of each other, the fire that erupts from the detective, representing his nature, and the convenient store that represents Hi's temptation or the pull of his old life. The brothers use this as well as a few non-diegetic inserts (including baby toys) to bring a bit of understanding to the rapidly moving plot, but it is interesting to note that this veers a bit from the slapstick genre that is quite shallow and brings a poetic aspect to the film. In the abduction scene the use of high-angle and low-angle shots capture flawlessly both the perspective of Hi and of the babies and the power shift that takes place between them, succeeding in making Hi seem vulnerable among these small creatures. Also, throughout the entire film the use of the wide-angle lens is used, making people and surroundings seem distorted and often a bit out of proportion. The abduction scene demonstrates the use of this very well, especially when the babies are taking a very long time to reach the door and then the end of the hallway, giving Hi enough time to catch them before Mrs. Arizona discovers. This also contributes to the suspense of the scene, because everything seems to take longer to happen and Hi is running out of time to act. Off-screen action and voice is used quite a bit to stage a change in events in the plot and repetition of certain events forming a montage is comedic as well as clarity inducing. It really strikes both emotional stances quite well and makes for a heartfelt and poetic take on the slapstick comedy genre, aided by the strong narrative voice that guides us through a ridiculous and tragic journey of an unlikely couple trying to find the missing piece in their family.

    A quick checklist for anyone considering this movie: 1. Coenheads - if you are one, proceed to checkout 2. Hollow humorist - if you like to be force fed your humor, you're in luck. 3. Bicoastalism - plenty of middle/Southern/Western stereotypes here 4. Amateur Auteurs - Watch this film so you can earn your "I'm-more- sophisticated-than-you" pin. All others should bypass this cinematic desert. It has been said that much art is devised to impress other artists. I think that attitude is central to Coeney Island, and this film certainly falls into the category euphemistically called "quirky". Products such as this can't be blamed for aiming squarely at their intended audience. If you like this kind of pseudo-intellectual fare, bully for you. There are plenty of vendors for this kind of ware. All others who will try to find anything substantial will be sorely disappointed. You won't experience wildness, depth, sentiment, wonder, fury, intrigue, edginess, insight, lasciviousness, or even a good joke. In fact, what's really missing is honesty. You will be served up mounds of pretense and self-important contrivance, infused with long-expired sophomorism, and powdered with clip art humanism. Package above with ,uh, quirky dialogue (hard to assign that term since the characters don't express anything to each other or the audience) and you have all the haughty form-over-substance. cookie-cutter originality that the anesthetized soul craves. It was finely-crafted bubble-wrap, I admit that.

    Raising Arizona is a not-so-funny comedy surrounding the marriage and infertility of ex-cop, Ed McDonnough (Holly Hunter) and her ex-con husband, H.I. (Nicolas Cage). When the couple is told by her doctor that they would not be able to conceive a child of their own, Ed is devastated. While watching television one evening, the couple sees that Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), a rich, furniture store owner and his wife were now the proud parents of quintuplets. Ed concocts a plan to "borrow" one of their babies because she believes they "have their hands full" with 5 babies. This in turn sets off a crazy string of events which leave the couple in a fight for their "borrowed" child, their freedom and their love for one another. The theme of Raising Arizona is a character's struggle within themselves to soothe the constant "wants" in life that are not necessarily needed. Throughout the movie, Ed just wants to be happy. Before marrying H.I., she just wanted to meet the right man and get married. During one scene when Ed is booking H.I. into one of his many jail stints, she is sobbing because her then fianc&eacute;' had broken up with her. This was the first time that Ed realized that she had feelings for H.I., when he showed compassion for her and told her that her fianc&eacute;' had to be stupid to leave her. Soon after, Ed and H.I. were married and she immediately wanted to start having babies. This proved to be impossible for them and her desperate "want" to be a mother caused her to grow depressed, lose interest in everything - including cleaning her house and she lost her job. H.I. just seems to be along for the crazy ride. The wild story line and almost unfathomable shenanigans in this movie are somewhat similar to the 1990 Dennis Dugan movie, Problem Child, starring John Ritter. In both movies, there are couples who desperately want to have a child and when they are both given what they want it proves to be much more than they can handle. Both movies are filled with conflict and chaos right up to the very end. The motifs and camera angles brought out the theme of this movie and made it more exciting to watch. Throughout the movie the viewer is constantly reminded that Ed wants a baby and after Baby Arizona is "borrowed", the camera is fixated on how Ed and H.I. plan to keep him and keep their secret. The camera techniques were great in this movie. There were several parallel cuts that took the viewer back and forth between two different locations as the suspense was rising. In one particular scene, Ed, H.I. and Baby Jr. are driving home from spending a day with friends and they pull into a store to pick up some diapers. H.I. is tempted to resort to his old ways and ends up robbing the store. Ed sees him through the window and immediately becomes angry and drives away, leaving him to fend for himself. What H.I. doesn't anticipate though, is the store clerk is ready for him. After pushing an emergency button to alert the authorities, the clerk pulls out a rifle and starts shooting at H.I. Just as he is running away the cops pull up and start a wild chase. The cameras cut back and forth between H.I. running through streets, yards and houses, the cops chasing him and Ed, who had a change of heart about leaving him and decides to go back and try to help save him from the police. All of the chaos and goofy humor combined with a crazy plot take the viewer right back to the theme of the movie, choose your "wants" lightly because they just might turn out to be your "want nots".

    You've gotta hand it to the Coen brothers, they sure know how to inject style and flamboyance in their creations. And to think that "Raising Arizona" was only their second feature film makes the accomplishment even more impressive although "Blood Simple." was powerful enough an announcement of two upcoming talents threatening to shake Hollywood's conventions with a unique sense of eccentricity, and human depth. "Blood Simple." was still borrowing some elements from film-noir and Hitchcock movies, and, no matter how effective it was, it could have easily been targeted as an exercise in style. This is why the Coen brothers couldn't have made a better choice by making a zany comedy with a tender and more optimistic tone. And not only the film works but "Raising Arizona" is now a comedy classic, so special that it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath than 80's comedies for the simple reason that it differs from what was made in that decade. And that's the thing about the Coen brothers, they make timeless films, set in universes, playing like crossroads between fantasy and reality, where their stories float with a bizarre but so penetrating poetry. I know this is a Coen brothers' so we're tempted to get deeper on the subject. Granted it's not just a story about two people who kidnap a baby because they can't have one, there are far more symbolism and philosophical material lying underneath the screwball carapace, but how about enjoying the film for what it is: one hilarious piece of cinematic greatness carried by the kind of colorful cast that made the Coen's films so lively. And what a cast! Nicolas Cage is H.I. aka "Hi" McDunnough, a multiple recidivist specialized in robbing market stores and Holly Hunter is Edwina aka 'Ed', the photographer who took so many mug shots she ended up proving that indeed, opposites attracted. But the Coen brothers are not the type of directors to comfortably sit on the presence of two solid protagonist, they know supporting characters are the spices that give the film its flavor. So, we have the two escaped prison buddies, two brothers played by two Johns, John Goodman, who'd become one of the Coen's greatest asset with such a physical presence he'd steal the show anytime, anywhere and Forsythe as his dim-witted brother. There is Sam McMumurray as Glen, the bourgeois pain-in-the-ass and the late Trey Wilson as Nathan Arizona, father of cute blonde-haired quints, the furniture magnate whose motto consist on concluding all his statements with "or my name isn't Nathan Arizona". Each character illuminates the screen with a unique presence, even little Nathan Jr. makes you believe people would kill each other to get him, and Frances McDormand is given a less important play but plays it with the required over-the-top way you'd expect from the woman who chose a guy like Glen for husband. Speaking of Glen, nothing against Sam McMurray but I would have loved to see John Turturro playing his part, if only because it would have made "Raising Arizona"'s the consummate Coen brothers' film, with characters before stories. Hell, it goes even to the point where the most seemingly inoffensive market-cashier can tot a gunshot and become a Dirty Harry-like figure, no one is to be underestimated, not when laughs are at stakes. Naturally, such story deserves a worthy villain and this is where Randal 'Tex' Cobb makes his entrances, as a man coming from nowhere, supposedly incarnating the devil, whenever he goes, grass never grow back and this modern Atilla of biker of the apocalypse first emerges in HI's dream after he stole Nathan's kid. He symbolizes HI's conscience, something that will torment him until he finds the way to redeem himself, and this is the philosophical stuff hidden beneath the film, it's about characters doing morally wrong things, and finding their own path to redemption. When a recidivist teams up with a cop and both stole parents' fruits of love, you know this ain't the way to reach marital happiness. And the whole narrative is cooked up up in typical Mid-West accent, flirting with caricature but giving "Raising Arizona"its colorful spirit, the same as "Fargo" with its overuse of Scandinavian accent made of "Yah" and "You betcha". This is the Coens' signature and it doesn't limit to dialogs but goes to the soundtrack and from the title to the score, you have the hillbilly thing screaming all over the place. Till today, it's impossible not to hear "Raising Arizona" without having that fast-paced upbeat banjo music and catchy yodel that makes you want to escape from whatever makes your routine. You got it, "Raising Arizona" is pure entertaining escapism, with a man and a woman giving their life a meaning the wrong way, before learning the lessons, the hard way. And what a lesson! the conclusion of the film is probably the most insightful and beautiful thing ever put in a film, transcending the limits of comedies to something that cuts straight to your heart. And by the way, I couldn't believe Roger Ebert's review, my only guess he didn't have enough perspective and he probably changed his mind after. But thanks to Ebert, I learned the definition of a good movie, from Howard Hawks' quote. It's made of three good scenes and no bad scenes. There are none in "Raising Arizona" and there are three mesmerizing sequences: one of the most promising and funny introductions ever, then the market scene that reinvents the foot-chase forever, and made it deeply intertwined with hillbilly yodel like banjo music did for "Bonnie and Clyde", and ten you have one of the most poignant and meaningful monologues ever. There are three great moments in "Raising Arizona", in the beginning, the middle and the ending, and if only for these moments, with so many laughs in-between, "Raising Arizona" is one of the greatest comedies ever  or my IMDb user name isn't ElMaruecan82.

    The Coen Brothers have made many great films and worked in many different genres. One of their most famous comedies is Raising Arizona, a fast paced, zany comedy that can only come from the minds of the Coens. H.I. "Hi" McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) is a career criminal who falls for policewoman Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter) and goes straight for her. After they get married they attempt to have a child, but when Ed finds out she is infertile and the pair unable to adopt the couple take the logically route of kidnapping a baby from a wealthy couple who have just had quintuplets. But their actions get complicated by two escaped convicted, a police investigation and a ruthless bounty hunter. Raising Arizona is a very funny comedy that zips along at a great pace. The Coens' fingerprints are all over this film, having a sharply written script and excellent direction throughout. The jokes are constant throughout the film, giving us a variety of style of humour, from great one-liners, character interactions and pure physical comedy. The Coens bring a lot of energy to the film as we get over the top set pieces like the robbery where Ed abandons Hi and the Coens being a brings a kinetic style with their camera movements and editing of set pieces. We get a great prologue at the beginning of the film as we find out about Hi and Ed's past and how they came to their solution with funny jokes on the way. As well as the direction, Raising Arizona is blessed with a top cast who give both comic and sincere performances. Cage and Hunter had great chemistry together, having excellent comic time and were committed to their roles. Cage worked well with his supporting cast as they assemble a top cast: John Goodman being a particular highlight as one of the escaped prisoners. The Coens Brothers' direction is frantic through the film, using fast paced editing, hand-held cameras and tracking shots, amplifying the comedy, showing this maniac universe and gives Raising Arizona a distinctive visual style. The Coen's regular composer Carter Burwell also supplies a great score for the film, particular the use of a country/folk like guitar score which was a perfect fit for the film. Raising Arizona is a very entertaining, funny and heartfelt comedy that can stand along some of the best works the Coen Brothers have had to offer. It is a screwball comedy that can cater to many tests from intelligent jokes, observations and character interactions, to more over the top physical and visual comedy.

    Honestly, I did not expect even the first Cohen brothers films to be really good. This one definitely is worth watching because the seriousness with which Cohen brothers make frivolous movies is best and this time. Busy throughout the film to make the foreground absurd or to the characters or to the situations in which they fall in, the two filmmakers get us into the world of attracting of opposites. Line from the movie, which can serve as an example here would be: "If a frog had wings, it would hardly hitting the legs into the body when jumping." In equally absurd way arises the love between a young policewoman and obsessive in robberies of shops criminal (collection of fools, as they point themselves). As she turns frigid, they decide to steal a child from a newly born five twins. And thus began the mess that does not stop until the end. The film is ideal for detente and kicking a bad mood and driving a good one.

    Raising Arizona is easily one of the funniest,greatest and most original Comedies of all time and a timeless film classic. Filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a wonderful screenplay,truly beautiful cinematography and an unforgettable score,Raising Arizona is The Coen Brothers at their best and greatest. Raising Arizona tells the story of H.I. McDunnough(Nicholas Cage),a criminal and repeat offender and police officer 'Ed' Edwina(Holly Hunter)who fall in love and after falling in love decide to get married and have kids. When H.I. and Ed can't conceive kids of their own,H.I and Ed kidnap a quintuplet,Nathan Arizona JR(T.J Kuhn JR) one of the children of local business man Nathan Arizona(Trey Wilson). When H.I and Ed take Nathan J.r and want to raise him as their own wild and hilarious things happen in their lives. Raising Arizona is one of the all-time great classic Comedies from The Coen Brothers that came after their amazing film debut Blood Simple. When filmmakers have a first film that is so acclaimed and well loved, most filmmakers have to do a second film that lives up to the quality of their first film and not only does Raising Arizona live up to Blood Simple but also gives viewers and brilliant and much lighter cinematic experience. One of the reasons Raising Arizona is excellent and truly hilarious is because The Coen Brothers have given us a flawless film that combines great laughs with style and substance where everything in the film is over the top and exaggerated to the point of going over the top beyond belief. The laughs and humor in the film are funny,ingenious and original with hilarious Slapstick Comedy,funny dialog and moments in the movie that have you laughing until your stomach hurts and will have tears running down your face. The laughs are so crazy and over the top you will you're watching a surreal live Action Cartoon. What is also great about the Humor in this film and other Coen Brother films is that the laughs are subtle and used in visuals and imagery that are not obvious the first time you watch RA but when you watch the film with multiple viewings you will notice or catch some of the visual jokes of the film. And speaking of of visuals RA is one of the most beautiful and visually stunning Comedies I have ever seen. Barry Sonnefield's photography is amazing and powerful with wide angle shots,close ups and shots of the sunlight,road and dusty world of Arizona. Sonnefield's photography gives the film a surreal and wild energy that you don't see in most comedies and that is one of the great things that set RZ apart from other films of it's type because RA can have wonderful style but also a great substance. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is hilarious and well and one of the best screenplays in Comedy history with the Coens giving the main great dialog that is funny,memorable and stylized as well as greatly using narration for H.I. McDunnough and lines from the main characters that are quotable and will stay in your mind. The two main characters H.I. and Ed McDunnough while over the top and are cartoon characters who are funny but are given great depth and humanity and you feel like the two truly love and care for one another and even though H.I and Ed kidnapped a baby they don't do for fame or money,they do it because they want to be parents and want to love a child and the kidnapping make the main characters more complex than they truly are and that is one of things that great about RA and the Coens. Although not an Action film RA has a couple of good Action and chase scenes that are thrilling and exciting. Especially the film's main chase scene which is one of the funniest,wildest,original and over the top chase scenes in film history and it is a classic chase that that you will never forget. The ending of the film is funny,beautiful and very optimistic and will make you wonder what will happen to H.I and ED. An great ending to a great film. The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Nicholas Cage is brilliant,funny and at his best as H.I McDunnough,with Cage bringing laughs and depth to the role. Holly Hunter is excellent as 'Ed' Edwina McDunnough,with Hunter feisty and funny and having great chemistry with Cage. Trey Wilson is wonderful and fun as Nathan Arizona,a local business man. John Goodman and William Forsythe are great,funny and over the top as Gale and Evelle Snoats,escaped convicts who are H.I's friends. Sam McMurray and Francis McDormand are amazing and hilarious as husband and wife Glen and Dot,friends of H.I. and Ed. Randell 'Tex' Cobb is fantastic as Leonard Smalls,a man hunter who's a man of few words and is looking for Nathan JR. The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is excellent,with The Coens always moving the camera,using wide angles,low angles,close-ups and giving the film a great visual style. Great direction by The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is is amazing,funny,beautiful and very quirky and matches the tone of the film,with Burwell greatly mixing whistles,yodeling,organs and banjos. Wonderful score by Burwell. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you check out Raising Arizona,a truly hilarious,funny and unforgettable Comedy and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I adore this one. I'll have you know it is my 'feelgood' movie, having seen it now a dozen times it never fails to lift my spirits. After some deliberation, I am finally putting it on my list of must see films. What the Coens have done here is a very delicate thing. The obvious first. What you see in the film is both 'real', a loving trailer trash couple cannot conceive a child, and sleepless bending of reality as the urge to steal one so they can finally have a 'full family unit' manifests around them in all sorts of crazy situations. The biker from Hell is the tip of the thread, first dreamed about and in a weird confluence of forces soon appears in reality as dreamed. From that point on, everything is askew while pointing to anxious dreaming. Prison pals from HI's criminal past show up in the middle of the night. The frantic hunt for Huggies, starting with another botched holdup. HI's boss as the dreary dead-end of family life. More obvious, the business with the hole in the ground. It isn't simply surreal, a term normally associated with vaguely weird stream-of-consciousness. It's film noir, the film is sandwiched after all between the much more openly noirish Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. The Coens get noir, where the desire for life to be other/better than it is (not for sex or money as in noir, but blissful family life here personified in the baby) causes peculiar whims in perception, and those whims mysteriously manifest in the narrator's 'choosing' of the reality he remembers, collapsing in the process. Noir is magical, alluring to this day, because all those things are causally inextricable, desire from dream or memory from mysterious happenings in the story, which is why we often collapse the whole knotted mess to the workings of some celestial fate. There's all sorts of stuff woven on top. Reagan's morning in America as neurotic hyper-normalcy, the bum HI as the flipside of that, laid-back and tied to the American tradition of glorified frontiersmen and criminals, lampooned in the biker. 1980's suburbia as consumerist limbo. It's a helluva ride. Next to Blue Velvet and Society, the definitive 1980's film. It does all sort of collapse together by the end, which supports and enhances the idea of the random , whimsical arising of dreams. Big Lebowski starts here. Its charm? You can 'get' this without 'getting' it. The whole Huggies sequence is as profound to me as any cinematic dream. But it isn't like Tarkovksy who bypasses the mind by long mystifying sweeps, hitting deep in this way. It strikes an amazing balance between self-conscious intelligent conception and the bypass in spontaneous asides of fun and tremendous heartHI and Ed (the lovely Holly Hunter) are one of the most loving couples in filmdom. Intelligence, fun and emotion, these three are inextricable. This being so, you can 'get' the film via any route. It ends with an Ozzie and Harriet movie dream of the perfect life.

    Criminal Herbert I. "Hi" (Nicolas Cage) after his continued visits to a prison happens to marry Edwina "Ed" after his latest release from prison. Soon the couple discovers that Ed is not fit to be a mother and are unable to adopt a baby due to Ed's Criminal record. So they decide to kidnap one of the Quints of a local furniture magnate "Nathan Arizona" believing it to be Nathan Jr. Problems arouse as Hi is visited by his prison buddies and he thinks of returning to his notorious lifestyle along with his supervisor discovering that kid is not his after he made an unsuccessful wife swapping offer to him. Matters get worse as a bounty hunter named Leo Smalls gets in search of Nathan Jr. to sell him in the market and Hi's buddies taking undue advantage of junior's identity. Do watch this early Coen Bros. movie because of some great comic scenes especially the scene where Hi steals a pack of diapers and it is one of those movies that gives us the insight into the kind of characters the duo generates, dialogues they write and unconventional music score that became symbolic for their future movies. MY RATING: 9/10

    The film Raising Arizona begins with the unfortunate life of H.I. McDunnough (Nicholas Cage) and his journeys in and out of prison where he meets his future wife, Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter), a corrections officer. The two get married and discover that they cannot have children of their own, despite their beliefs that they are good people and would make great parents. Around that time, Nathan and Florence Arizona (Trey Wilson and Lynne Kitei) give birth to quintuplets, and discover that so many children are "more than they can handle!" The McDunnoughs, with their good intentions in hand, kidnap one of the quintuplets to raise as their own, believing that they are doing the Arizona's a favor. The primary theme of this film is the effects of karma, or the idea that "what goes around comes around." This theme can be found throughout the film, as characters like Gale and Evelle Snoats (John Goodman and William Forsythe) fail in their attempt to rob a bank and eventually return to jail. The theme can also be found through the consequences that the McDunnoughs face as a result of the kidnapping, and the reactions of Nathan Arizona when he finally learns what has happened to his son. The primary tool used to explain the theme of the film is the voice-over. A voice-over can be used to fill in gaps and make a film cohesive, or to explain background or contextual information to the viewer (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). In Raising Arizona, the voice-over is used for both reasons, and gives thorough insights into the thoughts and motives of the characters. This tool is very effective in conveying the theme of the film in that sense. The acting throughout the film is also very effective in helping to convey the theme of the film. H.I. is a very innocent character, despite his many crimes, and the acting portrays this well. Ed is another na&iuml;ve character, who does not fully understand the consequences of her actions. As both of these characters begin to realize the consequences of their actions, they begin to take responsibility for them and try to do what is best for everyone. In that sense, both actors help to contribute to the theme of the film by effectively displaying the emotions and motivations of their characters. The theme of this film is similar to the themes of many other films, like, for example, the film Elf, where the primary character, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell), acts on his good intentions, even when his actions may not be the right thing to do. For example, in one scene, Buddy gets in a fight with a store "Santa" (Artie Lange) because Buddy knows that the man is an imposter. The message of this film is very important to everyone, because good intentions are very important, but it is still important that one always tries to do what is right. Though they may have started off on the wrong path, Ed and H.I. finally make amends and do what is right for everyone involved in the situation. References Boggs, J. M. & Petrie, D. W. (2008).

    Raising Arizona is a film that follows the story of an unconventional couple; convict Hi (Cage) and police officer Ed (Hunter), as they attempt to find harmony and happiness in their lives together. However, their greatest obstacle is Ed's sterility that slowly wears on their relationship and threatens their sanity until opportunity arises in the form of a wealthy local whose wife births "more than she can handle". Accomplishing the abduction proves a bit difficult, but the rabid persistence of Ed drives their mission to success, and with the addition of this vital piece, it seems a true family is born. Unfortunately, prying and obnoxious colleagues, mischievous jailbirds/buddies, and a gritty detective with a Harley threaten their happiness, but also demonstrate how misguided and selfish their actions have been. Returning the baby to an appreciative and surprisingly sympathetic father, Hi reflects on the affection we have for children, even if they're not our own and is able to sleep peacefully with dreams for the future that he hopes holds a family of his very own. I generally appreciate the Coen Brother's films and what I appreciate most is their ability to hold interest of the audience through plot twists and strong characters; there's nothing extreme or very showy about their work and yet it stands out because there is only ever and illusion of normalcy and sanity in their characters or the plot, really the work is quite complex but we appreciate it more because they make no pretense. Raising Arizona continues this tradition and also has quite a flavor of Americana, enhanced greatly by the colorful characters. The humor was ludicrous most times, but it was balanced through the sensitive and reflective nature of the protagonist, whose broodings lend itself to the underlying sense of loneliness and hopelessness of the characters and the landscape and drive the rich plot forward. I feel that any criticism would simply be void for two reasons: I believe that this film is very stylistic and I don't believe that they ventured out of this particular structure, any risk they took (including the dream sequences) had basis in reality and only served to give the film more poetic flavor, and secondly, I believe that the film was unique and heartfelt among it's genre, which at times is difficult to achieve in something externally so seemingly detached as comedy, and mainly, I think there was valid reasoning behind it's creation, which is my only objection with modern film. The cinematography of the film was very interesting and was able to keep the audience occupied by the sheer amount of stimulation the wild camera movements brought. I was able to appreciate the shaky camera work simply because I think it does justice to Hi's convict past as well as his current lifestyle, punctuated by his most daring criminal offense yet. This apparently dramatic and brutal world is something that few of us can sympathize with and I think the long takes through several different environments contributes to that foreign aspect of the film that quite frankly makes it hilarious. Motifs in the film include the joined hands of Hi and Ed, representing their bond and their support of each other, the fire that erupts from the detective, representing his nature, and the convenient store that represents Hi's temptation or the pull of his old life. The brothers use this as well as a few non-diegetic inserts (including baby toys) to bring a bit of understanding to the rapidly moving plot, but it is interesting to note that this veers a bit from the slapstick genre that is quite shallow and brings a poetic aspect to the film. In the abduction scene the use of high-angle and low-angle shots capture flawlessly both the perspective of Hi and of the babies and the power shift that takes place between them, succeeding in making Hi seem vulnerable among these small creatures. Also, throughout the entire film the use of the wide-angle lens is used, making people and surroundings seem distorted and often a bit out of proportion. The abduction scene demonstrates the use of this very well, especially when the babies are taking a very long time to reach the door and then the end of the hallway, giving Hi enough time to catch them before Mrs. Arizona discovers. This also contributes to the suspense of the scene, because everything seems to take longer to happen and Hi is running out of time to act. Off-screen action and voice is used quite a bit to stage a change in events in the plot and repetition of certain events forming a montage is comedic as well as clarity inducing. It really strikes both emotional stances quite well and makes for a heartfelt and poetic take on the slapstick comedy genre, aided by the strong narrative voice that guides us through a ridiculous and tragic journey of an unlikely couple trying to find the missing piece in their family.

    A quick checklist for anyone considering this movie: 1. Coenheads - if you are one, proceed to checkout 2. Hollow humorist - if you like to be force fed your humor, you're in luck. 3. Bicoastalism - plenty of middle/Southern/Western stereotypes here 4. Amateur Auteurs - Watch this film so you can earn your "I'm-more- sophisticated-than-you" pin. All others should bypass this cinematic desert. It has been said that much art is devised to impress other artists. I think that attitude is central to Coeney Island, and this film certainly falls into the category euphemistically called "quirky". Products such as this can't be blamed for aiming squarely at their intended audience. If you like this kind of pseudo-intellectual fare, bully for you. There are plenty of vendors for this kind of ware. All others who will try to find anything substantial will be sorely disappointed. You won't experience wildness, depth, sentiment, wonder, fury, intrigue, edginess, insight, lasciviousness, or even a good joke. In fact, what's really missing is honesty. You will be served up mounds of pretense and self-important contrivance, infused with long-expired sophomorism, and powdered with clip art humanism. Package above with ,uh, quirky dialogue (hard to assign that term since the characters don't express anything to each other or the audience) and you have all the haughty form-over-substance. cookie-cutter originality that the anesthetized soul craves. It was finely-crafted bubble-wrap, I admit that.

    Raising Arizona is a not-so-funny comedy surrounding the marriage and infertility of ex-cop, Ed McDonnough (Holly Hunter) and her ex-con husband, H.I. (Nicolas Cage). When the couple is told by her doctor that they would not be able to conceive a child of their own, Ed is devastated. While watching television one evening, the couple sees that Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), a rich, furniture store owner and his wife were now the proud parents of quintuplets. Ed concocts a plan to "borrow" one of their babies because she believes they "have their hands full" with 5 babies. This in turn sets off a crazy string of events which leave the couple in a fight for their "borrowed" child, their freedom and their love for one another. The theme of Raising Arizona is a character's struggle within themselves to soothe the constant "wants" in life that are not necessarily needed. Throughout the movie, Ed just wants to be happy. Before marrying H.I., she just wanted to meet the right man and get married. During one scene when Ed is booking H.I. into one of his many jail stints, she is sobbing because her then fianc&eacute;' had broken up with her. This was the first time that Ed realized that she had feelings for H.I., when he showed compassion for her and told her that her fianc&eacute;' had to be stupid to leave her. Soon after, Ed and H.I. were married and she immediately wanted to start having babies. This proved to be impossible for them and her desperate "want" to be a mother caused her to grow depressed, lose interest in everything - including cleaning her house and she lost her job. H.I. just seems to be along for the crazy ride. The wild story line and almost unfathomable shenanigans in this movie are somewhat similar to the 1990 Dennis Dugan movie, Problem Child, starring John Ritter. In both movies, there are couples who desperately want to have a child and when they are both given what they want it proves to be much more than they can handle. Both movies are filled with conflict and chaos right up to the very end. The motifs and camera angles brought out the theme of this movie and made it more exciting to watch. Throughout the movie the viewer is constantly reminded that Ed wants a baby and after Baby Arizona is "borrowed", the camera is fixated on how Ed and H.I. plan to keep him and keep their secret. The camera techniques were great in this movie. There were several parallel cuts that took the viewer back and forth between two different locations as the suspense was rising. In one particular scene, Ed, H.I. and Baby Jr. are driving home from spending a day with friends and they pull into a store to pick up some diapers. H.I. is tempted to resort to his old ways and ends up robbing the store. Ed sees him through the window and immediately becomes angry and drives away, leaving him to fend for himself. What H.I. doesn't anticipate though, is the store clerk is ready for him. After pushing an emergency button to alert the authorities, the clerk pulls out a rifle and starts shooting at H.I. Just as he is running away the cops pull up and start a wild chase. The cameras cut back and forth between H.I. running through streets, yards and houses, the cops chasing him and Ed, who had a change of heart about leaving him and decides to go back and try to help save him from the police. All of the chaos and goofy humor combined with a crazy plot take the viewer right back to the theme of the movie, choose your "wants" lightly because they just might turn out to be your "want nots".

    You've gotta hand it to the Coen brothers, they sure know how to inject style and flamboyance in their creations. And to think that "Raising Arizona" was only their second feature film makes the accomplishment even more impressive although "Blood Simple." was powerful enough an announcement of two upcoming talents threatening to shake Hollywood's conventions with a unique sense of eccentricity, and human depth. "Blood Simple." was still borrowing some elements from film-noir and Hitchcock movies, and, no matter how effective it was, it could have easily been targeted as an exercise in style. This is why the Coen brothers couldn't have made a better choice by making a zany comedy with a tender and more optimistic tone. And not only the film works but "Raising Arizona" is now a comedy classic, so special that it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath than 80's comedies for the simple reason that it differs from what was made in that decade. And that's the thing about the Coen brothers, they make timeless films, set in universes, playing like crossroads between fantasy and reality, where their stories float with a bizarre but so penetrating poetry. I know this is a Coen brothers' so we're tempted to get deeper on the subject. Granted it's not just a story about two people who kidnap a baby because they can't have one, there are far more symbolism and philosophical material lying underneath the screwball carapace, but how about enjoying the film for what it is: one hilarious piece of cinematic greatness carried by the kind of colorful cast that made the Coen's films so lively. And what a cast! Nicolas Cage is H.I. aka "Hi" McDunnough, a multiple recidivist specialized in robbing market stores and Holly Hunter is Edwina aka 'Ed', the photographer who took so many mug shots she ended up proving that indeed, opposites attracted. But the Coen brothers are not the type of directors to comfortably sit on the presence of two solid protagonist, they know supporting characters are the spices that give the film its flavor. So, we have the two escaped prison buddies, two brothers played by two Johns, John Goodman, who'd become one of the Coen's greatest asset with such a physical presence he'd steal the show anytime, anywhere and Forsythe as his dim-witted brother. There is Sam McMumurray as Glen, the bourgeois pain-in-the-ass and the late Trey Wilson as Nathan Arizona, father of cute blonde-haired quints, the furniture magnate whose motto consist on concluding all his statements with "or my name isn't Nathan Arizona". Each character illuminates the screen with a unique presence, even little Nathan Jr. makes you believe people would kill each other to get him, and Frances McDormand is given a less important play but plays it with the required over-the-top way you'd expect from the woman who chose a guy like Glen for husband. Speaking of Glen, nothing against Sam McMurray but I would have loved to see John Turturro playing his part, if only because it would have made "Raising Arizona"'s the consummate Coen brothers' film, with characters before stories. Hell, it goes even to the point where the most seemingly inoffensive market-cashier can tot a gunshot and become a Dirty Harry-like figure, no one is to be underestimated, not when laughs are at stakes. Naturally, such story deserves a worthy villain and this is where Randal 'Tex' Cobb makes his entrances, as a man coming from nowhere, supposedly incarnating the devil, whenever he goes, grass never grow back and this modern Atilla of biker of the apocalypse first emerges in HI's dream after he stole Nathan's kid. He symbolizes HI's conscience, something that will torment him until he finds the way to redeem himself, and this is the philosophical stuff hidden beneath the film, it's about characters doing morally wrong things, and finding their own path to redemption. When a recidivist teams up with a cop and both stole parents' fruits of love, you know this ain't the way to reach marital happiness. And the whole narrative is cooked up up in typical Mid-West accent, flirting with caricature but giving "Raising Arizona"its colorful spirit, the same as "Fargo" with its overuse of Scandinavian accent made of "Yah" and "You betcha". This is the Coens' signature and it doesn't limit to dialogs but goes to the soundtrack and from the title to the score, you have the hillbilly thing screaming all over the place. Till today, it's impossible not to hear "Raising Arizona" without having that fast-paced upbeat banjo music and catchy yodel that makes you want to escape from whatever makes your routine. You got it, "Raising Arizona" is pure entertaining escapism, with a man and a woman giving their life a meaning the wrong way, before learning the lessons, the hard way. And what a lesson! the conclusion of the film is probably the most insightful and beautiful thing ever put in a film, transcending the limits of comedies to something that cuts straight to your heart. And by the way, I couldn't believe Roger Ebert's review, my only guess he didn't have enough perspective and he probably changed his mind after. But thanks to Ebert, I learned the definition of a good movie, from Howard Hawks' quote. It's made of three good scenes and no bad scenes. There are none in "Raising Arizona" and there are three mesmerizing sequences: one of the most promising and funny introductions ever, then the market scene that reinvents the foot-chase forever, and made it deeply intertwined with hillbilly yodel like banjo music did for "Bonnie and Clyde", and ten you have one of the most poignant and meaningful monologues ever. There are three great moments in "Raising Arizona", in the beginning, the middle and the ending, and if only for these moments, with so many laughs in-between, "Raising Arizona" is one of the greatest comedies ever  or my IMDb user name isn't ElMaruecan82.

    The Coen Brothers have made many great films and worked in many different genres. One of their most famous comedies is Raising Arizona, a fast paced, zany comedy that can only come from the minds of the Coens. H.I. "Hi" McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) is a career criminal who falls for policewoman Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter) and goes straight for her. After they get married they attempt to have a child, but when Ed finds out she is infertile and the pair unable to adopt the couple take the logically route of kidnapping a baby from a wealthy couple who have just had quintuplets. But their actions get complicated by two escaped convicted, a police investigation and a ruthless bounty hunter. Raising Arizona is a very funny comedy that zips along at a great pace. The Coens' fingerprints are all over this film, having a sharply written script and excellent direction throughout. The jokes are constant throughout the film, giving us a variety of style of humour, from great one-liners, character interactions and pure physical comedy. The Coens bring a lot of energy to the film as we get over the top set pieces like the robbery where Ed abandons Hi and the Coens being a brings a kinetic style with their camera movements and editing of set pieces. We get a great prologue at the beginning of the film as we find out about Hi and Ed's past and how they came to their solution with funny jokes on the way. As well as the direction, Raising Arizona is blessed with a top cast who give both comic and sincere performances. Cage and Hunter had great chemistry together, having excellent comic time and were committed to their roles. Cage worked well with his supporting cast as they assemble a top cast: John Goodman being a particular highlight as one of the escaped prisoners. The Coens Brothers' direction is frantic through the film, using fast paced editing, hand-held cameras and tracking shots, amplifying the comedy, showing this maniac universe and gives Raising Arizona a distinctive visual style. The Coen's regular composer Carter Burwell also supplies a great score for the film, particular the use of a country/folk like guitar score which was a perfect fit for the film. Raising Arizona is a very entertaining, funny and heartfelt comedy that can stand along some of the best works the Coen Brothers have had to offer. It is a screwball comedy that can cater to many tests from intelligent jokes, observations and character interactions, to more over the top physical and visual comedy.

    Honestly, I did not expect even the first Cohen brothers films to be really good. This one definitely is worth watching because the seriousness with which Cohen brothers make frivolous movies is best and this time. Busy throughout the film to make the foreground absurd or to the characters or to the situations in which they fall in, the two filmmakers get us into the world of attracting of opposites. Line from the movie, which can serve as an example here would be: "If a frog had wings, it would hardly hitting the legs into the body when jumping." In equally absurd way arises the love between a young policewoman and obsessive in robberies of shops criminal (collection of fools, as they point themselves). As she turns frigid, they decide to steal a child from a newly born five twins. And thus began the mess that does not stop until the end. The film is ideal for detente and kicking a bad mood and driving a good one.

    Raising Arizona is easily one of the funniest,greatest and most original Comedies of all time and a timeless film classic. Filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a wonderful screenplay,truly beautiful cinematography and an unforgettable score,Raising Arizona is The Coen Brothers at their best and greatest. Raising Arizona tells the story of H.I. McDunnough(Nicholas Cage),a criminal and repeat offender and police officer 'Ed' Edwina(Holly Hunter)who fall in love and after falling in love decide to get married and have kids. When H.I. and Ed can't conceive kids of their own,H.I and Ed kidnap a quintuplet,Nathan Arizona JR(T.J Kuhn JR) one of the children of local business man Nathan Arizona(Trey Wilson). When H.I and Ed take Nathan J.r and want to raise him as their own wild and hilarious things happen in their lives. Raising Arizona is one of the all-time great classic Comedies from The Coen Brothers that came after their amazing film debut Blood Simple. When filmmakers have a first film that is so acclaimed and well loved, most filmmakers have to do a second film that lives up to the quality of their first film and not only does Raising Arizona live up to Blood Simple but also gives viewers and brilliant and much lighter cinematic experience. One of the reasons Raising Arizona is excellent and truly hilarious is because The Coen Brothers have given us a flawless film that combines great laughs with style and substance where everything in the film is over the top and exaggerated to the point of going over the top beyond belief. The laughs and humor in the film are funny,ingenious and original with hilarious Slapstick Comedy,funny dialog and moments in the movie that have you laughing until your stomach hurts and will have tears running down your face. The laughs are so crazy and over the top you will you're watching a surreal live Action Cartoon. What is also great about the Humor in this film and other Coen Brother films is that the laughs are subtle and used in visuals and imagery that are not obvious the first time you watch RA but when you watch the film with multiple viewings you will notice or catch some of the visual jokes of the film. And speaking of of visuals RA is one of the most beautiful and visually stunning Comedies I have ever seen. Barry Sonnefield's photography is amazing and powerful with wide angle shots,close ups and shots of the sunlight,road and dusty world of Arizona. Sonnefield's photography gives the film a surreal and wild energy that you don't see in most comedies and that is one of the great things that set RZ apart from other films of it's type because RA can have wonderful style but also a great substance. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is hilarious and well and one of the best screenplays in Comedy history with the Coens giving the main great dialog that is funny,memorable and stylized as well as greatly using narration for H.I. McDunnough and lines from the main characters that are quotable and will stay in your mind. The two main characters H.I. and Ed McDunnough while over the top and are cartoon characters who are funny but are given great depth and humanity and you feel like the two truly love and care for one another and even though H.I and Ed kidnapped a baby they don't do for fame or money,they do it because they want to be parents and want to love a child and the kidnapping make the main characters more complex than they truly are and that is one of things that great about RA and the Coens. Although not an Action film RA has a couple of good Action and chase scenes that are thrilling and exciting. Especially the film's main chase scene which is one of the funniest,wildest,original and over the top chase scenes in film history and it is a classic chase that that you will never forget. The ending of the film is funny,beautiful and very optimistic and will make you wonder what will happen to H.I and ED. An great ending to a great film. The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Nicholas Cage is brilliant,funny and at his best as H.I McDunnough,with Cage bringing laughs and depth to the role. Holly Hunter is excellent as 'Ed' Edwina McDunnough,with Hunter feisty and funny and having great chemistry with Cage. Trey Wilson is wonderful and fun as Nathan Arizona,a local business man. John Goodman and William Forsythe are great,funny and over the top as Gale and Evelle Snoats,escaped convicts who are H.I's friends. Sam McMurray and Francis McDormand are amazing and hilarious as husband and wife Glen and Dot,friends of H.I. and Ed. Randell 'Tex' Cobb is fantastic as Leonard Smalls,a man hunter who's a man of few words and is looking for Nathan JR. The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is excellent,with The Coens always moving the camera,using wide angles,low angles,close-ups and giving the film a great visual style. Great direction by The Coens. The score by Carter Burwell is is amazing,funny,beautiful and very quirky and matches the tone of the film,with Burwell greatly mixing whistles,yodeling,organs and banjos. Wonderful score by Burwell. In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you check out Raising Arizona,a truly hilarious,funny and unforgettable Comedy and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I adore this one. I'll have you know it is my 'feelgood' movie, having seen it now a dozen times it never fails to lift my spirits. After some deliberation, I am finally putting it on my list of must see films. What the Coens have done here is a very delicate thing. The obvious first. What you see in the film is both 'real', a loving trailer trash couple cannot conceive a child, and sleepless bending of reality as the urge to steal one so they can finally have a 'full family unit' manifests around them in all sorts of crazy situations. The biker from Hell is the tip of the thread, first dreamed about and in a weird confluence of forces soon appears in reality as dreamed. From that point on, everything is askew while pointing to anxious dreaming. Prison pals from HI's criminal past show up in the middle of the night. The frantic hunt for Huggies, starting with another botched holdup. HI's boss as the dreary dead-end of family life. More obvious, the business with the hole in the ground. It isn't simply surreal, a term normally associated with vaguely weird stream-of-consciousness. It's film noir, the film is sandwiched after all between the much more openly noirish Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. The Coens get noir, where the desire for life to be other/better than it is (not for sex or money as in noir, but blissful family life here personified in the baby) causes peculiar whims in perception, and those whims mysteriously manifest in the narrator's 'choosing' of the reality he remembers, collapsing in the process. Noir is magical, alluring to this day, because all those things are causally inextricable, desire from dream or memory from mysterious happenings in the story, which is why we often collapse the whole knotted mess to the workings of some celestial fate. There's all sorts of stuff woven on top. Reagan's morning in America as neurotic hyper-normalcy, the bum HI as the flipside of that, laid-back and tied to the American tradition of glorified frontiersmen and criminals, lampooned in the biker. 1980's suburbia as consumerist limbo. It's a helluva ride. Next to Blue Velvet and Society, the definitive 1980's film. It does all sort of collapse together by the end, which supports and enhances the idea of the random , whimsical arising of dreams. Big Lebowski starts here. Its charm? You can 'get' this without 'getting' it. The whole Huggies sequence is as profound to me as any cinematic dream. But it isn't like Tarkovksy who bypasses the mind by long mystifying sweeps, hitting deep in this way. It strikes an amazing balance between self-conscious intelligent conception and the bypass in spontaneous asides of fun and tremendous heartHI and Ed (the lovely Holly Hunter) are one of the most loving couples in filmdom. Intelligence, fun and emotion, these three are inextricable. This being so, you can 'get' the film via any route. It ends with an Ozzie and Harriet movie dream of the perfect life.

    Criminal Herbert I. "Hi" (Nicolas Cage) after his continued visits to a prison happens to marry Edwina "Ed" after his latest release from prison. Soon the couple discovers that Ed is not fit to be a mother and are unable to adopt a baby due to Ed's Criminal record. So they decide to kidnap one of the Quints of a local furniture magnate "Nathan Arizona" believing it to be Nathan Jr. Problems arouse as Hi is visited by his prison buddies and he thinks of returning to his notorious lifestyle along with his supervisor discovering that kid is not his after he made an unsuccessful wife swapping offer to him. Matters get worse as a bounty hunter named Leo Smalls gets in search of Nathan Jr. to sell him in the market and Hi's buddies taking undue advantage of junior's identity. Do watch this early Coen Bros. movie because of some great comic scenes especially the scene where Hi steals a pack of diapers and it is one of those movies that gives us the insight into the kind of characters the duo generates, dialogues they write and unconventional music score that became symbolic for their future movies. MY RATING: 9/10

    The film Raising Arizona begins with the unfortunate life of H.I. McDunnough (Nicholas Cage) and his journeys in and out of prison where he meets his future wife, Edwina "Ed" (Holly Hunter), a corrections officer. The two get married and discover that they cannot have children of their own, despite their beliefs that they are good people and would make great parents. Around that time, Nathan and Florence Arizona (Trey Wilson and Lynne Kitei) give birth to quintuplets, and discover that so many children are "more than they can handle!" The McDunnoughs, with their good intentions in hand, kidnap one of the quintuplets to raise as their own, believing that they are doing the Arizona's a favor. The primary theme of this film is the effects of karma, or the idea that "what goes around comes around." This theme can be found throughout the film, as characters like Gale and Evelle Snoats (John Goodman and William Forsythe) fail in their attempt to rob a bank and eventually return to jail. The theme can also be found through the consequences that the McDunnoughs face as a result of the kidnapping, and the reactions of Nathan Arizona when he finally learns what has happened to his son. The primary tool used to explain the theme of the film is the voice-over. A voice-over can be used to fill in gaps and make a film cohesive, or to explain background or contextual information to the viewer (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). In Raising Arizona, the voice-over is used for both reasons, and gives thorough insights into the thoughts and motives of the characters. This tool is very effective in conveying the theme of the film in that sense. The acting throughout the film is also very effective in helping to convey the theme of the film. H.I. is a very innocent character, despite his many crimes, and the acting portrays this well. Ed is another na&iuml;ve character, who does not fully understand the consequences of her actions. As both of these characters begin to realize the consequences of their actions, they begin to take responsibility for them and try to do what is best for everyone. In that sense, both actors help to contribute to the theme of the film by effectively displaying the emotions and motivations of their characters. The theme of this film is similar to the themes of many other films, like, for example, the film Elf, where the primary character, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell), acts on his good intentions, even when his actions may not be the right thing to do. For example, in one scene, Buddy gets in a fight with a store "Santa" (Artie Lange) because Buddy knows that the man is an imposter. The message of this film is very important to everyone, because good intentions are very important, but it is still important that one always tries to do what is right. Though they may have started off on the wrong path, Ed and H.I. finally make amends and do what is right for everyone involved in the situation. References Boggs, J. M. & Petrie, D. W. (2008).

    Raising Arizona is a film that follows the story of an unconventional couple; convict Hi (Cage) and police officer Ed (Hunter), as they attempt to find harmony and happiness in their lives together. However, their greatest obstacle is Ed's sterility that slowly wears on their relationship and threatens their sanity until opportunity arises in the form of a wealthy local whose wife births "more than she can handle". Accomplishing the abduction proves a bit difficult, but the rabid persistence of Ed drives their mission to success, and with the addition of this vital piece, it seems a true family is born. Unfortunately, prying and obnoxious colleagues, mischievous jailbirds/buddies, and a gritty detective with a Harley threaten their happiness, but also demonstrate how misguided and selfish their actions have been. Returning the baby to an appreciative and surprisingly sympathetic father, Hi reflects on the affection we have for children, even if they're not our own and is able to sleep peacefully with dreams for the future that he hopes holds a family of his very own. I generally appreciate the Coen Brother's films and what I appreciate most is their ability to hold interest of the audience through plot twists and strong characters; there's nothing extreme or very showy about their work and yet it stands out because there is only ever and illusion of normalcy and sanity in their characters or the plot, really the work is quite complex but we appreciate it more because they make no pretense. Raising Arizona continues this tradition and also has quite a flavor of Americana, enhanced greatly by the colorful characters. The humor was ludicrous most times, but it was balanced through the sensitive and reflective nature of the protagonist, whose broodings lend itself to the underlying sense of loneliness and hopelessness of the characters and the landscape and drive the rich plot forward. I feel that any criticism would simply be void for two reasons: I believe that this film is very stylistic and I don't believe that they ventured out of this particular structure, any risk they took (including the dream sequences) had basis in reality and only served to give the film more poetic flavor, and secondly, I believe that the film was unique and heartfelt among it's genre, which at times is difficult to achieve in something externally so seemingly detached as comedy, and mainly, I think there was valid reasoning behind it's creation, which is my only objection with modern film. The cinematography of the film was very interesting and was able to keep the audience occupied by the sheer amount of stimulation the wild camera movements brought. I was able to appreciate the shaky camera work simply because I think it does justice to Hi's convict past as well as his current lifestyle, punctuated by his most daring criminal offense yet. This apparently dramatic and brutal world is something that few of us can sympathize with and I think the long takes through several different environments contributes to that foreign aspect of the film that quite frankly makes it hilarious. Motifs in the film include the joined hands of Hi and Ed, representing their bond and their support of each other, the fire that erupts from the detective, representing his nature, and the convenient store that represents Hi's temptation or the pull of his old life. The brothers use this as well as a few non-diegetic inserts (including baby toys) to bring a bit of understanding to the rapidly moving plot, but it is interesting to note that this veers a bit from the slapstick genre that is quite shallow and brings a poetic aspect to the film. In the abduction scene the use of high-angle and low-angle shots capture flawlessly both the perspective of Hi and of the babies and the power shift that takes place between them, succeeding in making Hi seem vulnerable among these small creatures. Also, throughout the entire film the use of the wide-angle lens is used, making people and surroundings seem distorted and often a bit out of proportion. The abduction scene demonstrates the use of this very well, especially when the babies are taking a very long time to reach the door and then the end of the hallway, giving Hi enough time to catch them before Mrs. Arizona discovers. This also contributes to the suspense of the scene, because everything seems to take longer to happen and Hi is running out of time to act. Off-screen action and voice is used quite a bit to stage a change in events in the plot and repetition of certain events forming a montage is comedic as well as clarity inducing. It really strikes both emotional stances quite well and makes for a heartfelt and poetic take on the slapstick comedy genre, aided by the strong narrative voice that guides us through a ridiculous and tragic journey of an unlikely couple trying to find the missing piece in their family.

    A quick checklist for anyone considering this movie: 1. Coenheads - if you are one, proceed to checkout 2. Hollow humorist - if you like to be force fed your humor, you're in luck. 3. Bicoastalism - plenty of middle/Southern/Western stereotypes here 4. Amateur Auteurs - Watch this film so you can earn your "I'm-more- sophisticated-than-you" pin. All others should bypass this cinematic desert. It has been said that much art is devised to impress other artists. I think that attitude is central to Coeney Island, and this film certainly falls into the category euphemistically called "quirky". Products such as this can't be blamed for aiming squarely at their intended audience. If you like this kind of pseudo-intellectual fare, bully for you. There are plenty of vendors for this kind of ware. All others who will try to find anything substantial will be sorely disappointed. You won't experience wildness, depth, sentiment, wonder, fury, intrigue, edginess, insight, lasciviousness, or even a good joke. In fact, what's really missing is honesty. You will be served up mounds of pretense and self-important contrivance, infused with long-expired sophomorism, and powdered with clip art humanism. Package above with ,uh, quirky dialogue (hard to assign that term since the characters don't express anything to each other or the audience) and you have all the haughty form-over-substance. cookie-cutter originality that the anesthetized soul craves. It was finely-crafted bubble-wrap, I admit that.

    Raising Arizona is a not-so-funny comedy surrounding the marriage and infertility of ex-cop, Ed McDonnough (Holly Hunter) and her ex-con husband, H.I. (Nicolas Cage). When the couple is told by her doctor that they would not be able to conceive a child of their own, Ed is devastated. While watching television one evening, the couple sees that Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), a rich, furniture store owner and his wife were now the proud parents of quintuplets. Ed concocts a plan to "borrow" one of their babies because she believes they "have their hands full" with 5 babies. This in turn sets off a crazy string of events which leave the couple in a fight for their "borrowed" child, their freedom and their love for one another. The theme of Raising Arizona is a character's struggle within themselves to soothe the constant "wants" in life that are not necessarily needed. Throughout the movie, Ed just wants to be happy. Before marrying H.I., she just wanted to meet the right man and get married. During one scene when Ed is booking H.I. into one of his many jail stints, she is sobbing because her then fianc&eacute;' had broken up with her. This was the first time that Ed realized that she had feelings for H.I., when he showed compassion for her and told her that her fianc&eacute;' had to be stupid to leave her. Soon after, Ed and H.I. were married and she immediately wanted to start having babies. This proved to be impossible for them and her desperate "want" to be a mother caused her to grow depressed, lose interest in everything - including cleaning her house and she lost her job. H.I. just seems to be along for the crazy ride. The wild story line and almost unfathomable shenanigans in this movie are somewhat similar to the 1990 Dennis Dugan movie, Problem Child, starring John Ritter. In both movies, there are couples who desperately want to have a child and when they are both given what they want it proves to be much more than they can handle. Both movies are filled with conflict and chaos right up to the very end. The motifs and camera angles brought out the theme of this movie and made it more exciting to watch. Throughout the movie the viewer is constantly reminded that Ed wants a baby and after Baby Arizona is "borrowed", the camera is fixated on how Ed and H.I. plan to keep him and keep their secret. The camera techniques were great in this movie. There were several parallel cuts that took the viewer back and forth between two different locations as the suspense was rising. In one particular scene, Ed, H.I. and Baby Jr. are driving home from spending a day with friends and they pull into a store to pick up some diapers. H.I. is tempted to resort to his old ways and ends up robbing the store. Ed sees him through the window and immediately becomes angry and drives away, leaving him to fend for himself. What H.I. doesn't anticipate though, is the store clerk is ready for him. After pushing an emergency button to alert the authorities, the clerk pulls out a rifle and starts shooting at H.I. Just as he is running away the cops pull up and start a wild chase. The cameras cut back and forth between H.I. running through streets, yards and houses, the cops chasing him and Ed, who had a change of heart about leaving him and decides to go back and try to help save him from the police. All of the chaos and goofy humor combined with a crazy plot take the viewer right back to the theme of the movie, choose your "wants" lightly because they just might turn out to be your "want nots".
