  A troubled rock star descends into madness in the midst of his physical and social isolation from everyone.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The movie tells the story of rock singer "Pink" who is sitting in his hotel room in Los Angeles, burnt out from the music business and only able to perform on stage with the help of drugs. Based on the 1979 double album "The Wall" by Pink Floyd, the film begins in Pink's youth where he is crushed by the love of his mother. Several years later he is punished by the teachers in school because he is starting to write poems. Slowly he begins to build a wall around himself to be protected from the world outside. The film shows all this in massive and epic pictures until the very end where he tears down the wall and breaks free.

    Pink Floyd began to reach its heyday when rock-and-roll music was still viewed as "the devil's music" and was negatively received in circles outside of its core fanbase. Let it be known and heard that the band's cult film Pink Floyd: The Wall has more knowledgeable and thought-provoking things to say than anything any of those circles ever said. The film is a deafening, absolutely incomparable movie-experience and an aesthetic and narrative breakthrough for music-documentaries. The film doesn't assume the basic qualities of conventional rock-documentaries, not becoming a concert-film or profiling a band and getting down to what makes them unique and noteworthy. It destroys conventionality within the genre, assuming the qualities of startling and powerful impressionistic and expressionistic cinema simultaneously. The Wall assumes a loose narrative, following Pink (Bob Geldof), the increasingly detached narrator of the film who has wicked, often explicit hallucinations. His hallucinations feature violent depictions of war, disturbing videos of children singing harmoniously to music, and many others that I do not want to spoil. The film is only disjointed if that's how you choose to view it, meaning if you seek to find meaning and piece together its small vignettes into something larger and more universal, you'll have an effective picture in terms or thematic relevance. If you watch the film solely for the images, sound, music, and content, then you get the expressionism I spoke of earlier. Ultimately, the film's central theme - at least in my eyes - is self-destruction, from a domestic and global perspective in addition to a more personal one. Its constant images of violence, torment, and the dehumanization of children can effectively state that the film's central ideas deal with that of destruction from the inside rather than outside forces. Combined with these live-action and animated clips (brilliantly directed by Gerald Scarfe) are the songs of Floyd's enigmatic masterwork of an album The Wall, which was released in 1979. Rarely has rock music achieved heights these high. Rarely have themes such as isolation, desperation, and self-destruction been so prominent and affecting on the viewer. At ninety-five minutes long, Pink Floyd: The Wall has the impact of an epic, and works on levels from an excellent portrait of a rock album to a compelling and elusive tone-poem on the state of the America and the common man. Starring: Bob Geldof. Directed by Alan Parker and Gerald Scarfe (animated scenes only).

    I've been a fan of Pink Floyd since the seventies and in particular love The Wall album, which was based on Roger Waters feelings of boredom and alienation during massive American tours in the late seventies and has flashbacks to his brutal treatment at school in the fifties. The film, a musical with little dialogue and mostly made up of Pink Floyd tunes, sees Bob Geldof play Pink, a burned out rock star who is going insane in his hotel room. Also there are flashbacks to the fifties of how Pink, well Waters really, became a rock star by writing lyrics to what would become Pink Floyd songs during school lessons to the dismay of his teachers, who are shown up as sadistic buffoons. Later in the film Pink, high on drugs, descends into madness and smashes up his hotel room and attacks a groupie. When he is sedated and drifts into a deep sleep, Bob Hoskins has a decent cameo as his manager, Pink dreams he has become a fascist leader at a mass rally similar to a huge concert, but with the difference that the music is inciting hatred and violence. ( While you might wonder what this has to do with a left leaning figure like Waters, he was highly critical of the extreme Right and nationalism on The Wall). Finally the film ends with Pink being trapped behind a huge wall. OK non fans will hate it, as you have to have a deep understanding of Roger Waters mindset in 1979 and what inspired the film and album, but for all fans of Waters and Pink Floyd, The Wall is a must see film.

    I recently really discovered Pink Floyd's music (yeah, I know) and The Wall is one of my favorite albums from them, and when I heard it was a film I did think it would be something like what I got. It's rich in symbolism and there's a lot here that surely went over my head, but for the most part even when you're totally lost at what it's trying to tell you there's a lot to enjoy. The music taken at face-value is amazing as it is, so in that way it works, but some segments are more noticeably stronger than others. The final ten minutes are haunting and never really let you gasp for air, and in that intoxicating sense it's able to fully fledge in your memory.

    Roger Waters didn't like it. The director Alan Parker didn't like it. Animation designer Gerald Scarfe didn't like it. David Gilmour didn't like it as much as the album and the concert. So is Pink Floyd The Wall bad? No. Is it good then? Sort of. It certainly isn't great. This live-action/animated musical follows Pink, a rock star, who isolates himself from the world and slowly goes mad. The first thing you notice about the movie is that its strange narrative structure was clearly influenced by the whole surrealist movement. While this fits some parts of the whole The Wall concept perfectly, some parts are also rather messy  especially in the first act. In spite of it being fairly messy (direction wise) Pink Floyd The Wall isn't hard to follow, particularly if you're familiar with the album. It doesn't take a genius to understand the movie. Let's just take the musical aspect of the movie out of the way. The music is undoubtedly good, after all it is one of the most famous Pink Floyd albums. But if you're interested in the music, one might ask why not just listen to the album instead of watching the movie. One may also argue that the The Wall concept is pretty detailed on the album and that this story doesn't need to be told through another medium. That being said, I didn't like some songs in the movie. And by some songs I primarily mean the usage of When the Tigers Broke Free. During the segments that use this song, I couldn't shake the feeling that this song was written simply to tie the movie together. I know that it was written at the same time as The Wall, but I couldn't help to feel otherwise  the song was narrating what was happening in the movie. I found that to be sloppy and unnecessary. I don't need narrative exposition for something I can see with my own eyes. Also, the main actor Bob Geldof, who is the lead singer of The Boomtown Rats, couldn't do a satisfying Waters impression throughout his singing parts. So that's another reason to just listen to the album instead. Considering the whole movie is pretty much a 90 minute music video for the album and that everyone who listens to Pink Floyd (the movie's primary audience) is acquainted with The Wall concept, I won't spend much time analyzing the story. I'll just say I fully agree with Waters when he said that the movie doesn't let the audience sympathize with Pink. It's also very strange that the movie has so many anti war elements when the album hasn't. The Final Cut, the album which came out a year after this movie, has much more anti war propaganda than The Wall. Anyway, as I said, much of the story is being told through Pink Floyd songs. Since the movie isn't so story driven, I should mention the visuals. The animation is perfect, it's full of beautifully twisted pictures that often resemble an LSD trip. The cinematography is also stunning, mostly during the Another Brick in The Wall Pt 2 segment. Basically, the movie is worth watching based on visuals alone. And if you're a big Pink Floyd fan you'll enjoy this strange experience that is Pink Floyd The Wall even more. Rating: 7/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com

    I recall seeing The Wall at the midnight movies a few times, and I found it quite depressing. Let's face it, the movie, The Wall is a sad and depressing movie about Pink. He is basically depressed to the point of being catatonic, and he spends most of the movie just sitting with a cigarette in his hand. The rest of it is mostly in his mind. So what do I think this movie is worth a 10? If you just look at The Wall as a bunch of music videos, it is pretty good. Bob Geldof, who plays Pink, was not any great actor. He was the singer for the Boomtown Rats, and he is probably in this movie because he looks like a depressed and unhappy fellow. So we cannot really judge The Wall on the acting. It is about songs and short bits. The teacher yelling at the young Pink is a great little video that goes with the song Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2. In The Flesh has a great bit of video. So, if you really want to enjoy this movie, I suggest that you just enjoy the music, and look at it as a big music video.

    We have the rock star Pink, who spends much of the movie sitting in his apartment, unresponsively watching a television set. We see flashbacks or fantasies, of bomber-filled skies during World War Two, memories of his childhood with his overprotective mother and of the school he went to as a child, adult memories of his tuning out his wife, who leaves him for another man, a sudden "turn" where he acts violently and smashing everything in his apartment, animations involving fascism and a wall, himself as a fascist leader. He only comes to life when a bunch of people have to give him a drug injection so he can perform a concert show. The movie is based on Pink Floyd's super-hit album "The Wall", though one song is referenced that wasn't in the album. But what does the movie represent? Pink has as much character as a department store mannequin, and we don't really find out anything about him, or why he is such a passive character. Burned out on drugs, or fame? Really, the movie is a whole bunch of images (often repeated), and the whole isn't greater than the sum of its parts.

    A right-brained pity parade with pop hooks. Most people aren't going to have the patience to make sense of it; you can't really blame them, it's easier to let the images wash over you (which are pretty unpleasant). Trying to really get into this is like the scene with Pink rearranging hotel room debris in schizo patterns...would you really *want* to understand? There's definitely a method to the madness, though. Its not as incoherent as it seems. The album is like listening to a musical suicide note & the movie is like being inside a suicide's brain, every run on thought & recollection recreated in kaleidscopic detail. Along with Gerald Scarfe's delirious cartoons it's an epic montage of misery; words can't really describe it. In the end you can forgive it's miserablism, its earned & most others on the same wavelength don't have the same sheer visual inventiveness, anyway. It's possibly the greatest music video ever made. Mental disintegration is the perfect topic for this medium. THE WALL is about a depressed rock star, reviewing his life through a drugged out haze in every ugly detail.The kind of life summary someone hitting rock bottom makes. Everything is pain & darkness, fresh trauma waiting around every corner. It's the visual equivalent of Edvard Munch's Scream painting (which the movie poster riffs on). One long wail of despair, it's only interested in the hellish depths, the kind of flick you don't put on often. Negating everything is the first step to accepting everything, however. Here, the journey through Pink's subconscious is set to song. It's Roger Water's MTV therapy session & would be a total waste of time if he wasn't so masochistically honest about what a f*cked up human being he/we are. It's so harsh that it denies the truth of anything except pain, sweeping up much in its wake- mothers/lovers school fascism war - the whole convoluted system that sends people into these suicidal spirals by trying to mold them from day 1. They're not separable. It's in that spirit of total negation that someone can really bare to look closely at these things...paint it black. What stands out in this operatic fever dream? Sarcastic schoolyard anthems, masked children on conveyor belts ground to paste, cruel teachers, self mutilating rock stars laying waste to mankind, screwing flowers, towering walls, trials & talking asses, explosions, worms, dead staring eyes- Its amazing how everything gets a call-out, a big summing up. It's all here. Fatherless boys & castrating mothers, goose stepping & falling bombs...this stuff is great. Roger Waters is a d*ick but Roger Waters also has balls to be retracing his steps through the labyrinth like he does here, It's not either/or. Exposing your inner dictator isn't a walk in the park. I'm really glad for movies like this, not only does it recreate what a nervous breakdown can feel like but goes further & holistically ties it back into society with the totalitarian stuff. Pink is a microcosm. The wall itself makes me think of Wilhelm Reich's body armor idea, the muscular shielding people build to live in emotional war zones which quickly deadens them to *any* feeling. That in turn leads to things like shooting heroin, screwing groupies & committing mass murder to feel alive again (its utterly perfect how after the wall crashes only children are left, scrounging through wreckage). Critics who complained the film lacked resolution are dead wrong. It's great that someone made the connection for rock audiences between pop stardom & fascist demagoguery, too. It's done in a way where you're not sure whether to chuckle or quake. The hammer & sickle pageant that erupts into rioting while an exhilarating melody plays has to be the most jaw dropping moment I've seen in a musical. You feel guilty for getting into the tune with beatings & rapes on-screen, the racial slurs & skinned heads. Its blood curdling & absurd. Way to turn a cherished form inside out & shovel its steaming guts in the faces of the fans you hate, Roger. That's entertainment! There's worse sins than trying to shovel everything & the kitchen sink in but the album/movie wants to articulate the agony of it all so completely that it gets numbing quick, a constant bludgeon of horror & despair, the ultimate bad trip flick. It can be overwhelming if you're not prepared. The music provides the characters, the story, everything else is really just a framework for an apocalyptic day dream. I love Pink Floyd. Along with Radiohead they made the scariest rock music I've heard. I never connected much with pop until I heard these guys. THE WALL is the last album where the group was firing even close to all cylinders, half brilliant & half awful. I don't need these kind of pitch black tunes as much now but it was sure comforting when I did. Standout image: hard to choose just one but probably the flower devouring her mate. Best song: again hard but likely 'Comfortably Numb', which oughta be the rock anthem of the whole 20th century

    The album by Pink Floyd known as "The Wall" is a concept album which tells a story from beginning to end. While listening to only a few songs, it's hard to tell. But back to back it is clearly evident. This movie shows that story and features the entire album explaining the story. The main character, coincidentally, is named Pink. The story basically shows the process from when he was a child up to his adulthood how he got trapped behind a "wall" of isolation from society. Each song/part of the movie represents the "bricks" that make up that wall. Any true Pink Floyd fan has to watch. This movie merely confirms the true genius of Pink Floyd. I gave it a 9 out of 10.

    Even though I'm a large fan of Pink Floyd, and The Wall being the first album I ever listened to, I still find this movie to be overrated. Probably the main problem that plagues this film is the symbolism-it's overly pretentious. In the iconic "Another Brick in the Wall II" segment, students are filed into a maze that leads to a giant meat grinder under the supervision of their evil Scottish teacher. What exactly LEAD into this? A simple embarrassment in front of the class. And there's Geldof himself-it's alright when he doesn't talk, but his voice-and his grotesque face-just don't fit the tone of the movie. This said, it's actually pretty funny to see him scream "STO-OP!". Like I said, it's just not a faithful adaptation of the album. It CAN be done-there's concert footage planned for use in the film that suits it PERFECTLY-but here, it's just mediocre at best.

    Even the cast and crew hated this movie. WHY. I find this one of the greatest movies of all time. I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd and The Wall is my favorite album of theirs. The film follows the story of Pink who is based on Roger Waters and Syd Barrett. He decides to completely isolate himself from the world ("his wall") which he has been contemplating since his birth after his father died during Operation Shingle in Anzio during World War II (When the Tigers Broke Free, Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1 and Bring the Boys Back Home), the cruel treatment by his teachers (The Happiest Days of our Lives and Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2) and his wife's affair (One of My Turns, Don't Leave Me Now and Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3). There is almost no dialogue and is told through Pink Floyd's music. The films is directed by Alan Parker (Angel Heart, Mississippi Burning, Evita and Angela's Ashes) and stars: Bob Geldof (Spice World), Christine Hargreaves (Coronation Street, An American Werewolf in London and 1984), Eleanor David (The Scarlet Pimpernel, Comfort and Joy and 84 Charring Cross Road), Alex McAvoy (Country Dance, The Massacre of Glencoe and Strictly Sinatra), Bob Hoskins (Brazil, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Hook and Enemy at the Gates) and Michael Ensign (General Hospital, Ghostbusters, Titanic and Seabiscuit). There are two new songs: When the Tigers Broke Free and What Shall We Do Now? (I think When the Tigers Broke Free should have been on the album) and two songs on the album that weren't in the movie: Hey You and The Show Must Go On a scene for Hey You was filmed but not included in the movie you can watch the scene in the special features on the DVD(I think it should have been included in the movie). Rating 9/10 stars MPAA Rating: R for Disturbing Violent Images, Strong Sexuality and Drug Use, Nudity, Mature Thematic Elements and Brief Language

    I recall seeing The Wall at the midnight movies a few times, and I found it quite depressing. Let's face it, the movie, The Wall is a sad and depressing movie about Pink. He is basically depressed to the point of being catatonic, and he spends most of the movie just sitting with a cigarette in his hand. The rest of it is mostly in his mind. So what do I think this movie is worth a 10? If you just look at The Wall as a bunch of music videos, it is pretty good. Bob Geldof, who plays Pink, was not any great actor. He was the singer for the Boomtown Rats, and he is probably in this movie because he looks like a depressed and unhappy fellow. So we cannot really judge The Wall on the acting. It is about songs and short bits. The teacher yelling at the young Pink is a great little video that goes with the song Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2. In The Flesh has a great bit of video. So, if you really want to enjoy this movie, I suggest that you just enjoy the music, and look at it as a big music video.

    We have the rock star Pink, who spends much of the movie sitting in his apartment, unresponsively watching a television set. We see flashbacks or fantasies, of bomber-filled skies during World War Two, memories of his childhood with his overprotective mother and of the school he went to as a child, adult memories of his tuning out his wife, who leaves him for another man, a sudden "turn" where he acts violently and smashing everything in his apartment, animations involving fascism and a wall, himself as a fascist leader. He only comes to life when a bunch of people have to give him a drug injection so he can perform a concert show. The movie is based on Pink Floyd's super-hit album "The Wall", though one song is referenced that wasn't in the album. But what does the movie represent? Pink has as much character as a department store mannequin, and we don't really find out anything about him, or why he is such a passive character. Burned out on drugs, or fame? Really, the movie is a whole bunch of images (often repeated), and the whole isn't greater than the sum of its parts.

    A right-brained pity parade with pop hooks. Most people aren't going to have the patience to make sense of it; you can't really blame them, it's easier to let the images wash over you (which are pretty unpleasant). Trying to really get into this is like the scene with Pink rearranging hotel room debris in schizo patterns...would you really *want* to understand? There's definitely a method to the madness, though. Its not as incoherent as it seems. The album is like listening to a musical suicide note & the movie is like being inside a suicide's brain, every run on thought & recollection recreated in kaleidscopic detail. Along with Gerald Scarfe's delirious cartoons it's an epic montage of misery; words can't really describe it. In the end you can forgive it's miserablism, its earned & most others on the same wavelength don't have the same sheer visual inventiveness, anyway. It's possibly the greatest music video ever made. Mental disintegration is the perfect topic for this medium. THE WALL is about a depressed rock star, reviewing his life through a drugged out haze in every ugly detail.The kind of life summary someone hitting rock bottom makes. Everything is pain & darkness, fresh trauma waiting around every corner. It's the visual equivalent of Edvard Munch's Scream painting (which the movie poster riffs on). One long wail of despair, it's only interested in the hellish depths, the kind of flick you don't put on often. Negating everything is the first step to accepting everything, however. Here, the journey through Pink's subconscious is set to song. It's Roger Water's MTV therapy session & would be a total waste of time if he wasn't so masochistically honest about what a f*cked up human being he/we are. It's so harsh that it denies the truth of anything except pain, sweeping up much in its wake- mothers/lovers school fascism war - the whole convoluted system that sends people into these suicidal spirals by trying to mold them from day 1. They're not separable. It's in that spirit of total negation that someone can really bare to look closely at these things...paint it black. What stands out in this operatic fever dream? Sarcastic schoolyard anthems, masked children on conveyor belts ground to paste, cruel teachers, self mutilating rock stars laying waste to mankind, screwing flowers, towering walls, trials & talking asses, explosions, worms, dead staring eyes- Its amazing how everything gets a call-out, a big summing up. It's all here. Fatherless boys & castrating mothers, goose stepping & falling bombs...this stuff is great. Roger Waters is a d*ick but Roger Waters also has balls to be retracing his steps through the labyrinth like he does here, It's not either/or. Exposing your inner dictator isn't a walk in the park. I'm really glad for movies like this, not only does it recreate what a nervous breakdown can feel like but goes further & holistically ties it back into society with the totalitarian stuff. Pink is a microcosm. The wall itself makes me think of Wilhelm Reich's body armor idea, the muscular shielding people build to live in emotional war zones which quickly deadens them to *any* feeling. That in turn leads to things like shooting heroin, screwing groupies & committing mass murder to feel alive again (its utterly perfect how after the wall crashes only children are left, scrounging through wreckage). Critics who complained the film lacked resolution are dead wrong. It's great that someone made the connection for rock audiences between pop stardom & fascist demagoguery, too. It's done in a way where you're not sure whether to chuckle or quake. The hammer & sickle pageant that erupts into rioting while an exhilarating melody plays has to be the most jaw dropping moment I've seen in a musical. You feel guilty for getting into the tune with beatings & rapes on-screen, the racial slurs & skinned heads. Its blood curdling & absurd. Way to turn a cherished form inside out & shovel its steaming guts in the faces of the fans you hate, Roger. That's entertainment! There's worse sins than trying to shovel everything & the kitchen sink in but the album/movie wants to articulate the agony of it all so completely that it gets numbing quick, a constant bludgeon of horror & despair, the ultimate bad trip flick. It can be overwhelming if you're not prepared. The music provides the characters, the story, everything else is really just a framework for an apocalyptic day dream. I love Pink Floyd. Along with Radiohead they made the scariest rock music I've heard. I never connected much with pop until I heard these guys. THE WALL is the last album where the group was firing even close to all cylinders, half brilliant & half awful. I don't need these kind of pitch black tunes as much now but it was sure comforting when I did. Standout image: hard to choose just one but probably the flower devouring her mate. Best song: again hard but likely 'Comfortably Numb', which oughta be the rock anthem of the whole 20th century

    The album by Pink Floyd known as "The Wall" is a concept album which tells a story from beginning to end. While listening to only a few songs, it's hard to tell. But back to back it is clearly evident. This movie shows that story and features the entire album explaining the story. The main character, coincidentally, is named Pink. The story basically shows the process from when he was a child up to his adulthood how he got trapped behind a "wall" of isolation from society. Each song/part of the movie represents the "bricks" that make up that wall. Any true Pink Floyd fan has to watch. This movie merely confirms the true genius of Pink Floyd. I gave it a 9 out of 10.

    Even though I'm a large fan of Pink Floyd, and The Wall being the first album I ever listened to, I still find this movie to be overrated. Probably the main problem that plagues this film is the symbolism-it's overly pretentious. In the iconic "Another Brick in the Wall II" segment, students are filed into a maze that leads to a giant meat grinder under the supervision of their evil Scottish teacher. What exactly LEAD into this? A simple embarrassment in front of the class. And there's Geldof himself-it's alright when he doesn't talk, but his voice-and his grotesque face-just don't fit the tone of the movie. This said, it's actually pretty funny to see him scream "STO-OP!". Like I said, it's just not a faithful adaptation of the album. It CAN be done-there's concert footage planned for use in the film that suits it PERFECTLY-but here, it's just mediocre at best.

    Even the cast and crew hated this movie. WHY. I find this one of the greatest movies of all time. I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd and The Wall is my favorite album of theirs. The film follows the story of Pink who is based on Roger Waters and Syd Barrett. He decides to completely isolate himself from the world ("his wall") which he has been contemplating since his birth after his father died during Operation Shingle in Anzio during World War II (When the Tigers Broke Free, Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1 and Bring the Boys Back Home), the cruel treatment by his teachers (The Happiest Days of our Lives and Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2) and his wife's affair (One of My Turns, Don't Leave Me Now and Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3). There is almost no dialogue and is told through Pink Floyd's music. The films is directed by Alan Parker (Angel Heart, Mississippi Burning, Evita and Angela's Ashes) and stars: Bob Geldof (Spice World), Christine Hargreaves (Coronation Street, An American Werewolf in London and 1984), Eleanor David (The Scarlet Pimpernel, Comfort and Joy and 84 Charring Cross Road), Alex McAvoy (Country Dance, The Massacre of Glencoe and Strictly Sinatra), Bob Hoskins (Brazil, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Hook and Enemy at the Gates) and Michael Ensign (General Hospital, Ghostbusters, Titanic and Seabiscuit). There are two new songs: When the Tigers Broke Free and What Shall We Do Now? (I think When the Tigers Broke Free should have been on the album) and two songs on the album that weren't in the movie: Hey You and The Show Must Go On a scene for Hey You was filmed but not included in the movie you can watch the scene in the special features on the DVD(I think it should have been included in the movie). Rating 9/10 stars MPAA Rating: R for Disturbing Violent Images, Strong Sexuality and Drug Use, Nudity, Mature Thematic Elements and Brief Language

    Pink Floyd began to reach its heyday when rock-and-roll music was still viewed as "the devil's music" and was negatively received in circles outside of its core fanbase. Let it be known and heard that the band's cult film Pink Floyd: The Wall has more knowledgeable and thought-provoking things to say than anything any of those circles ever said. The film is a deafening, absolutely incomparable movie-experience and an aesthetic and narrative breakthrough for music-documentaries. The film doesn't assume the basic qualities of conventional rock-documentaries, not becoming a concert-film or profiling a band and getting down to what makes them unique and noteworthy. It destroys conventionality within the genre, assuming the qualities of startling and powerful impressionistic and expressionistic cinema simultaneously. The Wall assumes a loose narrative, following Pink (Bob Geldof), the increasingly detached narrator of the film who has wicked, often explicit hallucinations. His hallucinations feature violent depictions of war, disturbing videos of children singing harmoniously to music, and many others that I do not want to spoil. The film is only disjointed if that's how you choose to view it, meaning if you seek to find meaning and piece together its small vignettes into something larger and more universal, you'll have an effective picture in terms or thematic relevance. If you watch the film solely for the images, sound, music, and content, then you get the expressionism I spoke of earlier. Ultimately, the film's central theme - at least in my eyes - is self-destruction, from a domestic and global perspective in addition to a more personal one. Its constant images of violence, torment, and the dehumanization of children can effectively state that the film's central ideas deal with that of destruction from the inside rather than outside forces. Combined with these live-action and animated clips (brilliantly directed by Gerald Scarfe) are the songs of Floyd's enigmatic masterwork of an album The Wall, which was released in 1979. Rarely has rock music achieved heights these high. Rarely have themes such as isolation, desperation, and self-destruction been so prominent and affecting on the viewer. At ninety-five minutes long, Pink Floyd: The Wall has the impact of an epic, and works on levels from an excellent portrait of a rock album to a compelling and elusive tone-poem on the state of the America and the common man. Starring: Bob Geldof. Directed by Alan Parker and Gerald Scarfe (animated scenes only).

    I've been a fan of Pink Floyd since the seventies and in particular love The Wall album, which was based on Roger Waters feelings of boredom and alienation during massive American tours in the late seventies and has flashbacks to his brutal treatment at school in the fifties. The film, a musical with little dialogue and mostly made up of Pink Floyd tunes, sees Bob Geldof play Pink, a burned out rock star who is going insane in his hotel room. Also there are flashbacks to the fifties of how Pink, well Waters really, became a rock star by writing lyrics to what would become Pink Floyd songs during school lessons to the dismay of his teachers, who are shown up as sadistic buffoons. Later in the film Pink, high on drugs, descends into madness and smashes up his hotel room and attacks a groupie. When he is sedated and drifts into a deep sleep, Bob Hoskins has a decent cameo as his manager, Pink dreams he has become a fascist leader at a mass rally similar to a huge concert, but with the difference that the music is inciting hatred and violence. ( While you might wonder what this has to do with a left leaning figure like Waters, he was highly critical of the extreme Right and nationalism on The Wall). Finally the film ends with Pink being trapped behind a huge wall. OK non fans will hate it, as you have to have a deep understanding of Roger Waters mindset in 1979 and what inspired the film and album, but for all fans of Waters and Pink Floyd, The Wall is a must see film.

    I recently really discovered Pink Floyd's music (yeah, I know) and The Wall is one of my favorite albums from them, and when I heard it was a film I did think it would be something like what I got. It's rich in symbolism and there's a lot here that surely went over my head, but for the most part even when you're totally lost at what it's trying to tell you there's a lot to enjoy. The music taken at face-value is amazing as it is, so in that way it works, but some segments are more noticeably stronger than others. The final ten minutes are haunting and never really let you gasp for air, and in that intoxicating sense it's able to fully fledge in your memory.

    Roger Waters didn't like it. The director Alan Parker didn't like it. Animation designer Gerald Scarfe didn't like it. David Gilmour didn't like it as much as the album and the concert. So is Pink Floyd The Wall bad? No. Is it good then? Sort of. It certainly isn't great. This live-action/animated musical follows Pink, a rock star, who isolates himself from the world and slowly goes mad. The first thing you notice about the movie is that its strange narrative structure was clearly influenced by the whole surrealist movement. While this fits some parts of the whole The Wall concept perfectly, some parts are also rather messy  especially in the first act. In spite of it being fairly messy (direction wise) Pink Floyd The Wall isn't hard to follow, particularly if you're familiar with the album. It doesn't take a genius to understand the movie. Let's just take the musical aspect of the movie out of the way. The music is undoubtedly good, after all it is one of the most famous Pink Floyd albums. But if you're interested in the music, one might ask why not just listen to the album instead of watching the movie. One may also argue that the The Wall concept is pretty detailed on the album and that this story doesn't need to be told through another medium. That being said, I didn't like some songs in the movie. And by some songs I primarily mean the usage of When the Tigers Broke Free. During the segments that use this song, I couldn't shake the feeling that this song was written simply to tie the movie together. I know that it was written at the same time as The Wall, but I couldn't help to feel otherwise  the song was narrating what was happening in the movie. I found that to be sloppy and unnecessary. I don't need narrative exposition for something I can see with my own eyes. Also, the main actor Bob Geldof, who is the lead singer of The Boomtown Rats, couldn't do a satisfying Waters impression throughout his singing parts. So that's another reason to just listen to the album instead. Considering the whole movie is pretty much a 90 minute music video for the album and that everyone who listens to Pink Floyd (the movie's primary audience) is acquainted with The Wall concept, I won't spend much time analyzing the story. I'll just say I fully agree with Waters when he said that the movie doesn't let the audience sympathize with Pink. It's also very strange that the movie has so many anti war elements when the album hasn't. The Final Cut, the album which came out a year after this movie, has much more anti war propaganda than The Wall. Anyway, as I said, much of the story is being told through Pink Floyd songs. Since the movie isn't so story driven, I should mention the visuals. The animation is perfect, it's full of beautifully twisted pictures that often resemble an LSD trip. The cinematography is also stunning, mostly during the Another Brick in The Wall Pt 2 segment. Basically, the movie is worth watching based on visuals alone. And if you're a big Pink Floyd fan you'll enjoy this strange experience that is Pink Floyd The Wall even more. Rating: 7/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com

The films is directed by Alan Parker (Angel Heart, Mississippi Burning, Evita and Angela's Ashes) and stars: Bob Geldof (Spice World), Christine Hargreaves (Coronation Street, An American Werewolf in London and 1984), Eleanor David (The Scarlet Pimpernel, Comfort and Joy and 84 Charring Cross Road), Alex McAvoy (Country Dance, The Massacre of Glencoe and Strictly Sinatra), Bob Hoskins (Brazil, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Hook and Enemy at the Gates) and Michael Ensign (General Hospital, Ghostbusters, Titanic and Seabiscuit). There are two new songs: When the Tigers Broke Free and What Shall We Do Now? (I think When the Tigers Broke Free should have been on the album) and two songs on the album that weren't in the movie: Hey You and The Show Must Go On a scene for Hey You was filmed but not included in the movie you can watch the scene in the special features on the DVD(I think it should have been included in the movie).

    Pink Floyd began to reach its heyday when rock-and-roll music was still viewed as "the devil's music" and was negatively received in circles outside of its core fanbase. Let it be known and heard that the band's cult film Pink Floyd: The Wall has more knowledgeable and thought-provoking things to say than anything any of those circles ever said. The film is a deafening, absolutely incomparable movie-experience and an aesthetic and narrative breakthrough for music-documentaries. The film doesn't assume the basic qualities of conventional rock-documentaries, not becoming a concert-film or profiling a band and getting down to what makes them unique and noteworthy. It destroys conventionality within the genre, assuming the qualities of startling and powerful impressionistic and expressionistic cinema simultaneously. The Wall assumes a loose narrative, following Pink (Bob Geldof), the increasingly detached narrator of the film who has wicked, often explicit hallucinations. His hallucinations feature violent depictions of war, disturbing videos of children singing harmoniously to music, and many others that I do not want to spoil. The film is only disjointed if that's how you choose to view it, meaning if you seek to find meaning and piece together its small vignettes into something larger and more universal, you'll have an effective picture in terms or thematic relevance. If you watch the film solely for the images, sound, music, and content, then you get the expressionism I spoke of earlier. Ultimately, the film's central theme - at least in my eyes - is self-destruction, from a domestic and global perspective in addition to a more personal one. Its constant images of violence, torment, and the dehumanization of children can effectively state that the film's central ideas deal with that of destruction from the inside rather than outside forces. Combined with these live-action and animated clips (brilliantly directed by Gerald Scarfe) are the songs of Floyd's enigmatic masterwork of an album The Wall, which was released in 1979. Rarely has rock music achieved heights these high. Rarely have themes such as isolation, desperation, and self-destruction been so prominent and affecting on the viewer. At ninety-five minutes long, Pink Floyd: The Wall has the impact of an epic, and works on levels from an excellent portrait of a rock album to a compelling and elusive tone-poem on the state of the America and the common man. Starring: Bob Geldof. Directed by Alan Parker and Gerald Scarfe (animated scenes only).

    I've been a fan of Pink Floyd since the seventies and in particular love The Wall album, which was based on Roger Waters feelings of boredom and alienation during massive American tours in the late seventies and has flashbacks to his brutal treatment at school in the fifties. The film, a musical with little dialogue and mostly made up of Pink Floyd tunes, sees Bob Geldof play Pink, a burned out rock star who is going insane in his hotel room. Also there are flashbacks to the fifties of how Pink, well Waters really, became a rock star by writing lyrics to what would become Pink Floyd songs during school lessons to the dismay of his teachers, who are shown up as sadistic buffoons. Later in the film Pink, high on drugs, descends into madness and smashes up his hotel room and attacks a groupie. When he is sedated and drifts into a deep sleep, Bob Hoskins has a decent cameo as his manager, Pink dreams he has become a fascist leader at a mass rally similar to a huge concert, but with the difference that the music is inciting hatred and violence. ( While you might wonder what this has to do with a left leaning figure like Waters, he was highly critical of the extreme Right and nationalism on The Wall). Finally the film ends with Pink being trapped behind a huge wall. OK non fans will hate it, as you have to have a deep understanding of Roger Waters mindset in 1979 and what inspired the film and album, but for all fans of Waters and Pink Floyd, The Wall is a must see film.

    I recently really discovered Pink Floyd's music (yeah, I know) and The Wall is one of my favorite albums from them, and when I heard it was a film I did think it would be something like what I got. It's rich in symbolism and there's a lot here that surely went over my head, but for the most part even when you're totally lost at what it's trying to tell you there's a lot to enjoy. The music taken at face-value is amazing as it is, so in that way it works, but some segments are more noticeably stronger than others. The final ten minutes are haunting and never really let you gasp for air, and in that intoxicating sense it's able to fully fledge in your memory.

    Roger Waters didn't like it. The director Alan Parker didn't like it. Animation designer Gerald Scarfe didn't like it. David Gilmour didn't like it as much as the album and the concert. So is Pink Floyd The Wall bad? No. Is it good then? Sort of. It certainly isn't great. This live-action/animated musical follows Pink, a rock star, who isolates himself from the world and slowly goes mad. The first thing you notice about the movie is that its strange narrative structure was clearly influenced by the whole surrealist movement. While this fits some parts of the whole The Wall concept perfectly, some parts are also rather messy  especially in the first act. In spite of it being fairly messy (direction wise) Pink Floyd The Wall isn't hard to follow, particularly if you're familiar with the album. It doesn't take a genius to understand the movie. Let's just take the musical aspect of the movie out of the way. The music is undoubtedly good, after all it is one of the most famous Pink Floyd albums. But if you're interested in the music, one might ask why not just listen to the album instead of watching the movie. One may also argue that the The Wall concept is pretty detailed on the album and that this story doesn't need to be told through another medium. That being said, I didn't like some songs in the movie. And by some songs I primarily mean the usage of When the Tigers Broke Free. During the segments that use this song, I couldn't shake the feeling that this song was written simply to tie the movie together. I know that it was written at the same time as The Wall, but I couldn't help to feel otherwise  the song was narrating what was happening in the movie. I found that to be sloppy and unnecessary. I don't need narrative exposition for something I can see with my own eyes. Also, the main actor Bob Geldof, who is the lead singer of The Boomtown Rats, couldn't do a satisfying Waters impression throughout his singing parts. So that's another reason to just listen to the album instead. Considering the whole movie is pretty much a 90 minute music video for the album and that everyone who listens to Pink Floyd (the movie's primary audience) is acquainted with The Wall concept, I won't spend much time analyzing the story. I'll just say I fully agree with Waters when he said that the movie doesn't let the audience sympathize with Pink. It's also very strange that the movie has so many anti war elements when the album hasn't. The Final Cut, the album which came out a year after this movie, has much more anti war propaganda than The Wall. Anyway, as I said, much of the story is being told through Pink Floyd songs. Since the movie isn't so story driven, I should mention the visuals. The animation is perfect, it's full of beautifully twisted pictures that often resemble an LSD trip. The cinematography is also stunning, mostly during the Another Brick in The Wall Pt 2 segment. Basically, the movie is worth watching based on visuals alone. And if you're a big Pink Floyd fan you'll enjoy this strange experience that is Pink Floyd The Wall even more. Rating: 7/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com

    I recall seeing The Wall at the midnight movies a few times, and I found it quite depressing. Let's face it, the movie, The Wall is a sad and depressing movie about Pink. He is basically depressed to the point of being catatonic, and he spends most of the movie just sitting with a cigarette in his hand. The rest of it is mostly in his mind. So what do I think this movie is worth a 10? If you just look at The Wall as a bunch of music videos, it is pretty good. Bob Geldof, who plays Pink, was not any great actor. He was the singer for the Boomtown Rats, and he is probably in this movie because he looks like a depressed and unhappy fellow. So we cannot really judge The Wall on the acting. It is about songs and short bits. The teacher yelling at the young Pink is a great little video that goes with the song Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2. In The Flesh has a great bit of video. So, if you really want to enjoy this movie, I suggest that you just enjoy the music, and look at it as a big music video.

    We have the rock star Pink, who spends much of the movie sitting in his apartment, unresponsively watching a television set. We see flashbacks or fantasies, of bomber-filled skies during World War Two, memories of his childhood with his overprotective mother and of the school he went to as a child, adult memories of his tuning out his wife, who leaves him for another man, a sudden "turn" where he acts violently and smashing everything in his apartment, animations involving fascism and a wall, himself as a fascist leader. He only comes to life when a bunch of people have to give him a drug injection so he can perform a concert show. The movie is based on Pink Floyd's super-hit album "The Wall", though one song is referenced that wasn't in the album. But what does the movie represent? Pink has as much character as a department store mannequin, and we don't really find out anything about him, or why he is such a passive character. Burned out on drugs, or fame? Really, the movie is a whole bunch of images (often repeated), and the whole isn't greater than the sum of its parts.

    A right-brained pity parade with pop hooks. Most people aren't going to have the patience to make sense of it; you can't really blame them, it's easier to let the images wash over you (which are pretty unpleasant). Trying to really get into this is like the scene with Pink rearranging hotel room debris in schizo patterns...would you really *want* to understand? There's definitely a method to the madness, though. Its not as incoherent as it seems. The album is like listening to a musical suicide note & the movie is like being inside a suicide's brain, every run on thought & recollection recreated in kaleidscopic detail. Along with Gerald Scarfe's delirious cartoons it's an epic montage of misery; words can't really describe it. In the end you can forgive it's miserablism, its earned & most others on the same wavelength don't have the same sheer visual inventiveness, anyway. It's possibly the greatest music video ever made. Mental disintegration is the perfect topic for this medium. THE WALL is about a depressed rock star, reviewing his life through a drugged out haze in every ugly detail.The kind of life summary someone hitting rock bottom makes. Everything is pain & darkness, fresh trauma waiting around every corner. It's the visual equivalent of Edvard Munch's Scream painting (which the movie poster riffs on). One long wail of despair, it's only interested in the hellish depths, the kind of flick you don't put on often. Negating everything is the first step to accepting everything, however. Here, the journey through Pink's subconscious is set to song. It's Roger Water's MTV therapy session & would be a total waste of time if he wasn't so masochistically honest about what a f*cked up human being he/we are. It's so harsh that it denies the truth of anything except pain, sweeping up much in its wake- mothers/lovers school fascism war - the whole convoluted system that sends people into these suicidal spirals by trying to mold them from day 1. They're not separable. It's in that spirit of total negation that someone can really bare to look closely at these things...paint it black. What stands out in this operatic fever dream? Sarcastic schoolyard anthems, masked children on conveyor belts ground to paste, cruel teachers, self mutilating rock stars laying waste to mankind, screwing flowers, towering walls, trials & talking asses, explosions, worms, dead staring eyes- Its amazing how everything gets a call-out, a big summing up. It's all here. Fatherless boys & castrating mothers, goose stepping & falling bombs...this stuff is great. Roger Waters is a d*ick but Roger Waters also has balls to be retracing his steps through the labyrinth like he does here, It's not either/or. Exposing your inner dictator isn't a walk in the park. I'm really glad for movies like this, not only does it recreate what a nervous breakdown can feel like but goes further & holistically ties it back into society with the totalitarian stuff. Pink is a microcosm. The wall itself makes me think of Wilhelm Reich's body armor idea, the muscular shielding people build to live in emotional war zones which quickly deadens them to *any* feeling. That in turn leads to things like shooting heroin, screwing groupies & committing mass murder to feel alive again (its utterly perfect how after the wall crashes only children are left, scrounging through wreckage). Critics who complained the film lacked resolution are dead wrong. It's great that someone made the connection for rock audiences between pop stardom & fascist demagoguery, too. It's done in a way where you're not sure whether to chuckle or quake. The hammer & sickle pageant that erupts into rioting while an exhilarating melody plays has to be the most jaw dropping moment I've seen in a musical. You feel guilty for getting into the tune with beatings & rapes on-screen, the racial slurs & skinned heads. Its blood curdling & absurd. Way to turn a cherished form inside out & shovel its steaming guts in the faces of the fans you hate, Roger. That's entertainment! There's worse sins than trying to shovel everything & the kitchen sink in but the album/movie wants to articulate the agony of it all so completely that it gets numbing quick, a constant bludgeon of horror & despair, the ultimate bad trip flick. It can be overwhelming if you're not prepared. The music provides the characters, the story, everything else is really just a framework for an apocalyptic day dream. I love Pink Floyd. Along with Radiohead they made the scariest rock music I've heard. I never connected much with pop until I heard these guys. THE WALL is the last album where the group was firing even close to all cylinders, half brilliant & half awful. I don't need these kind of pitch black tunes as much now but it was sure comforting when I did. Standout image: hard to choose just one but probably the flower devouring her mate. Best song: again hard but likely 'Comfortably Numb', which oughta be the rock anthem of the whole 20th century

    The album by Pink Floyd known as "The Wall" is a concept album which tells a story from beginning to end. While listening to only a few songs, it's hard to tell. But back to back it is clearly evident. This movie shows that story and features the entire album explaining the story. The main character, coincidentally, is named Pink. The story basically shows the process from when he was a child up to his adulthood how he got trapped behind a "wall" of isolation from society. Each song/part of the movie represents the "bricks" that make up that wall. Any true Pink Floyd fan has to watch. This movie merely confirms the true genius of Pink Floyd. I gave it a 9 out of 10.

    Even though I'm a large fan of Pink Floyd, and The Wall being the first album I ever listened to, I still find this movie to be overrated. Probably the main problem that plagues this film is the symbolism-it's overly pretentious. In the iconic "Another Brick in the Wall II" segment, students are filed into a maze that leads to a giant meat grinder under the supervision of their evil Scottish teacher. What exactly LEAD into this? A simple embarrassment in front of the class. And there's Geldof himself-it's alright when he doesn't talk, but his voice-and his grotesque face-just don't fit the tone of the movie. This said, it's actually pretty funny to see him scream "STO-OP!". Like I said, it's just not a faithful adaptation of the album. It CAN be done-there's concert footage planned for use in the film that suits it PERFECTLY-but here, it's just mediocre at best.

    Even the cast and crew hated this movie. WHY. I find this one of the greatest movies of all time. I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd and The Wall is my favorite album of theirs. The film follows the story of Pink who is based on Roger Waters and Syd Barrett. He decides to completely isolate himself from the world ("his wall") which he has been contemplating since his birth after his father died during Operation Shingle in Anzio during World War II (When the Tigers Broke Free, Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1 and Bring the Boys Back Home), the cruel treatment by his teachers (The Happiest Days of our Lives and Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2) and his wife's affair (One of My Turns, Don't Leave Me Now and Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3). There is almost no dialogue and is told through Pink Floyd's music. The films is directed by Alan Parker (Angel Heart, Mississippi Burning, Evita and Angela's Ashes) and stars: Bob Geldof (Spice World), Christine Hargreaves (Coronation Street, An American Werewolf in London and 1984), Eleanor David (The Scarlet Pimpernel, Comfort and Joy and 84 Charring Cross Road), Alex McAvoy (Country Dance, The Massacre of Glencoe and Strictly Sinatra), Bob Hoskins (Brazil, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Hook and Enemy at the Gates) and Michael Ensign (General Hospital, Ghostbusters, Titanic and Seabiscuit). There are two new songs: When the Tigers Broke Free and What Shall We Do Now? (I think When the Tigers Broke Free should have been on the album) and two songs on the album that weren't in the movie: Hey You and The Show Must Go On a scene for Hey You was filmed but not included in the movie you can watch the scene in the special features on the DVD(I think it should have been included in the movie).

He was the singer for the Boomtown Rats, and he is probably in this movie because he looks like a depressed and unhappy fellow. So we cannot really judge The Wall on the acting. It is about songs and short bits. The teacher yelling at the young Pink is a great little video that goes with the song Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2. In The Flesh has a great bit of video. So, if you really want to enjoy this movie, I suggest that you just enjoy the music, and look at it as a big music video.

    We have the rock star Pink, who spends much of the movie sitting in his apartment, unresponsively watching a television set. We see flashbacks or fantasies, of bomber-filled skies during World War Two, memories of his childhood with his overprotective mother and of the school he went to as a child, adult memories of his tuning out his wife, who leaves him for another man, a sudden "turn" where he acts violently and smashing everything in his apartment, animations involving fascism and a wall, himself as a fascist leader. He only comes to life when a bunch of people have to give him a drug injection so he can perform a concert show. The movie is based on Pink Floyd's super-hit album "The Wall", though one song is referenced that wasn't in the album. But what does the movie represent? Pink has as much character as a department store mannequin, and we don't really find out anything about him, or why he is such a passive character. Burned out on drugs, or fame? Really, the movie is a whole bunch of images (often repeated), and the whole isn't greater than the sum of its parts.

    A right-brained pity parade with pop hooks. Most people aren't going to have the patience to make sense of it; you can't really blame them, it's easier to let the images wash over you (which are pretty unpleasant). Trying to really get into this is like the scene with Pink rearranging hotel room debris in schizo patterns...would you really *want* to understand? There's definitely a method to the madness, though. Its not as incoherent as it seems. The album is like listening to a musical suicide note & the movie is like being inside a suicide's brain, every run on thought & recollection recreated in kaleidscopic detail. Along with Gerald Scarfe's delirious cartoons it's an epic montage of misery; words can't really describe it. In the end you can forgive it's miserablism, its earned & most others on the same wavelength don't have the same sheer visual inventiveness, anyway. It's possibly the greatest music video ever made. Mental disintegration is the perfect topic for this medium. THE WALL is about a depressed rock star, reviewing his life through a drugged out haze in every ugly detail.The kind of life summary someone hitting rock bottom makes. Everything is pain & darkness, fresh trauma waiting around every corner. It's the visual equivalent of Edvard Munch's Scream painting (which the movie poster riffs on). One long wail of despair, it's only interested in the hellish depths, the kind of flick you don't put on often. Negating everything is the first step to accepting everything, however. Here, the journey through Pink's subconscious is set to song. It's Roger Water's MTV therapy session & would be a total waste of time if he wasn't so masochistically honest about what a f*cked up human being he/we are. It's so harsh that it denies the truth of anything except pain, sweeping up much in its wake- mothers/lovers school fascism war - the whole convoluted system that sends people into these suicidal spirals by trying to mold them from day 1. They're not separable. It's in that spirit of total negation that someone can really bare to look closely at these things...paint it black. What stands out in this operatic fever dream? Sarcastic schoolyard anthems, masked children on conveyor belts ground to paste, cruel teachers, self mutilating rock stars laying waste to mankind, screwing flowers, towering walls, trials & talking asses, explosions, worms, dead staring eyes- Its amazing how everything gets a call-out, a big summing up. It's all here. Fatherless boys & castrating mothers, goose stepping & falling bombs...this stuff is great. Roger Waters is a d*ick but Roger Waters also has balls to be retracing his steps through the labyrinth like he does here, It's not either/or. Exposing your inner dictator isn't a walk in the park. I'm really glad for movies like this, not only does it recreate what a nervous breakdown can feel like but goes further & holistically ties it back into society with the totalitarian stuff. Pink is a microcosm. The wall itself makes me think of Wilhelm Reich's body armor idea, the muscular shielding people build to live in emotional war zones which quickly deadens them to *any* feeling. That in turn leads to things like shooting heroin, screwing groupies & committing mass murder to feel alive again (its utterly perfect how after the wall crashes only children are left, scrounging through wreckage). Critics who complained the film lacked resolution are dead wrong. It's great that someone made the connection for rock audiences between pop stardom & fascist demagoguery, too. It's done in a way where you're not sure whether to chuckle or quake. The hammer & sickle pageant that erupts into rioting while an exhilarating melody plays has to be the most jaw dropping moment I've seen in a musical. You feel guilty for getting into the tune with beatings & rapes on-screen, the racial slurs & skinned heads. Its blood curdling & absurd. Way to turn a cherished form inside out & shovel its steaming guts in the faces of the fans you hate, Roger. That's entertainment! There's worse sins than trying to shovel everything & the kitchen sink in but the album/movie wants to articulate the agony of it all so completely that it gets numbing quick, a constant bludgeon of horror & despair, the ultimate bad trip flick. It can be overwhelming if you're not prepared. The music provides the characters, the story, everything else is really just a framework for an apocalyptic day dream. I love Pink Floyd. Along with Radiohead they made the scariest rock music I've heard. I never connected much with pop until I heard these guys. THE WALL is the last album where the group was firing even close to all cylinders, half brilliant & half awful. I don't need these kind of pitch black tunes as much now but it was sure comforting when I did. Standout image: hard to choose just one but probably the flower devouring her mate. Best song: again hard but likely 'Comfortably Numb', which oughta be the rock anthem of the whole 20th century

    The album by Pink Floyd known as "The Wall" is a concept album which tells a story from beginning to end. While listening to only a few songs, it's hard to tell. But back to back it is clearly evident. This movie shows that story and features the entire album explaining the story. The main character, coincidentally, is named Pink. The story basically shows the process from when he was a child up to his adulthood how he got trapped behind a "wall" of isolation from society. Each song/part of the movie represents the "bricks" that make up that wall. Any true Pink Floyd fan has to watch. This movie merely confirms the true genius of Pink Floyd. I gave it a 9 out of 10.

    Even though I'm a large fan of Pink Floyd, and The Wall being the first album I ever listened to, I still find this movie to be overrated. Probably the main problem that plagues this film is the symbolism-it's overly pretentious. In the iconic "Another Brick in the Wall II" segment, students are filed into a maze that leads to a giant meat grinder under the supervision of their evil Scottish teacher. What exactly LEAD into this? A simple embarrassment in front of the class. And there's Geldof himself-it's alright when he doesn't talk, but his voice-and his grotesque face-just don't fit the tone of the movie. This said, it's actually pretty funny to see him scream "STO-OP!". Like I said, it's just not a faithful adaptation of the album. It CAN be done-there's concert footage planned for use in the film that suits it PERFECTLY-but here, it's just mediocre at best.

    Even the cast and crew hated this movie. WHY. I find this one of the greatest movies of all time. I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd and The Wall is my favorite album of theirs. The film follows the story of Pink who is based on Roger Waters and Syd Barrett. He decides to completely isolate himself from the world ("his wall") which he has been contemplating since his birth after his father died during Operation Shingle in Anzio during World War II (When the Tigers Broke Free, Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1 and Bring the Boys Back Home), the cruel treatment by his teachers (The Happiest Days of our Lives and Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2) and his wife's affair (One of My Turns, Don't Leave Me Now and Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3). There is almost no dialogue and is told through Pink Floyd's music. The films is directed by Alan Parker (Angel Heart, Mississippi Burning, Evita and Angela's Ashes) and stars: Bob Geldof (Spice World), Christine Hargreaves (Coronation Street, An American Werewolf in London and 1984), Eleanor David (The Scarlet Pimpernel, Comfort and Joy and 84 Charring Cross Road), Alex McAvoy (Country Dance, The Massacre of Glencoe and Strictly Sinatra), Bob Hoskins (Brazil, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Hook and Enemy at the Gates) and Michael Ensign (General Hospital, Ghostbusters, Titanic and Seabiscuit). There are two new songs: When the Tigers Broke Free and What Shall We Do Now? (I think When the Tigers Broke Free should have been on the album) and two songs on the album that weren't in the movie: Hey You and The Show Must Go On a scene for Hey You was filmed but not included in the movie you can watch the scene in the special features on the DVD(I think it should have been included in the movie). Rating 9/10 stars MPAA Rating: R for Disturbing Violent Images, Strong Sexuality and Drug Use, Nudity, Mature Thematic Elements and Brief Language

    Pink Floyd began to reach its heyday when rock-and-roll music was still viewed as "the devil's music" and was negatively received in circles outside of its core fanbase. Let it be known and heard that the band's cult film Pink Floyd: The Wall has more knowledgeable and thought-provoking things to say than anything any of those circles ever said. The film is a deafening, absolutely incomparable movie-experience and an aesthetic and narrative breakthrough for music-documentaries. The film doesn't assume the basic qualities of conventional rock-documentaries, not becoming a concert-film or profiling a band and getting down to what makes them unique and noteworthy. It destroys conventionality within the genre, assuming the qualities of startling and powerful impressionistic and expressionistic cinema simultaneously. The Wall assumes a loose narrative, following Pink (Bob Geldof), the increasingly detached narrator of the film who has wicked, often explicit hallucinations. His hallucinations feature violent depictions of war, disturbing videos of children singing harmoniously to music, and many others that I do not want to spoil. The film is only disjointed if that's how you choose to view it, meaning if you seek to find meaning and piece together its small vignettes into something larger and more universal, you'll have an effective picture in terms or thematic relevance. If you watch the film solely for the images, sound, music, and content, then you get the expressionism I spoke of earlier. Ultimately, the film's central theme - at least in my eyes - is self-destruction, from a domestic and global perspective in addition to a more personal one. Its constant images of violence, torment, and the dehumanization of children can effectively state that the film's central ideas deal with that of destruction from the inside rather than outside forces. Combined with these live-action and animated clips (brilliantly directed by Gerald Scarfe) are the songs of Floyd's enigmatic masterwork of an album The Wall, which was released in 1979. Rarely has rock music achieved heights these high. Rarely have themes such as isolation, desperation, and self-destruction been so prominent and affecting on the viewer. At ninety-five minutes long, Pink Floyd: The Wall has the impact of an epic, and works on levels from an excellent portrait of a rock album to a compelling and elusive tone-poem on the state of the America and the common man. Starring: Bob Geldof. Directed by Alan Parker and Gerald Scarfe (animated scenes only).

    I've been a fan of Pink Floyd since the seventies and in particular love The Wall album, which was based on Roger Waters feelings of boredom and alienation during massive American tours in the late seventies and has flashbacks to his brutal treatment at school in the fifties. The film, a musical with little dialogue and mostly made up of Pink Floyd tunes, sees Bob Geldof play Pink, a burned out rock star who is going insane in his hotel room. Also there are flashbacks to the fifties of how Pink, well Waters really, became a rock star by writing lyrics to what would become Pink Floyd songs during school lessons to the dismay of his teachers, who are shown up as sadistic buffoons. Later in the film Pink, high on drugs, descends into madness and smashes up his hotel room and attacks a groupie. When he is sedated and drifts into a deep sleep, Bob Hoskins has a decent cameo as his manager, Pink dreams he has become a fascist leader at a mass rally similar to a huge concert, but with the difference that the music is inciting hatred and violence. ( While you might wonder what this has to do with a left leaning figure like Waters, he was highly critical of the extreme Right and nationalism on The Wall). Finally the film ends with Pink being trapped behind a huge wall. OK non fans will hate it, as you have to have a deep understanding of Roger Waters mindset in 1979 and what inspired the film and album, but for all fans of Waters and Pink Floyd, The Wall is a must see film.

    I recently really discovered Pink Floyd's music (yeah, I know) and The Wall is one of my favorite albums from them, and when I heard it was a film I did think it would be something like what I got. It's rich in symbolism and there's a lot here that surely went over my head, but for the most part even when you're totally lost at what it's trying to tell you there's a lot to enjoy. The music taken at face-value is amazing as it is, so in that way it works, but some segments are more noticeably stronger than others. The final ten minutes are haunting and never really let you gasp for air, and in that intoxicating sense it's able to fully fledge in your memory.

    Roger Waters didn't like it. The director Alan Parker didn't like it. Animation designer Gerald Scarfe didn't like it. David Gilmour didn't like it as much as the album and the concert. So is Pink Floyd The Wall bad? No. Is it good then? Sort of. It certainly isn't great. This live-action/animated musical follows Pink, a rock star, who isolates himself from the world and slowly goes mad. The first thing you notice about the movie is that its strange narrative structure was clearly influenced by the whole surrealist movement. While this fits some parts of the whole The Wall concept perfectly, some parts are also rather messy  especially in the first act. In spite of it being fairly messy (direction wise) Pink Floyd The Wall isn't hard to follow, particularly if you're familiar with the album. It doesn't take a genius to understand the movie. Let's just take the musical aspect of the movie out of the way. The music is undoubtedly good, after all it is one of the most famous Pink Floyd albums. But if you're interested in the music, one might ask why not just listen to the album instead of watching the movie. One may also argue that the The Wall concept is pretty detailed on the album and that this story doesn't need to be told through another medium. That being said, I didn't like some songs in the movie. And by some songs I primarily mean the usage of When the Tigers Broke Free. During the segments that use this song, I couldn't shake the feeling that this song was written simply to tie the movie together. I know that it was written at the same time as The Wall, but I couldn't help to feel otherwise  the song was narrating what was happening in the movie. I found that to be sloppy and unnecessary. I don't need narrative exposition for something I can see with my own eyes. Also, the main actor Bob Geldof, who is the lead singer of The Boomtown Rats, couldn't do a satisfying Waters impression throughout his singing parts. So that's another reason to just listen to the album instead. Considering the whole movie is pretty much a 90 minute music video for the album and that everyone who listens to Pink Floyd (the movie's primary audience) is acquainted with The Wall concept, I won't spend much time analyzing the story. I'll just say I fully agree with Waters when he said that the movie doesn't let the audience sympathize with Pink. It's also very strange that the movie has so many anti war elements when the album hasn't. The Final Cut, the album which came out a year after this movie, has much more anti war propaganda than The Wall. Anyway, as I said, much of the story is being told through Pink Floyd songs. Since the movie isn't so story driven, I should mention the visuals. The animation is perfect, it's full of beautifully twisted pictures that often resemble an LSD trip. The cinematography is also stunning, mostly during the Another Brick in The Wall Pt 2 segment. Basically, the movie is worth watching based on visuals alone. And if you're a big Pink Floyd fan you'll enjoy this strange experience that is Pink Floyd The Wall even more. Rating: 7/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com

    I recall seeing The Wall at the midnight movies a few times, and I found it quite depressing. Let's face it, the movie, The Wall is a sad and depressing movie about Pink. He is basically depressed to the point of being catatonic, and he spends most of the movie just sitting with a cigarette in his hand. The rest of it is mostly in his mind. So what do I think this movie is worth a 10? If you just look at The Wall as a bunch of music videos, it is pretty good. Bob Geldof, who plays Pink, was not any great actor. He was the singer for the Boomtown Rats, and he is probably in this movie because he looks like a depressed and unhappy fellow. So we cannot really judge The Wall on the acting. It is about songs and short bits. The teacher yelling at the young Pink is a great little video that goes with the song Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2. In The Flesh has a great bit of video.

    Pink Floyd began to reach its heyday when rock-and-roll music was still viewed as "the devil's music" and was negatively received in circles outside of its core fanbase. Let it be known and heard that the band's cult film Pink Floyd: The Wall has more knowledgeable and thought-provoking things to say than anything any of those circles ever said. The film is a deafening, absolutely incomparable movie-experience and an aesthetic and narrative breakthrough for music-documentaries. The film doesn't assume the basic qualities of conventional rock-documentaries, not becoming a concert-film or profiling a band and getting down to what makes them unique and noteworthy. It destroys conventionality within the genre, assuming the qualities of startling and powerful impressionistic and expressionistic cinema simultaneously. The Wall assumes a loose narrative, following Pink (Bob Geldof), the increasingly detached narrator of the film who has wicked, often explicit hallucinations. His hallucinations feature violent depictions of war, disturbing videos of children singing harmoniously to music, and many others that I do not want to spoil. The film is only disjointed if that's how you choose to view it, meaning if you seek to find meaning and piece together its small vignettes into something larger and more universal, you'll have an effective picture in terms or thematic relevance. If you watch the film solely for the images, sound, music, and content, then you get the expressionism I spoke of earlier. Ultimately, the film's central theme - at least in my eyes - is self-destruction, from a domestic and global perspective in addition to a more personal one. Its constant images of violence, torment, and the dehumanization of children can effectively state that the film's central ideas deal with that of destruction from the inside rather than outside forces. Combined with these live-action and animated clips (brilliantly directed by Gerald Scarfe) are the songs of Floyd's enigmatic masterwork of an album The Wall, which was released in 1979. Rarely has rock music achieved heights these high. Rarely have themes such as isolation, desperation, and self-destruction been so prominent and affecting on the viewer. At ninety-five minutes long, Pink Floyd: The Wall has the impact of an epic, and works on levels from an excellent portrait of a rock album to a compelling and elusive tone-poem on the state of the America and the common man. Starring: Bob Geldof. Directed by Alan Parker and Gerald Scarfe (animated scenes only).

    I've been a fan of Pink Floyd since the seventies and in particular love The Wall album, which was based on Roger Waters feelings of boredom and alienation during massive American tours in the late seventies and has flashbacks to his brutal treatment at school in the fifties. The film, a musical with little dialogue and mostly made up of Pink Floyd tunes, sees Bob Geldof play Pink, a burned out rock star who is going insane in his hotel room. Also there are flashbacks to the fifties of how Pink, well Waters really, became a rock star by writing lyrics to what would become Pink Floyd songs during school lessons to the dismay of his teachers, who are shown up as sadistic buffoons. Later in the film Pink, high on drugs, descends into madness and smashes up his hotel room and attacks a groupie. When he is sedated and drifts into a deep sleep, Bob Hoskins has a decent cameo as his manager, Pink dreams he has become a fascist leader at a mass rally similar to a huge concert, but with the difference that the music is inciting hatred and violence. ( While you might wonder what this has to do with a left leaning figure like Waters, he was highly critical of the extreme Right and nationalism on The Wall). Finally the film ends with Pink being trapped behind a huge wall. OK non fans will hate it, as you have to have a deep understanding of Roger Waters mindset in 1979 and what inspired the film and album, but for all fans of Waters and Pink Floyd, The Wall is a must see film.

    I recently really discovered Pink Floyd's music (yeah, I know) and The Wall is one of my favorite albums from them, and when I heard it was a film I did think it would be something like what I got. It's rich in symbolism and there's a lot here that surely went over my head, but for the most part even when you're totally lost at what it's trying to tell you there's a lot to enjoy. The music taken at face-value is amazing as it is, so in that way it works, but some segments are more noticeably stronger than others. The final ten minutes are haunting and never really let you gasp for air, and in that intoxicating sense it's able to fully fledge in your memory.

    Roger Waters didn't like it. The director Alan Parker didn't like it. Animation designer Gerald Scarfe didn't like it. David Gilmour didn't like it as much as the album and the concert. So is Pink Floyd The Wall bad? No. Is it good then? Sort of. It certainly isn't great. This live-action/animated musical follows Pink, a rock star, who isolates himself from the world and slowly goes mad. The first thing you notice about the movie is that its strange narrative structure was clearly influenced by the whole surrealist movement. While this fits some parts of the whole The Wall concept perfectly, some parts are also rather messy  especially in the first act. In spite of it being fairly messy (direction wise) Pink Floyd The Wall isn't hard to follow, particularly if you're familiar with the album. It doesn't take a genius to understand the movie. Let's just take the musical aspect of the movie out of the way. The music is undoubtedly good, after all it is one of the most famous Pink Floyd albums. But if you're interested in the music, one might ask why not just listen to the album instead of watching the movie. One may also argue that the The Wall concept is pretty detailed on the album and that this story doesn't need to be told through another medium. That being said, I didn't like some songs in the movie. And by some songs I primarily mean the usage of When the Tigers Broke Free. During the segments that use this song, I couldn't shake the feeling that this song was written simply to tie the movie together. I know that it was written at the same time as The Wall, but I couldn't help to feel otherwise  the song was narrating what was happening in the movie. I found that to be sloppy and unnecessary. I don't need narrative exposition for something I can see with my own eyes. Also, the main actor Bob Geldof, who is the lead singer of The Boomtown Rats, couldn't do a satisfying Waters impression throughout his singing parts. So that's another reason to just listen to the album instead. Considering the whole movie is pretty much a 90 minute music video for the album and that everyone who listens to Pink Floyd (the movie's primary audience) is acquainted with The Wall concept, I won't spend much time analyzing the story. I'll just say I fully agree with Waters when he said that the movie doesn't let the audience sympathize with Pink. It's also very strange that the movie has so many anti war elements when the album hasn't. The Final Cut, the album which came out a year after this movie, has much more anti war propaganda than The Wall. Anyway, as I said, much of the story is being told through Pink Floyd songs. Since the movie isn't so story driven, I should mention the visuals. The animation is perfect, it's full of beautifully twisted pictures that often resemble an LSD trip. The cinematography is also stunning, mostly during the Another Brick in The Wall Pt 2 segment. Basically, the movie is worth watching based on visuals alone. And if you're a big Pink Floyd fan you'll enjoy this strange experience that is Pink Floyd The Wall even more. Rating: 7/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com

    I recall seeing The Wall at the midnight movies a few times, and I found it quite depressing. Let's face it, the movie, The Wall is a sad and depressing movie about Pink. He is basically depressed to the point of being catatonic, and he spends most of the movie just sitting with a cigarette in his hand. The rest of it is mostly in his mind. So what do I think this movie is worth a 10? If you just look at The Wall as a bunch of music videos, it is pretty good. Bob Geldof, who plays Pink, was not any great actor. He was the singer for the Boomtown Rats, and he is probably in this movie because he looks like a depressed and unhappy fellow. So we cannot really judge The Wall on the acting. It is about songs and short bits. The teacher yelling at the young Pink is a great little video that goes with the song Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2. In The Flesh has a great bit of video. So, if you really want to enjoy this movie, I suggest that you just enjoy the music, and look at it as a big music video.

    We have the rock star Pink, who spends much of the movie sitting in his apartment, unresponsively watching a television set. We see flashbacks or fantasies, of bomber-filled skies during World War Two, memories of his childhood with his overprotective mother and of the school he went to as a child, adult memories of his tuning out his wife, who leaves him for another man, a sudden "turn" where he acts violently and smashing everything in his apartment, animations involving fascism and a wall, himself as a fascist leader. He only comes to life when a bunch of people have to give him a drug injection so he can perform a concert show. The movie is based on Pink Floyd's super-hit album "The Wall", though one song is referenced that wasn't in the album. But what does the movie represent? Pink has as much character as a department store mannequin, and we don't really find out anything about him, or why he is such a passive character. Burned out on drugs, or fame? Really, the movie is a whole bunch of images (often repeated), and the whole isn't greater than the sum of its parts.

    A right-brained pity parade with pop hooks. Most people aren't going to have the patience to make sense of it; you can't really blame them, it's easier to let the images wash over you (which are pretty unpleasant). Trying to really get into this is like the scene with Pink rearranging hotel room debris in schizo patterns...would you really *want* to understand? There's definitely a method to the madness, though. Its not as incoherent as it seems. The album is like listening to a musical suicide note & the movie is like being inside a suicide's brain, every run on thought & recollection recreated in kaleidscopic detail. Along with Gerald Scarfe's delirious cartoons it's an epic montage of misery; words can't really describe it. In the end you can forgive it's miserablism, its earned & most others on the same wavelength don't have the same sheer visual inventiveness, anyway. It's possibly the greatest music video ever made. Mental disintegration is the perfect topic for this medium. THE WALL is about a depressed rock star, reviewing his life through a drugged out haze in every ugly detail.The kind of life summary someone hitting rock bottom makes. Everything is pain & darkness, fresh trauma waiting around every corner. It's the visual equivalent of Edvard Munch's Scream painting (which the movie poster riffs on). One long wail of despair, it's only interested in the hellish depths, the kind of flick you don't put on often. Negating everything is the first step to accepting everything, however. Here, the journey through Pink's subconscious is set to song. It's Roger Water's MTV therapy session & would be a total waste of time if he wasn't so masochistically honest about what a f*cked up human being he/we are. It's so harsh that it denies the truth of anything except pain, sweeping up much in its wake- mothers/lovers school fascism war - the whole convoluted system that sends people into these suicidal spirals by trying to mold them from day 1. They're not separable. It's in that spirit of total negation that someone can really bare to look closely at these things...paint it black. What stands out in this operatic fever dream? Sarcastic schoolyard anthems, masked children on conveyor belts ground to paste, cruel teachers, self mutilating rock stars laying waste to mankind, screwing flowers, towering walls, trials & talking asses, explosions, worms, dead staring eyes- Its amazing how everything gets a call-out, a big summing up. It's all here. Fatherless boys & castrating mothers, goose stepping & falling bombs...this stuff is great. Roger Waters is a d*ick but Roger Waters also has balls to be retracing his steps through the labyrinth like he does here, It's not either/or. Exposing your inner dictator isn't a walk in the park. I'm really glad for movies like this, not only does it recreate what a nervous breakdown can feel like but goes further & holistically ties it back into society with the totalitarian stuff. Pink is a microcosm. The wall itself makes me think of Wilhelm Reich's body armor idea, the muscular shielding people build to live in emotional war zones which quickly deadens them to *any* feeling. That in turn leads to things like shooting heroin, screwing groupies & committing mass murder to feel alive again (its utterly perfect how after the wall crashes only children are left, scrounging through wreckage). Critics who complained the film lacked resolution are dead wrong. It's great that someone made the connection for rock audiences between pop stardom & fascist demagoguery, too. It's done in a way where you're not sure whether to chuckle or quake. The hammer & sickle pageant that erupts into rioting while an exhilarating melody plays has to be the most jaw dropping moment I've seen in a musical. You feel guilty for getting into the tune with beatings & rapes on-screen, the racial slurs & skinned heads. Its blood curdling & absurd. Way to turn a cherished form inside out & shovel its steaming guts in the faces of the fans you hate, Roger. That's entertainment! There's worse sins than trying to shovel everything & the kitchen sink in but the album/movie wants to articulate the agony of it all so completely that it gets numbing quick, a constant bludgeon of horror & despair, the ultimate bad trip flick. It can be overwhelming if you're not prepared. The music provides the characters, the story, everything else is really just a framework for an apocalyptic day dream. I love Pink Floyd. Along with Radiohead they made the scariest rock music I've heard. I never connected much with pop until I heard these guys. THE WALL is the last album where the group was firing even close to all cylinders, half brilliant & half awful. I don't need these kind of pitch black tunes as much now but it was sure comforting when I did. Standout image: hard to choose just one but probably the flower devouring her mate. Best song: again hard but likely 'Comfortably Numb', which oughta be the rock anthem of the whole 20th century

    The album by Pink Floyd known as "The Wall" is a concept album which tells a story from beginning to end. While listening to only a few songs, it's hard to tell. But back to back it is clearly evident. This movie shows that story and features the entire album explaining the story. The main character, coincidentally, is named Pink. The story basically shows the process from when he was a child up to his adulthood how he got trapped behind a "wall" of isolation from society. Each song/part of the movie represents the "bricks" that make up that wall. Any true Pink Floyd fan has to watch. This movie merely confirms the true genius of Pink Floyd. I gave it a 9 out of 10.

    Even though I'm a large fan of Pink Floyd, and The Wall being the first album I ever listened to, I still find this movie to be overrated. Probably the main problem that plagues this film is the symbolism-it's overly pretentious. In the iconic "Another Brick in the Wall II" segment, students are filed into a maze that leads to a giant meat grinder under the supervision of their evil Scottish teacher. What exactly LEAD into this? A simple embarrassment in front of the class. And there's Geldof himself-it's alright when he doesn't talk, but his voice-and his grotesque face-just don't fit the tone of the movie. This said, it's actually pretty funny to see him scream "STO-OP!". Like I said, it's just not a faithful adaptation of the album. It CAN be done-there's concert footage planned for use in the film that suits it PERFECTLY-but here, it's just mediocre at best.

    Even the cast and crew hated this movie. WHY. I find this one of the greatest movies of all time. I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd and The Wall is my favorite album of theirs. The film follows the story of Pink who is based on Roger Waters and Syd Barrett. He decides to completely isolate himself from the world ("his wall") which he has been contemplating since his birth after his father died during Operation Shingle in Anzio during World War II (When the Tigers Broke Free, Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1 and Bring the Boys Back Home), the cruel treatment by his teachers (The Happiest Days of our Lives and Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2) and his wife's affair (One of My Turns, Don't Leave Me Now and Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3). There is almost no dialogue and is told through Pink Floyd's music. The films is directed by Alan Parker (Angel Heart, Mississippi Burning, Evita and Angela's Ashes) and stars: Bob Geldof (Spice World), Christine Hargreaves (Coronation Street, An American Werewolf in London and 1984), Eleanor David (The Scarlet Pimpernel, Comfort and Joy and 84 Charring Cross Road), Alex McAvoy (Country Dance, The Massacre of Glencoe and Strictly Sinatra), Bob Hoskins (Brazil, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Hook and Enemy at the Gates) and Michael Ensign (General Hospital, Ghostbusters, Titanic and Seabiscuit). There are two new songs: When the Tigers Broke Free and What Shall We Do Now? (I think When the Tigers Broke Free should have been on the album) and two songs on the album that weren't in the movie: Hey You and The Show Must Go On a scene for Hey You was filmed but not included in the movie you can watch the scene in the special features on the DVD(I think it should have been included in the movie).

    We have the rock star Pink, who spends much of the movie sitting in his apartment, unresponsively watching a television set. We see flashbacks or fantasies, of bomber-filled skies during World War Two, memories of his childhood with his overprotective mother and of the school he went to as a child, adult memories of his tuning out his wife, who leaves him for another man, a sudden "turn" where he acts violently and smashing everything in his apartment, animations involving fascism and a wall, himself as a fascist leader. He only comes to life when a bunch of people have to give him a drug injection so he can perform a concert show. The movie is based on Pink Floyd's super-hit album "The Wall", though one song is referenced that wasn't in the album. But what does the movie represent? Pink has as much character as a department store mannequin, and we don't really find out anything about him, or why he is such a passive character. Burned out on drugs, or fame? Really, the movie is a whole bunch of images (often repeated), and the whole isn't greater than the sum of its parts.

    A right-brained pity parade with pop hooks. Most people aren't going to have the patience to make sense of it; you can't really blame them, it's easier to let the images wash over you (which are pretty unpleasant). Trying to really get into this is like the scene with Pink rearranging hotel room debris in schizo patterns...would you really *want* to understand? There's definitely a method to the madness, though. Its not as incoherent as it seems. The album is like listening to a musical suicide note & the movie is like being inside a suicide's brain, every run on thought & recollection recreated in kaleidscopic detail. Along with Gerald Scarfe's delirious cartoons it's an epic montage of misery; words can't really describe it. In the end you can forgive it's miserablism, its earned & most others on the same wavelength don't have the same sheer visual inventiveness, anyway. It's possibly the greatest music video ever made. Mental disintegration is the perfect topic for this medium. THE WALL is about a depressed rock star, reviewing his life through a drugged out haze in every ugly detail.The kind of life summary someone hitting rock bottom makes. Everything is pain & darkness, fresh trauma waiting around every corner. It's the visual equivalent of Edvard Munch's Scream painting (which the movie poster riffs on). One long wail of despair, it's only interested in the hellish depths, the kind of flick you don't put on often. Negating everything is the first step to accepting everything, however. Here, the journey through Pink's subconscious is set to song. It's Roger Water's MTV therapy session & would be a total waste of time if he wasn't so masochistically honest about what a f*cked up human being he/we are. It's so harsh that it denies the truth of anything except pain, sweeping up much in its wake- mothers/lovers school fascism war - the whole convoluted system that sends people into these suicidal spirals by trying to mold them from day 1. They're not separable. It's in that spirit of total negation that someone can really bare to look closely at these things...paint it black. What stands out in this operatic fever dream? Sarcastic schoolyard anthems, masked children on conveyor belts ground to paste, cruel teachers, self mutilating rock stars laying waste to mankind, screwing flowers, towering walls, trials & talking asses, explosions, worms, dead staring eyes- Its amazing how everything gets a call-out, a big summing up. It's all here. Fatherless boys & castrating mothers, goose stepping & falling bombs...this stuff is great. Roger Waters is a d*ick but Roger Waters also has balls to be retracing his steps through the labyrinth like he does here, It's not either/or. Exposing your inner dictator isn't a walk in the park. I'm really glad for movies like this, not only does it recreate what a nervous breakdown can feel like but goes further & holistically ties it back into society with the totalitarian stuff. Pink is a microcosm. The wall itself makes me think of Wilhelm Reich's body armor idea, the muscular shielding people build to live in emotional war zones which quickly deadens them to *any* feeling. That in turn leads to things like shooting heroin, screwing groupies & committing mass murder to feel alive again (its utterly perfect how after the wall crashes only children are left, scrounging through wreckage). Critics who complained the film lacked resolution are dead wrong. It's great that someone made the connection for rock audiences between pop stardom & fascist demagoguery, too. It's done in a way where you're not sure whether to chuckle or quake. The hammer & sickle pageant that erupts into rioting while an exhilarating melody plays has to be the most jaw dropping moment I've seen in a musical. You feel guilty for getting into the tune with beatings & rapes on-screen, the racial slurs & skinned heads. Its blood curdling & absurd. Way to turn a cherished form inside out & shovel its steaming guts in the faces of the fans you hate, Roger. That's entertainment! There's worse sins than trying to shovel everything & the kitchen sink in but the album/movie wants to articulate the agony of it all so completely that it gets numbing quick, a constant bludgeon of horror & despair, the ultimate bad trip flick. It can be overwhelming if you're not prepared. The music provides the characters, the story, everything else is really just a framework for an apocalyptic day dream. I love Pink Floyd. Along with Radiohead they made the scariest rock music I've heard. I never connected much with pop until I heard these guys. THE WALL is the last album where the group was firing even close to all cylinders, half brilliant & half awful. I don't need these kind of pitch black tunes as much now but it was sure comforting when I did. Standout image: hard to choose just one but probably the flower devouring her mate. Best song: again hard but likely 'Comfortably Numb', which oughta be the rock anthem of the whole 20th century

    The album by Pink Floyd known as "The Wall" is a concept album which tells a story from beginning to end. While listening to only a few songs, it's hard to tell. But back to back it is clearly evident. This movie shows that story and features the entire album explaining the story. The main character, coincidentally, is named Pink. The story basically shows the process from when he was a child up to his adulthood how he got trapped behind a "wall" of isolation from society. Each song/part of the movie represents the "bricks" that make up that wall. Any true Pink Floyd fan has to watch. This movie merely confirms the true genius of Pink Floyd. I gave it a 9 out of 10.

    Even though I'm a large fan of Pink Floyd, and The Wall being the first album I ever listened to, I still find this movie to be overrated. Probably the main problem that plagues this film is the symbolism-it's overly pretentious. In the iconic "Another Brick in the Wall II" segment, students are filed into a maze that leads to a giant meat grinder under the supervision of their evil Scottish teacher. What exactly LEAD into this? A simple embarrassment in front of the class. And there's Geldof himself-it's alright when he doesn't talk, but his voice-and his grotesque face-just don't fit the tone of the movie. This said, it's actually pretty funny to see him scream "STO-OP!". Like I said, it's just not a faithful adaptation of the album. It CAN be done-there's concert footage planned for use in the film that suits it PERFECTLY-but here, it's just mediocre at best.

    Even the cast and crew hated this movie. WHY. I find this one of the greatest movies of all time. I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd and The Wall is my favorite album of theirs. The film follows the story of Pink who is based on Roger Waters and Syd Barrett. He decides to completely isolate himself from the world ("his wall") which he has been contemplating since his birth after his father died during Operation Shingle in Anzio during World War II (When the Tigers Broke Free, Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1 and Bring the Boys Back Home), the cruel treatment by his teachers (The Happiest Days of our Lives and Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2) and his wife's affair (One of My Turns, Don't Leave Me Now and Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3). There is almost no dialogue and is told through Pink Floyd's music. The films is directed by Alan Parker (Angel Heart, Mississippi Burning, Evita and Angela's Ashes) and stars: Bob Geldof (Spice World), Christine Hargreaves (Coronation Street, An American Werewolf in London and 1984), Eleanor David (The Scarlet Pimpernel, Comfort and Joy and 84 Charring Cross Road), Alex McAvoy (Country Dance, The Massacre of Glencoe and Strictly Sinatra), Bob Hoskins (Brazil, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Hook and Enemy at the Gates) and Michael Ensign (General Hospital, Ghostbusters, Titanic and Seabiscuit). There are two new songs: When the Tigers Broke Free and What Shall We Do Now? (I think When the Tigers Broke Free should have been on the album) and two songs on the album that weren't in the movie: Hey You and The Show Must Go On a scene for Hey You was filmed but not included in the movie you can watch the scene in the special features on the DVD(I think it should have been included in the movie). Rating 9/10 stars MPAA Rating: R for Disturbing Violent Images, Strong Sexuality and Drug Use, Nudity, Mature Thematic Elements and Brief Language

    Pink Floyd began to reach its heyday when rock-and-roll music was still viewed as "the devil's music" and was negatively received in circles outside of its core fanbase. Let it be known and heard that the band's cult film Pink Floyd: The Wall has more knowledgeable and thought-provoking things to say than anything any of those circles ever said. The film is a deafening, absolutely incomparable movie-experience and an aesthetic and narrative breakthrough for music-documentaries. The film doesn't assume the basic qualities of conventional rock-documentaries, not becoming a concert-film or profiling a band and getting down to what makes them unique and noteworthy. It destroys conventionality within the genre, assuming the qualities of startling and powerful impressionistic and expressionistic cinema simultaneously. The Wall assumes a loose narrative, following Pink (Bob Geldof), the increasingly detached narrator of the film who has wicked, often explicit hallucinations. His hallucinations feature violent depictions of war, disturbing videos of children singing harmoniously to music, and many others that I do not want to spoil. The film is only disjointed if that's how you choose to view it, meaning if you seek to find meaning and piece together its small vignettes into something larger and more universal, you'll have an effective picture in terms or thematic relevance. If you watch the film solely for the images, sound, music, and content, then you get the expressionism I spoke of earlier. Ultimately, the film's central theme - at least in my eyes - is self-destruction, from a domestic and global perspective in addition to a more personal one. Its constant images of violence, torment, and the dehumanization of children can effectively state that the film's central ideas deal with that of destruction from the inside rather than outside forces. Combined with these live-action and animated clips (brilliantly directed by Gerald Scarfe) are the songs of Floyd's enigmatic masterwork of an album The Wall, which was released in 1979. Rarely has rock music achieved heights these high. Rarely have themes such as isolation, desperation, and self-destruction been so prominent and affecting on the viewer. At ninety-five minutes long, Pink Floyd: The Wall has the impact of an epic, and works on levels from an excellent portrait of a rock album to a compelling and elusive tone-poem on the state of the America and the common man. Starring: Bob Geldof. Directed by Alan Parker and Gerald Scarfe (animated scenes only).

    I've been a fan of Pink Floyd since the seventies and in particular love The Wall album, which was based on Roger Waters feelings of boredom and alienation during massive American tours in the late seventies and has flashbacks to his brutal treatment at school in the fifties. The film, a musical with little dialogue and mostly made up of Pink Floyd tunes, sees Bob Geldof play Pink, a burned out rock star who is going insane in his hotel room. Also there are flashbacks to the fifties of how Pink, well Waters really, became a rock star by writing lyrics to what would become Pink Floyd songs during school lessons to the dismay of his teachers, who are shown up as sadistic buffoons. Later in the film Pink, high on drugs, descends into madness and smashes up his hotel room and attacks a groupie. When he is sedated and drifts into a deep sleep, Bob Hoskins has a decent cameo as his manager, Pink dreams he has become a fascist leader at a mass rally similar to a huge concert, but with the difference that the music is inciting hatred and violence. ( While you might wonder what this has to do with a left leaning figure like Waters, he was highly critical of the extreme Right and nationalism on The Wall). Finally the film ends with Pink being trapped behind a huge wall. OK non fans will hate it, as you have to have a deep understanding of Roger Waters mindset in 1979 and what inspired the film and album, but for all fans of Waters and Pink Floyd, The Wall is a must see film.

    I recently really discovered Pink Floyd's music (yeah, I know) and The Wall is one of my favorite albums from them, and when I heard it was a film I did think it would be something like what I got. It's rich in symbolism and there's a lot here that surely went over my head, but for the most part even when you're totally lost at what it's trying to tell you there's a lot to enjoy. The music taken at face-value is amazing as it is, so in that way it works, but some segments are more noticeably stronger than others. The final ten minutes are haunting and never really let you gasp for air, and in that intoxicating sense it's able to fully fledge in your memory.

    Roger Waters didn't like it. The director Alan Parker didn't like it. Animation designer Gerald Scarfe didn't like it. David Gilmour didn't like it as much as the album and the concert. So is Pink Floyd The Wall bad? No. Is it good then? Sort of. It certainly isn't great. This live-action/animated musical follows Pink, a rock star, who isolates himself from the world and slowly goes mad. The first thing you notice about the movie is that its strange narrative structure was clearly influenced by the whole surrealist movement. While this fits some parts of the whole The Wall concept perfectly, some parts are also rather messy  especially in the first act. In spite of it being fairly messy (direction wise) Pink Floyd The Wall isn't hard to follow, particularly if you're familiar with the album. It doesn't take a genius to understand the movie. Let's just take the musical aspect of the movie out of the way. The music is undoubtedly good, after all it is one of the most famous Pink Floyd albums. But if you're interested in the music, one might ask why not just listen to the album instead of watching the movie. One may also argue that the The Wall concept is pretty detailed on the album and that this story doesn't need to be told through another medium. That being said, I didn't like some songs in the movie. And by some songs I primarily mean the usage of When the Tigers Broke Free. During the segments that use this song, I couldn't shake the feeling that this song was written simply to tie the movie together. I know that it was written at the same time as The Wall, but I couldn't help to feel otherwise  the song was narrating what was happening in the movie. I found that to be sloppy and unnecessary. I don't need narrative exposition for something I can see with my own eyes. Also, the main actor Bob Geldof, who is the lead singer of The Boomtown Rats, couldn't do a satisfying Waters impression throughout his singing parts. So that's another reason to just listen to the album instead. Considering the whole movie is pretty much a 90 minute music video for the album and that everyone who listens to Pink Floyd (the movie's primary audience) is acquainted with The Wall concept, I won't spend much time analyzing the story. I'll just say I fully agree with Waters when he said that the movie doesn't let the audience sympathize with Pink. It's also very strange that the movie has so many anti war elements when the album hasn't. The Final Cut, the album which came out a year after this movie, has much more anti war propaganda than The Wall. Anyway, as I said, much of the story is being told through Pink Floyd songs. Since the movie isn't so story driven, I should mention the visuals. The animation is perfect, it's full of beautifully twisted pictures that often resemble an LSD trip. The cinematography is also stunning, mostly during the Another Brick in The Wall Pt 2 segment. Basically, the movie is worth watching based on visuals alone. And if you're a big Pink Floyd fan you'll enjoy this strange experience that is Pink Floyd The Wall even more. Rating: 7/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com

    I recall seeing The Wall at the midnight movies a few times, and I found it quite depressing. Let's face it, the movie, The Wall is a sad and depressing movie about Pink. He is basically depressed to the point of being catatonic, and he spends most of the movie just sitting with a cigarette in his hand. The rest of it is mostly in his mind. So what do I think this movie is worth a 10? If you just look at The Wall as a bunch of music videos, it is pretty good. Bob Geldof, who plays Pink, was not any great actor. He was the singer for the Boomtown Rats, and he is probably in this movie because he looks like a depressed and unhappy fellow. So we cannot really judge The Wall on the acting. It is about songs and short bits. The teacher yelling at the young Pink is a great little video that goes with the song Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2. In The Flesh has a great bit of video. So, if you really want to enjoy this movie, I suggest that you just enjoy the music, and look at it as a big music video.

    Pink Floyd began to reach its heyday when rock-and-roll music was still viewed as "the devil's music" and was negatively received in circles outside of its core fanbase. Let it be known and heard that the band's cult film Pink Floyd: The Wall has more knowledgeable and thought-provoking things to say than anything any of those circles ever said. The film is a deafening, absolutely incomparable movie-experience and an aesthetic and narrative breakthrough for music-documentaries. The film doesn't assume the basic qualities of conventional rock-documentaries, not becoming a concert-film or profiling a band and getting down to what makes them unique and noteworthy. It destroys conventionality within the genre, assuming the qualities of startling and powerful impressionistic and expressionistic cinema simultaneously. The Wall assumes a loose narrative, following Pink (Bob Geldof), the increasingly detached narrator of the film who has wicked, often explicit hallucinations. His hallucinations feature violent depictions of war, disturbing videos of children singing harmoniously to music, and many others that I do not want to spoil. The film is only disjointed if that's how you choose to view it, meaning if you seek to find meaning and piece together its small vignettes into something larger and more universal, you'll have an effective picture in terms or thematic relevance. If you watch the film solely for the images, sound, music, and content, then you get the expressionism I spoke of earlier. Ultimately, the film's central theme - at least in my eyes - is self-destruction, from a domestic and global perspective in addition to a more personal one. Its constant images of violence, torment, and the dehumanization of children can effectively state that the film's central ideas deal with that of destruction from the inside rather than outside forces. Combined with these live-action and animated clips (brilliantly directed by Gerald Scarfe) are the songs of Floyd's enigmatic masterwork of an album The Wall, which was released in 1979. Rarely has rock music achieved heights these high. Rarely have themes such as isolation, desperation, and self-destruction been so prominent and affecting on the viewer. At ninety-five minutes long, Pink Floyd: The Wall has the impact of an epic, and works on levels from an excellent portrait of a rock album to a compelling and elusive tone-poem on the state of the America and the common man. Starring: Bob Geldof. Directed by Alan Parker and Gerald Scarfe (animated scenes only).

    I've been a fan of Pink Floyd since the seventies and in particular love The Wall album, which was based on Roger Waters feelings of boredom and alienation during massive American tours in the late seventies and has flashbacks to his brutal treatment at school in the fifties. The film, a musical with little dialogue and mostly made up of Pink Floyd tunes, sees Bob Geldof play Pink, a burned out rock star who is going insane in his hotel room. Also there are flashbacks to the fifties of how Pink, well Waters really, became a rock star by writing lyrics to what would become Pink Floyd songs during school lessons to the dismay of his teachers, who are shown up as sadistic buffoons. Later in the film Pink, high on drugs, descends into madness and smashes up his hotel room and attacks a groupie. When he is sedated and drifts into a deep sleep, Bob Hoskins has a decent cameo as his manager, Pink dreams he has become a fascist leader at a mass rally similar to a huge concert, but with the difference that the music is inciting hatred and violence. ( While you might wonder what this has to do with a left leaning figure like Waters, he was highly critical of the extreme Right and nationalism on The Wall). Finally the film ends with Pink being trapped behind a huge wall. OK non fans will hate it, as you have to have a deep understanding of Roger Waters mindset in 1979 and what inspired the film and album, but for all fans of Waters and Pink Floyd, The Wall is a must see film.

    I recently really discovered Pink Floyd's music (yeah, I know) and The Wall is one of my favorite albums from them, and when I heard it was a film I did think it would be something like what I got. It's rich in symbolism and there's a lot here that surely went over my head, but for the most part even when you're totally lost at what it's trying to tell you there's a lot to enjoy. The music taken at face-value is amazing as it is, so in that way it works, but some segments are more noticeably stronger than others. The final ten minutes are haunting and never really let you gasp for air, and in that intoxicating sense it's able to fully fledge in your memory.

    Roger Waters didn't like it. The director Alan Parker didn't like it. Animation designer Gerald Scarfe didn't like it. David Gilmour didn't like it as much as the album and the concert. So is Pink Floyd The Wall bad? No. Is it good then? Sort of. It certainly isn't great. This live-action/animated musical follows Pink, a rock star, who isolates himself from the world and slowly goes mad. The first thing you notice about the movie is that its strange narrative structure was clearly influenced by the whole surrealist movement. While this fits some parts of the whole The Wall concept perfectly, some parts are also rather messy  especially in the first act. In spite of it being fairly messy (direction wise) Pink Floyd The Wall isn't hard to follow, particularly if you're familiar with the album. It doesn't take a genius to understand the movie. Let's just take the musical aspect of the movie out of the way. The music is undoubtedly good, after all it is one of the most famous Pink Floyd albums. But if you're interested in the music, one might ask why not just listen to the album instead of watching the movie. One may also argue that the The Wall concept is pretty detailed on the album and that this story doesn't need to be told through another medium. That being said, I didn't like some songs in the movie. And by some songs I primarily mean the usage of When the Tigers Broke Free. During the segments that use this song, I couldn't shake the feeling that this song was written simply to tie the movie together. I know that it was written at the same time as The Wall, but I couldn't help to feel otherwise  the song was narrating what was happening in the movie. I found that to be sloppy and unnecessary. I don't need narrative exposition for something I can see with my own eyes. Also, the main actor Bob Geldof, who is the lead singer of The Boomtown Rats, couldn't do a satisfying Waters impression throughout his singing parts. So that's another reason to just listen to the album instead. Considering the whole movie is pretty much a 90 minute music video for the album and that everyone who listens to Pink Floyd (the movie's primary audience) is acquainted with The Wall concept, I won't spend much time analyzing the story. I'll just say I fully agree with Waters when he said that the movie doesn't let the audience sympathize with Pink. It's also very strange that the movie has so many anti war elements when the album hasn't. The Final Cut, the album which came out a year after this movie, has much more anti war propaganda than The Wall. Anyway, as I said, much of the story is being told through Pink Floyd songs. Since the movie isn't so story driven, I should mention the visuals. The animation is perfect, it's full of beautifully twisted pictures that often resemble an LSD trip. The cinematography is also stunning, mostly during the Another Brick in The Wall Pt 2 segment. Basically, the movie is worth watching based on visuals alone. And if you're a big Pink Floyd fan you'll enjoy this strange experience that is Pink Floyd The Wall even more. Rating: 7/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com

    I recall seeing The Wall at the midnight movies a few times, and I found it quite depressing. Let's face it, the movie, The Wall is a sad and depressing movie about Pink. He is basically depressed to the point of being catatonic, and he spends most of the movie just sitting with a cigarette in his hand. The rest of it is mostly in his mind. So what do I think this movie is worth a 10? If you just look at The Wall as a bunch of music videos, it is pretty good. Bob Geldof, who plays Pink, was not any great actor. He was the singer for the Boomtown Rats, and he is probably in this movie because he looks like a depressed and unhappy fellow. So we cannot really judge The Wall on the acting. It is about songs and short bits. The teacher yelling at the young Pink is a great little video that goes with the song Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2. In The Flesh has a great bit of video. So, if you really want to enjoy this movie, I suggest that you just enjoy the music, and look at it as a big music video.

    We have the rock star Pink, who spends much of the movie sitting in his apartment, unresponsively watching a television set. We see flashbacks or fantasies, of bomber-filled skies during World War Two, memories of his childhood with his overprotective mother and of the school he went to as a child, adult memories of his tuning out his wife, who leaves him for another man, a sudden "turn" where he acts violently and smashing everything in his apartment, animations involving fascism and a wall, himself as a fascist leader. He only comes to life when a bunch of people have to give him a drug injection so he can perform a concert show. The movie is based on Pink Floyd's super-hit album "The Wall", though one song is referenced that wasn't in the album. But what does the movie represent? Pink has as much character as a department store mannequin, and we don't really find out anything about him, or why he is such a passive character. Burned out on drugs, or fame? Really, the movie is a whole bunch of images (often repeated), and the whole isn't greater than the sum of its parts.

    A right-brained pity parade with pop hooks. Most people aren't going to have the patience to make sense of it; you can't really blame them, it's easier to let the images wash over you (which are pretty unpleasant). Trying to really get into this is like the scene with Pink rearranging hotel room debris in schizo patterns...would you really *want* to understand? There's definitely a method to the madness, though. Its not as incoherent as it seems. The album is like listening to a musical suicide note & the movie is like being inside a suicide's brain, every run on thought & recollection recreated in kaleidscopic detail. Along with Gerald Scarfe's delirious cartoons it's an epic montage of misery; words can't really describe it. In the end you can forgive it's miserablism, its earned & most others on the same wavelength don't have the same sheer visual inventiveness, anyway. It's possibly the greatest music video ever made. Mental disintegration is the perfect topic for this medium. THE WALL is about a depressed rock star, reviewing his life through a drugged out haze in every ugly detail.The kind of life summary someone hitting rock bottom makes. Everything is pain & darkness, fresh trauma waiting around every corner. It's the visual equivalent of Edvard Munch's Scream painting (which the movie poster riffs on). One long wail of despair, it's only interested in the hellish depths, the kind of flick you don't put on often. Negating everything is the first step to accepting everything, however. Here, the journey through Pink's subconscious is set to song. It's Roger Water's MTV therapy session & would be a total waste of time if he wasn't so masochistically honest about what a f*cked up human being he/we are. It's so harsh that it denies the truth of anything except pain, sweeping up much in its wake- mothers/lovers school fascism war - the whole convoluted system that sends people into these suicidal spirals by trying to mold them from day 1. They're not separable. It's in that spirit of total negation that someone can really bare to look closely at these things...paint it black. What stands out in this operatic fever dream? Sarcastic schoolyard anthems, masked children on conveyor belts ground to paste, cruel teachers, self mutilating rock stars laying waste to mankind, screwing flowers, towering walls, trials & talking asses, explosions, worms, dead staring eyes- Its amazing how everything gets a call-out, a big summing up. It's all here. Fatherless boys & castrating mothers, goose stepping & falling bombs...this stuff is great. Roger Waters is a d*ick but Roger Waters also has balls to be retracing his steps through the labyrinth like he does here, It's not either/or. Exposing your inner dictator isn't a walk in the park. I'm really glad for movies like this, not only does it recreate what a nervous breakdown can feel like but goes further & holistically ties it back into society with the totalitarian stuff. Pink is a microcosm. The wall itself makes me think of Wilhelm Reich's body armor idea, the muscular shielding people build to live in emotional war zones which quickly deadens them to *any* feeling. That in turn leads to things like shooting heroin, screwing groupies & committing mass murder to feel alive again (its utterly perfect how after the wall crashes only children are left, scrounging through wreckage). Critics who complained the film lacked resolution are dead wrong. It's great that someone made the connection for rock audiences between pop stardom & fascist demagoguery, too. It's done in a way where you're not sure whether to chuckle or quake. The hammer & sickle pageant that erupts into rioting while an exhilarating melody plays has to be the most jaw dropping moment I've seen in a musical. You feel guilty for getting into the tune with beatings & rapes on-screen, the racial slurs & skinned heads. Its blood curdling & absurd. Way to turn a cherished form inside out & shovel its steaming guts in the faces of the fans you hate, Roger. That's entertainment! There's worse sins than trying to shovel everything & the kitchen sink in but the album/movie wants to articulate the agony of it all so completely that it gets numbing quick, a constant bludgeon of horror & despair, the ultimate bad trip flick. It can be overwhelming if you're not prepared. The music provides the characters, the story, everything else is really just a framework for an apocalyptic day dream. I love Pink Floyd. Along with Radiohead they made the scariest rock music I've heard. I never connected much with pop until I heard these guys. THE WALL is the last album where the group was firing even close to all cylinders, half brilliant & half awful. I don't need these kind of pitch black tunes as much now but it was sure comforting when I did. Standout image: hard to choose just one but probably the flower devouring her mate. Best song: again hard but likely 'Comfortably Numb', which oughta be the rock anthem of the whole 20th century

    The album by Pink Floyd known as "The Wall" is a concept album which tells a story from beginning to end. While listening to only a few songs, it's hard to tell. But back to back it is clearly evident. This movie shows that story and features the entire album explaining the story. The main character, coincidentally, is named Pink. The story basically shows the process from when he was a child up to his adulthood how he got trapped behind a "wall" of isolation from society. Each song/part of the movie represents the "bricks" that make up that wall. Any true Pink Floyd fan has to watch. This movie merely confirms the true genius of Pink Floyd. I gave it a 9 out of 10.

    Even though I'm a large fan of Pink Floyd, and The Wall being the first album I ever listened to, I still find this movie to be overrated. Probably the main problem that plagues this film is the symbolism-it's overly pretentious. In the iconic "Another Brick in the Wall II" segment, students are filed into a maze that leads to a giant meat grinder under the supervision of their evil Scottish teacher. What exactly LEAD into this? A simple embarrassment in front of the class. And there's Geldof himself-it's alright when he doesn't talk, but his voice-and his grotesque face-just don't fit the tone of the movie. This said, it's actually pretty funny to see him scream "STO-OP!". Like I said, it's just not a faithful adaptation of the album. It CAN be done-there's concert footage planned for use in the film that suits it PERFECTLY-but here, it's just mediocre at best.

    Even the cast and crew hated this movie. WHY. I find this one of the greatest movies of all time. I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd and The Wall is my favorite album of theirs. The film follows the story of Pink who is based on Roger Waters and Syd Barrett. He decides to completely isolate himself from the world ("his wall") which he has been contemplating since his birth after his father died during Operation Shingle in Anzio during World War II (When the Tigers Broke Free, Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1 and Bring the Boys Back Home), the cruel treatment by his teachers (The Happiest Days of our Lives and Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2) and his wife's affair (One of My Turns, Don't Leave Me Now and Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3). There is almost no dialogue and is told through Pink Floyd's music. The films is directed by Alan Parker (Angel Heart, Mississippi Burning, Evita and Angela's Ashes) and stars: Bob Geldof (Spice World), Christine Hargreaves (Coronation Street, An American Werewolf in London and 1984), Eleanor David (The Scarlet Pimpernel, Comfort and Joy and 84 Charring Cross Road), Alex McAvoy (Country Dance, The Massacre of Glencoe and Strictly Sinatra), Bob Hoskins (Brazil, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Hook and Enemy at the Gates) and Michael Ensign (General Hospital, Ghostbusters, Titanic and Seabiscuit). There are two new songs: When the Tigers Broke Free and What Shall We Do Now? (I think When the Tigers Broke Free should have been on the album) and two songs on the album that weren't in the movie: Hey You and The Show Must Go On a scene for Hey You was filmed but not included in the movie you can watch the scene in the special features on the DVD(I think it should have been included in the movie). Rating 9/10 stars MPAA Rating: R for Disturbing Violent Images, Strong Sexuality and Drug Use, Nudity, Mature Thematic Elements and Brief Language
