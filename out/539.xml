    What were all of these people watching? It obviously wasn't the same film called Mousehunt that I was as the one that I saw was about as funny as seeing someone you love get clubbed to death in front of your eyes while he or she is in the same room as you and is no more than a yard away when it happens! I take that back. Seeing someone you love get clubbed to death in front of your eyes while he or she is in the same room as you and is no more than a yard away when it happens would actually be a whole lot funnier! All those that say this is Laurel and Hardy meets Tom and Jerry are paying a GIGTANIC disservice to Laurel and Hardy and Tom and Jerry! It is nothing like either of them as everything they are in is exceptionally worth viewing, this is not! AVOID! I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS BORING, DREARY, DULL, HORRIBLE ONE AND A HALF HOURS OF CRAP NOUGHT (ZERO TO ANYONE WHO IS NOT English/British) STARS BUT UNFORTUNITELY I CAN'T!

    Lee Evans and Nathan Lane make a great duo in this touching, yet hilarious children's movie. The chemistry between Lane and Evans is great, and the performances are very physical. Almost serving as a throwback to the rather slapstick silent era of comedy cinema. The mouse is a devious, yet benevolent character, and the audience is made to feel sympathy for it; being portrayed as somewhat of a lonely soul with anthropomorphic qualities. Lars and Ernie are similarly sympathetically portrayed, with many lessons about keeping family together occasionally scattered throughout the film. Crucially though, the movie isn't too mawkish about it. Mousehunt is lighthearted enough to carry the meagerly tragic undertones present in the film, and there are a lot of laughs. I enjoyed this movie a lot as a 6 year old watching it for the first time, and I can say that I still enjoy it to this day. It's definitely a film I'd recommend to anyone who are struggling to decide what to sit their young children in front of on a Christmas evening.

    When their father dies, Ernie & Lars inherit an old house and the family string factory. Lars, the loyal son, refuses to sell the factory, which angers his wife so she kicks him out. Ernie, who runs a restaurant, is suddenly left with nothing when the mayor dies while eating there. With no other place to go, the brothers shack up at the old house, and then finding out the place is worth a fortune. They decide to fix up the place and sell it in an auction, but first, they have to get rid of a mouse living in the walls....... Proving that Gore Verbinski started out as a great director, and around 2002 sold himself to Disney, mouse hunt is a family film with a hideous dark side. Think the film as a hybrid between Home Alone and The People under the stairs, and it for the most part it works, but the supporting characters really spoil the broth. Walken and Hickey are brilliant, but they are just cameos, and apart from Jeter, all the other supporting characters are walking tropes. The money hungry wife, the rich fat buyers, and the stereotypical gangsters, just make the film feel less unique. Evans and Lane make a good pairing and their physical comedy usurps anything Harry and Marv got up to. The CGI looks a little bit ropes now, especially Catzilla, but it really adds to the silliness of it all. Its highly predictable stuff, you know the house will get destroyed, and you know that all will well come the end. Worth seeing, but don't expect anything groundbreaking.

    Two brothers Ernie (Nathan Lane) and Lars (Lee Evans) inherit a museum- like thread factory and a debt-ridden mansion after the demise of their father. They soon discover that the mansion was designed by the infamous Charles Lyle La Rue, and actually worth millions of dollar. Eager to furnish and sell it, they forgot about the other "caretaker" of the house, a cute, cunning unnamed Mouse. Things got wacky when the brothers start to get rid of the mouse, using one method after another. This film was like 15 years ago but its humor is still fresh. It's one of those comedy-films where you'd laugh at the same scenes, over and over again. The first family-film by Dream Works, I dare say it's a classic. Jokes and laughter aside, Mouse-hunt teaches audience the family value, the quality of life andÂ… how to catch a Mouse. One should ponder deeply what Mr. Rudolf's saying - "A world without string is chaos" really means. Verdict: Watch and laugh.

    I saw this movie as a child and the dark humor was awful for any kid. yes, a agree with the not parts were good. the thing that most got me was SHOWING THE CAT PUT TO SLEEP! I mean WTF why did they have to show that. that dis not fit the whole family friendly idea they were going for. Man that made me some mad as a kid. I know it happens but its not humor. This reminds me of sucker-punch and the whole ideal of lobotomy as good idea for entertainment.i mean what were they thinking in both films? where they like oh, that's fine leave it in it makes great since. The killing the cat or animal in many films makes me sick. If the animal has rabies then i can understand unless there is a cure. I hate the scene in The Boondock Saints were they shoot the cat an were like oh, crap. I mean that had not meaning or story development at all so why did they leave it in? Its not go humor and its just bad taste.

    I expected very little given the premise and the fact that Lee Evans was in it. "he is a one-trick pony" I thought, but he is great in this and partnered perfectly with Nathan Lane, a comic actor I just love. It is much darker than one would imagine and that is a very good thing. It has something for all senses of humour and the set pieces are superbly timed and executed. It actually improves with repeated viewing and that is untrue of many comedies. Lane and Evans should make more movies together , they work well off each other. I had not realised that Verbinski had directed Pirates movies and that this was his debut - it is a terrific first outing.

    Reasonable, mostly silly slapstick from Gore Verbinski concerning two misfit brothers who inherit a mansion of great worth, only to lose it to a mouse. Good, fun flick with some true comic moments, is headed for an obvious conclusion early on, even though it takes some time to warm up. Nathan Lane and Lee Evans are no match for our hero, the mouse. The support cast do a reasonable job, and although Christopher Walken wastes his enormous talent here, his presence always brings a smile to my face. Saturday, June 26, 1999 - Video

    Mousehunt was a very energetic, fun and highly inventive comedy. I just worry however that some of the darker moments might scare younger children and maybe not for those with a phobia of rodents and also one or two of the gags are a tad too obvious. However, it is a very entertaining family film. The plot tells of two brothers who inherits a large house only to find it is already occupied by a pesky mouse. The script is often hilarious, and there is plenty of Laurel and Hardy-like visual flair to suffice the entertainment value. There are some nice sets and costumes. And the performances are great. While I am not that fond of Lee Evans, both he and Nathan Lane give stellar performances as the hapless brothers, and you can see clever nods to Laurel and Hardy. Then there is Christopher Walken's hilarious turn as the exterminator, but of course it is the mouse who steals the show. Very cute, intelligent and funny for a rodent. All in all, great film. Maybe not for everyone, but essentially it is lots of fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    For 12 years, I have loved this movie, but it's been a long since I watched it, so last night I finally found it, and relived some fond memories. This is a very funny movie about two brothers named Ernie and Lars Smuntz who are down on their luck. Their father died, and receive the deed to an old mansion with a bank debt. They find out that a very famous architect named Charles Lyle LaRue built the house in 1876. The brothers figure it's worth a fortune and hold an auction the following week. During this time, they deal with an incredibly smart mouse who gives them nothing but trouble. They try setting traps, buy a deranged cat named Catzilla, and even hire an expert named Caeser, but the mouse is too smart for all that. Will they ever get rid of this cute little rodent before the auction? I highly recommend MOUSE HUNT!!!

    This is Hollywood at it's rarest. It is hard to grasp the exact age group intended for the audience. It's basically a dark comedy about two brothers in the 50s who inherit a mansion of a house. They try to clean it up and save it to sell and make money. Everything that could go wrong happens. The main storyline is the cat and mouse game that the two brothers play with the mouse in the house. Nothing but pure slapstick comedy. If you're one for physical and crude jokes, this one is for you. The level of insanity in the movie goes out the roof. Just about every time I watch it, I have a hard time not to even cry it is that funny. This is one that will more than likely stir just a few cackles out of the older folks, definitely original.

    Two brothers Ernie (Nathan Lane) and Lars (Lee Evans) inherit a museum- like thread factory and a debt-ridden mansion after the demise of their father. They soon discover that the mansion was designed by the infamous Charles Lyle La Rue, and actually worth millions of dollar. Eager to furnish and sell it, they forgot about the other "caretaker" of the house, a cute, cunning unnamed Mouse. Things got wacky when the brothers start to get rid of the mouse, using one method after another. This film was like 15 years ago but its humor is still fresh. It's one of those comedy-films where you'd laugh at the same scenes, over and over again. The first family-film by Dream Works, I dare say it's a classic. Jokes and laughter aside, Mouse-hunt teaches audience the family value, the quality of life andÂ… how to catch a Mouse.

It is much darker than one would imagine and that is a very good thing. It has something for all senses of humour and the set pieces are superbly timed and executed. It actually improves with repeated viewing and that is untrue of many comedies. Lane and Evans should make more movies together , they work well off each other.

    Reasonable, mostly silly slapstick from Gore Verbinski concerning two misfit brothers who inherit a mansion of great worth, only to lose it to a mouse.

    Mousehunt was a very energetic, fun and highly inventive comedy. I just worry however that some of the darker moments might scare younger children and maybe not for those with a phobia of rodents and also one or two of the gags are a tad too obvious. However, it is a very entertaining family film. The plot tells of two brothers who inherits a large house only to find it is already occupied by a pesky mouse. The script is often hilarious, and there is plenty of Laurel and Hardy-like visual flair to suffice the entertainment value. There are some nice sets and costumes. And the performances are great. While I am not that fond of Lee Evans, both he and Nathan Lane give stellar performances as the hapless brothers, and you can see clever nods to Laurel and Hardy. Then there is Christopher Walken's hilarious turn as the exterminator, but of course it is the mouse who steals the show. Very cute, intelligent and funny for a rodent. All in all, great film.

    For 12 years, I have loved this movie, but it's been a long since I watched it, so last night I finally found it, and relived some fond memories. This is a very funny movie about two brothers named Ernie and Lars Smuntz who are down on their luck. Their father died, and receive the deed to an old mansion with a bank debt. They find out that a very famous architect named Charles Lyle LaRue built the house in 1876. The brothers figure it's worth a fortune and hold an auction the following week. During this time, they deal with an incredibly smart mouse who gives them nothing but trouble. They try setting traps, buy a deranged cat named Catzilla, and even hire an expert named Caeser, but the mouse is too smart for all that. Will they ever get rid of this cute little rodent before the auction? I highly recommend MOUSE HUNT!!!

    This is Hollywood at it's rarest. It is hard to grasp the exact age group intended for the audience. It's basically a dark comedy about two brothers in the 50s who inherit a mansion of a house. They try to clean it up and save it to sell and make money. Everything that could go wrong happens. The main storyline is the cat and mouse game that the two brothers play with the mouse in the house. Nothing but pure slapstick comedy. If you're one for physical and crude jokes, this one is for you. The level of insanity in the movie goes out the roof. Just about every time I watch it, I have a hard time not to even cry it is that funny. This is one that will more than likely stir just a few cackles out of the older folks, definitely original.

    What were all of these people watching? It obviously wasn't the same film called Mousehunt that I was as the one that I saw was about as funny as seeing someone you love get clubbed to death in front of your eyes while he or she is in the same room as you and is no more than a yard away when it happens! I take that back. Seeing someone you love get clubbed to death in front of your eyes while he or she is in the same room as you and is no more than a yard away when it happens would actually be a whole lot funnier! All those that say this is Laurel and Hardy meets Tom and Jerry are paying a GIGTANIC disservice to Laurel and Hardy and Tom and Jerry! It is nothing like either of them as everything they are in is exceptionally worth viewing, this is not! AVOID! I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS BORING, DREARY, DULL, HORRIBLE ONE AND A HALF HOURS OF CRAP NOUGHT (ZERO TO ANYONE WHO IS NOT English/British) STARS BUT UNFORTUNITELY I CAN'T!

    Lee Evans and Nathan Lane make a great duo in this touching, yet hilarious children's movie. The chemistry between Lane and Evans is great, and the performances are very physical. Almost serving as a throwback to the rather slapstick silent era of comedy cinema. The mouse is a devious, yet benevolent character, and the audience is made to feel sympathy for it; being portrayed as somewhat of a lonely soul with anthropomorphic qualities. Lars and Ernie are similarly sympathetically portrayed, with many lessons about keeping family together occasionally scattered throughout the film. Crucially though, the movie isn't too mawkish about it. Mousehunt is lighthearted enough to carry the meagerly tragic undertones present in the film, and there are a lot of laughs. I enjoyed this movie a lot as a 6 year old watching it for the first time, and I can say that I still enjoy it to this day. It's definitely a film I'd recommend to anyone who are struggling to decide what to sit their young children in front of on a Christmas evening.

    When their father dies, Ernie & Lars inherit an old house and the family string factory. Lars, the loyal son, refuses to sell the factory, which angers his wife so she kicks him out. Ernie, who runs a restaurant, is suddenly left with nothing when the mayor dies while eating there. With no other place to go, the brothers shack up at the old house, and then finding out the place is worth a fortune. They decide to fix up the place and sell it in an auction, but first, they have to get rid of a mouse living in the walls....... Proving that Gore Verbinski started out as a great director, and around 2002 sold himself to Disney, mouse hunt is a family film with a hideous dark side. Think the film as a hybrid between Home Alone and The People under the stairs, and it for the most part it works, but the supporting characters really spoil the broth. Walken and Hickey are brilliant, but they are just cameos, and apart from Jeter, all the other supporting characters are walking tropes. The money hungry wife, the rich fat buyers, and the stereotypical gangsters, just make the film feel less unique. Evans and Lane make a good pairing and their physical comedy usurps anything Harry and Marv got up to. The CGI looks a little bit ropes now, especially Catzilla, but it really adds to the silliness of it all. Its highly predictable stuff, you know the house will get destroyed, and you know that all will well come the end. Worth seeing, but don't expect anything groundbreaking.

    This is Hollywood at it's rarest. It is hard to grasp the exact age group intended for the audience. It's basically a dark comedy about two brothers in the 50s who inherit a mansion of a house. They try to clean it up and save it to sell and make money. Everything that could go wrong happens. The main storyline is the cat and mouse game that the two brothers play with the mouse in the house. Nothing but pure slapstick comedy. If you're one for physical and crude jokes, this one is for you. The level of insanity in the movie goes out the roof. Just about every time I watch it, I have a hard time not to even cry it is that funny. This is one that will more than likely stir just a few cackles out of the older folks, definitely original.

    What were all of these people watching? It obviously wasn't the same film called Mousehunt that I was as the one that I saw was about as funny as seeing someone you love get clubbed to death in front of your eyes while he or she is in the same room as you and is no more than a yard away when it happens! I take that back. Seeing someone you love get clubbed to death in front of your eyes while he or she is in the same room as you and is no more than a yard away when it happens would actually be a whole lot funnier! All those that say this is Laurel and Hardy meets Tom and Jerry are paying a GIGTANIC disservice to Laurel and Hardy and Tom and Jerry! It is nothing like either of them as everything they are in is exceptionally worth viewing, this is not! AVOID! I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS BORING, DREARY, DULL, HORRIBLE ONE AND A HALF HOURS OF CRAP NOUGHT (ZERO TO ANYONE WHO IS NOT English/British) STARS BUT UNFORTUNITELY I CAN'T!

    Lee Evans and Nathan Lane make a great duo in this touching, yet hilarious children's movie. The chemistry between Lane and Evans is great, and the performances are very physical. Almost serving as a throwback to the rather slapstick silent era of comedy cinema. The mouse is a devious, yet benevolent character, and the audience is made to feel sympathy for it; being portrayed as somewhat of a lonely soul with anthropomorphic qualities. Lars and Ernie are similarly sympathetically portrayed, with many lessons about keeping family together occasionally scattered throughout the film. Crucially though, the movie isn't too mawkish about it. Mousehunt is lighthearted enough to carry the meagerly tragic undertones present in the film, and there are a lot of laughs. I enjoyed this movie a lot as a 6 year old watching it for the first time, and I can say that I still enjoy it to this day. It's definitely a film I'd recommend to anyone who are struggling to decide what to sit their young children in front of on a Christmas evening.

    When their father dies, Ernie & Lars inherit an old house and the family string factory. Lars, the loyal son, refuses to sell the factory, which angers his wife so she kicks him out. Ernie, who runs a restaurant, is suddenly left with nothing when the mayor dies while eating there. With no other place to go, the brothers shack up at the old house, and then finding out the place is worth a fortune. They decide to fix up the place and sell it in an auction, but first, they have to get rid of a mouse living in the walls....... Proving that Gore Verbinski started out as a great director, and around 2002 sold himself to Disney, mouse hunt is a family film with a hideous dark side. Think the film as a hybrid between Home Alone and The People under the stairs, and it for the most part it works, but the supporting characters really spoil the broth. Walken and Hickey are brilliant, but they are just cameos, and apart from Jeter, all the other supporting characters are walking tropes. The money hungry wife, the rich fat buyers, and the stereotypical gangsters, just make the film feel less unique. Evans and Lane make a good pairing and their physical comedy usurps anything Harry and Marv got up to. The CGI looks a little bit ropes now, especially Catzilla, but it really adds to the silliness of it all. Its highly predictable stuff, you know the house will get destroyed, and you know that all will well come the end. Worth seeing, but don't expect anything groundbreaking.

    I saw this movie as a child and the dark humor was awful for any kid. yes, a agree with the not parts were good. the thing that most got me was SHOWING THE CAT PUT TO SLEEP! I mean WTF why did they have to show that. that dis not fit the whole family friendly idea they were going for. Man that made me some mad as a kid. I know it happens but its not humor. This reminds me of sucker-punch and the whole ideal of lobotomy as good idea for entertainment.i mean what were they thinking in both films? where they like oh, that's fine leave it in it makes great since. The killing the cat or animal in many films makes me sick. If the animal has rabies then i can understand unless there is a cure. I hate the scene in The Boondock Saints were they shoot the cat an were like oh, crap. I mean that had not meaning or story development at all so why did they leave it in? Its not go humor and its just bad taste.

    I expected very little given the premise and the fact that Lee Evans was in it. "he is a one-trick pony" I thought, but he is great in this and partnered perfectly with Nathan Lane, a comic actor I just love. It is much darker than one would imagine and that is a very good thing. It has something for all senses of humour and the set pieces are superbly timed and executed. It actually improves with repeated viewing and that is untrue of many comedies. Lane and Evans should make more movies together , they work well off each other. I had not realised that Verbinski had directed Pirates movies and that this was his debut - it is a terrific first outing.

    Reasonable, mostly silly slapstick from Gore Verbinski concerning two misfit brothers who inherit a mansion of great worth, only to lose it to a mouse. Good, fun flick with some true comic moments, is headed for an obvious conclusion early on, even though it takes some time to warm up. Nathan Lane and Lee Evans are no match for our hero, the mouse. The support cast do a reasonable job, and although Christopher Walken wastes his enormous talent here, his presence always brings a smile to my face. Saturday, June 26, 1999 - Video

    Mousehunt was a very energetic, fun and highly inventive comedy. I just worry however that some of the darker moments might scare younger children and maybe not for those with a phobia of rodents and also one or two of the gags are a tad too obvious. However, it is a very entertaining family film. The plot tells of two brothers who inherits a large house only to find it is already occupied by a pesky mouse. The script is often hilarious, and there is plenty of Laurel and Hardy-like visual flair to suffice the entertainment value. There are some nice sets and costumes. And the performances are great. While I am not that fond of Lee Evans, both he and Nathan Lane give stellar performances as the hapless brothers, and you can see clever nods to Laurel and Hardy. Then there is Christopher Walken's hilarious turn as the exterminator, but of course it is the mouse who steals the show. Very cute, intelligent and funny for a rodent. All in all, great film. Maybe not for everyone, but essentially it is lots of fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    For 12 years, I have loved this movie, but it's been a long since I watched it, so last night I finally found it, and relived some fond memories. This is a very funny movie about two brothers named Ernie and Lars Smuntz who are down on their luck. Their father died, and receive the deed to an old mansion with a bank debt. They find out that a very famous architect named Charles Lyle LaRue built the house in 1876. The brothers figure it's worth a fortune and hold an auction the following week. During this time, they deal with an incredibly smart mouse who gives them nothing but trouble. They try setting traps, buy a deranged cat named Catzilla, and even hire an expert named Caeser, but the mouse is too smart for all that. Will they ever get rid of this cute little rodent before the auction? I highly recommend MOUSE HUNT!!!

    I saw this movie as a child and the dark humor was awful for any kid. yes, a agree with the not parts were good. the thing that most got me was SHOWING THE CAT PUT TO SLEEP! I mean WTF why did they have to show that. that dis not fit the whole family friendly idea they were going for. Man that made me some mad as a kid. I know it happens but its not humor. This reminds me of sucker-punch and the whole ideal of lobotomy as good idea for entertainment.i mean what were they thinking in both films? where they like oh, that's fine leave it in it makes great since. The killing the cat or animal in many films makes me sick. If the animal has rabies then i can understand unless there is a cure. I hate the scene in The Boondock Saints were they shoot the cat an were like oh, crap. I mean that had not meaning or story development at all so why did they leave it in? Its not go humor and its just bad taste.

    I expected very little given the premise and the fact that Lee Evans was in it. "he is a one-trick pony" I thought, but he is great in this and partnered perfectly with Nathan Lane, a comic actor I just love. It is much darker than one would imagine and that is a very good thing. It has something for all senses of humour and the set pieces are superbly timed and executed. It actually improves with repeated viewing and that is untrue of many comedies. Lane and Evans should make more movies together , they work well off each other. I had not realised that Verbinski had directed Pirates movies and that this was his debut - it is a terrific first outing.

    Reasonable, mostly silly slapstick from Gore Verbinski concerning two misfit brothers who inherit a mansion of great worth, only to lose it to a mouse. Good, fun flick with some true comic moments, is headed for an obvious conclusion early on, even though it takes some time to warm up. Nathan Lane and Lee Evans are no match for our hero, the mouse. The support cast do a reasonable job, and although Christopher Walken wastes his enormous talent here, his presence always brings a smile to my face. Saturday, June 26, 1999 - Video

    Mousehunt was a very energetic, fun and highly inventive comedy. I just worry however that some of the darker moments might scare younger children and maybe not for those with a phobia of rodents and also one or two of the gags are a tad too obvious. However, it is a very entertaining family film. The plot tells of two brothers who inherits a large house only to find it is already occupied by a pesky mouse. The script is often hilarious, and there is plenty of Laurel and Hardy-like visual flair to suffice the entertainment value. There are some nice sets and costumes. And the performances are great. While I am not that fond of Lee Evans, both he and Nathan Lane give stellar performances as the hapless brothers, and you can see clever nods to Laurel and Hardy. Then there is Christopher Walken's hilarious turn as the exterminator, but of course it is the mouse who steals the show. Very cute, intelligent and funny for a rodent. All in all, great film. Maybe not for everyone, but essentially it is lots of fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    For 12 years, I have loved this movie, but it's been a long since I watched it, so last night I finally found it, and relived some fond memories. This is a very funny movie about two brothers named Ernie and Lars Smuntz who are down on their luck. Their father died, and receive the deed to an old mansion with a bank debt. They find out that a very famous architect named Charles Lyle LaRue built the house in 1876. The brothers figure it's worth a fortune and hold an auction the following week. During this time, they deal with an incredibly smart mouse who gives them nothing but trouble. They try setting traps, buy a deranged cat named Catzilla, and even hire an expert named Caeser, but the mouse is too smart for all that. Will they ever get rid of this cute little rodent before the auction? I highly recommend MOUSE HUNT!!!

    This is Hollywood at it's rarest. It is hard to grasp the exact age group intended for the audience. It's basically a dark comedy about two brothers in the 50s who inherit a mansion of a house. They try to clean it up and save it to sell and make money. Everything that could go wrong happens. The main storyline is the cat and mouse game that the two brothers play with the mouse in the house. Nothing but pure slapstick comedy. If you're one for physical and crude jokes, this one is for you. The level of insanity in the movie goes out the roof. Just about every time I watch it, I have a hard time not to even cry it is that funny. This is one that will more than likely stir just a few cackles out of the older folks, definitely original.
