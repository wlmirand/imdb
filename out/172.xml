    After the huge success of "Star Wars" both critical and in the box office, giving birth to a new era cinema. George Lucas was already planning its sequel, but decided to divide his work with the director Irvin Kershner and screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, many fans were afraid (even with Lucas writing the story), but this group brought the saga to a all-new and unexplored level. "Empire" begins shortly after the huge events of its predecessor with the entire rebel army after destroying the " Death Star", fleeing through galaxy with the powerful imperial fleet right behind them with ruthless Darth Vader (David Prowse) in command. And with the rebels we see Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) finally realizing his dream of becoming a pilot in the rebel army against the empire, and alongside him his "inseparable" friends: the brave and cocky (and Badass) Han Solo (Harrison Ford); the brave and intelligent Leia (Carrie Fisher); the.....Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew); R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). But their lives begin to suffer a great risk when the Empire finds the rebel position in the ice world of Hoth, where a huge battle starts forcing the rebels to retreat. Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C - 3PO manage to escape in the Millennium Falcon, but end up being captured later by Darth Vader thanks to a betrayal of Han's friend, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Luke and R2 were able to escape as well, but with the voice instruction from Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), Luke is advised to go to the Dagobah system and meet the Jedi master Yoda (Frank Oz) which will help Luke know and control the "strength", which later will bring him sinister secrets and the sacrifice for his friends. At the time it came-out, the film was poorly received by critics and fans, but perhaps understandable. No one at the time expected to see a major change in direction that the director and writers, hell, even the Lucas led to film and its history, and today the film is considered not only the best Star Wars ever made, but also one of the best sequel of a saga in the cinema. If Lucas in the 1st film had already revolutionized the modern cinema, so here he and his team raised barriers never explored. While the 1st movie had the great adventure of Luke going to rescue the princess from evil forces in a massive sci-fi style full of humor and thrilling moments. In this one he maintain the great sense of adventure and the humor is not lacking thanks to Han, but here everything is brought to a much more human side thanks to its unforgettable characters. And also thanks to the writers who deliver an amazing and beautiful narrative to the characters since small to big dialogues between the characters showing their human side, and also further exploring the "Jedi" topic that it wasn't been well explored in the 1st movie. But also the other side where the film is taken is into a very dark twist that began when dark secrets from the past begin to appear. A flawless script and characters very well evolved, but also at the technical aspects the film rises completely. From the incredible visual effects with a beautiful visual direction from Kershner. And also the new and memorable soundtrack from John Williams "The Imperial March", you know, that dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan, dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan (I know, it's strange to describe a song writing and not listening, well anyway)?! Not only the best "Star Wars" or the best sequel ever made, but also one of the best movies ever made will be marked forever in the history of cinema. All thanks to a flawless script, beautiful direction, strong performances (especially Mark Hamill with an incredible evolution of acting) and the biggest twist that cinema ever had makes "Empire Strikes Back" an eternal masterpiece! 10/10

    The movie is completely an excellent work of art.I love this movie as it has a very close place in my heart.No,I have not seen this movie a hundred times just like the person next door,I have only seen this brilliant masterpiece a merely 3 times,I was not born n the 90s and definitely did not see it when it was first launched as I was born in 2001.It has only been a half a year since I saw this movie and I was just so sad on the fact that I was not born earlier. Although the storyline may seem a little bit not as good as the earlier one (Ep.4 A New Hope) but it lived up to its hype,and then some(believe me,that some is a lot.).Extremely brilliant,The Imperial March is my cellphone's ring-tone now,although it gets a little weird sometimes.Frank Oz as Yoda is amazing.The entire cast is brilliant,this is my favorite movie of the entire franchise. Now All we can do is re-watch these movies and just wait for the next sequel trilogy (containing ep.7,8 and 9.)and see how Star Wars results when it is put under direction by Disney and passed on to the next generation(which is supposed to be mine ?) under J.J Abrams. May the Force be with you!

    This by far is my favorite movie of all time. Of Course I saw the original Star Wars when it first came out in theaters in 1977 which blew my mind and took me on the adventure of a lifetime. But Empire is the best of the three original films. It's ability to connect the characters in a more personal way and to reveal how deeply each character affects the progression of the story. Each scene and sequence moves the viewer closer and closer to a pivotal point where the characters are also paired as an influential unit relevant to a particular plot. Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, Princess Lea and Han Solo, which interconnect with the other pairs Han Solo/Luke Skywalker and Vader/Lea. The flow of dialog from these characters help create a malleable cohesion as to help support the type of character in which they each portray; hero, villain, damsel in distress and rouge smuggler. Besides all that this space and time adventure brought the audience into the story and helped create a new mythical journey. I have since watched this movie hundreds of times over the years, will always be the one movie that influence my imagination and will continue to watch it even more.

    This movie was awesome! I loved the characters (Vader was my favourite). I loved the story (Including the plot twist with Darth Vader the father of Luke Skywalker). And I loved the visuals (For a 1980 movie, the effects are brilliant). And it's kinda funny this movie wasn't directed by George Lucas (Instead it's directed by Irvin Kershner while George was the executive producer). My favourite scene in this movie would have to be The Battle of Hoth because the soundtrack, visuals and acting were all spot on. Speaking of the soundtrack, John Williams must've had a wonderful time creating the pieces of music in this film. I would highly recommend you see this movie (Either on TV or a DVD), you'll have a wonderful time.

    Episode V(as it became known) is the best entry in the six-film series, since it is the best written(really strong dialogue, situations, and realistic evolution of the returning characters) phenomenal direction by Irvin Kirshner(exciting and breathless, always something going on of interest) and equally spectacular F/X, which still hold up(did not need much tweaking for the Special Editions) Story has the Empire striking back(of course!) against the rebellion(despite the loss of the Death Star) and our heroes' attempts to survive and enact their next plan of attack, only to become captured by an unwitting betrayal of old friend Lando(Billy Dee Williams, quite smooth but appealing). Climactic battle between Luke and Darth Vader is legendary, and breathtaking. Cliffhanger ending sets up the final(?) chapter nicely. A classic.

    I remember going to the movie theater to watch the premiere of Star Wars... This experience totally blew my mind!!! I had never experienced anything quite as powerful before. I felt like similar adventures may actually be happening in other galaxies, far, far away and we think we are alone on our little planet... I obviously ran to the theater one more time as soon as The Empire Strikes Back hit the silver screen. Then that was it. From the first images, I was like in command of a Snowspeeder! This visuals were simply mesmerizing, should I say Striking! From this day, I knew I wanted to be part of something like that... one day. I am not there yet, but I am now a CG artist, working very hard at perfecting my art, looking at every detail that can make each of my model more realistic, more believable. I am also writing and producing a sci-fi movie: Apostone 'resurrection'. A mix of CG animation and acting. I am realizing my dream since I met Star Wars the sandman.

    This movie is so amazing for so many reasons but the one thing I have to say is the greatest is that the bad guys are winning the entire time. Lucas had to capture his audience in the first film and no one likes a film where the bad guys wins. However once he had established the rebellion and set up the characters he was free to do some good guy bashing. You know who the good guys and bad guys are, you know how these types of stories typically end (with the good guys winning) so you know that no matter what happens in the middle movie, it has to end well. With that in mind, why not make the rebels lose, cut off Luke's hand, and freeze Han in carbonite. It keeps the watching at the edge of his seat wanting to know whats going to happen.

    Well I have to say that I am a fan of the old and classic movies of the cinema and not the new ones. Star Wars is not just a movie, is the beginning of a new era, it's the beginning and the peak of movies with space and its defense. When I saw the "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back" I was really amazed not because of the graphics of this movie but because that was something different, something that it's a landmark of the cinema and for all the people. It's a movie with which comes the end of this trilogy. With this movie comes the end of the adventures, the agony and the expectation of what it's going to happen. In this movie everything ends with only one winner and who is going to be? Luke Skywalker or the Dark Lord? If you want to now the end of this movie you have to see it...

    Star Wars the Empire Strikes Back is not only the greatest film of the original three, but the greatest film in history. It contains the perfect combination of great story telling and spectacles that blew the minds of its time and continues to do this years after it first released. The film thrusts into a darker more serious premise than that of the previous one. Though the film is considerably darker it still has the great mythology, excitement and adventure of the first one. The film is full of outstanding moments that have won their place in movie history. What sets this film aside from others is its not-commonly seen ending. The film ends on a high and unusual note that leaves one wanting more. This film has and will continue standing the test of time for many years to come.

    Grade: A- Star Wars the Empire Strikes Back is an excellent film too and is another amazing film that has a darker tone then the first film and has a huge twist that is probably the most shocking twist in cinema history that is really puzzling, but makes sense. Currently, the Rebels and Sith are fighting on a snowy planet called Hoth and Luke is one of the pilots fighting while Han and Leia are in the Hoth base and need to escape. They escape and Luke does too, but Han must weave the Millennium Falcon away from the Death Star and Luke crash lands on a planet called Dagobah. There, he meets a green creature who is a Jedi master and legend, Yoda. He teaches him how to use the force and helps him confront his fears like battling Vader. Han sends his group to Cloud City and meet up with a friend named Lando who likes Leia, but he is working for Vader under force. Han is frozen and taken away, but Lando helps take Leia and Chewbacca out of the city. Now Luke enters Cloud City to fight Vader and near the end of their fight Luke looses a hand and to escape Vader, he falls and is hanging for dear life under the floating city. While Lando is helping them escape, Leia gets a feeling that Luke is in trouble and where he is, maybe the force, and they go save him. This film is well told, darker, and is filled with pleasant surprises, but you can't have this without the first. This is a great sequel and it deserves all the praise it's getting, but you can't have this without number one.

Currently, the Rebels and Sith are fighting on a snowy planet called Hoth and Luke is one of the pilots fighting while Han and Leia are in the Hoth base and need to escape. They escape and Luke does too, but Han must weave the Millennium Falcon away from the Death Star and Luke crash lands on a planet called Dagobah. There, he meets a green creature who is a Jedi master and legend, Yoda. He teaches him how to use the force and helps him confront his fears like battling Vader. Han sends his group to Cloud City and meet up with a friend named Lando who likes Leia, but he is working for Vader under force. Han is frozen and taken away, but Lando helps take Leia and Chewbacca out of the city. Now Luke enters Cloud City to fight Vader and near the end of their fight Luke looses a hand and to escape Vader, he falls and is hanging for dear life under the floating city. While Lando is helping them escape, Leia gets a feeling that Luke is in trouble and where he is, maybe the force, and they go save him. This film is well told, darker, and is filled with pleasant surprises, but you can't have this without the first. This is a great sequel and it deserves all the praise it's getting, but you can't have this without number one.

    After the huge success of "Star Wars" both critical and in the box office, giving birth to a new era cinema. George Lucas was already planning its sequel, but decided to divide his work with the director Irvin Kershner and screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, many fans were afraid (even with Lucas writing the story), but this group brought the saga to a all-new and unexplored level. "Empire" begins shortly after the huge events of its predecessor with the entire rebel army after destroying the " Death Star", fleeing through galaxy with the powerful imperial fleet right behind them with ruthless Darth Vader (David Prowse) in command. And with the rebels we see Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) finally realizing his dream of becoming a pilot in the rebel army against the empire, and alongside him his "inseparable" friends: the brave and cocky (and Badass) Han Solo (Harrison Ford); the brave and intelligent Leia (Carrie Fisher); the.....Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew); R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). But their lives begin to suffer a great risk when the Empire finds the rebel position in the ice world of Hoth, where a huge battle starts forcing the rebels to retreat. Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C - 3PO manage to escape in the Millennium Falcon, but end up being captured later by Darth Vader thanks to a betrayal of Han's friend, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Luke and R2 were able to escape as well, but with the voice instruction from Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), Luke is advised to go to the Dagobah system and meet the Jedi master Yoda (Frank Oz) which will help Luke know and control the "strength", which later will bring him sinister secrets and the sacrifice for his friends. At the time it came-out, the film was poorly received by critics and fans, but perhaps understandable. No one at the time expected to see a major change in direction that the director and writers, hell, even the Lucas led to film and its history, and today the film is considered not only the best Star Wars ever made, but also one of the best sequel of a saga in the cinema. If Lucas in the 1st film had already revolutionized the modern cinema, so here he and his team raised barriers never explored. While the 1st movie had the great adventure of Luke going to rescue the princess from evil forces in a massive sci-fi style full of humor and thrilling moments. In this one he maintain the great sense of adventure and the humor is not lacking thanks to Han, but here everything is brought to a much more human side thanks to its unforgettable characters. And also thanks to the writers who deliver an amazing and beautiful narrative to the characters since small to big dialogues between the characters showing their human side, and also further exploring the "Jedi" topic that it wasn't been well explored in the 1st movie. But also the other side where the film is taken is into a very dark twist that began when dark secrets from the past begin to appear. A flawless script and characters very well evolved, but also at the technical aspects the film rises completely. From the incredible visual effects with a beautiful visual direction from Kershner. And also the new and memorable soundtrack from John Williams "The Imperial March", you know, that dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan, dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan (I know, it's strange to describe a song writing and not listening, well anyway)?! Not only the best "Star Wars" or the best sequel ever made, but also one of the best movies ever made will be marked forever in the history of cinema. All thanks to a flawless script, beautiful direction, strong performances (especially Mark Hamill with an incredible evolution of acting) and the biggest twist that cinema ever had makes "Empire Strikes Back" an eternal masterpiece! 10/10

    The movie is completely an excellent work of art.I love this movie as it has a very close place in my heart.No,I have not seen this movie a hundred times just like the person next door,I have only seen this brilliant masterpiece a merely 3 times,I was not born n the 90s and definitely did not see it when it was first launched as I was born in 2001.It has only been a half a year since I saw this movie and I was just so sad on the fact that I was not born earlier. Although the storyline may seem a little bit not as good as the earlier one (Ep.4 A New Hope) but it lived up to its hype,and then some(believe me,that some is a lot.).Extremely brilliant,The Imperial March is my cellphone's ring-tone now,although it gets a little weird sometimes.Frank Oz as Yoda is amazing.The entire cast is brilliant,this is my favorite movie of the entire franchise. Now All we can do is re-watch these movies and just wait for the next sequel trilogy (containing ep.7,8 and 9.)and see how Star Wars results when it is put under direction by Disney and passed on to the next generation(which is supposed to be mine ?) under J.J Abrams. May the Force be with you!

    This by far is my favorite movie of all time. Of Course I saw the original Star Wars when it first came out in theaters in 1977 which blew my mind and took me on the adventure of a lifetime. But Empire is the best of the three original films. It's ability to connect the characters in a more personal way and to reveal how deeply each character affects the progression of the story. Each scene and sequence moves the viewer closer and closer to a pivotal point where the characters are also paired as an influential unit relevant to a particular plot. Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, Princess Lea and Han Solo, which interconnect with the other pairs Han Solo/Luke Skywalker and Vader/Lea. The flow of dialog from these characters help create a malleable cohesion as to help support the type of character in which they each portray; hero, villain, damsel in distress and rouge smuggler. Besides all that this space and time adventure brought the audience into the story and helped create a new mythical journey. I have since watched this movie hundreds of times over the years, will always be the one movie that influence my imagination and will continue to watch it even more.

    This movie was awesome! I loved the characters (Vader was my favourite). I loved the story (Including the plot twist with Darth Vader the father of Luke Skywalker). And I loved the visuals (For a 1980 movie, the effects are brilliant). And it's kinda funny this movie wasn't directed by George Lucas (Instead it's directed by Irvin Kershner while George was the executive producer). My favourite scene in this movie would have to be The Battle of Hoth because the soundtrack, visuals and acting were all spot on. Speaking of the soundtrack, John Williams must've had a wonderful time creating the pieces of music in this film. I would highly recommend you see this movie (Either on TV or a DVD), you'll have a wonderful time.

    Episode V(as it became known) is the best entry in the six-film series, since it is the best written(really strong dialogue, situations, and realistic evolution of the returning characters) phenomenal direction by Irvin Kirshner(exciting and breathless, always something going on of interest) and equally spectacular F/X, which still hold up(did not need much tweaking for the Special Editions) Story has the Empire striking back(of course!) against the rebellion(despite the loss of the Death Star) and our heroes' attempts to survive and enact their next plan of attack, only to become captured by an unwitting betrayal of old friend Lando(Billy Dee Williams, quite smooth but appealing). Climactic battle between Luke and Darth Vader is legendary, and breathtaking. Cliffhanger ending sets up the final(?) chapter nicely. A classic.

    I remember going to the movie theater to watch the premiere of Star Wars... This experience totally blew my mind!!! I had never experienced anything quite as powerful before. I felt like similar adventures may actually be happening in other galaxies, far, far away and we think we are alone on our little planet... I obviously ran to the theater one more time as soon as The Empire Strikes Back hit the silver screen. Then that was it. From the first images, I was like in command of a Snowspeeder! This visuals were simply mesmerizing, should I say Striking! From this day, I knew I wanted to be part of something like that... one day. I am not there yet, but I am now a CG artist, working very hard at perfecting my art, looking at every detail that can make each of my model more realistic, more believable. I am also writing and producing a sci-fi movie: Apostone 'resurrection'. A mix of CG animation and acting. I am realizing my dream since I met Star Wars the sandman.

    This movie is so amazing for so many reasons but the one thing I have to say is the greatest is that the bad guys are winning the entire time. Lucas had to capture his audience in the first film and no one likes a film where the bad guys wins. However once he had established the rebellion and set up the characters he was free to do some good guy bashing. You know who the good guys and bad guys are, you know how these types of stories typically end (with the good guys winning) so you know that no matter what happens in the middle movie, it has to end well. With that in mind, why not make the rebels lose, cut off Luke's hand, and freeze Han in carbonite. It keeps the watching at the edge of his seat wanting to know whats going to happen.

    Well I have to say that I am a fan of the old and classic movies of the cinema and not the new ones. Star Wars is not just a movie, is the beginning of a new era, it's the beginning and the peak of movies with space and its defense. When I saw the "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back" I was really amazed not because of the graphics of this movie but because that was something different, something that it's a landmark of the cinema and for all the people. It's a movie with which comes the end of this trilogy. With this movie comes the end of the adventures, the agony and the expectation of what it's going to happen. In this movie everything ends with only one winner and who is going to be? Luke Skywalker or the Dark Lord? If you want to now the end of this movie you have to see it...

    Star Wars the Empire Strikes Back is not only the greatest film of the original three, but the greatest film in history. It contains the perfect combination of great story telling and spectacles that blew the minds of its time and continues to do this years after it first released. The film thrusts into a darker more serious premise than that of the previous one. Though the film is considerably darker it still has the great mythology, excitement and adventure of the first one. The film is full of outstanding moments that have won their place in movie history. What sets this film aside from others is its not-commonly seen ending. The film ends on a high and unusual note that leaves one wanting more. This film has and will continue standing the test of time for many years to come.

    After the huge success of "Star Wars" both critical and in the box office, giving birth to a new era cinema. George Lucas was already planning its sequel, but decided to divide his work with the director Irvin Kershner and screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, many fans were afraid (even with Lucas writing the story), but this group brought the saga to a all-new and unexplored level. "Empire" begins shortly after the huge events of its predecessor with the entire rebel army after destroying the " Death Star", fleeing through galaxy with the powerful imperial fleet right behind them with ruthless Darth Vader (David Prowse) in command. And with the rebels we see Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) finally realizing his dream of becoming a pilot in the rebel army against the empire, and alongside him his "inseparable" friends: the brave and cocky (and Badass) Han Solo (Harrison Ford); the brave and intelligent Leia (Carrie Fisher); the.....Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew); R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). But their lives begin to suffer a great risk when the Empire finds the rebel position in the ice world of Hoth, where a huge battle starts forcing the rebels to retreat. Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C - 3PO manage to escape in the Millennium Falcon, but end up being captured later by Darth Vader thanks to a betrayal of Han's friend, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Luke and R2 were able to escape as well, but with the voice instruction from Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), Luke is advised to go to the Dagobah system and meet the Jedi master Yoda (Frank Oz) which will help Luke know and control the "strength", which later will bring him sinister secrets and the sacrifice for his friends. At the time it came-out, the film was poorly received by critics and fans, but perhaps understandable. No one at the time expected to see a major change in direction that the director and writers, hell, even the Lucas led to film and its history, and today the film is considered not only the best Star Wars ever made, but also one of the best sequel of a saga in the cinema. If Lucas in the 1st film had already revolutionized the modern cinema, so here he and his team raised barriers never explored. While the 1st movie had the great adventure of Luke going to rescue the princess from evil forces in a massive sci-fi style full of humor and thrilling moments. In this one he maintain the great sense of adventure and the humor is not lacking thanks to Han, but here everything is brought to a much more human side thanks to its unforgettable characters. And also thanks to the writers who deliver an amazing and beautiful narrative to the characters since small to big dialogues between the characters showing their human side, and also further exploring the "Jedi" topic that it wasn't been well explored in the 1st movie. But also the other side where the film is taken is into a very dark twist that began when dark secrets from the past begin to appear. A flawless script and characters very well evolved, but also at the technical aspects the film rises completely. From the incredible visual effects with a beautiful visual direction from Kershner. And also the new and memorable soundtrack from John Williams "The Imperial March", you know, that dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan, dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan (I know, it's strange to describe a song writing and not listening, well anyway)?! Not only the best "Star Wars" or the best sequel ever made, but also one of the best movies ever made will be marked forever in the history of cinema. All thanks to a flawless script, beautiful direction, strong performances (especially Mark Hamill with an incredible evolution of acting) and the biggest twist that cinema ever had makes "Empire Strikes Back" an eternal masterpiece! 10/10

    The movie is completely an excellent work of art.I love this movie as it has a very close place in my heart.No,I have not seen this movie a hundred times just like the person next door,I have only seen this brilliant masterpiece a merely 3 times,I was not born n the 90s and definitely did not see it when it was first launched as I was born in 2001.It has only been a half a year since I saw this movie and I was just so sad on the fact that I was not born earlier. Although the storyline may seem a little bit not as good as the earlier one (Ep.4 A New Hope) but it lived up to its hype,and then some(believe me,that some is a lot.).Extremely brilliant,The Imperial March is my cellphone's ring-tone now,although it gets a little weird sometimes.Frank Oz as Yoda is amazing.The entire cast is brilliant,this is my favorite movie of the entire franchise. Now All we can do is re-watch these movies and just wait for the next sequel trilogy (containing ep.7,8 and 9.)and see how Star Wars results when it is put under direction by Disney and passed on to the next generation(which is supposed to be mine ?) under J.J Abrams. May the Force be with you!

    This by far is my favorite movie of all time. Of Course I saw the original Star Wars when it first came out in theaters in 1977 which blew my mind and took me on the adventure of a lifetime. But Empire is the best of the three original films. It's ability to connect the characters in a more personal way and to reveal how deeply each character affects the progression of the story. Each scene and sequence moves the viewer closer and closer to a pivotal point where the characters are also paired as an influential unit relevant to a particular plot. Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, Princess Lea and Han Solo, which interconnect with the other pairs Han Solo/Luke Skywalker and Vader/Lea. The flow of dialog from these characters help create a malleable cohesion as to help support the type of character in which they each portray; hero, villain, damsel in distress and rouge smuggler. Besides all that this space and time adventure brought the audience into the story and helped create a new mythical journey. I have since watched this movie hundreds of times over the years, will always be the one movie that influence my imagination and will continue to watch it even more.

    This movie was awesome! I loved the characters (Vader was my favourite). I loved the story (Including the plot twist with Darth Vader the father of Luke Skywalker). And I loved the visuals (For a 1980 movie, the effects are brilliant). And it's kinda funny this movie wasn't directed by George Lucas (Instead it's directed by Irvin Kershner while George was the executive producer). My favourite scene in this movie would have to be The Battle of Hoth because the soundtrack, visuals and acting were all spot on. Speaking of the soundtrack, John Williams must've had a wonderful time creating the pieces of music in this film. I would highly recommend you see this movie (Either on TV or a DVD), you'll have a wonderful time.

    Episode V(as it became known) is the best entry in the six-film series, since it is the best written(really strong dialogue, situations, and realistic evolution of the returning characters) phenomenal direction by Irvin Kirshner(exciting and breathless, always something going on of interest) and equally spectacular F/X, which still hold up(did not need much tweaking for the Special Editions) Story has the Empire striking back(of course!) against the rebellion(despite the loss of the Death Star) and our heroes' attempts to survive and enact their next plan of attack, only to become captured by an unwitting betrayal of old friend Lando(Billy Dee Williams, quite smooth but appealing). Climactic battle between Luke and Darth Vader is legendary, and breathtaking. Cliffhanger ending sets up the final(?) chapter nicely. A classic.

    I remember going to the movie theater to watch the premiere of Star Wars... This experience totally blew my mind!!! I had never experienced anything quite as powerful before. I felt like similar adventures may actually be happening in other galaxies, far, far away and we think we are alone on our little planet... I obviously ran to the theater one more time as soon as The Empire Strikes Back hit the silver screen. Then that was it. From the first images, I was like in command of a Snowspeeder! This visuals were simply mesmerizing, should I say Striking! From this day, I knew I wanted to be part of something like that... one day. I am not there yet, but I am now a CG artist, working very hard at perfecting my art, looking at every detail that can make each of my model more realistic, more believable. I am also writing and producing a sci-fi movie: Apostone 'resurrection'. A mix of CG animation and acting. I am realizing my dream since I met Star Wars the sandman.

    This movie is so amazing for so many reasons but the one thing I have to say is the greatest is that the bad guys are winning the entire time. Lucas had to capture his audience in the first film and no one likes a film where the bad guys wins. However once he had established the rebellion and set up the characters he was free to do some good guy bashing. You know who the good guys and bad guys are, you know how these types of stories typically end (with the good guys winning) so you know that no matter what happens in the middle movie, it has to end well. With that in mind, why not make the rebels lose, cut off Luke's hand, and freeze Han in carbonite. It keeps the watching at the edge of his seat wanting to know whats going to happen.

    Well I have to say that I am a fan of the old and classic movies of the cinema and not the new ones. Star Wars is not just a movie, is the beginning of a new era, it's the beginning and the peak of movies with space and its defense. When I saw the "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back" I was really amazed not because of the graphics of this movie but because that was something different, something that it's a landmark of the cinema and for all the people. It's a movie with which comes the end of this trilogy. With this movie comes the end of the adventures, the agony and the expectation of what it's going to happen. In this movie everything ends with only one winner and who is going to be? Luke Skywalker or the Dark Lord? If you want to now the end of this movie you have to see it...

    Star Wars the Empire Strikes Back is not only the greatest film of the original three, but the greatest film in history. It contains the perfect combination of great story telling and spectacles that blew the minds of its time and continues to do this years after it first released. The film thrusts into a darker more serious premise than that of the previous one. Though the film is considerably darker it still has the great mythology, excitement and adventure of the first one. The film is full of outstanding moments that have won their place in movie history. What sets this film aside from others is its not-commonly seen ending. The film ends on a high and unusual note that leaves one wanting more. This film has and will continue standing the test of time for many years to come.

    Grade: A- Star Wars the Empire Strikes Back is an excellent film too and is another amazing film that has a darker tone then the first film and has a huge twist that is probably the most shocking twist in cinema history that is really puzzling, but makes sense. Currently, the Rebels and Sith are fighting on a snowy planet called Hoth and Luke is one of the pilots fighting while Han and Leia are in the Hoth base and need to escape. They escape and Luke does too, but Han must weave the Millennium Falcon away from the Death Star and Luke crash lands on a planet called Dagobah. There, he meets a green creature who is a Jedi master and legend, Yoda. He teaches him how to use the force and helps him confront his fears like battling Vader. Han sends his group to Cloud City and meet up with a friend named Lando who likes Leia, but he is working for Vader under force. Han is frozen and taken away, but Lando helps take Leia and Chewbacca out of the city. Now Luke enters Cloud City to fight Vader and near the end of their fight Luke looses a hand and to escape Vader, he falls and is hanging for dear life under the floating city. While Lando is helping them escape, Leia gets a feeling that Luke is in trouble and where he is, maybe the force, and they go save him. This film is well told, darker, and is filled with pleasant surprises, but you can't have this without the first. This is a great sequel and it deserves all the praise it's getting, but you can't have this without number one.

And with the rebels we see Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) finally realizing his dream of becoming a pilot in the rebel army against the empire, and alongside him his "inseparable" friends: the brave and cocky (and Badass) Han Solo (Harrison Ford); the brave and intelligent Leia (Carrie Fisher); the.....Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew); R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). But their lives begin to suffer a great risk when the Empire finds the rebel position in the ice world of Hoth, where a huge battle starts forcing the rebels to retreat. Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C - 3PO manage to escape in the Millennium Falcon, but end up being captured later by Darth Vader thanks to a betrayal of Han's friend, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Luke and R2 were able to escape as well, but with the voice instruction from Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), Luke is advised to go to the Dagobah system and meet the Jedi master Yoda (Frank Oz) which will help Luke know and control the "strength", which later will bring him sinister secrets and the sacrifice for his friends. At the time it came-out, the film was poorly received by critics and fans, but perhaps understandable. No one at the time expected to see a major change in direction that the director and writers, hell, even the Lucas led to film and its history, and today the film is considered not only the best Star Wars ever made, but also one of the best sequel of a saga in the cinema. If Lucas in the 1st film had already revolutionized the modern cinema, so here he and his team raised barriers never explored. While the 1st movie had the great adventure of Luke going to rescue the princess from evil forces in a massive sci-fi style full of humor and thrilling moments. In this one he maintain the great sense of adventure and the humor is not lacking thanks to Han, but here everything is brought to a much more human side thanks to its unforgettable characters. And also thanks to the writers who deliver an amazing and beautiful narrative to the characters since small to big dialogues between the characters showing their human side, and also further exploring the "Jedi" topic that it wasn't been well explored in the 1st movie. But also the other side where the film is taken is into a very dark twist that began when dark secrets from the past begin to appear. A flawless script and characters very well evolved, but also at the technical aspects the film rises completely. From the incredible visual effects with a beautiful visual direction from Kershner. And also the new and memorable soundtrack from John Williams "The Imperial March", you know, that dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan, dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan (I know, it's strange to describe a song writing and not listening, well anyway)?! Not only the best "Star Wars" or the best sequel ever made, but also one of the best movies ever made will be marked forever in the history of cinema. All thanks to a flawless script, beautiful direction, strong performances (especially Mark Hamill with an incredible evolution of acting) and the biggest twist that cinema ever had makes "Empire Strikes Back" an eternal masterpiece! 10/10

    The movie is completely an excellent work of art.I love this movie as it has a very close place in my heart.No,I have not seen this movie a hundred times just like the person next door,I have only seen this brilliant masterpiece a merely 3 times,I was not born n the 90s and definitely did not see it when it was first launched as I was born in 2001.It has only been a half a year since I saw this movie and I was just so sad on the fact that I was not born earlier. Although the storyline may seem a little bit not as good as the earlier one (Ep.4 A New Hope) but it lived up to its hype,and then some(believe me,that some is a lot.).Extremely brilliant,The Imperial March is my cellphone's ring-tone now,although it gets a little weird sometimes.Frank Oz as Yoda is amazing.The entire cast is brilliant,this is my favorite movie of the entire franchise. Now All we can do is re-watch these movies and just wait for the next sequel trilogy (containing ep.7,8 and 9.)and see how Star Wars results when it is put under direction by Disney and passed on to the next generation(which is supposed to be mine ?) under J.J Abrams. May the Force be with you!

    This by far is my favorite movie of all time. Of Course I saw the original Star Wars when it first came out in theaters in 1977 which blew my mind and took me on the adventure of a lifetime. But Empire is the best of the three original films. It's ability to connect the characters in a more personal way and to reveal how deeply each character affects the progression of the story. Each scene and sequence moves the viewer closer and closer to a pivotal point where the characters are also paired as an influential unit relevant to a particular plot. Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, Princess Lea and Han Solo, which interconnect with the other pairs Han Solo/Luke Skywalker and Vader/Lea. The flow of dialog from these characters help create a malleable cohesion as to help support the type of character in which they each portray; hero, villain, damsel in distress and rouge smuggler. Besides all that this space and time adventure brought the audience into the story and helped create a new mythical journey. I have since watched this movie hundreds of times over the years, will always be the one movie that influence my imagination and will continue to watch it even more.

    This movie was awesome! I loved the characters (Vader was my favourite). I loved the story (Including the plot twist with Darth Vader the father of Luke Skywalker). And I loved the visuals (For a 1980 movie, the effects are brilliant). And it's kinda funny this movie wasn't directed by George Lucas (Instead it's directed by Irvin Kershner while George was the executive producer). My favourite scene in this movie would have to be The Battle of Hoth because the soundtrack, visuals and acting were all spot on. Speaking of the soundtrack, John Williams must've had a wonderful time creating the pieces of music in this film. I would highly recommend you see this movie (Either on TV or a DVD), you'll have a wonderful time.

    Episode V(as it became known) is the best entry in the six-film series, since it is the best written(really strong dialogue, situations, and realistic evolution of the returning characters) phenomenal direction by Irvin Kirshner(exciting and breathless, always something going on of interest) and equally spectacular F/X, which still hold up(did not need much tweaking for the Special Editions) Story has the Empire striking back(of course!) against the rebellion(despite the loss of the Death Star) and our heroes' attempts to survive and enact their next plan of attack, only to become captured by an unwitting betrayal of old friend Lando(Billy Dee Williams, quite smooth but appealing). Climactic battle between Luke and Darth Vader is legendary, and breathtaking. Cliffhanger ending sets up the final(?) chapter nicely. A classic.

    I remember going to the movie theater to watch the premiere of Star Wars... This experience totally blew my mind!!! I had never experienced anything quite as powerful before. I felt like similar adventures may actually be happening in other galaxies, far, far away and we think we are alone on our little planet... I obviously ran to the theater one more time as soon as The Empire Strikes Back hit the silver screen. Then that was it. From the first images, I was like in command of a Snowspeeder! This visuals were simply mesmerizing, should I say Striking! From this day, I knew I wanted to be part of something like that... one day. I am not there yet, but I am now a CG artist, working very hard at perfecting my art, looking at every detail that can make each of my model more realistic, more believable. I am also writing and producing a sci-fi movie: Apostone 'resurrection'. A mix of CG animation and acting. I am realizing my dream since I met Star Wars the sandman.

    This movie is so amazing for so many reasons but the one thing I have to say is the greatest is that the bad guys are winning the entire time. Lucas had to capture his audience in the first film and no one likes a film where the bad guys wins. However once he had established the rebellion and set up the characters he was free to do some good guy bashing. You know who the good guys and bad guys are, you know how these types of stories typically end (with the good guys winning) so you know that no matter what happens in the middle movie, it has to end well. With that in mind, why not make the rebels lose, cut off Luke's hand, and freeze Han in carbonite. It keeps the watching at the edge of his seat wanting to know whats going to happen.

    Well I have to say that I am a fan of the old and classic movies of the cinema and not the new ones. Star Wars is not just a movie, is the beginning of a new era, it's the beginning and the peak of movies with space and its defense. When I saw the "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back" I was really amazed not because of the graphics of this movie but because that was something different, something that it's a landmark of the cinema and for all the people. It's a movie with which comes the end of this trilogy. With this movie comes the end of the adventures, the agony and the expectation of what it's going to happen. In this movie everything ends with only one winner and who is going to be? Luke Skywalker or the Dark Lord? If you want to now the end of this movie you have to see it...

    Star Wars the Empire Strikes Back is not only the greatest film of the original three, but the greatest film in history. It contains the perfect combination of great story telling and spectacles that blew the minds of its time and continues to do this years after it first released. The film thrusts into a darker more serious premise than that of the previous one. Though the film is considerably darker it still has the great mythology, excitement and adventure of the first one. The film is full of outstanding moments that have won their place in movie history. What sets this film aside from others is its not-commonly seen ending. The film ends on a high and unusual note that leaves one wanting more. This film has and will continue standing the test of time for many years to come.

    Grade: A- Star Wars the Empire Strikes Back is an excellent film too and is another amazing film that has a darker tone then the first film and has a huge twist that is probably the most shocking twist in cinema history that is really puzzling, but makes sense. Currently, the Rebels and Sith are fighting on a snowy planet called Hoth and Luke is one of the pilots fighting while Han and Leia are in the Hoth base and need to escape. They escape and Luke does too, but Han must weave the Millennium Falcon away from the Death Star and Luke crash lands on a planet called Dagobah. There, he meets a green creature who is a Jedi master and legend, Yoda. He teaches him how to use the force and helps him confront his fears like battling Vader. Han sends his group to Cloud City and meet up with a friend named Lando who likes Leia, but he is working for Vader under force. Han is frozen and taken away, but Lando helps take Leia and Chewbacca out of the city. Now Luke enters Cloud City to fight Vader and near the end of their fight Luke looses a hand and to escape Vader, he falls and is hanging for dear life under the floating city. While Lando is helping them escape, Leia gets a feeling that Luke is in trouble and where he is, maybe the force, and they go save him. This film is well told, darker, and is filled with pleasant surprises, but you can't have this without the first. This is a great sequel and it deserves all the praise it's getting, but you can't have this without number one.

At the time it came-out, the film was poorly received by critics and fans, but perhaps understandable. No one at the time expected to see a major change in direction that the director and writers, hell, even the Lucas led to film and its history, and today the film is considered not only the best Star Wars ever made, but also one of the best sequel of a saga in the cinema. If Lucas in the 1st film had already revolutionized the modern cinema, so here he and his team raised barriers never explored. While the 1st movie had the great adventure of Luke going to rescue the princess from evil forces in a massive sci-fi style full of humor and thrilling moments. In this one he maintain the great sense of adventure and the humor is not lacking thanks to Han, but here everything is brought to a much more human side thanks to its unforgettable characters. And also thanks to the writers who deliver an amazing and beautiful narrative to the characters since small to big dialogues between the characters showing their human side, and also further exploring the "Jedi" topic that it wasn't been well explored in the 1st movie. But also the other side where the film is taken is into a very dark twist that began when dark secrets from the past begin to appear. A flawless script and characters very well evolved, but also at the technical aspects the film rises completely. From the incredible visual effects with a beautiful visual direction from Kershner. And also the new and memorable soundtrack from John Williams "The Imperial March", you know, that dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan, dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan (I know, it's strange to describe a song writing and not listening, well anyway)?! Not only the best "Star Wars" or the best sequel ever made, but also one of the best movies ever made will be marked forever in the history of cinema. All thanks to a flawless script, beautiful direction, strong performances (especially Mark Hamill with an incredible evolution of acting) and the biggest twist that cinema ever had makes "Empire Strikes Back" an eternal masterpiece! 10/10

    The movie is completely an excellent work of art.I love this movie as it has a very close place in my heart.No,I have not seen this movie a hundred times just like the person next door,I have only seen this brilliant masterpiece a merely 3 times,I was not born n the 90s and definitely did not see it when it was first launched as I was born in 2001.It has only been a half a year since I saw this movie and I was just so sad on the fact that I was not born earlier. Although the storyline may seem a little bit not as good as the earlier one (Ep.4 A New Hope) but it lived up to its hype,and then some(believe me,that some is a lot.).Extremely brilliant,The Imperial March is my cellphone's ring-tone now,although it gets a little weird sometimes.Frank Oz as Yoda is amazing.The entire cast is brilliant,this is my favorite movie of the entire franchise. Now All we can do is re-watch these movies and just wait for the next sequel trilogy (containing ep.7,8 and 9.)and see how Star Wars results when it is put under direction by Disney and passed on to the next generation(which is supposed to be mine ?) under J.J Abrams. May the Force be with you!

    This by far is my favorite movie of all time. Of Course I saw the original Star Wars when it first came out in theaters in 1977 which blew my mind and took me on the adventure of a lifetime. But Empire is the best of the three original films. It's ability to connect the characters in a more personal way and to reveal how deeply each character affects the progression of the story. Each scene and sequence moves the viewer closer and closer to a pivotal point where the characters are also paired as an influential unit relevant to a particular plot. Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, Princess Lea and Han Solo, which interconnect with the other pairs Han Solo/Luke Skywalker and Vader/Lea. The flow of dialog from these characters help create a malleable cohesion as to help support the type of character in which they each portray; hero, villain, damsel in distress and rouge smuggler. Besides all that this space and time adventure brought the audience into the story and helped create a new mythical journey. I have since watched this movie hundreds of times over the years, will always be the one movie that influence my imagination and will continue to watch it even more.

    This movie was awesome! I loved the characters (Vader was my favourite). I loved the story (Including the plot twist with Darth Vader the father of Luke Skywalker). And I loved the visuals (For a 1980 movie, the effects are brilliant). And it's kinda funny this movie wasn't directed by George Lucas (Instead it's directed by Irvin Kershner while George was the executive producer). My favourite scene in this movie would have to be The Battle of Hoth because the soundtrack, visuals and acting were all spot on. Speaking of the soundtrack, John Williams must've had a wonderful time creating the pieces of music in this film. I would highly recommend you see this movie (Either on TV or a DVD), you'll have a wonderful time.

    Episode V(as it became known) is the best entry in the six-film series, since it is the best written(really strong dialogue, situations, and realistic evolution of the returning characters) phenomenal direction by Irvin Kirshner(exciting and breathless, always something going on of interest) and equally spectacular F/X, which still hold up(did not need much tweaking for the Special Editions) Story has the Empire striking back(of course!) against the rebellion(despite the loss of the Death Star) and our heroes' attempts to survive and enact their next plan of attack, only to become captured by an unwitting betrayal of old friend Lando(Billy Dee Williams, quite smooth but appealing). Climactic battle between Luke and Darth Vader is legendary, and breathtaking. Cliffhanger ending sets up the final(?) chapter nicely. A classic.

    I remember going to the movie theater to watch the premiere of Star Wars... This experience totally blew my mind!!! I had never experienced anything quite as powerful before. I felt like similar adventures may actually be happening in other galaxies, far, far away and we think we are alone on our little planet... I obviously ran to the theater one more time as soon as The Empire Strikes Back hit the silver screen. Then that was it. From the first images, I was like in command of a Snowspeeder! This visuals were simply mesmerizing, should I say Striking! From this day, I knew I wanted to be part of something like that... one day. I am not there yet, but I am now a CG artist, working very hard at perfecting my art, looking at every detail that can make each of my model more realistic, more believable. I am also writing and producing a sci-fi movie: Apostone 'resurrection'. A mix of CG animation and acting. I am realizing my dream since I met Star Wars the sandman.

    This movie is so amazing for so many reasons but the one thing I have to say is the greatest is that the bad guys are winning the entire time. Lucas had to capture his audience in the first film and no one likes a film where the bad guys wins. However once he had established the rebellion and set up the characters he was free to do some good guy bashing. You know who the good guys and bad guys are, you know how these types of stories typically end (with the good guys winning) so you know that no matter what happens in the middle movie, it has to end well. With that in mind, why not make the rebels lose, cut off Luke's hand, and freeze Han in carbonite. It keeps the watching at the edge of his seat wanting to know whats going to happen.

    Well I have to say that I am a fan of the old and classic movies of the cinema and not the new ones. Star Wars is not just a movie, is the beginning of a new era, it's the beginning and the peak of movies with space and its defense. When I saw the "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back" I was really amazed not because of the graphics of this movie but because that was something different, something that it's a landmark of the cinema and for all the people. It's a movie with which comes the end of this trilogy. With this movie comes the end of the adventures, the agony and the expectation of what it's going to happen. In this movie everything ends with only one winner and who is going to be? Luke Skywalker or the Dark Lord? If you want to now the end of this movie you have to see it...

    Star Wars the Empire Strikes Back is not only the greatest film of the original three, but the greatest film in history. It contains the perfect combination of great story telling and spectacles that blew the minds of its time and continues to do this years after it first released. The film thrusts into a darker more serious premise than that of the previous one. Though the film is considerably darker it still has the great mythology, excitement and adventure of the first one. The film is full of outstanding moments that have won their place in movie history. What sets this film aside from others is its not-commonly seen ending. The film ends on a high and unusual note that leaves one wanting more. This film has and will continue standing the test of time for many years to come.

    Grade: A- Star Wars the Empire Strikes Back is an excellent film too and is another amazing film that has a darker tone then the first film and has a huge twist that is probably the most shocking twist in cinema history that is really puzzling, but makes sense. Currently, the Rebels and Sith are fighting on a snowy planet called Hoth and Luke is one of the pilots fighting while Han and Leia are in the Hoth base and need to escape. They escape and Luke does too, but Han must weave the Millennium Falcon away from the Death Star and Luke crash lands on a planet called Dagobah. There, he meets a green creature who is a Jedi master and legend, Yoda. He teaches him how to use the force and helps him confront his fears like battling Vader. Han sends his group to Cloud City and meet up with a friend named Lando who likes Leia, but he is working for Vader under force. Han is frozen and taken away, but Lando helps take Leia and Chewbacca out of the city. Now Luke enters Cloud City to fight Vader and near the end of their fight Luke looses a hand and to escape Vader, he falls and is hanging for dear life under the floating city. While Lando is helping them escape, Leia gets a feeling that Luke is in trouble and where he is, maybe the force, and they go save him. This film is well told, darker, and is filled with pleasant surprises, but you can't have this without the first. This is a great sequel and it deserves all the praise it's getting, but you can't have this without number one.

    After the huge success of "Star Wars" both critical and in the box office, giving birth to a new era cinema. George Lucas was already planning its sequel, but decided to divide his work with the director Irvin Kershner and screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, many fans were afraid (even with Lucas writing the story), but this group brought the saga to a all-new and unexplored level. "Empire" begins shortly after the huge events of its predecessor with the entire rebel army after destroying the " Death Star", fleeing through galaxy with the powerful imperial fleet right behind them with ruthless Darth Vader (David Prowse) in command. And with the rebels we see Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) finally realizing his dream of becoming a pilot in the rebel army against the empire, and alongside him his "inseparable" friends: the brave and cocky (and Badass) Han Solo (Harrison Ford); the brave and intelligent Leia (Carrie Fisher); the.....Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew); R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). But their lives begin to suffer a great risk when the Empire finds the rebel position in the ice world of Hoth, where a huge battle starts forcing the rebels to retreat. Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C - 3PO manage to escape in the Millennium Falcon, but end up being captured later by Darth Vader thanks to a betrayal of Han's friend, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Luke and R2 were able to escape as well, but with the voice instruction from Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), Luke is advised to go to the Dagobah system and meet the Jedi master Yoda (Frank Oz) which will help Luke know and control the "strength", which later will bring him sinister secrets and the sacrifice for his friends.
