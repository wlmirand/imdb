    first off I thought the movie was very funny , Emilio Estevez once again is very good,, Richard Dreyfus was OK,, I liked Miguel Ferrer's part as the hit-man assigned to the case. Rosie o donell on the other hand I just had to tune out, boy she can really get annoying. Dennis Farina on the other hand was very fun to watch , and had some good one liners to boot.. the plot isn't that bad,, state has to make a case,, the main witness is almost blown to pieces and proceeds to hideout somewhere far away,, but not far enough that our bad guys can't find her without some help.. some of the movie has flaws sure,, but I think mainly that it was made for laughs, and not so much plot points or stuff like that,, if there was a diff leading lady other than Rosie I would have rated it higher for sure.

    Six years after the first "Stakeout" (1987), cameras catch detectives Richard Dreyfuss (as Chris Lecce) and Emilio Estevez (as Bill Reimers) on another mission. It's nowhere near as good as the first. The format is similar. We begin with an action-packed opening. In Las Vegas, mobsters want to kill Cathy Moriarty (as Luella "Lu" Delano) because she's going to testify against them. This leads to the explosion of what appears to be a small town. Police search the rubble, but can't find Ms. Moriarty... They think the missing woman is going to contact a couple - Dennis Farina and Marcia Strassman (as Brian and Pam O'Hara) - so Mr. Dreyfuss and Mr. Estevez are recruited to pose as neighbors... Madeline Stowe (as Maria), from the first film, appears only sporadically and her chemistry with Dreyfuss is gone. The crime and criminals being investigated are confusing. To make the ruse more realistic, assistant district attorney Rosie O'Donnell (as Gina Garrett) is added to the mix. Accompanied by her rottweiler "Archie", Ms. O'Donnell pretends to be Dreyfuss' second wife and Estevez' step-mother. It's a funny situation, providing this sequel with a little freshness. Otherwise, the story is stale. ***** Another Stakeout (7/23/93) John Badham ~ Richard Dreyfuss, Emilio Estevez, Rosie O'Donnell, Dennis Farina

    "Another Stakeout", sequel of 1987's hit "Stakeout", has Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez playing pranksters cops Chris and Bill once again and doing another stakeout. But this time their mission of finding a mob witness (Cathy Moriarty) who might be hiding at the house of some important people, includes a new partner: an attorney (Rosie O'Donnell) who'll be commanding the situation for their despair, who'll have to pretend to be a real nice family while spying on their neighbors. Almost needless to say this is a completely inferior sequel to its exciting predecessor but still a good movie. "Stakeout" was great because it was darker, very tense, and the jokes and humored situations were dead on. It's intriguing that the villains there (two runaway convicts) were far more terrifying than the gangster, the false prosecutor and the sniper (Miguel Ferrer) altogether in this version. I think people at Disney only read the reviews that focused on how terrific the humor were in there, and decided to wipe any traces of violence only focusing on the funny side of the story. What we have here is a good comedy filled with laughter, and tiny doses of action, shots and explosions, relatively interesting, never so thrilling. Chris's marital problems with Maria (played by an uncredited Madeleine Stowe, also from the 1st movie), the priceless jokes on Bill's mustache and the dinner made for the neighbors are part of its warming and hysterical moments. The trio definitely has good chemistry. It should be a little more fast-paced when it comes to action, and trimmed down with the humored bits. It's very simple to follow yet when they try to complicate the plot they end up creating a strange plot hole towards its conclusion. But that's OK. I guess...Anyway, lots of fun but a little disappointing, and yes, I have to say that again, because the first one is awesome. 8/10

    I have this idea of police stakeouts being tiring, laborious things; endless hours, even days, of waiting and waiting for the slightest thing which may not even be of any necessity. I imagine a figure at the forefront of these investigations of immense patience, perhaps a rough but almost always methodical looking individual with the ability to sit and stare; to sit and watch; to ride the storm of sometimes absolutely nothing at all if it means wading out of the other end with something that'll help in the long run. Alas, 1993's Another Stakeout seems to think otherwise; an often loud, often brash and almost constantly unfunny movie dealing with the above like a Looney Tunes cartoon would the issue of hunting rabbits. The film is the sequel to a fun buddy comedy from a few years previously; a film entitled "Stakeout", and, if like me, you use minimal effort to read into where the brainstorming started in order to come up with such a title for this second film, you'll probably deduce that a third entry would've read something like: "YET Another Stakeout". Such a title, albeit hypothetical to a film that does not exist, conjures up a sense of the laborious; of the necessary although undesirable, and therein we deduce the gradual arc of the nature of both where these films MAY have gone, and where we're at with this particular entry. At the core of it is this comedic black hole is a threesome consisting of: Rosie O'Donnell; Emile Estevez and Richard Dreyfuss. Veterans of the first Stakeout film will identify two of the said three, Estevez and Dreyfuss, who respectively played police officers Bill Reimers and Chris Lecce. Veterans will also recall how well they combined in the middle of a tale which very gradually built into a menacing reality as Dreyfuss' character underwent a few changes in regards to his attitudes towards women and the true extent of their actual case blew wide open. These three are called upon to watch over a specific house in an easy-on-the-eye locale in the American city of Seattle; the reason being that it is home to a missing young woman named Luella Delano (Moriarty), whose testimony to an ugly recent incident involving innocents and police officers in Las Vegas caught up in a killing spree is paramount in nailing some crooks. In the meantime, however, the residence houses her parents: Dennis Farina's Brian O'Hara and his wife Pam (Strassman). The set up is simple: if she turns up at her family home, then the police have her and those who instigated the aforementioned Nevada chaos go down. But all of this is largely irrelevant for the duration of the film, as our leads slot into a facade of being the new next door neighbours and begin to engage in a series of wacky encounters built purely on the fact O'Donnell has brought her dog along with her and that Dreyfuss is a little miffed at being framed as his co-workers' husband/son as cover. There is a moment where the pseudo family are invited over for dinner, in what should be a centrepiece of comedy running on binary opposition and falsified stories (from both sides) as the O'Hara's try to cover up their daughter's situation and our leads disguise their policing backgrounds. But it runs aground; it doesn't get going. It begins to rely on that sharp pain one gets in the head when one devours ice cream too quickly. Depressingly, the film goes on to undo all of the good work from the first. Gone are the lessons Dreyfuss learnt, his relationship with Madeleine Stowe's Maria character, of whom was central to the stakeout in the first, is on the brink of terminating and Dreyfuss comes across as all of a sudden obnoxious and unlikeable. Gone too is any sort of rapport between the leads, with the majority of it just three people in a room shouting at each other. Where things worked in the first film, things collapse two-fold here; the sense that these people are at all qualified police officers worthy of the job they're on is suddenly all-but-lost, while the producer's decision to throw in O'Donnell reeks of a panic whereby going bigger and "better" is suddenly the solution to a problem that never existed. If ever there was an opportunity for a film of this ilk to drive forward with drama and heightened tension, it would be in a situation whereby the restricted view of an area we're aware the importance of is at the forefront of proceedings. In this scenario, a sense of cinema relies on facial expressions; "the image" and, if anything, a LACK of dialogue so as to not distract from the ensuing drama. One's mind boggles at a certain scene whereby Estevez charts the bathroom habits of his newly acquired targets, talking to himself in the process and using specific buzzwords more broadly linked to these excretal activities. It is quite incredible that a fully grown adult was even responsible for the construction of the sequence. And so, the film is a rank failure; one of those rare instances whereby the psychopath who pops up at the end to kill everyone actually gets our vote of approval to just do away with everyone. 2007 German film "The Lives of Others" was a pinnacle of sorts in its depiction of this clandestine world of observing and reporting; of swimming through the trouble of a delicate scenario; of getting under the skin and into the heads of those directly involved in both the observer and the observed. Here, Another Stakeout is the playground humour-ridden mess taking a premise not too dissimilar to the above and turning it into a recipe for unfunny chaos.

    For a fluffy, middle-tier, buddy-cop action comedy. This movie is great. The comedy is truly funny, Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez work perfectly together and the story-line is just enough to keep you in your seat. Unfortunately, Rosie O'Donnell doesn't add much to it but you can't have a sequel without adding a character or it's just the same movie all over again. Besides his stature, Richard Dreyfuss is a damn good portrayer of a cop in a comedy. His mannerisms, his comedic timing, all the aspects required for the role seem to come easy to him but he's just too small a man to be throwing punches at guys twice his size in height and in girth. Unfortunate really, although I'm pretty sure he'd rather be remembered for his dramatic works anyhow... Basically, this is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a sequel to the original. A slightly less enjoyable effort with the same comedic buddy-cop pairing with the same adequate but not ground-breaking story-line. Lots of fun if you're not expecting anything you haven't seen before. But that's just my two scents. ;)

    A dramatic murder-for-hire, quickly followed by a Keatonesque cops-and-robbers sequence introduce detectives Chris (Dreyfuss) a pathetic tough guy unable to commit to marriage and Bill (Estevez) the sidekick who is really a whole lot more emotionally secure. Much of the shtick is what makes this movie. Assistant D.A. Gina (Rosie O') is a lonely girl with a big job who really just wants to be a housewife entertaining friends. Rosie never breaks character, and there are moments her comedic timing has me rewinding a scene just to enjoy it again. Casting was great, with a fabulous ensemble of very good players, not one of them wasted. Director John Badham did well with Jim Kouf's memorable lines and I'd like to see them all do something else together...how about ANOTHER stakeout? Hey; third times a charm, right? Give this movie three views, and you'll find yourself getting your friends to watch it, too.

    I've not seen the original movie so I don't know how this sequel compares in comparison, but on it's own merits, 'Another Stakeout' isn't too bad and actually quite enjoyable, despite Rosie O'Donnell getting on my nerves throughout. Richard Dreyfuss & Emilio Estevez play DET.Chris Leece & DET.Bill Reimers respectively and are joined by 'comic-relief' Assistant D.A Gina Garrett played by the universally annoying Rosie O'Donnell along with her Rottweiller pet dog as all three are staking out a lakeside home on a remote Island, where a Mafia trial witness is supposed to be going to, so as cover they pretend to be Husband,Wife & son with 'hilarious' results.... The comedy is absolutely dire and does jar with the occasional bouts of violence. co-starring Dennis Farina & Miguel Ferrer all in all not a great film by any means but worth watching if you've nothing better to do *** out of *****

    This movie was so bad! Even fast forwarding I couldn't get through it fast enough, in 15 minute segments. HELP! The first Stakeout was fair at best, at least I watched it all the way through, but still a waste of time. An academy award winner like Richard Dreyfuss (Goodbye Girl), and a superb actor Emilio Estevez (The Breakfast Club & Judgment Night), and Rosie O'Donnell (who knows, who cares), trying to be funny, didn't work. However for the two male greats, this movie was so below them, why did they do it? Yes, it's probably hard to really know what a movie will be like before doing it, but once was enough with this movie. It was just another flopped squeal. Smart Actors like Richard Dreyfuss, and Emilio Estevez should have known better. Now they have to live with this one on their resumes'. Oh well glad it's not mine. Don't waste your time, get out Close Encounters, or Judgment Night, if you are looking for real entertainment.

    What's not to love? Dreyfuss, Estevez and O'Donnell all in prime comedic form, taking the buddy cop genre to a whole new level. Rosie paved the way for the likes of Joe Pesci and Chris Rock as being the 3rd or 4th wheel in that "other" (inferior) buddy cop series. And with classic lines like, "Cover me, I'm taking a bath.", this is truly film-making at its finest. Dreyfuss might be better remembered for roles in movies such as Close Encounters, Jaws and What About Bob, this is the role that truly defines him as an actor, a comedian and as an American. Estevez is great in sequels, as Young Guns II, D2: The Mighty Ducks and Another Stakeout are all the superior movie in the series they are in. And it was on the heels of this great performance that he hosted one of the funniest Saturday Night Lives I've ever seen. I believe that this was the apex of Rosie's acting career. After roles in A League of their Own and Sleepless in Seattle, I didn't think she could do any more... but I was wrong, she had enough in her tank for one more amazing performance before her career tail-spinned into obscure talk shows and publicized beefs with Donald Trump. The writing, directing and acting in this movie are all superb, and I was shocked that this movie wasn't nominated for any academy awards! If you haven't seen this movie, rent it today... it will make you laugh, cry (from laughing), and all the emotions in between!

    What a hidden treasure this movie is! Quite possibly the best sequel ever, though that MIGHT be a toss-up with Godfather 2. Richard Dreyfus is always a solid actor, but his work here really deserved an Oscar. Emelio Estevez might be best known for being Charlie Sheen's sane brother, but check out this movie and you'll be a life long Estevez fan, like I am. Of course, it goes without saying that this is the movie that made Rosie O'Donnell. Before this film, she was just a bit player. A stand-up comedienne. But this is where she made her mark. Even Donald Trump would agree that she's genius in this near-masterpiece of a movie.

A slightly less enjoyable effort with the same comedic buddy-cop pairing with the same adequate but not ground-breaking story-line. Lots of fun if you're not expecting anything you haven't seen before. But that's just my two scents. ;)

    A dramatic murder-for-hire, quickly followed by a Keatonesque cops-and-robbers sequence introduce detectives Chris (Dreyfuss) a pathetic tough guy unable to commit to marriage and Bill (Estevez) the sidekick who is really a whole lot more emotionally secure. Much of the shtick is what makes this movie. Assistant D.A. Gina (Rosie O') is a lonely girl with a big job who really just wants to be a housewife entertaining friends. Rosie never breaks character, and there are moments her comedic timing has me rewinding a scene just to enjoy it again. Casting was great, with a fabulous ensemble of very good players, not one of them wasted. Director John Badham did well with Jim Kouf's memorable lines and I'd like to see them all do something else together...how about ANOTHER stakeout? Hey; third times a charm, right? Give this movie three views, and you'll find yourself getting your friends to watch it, too.

    I've not seen the original movie so I don't know how this sequel compares in comparison, but on it's own merits, 'Another Stakeout' isn't too bad and actually quite enjoyable, despite Rosie O'Donnell getting on my nerves throughout. Richard Dreyfuss & Emilio Estevez play DET.Chris Leece & DET.Bill Reimers respectively and are joined by 'comic-relief' Assistant D.A Gina Garrett played by the universally annoying Rosie O'Donnell along with her Rottweiller pet dog as all three are staking out a lakeside home on a remote Island, where a Mafia trial witness is supposed to be going to, so as cover they pretend to be Husband,Wife & son with 'hilarious' results.... The comedy is absolutely dire and does jar with the occasional bouts of violence. co-starring Dennis Farina & Miguel Ferrer all in all not a great film by any means but worth watching if you've nothing better to do *** out of *****

    This movie was so bad! Even fast forwarding I couldn't get through it fast enough, in 15 minute segments. HELP! The first Stakeout was fair at best, at least I watched it all the way through, but still a waste of time. An academy award winner like Richard Dreyfuss (Goodbye Girl), and a superb actor Emilio Estevez (The Breakfast Club & Judgment Night), and Rosie O'Donnell (who knows, who cares), trying to be funny, didn't work. However for the two male greats, this movie was so below them, why did they do it? Yes, it's probably hard to really know what a movie will be like before doing it, but once was enough with this movie. It was just another flopped squeal. Smart Actors like Richard Dreyfuss, and Emilio Estevez should have known better. Now they have to live with this one on their resumes'. Oh well glad it's not mine. Don't waste your time, get out Close Encounters, or Judgment Night, if you are looking for real entertainment.

    What's not to love? Dreyfuss, Estevez and O'Donnell all in prime comedic form, taking the buddy cop genre to a whole new level. Rosie paved the way for the likes of Joe Pesci and Chris Rock as being the 3rd or 4th wheel in that "other" (inferior) buddy cop series. And with classic lines like, "Cover me, I'm taking a bath.", this is truly film-making at its finest. Dreyfuss might be better remembered for roles in movies such as Close Encounters, Jaws and What About Bob, this is the role that truly defines him as an actor, a comedian and as an American. Estevez is great in sequels, as Young Guns II, D2: The Mighty Ducks and Another Stakeout are all the superior movie in the series they are in. And it was on the heels of this great performance that he hosted one of the funniest Saturday Night Lives I've ever seen. I believe that this was the apex of Rosie's acting career. After roles in A League of their Own and Sleepless in Seattle, I didn't think she could do any more... but I was wrong, she had enough in her tank for one more amazing performance before her career tail-spinned into obscure talk shows and publicized beefs with Donald Trump. The writing, directing and acting in this movie are all superb, and I was shocked that this movie wasn't nominated for any academy awards! If you haven't seen this movie, rent it today... it will make you laugh, cry (from laughing), and all the emotions in between!

    What a hidden treasure this movie is! Quite possibly the best sequel ever, though that MIGHT be a toss-up with Godfather 2. Richard Dreyfus is always a solid actor, but his work here really deserved an Oscar. Emelio Estevez might be best known for being Charlie Sheen's sane brother, but check out this movie and you'll be a life long Estevez fan, like I am. Of course, it goes without saying that this is the movie that made Rosie O'Donnell. Before this film, she was just a bit player. A stand-up comedienne. But this is where she made her mark. Even Donald Trump would agree that she's genius in this near-masterpiece of a movie.

    first off I thought the movie was very funny , Emilio Estevez once again is very good,, Richard Dreyfus was OK,, I liked Miguel Ferrer's part as the hit-man assigned to the case. Rosie o donell on the other hand I just had to tune out, boy she can really get annoying. Dennis Farina on the other hand was very fun to watch , and had some good one liners to boot.. the plot isn't that bad,, state has to make a case,, the main witness is almost blown to pieces and proceeds to hideout somewhere far away,, but not far enough that our bad guys can't find her without some help.. some of the movie has flaws sure,, but I think mainly that it was made for laughs, and not so much plot points or stuff like that,, if there was a diff leading lady other than Rosie I would have rated it higher for sure.

    Six years after the first "Stakeout" (1987), cameras catch detectives Richard Dreyfuss (as Chris Lecce) and Emilio Estevez (as Bill Reimers) on another mission. It's nowhere near as good as the first. The format is similar. We begin with an action-packed opening. In Las Vegas, mobsters want to kill Cathy Moriarty (as Luella "Lu" Delano) because she's going to testify against them. This leads to the explosion of what appears to be a small town. Police search the rubble, but can't find Ms. Moriarty... They think the missing woman is going to contact a couple - Dennis Farina and Marcia Strassman (as Brian and Pam O'Hara) - so Mr. Dreyfuss and Mr. Estevez are recruited to pose as neighbors... Madeline Stowe (as Maria), from the first film, appears only sporadically and her chemistry with Dreyfuss is gone. The crime and criminals being investigated are confusing. To make the ruse more realistic, assistant district attorney Rosie O'Donnell (as Gina Garrett) is added to the mix. Accompanied by her rottweiler "Archie", Ms. O'Donnell pretends to be Dreyfuss' second wife and Estevez' step-mother. It's a funny situation, providing this sequel with a little freshness. Otherwise, the story is stale. ***** Another Stakeout (7/23/93) John Badham ~ Richard Dreyfuss, Emilio Estevez, Rosie O'Donnell, Dennis Farina

    "Another Stakeout", sequel of 1987's hit "Stakeout", has Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez playing pranksters cops Chris and Bill once again and doing another stakeout. But this time their mission of finding a mob witness (Cathy Moriarty) who might be hiding at the house of some important people, includes a new partner: an attorney (Rosie O'Donnell) who'll be commanding the situation for their despair, who'll have to pretend to be a real nice family while spying on their neighbors. Almost needless to say this is a completely inferior sequel to its exciting predecessor but still a good movie. "Stakeout" was great because it was darker, very tense, and the jokes and humored situations were dead on. It's intriguing that the villains there (two runaway convicts) were far more terrifying than the gangster, the false prosecutor and the sniper (Miguel Ferrer) altogether in this version. I think people at Disney only read the reviews that focused on how terrific the humor were in there, and decided to wipe any traces of violence only focusing on the funny side of the story. What we have here is a good comedy filled with laughter, and tiny doses of action, shots and explosions, relatively interesting, never so thrilling. Chris's marital problems with Maria (played by an uncredited Madeleine Stowe, also from the 1st movie), the priceless jokes on Bill's mustache and the dinner made for the neighbors are part of its warming and hysterical moments. The trio definitely has good chemistry. It should be a little more fast-paced when it comes to action, and trimmed down with the humored bits. It's very simple to follow yet when they try to complicate the plot they end up creating a strange plot hole towards its conclusion. But that's OK. I guess...Anyway, lots of fun but a little disappointing, and yes, I have to say that again, because the first one is awesome. 8/10

    I have this idea of police stakeouts being tiring, laborious things; endless hours, even days, of waiting and waiting for the slightest thing which may not even be of any necessity. I imagine a figure at the forefront of these investigations of immense patience, perhaps a rough but almost always methodical looking individual with the ability to sit and stare; to sit and watch; to ride the storm of sometimes absolutely nothing at all if it means wading out of the other end with something that'll help in the long run. Alas, 1993's Another Stakeout seems to think otherwise; an often loud, often brash and almost constantly unfunny movie dealing with the above like a Looney Tunes cartoon would the issue of hunting rabbits. The film is the sequel to a fun buddy comedy from a few years previously; a film entitled "Stakeout", and, if like me, you use minimal effort to read into where the brainstorming started in order to come up with such a title for this second film, you'll probably deduce that a third entry would've read something like: "YET Another Stakeout". Such a title, albeit hypothetical to a film that does not exist, conjures up a sense of the laborious; of the necessary although undesirable, and therein we deduce the gradual arc of the nature of both where these films MAY have gone, and where we're at with this particular entry. At the core of it is this comedic black hole is a threesome consisting of: Rosie O'Donnell; Emile Estevez and Richard Dreyfuss. Veterans of the first Stakeout film will identify two of the said three, Estevez and Dreyfuss, who respectively played police officers Bill Reimers and Chris Lecce. Veterans will also recall how well they combined in the middle of a tale which very gradually built into a menacing reality as Dreyfuss' character underwent a few changes in regards to his attitudes towards women and the true extent of their actual case blew wide open. These three are called upon to watch over a specific house in an easy-on-the-eye locale in the American city of Seattle; the reason being that it is home to a missing young woman named Luella Delano (Moriarty), whose testimony to an ugly recent incident involving innocents and police officers in Las Vegas caught up in a killing spree is paramount in nailing some crooks. In the meantime, however, the residence houses her parents: Dennis Farina's Brian O'Hara and his wife Pam (Strassman). The set up is simple: if she turns up at her family home, then the police have her and those who instigated the aforementioned Nevada chaos go down. But all of this is largely irrelevant for the duration of the film, as our leads slot into a facade of being the new next door neighbours and begin to engage in a series of wacky encounters built purely on the fact O'Donnell has brought her dog along with her and that Dreyfuss is a little miffed at being framed as his co-workers' husband/son as cover. There is a moment where the pseudo family are invited over for dinner, in what should be a centrepiece of comedy running on binary opposition and falsified stories (from both sides) as the O'Hara's try to cover up their daughter's situation and our leads disguise their policing backgrounds. But it runs aground; it doesn't get going. It begins to rely on that sharp pain one gets in the head when one devours ice cream too quickly. Depressingly, the film goes on to undo all of the good work from the first. Gone are the lessons Dreyfuss learnt, his relationship with Madeleine Stowe's Maria character, of whom was central to the stakeout in the first, is on the brink of terminating and Dreyfuss comes across as all of a sudden obnoxious and unlikeable. Gone too is any sort of rapport between the leads, with the majority of it just three people in a room shouting at each other. Where things worked in the first film, things collapse two-fold here; the sense that these people are at all qualified police officers worthy of the job they're on is suddenly all-but-lost, while the producer's decision to throw in O'Donnell reeks of a panic whereby going bigger and "better" is suddenly the solution to a problem that never existed. If ever there was an opportunity for a film of this ilk to drive forward with drama and heightened tension, it would be in a situation whereby the restricted view of an area we're aware the importance of is at the forefront of proceedings. In this scenario, a sense of cinema relies on facial expressions; "the image" and, if anything, a LACK of dialogue so as to not distract from the ensuing drama. One's mind boggles at a certain scene whereby Estevez charts the bathroom habits of his newly acquired targets, talking to himself in the process and using specific buzzwords more broadly linked to these excretal activities. It is quite incredible that a fully grown adult was even responsible for the construction of the sequence. And so, the film is a rank failure; one of those rare instances whereby the psychopath who pops up at the end to kill everyone actually gets our vote of approval to just do away with everyone. 2007 German film "The Lives of Others" was a pinnacle of sorts in its depiction of this clandestine world of observing and reporting; of swimming through the trouble of a delicate scenario; of getting under the skin and into the heads of those directly involved in both the observer and the observed. Here, Another Stakeout is the playground humour-ridden mess taking a premise not too dissimilar to the above and turning it into a recipe for unfunny chaos.

    For a fluffy, middle-tier, buddy-cop action comedy. This movie is great. The comedy is truly funny, Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez work perfectly together and the story-line is just enough to keep you in your seat. Unfortunately, Rosie O'Donnell doesn't add much to it but you can't have a sequel without adding a character or it's just the same movie all over again. Besides his stature, Richard Dreyfuss is a damn good portrayer of a cop in a comedy. His mannerisms, his comedic timing, all the aspects required for the role seem to come easy to him but he's just too small a man to be throwing punches at guys twice his size in height and in girth. Unfortunate really, although I'm pretty sure he'd rather be remembered for his dramatic works anyhow... Basically, this is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a sequel to the original. A slightly less enjoyable effort with the same comedic buddy-cop pairing with the same adequate but not ground-breaking story-line. Lots of fun if you're not expecting anything you haven't seen before. But that's just my two scents. ;)

The film is the sequel to a fun buddy comedy from a few years previously; a film entitled "Stakeout", and, if like me, you use minimal effort to read into where the brainstorming started in order to come up with such a title for this second film, you'll probably deduce that a third entry would've read something like: "YET Another Stakeout". Such a title, albeit hypothetical to a film that does not exist, conjures up a sense of the laborious; of the necessary although undesirable, and therein we deduce the gradual arc of the nature of both where these films MAY have gone, and where we're at with this particular entry. At the core of it is this comedic black hole is a threesome consisting of: Rosie O'Donnell; Emile Estevez and Richard Dreyfuss. Veterans of the first Stakeout film will identify two of the said three, Estevez and Dreyfuss, who respectively played police officers Bill Reimers and Chris Lecce. Veterans will also recall how well they combined in the middle of a tale which very gradually built into a menacing reality as Dreyfuss' character underwent a few changes in regards to his attitudes towards women and the true extent of their actual case blew wide open. These three are called upon to watch over a specific house in an easy-on-the-eye locale in the American city of Seattle; the reason being that it is home to a missing young woman named Luella Delano (Moriarty), whose testimony to an ugly recent incident involving innocents and police officers in Las Vegas caught up in a killing spree is paramount in nailing some crooks. In the meantime, however, the residence houses her parents: Dennis Farina's Brian O'Hara and his wife Pam (Strassman). The set up is simple: if she turns up at her family home, then the police have her and those who instigated the aforementioned Nevada chaos go down. But all of this is largely irrelevant for the duration of the film, as our leads slot into a facade of being the new next door neighbours and begin to engage in a series of wacky encounters built purely on the fact O'Donnell has brought her dog along with her and that Dreyfuss is a little miffed at being framed as his co-workers' husband/son as cover. There is a moment where the pseudo family are invited over for dinner, in what should be a centrepiece of comedy running on binary opposition and falsified stories (from both sides) as the O'Hara's try to cover up their daughter's situation and our leads disguise their policing backgrounds. But it runs aground; it doesn't get going. It begins to rely on that sharp pain one gets in the head when one devours ice cream too quickly. Depressingly, the film goes on to undo all of the good work from the first. Gone are the lessons Dreyfuss learnt, his relationship with Madeleine Stowe's Maria character, of whom was central to the stakeout in the first, is on the brink of terminating and Dreyfuss comes across as all of a sudden obnoxious and unlikeable. Gone too is any sort of rapport between the leads, with the majority of it just three people in a room shouting at each other. Where things worked in the first film, things collapse two-fold here; the sense that these people are at all qualified police officers worthy of the job they're on is suddenly all-but-lost, while the producer's decision to throw in O'Donnell reeks of a panic whereby going bigger and "better" is suddenly the solution to a problem that never existed. If ever there was an opportunity for a film of this ilk to drive forward with drama and heightened tension, it would be in a situation whereby the restricted view of an area we're aware the importance of is at the forefront of proceedings. In this scenario, a sense of cinema relies on facial expressions; "the image" and, if anything, a LACK of dialogue so as to not distract from the ensuing drama. One's mind boggles at a certain scene whereby Estevez charts the bathroom habits of his newly acquired targets, talking to himself in the process and using specific buzzwords more broadly linked to these excretal activities. It is quite incredible that a fully grown adult was even responsible for the construction of the sequence. And so, the film is a rank failure; one of those rare instances whereby the psychopath who pops up at the end to kill everyone actually gets our vote of approval to just do away with everyone. 2007 German film "The Lives of Others" was a pinnacle of sorts in its depiction of this clandestine world of observing and reporting; of swimming through the trouble of a delicate scenario; of getting under the skin and into the heads of those directly involved in both the observer and the observed. Here, Another Stakeout is the playground humour-ridden mess taking a premise not too dissimilar to the above and turning it into a recipe for unfunny chaos.

    For a fluffy, middle-tier, buddy-cop action comedy. This movie is great. The comedy is truly funny, Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez work perfectly together and the story-line is just enough to keep you in your seat. Unfortunately, Rosie O'Donnell doesn't add much to it but you can't have a sequel without adding a character or it's just the same movie all over again. Besides his stature, Richard Dreyfuss is a damn good portrayer of a cop in a comedy. His mannerisms, his comedic timing, all the aspects required for the role seem to come easy to him but he's just too small a man to be throwing punches at guys twice his size in height and in girth. Unfortunate really, although I'm pretty sure he'd rather be remembered for his dramatic works anyhow... Basically, this is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a sequel to the original. A slightly less enjoyable effort with the same comedic buddy-cop pairing with the same adequate but not ground-breaking story-line. Lots of fun if you're not expecting anything you haven't seen before. But that's just my two scents. ;)

    A dramatic murder-for-hire, quickly followed by a Keatonesque cops-and-robbers sequence introduce detectives Chris (Dreyfuss) a pathetic tough guy unable to commit to marriage and Bill (Estevez) the sidekick who is really a whole lot more emotionally secure. Much of the shtick is what makes this movie. Assistant D.A. Gina (Rosie O') is a lonely girl with a big job who really just wants to be a housewife entertaining friends. Rosie never breaks character, and there are moments her comedic timing has me rewinding a scene just to enjoy it again. Casting was great, with a fabulous ensemble of very good players, not one of them wasted. Director John Badham did well with Jim Kouf's memorable lines and I'd like to see them all do something else together...how about ANOTHER stakeout? Hey; third times a charm, right? Give this movie three views, and you'll find yourself getting your friends to watch it, too.

    I've not seen the original movie so I don't know how this sequel compares in comparison, but on it's own merits, 'Another Stakeout' isn't too bad and actually quite enjoyable, despite Rosie O'Donnell getting on my nerves throughout. Richard Dreyfuss & Emilio Estevez play DET.Chris Leece & DET.Bill Reimers respectively and are joined by 'comic-relief' Assistant D.A Gina Garrett played by the universally annoying Rosie O'Donnell along with her Rottweiller pet dog as all three are staking out a lakeside home on a remote Island, where a Mafia trial witness is supposed to be going to, so as cover they pretend to be Husband,Wife & son with 'hilarious' results.... The comedy is absolutely dire and does jar with the occasional bouts of violence. co-starring Dennis Farina & Miguel Ferrer all in all not a great film by any means but worth watching if you've nothing better to do *** out of *****

    This movie was so bad! Even fast forwarding I couldn't get through it fast enough, in 15 minute segments. HELP! The first Stakeout was fair at best, at least I watched it all the way through, but still a waste of time. An academy award winner like Richard Dreyfuss (Goodbye Girl), and a superb actor Emilio Estevez (The Breakfast Club & Judgment Night), and Rosie O'Donnell (who knows, who cares), trying to be funny, didn't work. However for the two male greats, this movie was so below them, why did they do it? Yes, it's probably hard to really know what a movie will be like before doing it, but once was enough with this movie. It was just another flopped squeal. Smart Actors like Richard Dreyfuss, and Emilio Estevez should have known better. Now they have to live with this one on their resumes'. Oh well glad it's not mine. Don't waste your time, get out Close Encounters, or Judgment Night, if you are looking for real entertainment.

    What's not to love? Dreyfuss, Estevez and O'Donnell all in prime comedic form, taking the buddy cop genre to a whole new level. Rosie paved the way for the likes of Joe Pesci and Chris Rock as being the 3rd or 4th wheel in that "other" (inferior) buddy cop series. And with classic lines like, "Cover me, I'm taking a bath.", this is truly film-making at its finest. Dreyfuss might be better remembered for roles in movies such as Close Encounters, Jaws and What About Bob, this is the role that truly defines him as an actor, a comedian and as an American. Estevez is great in sequels, as Young Guns II, D2: The Mighty Ducks and Another Stakeout are all the superior movie in the series they are in. And it was on the heels of this great performance that he hosted one of the funniest Saturday Night Lives I've ever seen. I believe that this was the apex of Rosie's acting career. After roles in A League of their Own and Sleepless in Seattle, I didn't think she could do any more... but I was wrong, she had enough in her tank for one more amazing performance before her career tail-spinned into obscure talk shows and publicized beefs with Donald Trump. The writing, directing and acting in this movie are all superb, and I was shocked that this movie wasn't nominated for any academy awards! If you haven't seen this movie, rent it today... it will make you laugh, cry (from laughing), and all the emotions in between!

    What a hidden treasure this movie is! Quite possibly the best sequel ever, though that MIGHT be a toss-up with Godfather 2. Richard Dreyfus is always a solid actor, but his work here really deserved an Oscar. Emelio Estevez might be best known for being Charlie Sheen's sane brother, but check out this movie and you'll be a life long Estevez fan, like I am. Of course, it goes without saying that this is the movie that made Rosie O'Donnell. Before this film, she was just a bit player. A stand-up comedienne. But this is where she made her mark. Even Donald Trump would agree that she's genius in this near-masterpiece of a movie.

    first off I thought the movie was very funny , Emilio Estevez once again is very good,, Richard Dreyfus was OK,, I liked Miguel Ferrer's part as the hit-man assigned to the case. Rosie o donell on the other hand I just had to tune out, boy she can really get annoying. Dennis Farina on the other hand was very fun to watch , and had some good one liners to boot.. the plot isn't that bad,, state has to make a case,, the main witness is almost blown to pieces and proceeds to hideout somewhere far away,, but not far enough that our bad guys can't find her without some help.. some of the movie has flaws sure,, but I think mainly that it was made for laughs, and not so much plot points or stuff like that,, if there was a diff leading lady other than Rosie I would have rated it higher for sure.

    Six years after the first "Stakeout" (1987), cameras catch detectives Richard Dreyfuss (as Chris Lecce) and Emilio Estevez (as Bill Reimers) on another mission. It's nowhere near as good as the first. The format is similar. We begin with an action-packed opening. In Las Vegas, mobsters want to kill Cathy Moriarty (as Luella "Lu" Delano) because she's going to testify against them. This leads to the explosion of what appears to be a small town. Police search the rubble, but can't find Ms. Moriarty... They think the missing woman is going to contact a couple - Dennis Farina and Marcia Strassman (as Brian and Pam O'Hara) - so Mr. Dreyfuss and Mr. Estevez are recruited to pose as neighbors... Madeline Stowe (as Maria), from the first film, appears only sporadically and her chemistry with Dreyfuss is gone. The crime and criminals being investigated are confusing. To make the ruse more realistic, assistant district attorney Rosie O'Donnell (as Gina Garrett) is added to the mix. Accompanied by her rottweiler "Archie", Ms. O'Donnell pretends to be Dreyfuss' second wife and Estevez' step-mother. It's a funny situation, providing this sequel with a little freshness. Otherwise, the story is stale. ***** Another Stakeout (7/23/93) John Badham ~ Richard Dreyfuss, Emilio Estevez, Rosie O'Donnell, Dennis Farina

    "Another Stakeout", sequel of 1987's hit "Stakeout", has Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez playing pranksters cops Chris and Bill once again and doing another stakeout. But this time their mission of finding a mob witness (Cathy Moriarty) who might be hiding at the house of some important people, includes a new partner: an attorney (Rosie O'Donnell) who'll be commanding the situation for their despair, who'll have to pretend to be a real nice family while spying on their neighbors. Almost needless to say this is a completely inferior sequel to its exciting predecessor but still a good movie. "Stakeout" was great because it was darker, very tense, and the jokes and humored situations were dead on. It's intriguing that the villains there (two runaway convicts) were far more terrifying than the gangster, the false prosecutor and the sniper (Miguel Ferrer) altogether in this version. I think people at Disney only read the reviews that focused on how terrific the humor were in there, and decided to wipe any traces of violence only focusing on the funny side of the story. What we have here is a good comedy filled with laughter, and tiny doses of action, shots and explosions, relatively interesting, never so thrilling. Chris's marital problems with Maria (played by an uncredited Madeleine Stowe, also from the 1st movie), the priceless jokes on Bill's mustache and the dinner made for the neighbors are part of its warming and hysterical moments. The trio definitely has good chemistry. It should be a little more fast-paced when it comes to action, and trimmed down with the humored bits. It's very simple to follow yet when they try to complicate the plot they end up creating a strange plot hole towards its conclusion. But that's OK. I guess...Anyway, lots of fun but a little disappointing, and yes, I have to say that again, because the first one is awesome. 8/10

    I have this idea of police stakeouts being tiring, laborious things; endless hours, even days, of waiting and waiting for the slightest thing which may not even be of any necessity. I imagine a figure at the forefront of these investigations of immense patience, perhaps a rough but almost always methodical looking individual with the ability to sit and stare; to sit and watch; to ride the storm of sometimes absolutely nothing at all if it means wading out of the other end with something that'll help in the long run. Alas, 1993's Another Stakeout seems to think otherwise; an often loud, often brash and almost constantly unfunny movie dealing with the above like a Looney Tunes cartoon would the issue of hunting rabbits.
