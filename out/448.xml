 <sinopse>
  An American ambassador learns to his horror that his son is actually the literal Antichrist.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Robert and Katherine Thorn seem to have it all. They are happily married and he is the US Ambassador to Great Britain, but they want more than to have children. When Katharine has a stillborn child, Robert is approached by a priest at the hospital who suggests that they take a healthy newborn whose mother has just died in childbirth. Without telling his wife he agrees. After relocating to London, strange events - and the ominous warnings of a priest - lead him to believe that the child he took from that Italian hospital is evil incarnate.

    Gregory Peck & Lee Remick play Robert and Katharine Thorn, a U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain and his wife in this blockbuster hit supernatural thriller. Katharine has just suffered a miscarriage, and rather than tell her, he instead adopts an orphan baby made available to him by the hospital, and passes him off as their baby boy. Years later, strange and sinister occurrences start happening around the boy(named Damien), until Father Brennan( played by "Doctor Who" actor Patrick Troughton, who is excellent in his small but crucial role) tries to explain of Damien's true parentage, but Thorn rejects this as ravings. Others try to warn Mr. Thorn about the danger, until Robert is confronted by irrefutable proof of Damien's origins, but by then it could be too late... Intriguing but overheated thriller certainly is slickly made and watchable, but credibility is low, and story relies far too much on melodrama and shock value, rather than thoughtful horror drama.

    When you see that mind game that is made trough the whole movie and the effects that are left on you while watching it and it's made in 1976... I mean that this is one of the top movies I ever watched. Of course the acting is on top level as well and the plot is picked on a long shot. Little Damien was remarkable during his scenes and the scary parts are still scary after 37 years. I just regret that i couldn't watch it earlier because i think it would have even better effect on me than now. If you are looking for a movie that scares you, this is what you need to see. I have seen a lot of scary horror, psycho movies in my life and this movie is the top movie for that genre. It's just Richard Donner's masterpiece.

    As horror movies go, "The Omen" is one of the more meaningless ones with almost no intellectual or thematic appeal. Peck's character is so inclined not to heed what is told him that he virtually seals his fate and that of his wife, Lee Remick. He has been told to be saved by Christ. He doesn't listen the first time. All right. Write that off as being stubborn and haughty. But after learning about Damien, he still doesn't take this advice. Instead he wanders off doing needless detective work when he already has substantial information that warrants calling on the Holy Spirit. The plot has too many holes, such as Billie Whitelaw waltzing in to his house and taking over. Given the dark power's force that he has seen work against the first governess and his wife, you would think he might arm himself against contingencies, but he does not. Why, I'd like to know, were police so anxious to stop him at the end? I must have missed some critical plot point, or did I? There are some excellent horror movies out there, such as "Curse of the Demon", some of the Hammers, the old Universals, "White Zombie", Dr. X, and so on. In my opinion, "The Omen" is just average and doesn't come up to them. I think that it's missing some critical elements in the story. The acting, settings and direction here are adequate enough. I think it's the story where the weakness is.

    The moral dilemmas, the mounting tension, stoic Gregory Peck and Lee Remick coming to their own separate conclusions, the baboons, the Priest, the photographer revelation, the graveyard dogs, that freaking scary Nanny and our beloved Damian: the scariest kid on film as the Antichrist! The mythology needed little explanation and the acting took this horror to the highest level of suspension of disbelief. Director Richard Donner weaves it all together with a Carmina Burana -esque score . And yet the eternal question lingers "What do you know about my son"? How can you not consider what you would do faced with this horror scenario? That is why this is so horrifyingly personal and a must watch!

    The Omen is a supernatural thriller/Satanist horror film directed Richard Donner of Superman and Lethal Weapon fame and stars Gregory Peck, David Warner and Patrick "The Second Doctor" Troughton. Its central premise surrounds the biblical myth about the birth of the Antichrist and the inevitable doom which will it bring. Add to that creepy and effective score, great performances, good script and rock solid direction and you will get a horror classic. Like The Shining, Omen relies on build up, suspense and performances to bring the scares rather than go for the gore and jump scares. Plus, you can never go wrong when you cast classic Hollywood actors as your leads in horror movies. Gregory Peck is absolutely brilliant as the lead and gives his performance much intensity. This could have been even cooler if they could have gotten Jimmy Stewart or Henry Fonda for the part. I just love when these old-school actors appear in movies where people suffer gory deaths and swear a lot. The rest of the cast is great. David Warner gives his usual powerhouse performance, Patrick Troughton is great but sadly he is in it for few scenes and Billie Whitelaw is wonderfully creepy as the satanist governess. The direction by Richard Donner is as rock solid as you might expect from him. He knows where to put the camera and understands that characters and atmosphere are more essential to good horror rather than silly jump scares and gore. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is absolutely phenomenal and sends the chills up my spine. Without it, The Omen wouldn't be half as creepy and unsettling as it is. The only real faults with the film, lies in the script. There are few dodgy moments that would make some people shout at the screen. How in the hell, the parents couldn't tell that their governess was up for no good. Nearly the whole first 30 or 40 minutes the parents acted fairly stupid and because the plot said so. But after that, it got much better and felt much more natural. But aside from some inconsistencies, The Omen is absolutely fantastic. The Omen is a must see for any horror fans. It's as good as mainstream horror will ever get. And watching the ultimate good guy Gregory Peck in a satanic horror film is always nice. If you are looking for boobs, booze and teenagers partying, you won't find it here.

    The one real reason I wanted to watch this is because I saw the fourth movie due to a debate on message boards and after that movie left a bad taste in my mouth I wanted to watch the original just so I can't associate "The Omen" with bad acting, laugh-out-loud hilarity and absent suspense. I honestly though it was decent. I'm sure people may know of this plot. An ambassador finds out his adopted child is really the offspring of Satan (or the Antichrist - however you want to word it - both have a nice ring to it). People around are dying in freak accidents. A photographer who helps this ambassador helps him because photographs have predicted both the freak accidents and he took a picture of himself that shows him getting decapitated. This movie is pretty good. I don't really care much for the concept though (it's because I'm an atheist - I haven't been a Christian for about 5 years). The directing is very suspenseful, but a complaint about that is that the suspenseful scenes are a little too few, but it was enough to keep me watching until the very end. I might watch the other 2, but if I can watch the fourth one then I'm pretty sure I've watched the worst Omen movie.

    A film that polarises opinion irrespective of its religious incantations, some unimpressed by its comic-book style hokum, others like myself willing to be immersed in the tale of the anti-Christ (Stephens) born into a wealthy American family living abroad, setting a course for Satan's second coming. Peck, playing American Ambassador to the UK and his wife Lee Remick lose their child during birth, but with the assistance of corrupt clergyman Martin Benson, Peck manages to procure a replacement child of shady origins. In the history of bad decisions, this is right up there with the most catastrophic, as the baby Damien wields his unassuming temperament against those conspiring to subdue the rise of the devil on earth. David Warner co-stars as the intrepid photo journalist who's bitten off more than he can chew investigating a series of strange events surrounding the family, former "Doctor Who" incarnation Patrick Troughton has a memorable supporting role as a doom-saying priest, and other notable roles are played with aplomb by Martin Benson, Leo McKern, Bruce Boa, John Stride and Anthony Nicholls to name a few. Jack's daughter, Holly Palance has a great cameo in one of the film's many penultimate moments, early on at the birthday party. Billie Whitelaw's inspired performance as the sinister house-keeper is perhaps the template that would be emulated many times over (e.g. Dimitra Arliss in "Bless the Child" for example), and in my opinion, the real sleeper in this film. Her measured performance is one of the key aspects that elevates this tale beyond the comic-book hokum for which some reviewers hold contempt, notwithstanding the fuzzy logic on the religious overtures, which to be honest, who really cares. It's only a movie, and a chilling one at that, director Richard Donner immortalising himself with this effort, which in my opinion is easily in the top ten horror films ever made for its imagery, atmosphere, visual effects and of course, "Ave Satani" soundtrack.

    As a devout Horror fan who fancies himself a Horror freak, I've wanted to familiarize myself with some of the genre's classics. The process included watching the full series of Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th and Children of the Corn, and it was only a matter of time before my "travels" took me to The Omen. While watching the film (as well as writing this review) I've made sure to bear in mind that this was a film from the late 70's, when several aspects of the Cinema field have not yet developed, or at least not yet fully matured. For instance, what I've found to be most blunt, has been the acting. Throughout the film I haven't been able to not notice that the actors appear to be acting for the sake of acting, rather than to try and appear realistic and assist suspense of disbelief (very much like actors in musicals and plays in the theatre, who act like actors in a play or musical rather than like "real" characters). Furthermore, the "struggle" scenes (weather with other characters or beasts) all appear very unrealistic. And lastly, little Harvey Stephens, while adorable and precious, simply failed to frighten me in any way... Much of that criticism is probably due to the time the film was screened, when the a woman hanging herself, a man having his head chopped of and the very thought of children being possessed by the devil were enough to startle, unnerve and even shock an audience. Add to that the fact that I happen to be Jewish and not Christian, and you might understand why The Omen didn't really leave such an impression on me. However, having said that, if I do take consideration of the time the film was screened, I can very well understand how groundbreaking and innovative it must have been, and how many spectators have probably been really frightened by it. The story and script were good, the poor lighting and visual effects were probably (yet again) fine for the 70's, and the ending probably had people on the edges of their seats. All in all, I'm afraid I've been born too late and am too young to be able to fully appreciate The Omen, one of the masterpieces of the genre. I consider it my personal loss. However, I've had a great time watching it, and I recommend it to anyone who's a Horror fan and/or a fan of late 70's cinema.

    Gregory Peck looks suitably concerned as it turns out that the baby he hastily adopted on the night of his own baby's death may be the son of the devil. Turns out the book of revelations details the second coming of the Antichrist or something, so it's an all out adventure for Peck and sidekick David Warner as they try to get to the bottom of the conspiracy. Good old Christian doctrine comes into play here as we've got the doubting (at first) Peck, who writes off Damien's behaviour as that of a normal five-year-old. As the proud father of my own little Damien, I have spent many an hour checking my kid's scalp for three sixes, especially after he's tried to put our budgie in a blender or destroyed a piece of furniture, but at least I haven't had a priest turning up at my door pleading for me to kill my own child. Also, I'm sure that when our babysitter killed herself it was just due to the brimstone tinged contents of our kid's nappy, rather than being compelled to swing from a rope by a persuasive dog. The first Omen film is rather good. It's filled with dread and there's some pretty good set pieces in there, plus when you've got decent actors like Peck and Warner playing it pretty straight that helps things too. It's still worth a watch after all these years, but sad to say any of the sequels don't really stand up to the original.

    An American ambassador (Gregory Peck) learns to his horror that his son (Harvey Stephens) is actually the literal Antichrist. Some people have compared this film to "The Exorcist", another Satanic film released around the same time. Others have compared it to the remake (which, good or bad, owes its existence to this film). I have no interest in doing either. The film stands on its own merits, with the solid cast of Gregory Peck (a legend) and Lee Remick. David Warner, perhaps the last great horror actor, plays a significantly large role in the second half. And even the minor characters -- especially Father Brennan -- carry the picture. This is not to mention the director, Mr. Donner, whose carry only went up from here. What sells this film is the atmosphere. Jerry Goldsmith has an incredible score (those Latin chants are key). And even after going more than a decade without seeing the picture, the death scenes stood starkly in my mind as fresh as if they had just happened. This is one of the horror greats.

The story and script were good, the poor lighting and visual effects were probably (yet again) fine for the 70's, and the ending probably had people on the edges of their seats. All in all, I'm afraid I've been born too late and am too young to be able to fully appreciate The Omen, one of the masterpieces of the genre. I consider it my personal loss. However, I've had a great time watching it, and I recommend it to anyone who's a Horror fan and/or a fan of late 70's cinema.

    Gregory Peck looks suitably concerned as it turns out that the baby he hastily adopted on the night of his own baby's death may be the son of the devil. Turns out the book of revelations details the second coming of the Antichrist or something, so it's an all out adventure for Peck and sidekick David Warner as they try to get to the bottom of the conspiracy. Good old Christian doctrine comes into play here as we've got the doubting (at first) Peck, who writes off Damien's behaviour as that of a normal five-year-old. As the proud father of my own little Damien, I have spent many an hour checking my kid's scalp for three sixes, especially after he's tried to put our budgie in a blender or destroyed a piece of furniture, but at least I haven't had a priest turning up at my door pleading for me to kill my own child. Also, I'm sure that when our babysitter killed herself it was just due to the brimstone tinged contents of our kid's nappy, rather than being compelled to swing from a rope by a persuasive dog. The first Omen film is rather good. It's filled with dread and there's some pretty good set pieces in there, plus when you've got decent actors like Peck and Warner playing it pretty straight that helps things too. It's still worth a watch after all these years, but sad to say any of the sequels don't really stand up to the original.

    An American ambassador (Gregory Peck) learns to his horror that his son (Harvey Stephens) is actually the literal Antichrist. Some people have compared this film to "The Exorcist", another Satanic film released around the same time. Others have compared it to the remake (which, good or bad, owes its existence to this film). I have no interest in doing either. The film stands on its own merits, with the solid cast of Gregory Peck (a legend) and Lee Remick. David Warner, perhaps the last great horror actor, plays a significantly large role in the second half. And even the minor characters -- especially Father Brennan -- carry the picture. This is not to mention the director, Mr. Donner, whose carry only went up from here. What sells this film is the atmosphere. Jerry Goldsmith has an incredible score (those Latin chants are key). And even after going more than a decade without seeing the picture, the death scenes stood starkly in my mind as fresh as if they had just happened. This is one of the horror greats.

    Gregory Peck & Lee Remick play Robert and Katharine Thorn, a U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain and his wife in this blockbuster hit supernatural thriller. Katharine has just suffered a miscarriage, and rather than tell her, he instead adopts an orphan baby made available to him by the hospital, and passes him off as their baby boy. Years later, strange and sinister occurrences start happening around the boy(named Damien), until Father Brennan( played by "Doctor Who" actor Patrick Troughton, who is excellent in his small but crucial role) tries to explain of Damien's true parentage, but Thorn rejects this as ravings. Others try to warn Mr. Thorn about the danger, until Robert is confronted by irrefutable proof of Damien's origins, but by then it could be too late... Intriguing but overheated thriller certainly is slickly made and watchable, but credibility is low, and story relies far too much on melodrama and shock value, rather than thoughtful horror drama.

    When you see that mind game that is made trough the whole movie and the effects that are left on you while watching it and it's made in 1976... I mean that this is one of the top movies I ever watched. Of course the acting is on top level as well and the plot is picked on a long shot. Little Damien was remarkable during his scenes and the scary parts are still scary after 37 years. I just regret that i couldn't watch it earlier because i think it would have even better effect on me than now. If you are looking for a movie that scares you, this is what you need to see. I have seen a lot of scary horror, psycho movies in my life and this movie is the top movie for that genre. It's just Richard Donner's masterpiece.

    As horror movies go, "The Omen" is one of the more meaningless ones with almost no intellectual or thematic appeal. Peck's character is so inclined not to heed what is told him that he virtually seals his fate and that of his wife, Lee Remick. He has been told to be saved by Christ. He doesn't listen the first time. All right. Write that off as being stubborn and haughty. But after learning about Damien, he still doesn't take this advice. Instead he wanders off doing needless detective work when he already has substantial information that warrants calling on the Holy Spirit. The plot has too many holes, such as Billie Whitelaw waltzing in to his house and taking over. Given the dark power's force that he has seen work against the first governess and his wife, you would think he might arm himself against contingencies, but he does not. Why, I'd like to know, were police so anxious to stop him at the end? I must have missed some critical plot point, or did I? There are some excellent horror movies out there, such as "Curse of the Demon", some of the Hammers, the old Universals, "White Zombie", Dr. X, and so on. In my opinion, "The Omen" is just average and doesn't come up to them. I think that it's missing some critical elements in the story. The acting, settings and direction here are adequate enough. I think it's the story where the weakness is.

    The moral dilemmas, the mounting tension, stoic Gregory Peck and Lee Remick coming to their own separate conclusions, the baboons, the Priest, the photographer revelation, the graveyard dogs, that freaking scary Nanny and our beloved Damian: the scariest kid on film as the Antichrist! The mythology needed little explanation and the acting took this horror to the highest level of suspension of disbelief. Director Richard Donner weaves it all together with a Carmina Burana -esque score . And yet the eternal question lingers "What do you know about my son"? How can you not consider what you would do faced with this horror scenario? That is why this is so horrifyingly personal and a must watch!

    The Omen is a supernatural thriller/Satanist horror film directed Richard Donner of Superman and Lethal Weapon fame and stars Gregory Peck, David Warner and Patrick "The Second Doctor" Troughton. Its central premise surrounds the biblical myth about the birth of the Antichrist and the inevitable doom which will it bring. Add to that creepy and effective score, great performances, good script and rock solid direction and you will get a horror classic. Like The Shining, Omen relies on build up, suspense and performances to bring the scares rather than go for the gore and jump scares. Plus, you can never go wrong when you cast classic Hollywood actors as your leads in horror movies. Gregory Peck is absolutely brilliant as the lead and gives his performance much intensity. This could have been even cooler if they could have gotten Jimmy Stewart or Henry Fonda for the part. I just love when these old-school actors appear in movies where people suffer gory deaths and swear a lot. The rest of the cast is great. David Warner gives his usual powerhouse performance, Patrick Troughton is great but sadly he is in it for few scenes and Billie Whitelaw is wonderfully creepy as the satanist governess. The direction by Richard Donner is as rock solid as you might expect from him. He knows where to put the camera and understands that characters and atmosphere are more essential to good horror rather than silly jump scares and gore. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is absolutely phenomenal and sends the chills up my spine. Without it, The Omen wouldn't be half as creepy and unsettling as it is. The only real faults with the film, lies in the script. There are few dodgy moments that would make some people shout at the screen. How in the hell, the parents couldn't tell that their governess was up for no good. Nearly the whole first 30 or 40 minutes the parents acted fairly stupid and because the plot said so. But after that, it got much better and felt much more natural. But aside from some inconsistencies, The Omen is absolutely fantastic. The Omen is a must see for any horror fans. It's as good as mainstream horror will ever get. And watching the ultimate good guy Gregory Peck in a satanic horror film is always nice. If you are looking for boobs, booze and teenagers partying, you won't find it here.

    The one real reason I wanted to watch this is because I saw the fourth movie due to a debate on message boards and after that movie left a bad taste in my mouth I wanted to watch the original just so I can't associate "The Omen" with bad acting, laugh-out-loud hilarity and absent suspense. I honestly though it was decent. I'm sure people may know of this plot. An ambassador finds out his adopted child is really the offspring of Satan (or the Antichrist - however you want to word it - both have a nice ring to it). People around are dying in freak accidents. A photographer who helps this ambassador helps him because photographs have predicted both the freak accidents and he took a picture of himself that shows him getting decapitated. This movie is pretty good. I don't really care much for the concept though (it's because I'm an atheist - I haven't been a Christian for about 5 years). The directing is very suspenseful, but a complaint about that is that the suspenseful scenes are a little too few, but it was enough to keep me watching until the very end. I might watch the other 2, but if I can watch the fourth one then I'm pretty sure I've watched the worst Omen movie.

    A film that polarises opinion irrespective of its religious incantations, some unimpressed by its comic-book style hokum, others like myself willing to be immersed in the tale of the anti-Christ (Stephens) born into a wealthy American family living abroad, setting a course for Satan's second coming. Peck, playing American Ambassador to the UK and his wife Lee Remick lose their child during birth, but with the assistance of corrupt clergyman Martin Benson, Peck manages to procure a replacement child of shady origins. In the history of bad decisions, this is right up there with the most catastrophic, as the baby Damien wields his unassuming temperament against those conspiring to subdue the rise of the devil on earth. David Warner co-stars as the intrepid photo journalist who's bitten off more than he can chew investigating a series of strange events surrounding the family, former "Doctor Who" incarnation Patrick Troughton has a memorable supporting role as a doom-saying priest, and other notable roles are played with aplomb by Martin Benson, Leo McKern, Bruce Boa, John Stride and Anthony Nicholls to name a few. Jack's daughter, Holly Palance has a great cameo in one of the film's many penultimate moments, early on at the birthday party. Billie Whitelaw's inspired performance as the sinister house-keeper is perhaps the template that would be emulated many times over (e.g. Dimitra Arliss in "Bless the Child" for example), and in my opinion, the real sleeper in this film. Her measured performance is one of the key aspects that elevates this tale beyond the comic-book hokum for which some reviewers hold contempt, notwithstanding the fuzzy logic on the religious overtures, which to be honest, who really cares. It's only a movie, and a chilling one at that, director Richard Donner immortalising himself with this effort, which in my opinion is easily in the top ten horror films ever made for its imagery, atmosphere, visual effects and of course, "Ave Satani" soundtrack.

    As a devout Horror fan who fancies himself a Horror freak, I've wanted to familiarize myself with some of the genre's classics. The process included watching the full series of Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th and Children of the Corn, and it was only a matter of time before my "travels" took me to The Omen. While watching the film (as well as writing this review) I've made sure to bear in mind that this was a film from the late 70's, when several aspects of the Cinema field have not yet developed, or at least not yet fully matured. For instance, what I've found to be most blunt, has been the acting. Throughout the film I haven't been able to not notice that the actors appear to be acting for the sake of acting, rather than to try and appear realistic and assist suspense of disbelief (very much like actors in musicals and plays in the theatre, who act like actors in a play or musical rather than like "real" characters). Furthermore, the "struggle" scenes (weather with other characters or beasts) all appear very unrealistic. And lastly, little Harvey Stephens, while adorable and precious, simply failed to frighten me in any way... Much of that criticism is probably due to the time the film was screened, when the a woman hanging herself, a man having his head chopped of and the very thought of children being possessed by the devil were enough to startle, unnerve and even shock an audience. Add to that the fact that I happen to be Jewish and not Christian, and you might understand why The Omen didn't really leave such an impression on me. However, having said that, if I do take consideration of the time the film was screened, I can very well understand how groundbreaking and innovative it must have been, and how many spectators have probably been really frightened by it. The story and script were good, the poor lighting and visual effects were probably (yet again) fine for the 70's, and the ending probably had people on the edges of their seats. All in all, I'm afraid I've been born too late and am too young to be able to fully appreciate The Omen, one of the masterpieces of the genre. I consider it my personal loss. However, I've had a great time watching it, and I recommend it to anyone who's a Horror fan and/or a fan of late 70's cinema.

    As a devout Horror fan who fancies himself a Horror freak, I've wanted to familiarize myself with some of the genre's classics. The process included watching the full series of Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th and Children of the Corn, and it was only a matter of time before my "travels" took me to The Omen. While watching the film (as well as writing this review) I've made sure to bear in mind that this was a film from the late 70's, when several aspects of the Cinema field have not yet developed, or at least not yet fully matured. For instance, what I've found to be most blunt, has been the acting. Throughout the film I haven't been able to not notice that the actors appear to be acting for the sake of acting, rather than to try and appear realistic and assist suspense of disbelief (very much like actors in musicals and plays in the theatre, who act like actors in a play or musical rather than like "real" characters). Furthermore, the "struggle" scenes (weather with other characters or beasts) all appear very unrealistic. And lastly, little Harvey Stephens, while adorable and precious, simply failed to frighten me in any way... Much of that criticism is probably due to the time the film was screened, when the a woman hanging herself, a man having his head chopped of and the very thought of children being possessed by the devil were enough to startle, unnerve and even shock an audience. Add to that the fact that I happen to be Jewish and not Christian, and you might understand why The Omen didn't really leave such an impression on me. However, having said that, if I do take consideration of the time the film was screened, I can very well understand how groundbreaking and innovative it must have been, and how many spectators have probably been really frightened by it. The story and script were good, the poor lighting and visual effects were probably (yet again) fine for the 70's, and the ending probably had people on the edges of their seats. All in all, I'm afraid I've been born too late and am too young to be able to fully appreciate The Omen, one of the masterpieces of the genre. I consider it my personal loss. However, I've had a great time watching it, and I recommend it to anyone who's a Horror fan and/or a fan of late 70's cinema.

    Gregory Peck looks suitably concerned as it turns out that the baby he hastily adopted on the night of his own baby's death may be the son of the devil. Turns out the book of revelations details the second coming of the Antichrist or something, so it's an all out adventure for Peck and sidekick David Warner as they try to get to the bottom of the conspiracy. Good old Christian doctrine comes into play here as we've got the doubting (at first) Peck, who writes off Damien's behaviour as that of a normal five-year-old. As the proud father of my own little Damien, I have spent many an hour checking my kid's scalp for three sixes, especially after he's tried to put our budgie in a blender or destroyed a piece of furniture, but at least I haven't had a priest turning up at my door pleading for me to kill my own child. Also, I'm sure that when our babysitter killed herself it was just due to the brimstone tinged contents of our kid's nappy, rather than being compelled to swing from a rope by a persuasive dog. The first Omen film is rather good. It's filled with dread and there's some pretty good set pieces in there, plus when you've got decent actors like Peck and Warner playing it pretty straight that helps things too. It's still worth a watch after all these years, but sad to say any of the sequels don't really stand up to the original.

    An American ambassador (Gregory Peck) learns to his horror that his son (Harvey Stephens) is actually the literal Antichrist. Some people have compared this film to "The Exorcist", another Satanic film released around the same time. Others have compared it to the remake (which, good or bad, owes its existence to this film). I have no interest in doing either. The film stands on its own merits, with the solid cast of Gregory Peck (a legend) and Lee Remick. David Warner, perhaps the last great horror actor, plays a significantly large role in the second half. And even the minor characters -- especially Father Brennan -- carry the picture. This is not to mention the director, Mr. Donner, whose carry only went up from here. What sells this film is the atmosphere. Jerry Goldsmith has an incredible score (those Latin chants are key). And even after going more than a decade without seeing the picture, the death scenes stood starkly in my mind as fresh as if they had just happened. This is one of the horror greats.

    Gregory Peck & Lee Remick play Robert and Katharine Thorn, a U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain and his wife in this blockbuster hit supernatural thriller. Katharine has just suffered a miscarriage, and rather than tell her, he instead adopts an orphan baby made available to him by the hospital, and passes him off as their baby boy. Years later, strange and sinister occurrences start happening around the boy(named Damien), until Father Brennan( played by "Doctor Who" actor Patrick Troughton, who is excellent in his small but crucial role) tries to explain of Damien's true parentage, but Thorn rejects this as ravings. Others try to warn Mr. Thorn about the danger, until Robert is confronted by irrefutable proof of Damien's origins, but by then it could be too late... Intriguing but overheated thriller certainly is slickly made and watchable, but credibility is low, and story relies far too much on melodrama and shock value, rather than thoughtful horror drama.

    When you see that mind game that is made trough the whole movie and the effects that are left on you while watching it and it's made in 1976... I mean that this is one of the top movies I ever watched. Of course the acting is on top level as well and the plot is picked on a long shot. Little Damien was remarkable during his scenes and the scary parts are still scary after 37 years. I just regret that i couldn't watch it earlier because i think it would have even better effect on me than now. If you are looking for a movie that scares you, this is what you need to see. I have seen a lot of scary horror, psycho movies in my life and this movie is the top movie for that genre. It's just Richard Donner's masterpiece.

    As horror movies go, "The Omen" is one of the more meaningless ones with almost no intellectual or thematic appeal. Peck's character is so inclined not to heed what is told him that he virtually seals his fate and that of his wife, Lee Remick. He has been told to be saved by Christ. He doesn't listen the first time. All right. Write that off as being stubborn and haughty. But after learning about Damien, he still doesn't take this advice. Instead he wanders off doing needless detective work when he already has substantial information that warrants calling on the Holy Spirit. The plot has too many holes, such as Billie Whitelaw waltzing in to his house and taking over. Given the dark power's force that he has seen work against the first governess and his wife, you would think he might arm himself against contingencies, but he does not. Why, I'd like to know, were police so anxious to stop him at the end? I must have missed some critical plot point, or did I? There are some excellent horror movies out there, such as "Curse of the Demon", some of the Hammers, the old Universals, "White Zombie", Dr. X, and so on. In my opinion, "The Omen" is just average and doesn't come up to them. I think that it's missing some critical elements in the story. The acting, settings and direction here are adequate enough. I think it's the story where the weakness is.

    The moral dilemmas, the mounting tension, stoic Gregory Peck and Lee Remick coming to their own separate conclusions, the baboons, the Priest, the photographer revelation, the graveyard dogs, that freaking scary Nanny and our beloved Damian: the scariest kid on film as the Antichrist! The mythology needed little explanation and the acting took this horror to the highest level of suspension of disbelief. Director Richard Donner weaves it all together with a Carmina Burana -esque score . And yet the eternal question lingers "What do you know about my son"? How can you not consider what you would do faced with this horror scenario? That is why this is so horrifyingly personal and a must watch!

    The Omen is a supernatural thriller/Satanist horror film directed Richard Donner of Superman and Lethal Weapon fame and stars Gregory Peck, David Warner and Patrick "The Second Doctor" Troughton. Its central premise surrounds the biblical myth about the birth of the Antichrist and the inevitable doom which will it bring. Add to that creepy and effective score, great performances, good script and rock solid direction and you will get a horror classic. Like The Shining, Omen relies on build up, suspense and performances to bring the scares rather than go for the gore and jump scares. Plus, you can never go wrong when you cast classic Hollywood actors as your leads in horror movies. Gregory Peck is absolutely brilliant as the lead and gives his performance much intensity. This could have been even cooler if they could have gotten Jimmy Stewart or Henry Fonda for the part. I just love when these old-school actors appear in movies where people suffer gory deaths and swear a lot. The rest of the cast is great. David Warner gives his usual powerhouse performance, Patrick Troughton is great but sadly he is in it for few scenes and Billie Whitelaw is wonderfully creepy as the satanist governess. The direction by Richard Donner is as rock solid as you might expect from him. He knows where to put the camera and understands that characters and atmosphere are more essential to good horror rather than silly jump scares and gore. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is absolutely phenomenal and sends the chills up my spine. Without it, The Omen wouldn't be half as creepy and unsettling as it is. The only real faults with the film, lies in the script. There are few dodgy moments that would make some people shout at the screen. How in the hell, the parents couldn't tell that their governess was up for no good. Nearly the whole first 30 or 40 minutes the parents acted fairly stupid and because the plot said so. But after that, it got much better and felt much more natural. But aside from some inconsistencies, The Omen is absolutely fantastic. The Omen is a must see for any horror fans. It's as good as mainstream horror will ever get. And watching the ultimate good guy Gregory Peck in a satanic horror film is always nice. If you are looking for boobs, booze and teenagers partying, you won't find it here.

    The one real reason I wanted to watch this is because I saw the fourth movie due to a debate on message boards and after that movie left a bad taste in my mouth I wanted to watch the original just so I can't associate "The Omen" with bad acting, laugh-out-loud hilarity and absent suspense. I honestly though it was decent. I'm sure people may know of this plot. An ambassador finds out his adopted child is really the offspring of Satan (or the Antichrist - however you want to word it - both have a nice ring to it). People around are dying in freak accidents. A photographer who helps this ambassador helps him because photographs have predicted both the freak accidents and he took a picture of himself that shows him getting decapitated. This movie is pretty good. I don't really care much for the concept though (it's because I'm an atheist - I haven't been a Christian for about 5 years). The directing is very suspenseful, but a complaint about that is that the suspenseful scenes are a little too few, but it was enough to keep me watching until the very end. I might watch the other 2, but if I can watch the fourth one then I'm pretty sure I've watched the worst Omen movie.

    A film that polarises opinion irrespective of its religious incantations, some unimpressed by its comic-book style hokum, others like myself willing to be immersed in the tale of the anti-Christ (Stephens) born into a wealthy American family living abroad, setting a course for Satan's second coming. Peck, playing American Ambassador to the UK and his wife Lee Remick lose their child during birth, but with the assistance of corrupt clergyman Martin Benson, Peck manages to procure a replacement child of shady origins. In the history of bad decisions, this is right up there with the most catastrophic, as the baby Damien wields his unassuming temperament against those conspiring to subdue the rise of the devil on earth. David Warner co-stars as the intrepid photo journalist who's bitten off more than he can chew investigating a series of strange events surrounding the family, former "Doctor Who" incarnation Patrick Troughton has a memorable supporting role as a doom-saying priest, and other notable roles are played with aplomb by Martin Benson, Leo McKern, Bruce Boa, John Stride and Anthony Nicholls to name a few. Jack's daughter, Holly Palance has a great cameo in one of the film's many penultimate moments, early on at the birthday party. Billie Whitelaw's inspired performance as the sinister house-keeper is perhaps the template that would be emulated many times over (e.g. Dimitra Arliss in "Bless the Child" for example), and in my opinion, the real sleeper in this film. Her measured performance is one of the key aspects that elevates this tale beyond the comic-book hokum for which some reviewers hold contempt, notwithstanding the fuzzy logic on the religious overtures, which to be honest, who really cares. It's only a movie, and a chilling one at that, director Richard Donner immortalising himself with this effort, which in my opinion is easily in the top ten horror films ever made for its imagery, atmosphere, visual effects and of course, "Ave Satani" soundtrack.

David Warner co-stars as the intrepid photo journalist who's bitten off more than he can chew investigating a series of strange events surrounding the family, former "Doctor Who" incarnation Patrick Troughton has a memorable supporting role as a doom-saying priest, and other notable roles are played with aplomb by Martin Benson, Leo McKern, Bruce Boa, John Stride and Anthony Nicholls to name a few. Jack's daughter, Holly Palance has a great cameo in one of the film's many penultimate moments, early on at the birthday party. Billie Whitelaw's inspired performance as the sinister house-keeper is perhaps the template that would be emulated many times over (e.g. Dimitra Arliss in "Bless the Child" for example), and in my opinion, the real sleeper in this film. Her measured performance is one of the key aspects that elevates this tale beyond the comic-book hokum for which some reviewers hold contempt, notwithstanding the fuzzy logic on the religious overtures, which to be honest, who really cares. It's only a movie, and a chilling one at that, director Richard Donner immortalising himself with this effort, which in my opinion is easily in the top ten horror films ever made for its imagery, atmosphere, visual effects and of course, "Ave Satani" soundtrack.

    As a devout Horror fan who fancies himself a Horror freak, I've wanted to familiarize myself with some of the genre's classics. The process included watching the full series of Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th and Children of the Corn, and it was only a matter of time before my "travels" took me to The Omen. While watching the film (as well as writing this review) I've made sure to bear in mind that this was a film from the late 70's, when several aspects of the Cinema field have not yet developed, or at least not yet fully matured. For instance, what I've found to be most blunt, has been the acting. Throughout the film I haven't been able to not notice that the actors appear to be acting for the sake of acting, rather than to try and appear realistic and assist suspense of disbelief (very much like actors in musicals and plays in the theatre, who act like actors in a play or musical rather than like "real" characters). Furthermore, the "struggle" scenes (weather with other characters or beasts) all appear very unrealistic. And lastly, little Harvey Stephens, while adorable and precious, simply failed to frighten me in any way... Much of that criticism is probably due to the time the film was screened, when the a woman hanging herself, a man having his head chopped of and the very thought of children being possessed by the devil were enough to startle, unnerve and even shock an audience. Add to that the fact that I happen to be Jewish and not Christian, and you might understand why The Omen didn't really leave such an impression on me. However, having said that, if I do take consideration of the time the film was screened, I can very well understand how groundbreaking and innovative it must have been, and how many spectators have probably been really frightened by it. The story and script were good, the poor lighting and visual effects were probably (yet again) fine for the 70's, and the ending probably had people on the edges of their seats. All in all, I'm afraid I've been born too late and am too young to be able to fully appreciate The Omen, one of the masterpieces of the genre. I consider it my personal loss. However, I've had a great time watching it, and I recommend it to anyone who's a Horror fan and/or a fan of late 70's cinema.

    Gregory Peck looks suitably concerned as it turns out that the baby he hastily adopted on the night of his own baby's death may be the son of the devil. Turns out the book of revelations details the second coming of the Antichrist or something, so it's an all out adventure for Peck and sidekick David Warner as they try to get to the bottom of the conspiracy. Good old Christian doctrine comes into play here as we've got the doubting (at first) Peck, who writes off Damien's behaviour as that of a normal five-year-old. As the proud father of my own little Damien, I have spent many an hour checking my kid's scalp for three sixes, especially after he's tried to put our budgie in a blender or destroyed a piece of furniture, but at least I haven't had a priest turning up at my door pleading for me to kill my own child. Also, I'm sure that when our babysitter killed herself it was just due to the brimstone tinged contents of our kid's nappy, rather than being compelled to swing from a rope by a persuasive dog. The first Omen film is rather good. It's filled with dread and there's some pretty good set pieces in there, plus when you've got decent actors like Peck and Warner playing it pretty straight that helps things too. It's still worth a watch after all these years, but sad to say any of the sequels don't really stand up to the original.

    An American ambassador (Gregory Peck) learns to his horror that his son (Harvey Stephens) is actually the literal Antichrist. Some people have compared this film to "The Exorcist", another Satanic film released around the same time. Others have compared it to the remake (which, good or bad, owes its existence to this film). I have no interest in doing either. The film stands on its own merits, with the solid cast of Gregory Peck (a legend) and Lee Remick. David Warner, perhaps the last great horror actor, plays a significantly large role in the second half. And even the minor characters -- especially Father Brennan -- carry the picture. This is not to mention the director, Mr. Donner, whose carry only went up from here. What sells this film is the atmosphere. Jerry Goldsmith has an incredible score (those Latin chants are key). And even after going more than a decade without seeing the picture, the death scenes stood starkly in my mind as fresh as if they had just happened. This is one of the horror greats.

    Gregory Peck & Lee Remick play Robert and Katharine Thorn, a U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain and his wife in this blockbuster hit supernatural thriller. Katharine has just suffered a miscarriage, and rather than tell her, he instead adopts an orphan baby made available to him by the hospital, and passes him off as their baby boy. Years later, strange and sinister occurrences start happening around the boy(named Damien), until Father Brennan( played by "Doctor Who" actor Patrick Troughton, who is excellent in his small but crucial role) tries to explain of Damien's true parentage, but Thorn rejects this as ravings. Others try to warn Mr. Thorn about the danger, until Robert is confronted by irrefutable proof of Damien's origins, but by then it could be too late... Intriguing but overheated thriller certainly is slickly made and watchable, but credibility is low, and story relies far too much on melodrama and shock value, rather than thoughtful horror drama.

    When you see that mind game that is made trough the whole movie and the effects that are left on you while watching it and it's made in 1976... I mean that this is one of the top movies I ever watched. Of course the acting is on top level as well and the plot is picked on a long shot. Little Damien was remarkable during his scenes and the scary parts are still scary after 37 years. I just regret that i couldn't watch it earlier because i think it would have even better effect on me than now. If you are looking for a movie that scares you, this is what you need to see. I have seen a lot of scary horror, psycho movies in my life and this movie is the top movie for that genre. It's just Richard Donner's masterpiece.

    As horror movies go, "The Omen" is one of the more meaningless ones with almost no intellectual or thematic appeal. Peck's character is so inclined not to heed what is told him that he virtually seals his fate and that of his wife, Lee Remick. He has been told to be saved by Christ. He doesn't listen the first time. All right. Write that off as being stubborn and haughty. But after learning about Damien, he still doesn't take this advice. Instead he wanders off doing needless detective work when he already has substantial information that warrants calling on the Holy Spirit. The plot has too many holes, such as Billie Whitelaw waltzing in to his house and taking over. Given the dark power's force that he has seen work against the first governess and his wife, you would think he might arm himself against contingencies, but he does not. Why, I'd like to know, were police so anxious to stop him at the end? I must have missed some critical plot point, or did I? There are some excellent horror movies out there, such as "Curse of the Demon", some of the Hammers, the old Universals, "White Zombie", Dr. X, and so on. In my opinion, "The Omen" is just average and doesn't come up to them. I think that it's missing some critical elements in the story. The acting, settings and direction here are adequate enough. I think it's the story where the weakness is.

    The moral dilemmas, the mounting tension, stoic Gregory Peck and Lee Remick coming to their own separate conclusions, the baboons, the Priest, the photographer revelation, the graveyard dogs, that freaking scary Nanny and our beloved Damian: the scariest kid on film as the Antichrist! The mythology needed little explanation and the acting took this horror to the highest level of suspension of disbelief. Director Richard Donner weaves it all together with a Carmina Burana -esque score . And yet the eternal question lingers "What do you know about my son"? How can you not consider what you would do faced with this horror scenario? That is why this is so horrifyingly personal and a must watch!

    The Omen is a supernatural thriller/Satanist horror film directed Richard Donner of Superman and Lethal Weapon fame and stars Gregory Peck, David Warner and Patrick "The Second Doctor" Troughton. Its central premise surrounds the biblical myth about the birth of the Antichrist and the inevitable doom which will it bring. Add to that creepy and effective score, great performances, good script and rock solid direction and you will get a horror classic. Like The Shining, Omen relies on build up, suspense and performances to bring the scares rather than go for the gore and jump scares. Plus, you can never go wrong when you cast classic Hollywood actors as your leads in horror movies. Gregory Peck is absolutely brilliant as the lead and gives his performance much intensity. This could have been even cooler if they could have gotten Jimmy Stewart or Henry Fonda for the part. I just love when these old-school actors appear in movies where people suffer gory deaths and swear a lot. The rest of the cast is great. David Warner gives his usual powerhouse performance, Patrick Troughton is great but sadly he is in it for few scenes and Billie Whitelaw is wonderfully creepy as the satanist governess. The direction by Richard Donner is as rock solid as you might expect from him. He knows where to put the camera and understands that characters and atmosphere are more essential to good horror rather than silly jump scares and gore. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is absolutely phenomenal and sends the chills up my spine. Without it, The Omen wouldn't be half as creepy and unsettling as it is. The only real faults with the film, lies in the script. There are few dodgy moments that would make some people shout at the screen. How in the hell, the parents couldn't tell that their governess was up for no good. Nearly the whole first 30 or 40 minutes the parents acted fairly stupid and because the plot said so. But after that, it got much better and felt much more natural. But aside from some inconsistencies, The Omen is absolutely fantastic. The Omen is a must see for any horror fans. It's as good as mainstream horror will ever get. And watching the ultimate good guy Gregory Peck in a satanic horror film is always nice. If you are looking for boobs, booze and teenagers partying, you won't find it here.

    The one real reason I wanted to watch this is because I saw the fourth movie due to a debate on message boards and after that movie left a bad taste in my mouth I wanted to watch the original just so I can't associate "The Omen" with bad acting, laugh-out-loud hilarity and absent suspense. I honestly though it was decent. I'm sure people may know of this plot. An ambassador finds out his adopted child is really the offspring of Satan (or the Antichrist - however you want to word it - both have a nice ring to it). People around are dying in freak accidents. A photographer who helps this ambassador helps him because photographs have predicted both the freak accidents and he took a picture of himself that shows him getting decapitated. This movie is pretty good. I don't really care much for the concept though (it's because I'm an atheist - I haven't been a Christian for about 5 years). The directing is very suspenseful, but a complaint about that is that the suspenseful scenes are a little too few, but it was enough to keep me watching until the very end. I might watch the other 2, but if I can watch the fourth one then I'm pretty sure I've watched the worst Omen movie.

    A film that polarises opinion irrespective of its religious incantations, some unimpressed by its comic-book style hokum, others like myself willing to be immersed in the tale of the anti-Christ (Stephens) born into a wealthy American family living abroad, setting a course for Satan's second coming. Peck, playing American Ambassador to the UK and his wife Lee Remick lose their child during birth, but with the assistance of corrupt clergyman Martin Benson, Peck manages to procure a replacement child of shady origins. In the history of bad decisions, this is right up there with the most catastrophic, as the baby Damien wields his unassuming temperament against those conspiring to subdue the rise of the devil on earth. David Warner co-stars as the intrepid photo journalist who's bitten off more than he can chew investigating a series of strange events surrounding the family, former "Doctor Who" incarnation Patrick Troughton has a memorable supporting role as a doom-saying priest, and other notable roles are played with aplomb by Martin Benson, Leo McKern, Bruce Boa, John Stride and Anthony Nicholls to name a few. Jack's daughter, Holly Palance has a great cameo in one of the film's many penultimate moments, early on at the birthday party. Billie Whitelaw's inspired performance as the sinister house-keeper is perhaps the template that would be emulated many times over (e.g. Dimitra Arliss in "Bless the Child" for example), and in my opinion, the real sleeper in this film.

An ambassador finds out his adopted child is really the offspring of Satan (or the Antichrist - however you want to word it - both have a nice ring to it). People around are dying in freak accidents. A photographer who helps this ambassador helps him because photographs have predicted both the freak accidents and he took a picture of himself that shows him getting decapitated. This movie is pretty good. I don't really care much for the concept though (it's because I'm an atheist - I haven't been a Christian for about 5 years). The directing is very suspenseful, but a complaint about that is that the suspenseful scenes are a little too few, but it was enough to keep me watching until the very end. I might watch the other 2, but if I can watch the fourth one then I'm pretty sure I've watched the worst Omen movie.

    A film that polarises opinion irrespective of its religious incantations, some unimpressed by its comic-book style hokum, others like myself willing to be immersed in the tale of the anti-Christ (Stephens) born into a wealthy American family living abroad, setting a course for Satan's second coming. Peck, playing American Ambassador to the UK and his wife Lee Remick lose their child during birth, but with the assistance of corrupt clergyman Martin Benson, Peck manages to procure a replacement child of shady origins. In the history of bad decisions, this is right up there with the most catastrophic, as the baby Damien wields his unassuming temperament against those conspiring to subdue the rise of the devil on earth. David Warner co-stars as the intrepid photo journalist who's bitten off more than he can chew investigating a series of strange events surrounding the family, former "Doctor Who" incarnation Patrick Troughton has a memorable supporting role as a doom-saying priest, and other notable roles are played with aplomb by Martin Benson, Leo McKern, Bruce Boa, John Stride and Anthony Nicholls to name a few. Jack's daughter, Holly Palance has a great cameo in one of the film's many penultimate moments, early on at the birthday party. Billie Whitelaw's inspired performance as the sinister house-keeper is perhaps the template that would be emulated many times over (e.g. Dimitra Arliss in "Bless the Child" for example), and in my opinion, the real sleeper in this film. Her measured performance is one of the key aspects that elevates this tale beyond the comic-book hokum for which some reviewers hold contempt, notwithstanding the fuzzy logic on the religious overtures, which to be honest, who really cares. It's only a movie, and a chilling one at that, director Richard Donner immortalising himself with this effort, which in my opinion is easily in the top ten horror films ever made for its imagery, atmosphere, visual effects and of course, "Ave Satani" soundtrack.

    As a devout Horror fan who fancies himself a Horror freak, I've wanted to familiarize myself with some of the genre's classics. The process included watching the full series of Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th and Children of the Corn, and it was only a matter of time before my "travels" took me to The Omen. While watching the film (as well as writing this review) I've made sure to bear in mind that this was a film from the late 70's, when several aspects of the Cinema field have not yet developed, or at least not yet fully matured. For instance, what I've found to be most blunt, has been the acting. Throughout the film I haven't been able to not notice that the actors appear to be acting for the sake of acting, rather than to try and appear realistic and assist suspense of disbelief (very much like actors in musicals and plays in the theatre, who act like actors in a play or musical rather than like "real" characters). Furthermore, the "struggle" scenes (weather with other characters or beasts) all appear very unrealistic. And lastly, little Harvey Stephens, while adorable and precious, simply failed to frighten me in any way... Much of that criticism is probably due to the time the film was screened, when the a woman hanging herself, a man having his head chopped of and the very thought of children being possessed by the devil were enough to startle, unnerve and even shock an audience. Add to that the fact that I happen to be Jewish and not Christian, and you might understand why The Omen didn't really leave such an impression on me. However, having said that, if I do take consideration of the time the film was screened, I can very well understand how groundbreaking and innovative it must have been, and how many spectators have probably been really frightened by it. The story and script were good, the poor lighting and visual effects were probably (yet again) fine for the 70's, and the ending probably had people on the edges of their seats. All in all, I'm afraid I've been born too late and am too young to be able to fully appreciate The Omen, one of the masterpieces of the genre. I consider it my personal loss. However, I've had a great time watching it, and I recommend it to anyone who's a Horror fan and/or a fan of late 70's cinema.

    Gregory Peck looks suitably concerned as it turns out that the baby he hastily adopted on the night of his own baby's death may be the son of the devil. Turns out the book of revelations details the second coming of the Antichrist or something, so it's an all out adventure for Peck and sidekick David Warner as they try to get to the bottom of the conspiracy. Good old Christian doctrine comes into play here as we've got the doubting (at first) Peck, who writes off Damien's behaviour as that of a normal five-year-old. As the proud father of my own little Damien, I have spent many an hour checking my kid's scalp for three sixes, especially after he's tried to put our budgie in a blender or destroyed a piece of furniture, but at least I haven't had a priest turning up at my door pleading for me to kill my own child. Also, I'm sure that when our babysitter killed herself it was just due to the brimstone tinged contents of our kid's nappy, rather than being compelled to swing from a rope by a persuasive dog. The first Omen film is rather good. It's filled with dread and there's some pretty good set pieces in there, plus when you've got decent actors like Peck and Warner playing it pretty straight that helps things too. It's still worth a watch after all these years, but sad to say any of the sequels don't really stand up to the original.

    An American ambassador (Gregory Peck) learns to his horror that his son (Harvey Stephens) is actually the literal Antichrist. Some people have compared this film to "The Exorcist", another Satanic film released around the same time. Others have compared it to the remake (which, good or bad, owes its existence to this film). I have no interest in doing either. The film stands on its own merits, with the solid cast of Gregory Peck (a legend) and Lee Remick. David Warner, perhaps the last great horror actor, plays a significantly large role in the second half. And even the minor characters -- especially Father Brennan -- carry the picture. This is not to mention the director, Mr. Donner, whose carry only went up from here. What sells this film is the atmosphere. Jerry Goldsmith has an incredible score (those Latin chants are key). And even after going more than a decade without seeing the picture, the death scenes stood starkly in my mind as fresh as if they had just happened. This is one of the horror greats.

    Gregory Peck & Lee Remick play Robert and Katharine Thorn, a U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain and his wife in this blockbuster hit supernatural thriller. Katharine has just suffered a miscarriage, and rather than tell her, he instead adopts an orphan baby made available to him by the hospital, and passes him off as their baby boy. Years later, strange and sinister occurrences start happening around the boy(named Damien), until Father Brennan( played by "Doctor Who" actor Patrick Troughton, who is excellent in his small but crucial role) tries to explain of Damien's true parentage, but Thorn rejects this as ravings. Others try to warn Mr. Thorn about the danger, until Robert is confronted by irrefutable proof of Damien's origins, but by then it could be too late... Intriguing but overheated thriller certainly is slickly made and watchable, but credibility is low, and story relies far too much on melodrama and shock value, rather than thoughtful horror drama.

    When you see that mind game that is made trough the whole movie and the effects that are left on you while watching it and it's made in 1976... I mean that this is one of the top movies I ever watched. Of course the acting is on top level as well and the plot is picked on a long shot. Little Damien was remarkable during his scenes and the scary parts are still scary after 37 years. I just regret that i couldn't watch it earlier because i think it would have even better effect on me than now. If you are looking for a movie that scares you, this is what you need to see. I have seen a lot of scary horror, psycho movies in my life and this movie is the top movie for that genre. It's just Richard Donner's masterpiece.

    As horror movies go, "The Omen" is one of the more meaningless ones with almost no intellectual or thematic appeal. Peck's character is so inclined not to heed what is told him that he virtually seals his fate and that of his wife, Lee Remick. He has been told to be saved by Christ. He doesn't listen the first time. All right. Write that off as being stubborn and haughty. But after learning about Damien, he still doesn't take this advice. Instead he wanders off doing needless detective work when he already has substantial information that warrants calling on the Holy Spirit. The plot has too many holes, such as Billie Whitelaw waltzing in to his house and taking over. Given the dark power's force that he has seen work against the first governess and his wife, you would think he might arm himself against contingencies, but he does not. Why, I'd like to know, were police so anxious to stop him at the end? I must have missed some critical plot point, or did I? There are some excellent horror movies out there, such as "Curse of the Demon", some of the Hammers, the old Universals, "White Zombie", Dr. X, and so on. In my opinion, "The Omen" is just average and doesn't come up to them. I think that it's missing some critical elements in the story. The acting, settings and direction here are adequate enough. I think it's the story where the weakness is.

    The moral dilemmas, the mounting tension, stoic Gregory Peck and Lee Remick coming to their own separate conclusions, the baboons, the Priest, the photographer revelation, the graveyard dogs, that freaking scary Nanny and our beloved Damian: the scariest kid on film as the Antichrist! The mythology needed little explanation and the acting took this horror to the highest level of suspension of disbelief. Director Richard Donner weaves it all together with a Carmina Burana -esque score . And yet the eternal question lingers "What do you know about my son"? How can you not consider what you would do faced with this horror scenario? That is why this is so horrifyingly personal and a must watch!

    The Omen is a supernatural thriller/Satanist horror film directed Richard Donner of Superman and Lethal Weapon fame and stars Gregory Peck, David Warner and Patrick "The Second Doctor" Troughton. Its central premise surrounds the biblical myth about the birth of the Antichrist and the inevitable doom which will it bring. Add to that creepy and effective score, great performances, good script and rock solid direction and you will get a horror classic. Like The Shining, Omen relies on build up, suspense and performances to bring the scares rather than go for the gore and jump scares. Plus, you can never go wrong when you cast classic Hollywood actors as your leads in horror movies. Gregory Peck is absolutely brilliant as the lead and gives his performance much intensity. This could have been even cooler if they could have gotten Jimmy Stewart or Henry Fonda for the part. I just love when these old-school actors appear in movies where people suffer gory deaths and swear a lot. The rest of the cast is great. David Warner gives his usual powerhouse performance, Patrick Troughton is great but sadly he is in it for few scenes and Billie Whitelaw is wonderfully creepy as the satanist governess. The direction by Richard Donner is as rock solid as you might expect from him. He knows where to put the camera and understands that characters and atmosphere are more essential to good horror rather than silly jump scares and gore. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is absolutely phenomenal and sends the chills up my spine. Without it, The Omen wouldn't be half as creepy and unsettling as it is. The only real faults with the film, lies in the script. There are few dodgy moments that would make some people shout at the screen. How in the hell, the parents couldn't tell that their governess was up for no good. Nearly the whole first 30 or 40 minutes the parents acted fairly stupid and because the plot said so. But after that, it got much better and felt much more natural. But aside from some inconsistencies, The Omen is absolutely fantastic. The Omen is a must see for any horror fans. It's as good as mainstream horror will ever get. And watching the ultimate good guy Gregory Peck in a satanic horror film is always nice. If you are looking for boobs, booze and teenagers partying, you won't find it here.

The direction by Richard Donner is as rock solid as you might expect from him. He knows where to put the camera and understands that characters and atmosphere are more essential to good horror rather than silly jump scares and gore. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is absolutely phenomenal and sends the chills up my spine. Without it, The Omen wouldn't be half as creepy and unsettling as it is. The only real faults with the film, lies in the script. There are few dodgy moments that would make some people shout at the screen. How in the hell, the parents couldn't tell that their governess was up for no good. Nearly the whole first 30 or 40 minutes the parents acted fairly stupid and because the plot said so. But after that, it got much better and felt much more natural. But aside from some inconsistencies, The Omen is absolutely fantastic. The Omen is a must see for any horror fans. It's as good as mainstream horror will ever get. And watching the ultimate good guy Gregory Peck in a satanic horror film is always nice. If you are looking for boobs, booze and teenagers partying, you won't find it here.

    The one real reason I wanted to watch this is because I saw the fourth movie due to a debate on message boards and after that movie left a bad taste in my mouth I wanted to watch the original just so I can't associate "The Omen" with bad acting, laugh-out-loud hilarity and absent suspense. I honestly though it was decent. I'm sure people may know of this plot. An ambassador finds out his adopted child is really the offspring of Satan (or the Antichrist - however you want to word it - both have a nice ring to it). People around are dying in freak accidents. A photographer who helps this ambassador helps him because photographs have predicted both the freak accidents and he took a picture of himself that shows him getting decapitated. This movie is pretty good. I don't really care much for the concept though (it's because I'm an atheist - I haven't been a Christian for about 5 years). The directing is very suspenseful, but a complaint about that is that the suspenseful scenes are a little too few, but it was enough to keep me watching until the very end. I might watch the other 2, but if I can watch the fourth one then I'm pretty sure I've watched the worst Omen movie.

    A film that polarises opinion irrespective of its religious incantations, some unimpressed by its comic-book style hokum, others like myself willing to be immersed in the tale of the anti-Christ (Stephens) born into a wealthy American family living abroad, setting a course for Satan's second coming. Peck, playing American Ambassador to the UK and his wife Lee Remick lose their child during birth, but with the assistance of corrupt clergyman Martin Benson, Peck manages to procure a replacement child of shady origins. In the history of bad decisions, this is right up there with the most catastrophic, as the baby Damien wields his unassuming temperament against those conspiring to subdue the rise of the devil on earth. David Warner co-stars as the intrepid photo journalist who's bitten off more than he can chew investigating a series of strange events surrounding the family, former "Doctor Who" incarnation Patrick Troughton has a memorable supporting role as a doom-saying priest, and other notable roles are played with aplomb by Martin Benson, Leo McKern, Bruce Boa, John Stride and Anthony Nicholls to name a few. Jack's daughter, Holly Palance has a great cameo in one of the film's many penultimate moments, early on at the birthday party. Billie Whitelaw's inspired performance as the sinister house-keeper is perhaps the template that would be emulated many times over (e.g. Dimitra Arliss in "Bless the Child" for example), and in my opinion, the real sleeper in this film. Her measured performance is one of the key aspects that elevates this tale beyond the comic-book hokum for which some reviewers hold contempt, notwithstanding the fuzzy logic on the religious overtures, which to be honest, who really cares. It's only a movie, and a chilling one at that, director Richard Donner immortalising himself with this effort, which in my opinion is easily in the top ten horror films ever made for its imagery, atmosphere, visual effects and of course, "Ave Satani" soundtrack.

    Must have been excellent in the late 70's, but in today's standards - lacking, to say the least.

    As a devout Horror fan who fancies himself a Horror freak, I've wanted to familiarize myself with some of the genre's classics. The process included watching the full series of Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th and Children of the Corn, and it was only a matter of time before my "travels" took me to The Omen. While watching the film (as well as writing this review) I've made sure to bear in mind that this was a film from the late 70's, when several aspects of the Cinema field have not yet developed, or at least not yet fully matured. For instance, what I've found to be most blunt, has been the acting. Throughout the film I haven't been able to not notice that the actors appear to be acting for the sake of acting, rather than to try and appear realistic and assist suspense of disbelief (very much like actors in musicals and plays in the theatre, who act like actors in a play or musical rather than like "real" characters). Furthermore, the "struggle" scenes (weather with other characters or beasts) all appear very unrealistic. And lastly, little Harvey Stephens, while adorable and precious, simply failed to frighten me in any way... Much of that criticism is probably due to the time the film was screened, when the a woman hanging herself, a man having his head chopped of and the very thought of children being possessed by the devil were enough to startle, unnerve and even shock an audience. Add to that the fact that I happen to be Jewish and not Christian, and you might understand why The Omen didn't really leave such an impression on me. However, having said that, if I do take consideration of the time the film was screened, I can very well understand how groundbreaking and innovative it must have been, and how many spectators have probably been really frightened by it. The story and script were good, the poor lighting and visual effects were probably (yet again) fine for the 70's, and the ending probably had people on the edges of their seats. All in all, I'm afraid I've been born too late and am too young to be able to fully appreciate The Omen, one of the masterpieces of the genre. I consider it my personal loss. However, I've had a great time watching it, and I recommend it to anyone who's a Horror fan and/or a fan of late 70's cinema.

    Gregory Peck looks suitably concerned as it turns out that the baby he hastily adopted on the night of his own baby's death may be the son of the devil. Turns out the book of revelations details the second coming of the Antichrist or something, so it's an all out adventure for Peck and sidekick David Warner as they try to get to the bottom of the conspiracy. Good old Christian doctrine comes into play here as we've got the doubting (at first) Peck, who writes off Damien's behaviour as that of a normal five-year-old. As the proud father of my own little Damien, I have spent many an hour checking my kid's scalp for three sixes, especially after he's tried to put our budgie in a blender or destroyed a piece of furniture, but at least I haven't had a priest turning up at my door pleading for me to kill my own child. Also, I'm sure that when our babysitter killed herself it was just due to the brimstone tinged contents of our kid's nappy, rather than being compelled to swing from a rope by a persuasive dog. The first Omen film is rather good. It's filled with dread and there's some pretty good set pieces in there, plus when you've got decent actors like Peck and Warner playing it pretty straight that helps things too. It's still worth a watch after all these years, but sad to say any of the sequels don't really stand up to the original.

    An American ambassador (Gregory Peck) learns to his horror that his son (Harvey Stephens) is actually the literal Antichrist. Some people have compared this film to "The Exorcist", another Satanic film released around the same time. Others have compared it to the remake (which, good or bad, owes its existence to this film). I have no interest in doing either. The film stands on its own merits, with the solid cast of Gregory Peck (a legend) and Lee Remick. David Warner, perhaps the last great horror actor, plays a significantly large role in the second half. And even the minor characters -- especially Father Brennan -- carry the picture. This is not to mention the director, Mr. Donner, whose carry only went up from here. What sells this film is the atmosphere. Jerry Goldsmith has an incredible score (those Latin chants are key). And even after going more than a decade without seeing the picture, the death scenes stood starkly in my mind as fresh as if they had just happened. This is one of the horror greats.
