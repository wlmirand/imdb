 <sinopse>
  Mark runs a pirate radio station and causes an uproar when he speaks his mind and enthralls fellow teens.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Mark is an intelligent but shy teenager who has just moved to Arizona from the East Coast. His parents give him a short-wave radio so he can talk to his pals, but instead he sets up shop as pirate deejay Hard Harry, who becomes a hero to his peers while inspiring the wrath of the local high school principal. When one of Harry's listeners commits suicide and Harry- inspired chaos breaks out at the school, the authorities are called in to put a stop to Harry's broadcasts.

    Christian Slater plays Mark Hunter, a shy teenager who has just moved from the East coast to Arizona. His parents give him a short wave radio set that he turns into a pirate radio station where his shyness evaporates, and instead he uses the handle "Hard Harry", where he vents his frustrations and confusions to his fellow teenagers, who it turns out are very receptive to this message, and "Hard Harry" finds himself the most popular and influential person in town, much to his high school principal's consternation. Things take a dark turn when a troubled teenage listener commits suicide, and the authorities become eager to shut down his illegal broadcasts. Smart and appealing film has a fine performance from Christian Slater, that really speaks to the hearts and minds of teenagers, and still rings true. Dramatically uneven, but will resonate strongly with people who like to listen to talk radio.

    "Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religions destroy spirituality." - Michael Ellner Alan Moyle's "Pump Up The Volume" stars Christian Slater as Mark Hunter, a high school student who lives in a sleepy, Arizonan town. Looking to lash out at the world, Mark starts an FM pirate radio station. This station becomes an outlet for his angst and aggression. The film then becomes a teen version of "Network" or "Rebel Without a Cause", Mark rallying fellow disaffected and alienated youths until he becomes the unwitting leader of a minor student revolution. In historical terms, Hunter's caught in the deadlock of late capitalism, or what Francis Fukuyama called "the end of history", a time populated by what Nietzsche called "the last men"; pathetic, contemptible things. Fukuyama's position counterpointed that of Hegel and Marx, who saw historical development as a purposeful journey from primitive stages of consciousness to "something better". This goes against the "there is no alternative" (T.I.N.A) mantra of late capitalism, a stance explicitly reborn in the mid 20th century, but which has bee around in various forms much longer, perhaps starting with Thomas Malthus, a nineteenth century progenitor of "no alternative" politics and its credo of "permanent" scarcity and "necessary poverty". Malthus contested nineteenth century radicals who were steadfast in their belief that labour, properly deployed, could usher in a new society. Indeed, the initial need for elites to publicly announce the absence of any alternative to existing social arrangements was entirely a defensive move, in response to such radical ideas. One of the first to counter T.I.N.A was William Godwin. In his 1793 book, "Enquiry Concerning Political Justice", he argued that the "existing state creates a servile and truckling spirit," and that the cruel monotony of the system "produces a kind of stupid and hopeless vacancy in every face". From Godwin can be drawn a line to libertarians, anarchist communism, socialism and even the labour theory of value. The British government then tried to prosecute Godwin for treason, but abandoned the idea. Godwin was instead attacked by Malthus, who in "Principles of Political Economy" essentially defended class structures and even went so far as to advocate starving the poor because "that way they wouldn't breed too heavily". In anticipation of the permanent war economy of the United States, Malthus would even offer war and state debt as perfect mechanisms for "enhancing value through the careful calibration of scarcity". So though white and privileged, Hunter's part of a long list of validly ticked off people. On air he calls himself "Hard Harry", and begins his radio program with Leonard Cohen's "Everybody Knows", the lyrics "everybody knows the dice are loaded, everybody rolls with their fingers crossed" heralding his audio rants. "All the great themes have been used up and turned into theme parks," he tells his audience, as he begins to develop a sort of naive political manifesto. Where adults condescend, he empathises, where they ignore, he provides an outlet for the hopes, dreams, fears and tragedies of other youths. Elsewhere Hunter challenges the ethos of his college, which cares more about test scores and image than actual education. Unsurprisingly, his college is named after Hubert Humphrey, a despicable archetype of cold war neoliberalism and apologist for much violence (Vietnam, the police beatings of peace activists etc). "The truth is a virus," Hunter tells his listeners, as he becomes increasingly subversive and empowering, shaking fellow students out of apathy. "It begins with us! Not the experts, but the ones who need it most!" Pretty soon he's changed from an object of hero worship to one of strategic appropriation, youths taking from him what they need to advance their own empowerment and emancipation. Elsewhere the songs he plays are politically charged, but in offbeat ways. There's "Freedom of Speech" by Above the Law, Ice T states "I've no time to whisper in your ear", Hunter plays "Wave of Mutilation" by the Pixies, has Soundgarden say "Accused and convicted for nothing" and Liquid Jesus "Stand, and they will make you crawl". "Nothing is more important than a good education!" adults tell Hunter. "Except the basic right to it," he counters. Slowly he moves from isolation and individualism to community and collective action. He accepts that he has a responsibility to his listeners, understands that meaning and expression are terrains of political contestation, repeatedly fought over, but then quickly finds himself chased by the police and FBI. They want to shut him down. To silence him. The film ends with Harry on the run, romantic engagement finally deemed inadequate, until a final sequence in which every student in America starts their own pirate radio station. This is offered as something positive, but the internet/Facebook generation's told us otherwise: the podiums afforded by technology increase atomization and tend to become just more outlets for narcissism. Traditionally, young people have energised democratic movements. But resistance to domination has been subdued and power has long created societal institutions designed to break resistance. The young, reflexively impotent, are perhaps now entirely acquiesced to the idea that they can and will be repeatedly screwed. Large debts, and the fear they create, have become a pacifying force. Elsewhere we psychopathologize and medicate noncompliance, a fact which led Erich Fromm to state that "today the function of psychiatry and medicine threatens to become the tool in the manipulation of man." Indeed, schools themselves inculcate compliance not democracy, and routinely traffic standardisation and fear. The intelligent are shamed, surveillance is normalised and fundamentalist Religion and Fundamentalist Consumerism are exalted above all things. And so, like Howard Beale, Hunter yells from a radio, before being shut down. 8.9/10  One of the best teen movies of the 1990s, despite a weak, corny third act.

    Pump Up the Volume might have been the true opening salvo of the 90s, and the voice of Generation X, but it speaks to every teen of every generation. It is about raising your voice, being heard, but only with the advent of the Internet was its dream fully realized. This is the type of movie that will make you want to write your own blog, make a video journal, or do a podcast. It has that quality that grip people attention and make them do things worthwhile with their lives. It's an excellent performance by a young Christian Slater, and the rest of the cast. The whole story, every scene, each dialog, they all ring of authenticity. And the soundtrack is amazing. It might be getting old, but it doesn't feel like it.

    In a career dotted with offbeat and quirky roles Christian Slater was at his most offbeat and quirky in Pump Up The Volume. Slater plays a young transfer student from an eastern high school to a new school in Arizona. His Clark Kent persona is a mild mannered wallflower type. But his father made the mistake of giving him a short wave radio set to keep in touch with friends back east who are presumably ham radio operators. What Slater does is create his own pirate radio station and starts with another whole personality of disc jockey Harry Hardon. Slater's other self isn't Superman, he's more like a teenage version of Howard Beale from Network. He's amusing at first until one of the students commits suicide after calling in and Slater does little to discourage his intentions. That's a hard call to make, even professionals miss telltale signs of that kind of serious depression. But when Slater starts disrupting the power structure in the person of principal Annie Ross, the hunt is on with even the Federal Communications Commission brought in to track down this broadcasting felon. Imagine Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest as a school principal and you've got Ross. The main weakness of Pump Up The Volume is that Slater and Ross create the only two memorable characters. All the rest are strictly in support, we get no insights into any of the rest of the cast. But these two are memorable characters. A teenage mad prophet of the air and a school principal from hell. Pump Up The Volume is a staple for Christian Slater fans.

    Ugly American teenagers in an ugly American suburb force an ugly plastic rebellion against the ugly "authority". The music aside, this is a poor film. The story is stupid, the direction is laboured, the characters have zero depth and I ended it yawning and wondering if it was over yet. It has the none of the darkly comic moments of its supposed peers and is directed in a sub Back To The Future style without any of the genius or even coherence those films have. People claiming this as some sort of lost classic in the same vein as Heathers are just trying to make themselves look cool.

    To me, it's the perfect companion piece to Heathers. It has the same message, but this time Slater's character is the voice of reason who the audience can side with, instead of an agent of destruction... Many of the same themes are touched upon in the two films; how hard it is to be an adolescent when you feel like you're being disenfranchised, and the sense of feeling shepherded into the uniform lines of conformity that produce the obedient workers of the future. However, in contrast to the dark tone of "Heathers", "Pump up the Volume" strikes an optimistic note of people banding together to build something, rather than the savage nihilism that says to induce change, you have to completely obliterate things and start again. Ultimately, doing your best to get the message heard makes a heck of a lot more sense than simply putting a bomb under the problem, and then absolving yourself of the results.

    Some "kids" my age were defined by certain movies, namely John Hughes classics, though you probably can't get a lot of guys to admit that. The sadly underperforming Pump Up the Volume was mine. It was back in 1989 when I started taking movies more seriously, seeing them more and noticing that they'll eventually consume me. A year later, I saw my first Christian Slater movie (though, almost immediately following, I watched  and not for him  Young Guns II) as well as a "star" I would fall in love with for thereafter: Samantha Mathis, coincidentally, her first movie. I remember loving the movie, the idea, the setting  finally a teen movie that was set in my current location, Arizona, the mood, the dialogue, the music and definitely the message. What also impressed me was the nonchalant take they had on homosexuality and how the main hero, Hard Harry (Slater) was so accepting of it. (Side Note: I hadn't come out yet by this point, but this certainly helped verses all the negativity surrounding the "gay lifestyle" I heard around me.) And as independent as this was, it was certainly far before it's time. Christian Slater really plays Mark, but, in what also appealed to me, by night his "Clark Kent" image of Mark was transformed into the "Superman" Hard Harry on a radio program on an unused frequency. What he was doing would be considered a podcast nowadays, only he went the long, and probably only, way around it. Literally, he didn't think anyone was listening. So this lonely kid, Mark, who was moved by his parents to a small Arizona town, babbles on the air about how bad the high school he was attending as well as the small town. Although, it sounds like he's complaining, he's actually hitting on some direct topics the parents and school board are either ignoring or were ignorant of. Well, the kids are listening, one by one, growing by the night. Namely, Nora (Mathis), the obvious "Lois Lane" of the trio of characters (if you count Clark and Supe as two), who's trying to find the identity of the voice she hears and absolutely agrees with. Oh, and is it obvious she's also in love with Hard Harry? A tragedy, one you might not expect with the direction the movie was headed, occurs and now Hard Harry's a target for parents, police, the FCC and of course the school board for what he's saying might actually be true. They all want him shut down. Naturally, all the kids want him to continue  he's their voice, each and every one of them. Only, Clark, er, Mark's conflicted and the much more shy version of Hard Harry. Leave it to Lois, er, Nora, to save the day once again by giving the real hero a backbone. I rated this with the highest rating I give: 10/10 stars. I do this for nostalgia purposes, obviously, but re-watching this movie now, after not seeing it for probably 15+ years, it really holds up today. Sure, the one message (revealed in the end) of why the school board is wronging the students is somewhat weak, the dozens of others thoroughly outweigh that revolution. Also, as mentioned, I did love (literally, I fell hard for) Mathis; she did a fantastic first job and bold  see: well, her. Further, Slater equally did a excellent job. And the soundtrack remains as one of my all time favorites. I have probably listened to Everybody Knows by Concrete Blonde 660 times since this came out. This was the un-Hollywood independent film I will cherish for all time. It wasn't splashy, it was intentionally small, it was tight and it was right. All that I wrote above about my first impressions back in 1990 hold up and I stand by them. Watch this movie and know what it was TRULY like being a teen in the early nineties.

    I like the movie, "Pump Up the Volume", it's a good movie in the decade right now in 2011, this is my favorite film still, Christian Slater's brilliant performance in this 1990 comedy/drama, Slater played as Mark Hunter, a shy high school student who's a independent and quiet young student, but at night he became pirate radio VJ, Hard Harry, and Hard Harry had a voice sound like Jack Nicholson, Samantha Mathis in her film debut as Nora, Nora is sweet, but she is wild, the soundtrack in the movie is great, I like the songs in the film including Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows, Ice-T, Beastie Boys, and Was Not Was' Dad, I'm in Jail, and the songs also was featured in the soundtrack album also including artists like Soundgraden, Liquid Jesus, Sonic Youth, Above The Law, Peter Murphy, and more, Plot is great, I like this movie a lot.

    Pump Up The Volume stars Christian Slater as Mark, a shy high schooler who has an alter ego. In the evenings, he broadcasts from some equipment set up in his parents basement, creating a radio persona named "Hard Harry." He is wild and profane, but talks honestly about that things that bother him as a young adult. Eventally, his classmates begin to discover his broadcast, and the word spreads among them until he is a local phenomenon. Except that no one knows who it is saying all these things, because Mark is quiet and timid in class. He starts talking about some of the questionable practices going on at his school, which gets the attention of the administration and eventually the authorities. The pressure builds as more kids rely on "Harry" for direction, and more adults are trying to find him and shut him down. It eventually ends with the principal of the school being exposed and fired, just as Harry is discovered and apprehended. We are left to make our own assumptions as to how the student body will respond and move forward now that Harry is off the air. I was pretty apathetic about this story. I didn't find it all that memorable. I think the stuff I enjoyed most was the inspirational parts of Harry's broadcast (mixed in with scatological humor). I thought a lot of it was well written, although not really believable dialog for a high school student. If I had seen this movie when it came out, it might hold some nostalgic value. Watching it for the first time this year, it didn't do much for me.

    So many movies echo of the days of youth such as Stand By Me, The Outsiders, and The Breakfast Club, but do they really speak to us? Is there one with such a strong, powerful voice that will pull us to our feet, open our eyes, and touch our soul? Is there one, who could talk on and talk hard, holding the world in the sway of his words and in the depth of his heart? What is it in a voice that captivates us? Is it the actor breathing life into fiction or the storyline filled with drama? Either way, we are listening, and the power of speech plays on in the movie, Pump Up The Volume. And Pink Floyd said it best, "For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to talk."

The story is stupid, the direction is laboured, the characters have zero depth and I ended it yawning and wondering if it was over yet. It has the none of the darkly comic moments of its supposed peers and is directed in a sub Back To The Future style without any of the genius or even coherence those films have. People claiming this as some sort of lost classic in the same vein as Heathers are just trying to make themselves look cool.

    To me, it's the perfect companion piece to Heathers. It has the same message, but this time Slater's character is the voice of reason who the audience can side with, instead of an agent of destruction... Many of the same themes are touched upon in the two films; how hard it is to be an adolescent when you feel like you're being disenfranchised, and the sense of feeling shepherded into the uniform lines of conformity that produce the obedient workers of the future. However, in contrast to the dark tone of "Heathers", "Pump up the Volume" strikes an optimistic note of people banding together to build something, rather than the savage nihilism that says to induce change, you have to completely obliterate things and start again. Ultimately, doing your best to get the message heard makes a heck of a lot more sense than simply putting a bomb under the problem, and then absolving yourself of the results.

    Some "kids" my age were defined by certain movies, namely John Hughes classics, though you probably can't get a lot of guys to admit that. The sadly underperforming Pump Up the Volume was mine. It was back in 1989 when I started taking movies more seriously, seeing them more and noticing that they'll eventually consume me. A year later, I saw my first Christian Slater movie (though, almost immediately following, I watched  and not for him  Young Guns II) as well as a "star" I would fall in love with for thereafter: Samantha Mathis, coincidentally, her first movie. I remember loving the movie, the idea, the setting  finally a teen movie that was set in my current location, Arizona, the mood, the dialogue, the music and definitely the message. What also impressed me was the nonchalant take they had on homosexuality and how the main hero, Hard Harry (Slater) was so accepting of it. (Side Note: I hadn't come out yet by this point, but this certainly helped verses all the negativity surrounding the "gay lifestyle" I heard around me.) And as independent as this was, it was certainly far before it's time. Christian Slater really plays Mark, but, in what also appealed to me, by night his "Clark Kent" image of Mark was transformed into the "Superman" Hard Harry on a radio program on an unused frequency. What he was doing would be considered a podcast nowadays, only he went the long, and probably only, way around it. Literally, he didn't think anyone was listening. So this lonely kid, Mark, who was moved by his parents to a small Arizona town, babbles on the air about how bad the high school he was attending as well as the small town. Although, it sounds like he's complaining, he's actually hitting on some direct topics the parents and school board are either ignoring or were ignorant of. Well, the kids are listening, one by one, growing by the night. Namely, Nora (Mathis), the obvious "Lois Lane" of the trio of characters (if you count Clark and Supe as two), who's trying to find the identity of the voice she hears and absolutely agrees with. Oh, and is it obvious she's also in love with Hard Harry? A tragedy, one you might not expect with the direction the movie was headed, occurs and now Hard Harry's a target for parents, police, the FCC and of course the school board for what he's saying might actually be true. They all want him shut down. Naturally, all the kids want him to continue  he's their voice, each and every one of them. Only, Clark, er, Mark's conflicted and the much more shy version of Hard Harry. Leave it to Lois, er, Nora, to save the day once again by giving the real hero a backbone. I rated this with the highest rating I give: 10/10 stars. I do this for nostalgia purposes, obviously, but re-watching this movie now, after not seeing it for probably 15+ years, it really holds up today. Sure, the one message (revealed in the end) of why the school board is wronging the students is somewhat weak, the dozens of others thoroughly outweigh that revolution. Also, as mentioned, I did love (literally, I fell hard for) Mathis; she did a fantastic first job and bold  see: well, her. Further, Slater equally did a excellent job. And the soundtrack remains as one of my all time favorites. I have probably listened to Everybody Knows by Concrete Blonde 660 times since this came out. This was the un-Hollywood independent film I will cherish for all time. It wasn't splashy, it was intentionally small, it was tight and it was right. All that I wrote above about my first impressions back in 1990 hold up and I stand by them. Watch this movie and know what it was TRULY like being a teen in the early nineties.

    I like the movie, "Pump Up the Volume", it's a good movie in the decade right now in 2011, this is my favorite film still, Christian Slater's brilliant performance in this 1990 comedy/drama, Slater played as Mark Hunter, a shy high school student who's a independent and quiet young student, but at night he became pirate radio VJ, Hard Harry, and Hard Harry had a voice sound like Jack Nicholson, Samantha Mathis in her film debut as Nora, Nora is sweet, but she is wild, the soundtrack in the movie is great, I like the songs in the film including Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows, Ice-T, Beastie Boys, and Was Not Was' Dad, I'm in Jail, and the songs also was featured in the soundtrack album also including artists like Soundgraden, Liquid Jesus, Sonic Youth, Above The Law, Peter Murphy, and more, Plot is great, I like this movie a lot.

    Pump Up The Volume stars Christian Slater as Mark, a shy high schooler who has an alter ego. In the evenings, he broadcasts from some equipment set up in his parents basement, creating a radio persona named "Hard Harry." He is wild and profane, but talks honestly about that things that bother him as a young adult. Eventally, his classmates begin to discover his broadcast, and the word spreads among them until he is a local phenomenon. Except that no one knows who it is saying all these things, because Mark is quiet and timid in class. He starts talking about some of the questionable practices going on at his school, which gets the attention of the administration and eventually the authorities. The pressure builds as more kids rely on "Harry" for direction, and more adults are trying to find him and shut him down. It eventually ends with the principal of the school being exposed and fired, just as Harry is discovered and apprehended. We are left to make our own assumptions as to how the student body will respond and move forward now that Harry is off the air. I was pretty apathetic about this story. I didn't find it all that memorable. I think the stuff I enjoyed most was the inspirational parts of Harry's broadcast (mixed in with scatological humor). I thought a lot of it was well written, although not really believable dialog for a high school student. If I had seen this movie when it came out, it might hold some nostalgic value. Watching it for the first time this year, it didn't do much for me.

    So many movies echo of the days of youth such as Stand By Me, The Outsiders, and The Breakfast Club, but do they really speak to us? Is there one with such a strong, powerful voice that will pull us to our feet, open our eyes, and touch our soul? Is there one, who could talk on and talk hard, holding the world in the sway of his words and in the depth of his heart? What is it in a voice that captivates us? Is it the actor breathing life into fiction or the storyline filled with drama? Either way, we are listening, and the power of speech plays on in the movie, Pump Up The Volume. And Pink Floyd said it best, "For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to talk."

    Christian Slater plays Mark Hunter, a shy teenager who has just moved from the East coast to Arizona. His parents give him a short wave radio set that he turns into a pirate radio station where his shyness evaporates, and instead he uses the handle "Hard Harry", where he vents his frustrations and confusions to his fellow teenagers, who it turns out are very receptive to this message, and "Hard Harry" finds himself the most popular and influential person in town, much to his high school principal's consternation. Things take a dark turn when a troubled teenage listener commits suicide, and the authorities become eager to shut down his illegal broadcasts. Smart and appealing film has a fine performance from Christian Slater, that really speaks to the hearts and minds of teenagers, and still rings true. Dramatically uneven, but will resonate strongly with people who like to listen to talk radio.

    "Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religions destroy spirituality." - Michael Ellner Alan Moyle's "Pump Up The Volume" stars Christian Slater as Mark Hunter, a high school student who lives in a sleepy, Arizonan town. Looking to lash out at the world, Mark starts an FM pirate radio station. This station becomes an outlet for his angst and aggression. The film then becomes a teen version of "Network" or "Rebel Without a Cause", Mark rallying fellow disaffected and alienated youths until he becomes the unwitting leader of a minor student revolution. In historical terms, Hunter's caught in the deadlock of late capitalism, or what Francis Fukuyama called "the end of history", a time populated by what Nietzsche called "the last men"; pathetic, contemptible things. Fukuyama's position counterpointed that of Hegel and Marx, who saw historical development as a purposeful journey from primitive stages of consciousness to "something better". This goes against the "there is no alternative" (T.I.N.A) mantra of late capitalism, a stance explicitly reborn in the mid 20th century, but which has bee around in various forms much longer, perhaps starting with Thomas Malthus, a nineteenth century progenitor of "no alternative" politics and its credo of "permanent" scarcity and "necessary poverty". Malthus contested nineteenth century radicals who were steadfast in their belief that labour, properly deployed, could usher in a new society. Indeed, the initial need for elites to publicly announce the absence of any alternative to existing social arrangements was entirely a defensive move, in response to such radical ideas. One of the first to counter T.I.N.A was William Godwin. In his 1793 book, "Enquiry Concerning Political Justice", he argued that the "existing state creates a servile and truckling spirit," and that the cruel monotony of the system "produces a kind of stupid and hopeless vacancy in every face". From Godwin can be drawn a line to libertarians, anarchist communism, socialism and even the labour theory of value. The British government then tried to prosecute Godwin for treason, but abandoned the idea. Godwin was instead attacked by Malthus, who in "Principles of Political Economy" essentially defended class structures and even went so far as to advocate starving the poor because "that way they wouldn't breed too heavily". In anticipation of the permanent war economy of the United States, Malthus would even offer war and state debt as perfect mechanisms for "enhancing value through the careful calibration of scarcity". So though white and privileged, Hunter's part of a long list of validly ticked off people. On air he calls himself "Hard Harry", and begins his radio program with Leonard Cohen's "Everybody Knows", the lyrics "everybody knows the dice are loaded, everybody rolls with their fingers crossed" heralding his audio rants. "All the great themes have been used up and turned into theme parks," he tells his audience, as he begins to develop a sort of naive political manifesto. Where adults condescend, he empathises, where they ignore, he provides an outlet for the hopes, dreams, fears and tragedies of other youths. Elsewhere Hunter challenges the ethos of his college, which cares more about test scores and image than actual education. Unsurprisingly, his college is named after Hubert Humphrey, a despicable archetype of cold war neoliberalism and apologist for much violence (Vietnam, the police beatings of peace activists etc). "The truth is a virus," Hunter tells his listeners, as he becomes increasingly subversive and empowering, shaking fellow students out of apathy. "It begins with us! Not the experts, but the ones who need it most!" Pretty soon he's changed from an object of hero worship to one of strategic appropriation, youths taking from him what they need to advance their own empowerment and emancipation. Elsewhere the songs he plays are politically charged, but in offbeat ways. There's "Freedom of Speech" by Above the Law, Ice T states "I've no time to whisper in your ear", Hunter plays "Wave of Mutilation" by the Pixies, has Soundgarden say "Accused and convicted for nothing" and Liquid Jesus "Stand, and they will make you crawl". "Nothing is more important than a good education!" adults tell Hunter. "Except the basic right to it," he counters. Slowly he moves from isolation and individualism to community and collective action. He accepts that he has a responsibility to his listeners, understands that meaning and expression are terrains of political contestation, repeatedly fought over, but then quickly finds himself chased by the police and FBI. They want to shut him down. To silence him. The film ends with Harry on the run, romantic engagement finally deemed inadequate, until a final sequence in which every student in America starts their own pirate radio station. This is offered as something positive, but the internet/Facebook generation's told us otherwise: the podiums afforded by technology increase atomization and tend to become just more outlets for narcissism. Traditionally, young people have energised democratic movements. But resistance to domination has been subdued and power has long created societal institutions designed to break resistance. The young, reflexively impotent, are perhaps now entirely acquiesced to the idea that they can and will be repeatedly screwed. Large debts, and the fear they create, have become a pacifying force. Elsewhere we psychopathologize and medicate noncompliance, a fact which led Erich Fromm to state that "today the function of psychiatry and medicine threatens to become the tool in the manipulation of man." Indeed, schools themselves inculcate compliance not democracy, and routinely traffic standardisation and fear. The intelligent are shamed, surveillance is normalised and fundamentalist Religion and Fundamentalist Consumerism are exalted above all things. And so, like Howard Beale, Hunter yells from a radio, before being shut down. 8.9/10  One of the best teen movies of the 1990s, despite a weak, corny third act.

    Pump Up the Volume might have been the true opening salvo of the 90s, and the voice of Generation X, but it speaks to every teen of every generation. It is about raising your voice, being heard, but only with the advent of the Internet was its dream fully realized. This is the type of movie that will make you want to write your own blog, make a video journal, or do a podcast. It has that quality that grip people attention and make them do things worthwhile with their lives. It's an excellent performance by a young Christian Slater, and the rest of the cast. The whole story, every scene, each dialog, they all ring of authenticity. And the soundtrack is amazing. It might be getting old, but it doesn't feel like it.

    In a career dotted with offbeat and quirky roles Christian Slater was at his most offbeat and quirky in Pump Up The Volume. Slater plays a young transfer student from an eastern high school to a new school in Arizona. His Clark Kent persona is a mild mannered wallflower type. But his father made the mistake of giving him a short wave radio set to keep in touch with friends back east who are presumably ham radio operators. What Slater does is create his own pirate radio station and starts with another whole personality of disc jockey Harry Hardon. Slater's other self isn't Superman, he's more like a teenage version of Howard Beale from Network. He's amusing at first until one of the students commits suicide after calling in and Slater does little to discourage his intentions. That's a hard call to make, even professionals miss telltale signs of that kind of serious depression. But when Slater starts disrupting the power structure in the person of principal Annie Ross, the hunt is on with even the Federal Communications Commission brought in to track down this broadcasting felon. Imagine Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest as a school principal and you've got Ross. The main weakness of Pump Up The Volume is that Slater and Ross create the only two memorable characters. All the rest are strictly in support, we get no insights into any of the rest of the cast. But these two are memorable characters. A teenage mad prophet of the air and a school principal from hell. Pump Up The Volume is a staple for Christian Slater fans.

    To me, it's the perfect companion piece to Heathers. It has the same message, but this time Slater's character is the voice of reason who the audience can side with, instead of an agent of destruction... Many of the same themes are touched upon in the two films; how hard it is to be an adolescent when you feel like you're being disenfranchised, and the sense of feeling shepherded into the uniform lines of conformity that produce the obedient workers of the future. However, in contrast to the dark tone of "Heathers", "Pump up the Volume" strikes an optimistic note of people banding together to build something, rather than the savage nihilism that says to induce change, you have to completely obliterate things and start again. Ultimately, doing your best to get the message heard makes a heck of a lot more sense than simply putting a bomb under the problem, and then absolving yourself of the results.

The film then becomes a teen version of "Network" or "Rebel Without a Cause", Mark rallying fellow disaffected and alienated youths until he becomes the unwitting leader of a minor student revolution. In historical terms, Hunter's caught in the deadlock of late capitalism, or what Francis Fukuyama called "the end of history", a time populated by what Nietzsche called "the last men"; pathetic, contemptible things. Fukuyama's position counterpointed that of Hegel and Marx, who saw historical development as a purposeful journey from primitive stages of consciousness to "something better". This goes against the "there is no alternative" (T.I.N.A) mantra of late capitalism, a stance explicitly reborn in the mid 20th century, but which has bee around in various forms much longer, perhaps starting with Thomas Malthus, a nineteenth century progenitor of "no alternative" politics and its credo of "permanent" scarcity and "necessary poverty". Malthus contested nineteenth century radicals who were steadfast in their belief that labour, properly deployed, could usher in a new society. Indeed, the initial need for elites to publicly announce the absence of any alternative to existing social arrangements was entirely a defensive move, in response to such radical ideas. One of the first to counter T.I.N.A was William Godwin. In his 1793 book, "Enquiry Concerning Political Justice", he argued that the "existing state creates a servile and truckling spirit," and that the cruel monotony of the system "produces a kind of stupid and hopeless vacancy in every face". From Godwin can be drawn a line to libertarians, anarchist communism, socialism and even the labour theory of value. The British government then tried to prosecute Godwin for treason, but abandoned the idea. Godwin was instead attacked by Malthus, who in "Principles of Political Economy" essentially defended class structures and even went so far as to advocate starving the poor because "that way they wouldn't breed too heavily". In anticipation of the permanent war economy of the United States, Malthus would even offer war and state debt as perfect mechanisms for "enhancing value through the careful calibration of scarcity". So though white and privileged, Hunter's part of a long list of validly ticked off people. On air he calls himself "Hard Harry", and begins his radio program with Leonard Cohen's "Everybody Knows", the lyrics "everybody knows the dice are loaded, everybody rolls with their fingers crossed" heralding his audio rants. "All the great themes have been used up and turned into theme parks," he tells his audience, as he begins to develop a sort of naive political manifesto. Where adults condescend, he empathises, where they ignore, he provides an outlet for the hopes, dreams, fears and tragedies of other youths. Elsewhere Hunter challenges the ethos of his college, which cares more about test scores and image than actual education. Unsurprisingly, his college is named after Hubert Humphrey, a despicable archetype of cold war neoliberalism and apologist for much violence (Vietnam, the police beatings of peace activists etc). "The truth is a virus," Hunter tells his listeners, as he becomes increasingly subversive and empowering, shaking fellow students out of apathy. "It begins with us! Not the experts, but the ones who need it most!" Pretty soon he's changed from an object of hero worship to one of strategic appropriation, youths taking from him what they need to advance their own empowerment and emancipation. Elsewhere the songs he plays are politically charged, but in offbeat ways. There's "Freedom of Speech" by Above the Law, Ice T states "I've no time to whisper in your ear", Hunter plays "Wave of Mutilation" by the Pixies, has Soundgarden say "Accused and convicted for nothing" and Liquid Jesus "Stand, and they will make you crawl". "Nothing is more important than a good education!" adults tell Hunter. "Except the basic right to it," he counters. Slowly he moves from isolation and individualism to community and collective action. He accepts that he has a responsibility to his listeners, understands that meaning and expression are terrains of political contestation, repeatedly fought over, but then quickly finds himself chased by the police and FBI. They want to shut him down. To silence him. The film ends with Harry on the run, romantic engagement finally deemed inadequate, until a final sequence in which every student in America starts their own pirate radio station. This is offered as something positive, but the internet/Facebook generation's told us otherwise: the podiums afforded by technology increase atomization and tend to become just more outlets for narcissism. Traditionally, young people have energised democratic movements. But resistance to domination has been subdued and power has long created societal institutions designed to break resistance. The young, reflexively impotent, are perhaps now entirely acquiesced to the idea that they can and will be repeatedly screwed. Large debts, and the fear they create, have become a pacifying force. Elsewhere we psychopathologize and medicate noncompliance, a fact which led Erich Fromm to state that "today the function of psychiatry and medicine threatens to become the tool in the manipulation of man." Indeed, schools themselves inculcate compliance not democracy, and routinely traffic standardisation and fear. The intelligent are shamed, surveillance is normalised and fundamentalist Religion and Fundamentalist Consumerism are exalted above all things. And so, like Howard Beale, Hunter yells from a radio, before being shut down. 8.9/10  One of the best teen movies of the 1990s, despite a weak, corny third act.

    Pump Up the Volume might have been the true opening salvo of the 90s, and the voice of Generation X, but it speaks to every teen of every generation. It is about raising your voice, being heard, but only with the advent of the Internet was its dream fully realized. This is the type of movie that will make you want to write your own blog, make a video journal, or do a podcast. It has that quality that grip people attention and make them do things worthwhile with their lives. It's an excellent performance by a young Christian Slater, and the rest of the cast. The whole story, every scene, each dialog, they all ring of authenticity. And the soundtrack is amazing. It might be getting old, but it doesn't feel like it.

    In a career dotted with offbeat and quirky roles Christian Slater was at his most offbeat and quirky in Pump Up The Volume. Slater plays a young transfer student from an eastern high school to a new school in Arizona. His Clark Kent persona is a mild mannered wallflower type. But his father made the mistake of giving him a short wave radio set to keep in touch with friends back east who are presumably ham radio operators. What Slater does is create his own pirate radio station and starts with another whole personality of disc jockey Harry Hardon. Slater's other self isn't Superman, he's more like a teenage version of Howard Beale from Network. He's amusing at first until one of the students commits suicide after calling in and Slater does little to discourage his intentions. That's a hard call to make, even professionals miss telltale signs of that kind of serious depression. But when Slater starts disrupting the power structure in the person of principal Annie Ross, the hunt is on with even the Federal Communications Commission brought in to track down this broadcasting felon. Imagine Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest as a school principal and you've got Ross. The main weakness of Pump Up The Volume is that Slater and Ross create the only two memorable characters. All the rest are strictly in support, we get no insights into any of the rest of the cast. But these two are memorable characters. A teenage mad prophet of the air and a school principal from hell. Pump Up The Volume is a staple for Christian Slater fans.

    Ugly American teenagers in an ugly American suburb force an ugly plastic rebellion against the ugly "authority". The music aside, this is a poor film. The story is stupid, the direction is laboured, the characters have zero depth and I ended it yawning and wondering if it was over yet. It has the none of the darkly comic moments of its supposed peers and is directed in a sub Back To The Future style without any of the genius or even coherence those films have. People claiming this as some sort of lost classic in the same vein as Heathers are just trying to make themselves look cool.

    To me, it's the perfect companion piece to Heathers. It has the same message, but this time Slater's character is the voice of reason who the audience can side with, instead of an agent of destruction... Many of the same themes are touched upon in the two films; how hard it is to be an adolescent when you feel like you're being disenfranchised, and the sense of feeling shepherded into the uniform lines of conformity that produce the obedient workers of the future. However, in contrast to the dark tone of "Heathers", "Pump up the Volume" strikes an optimistic note of people banding together to build something, rather than the savage nihilism that says to induce change, you have to completely obliterate things and start again. Ultimately, doing your best to get the message heard makes a heck of a lot more sense than simply putting a bomb under the problem, and then absolving yourself of the results.

    Some "kids" my age were defined by certain movies, namely John Hughes classics, though you probably can't get a lot of guys to admit that. The sadly underperforming Pump Up the Volume was mine. It was back in 1989 when I started taking movies more seriously, seeing them more and noticing that they'll eventually consume me. A year later, I saw my first Christian Slater movie (though, almost immediately following, I watched  and not for him  Young Guns II) as well as a "star" I would fall in love with for thereafter: Samantha Mathis, coincidentally, her first movie. I remember loving the movie, the idea, the setting  finally a teen movie that was set in my current location, Arizona, the mood, the dialogue, the music and definitely the message. What also impressed me was the nonchalant take they had on homosexuality and how the main hero, Hard Harry (Slater) was so accepting of it. (Side Note: I hadn't come out yet by this point, but this certainly helped verses all the negativity surrounding the "gay lifestyle" I heard around me.) And as independent as this was, it was certainly far before it's time. Christian Slater really plays Mark, but, in what also appealed to me, by night his "Clark Kent" image of Mark was transformed into the "Superman" Hard Harry on a radio program on an unused frequency. What he was doing would be considered a podcast nowadays, only he went the long, and probably only, way around it. Literally, he didn't think anyone was listening. So this lonely kid, Mark, who was moved by his parents to a small Arizona town, babbles on the air about how bad the high school he was attending as well as the small town. Although, it sounds like he's complaining, he's actually hitting on some direct topics the parents and school board are either ignoring or were ignorant of. Well, the kids are listening, one by one, growing by the night. Namely, Nora (Mathis), the obvious "Lois Lane" of the trio of characters (if you count Clark and Supe as two), who's trying to find the identity of the voice she hears and absolutely agrees with. Oh, and is it obvious she's also in love with Hard Harry? A tragedy, one you might not expect with the direction the movie was headed, occurs and now Hard Harry's a target for parents, police, the FCC and of course the school board for what he's saying might actually be true. They all want him shut down. Naturally, all the kids want him to continue  he's their voice, each and every one of them. Only, Clark, er, Mark's conflicted and the much more shy version of Hard Harry. Leave it to Lois, er, Nora, to save the day once again by giving the real hero a backbone. I rated this with the highest rating I give: 10/10 stars. I do this for nostalgia purposes, obviously, but re-watching this movie now, after not seeing it for probably 15+ years, it really holds up today. Sure, the one message (revealed in the end) of why the school board is wronging the students is somewhat weak, the dozens of others thoroughly outweigh that revolution. Also, as mentioned, I did love (literally, I fell hard for) Mathis; she did a fantastic first job and bold  see: well, her. Further, Slater equally did a excellent job. And the soundtrack remains as one of my all time favorites. I have probably listened to Everybody Knows by Concrete Blonde 660 times since this came out. This was the un-Hollywood independent film I will cherish for all time. It wasn't splashy, it was intentionally small, it was tight and it was right. All that I wrote above about my first impressions back in 1990 hold up and I stand by them. Watch this movie and know what it was TRULY like being a teen in the early nineties.

    I like the movie, "Pump Up the Volume", it's a good movie in the decade right now in 2011, this is my favorite film still, Christian Slater's brilliant performance in this 1990 comedy/drama, Slater played as Mark Hunter, a shy high school student who's a independent and quiet young student, but at night he became pirate radio VJ, Hard Harry, and Hard Harry had a voice sound like Jack Nicholson, Samantha Mathis in her film debut as Nora, Nora is sweet, but she is wild, the soundtrack in the movie is great, I like the songs in the film including Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows, Ice-T, Beastie Boys, and Was Not Was' Dad, I'm in Jail, and the songs also was featured in the soundtrack album also including artists like Soundgraden, Liquid Jesus, Sonic Youth, Above The Law, Peter Murphy, and more, Plot is great, I like this movie a lot.

    Pump Up The Volume stars Christian Slater as Mark, a shy high schooler who has an alter ego. In the evenings, he broadcasts from some equipment set up in his parents basement, creating a radio persona named "Hard Harry." He is wild and profane, but talks honestly about that things that bother him as a young adult. Eventally, his classmates begin to discover his broadcast, and the word spreads among them until he is a local phenomenon. Except that no one knows who it is saying all these things, because Mark is quiet and timid in class. He starts talking about some of the questionable practices going on at his school, which gets the attention of the administration and eventually the authorities. The pressure builds as more kids rely on "Harry" for direction, and more adults are trying to find him and shut him down. It eventually ends with the principal of the school being exposed and fired, just as Harry is discovered and apprehended. We are left to make our own assumptions as to how the student body will respond and move forward now that Harry is off the air. I was pretty apathetic about this story. I didn't find it all that memorable. I think the stuff I enjoyed most was the inspirational parts of Harry's broadcast (mixed in with scatological humor). I thought a lot of it was well written, although not really believable dialog for a high school student. If I had seen this movie when it came out, it might hold some nostalgic value. Watching it for the first time this year, it didn't do much for me.

    So many movies echo of the days of youth such as Stand By Me, The Outsiders, and The Breakfast Club, but do they really speak to us? Is there one with such a strong, powerful voice that will pull us to our feet, open our eyes, and touch our soul? Is there one, who could talk on and talk hard, holding the world in the sway of his words and in the depth of his heart? What is it in a voice that captivates us? Is it the actor breathing life into fiction or the storyline filled with drama? Either way, we are listening, and the power of speech plays on in the movie, Pump Up The Volume. And Pink Floyd said it best, "For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to talk."

    Christian Slater plays Mark Hunter, a shy teenager who has just moved from the East coast to Arizona. His parents give him a short wave radio set that he turns into a pirate radio station where his shyness evaporates, and instead he uses the handle "Hard Harry", where he vents his frustrations and confusions to his fellow teenagers, who it turns out are very receptive to this message, and "Hard Harry" finds himself the most popular and influential person in town, much to his high school principal's consternation. Things take a dark turn when a troubled teenage listener commits suicide, and the authorities become eager to shut down his illegal broadcasts. Smart and appealing film has a fine performance from Christian Slater, that really speaks to the hearts and minds of teenagers, and still rings true. Dramatically uneven, but will resonate strongly with people who like to listen to talk radio.

    "Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religions destroy spirituality." - Michael Ellner Alan Moyle's "Pump Up The Volume" stars Christian Slater as Mark Hunter, a high school student who lives in a sleepy, Arizonan town. Looking to lash out at the world, Mark starts an FM pirate radio station. This station becomes an outlet for his angst and aggression. The film then becomes a teen version of "Network" or "Rebel Without a Cause", Mark rallying fellow disaffected and alienated youths until he becomes the unwitting leader of a minor student revolution. In historical terms, Hunter's caught in the deadlock of late capitalism, or what Francis Fukuyama called "the end of history", a time populated by what Nietzsche called "the last men"; pathetic, contemptible things. Fukuyama's position counterpointed that of Hegel and Marx, who saw historical development as a purposeful journey from primitive stages of consciousness to "something better". This goes against the "there is no alternative" (T.I.N.A) mantra of late capitalism, a stance explicitly reborn in the mid 20th century, but which has bee around in various forms much longer, perhaps starting with Thomas Malthus, a nineteenth century progenitor of "no alternative" politics and its credo of "permanent" scarcity and "necessary poverty". Malthus contested nineteenth century radicals who were steadfast in their belief that labour, properly deployed, could usher in a new society. Indeed, the initial need for elites to publicly announce the absence of any alternative to existing social arrangements was entirely a defensive move, in response to such radical ideas. One of the first to counter T.I.N.A was William Godwin. In his 1793 book, "Enquiry Concerning Political Justice", he argued that the "existing state creates a servile and truckling spirit," and that the cruel monotony of the system "produces a kind of stupid and hopeless vacancy in every face". From Godwin can be drawn a line to libertarians, anarchist communism, socialism and even the labour theory of value. The British government then tried to prosecute Godwin for treason, but abandoned the idea. Godwin was instead attacked by Malthus, who in "Principles of Political Economy" essentially defended class structures and even went so far as to advocate starving the poor because "that way they wouldn't breed too heavily". In anticipation of the permanent war economy of the United States, Malthus would even offer war and state debt as perfect mechanisms for "enhancing value through the careful calibration of scarcity". So though white and privileged, Hunter's part of a long list of validly ticked off people. On air he calls himself "Hard Harry", and begins his radio program with Leonard Cohen's "Everybody Knows", the lyrics "everybody knows the dice are loaded, everybody rolls with their fingers crossed" heralding his audio rants. "All the great themes have been used up and turned into theme parks," he tells his audience, as he begins to develop a sort of naive political manifesto. Where adults condescend, he empathises, where they ignore, he provides an outlet for the hopes, dreams, fears and tragedies of other youths. Elsewhere Hunter challenges the ethos of his college, which cares more about test scores and image than actual education. Unsurprisingly, his college is named after Hubert Humphrey, a despicable archetype of cold war neoliberalism and apologist for much violence (Vietnam, the police beatings of peace activists etc). "The truth is a virus," Hunter tells his listeners, as he becomes increasingly subversive and empowering, shaking fellow students out of apathy. "It begins with us! Not the experts, but the ones who need it most!" Pretty soon he's changed from an object of hero worship to one of strategic appropriation, youths taking from him what they need to advance their own empowerment and emancipation. Elsewhere the songs he plays are politically charged, but in offbeat ways. There's "Freedom of Speech" by Above the Law, Ice T states "I've no time to whisper in your ear", Hunter plays "Wave of Mutilation" by the Pixies, has Soundgarden say "Accused and convicted for nothing" and Liquid Jesus "Stand, and they will make you crawl". "Nothing is more important than a good education!" adults tell Hunter. "Except the basic right to it," he counters. Slowly he moves from isolation and individualism to community and collective action. He accepts that he has a responsibility to his listeners, understands that meaning and expression are terrains of political contestation, repeatedly fought over, but then quickly finds himself chased by the police and FBI. They want to shut him down. To silence him. The film ends with Harry on the run, romantic engagement finally deemed inadequate, until a final sequence in which every student in America starts their own pirate radio station. This is offered as something positive, but the internet/Facebook generation's told us otherwise: the podiums afforded by technology increase atomization and tend to become just more outlets for narcissism. Traditionally, young people have energised democratic movements. But resistance to domination has been subdued and power has long created societal institutions designed to break resistance. The young, reflexively impotent, are perhaps now entirely acquiesced to the idea that they can and will be repeatedly screwed. Large debts, and the fear they create, have become a pacifying force. Elsewhere we psychopathologize and medicate noncompliance, a fact which led Erich Fromm to state that "today the function of psychiatry and medicine threatens to become the tool in the manipulation of man." Indeed, schools themselves inculcate compliance not democracy, and routinely traffic standardisation and fear. The intelligent are shamed, surveillance is normalised and fundamentalist Religion and Fundamentalist Consumerism are exalted above all things. And so, like Howard Beale, Hunter yells from a radio, before being shut down. 8.9/10  One of the best teen movies of the 1990s, despite a weak, corny third act.

    To me, it's the perfect companion piece to Heathers. It has the same message, but this time Slater's character is the voice of reason who the audience can side with, instead of an agent of destruction... Many of the same themes are touched upon in the two films; how hard it is to be an adolescent when you feel like you're being disenfranchised, and the sense of feeling shepherded into the uniform lines of conformity that produce the obedient workers of the future. However, in contrast to the dark tone of "Heathers", "Pump up the Volume" strikes an optimistic note of people banding together to build something, rather than the savage nihilism that says to induce change, you have to completely obliterate things and start again. Ultimately, doing your best to get the message heard makes a heck of a lot more sense than simply putting a bomb under the problem, and then absolving yourself of the results.

I remember loving the movie, the idea, the setting  finally a teen movie that was set in my current location, Arizona, the mood, the dialogue, the music and definitely the message.

They all want him shut down. Naturally, all the kids want him to continue  he's their voice, each and every one of them. Only, Clark, er, Mark's conflicted and the much more shy version of Hard Harry. Leave it to Lois, er, Nora, to save the day once again by giving the real hero a backbone. I rated this with the highest rating I give: 10/10 stars. I do this for nostalgia purposes, obviously, but re-watching this movie now, after not seeing it for probably 15+ years, it really holds up today. Sure, the one message (revealed in the end) of why the school board is wronging the students is somewhat weak, the dozens of others thoroughly outweigh that revolution. Also, as mentioned, I did love (literally, I fell hard for) Mathis; she did a fantastic first job and bold  see: well, her. Further, Slater equally did a excellent job. And the soundtrack remains as one of my all time favorites. I have probably listened to Everybody Knows by Concrete Blonde 660 times since this came out. This was the un-Hollywood independent film I will cherish for all time. It wasn't splashy, it was intentionally small, it was tight and it was right. All that I wrote above about my first impressions back in 1990 hold up and I stand by them. Watch this movie and know what it was TRULY like being a teen in the early nineties.

    I like the movie, "Pump Up the Volume", it's a good movie in the decade right now in 2011, this is my favorite film still, Christian Slater's brilliant performance in this 1990 comedy/drama, Slater played as Mark Hunter, a shy high school student who's a independent and quiet young student, but at night he became pirate radio VJ, Hard Harry, and Hard Harry had a voice sound like Jack Nicholson, Samantha Mathis in her film debut as Nora, Nora is sweet, but she is wild, the soundtrack in the movie is great, I like the songs in the film including Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows, Ice-T, Beastie Boys, and Was Not Was' Dad, I'm in Jail, and the songs also was featured in the soundtrack album also including artists like Soundgraden, Liquid Jesus, Sonic Youth, Above The Law, Peter Murphy, and more, Plot is great, I like this movie a lot.

    Pump Up The Volume stars Christian Slater as Mark, a shy high schooler who has an alter ego. In the evenings, he broadcasts from some equipment set up in his parents basement, creating a radio persona named "Hard Harry." He is wild and profane, but talks honestly about that things that bother him as a young adult. Eventally, his classmates begin to discover his broadcast, and the word spreads among them until he is a local phenomenon. Except that no one knows who it is saying all these things, because Mark is quiet and timid in class. He starts talking about some of the questionable practices going on at his school, which gets the attention of the administration and eventually the authorities. The pressure builds as more kids rely on "Harry" for direction, and more adults are trying to find him and shut him down. It eventually ends with the principal of the school being exposed and fired, just as Harry is discovered and apprehended. We are left to make our own assumptions as to how the student body will respond and move forward now that Harry is off the air. I was pretty apathetic about this story. I didn't find it all that memorable. I think the stuff I enjoyed most was the inspirational parts of Harry's broadcast (mixed in with scatological humor). I thought a lot of it was well written, although not really believable dialog for a high school student. If I had seen this movie when it came out, it might hold some nostalgic value. Watching it for the first time this year, it didn't do much for me.

    So many movies echo of the days of youth such as Stand By Me, The Outsiders, and The Breakfast Club, but do they really speak to us? Is there one with such a strong, powerful voice that will pull us to our feet, open our eyes, and touch our soul? Is there one, who could talk on and talk hard, holding the world in the sway of his words and in the depth of his heart? What is it in a voice that captivates us? Is it the actor breathing life into fiction or the storyline filled with drama? Either way, we are listening, and the power of speech plays on in the movie, Pump Up The Volume. And Pink Floyd said it best, "For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to talk."

    Christian Slater plays Mark Hunter, a shy teenager who has just moved from the East coast to Arizona. His parents give him a short wave radio set that he turns into a pirate radio station where his shyness evaporates, and instead he uses the handle "Hard Harry", where he vents his frustrations and confusions to his fellow teenagers, who it turns out are very receptive to this message, and "Hard Harry" finds himself the most popular and influential person in town, much to his high school principal's consternation. Things take a dark turn when a troubled teenage listener commits suicide, and the authorities become eager to shut down his illegal broadcasts. Smart and appealing film has a fine performance from Christian Slater, that really speaks to the hearts and minds of teenagers, and still rings true. Dramatically uneven, but will resonate strongly with people who like to listen to talk radio.

    "Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religions destroy spirituality." - Michael Ellner Alan Moyle's "Pump Up The Volume" stars Christian Slater as Mark Hunter, a high school student who lives in a sleepy, Arizonan town. Looking to lash out at the world, Mark starts an FM pirate radio station. This station becomes an outlet for his angst and aggression. The film then becomes a teen version of "Network" or "Rebel Without a Cause", Mark rallying fellow disaffected and alienated youths until he becomes the unwitting leader of a minor student revolution. In historical terms, Hunter's caught in the deadlock of late capitalism, or what Francis Fukuyama called "the end of history", a time populated by what Nietzsche called "the last men"; pathetic, contemptible things. Fukuyama's position counterpointed that of Hegel and Marx, who saw historical development as a purposeful journey from primitive stages of consciousness to "something better". This goes against the "there is no alternative" (T.I.N.A) mantra of late capitalism, a stance explicitly reborn in the mid 20th century, but which has bee around in various forms much longer, perhaps starting with Thomas Malthus, a nineteenth century progenitor of "no alternative" politics and its credo of "permanent" scarcity and "necessary poverty". Malthus contested nineteenth century radicals who were steadfast in their belief that labour, properly deployed, could usher in a new society. Indeed, the initial need for elites to publicly announce the absence of any alternative to existing social arrangements was entirely a defensive move, in response to such radical ideas. One of the first to counter T.I.N.A was William Godwin. In his 1793 book, "Enquiry Concerning Political Justice", he argued that the "existing state creates a servile and truckling spirit," and that the cruel monotony of the system "produces a kind of stupid and hopeless vacancy in every face". From Godwin can be drawn a line to libertarians, anarchist communism, socialism and even the labour theory of value. The British government then tried to prosecute Godwin for treason, but abandoned the idea. Godwin was instead attacked by Malthus, who in "Principles of Political Economy" essentially defended class structures and even went so far as to advocate starving the poor because "that way they wouldn't breed too heavily". In anticipation of the permanent war economy of the United States, Malthus would even offer war and state debt as perfect mechanisms for "enhancing value through the careful calibration of scarcity". So though white and privileged, Hunter's part of a long list of validly ticked off people. On air he calls himself "Hard Harry", and begins his radio program with Leonard Cohen's "Everybody Knows", the lyrics "everybody knows the dice are loaded, everybody rolls with their fingers crossed" heralding his audio rants. "All the great themes have been used up and turned into theme parks," he tells his audience, as he begins to develop a sort of naive political manifesto. Where adults condescend, he empathises, where they ignore, he provides an outlet for the hopes, dreams, fears and tragedies of other youths. Elsewhere Hunter challenges the ethos of his college, which cares more about test scores and image than actual education. Unsurprisingly, his college is named after Hubert Humphrey, a despicable archetype of cold war neoliberalism and apologist for much violence (Vietnam, the police beatings of peace activists etc). "The truth is a virus," Hunter tells his listeners, as he becomes increasingly subversive and empowering, shaking fellow students out of apathy. "It begins with us! Not the experts, but the ones who need it most!" Pretty soon he's changed from an object of hero worship to one of strategic appropriation, youths taking from him what they need to advance their own empowerment and emancipation. Elsewhere the songs he plays are politically charged, but in offbeat ways. There's "Freedom of Speech" by Above the Law, Ice T states "I've no time to whisper in your ear", Hunter plays "Wave of Mutilation" by the Pixies, has Soundgarden say "Accused and convicted for nothing" and Liquid Jesus "Stand, and they will make you crawl". "Nothing is more important than a good education!" adults tell Hunter. "Except the basic right to it," he counters. Slowly he moves from isolation and individualism to community and collective action. He accepts that he has a responsibility to his listeners, understands that meaning and expression are terrains of political contestation, repeatedly fought over, but then quickly finds himself chased by the police and FBI. They want to shut him down. To silence him. The film ends with Harry on the run, romantic engagement finally deemed inadequate, until a final sequence in which every student in America starts their own pirate radio station. This is offered as something positive, but the internet/Facebook generation's told us otherwise: the podiums afforded by technology increase atomization and tend to become just more outlets for narcissism. Traditionally, young people have energised democratic movements. But resistance to domination has been subdued and power has long created societal institutions designed to break resistance. The young, reflexively impotent, are perhaps now entirely acquiesced to the idea that they can and will be repeatedly screwed. Large debts, and the fear they create, have become a pacifying force. Elsewhere we psychopathologize and medicate noncompliance, a fact which led Erich Fromm to state that "today the function of psychiatry and medicine threatens to become the tool in the manipulation of man." Indeed, schools themselves inculcate compliance not democracy, and routinely traffic standardisation and fear. The intelligent are shamed, surveillance is normalised and fundamentalist Religion and Fundamentalist Consumerism are exalted above all things. And so, like Howard Beale, Hunter yells from a radio, before being shut down. 8.9/10  One of the best teen movies of the 1990s, despite a weak, corny third act.

    Pump Up the Volume might have been the true opening salvo of the 90s, and the voice of Generation X, but it speaks to every teen of every generation. It is about raising your voice, being heard, but only with the advent of the Internet was its dream fully realized. This is the type of movie that will make you want to write your own blog, make a video journal, or do a podcast. It has that quality that grip people attention and make them do things worthwhile with their lives. It's an excellent performance by a young Christian Slater, and the rest of the cast. The whole story, every scene, each dialog, they all ring of authenticity. And the soundtrack is amazing. It might be getting old, but it doesn't feel like it.

    In a career dotted with offbeat and quirky roles Christian Slater was at his most offbeat and quirky in Pump Up The Volume. Slater plays a young transfer student from an eastern high school to a new school in Arizona. His Clark Kent persona is a mild mannered wallflower type. But his father made the mistake of giving him a short wave radio set to keep in touch with friends back east who are presumably ham radio operators. What Slater does is create his own pirate radio station and starts with another whole personality of disc jockey Harry Hardon. Slater's other self isn't Superman, he's more like a teenage version of Howard Beale from Network. He's amusing at first until one of the students commits suicide after calling in and Slater does little to discourage his intentions. That's a hard call to make, even professionals miss telltale signs of that kind of serious depression. But when Slater starts disrupting the power structure in the person of principal Annie Ross, the hunt is on with even the Federal Communications Commission brought in to track down this broadcasting felon. Imagine Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest as a school principal and you've got Ross. The main weakness of Pump Up The Volume is that Slater and Ross create the only two memorable characters. All the rest are strictly in support, we get no insights into any of the rest of the cast. But these two are memorable characters. A teenage mad prophet of the air and a school principal from hell. Pump Up The Volume is a staple for Christian Slater fans.

    Ugly American teenagers in an ugly American suburb force an ugly plastic rebellion against the ugly "authority". The music aside, this is a poor film. The story is stupid, the direction is laboured, the characters have zero depth and I ended it yawning and wondering if it was over yet. It has the none of the darkly comic moments of its supposed peers and is directed in a sub Back To The Future style without any of the genius or even coherence those films have. People claiming this as some sort of lost classic in the same vein as Heathers are just trying to make themselves look cool.

    To me, it's the perfect companion piece to Heathers. It has the same message, but this time Slater's character is the voice of reason who the audience can side with, instead of an agent of destruction... Many of the same themes are touched upon in the two films; how hard it is to be an adolescent when you feel like you're being disenfranchised, and the sense of feeling shepherded into the uniform lines of conformity that produce the obedient workers of the future. However, in contrast to the dark tone of "Heathers", "Pump up the Volume" strikes an optimistic note of people banding together to build something, rather than the savage nihilism that says to induce change, you have to completely obliterate things and start again. Ultimately, doing your best to get the message heard makes a heck of a lot more sense than simply putting a bomb under the problem, and then absolving yourself of the results.

    Some "kids" my age were defined by certain movies, namely John Hughes classics, though you probably can't get a lot of guys to admit that. The sadly underperforming Pump Up the Volume was mine. It was back in 1989 when I started taking movies more seriously, seeing them more and noticing that they'll eventually consume me. A year later, I saw my first Christian Slater movie (though, almost immediately following, I watched  and not for him  Young Guns II) as well as a "star" I would fall in love with for thereafter: Samantha Mathis, coincidentally, her first movie. I remember loving the movie, the idea, the setting  finally a teen movie that was set in my current location, Arizona, the mood, the dialogue, the music and definitely the message. What also impressed me was the nonchalant take they had on homosexuality and how the main hero, Hard Harry (Slater) was so accepting of it. (Side Note: I hadn't come out yet by this point, but this certainly helped verses all the negativity surrounding the "gay lifestyle" I heard around me.) And as independent as this was, it was certainly far before it's time. Christian Slater really plays Mark, but, in what also appealed to me, by night his "Clark Kent" image of Mark was transformed into the "Superman" Hard Harry on a radio program on an unused frequency. What he was doing would be considered a podcast nowadays, only he went the long, and probably only, way around it. Literally, he didn't think anyone was listening. So this lonely kid, Mark, who was moved by his parents to a small Arizona town, babbles on the air about how bad the high school he was attending as well as the small town. Although, it sounds like he's complaining, he's actually hitting on some direct topics the parents and school board are either ignoring or were ignorant of. Well, the kids are listening, one by one, growing by the night. Namely, Nora (Mathis), the obvious "Lois Lane" of the trio of characters (if you count Clark and Supe as two), who's trying to find the identity of the voice she hears and absolutely agrees with. Oh, and is it obvious she's also in love with Hard Harry? A tragedy, one you might not expect with the direction the movie was headed, occurs and now Hard Harry's a target for parents, police, the FCC and of course the school board for what he's saying might actually be true. They all want him shut down. Naturally, all the kids want him to continue  he's their voice, each and every one of them. Only, Clark, er, Mark's conflicted and the much more shy version of Hard Harry. Leave it to Lois, er, Nora, to save the day once again by giving the real hero a backbone. I rated this with the highest rating I give: 10/10 stars. I do this for nostalgia purposes, obviously, but re-watching this movie now, after not seeing it for probably 15+ years, it really holds up today. Sure, the one message (revealed in the end) of why the school board is wronging the students is somewhat weak, the dozens of others thoroughly outweigh that revolution. Also, as mentioned, I did love (literally, I fell hard for) Mathis; she did a fantastic first job and bold  see: well, her. Further, Slater equally did a excellent job. And the soundtrack remains as one of my all time favorites. I have probably listened to Everybody Knows by Concrete Blonde 660 times since this came out. This was the un-Hollywood independent film I will cherish for all time. It wasn't splashy, it was intentionally small, it was tight and it was right. All that I wrote above about my first impressions back in 1990 hold up and I stand by them. Watch this movie and know what it was TRULY like being a teen in the early nineties.

And so, like Howard Beale, Hunter yells from a radio, before being shut down. 8.9/10  One of the best teen movies of the 1990s, despite a weak, corny third act.

    Pump Up the Volume might have been the true opening salvo of the 90s, and the voice of Generation X, but it speaks to every teen of every generation. It is about raising your voice, being heard, but only with the advent of the Internet was its dream fully realized. This is the type of movie that will make you want to write your own blog, make a video journal, or do a podcast. It has that quality that grip people attention and make them do things worthwhile with their lives. It's an excellent performance by a young Christian Slater, and the rest of the cast. The whole story, every scene, each dialog, they all ring of authenticity. And the soundtrack is amazing. It might be getting old, but it doesn't feel like it.

    In a career dotted with offbeat and quirky roles Christian Slater was at his most offbeat and quirky in Pump Up The Volume. Slater plays a young transfer student from an eastern high school to a new school in Arizona. His Clark Kent persona is a mild mannered wallflower type. But his father made the mistake of giving him a short wave radio set to keep in touch with friends back east who are presumably ham radio operators. What Slater does is create his own pirate radio station and starts with another whole personality of disc jockey Harry Hardon. Slater's other self isn't Superman, he's more like a teenage version of Howard Beale from Network. He's amusing at first until one of the students commits suicide after calling in and Slater does little to discourage his intentions. That's a hard call to make, even professionals miss telltale signs of that kind of serious depression. But when Slater starts disrupting the power structure in the person of principal Annie Ross, the hunt is on with even the Federal Communications Commission brought in to track down this broadcasting felon. Imagine Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest as a school principal and you've got Ross. The main weakness of Pump Up The Volume is that Slater and Ross create the only two memorable characters. All the rest are strictly in support, we get no insights into any of the rest of the cast. But these two are memorable characters. A teenage mad prophet of the air and a school principal from hell. Pump Up The Volume is a staple for Christian Slater fans.

    Ugly American teenagers in an ugly American suburb force an ugly plastic rebellion against the ugly "authority". The music aside, this is a poor film. The story is stupid, the direction is laboured, the characters have zero depth and I ended it yawning and wondering if it was over yet. It has the none of the darkly comic moments of its supposed peers and is directed in a sub Back To The Future style without any of the genius or even coherence those films have. People claiming this as some sort of lost classic in the same vein as Heathers are just trying to make themselves look cool.

    To me, it's the perfect companion piece to Heathers. It has the same message, but this time Slater's character is the voice of reason who the audience can side with, instead of an agent of destruction... Many of the same themes are touched upon in the two films; how hard it is to be an adolescent when you feel like you're being disenfranchised, and the sense of feeling shepherded into the uniform lines of conformity that produce the obedient workers of the future. However, in contrast to the dark tone of "Heathers", "Pump up the Volume" strikes an optimistic note of people banding together to build something, rather than the savage nihilism that says to induce change, you have to completely obliterate things and start again. Ultimately, doing your best to get the message heard makes a heck of a lot more sense than simply putting a bomb under the problem, and then absolving yourself of the results.

    Some "kids" my age were defined by certain movies, namely John Hughes classics, though you probably can't get a lot of guys to admit that. The sadly underperforming Pump Up the Volume was mine. It was back in 1989 when I started taking movies more seriously, seeing them more and noticing that they'll eventually consume me. A year later, I saw my first Christian Slater movie (though, almost immediately following, I watched  and not for him  Young Guns II) as well as a "star" I would fall in love with for thereafter: Samantha Mathis, coincidentally, her first movie. I remember loving the movie, the idea, the setting  finally a teen movie that was set in my current location, Arizona, the mood, the dialogue, the music and definitely the message. What also impressed me was the nonchalant take they had on homosexuality and how the main hero, Hard Harry (Slater) was so accepting of it. (Side Note: I hadn't come out yet by this point, but this certainly helped verses all the negativity surrounding the "gay lifestyle" I heard around me.) And as independent as this was, it was certainly far before it's time. Christian Slater really plays Mark, but, in what also appealed to me, by night his "Clark Kent" image of Mark was transformed into the "Superman" Hard Harry on a radio program on an unused frequency. What he was doing would be considered a podcast nowadays, only he went the long, and probably only, way around it. Literally, he didn't think anyone was listening. So this lonely kid, Mark, who was moved by his parents to a small Arizona town, babbles on the air about how bad the high school he was attending as well as the small town. Although, it sounds like he's complaining, he's actually hitting on some direct topics the parents and school board are either ignoring or were ignorant of. Well, the kids are listening, one by one, growing by the night. Namely, Nora (Mathis), the obvious "Lois Lane" of the trio of characters (if you count Clark and Supe as two), who's trying to find the identity of the voice she hears and absolutely agrees with. Oh, and is it obvious she's also in love with Hard Harry? A tragedy, one you might not expect with the direction the movie was headed, occurs and now Hard Harry's a target for parents, police, the FCC and of course the school board for what he's saying might actually be true. They all want him shut down. Naturally, all the kids want him to continue  he's their voice, each and every one of them. Only, Clark, er, Mark's conflicted and the much more shy version of Hard Harry. Leave it to Lois, er, Nora, to save the day once again by giving the real hero a backbone. I rated this with the highest rating I give: 10/10 stars. I do this for nostalgia purposes, obviously, but re-watching this movie now, after not seeing it for probably 15+ years, it really holds up today. Sure, the one message (revealed in the end) of why the school board is wronging the students is somewhat weak, the dozens of others thoroughly outweigh that revolution. Also, as mentioned, I did love (literally, I fell hard for) Mathis; she did a fantastic first job and bold  see: well, her. Further, Slater equally did a excellent job. And the soundtrack remains as one of my all time favorites. I have probably listened to Everybody Knows by Concrete Blonde 660 times since this came out. This was the un-Hollywood independent film I will cherish for all time. It wasn't splashy, it was intentionally small, it was tight and it was right. All that I wrote above about my first impressions back in 1990 hold up and I stand by them. Watch this movie and know what it was TRULY like being a teen in the early nineties.

    I like the movie, "Pump Up the Volume", it's a good movie in the decade right now in 2011, this is my favorite film still, Christian Slater's brilliant performance in this 1990 comedy/drama, Slater played as Mark Hunter, a shy high school student who's a independent and quiet young student, but at night he became pirate radio VJ, Hard Harry, and Hard Harry had a voice sound like Jack Nicholson, Samantha Mathis in her film debut as Nora, Nora is sweet, but she is wild, the soundtrack in the movie is great, I like the songs in the film including Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows, Ice-T, Beastie Boys, and Was Not Was' Dad, I'm in Jail, and the songs also was featured in the soundtrack album also including artists like Soundgraden, Liquid Jesus, Sonic Youth, Above The Law, Peter Murphy, and more, Plot is great, I like this movie a lot.

    Pump Up The Volume stars Christian Slater as Mark, a shy high schooler who has an alter ego. In the evenings, he broadcasts from some equipment set up in his parents basement, creating a radio persona named "Hard Harry." He is wild and profane, but talks honestly about that things that bother him as a young adult. Eventally, his classmates begin to discover his broadcast, and the word spreads among them until he is a local phenomenon. Except that no one knows who it is saying all these things, because Mark is quiet and timid in class. He starts talking about some of the questionable practices going on at his school, which gets the attention of the administration and eventually the authorities. The pressure builds as more kids rely on "Harry" for direction, and more adults are trying to find him and shut him down. It eventually ends with the principal of the school being exposed and fired, just as Harry is discovered and apprehended. We are left to make our own assumptions as to how the student body will respond and move forward now that Harry is off the air. I was pretty apathetic about this story. I didn't find it all that memorable. I think the stuff I enjoyed most was the inspirational parts of Harry's broadcast (mixed in with scatological humor). I thought a lot of it was well written, although not really believable dialog for a high school student. If I had seen this movie when it came out, it might hold some nostalgic value. Watching it for the first time this year, it didn't do much for me.

    So many movies echo of the days of youth such as Stand By Me, The Outsiders, and The Breakfast Club, but do they really speak to us? Is there one with such a strong, powerful voice that will pull us to our feet, open our eyes, and touch our soul? Is there one, who could talk on and talk hard, holding the world in the sway of his words and in the depth of his heart? What is it in a voice that captivates us? Is it the actor breathing life into fiction or the storyline filled with drama? Either way, we are listening, and the power of speech plays on in the movie, Pump Up The Volume. And Pink Floyd said it best, "For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to talk."

    Christian Slater plays Mark Hunter, a shy teenager who has just moved from the East coast to Arizona. His parents give him a short wave radio set that he turns into a pirate radio station where his shyness evaporates, and instead he uses the handle "Hard Harry", where he vents his frustrations and confusions to his fellow teenagers, who it turns out are very receptive to this message, and "Hard Harry" finds himself the most popular and influential person in town, much to his high school principal's consternation. Things take a dark turn when a troubled teenage listener commits suicide, and the authorities become eager to shut down his illegal broadcasts. Smart and appealing film has a fine performance from Christian Slater, that really speaks to the hearts and minds of teenagers, and still rings true. Dramatically uneven, but will resonate strongly with people who like to listen to talk radio.

    "Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religions destroy spirituality." - Michael Ellner Alan Moyle's "Pump Up The Volume" stars Christian Slater as Mark Hunter, a high school student who lives in a sleepy, Arizonan town. Looking to lash out at the world, Mark starts an FM pirate radio station. This station becomes an outlet for his angst and aggression. The film then becomes a teen version of "Network" or "Rebel Without a Cause", Mark rallying fellow disaffected and alienated youths until he becomes the unwitting leader of a minor student revolution. In historical terms, Hunter's caught in the deadlock of late capitalism, or what Francis Fukuyama called "the end of history", a time populated by what Nietzsche called "the last men"; pathetic, contemptible things. Fukuyama's position counterpointed that of Hegel and Marx, who saw historical development as a purposeful journey from primitive stages of consciousness to "something better". This goes against the "there is no alternative" (T.I.N.A) mantra of late capitalism, a stance explicitly reborn in the mid 20th century, but which has bee around in various forms much longer, perhaps starting with Thomas Malthus, a nineteenth century progenitor of "no alternative" politics and its credo of "permanent" scarcity and "necessary poverty". Malthus contested nineteenth century radicals who were steadfast in their belief that labour, properly deployed, could usher in a new society. Indeed, the initial need for elites to publicly announce the absence of any alternative to existing social arrangements was entirely a defensive move, in response to such radical ideas. One of the first to counter T.I.N.A was William Godwin. In his 1793 book, "Enquiry Concerning Political Justice", he argued that the "existing state creates a servile and truckling spirit," and that the cruel monotony of the system "produces a kind of stupid and hopeless vacancy in every face". From Godwin can be drawn a line to libertarians, anarchist communism, socialism and even the labour theory of value. The British government then tried to prosecute Godwin for treason, but abandoned the idea. Godwin was instead attacked by Malthus, who in "Principles of Political Economy" essentially defended class structures and even went so far as to advocate starving the poor because "that way they wouldn't breed too heavily". In anticipation of the permanent war economy of the United States, Malthus would even offer war and state debt as perfect mechanisms for "enhancing value through the careful calibration of scarcity". So though white and privileged, Hunter's part of a long list of validly ticked off people. On air he calls himself "Hard Harry", and begins his radio program with Leonard Cohen's "Everybody Knows", the lyrics "everybody knows the dice are loaded, everybody rolls with their fingers crossed" heralding his audio rants. "All the great themes have been used up and turned into theme parks," he tells his audience, as he begins to develop a sort of naive political manifesto. Where adults condescend, he empathises, where they ignore, he provides an outlet for the hopes, dreams, fears and tragedies of other youths. Elsewhere Hunter challenges the ethos of his college, which cares more about test scores and image than actual education. Unsurprisingly, his college is named after Hubert Humphrey, a despicable archetype of cold war neoliberalism and apologist for much violence (Vietnam, the police beatings of peace activists etc). "The truth is a virus," Hunter tells his listeners, as he becomes increasingly subversive and empowering, shaking fellow students out of apathy. "It begins with us! Not the experts, but the ones who need it most!" Pretty soon he's changed from an object of hero worship to one of strategic appropriation, youths taking from him what they need to advance their own empowerment and emancipation. Elsewhere the songs he plays are politically charged, but in offbeat ways. There's "Freedom of Speech" by Above the Law, Ice T states "I've no time to whisper in your ear", Hunter plays "Wave of Mutilation" by the Pixies, has Soundgarden say "Accused and convicted for nothing" and Liquid Jesus "Stand, and they will make you crawl". "Nothing is more important than a good education!" adults tell Hunter. "Except the basic right to it," he counters. Slowly he moves from isolation and individualism to community and collective action. He accepts that he has a responsibility to his listeners, understands that meaning and expression are terrains of political contestation, repeatedly fought over, but then quickly finds himself chased by the police and FBI. They want to shut him down. To silence him. The film ends with Harry on the run, romantic engagement finally deemed inadequate, until a final sequence in which every student in America starts their own pirate radio station. This is offered as something positive, but the internet/Facebook generation's told us otherwise: the podiums afforded by technology increase atomization and tend to become just more outlets for narcissism. Traditionally, young people have energised democratic movements. But resistance to domination has been subdued and power has long created societal institutions designed to break resistance. The young, reflexively impotent, are perhaps now entirely acquiesced to the idea that they can and will be repeatedly screwed. Large debts, and the fear they create, have become a pacifying force. Elsewhere we psychopathologize and medicate noncompliance, a fact which led Erich Fromm to state that "today the function of psychiatry and medicine threatens to become the tool in the manipulation of man." Indeed, schools themselves inculcate compliance not democracy, and routinely traffic standardisation and fear. The intelligent are shamed, surveillance is normalised and fundamentalist Religion and Fundamentalist Consumerism are exalted above all things. And so, like Howard Beale, Hunter yells from a radio, before being shut down. 8.9/10  One of the best teen movies of the 1990s, despite a weak, corny third act.

It has the same message, but this time Slater's character is the voice of reason who the audience can side with, instead of an agent of destruction... Many of the same themes are touched upon in the two films; how hard it is to be an adolescent when you feel like you're being disenfranchised, and the sense of feeling shepherded into the uniform lines of conformity that produce the obedient workers of the future. However, in contrast to the dark tone of "Heathers", "Pump up the Volume" strikes an optimistic note of people banding together to build something, rather than the savage nihilism that says to induce change, you have to completely obliterate things and start again. Ultimately, doing your best to get the message heard makes a heck of a lot more sense than simply putting a bomb under the problem, and then absolving yourself of the results.

Watching it for the first time this year, it didn't do much for me.

    So many movies echo of the days of youth such as Stand By Me, The Outsiders, and The Breakfast Club, but do they really speak to us? Is there one with such a strong, powerful voice that will pull us to our feet, open our eyes, and touch our soul? Is there one, who could talk on and talk hard, holding the world in the sway of his words and in the depth of his heart? What is it in a voice that captivates us? Is it the actor breathing life into fiction or the storyline filled with drama? Either way, we are listening, and the power of speech plays on in the movie, Pump Up The Volume. And Pink Floyd said it best, "For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to talk."

    Christian Slater plays Mark Hunter, a shy teenager who has just moved from the East coast to Arizona. His parents give him a short wave radio set that he turns into a pirate radio station where his shyness evaporates, and instead he uses the handle "Hard Harry", where he vents his frustrations and confusions to his fellow teenagers, who it turns out are very receptive to this message, and "Hard Harry" finds himself the most popular and influential person in town, much to his high school principal's consternation. Things take a dark turn when a troubled teenage listener commits suicide, and the authorities become eager to shut down his illegal broadcasts. Smart and appealing film has a fine performance from Christian Slater, that really speaks to the hearts and minds of teenagers, and still rings true. Dramatically uneven, but will resonate strongly with people who like to listen to talk radio.

    "Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religions destroy spirituality." - Michael Ellner Alan Moyle's "Pump Up The Volume" stars Christian Slater as Mark Hunter, a high school student who lives in a sleepy, Arizonan town. Looking to lash out at the world, Mark starts an FM pirate radio station. This station becomes an outlet for his angst and aggression. The film then becomes a teen version of "Network" or "Rebel Without a Cause", Mark rallying fellow disaffected and alienated youths until he becomes the unwitting leader of a minor student revolution. In historical terms, Hunter's caught in the deadlock of late capitalism, or what Francis Fukuyama called "the end of history", a time populated by what Nietzsche called "the last men"; pathetic, contemptible things. Fukuyama's position counterpointed that of Hegel and Marx, who saw historical development as a purposeful journey from primitive stages of consciousness to "something better". This goes against the "there is no alternative" (T.I.N.A) mantra of late capitalism, a stance explicitly reborn in the mid 20th century, but which has bee around in various forms much longer, perhaps starting with Thomas Malthus, a nineteenth century progenitor of "no alternative" politics and its credo of "permanent" scarcity and "necessary poverty". Malthus contested nineteenth century radicals who were steadfast in their belief that labour, properly deployed, could usher in a new society. Indeed, the initial need for elites to publicly announce the absence of any alternative to existing social arrangements was entirely a defensive move, in response to such radical ideas. One of the first to counter T.I.N.A was William Godwin. In his 1793 book, "Enquiry Concerning Political Justice", he argued that the "existing state creates a servile and truckling spirit," and that the cruel monotony of the system "produces a kind of stupid and hopeless vacancy in every face". From Godwin can be drawn a line to libertarians, anarchist communism, socialism and even the labour theory of value. The British government then tried to prosecute Godwin for treason, but abandoned the idea. Godwin was instead attacked by Malthus, who in "Principles of Political Economy" essentially defended class structures and even went so far as to advocate starving the poor because "that way they wouldn't breed too heavily". In anticipation of the permanent war economy of the United States, Malthus would even offer war and state debt as perfect mechanisms for "enhancing value through the careful calibration of scarcity". So though white and privileged, Hunter's part of a long list of validly ticked off people. On air he calls himself "Hard Harry", and begins his radio program with Leonard Cohen's "Everybody Knows", the lyrics "everybody knows the dice are loaded, everybody rolls with their fingers crossed" heralding his audio rants. "All the great themes have been used up and turned into theme parks," he tells his audience, as he begins to develop a sort of naive political manifesto. Where adults condescend, he empathises, where they ignore, he provides an outlet for the hopes, dreams, fears and tragedies of other youths. Elsewhere Hunter challenges the ethos of his college, which cares more about test scores and image than actual education. Unsurprisingly, his college is named after Hubert Humphrey, a despicable archetype of cold war neoliberalism and apologist for much violence (Vietnam, the police beatings of peace activists etc). "The truth is a virus," Hunter tells his listeners, as he becomes increasingly subversive and empowering, shaking fellow students out of apathy. "It begins with us! Not the experts, but the ones who need it most!" Pretty soon he's changed from an object of hero worship to one of strategic appropriation, youths taking from him what they need to advance their own empowerment and emancipation. Elsewhere the songs he plays are politically charged, but in offbeat ways. There's "Freedom of Speech" by Above the Law, Ice T states "I've no time to whisper in your ear", Hunter plays "Wave of Mutilation" by the Pixies, has Soundgarden say "Accused and convicted for nothing" and Liquid Jesus "Stand, and they will make you crawl". "Nothing is more important than a good education!" adults tell Hunter. "Except the basic right to it," he counters. Slowly he moves from isolation and individualism to community and collective action. He accepts that he has a responsibility to his listeners, understands that meaning and expression are terrains of political contestation, repeatedly fought over, but then quickly finds himself chased by the police and FBI. They want to shut him down. To silence him. The film ends with Harry on the run, romantic engagement finally deemed inadequate, until a final sequence in which every student in America starts their own pirate radio station. This is offered as something positive, but the internet/Facebook generation's told us otherwise: the podiums afforded by technology increase atomization and tend to become just more outlets for narcissism. Traditionally, young people have energised democratic movements. But resistance to domination has been subdued and power has long created societal institutions designed to break resistance. The young, reflexively impotent, are perhaps now entirely acquiesced to the idea that they can and will be repeatedly screwed. Large debts, and the fear they create, have become a pacifying force. Elsewhere we psychopathologize and medicate noncompliance, a fact which led Erich Fromm to state that "today the function of psychiatry and medicine threatens to become the tool in the manipulation of man." Indeed, schools themselves inculcate compliance not democracy, and routinely traffic standardisation and fear. The intelligent are shamed, surveillance is normalised and fundamentalist Religion and Fundamentalist Consumerism are exalted above all things. And so, like Howard Beale, Hunter yells from a radio, before being shut down. 8.9/10  One of the best teen movies of the 1990s, despite a weak, corny third act.

    Pump Up the Volume might have been the true opening salvo of the 90s, and the voice of Generation X, but it speaks to every teen of every generation. It is about raising your voice, being heard, but only with the advent of the Internet was its dream fully realized. This is the type of movie that will make you want to write your own blog, make a video journal, or do a podcast. It has that quality that grip people attention and make them do things worthwhile with their lives. It's an excellent performance by a young Christian Slater, and the rest of the cast. The whole story, every scene, each dialog, they all ring of authenticity. And the soundtrack is amazing. It might be getting old, but it doesn't feel like it.

    In a career dotted with offbeat and quirky roles Christian Slater was at his most offbeat and quirky in Pump Up The Volume. Slater plays a young transfer student from an eastern high school to a new school in Arizona. His Clark Kent persona is a mild mannered wallflower type. But his father made the mistake of giving him a short wave radio set to keep in touch with friends back east who are presumably ham radio operators. What Slater does is create his own pirate radio station and starts with another whole personality of disc jockey Harry Hardon. Slater's other self isn't Superman, he's more like a teenage version of Howard Beale from Network. He's amusing at first until one of the students commits suicide after calling in and Slater does little to discourage his intentions. That's a hard call to make, even professionals miss telltale signs of that kind of serious depression. But when Slater starts disrupting the power structure in the person of principal Annie Ross, the hunt is on with even the Federal Communications Commission brought in to track down this broadcasting felon. Imagine Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest as a school principal and you've got Ross. The main weakness of Pump Up The Volume is that Slater and Ross create the only two memorable characters. All the rest are strictly in support, we get no insights into any of the rest of the cast. But these two are memorable characters. A teenage mad prophet of the air and a school principal from hell. Pump Up The Volume is a staple for Christian Slater fans.

    Ugly American teenagers in an ugly American suburb force an ugly plastic rebellion against the ugly "authority". The music aside, this is a poor film. The story is stupid, the direction is laboured, the characters have zero depth and I ended it yawning and wondering if it was over yet. It has the none of the darkly comic moments of its supposed peers and is directed in a sub Back To The Future style without any of the genius or even coherence those films have. People claiming this as some sort of lost classic in the same vein as Heathers are just trying to make themselves look cool.

    To me, it's the perfect companion piece to Heathers. It has the same message, but this time Slater's character is the voice of reason who the audience can side with, instead of an agent of destruction... Many of the same themes are touched upon in the two films; how hard it is to be an adolescent when you feel like you're being disenfranchised, and the sense of feeling shepherded into the uniform lines of conformity that produce the obedient workers of the future. However, in contrast to the dark tone of "Heathers", "Pump up the Volume" strikes an optimistic note of people banding together to build something, rather than the savage nihilism that says to induce change, you have to completely obliterate things and start again. Ultimately, doing your best to get the message heard makes a heck of a lot more sense than simply putting a bomb under the problem, and then absolving yourself of the results.

    Some "kids" my age were defined by certain movies, namely John Hughes classics, though you probably can't get a lot of guys to admit that. The sadly underperforming Pump Up the Volume was mine. It was back in 1989 when I started taking movies more seriously, seeing them more and noticing that they'll eventually consume me. A year later, I saw my first Christian Slater movie (though, almost immediately following, I watched  and not for him  Young Guns II) as well as a "star" I would fall in love with for thereafter: Samantha Mathis, coincidentally, her first movie. I remember loving the movie, the idea, the setting  finally a teen movie that was set in my current location, Arizona, the mood, the dialogue, the music and definitely the message. What also impressed me was the nonchalant take they had on homosexuality and how the main hero, Hard Harry (Slater) was so accepting of it. (Side Note: I hadn't come out yet by this point, but this certainly helped verses all the negativity surrounding the "gay lifestyle" I heard around me.) And as independent as this was, it was certainly far before it's time. Christian Slater really plays Mark, but, in what also appealed to me, by night his "Clark Kent" image of Mark was transformed into the "Superman" Hard Harry on a radio program on an unused frequency. What he was doing would be considered a podcast nowadays, only he went the long, and probably only, way around it. Literally, he didn't think anyone was listening. So this lonely kid, Mark, who was moved by his parents to a small Arizona town, babbles on the air about how bad the high school he was attending as well as the small town. Although, it sounds like he's complaining, he's actually hitting on some direct topics the parents and school board are either ignoring or were ignorant of. Well, the kids are listening, one by one, growing by the night. Namely, Nora (Mathis), the obvious "Lois Lane" of the trio of characters (if you count Clark and Supe as two), who's trying to find the identity of the voice she hears and absolutely agrees with. Oh, and is it obvious she's also in love with Hard Harry? A tragedy, one you might not expect with the direction the movie was headed, occurs and now Hard Harry's a target for parents, police, the FCC and of course the school board for what he's saying might actually be true. They all want him shut down. Naturally, all the kids want him to continue  he's their voice, each and every one of them. Only, Clark, er, Mark's conflicted and the much more shy version of Hard Harry. Leave it to Lois, er, Nora, to save the day once again by giving the real hero a backbone. I rated this with the highest rating I give: 10/10 stars. I do this for nostalgia purposes, obviously, but re-watching this movie now, after not seeing it for probably 15+ years, it really holds up today. Sure, the one message (revealed in the end) of why the school board is wronging the students is somewhat weak, the dozens of others thoroughly outweigh that revolution. Also, as mentioned, I did love (literally, I fell hard for) Mathis; she did a fantastic first job and bold  see: well, her. Further, Slater equally did a excellent job. And the soundtrack remains as one of my all time favorites. I have probably listened to Everybody Knows by Concrete Blonde 660 times since this came out. This was the un-Hollywood independent film I will cherish for all time. It wasn't splashy, it was intentionally small, it was tight and it was right. All that I wrote above about my first impressions back in 1990 hold up and I stand by them. Watch this movie and know what it was TRULY like being a teen in the early nineties.

    I like the movie, "Pump Up the Volume", it's a good movie in the decade right now in 2011, this is my favorite film still, Christian Slater's brilliant performance in this 1990 comedy/drama, Slater played as Mark Hunter, a shy high school student who's a independent and quiet young student, but at night he became pirate radio VJ, Hard Harry, and Hard Harry had a voice sound like Jack Nicholson, Samantha Mathis in her film debut as Nora, Nora is sweet, but she is wild, the soundtrack in the movie is great, I like the songs in the film including Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows, Ice-T, Beastie Boys, and Was Not Was' Dad, I'm in Jail, and the songs also was featured in the soundtrack album also including artists like Soundgraden, Liquid Jesus, Sonic Youth, Above The Law, Peter Murphy, and more, Plot is great, I like this movie a lot.

    Pump Up The Volume stars Christian Slater as Mark, a shy high schooler who has an alter ego. In the evenings, he broadcasts from some equipment set up in his parents basement, creating a radio persona named "Hard Harry." He is wild and profane, but talks honestly about that things that bother him as a young adult. Eventally, his classmates begin to discover his broadcast, and the word spreads among them until he is a local phenomenon. Except that no one knows who it is saying all these things, because Mark is quiet and timid in class. He starts talking about some of the questionable practices going on at his school, which gets the attention of the administration and eventually the authorities. The pressure builds as more kids rely on "Harry" for direction, and more adults are trying to find him and shut him down. It eventually ends with the principal of the school being exposed and fired, just as Harry is discovered and apprehended. We are left to make our own assumptions as to how the student body will respond and move forward now that Harry is off the air. I was pretty apathetic about this story. I didn't find it all that memorable. I think the stuff I enjoyed most was the inspirational parts of Harry's broadcast (mixed in with scatological humor). I thought a lot of it was well written, although not really believable dialog for a high school student. If I had seen this movie when it came out, it might hold some nostalgic value. Watching it for the first time this year, it didn't do much for me.

    To me, it's the perfect companion piece to Heathers. It has the same message, but this time Slater's character is the voice of reason who the audience can side with, instead of an agent of destruction... Many of the same themes are touched upon in the two films; how hard it is to be an adolescent when you feel like you're being disenfranchised, and the sense of feeling shepherded into the uniform lines of conformity that produce the obedient workers of the future. However, in contrast to the dark tone of "Heathers", "Pump up the Volume" strikes an optimistic note of people banding together to build something, rather than the savage nihilism that says to induce change, you have to completely obliterate things and start again. Ultimately, doing your best to get the message heard makes a heck of a lot more sense than simply putting a bomb under the problem, and then absolving yourself of the results.

    Some "kids" my age were defined by certain movies, namely John Hughes classics, though you probably can't get a lot of guys to admit that. The sadly underperforming Pump Up the Volume was mine. It was back in 1989 when I started taking movies more seriously, seeing them more and noticing that they'll eventually consume me. A year later, I saw my first Christian Slater movie (though, almost immediately following, I watched  and not for him  Young Guns II) as well as a "star" I would fall in love with for thereafter: Samantha Mathis, coincidentally, her first movie. I remember loving the movie, the idea, the setting  finally a teen movie that was set in my current location, Arizona, the mood, the dialogue, the music and definitely the message. What also impressed me was the nonchalant take they had on homosexuality and how the main hero, Hard Harry (Slater) was so accepting of it. (Side Note: I hadn't come out yet by this point, but this certainly helped verses all the negativity surrounding the "gay lifestyle" I heard around me.) And as independent as this was, it was certainly far before it's time. Christian Slater really plays Mark, but, in what also appealed to me, by night his "Clark Kent" image of Mark was transformed into the "Superman" Hard Harry on a radio program on an unused frequency. What he was doing would be considered a podcast nowadays, only he went the long, and probably only, way around it. Literally, he didn't think anyone was listening. So this lonely kid, Mark, who was moved by his parents to a small Arizona town, babbles on the air about how bad the high school he was attending as well as the small town. Although, it sounds like he's complaining, he's actually hitting on some direct topics the parents and school board are either ignoring or were ignorant of. Well, the kids are listening, one by one, growing by the night. Namely, Nora (Mathis), the obvious "Lois Lane" of the trio of characters (if you count Clark and Supe as two), who's trying to find the identity of the voice she hears and absolutely agrees with. Oh, and is it obvious she's also in love with Hard Harry? A tragedy, one you might not expect with the direction the movie was headed, occurs and now Hard Harry's a target for parents, police, the FCC and of course the school board for what he's saying might actually be true. They all want him shut down. Naturally, all the kids want him to continue  he's their voice, each and every one of them. Only, Clark, er, Mark's conflicted and the much more shy version of Hard Harry. Leave it to Lois, er, Nora, to save the day once again by giving the real hero a backbone. I rated this with the highest rating I give: 10/10 stars. I do this for nostalgia purposes, obviously, but re-watching this movie now, after not seeing it for probably 15+ years, it really holds up today. Sure, the one message (revealed in the end) of why the school board is wronging the students is somewhat weak, the dozens of others thoroughly outweigh that revolution. Also, as mentioned, I did love (literally, I fell hard for) Mathis; she did a fantastic first job and bold  see: well, her. Further, Slater equally did a excellent job. And the soundtrack remains as one of my all time favorites. I have probably listened to Everybody Knows by Concrete Blonde 660 times since this came out. This was the un-Hollywood independent film I will cherish for all time. It wasn't splashy, it was intentionally small, it was tight and it was right. All that I wrote above about my first impressions back in 1990 hold up and I stand by them. Watch this movie and know what it was TRULY like being a teen in the early nineties.

    I like the movie, "Pump Up the Volume", it's a good movie in the decade right now in 2011, this is my favorite film still, Christian Slater's brilliant performance in this 1990 comedy/drama, Slater played as Mark Hunter, a shy high school student who's a independent and quiet young student, but at night he became pirate radio VJ, Hard Harry, and Hard Harry had a voice sound like Jack Nicholson, Samantha Mathis in her film debut as Nora, Nora is sweet, but she is wild, the soundtrack in the movie is great, I like the songs in the film including Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows, Ice-T, Beastie Boys, and Was Not Was' Dad, I'm in Jail, and the songs also was featured in the soundtrack album also including artists like Soundgraden, Liquid Jesus, Sonic Youth, Above The Law, Peter Murphy, and more, Plot is great, I like this movie a lot.

    Pump Up The Volume stars Christian Slater as Mark, a shy high schooler who has an alter ego. In the evenings, he broadcasts from some equipment set up in his parents basement, creating a radio persona named "Hard Harry." He is wild and profane, but talks honestly about that things that bother him as a young adult. Eventally, his classmates begin to discover his broadcast, and the word spreads among them until he is a local phenomenon. Except that no one knows who it is saying all these things, because Mark is quiet and timid in class. He starts talking about some of the questionable practices going on at his school, which gets the attention of the administration and eventually the authorities. The pressure builds as more kids rely on "Harry" for direction, and more adults are trying to find him and shut him down. It eventually ends with the principal of the school being exposed and fired, just as Harry is discovered and apprehended. We are left to make our own assumptions as to how the student body will respond and move forward now that Harry is off the air. I was pretty apathetic about this story. I didn't find it all that memorable. I think the stuff I enjoyed most was the inspirational parts of Harry's broadcast (mixed in with scatological humor). I thought a lot of it was well written, although not really believable dialog for a high school student. If I had seen this movie when it came out, it might hold some nostalgic value. Watching it for the first time this year, it didn't do much for me.

    So many movies echo of the days of youth such as Stand By Me, The Outsiders, and The Breakfast Club, but do they really speak to us? Is there one with such a strong, powerful voice that will pull us to our feet, open our eyes, and touch our soul? Is there one, who could talk on and talk hard, holding the world in the sway of his words and in the depth of his heart? What is it in a voice that captivates us? Is it the actor breathing life into fiction or the storyline filled with drama? Either way, we are listening, and the power of speech plays on in the movie, Pump Up The Volume. And Pink Floyd said it best, "For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to talk."
