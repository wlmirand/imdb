    this is my first "review" on IMDb and i would like to underline that it's a result of unjustified negativity towards this movie. the movie "kids" is kind of a testament to a certain generation. just like the movie "taxi driver" is to another generation, or merely a different span in time. i cannot comprehend why anyone would rate this movie negative in any way shape or form. it tries to deliver a message and it actually succeeds doing so in the most authentic way i can imagine. even more so than "taxi driver" which used a lot more theatrical elements to create more of a movie experience rather than "kids" which i personally think is almost like a documentary. aside from this, i think i just fit the generation that is portrait in this movie and i know how accurate and authentic it is. don't misinterpret me though. i don't have aids, i didn't f... any virgin and i never beat anybody up. but i feel like i am part of this generation and this is why i feel this movie did a awesome job capturing this generation, this momentum.

    You can look at the film Kids in a lot of different ways. Maybe it's a film for teenagers. Maybe it's a film for adults. Maybe both. A film that came out in 1995 and never really never got a chance. A difficult film with an uncomfortable subject but that is why it works. Directed by controversial director Larry Clark, Kids from 1995 was originally given an NC-17 rating but was then released unrated. The plot tells the controversial story of a group of poor teens who's life consists of mostly drugs, alcohol, sex and AIDS. The movie has a thin plot and even thinner character development. Even with these flaws, Clark is trying to depict a teen world that we don't usually see where these kids get away with a lot. I could relate a bit being with familiar with classmates who have similar problems. Some scenes are quite realistic and very hard to watch but many of the actions have very real consequences. This is a film that could only be made by a director with an attitude and a lot of confidence and Clark has that. I found the New York City setting to be very real and effective. This is a setting we've seen quite a bit but here New York City is not glamorous but is gritty, run down with a dangerous feel to it. Not the New York City we usually see in movies. The setting is very effective and helps makes the story. Kids is an interesting movie that depicts the dangers of our world and is a wake-up call to parents. It is probably one of the most controversial films of it's time and for an audience of the right age, it is a must-see.

    I am a big fan of harmony korine's films. i find that he pushes the boundaries of ordinary cinema but still manages to appeal to a wide audience. i have often found that with his films, you either love them, or you hate them. It was recommended to me by a friend who claimed there to be a twist at the end of the film, obviously this got me hyped up and was probably what drove me to watch it, but it turned out it wasn't everything my friend had made it out to be. This was probably what left me disappointed with the film. overall I still enjoyed it. I found that it picked up on some very realistic issues and was definitely a well thought out film. For what it was i think it was definitely pushed to the maximum potential it could of achieved. I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy indie films or if you're just looking for something a bit different from what you usually watch.

    In cinema verite style "Kids" invites us into the lives of sex-driven teenagers crazed on scoring, addicted to cussing and verging on self-destructive practises. Bound to big controversy when first released due to its explicit nature, which involves sexual promiscuity, including date rape, and drinking / drug binges of minors, some barely out of puberty, the movie still packs a punch out of the blue, suggesting how break-through the movie still is. Verging on a exploitational, not withstanding the young age of the scriptwriter, through its naturalistic quasi-documentary storytelling "Kids" attempts to convey a sense of teenage frustration and reality as verging on nihilistic and devoid of wider purpose. Through the extrapolated portrayals many viewed the movie as a wake-up call for American parents, whereas it seems more like preaching to the choir, the repetitive belief, that this generation is more depraved then 'back in the days'. The amoral behaviour of kid characters is suggested to be representative of the wider population, but essentially shows a certain fragment of it, maybe not marginal, but certainly dysfunctional and a minority. Sacrificing reality with shock factor and sensatonalism, dimishes the overall worth, also misleading the audience as to the real state of the youth, subverting certain reviewers to gasp in baseless shock as to modern-day teenagers. Backed with then unknown actors Larry Clark however manages to introduce a sense of dramatic realism, which despite not playing as a moral compass, points out to issues rarely portrayed / touched in contemporary cinema, but one so basic as the hormonal storms of adolescence, coupled with the relatively recent change in perceptions of adulthood. Since the XIX century concepts of age of sexual initiation dramatically changed increasing the age of consensual intercourse, naturally without altering natural sexual tendencies at age 14-17. After a period of hypocritical chastity enforced by parents on youth, for years now we have entered a phase of individualistic self-realisation among kids, but devoid of the moral compass of parents often too detached to understand the necessities of constructive parenthood. Despite its many flaws "Kids" still remains poignant, despite no soliloquy on morality to point a direction, just as a warning sign to parents as to societal risks in peer groups and the tough educational input needed to help guide through this emotionally rampant phase of growing up.

    I saw this movie many years ago, I was probably 18 at the time and I never forgot Talie's face, the disgusting kid, nor the last scene. a couple of days ago, I was at a friends house and she had this DVD and I was like 'hum, I know this guy, but where do I know him from?'. I honestly thought I'd met him in real life, thats how this stuck to my memory. I never socialised with kids like these, but they exist all around us. I remember a girl in my school who was 13 and having sex with lots of people and drove one of my neighbours to suicide cause she dumped him for another kid. He was 14. she and a friend were later expelled from school for urinating in the class. One of my cousins used to hang out with skateboarders and one of his friends died of overdose age 21. they pretty much looked like the group in this movie language and clothes wise. I also met a guy in my hall in Uni who was basically getting laid with every girl he could get his hands on, really disgusting. But what is really shocking about this movie is the reality of aids. and the darkness of the last scene where immorality and irresponsibility turn into creepy stuff like disease, crime and homelessness. It will stay with you for life.

    I was fourteen when this movie came out and spent pretty much all my free time skateboarding, so when i first caught the preview it intrigued me based on the skating alone. I knew who Harold Hunter was and thought it was going to be a movie about skating, only hitch is that it's NC-17. When this came out i wanted to see it so badly i didn't care what lengths that meant going to. So i asked my mom if she would take me! What a colossal mistake, i couldn't think of a more uncomfortable movie to see with a parent or authority figure. The first ten minute make-out to sex scene was gutt wrenching. My mom wanted to leave right away, she leaned over and said "let's go" but i was unable to move, this was around the time in my life when i was so defiant i would sit in a crowded movie theater with my mom while basically a cheap porno was playing, and still refuse to leave. So the entire movie revolves around one kid with AIDS who has a fetish for young virgins, and his miscellaneous crew including a young Rosario Dawson as they navigate mid-nineties New York. Partying, pool hopping, robbery, rape, drugs, beat-downs, it's just another day in the big apple! The movie plays out in almost documentary fashion while the audience is subjected to the unfortunate saga of a young man with a raging disease who basically rapes one girl after another. It's magnified reality to my poor mother who i dragged to the movie then refused to leave. It was way to much, she accosted me in the parking lot "why did you take me to that movie" i told her "i thought it was about skateboarding!?" she replies "the only skateboarding i saw was when they beat that man to death!". Shocked, i didn't see another movie with my mom until Spiderman 3 which was another exercise in horrible movie making. Only on a different level of course.

    So many scenes in Larry Clark's Kids are immoral and reprehensible that naming them all would eventually birth a list. The film, itself, is a remarkable piece, but the dialog in it is harsh, degrading, yet such a common standard today that it sadly seems like the norm. Filmed and released in 1995, it was certainly ahead of its time, and it's safe to say that things haven't gotten any better for society. Consistent readers will know that I love films with sharp, inviting social commentary on our world. I recently awarded three and a half stars to Bobcat Goldthwait's remarkably sharp film God Bless America, about a man and a young girl taking a loaded gun to things they have a disdain for in the world, such as empty-headed celebrities and hate-spreading political commentators. I awarded the same amount of stars to Falling Down, with Michael Douglas, another brilliantly crafted exercise providing a stern lecture on the arrogance of our world. And now, here is Kids, which comes straight out of left field for me. It is a poignantly made picture chronicling the lives of societal degenerates as they hopelessly wander the streets of New York City, unaccompanied and unprotected from the grittiness that lies ahead. Our "protagonist" is sixteen year old Telly (Fitzpatrick). The film opens with him kissing a twelve year old girl, and it eventually leads to sex after Telly forces the reluctant youth. He gives her the "I care about you" spiel, as he desperately wants to be the one to take her virginity. The inevitable happens, and afterwards, he meets his pal Casper (Justin Pierce) outside where he heartlessly discusses, in explicit detail, sex with the youth. Words fly to the viewer like bullets in a shootout, and we see the two casually walk up the city block, where they talk loud, shout obscenities, maybe shoplift a bottle of malt liquor, etc. Casper tells Telly that if he were to die tomorrow, he'd be remembered by the girls whose virginity he took for fifty plus years. Kids follows their footsteps in a "day in the life" kind of fashion. The two go to a drug-dealer's house, have a few hits off a joint, go to a party, get drunk, force each other to answer uncomfortable questions, etc, all in a parent-less, soulless environment. The subplot involves a group of girls, where the film decides to focus on two of them. One of them is HIV negative Ruby (Rosario Dawson in a stunningly offbeat role), who has had sex eight times. The other is HIV positive Jenny (Chlo&euml; Sevigny); she had sex once, with Telly. Jenny is sickened with anger and sadness, and drearily plods her way through the day at nightclubs and contemplates what will come of her future with this mishap. The film paints a tragic portrait of American youth. What's worse is the ignorance from parents. Telly stops quickly at his decrepit apartment to steal cash from his mother, kick his cat, and continue to take advantage of his life in a relentless fashion. What spawned such shocking behavior? Most likely years of careless parenting and neglect. His parents, we only see his mother, are hopelessly ignorant towards the fact their son is the degenerate from hell, having sex with young girls for temporary gratification. They ask no questions, possibly because they fear such answers. A shallow, yet common, example of parenting. What a remarkably sad picture this is. What an extremely well written one it is as well. Coming from someone still in school, a lot of it has been heard from me, yet thankfully not endured. It was penned by Harmony Korine, who also made a film I vow to never see. If the film proves anything, it proves that kids need to be taught to formulate an understanding of vital things such as art, philosophy, politics, and film itself. They need to be shown such mediums in order for sustainable growth to occur. My grandmother brought up a point about the vastly growing unemployment rate in America recently, and I think it's one that fits perfectly with this film; "how do you expect to have a thriving country when you have louses inhabiting it?" Starring: Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce, Chlo&euml; Sevigny, and Rosario Dawson. Directed by: Larry Clark.

    Looking to be depressed for an hour and a half? I have a perfect solution. Watch Kids and you will seek out the nearest bridge and take a flying leap into the abyss. It begins with a 17 year old boy named Telly making out with a 12 year old girl, trying to convince her that it is time to lose her virginity. He is successful in his mission and tells his friend Casper about the deflowering. They then shoplift booze from a local store, go home, smoke some pot, and inhale nitrous oxide from balloons. They meet more young girls and engage in graphic sexual conversations. One of the promiscuous lolitas has tested positive for HIV aids but continues to have unprotected sexual relations. The kids are young and think that they will live forever. No one seems to have any parental supervision at any point in this grim outlook on today's inner city youth.

    This movie accurately portrayed a lifestyle back then. I was a senior in high school when this came out and although we lived in New Haven and not New York, the group of people I knew, dressed like them, talked like them, boarded and were ravers. To me when I watch this movie, it's like watching my life when I was 17, without the HIV part of course. I love this movie and I think it's one of the most accurate, best ever made on the subject of youth. This and Thirteen as well. Both are very realistic. We don't like to admit that kids are doing these things like drugs, being promiscuous and skipping school to get high. But it's how it is happening in many cities not just New York. This movie is not promoting this lifestyle, it's simply giving an accurate portrayal into the lives of a group of skaters/ravers, and how life was for them back in the 90's.

    This is not a super super film, but it stays with you, which was sort of the point - especially if you saw it at the time it was released, before the onslaught of "dark" teen movies over the decade following. This was the granddaddy of the genre and remains one of the darkest and grittiest of them all, in both subject and style. Perhaps in part because the subjects were an urban group of kids, rather than the angsty suburban set we've grown accustomed to seeing, there is a rare and truthful ferocity to the characterizations. The emotive mechanism isn't their redemption as mere children, but their total fallibility as young adults. Though obviously this represents a small sample of teenagers in the united states, it will make you think twice about how much earlier we seem to lose our childhood these days. Great ensemble cast with very believable performances. Its attempt to approximate the reality of a documentary is a unique success. In addition to stong dialogue and direction, credit should be given to the cast for that; obviously, chloe sevigny was a standout here. A really important subject for its time and a very credible portrayal.

    You can look at the film Kids in a lot of different ways. Maybe it's a film for teenagers. Maybe it's a film for adults. Maybe both.

I recently awarded three and a half stars to Bobcat Goldthwait's remarkably sharp film God Bless America, about a man and a young girl taking a loaded gun to things they have a disdain for in the world, such as empty-headed celebrities and hate-spreading political commentators. I awarded the same amount of stars to Falling Down, with Michael Douglas, another brilliantly crafted exercise providing a stern lecture on the arrogance of our world. And now, here is Kids, which comes straight out of left field for me. It is a poignantly made picture chronicling the lives of societal degenerates as they hopelessly wander the streets of New York City, unaccompanied and unprotected from the grittiness that lies ahead. Our "protagonist" is sixteen year old Telly (Fitzpatrick). The film opens with him kissing a twelve year old girl, and it eventually leads to sex after Telly forces the reluctant youth. He gives her the "I care about you" spiel, as he desperately wants to be the one to take her virginity. The inevitable happens, and afterwards, he meets his pal Casper (Justin Pierce) outside where he heartlessly discusses, in explicit detail, sex with the youth. Words fly to the viewer like bullets in a shootout, and we see the two casually walk up the city block, where they talk loud, shout obscenities, maybe shoplift a bottle of malt liquor, etc. Casper tells Telly that if he were to die tomorrow, he'd be remembered by the girls whose virginity he took for fifty plus years. Kids follows their footsteps in a "day in the life" kind of fashion. The two go to a drug-dealer's house, have a few hits off a joint, go to a party, get drunk, force each other to answer uncomfortable questions, etc, all in a parent-less, soulless environment. The subplot involves a group of girls, where the film decides to focus on two of them. One of them is HIV negative Ruby (Rosario Dawson in a stunningly offbeat role), who has had sex eight times. The other is HIV positive Jenny (Chlo&euml; Sevigny); she had sex once, with Telly. Jenny is sickened with anger and sadness, and drearily plods her way through the day at nightclubs and contemplates what will come of her future with this mishap. The film paints a tragic portrait of American youth. What's worse is the ignorance from parents. Telly stops quickly at his decrepit apartment to steal cash from his mother, kick his cat, and continue to take advantage of his life in a relentless fashion. What spawned such shocking behavior? Most likely years of careless parenting and neglect. His parents, we only see his mother, are hopelessly ignorant towards the fact their son is the degenerate from hell, having sex with young girls for temporary gratification. They ask no questions, possibly because they fear such answers. A shallow, yet common, example of parenting. What a remarkably sad picture this is. What an extremely well written one it is as well. Coming from someone still in school, a lot of it has been heard from me, yet thankfully not endured. It was penned by Harmony Korine, who also made a film I vow to never see. If the film proves anything, it proves that kids need to be taught to formulate an understanding of vital things such as art, philosophy, politics, and film itself. They need to be shown such mediums in order for sustainable growth to occur. My grandmother brought up a point about the vastly growing unemployment rate in America recently, and I think it's one that fits perfectly with this film; "how do you expect to have a thriving country when you have louses inhabiting it?" Starring: Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce, Chlo&euml; Sevigny, and Rosario Dawson. Directed by: Larry Clark.

    Looking to be depressed for an hour and a half? I have a perfect solution. Watch Kids and you will seek out the nearest bridge and take a flying leap into the abyss. It begins with a 17 year old boy named Telly making out with a 12 year old girl, trying to convince her that it is time to lose her virginity. He is successful in his mission and tells his friend Casper about the deflowering. They then shoplift booze from a local store, go home, smoke some pot, and inhale nitrous oxide from balloons. They meet more young girls and engage in graphic sexual conversations. One of the promiscuous lolitas has tested positive for HIV aids but continues to have unprotected sexual relations. The kids are young and think that they will live forever. No one seems to have any parental supervision at any point in this grim outlook on today's inner city youth.

    This movie accurately portrayed a lifestyle back then. I was a senior in high school when this came out and although we lived in New Haven and not New York, the group of people I knew, dressed like them, talked like them, boarded and were ravers. To me when I watch this movie, it's like watching my life when I was 17, without the HIV part of course. I love this movie and I think it's one of the most accurate, best ever made on the subject of youth. This and Thirteen as well. Both are very realistic. We don't like to admit that kids are doing these things like drugs, being promiscuous and skipping school to get high. But it's how it is happening in many cities not just New York. This movie is not promoting this lifestyle, it's simply giving an accurate portrayal into the lives of a group of skaters/ravers, and how life was for them back in the 90's.

    This is not a super super film, but it stays with you, which was sort of the point - especially if you saw it at the time it was released, before the onslaught of "dark" teen movies over the decade following. This was the granddaddy of the genre and remains one of the darkest and grittiest of them all, in both subject and style. Perhaps in part because the subjects were an urban group of kids, rather than the angsty suburban set we've grown accustomed to seeing, there is a rare and truthful ferocity to the characterizations. The emotive mechanism isn't their redemption as mere children, but their total fallibility as young adults. Though obviously this represents a small sample of teenagers in the united states, it will make you think twice about how much earlier we seem to lose our childhood these days. Great ensemble cast with very believable performances. Its attempt to approximate the reality of a documentary is a unique success. In addition to stong dialogue and direction, credit should be given to the cast for that; obviously, chloe sevigny was a standout here. A really important subject for its time and a very credible portrayal.

    this is my first "review" on IMDb and i would like to underline that it's a result of unjustified negativity towards this movie. the movie "kids" is kind of a testament to a certain generation. just like the movie "taxi driver" is to another generation, or merely a different span in time. i cannot comprehend why anyone would rate this movie negative in any way shape or form. it tries to deliver a message and it actually succeeds doing so in the most authentic way i can imagine. even more so than "taxi driver" which used a lot more theatrical elements to create more of a movie experience rather than "kids" which i personally think is almost like a documentary. aside from this, i think i just fit the generation that is portrait in this movie and i know how accurate and authentic it is. don't misinterpret me though. i don't have aids, i didn't f... any virgin and i never beat anybody up. but i feel like i am part of this generation and this is why i feel this movie did a awesome job capturing this generation, this momentum.

    You can look at the film Kids in a lot of different ways. Maybe it's a film for teenagers. Maybe it's a film for adults. Maybe both. A film that came out in 1995 and never really never got a chance. A difficult film with an uncomfortable subject but that is why it works. Directed by controversial director Larry Clark, Kids from 1995 was originally given an NC-17 rating but was then released unrated. The plot tells the controversial story of a group of poor teens who's life consists of mostly drugs, alcohol, sex and AIDS. The movie has a thin plot and even thinner character development. Even with these flaws, Clark is trying to depict a teen world that we don't usually see where these kids get away with a lot. I could relate a bit being with familiar with classmates who have similar problems. Some scenes are quite realistic and very hard to watch but many of the actions have very real consequences. This is a film that could only be made by a director with an attitude and a lot of confidence and Clark has that. I found the New York City setting to be very real and effective. This is a setting we've seen quite a bit but here New York City is not glamorous but is gritty, run down with a dangerous feel to it. Not the New York City we usually see in movies. The setting is very effective and helps makes the story. Kids is an interesting movie that depicts the dangers of our world and is a wake-up call to parents. It is probably one of the most controversial films of it's time and for an audience of the right age, it is a must-see.

    I am a big fan of harmony korine's films. i find that he pushes the boundaries of ordinary cinema but still manages to appeal to a wide audience. i have often found that with his films, you either love them, or you hate them. It was recommended to me by a friend who claimed there to be a twist at the end of the film, obviously this got me hyped up and was probably what drove me to watch it, but it turned out it wasn't everything my friend had made it out to be. This was probably what left me disappointed with the film. overall I still enjoyed it. I found that it picked up on some very realistic issues and was definitely a well thought out film. For what it was i think it was definitely pushed to the maximum potential it could of achieved. I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy indie films or if you're just looking for something a bit different from what you usually watch.

    In cinema verite style "Kids" invites us into the lives of sex-driven teenagers crazed on scoring, addicted to cussing and verging on self-destructive practises. Bound to big controversy when first released due to its explicit nature, which involves sexual promiscuity, including date rape, and drinking / drug binges of minors, some barely out of puberty, the movie still packs a punch out of the blue, suggesting how break-through the movie still is. Verging on a exploitational, not withstanding the young age of the scriptwriter, through its naturalistic quasi-documentary storytelling "Kids" attempts to convey a sense of teenage frustration and reality as verging on nihilistic and devoid of wider purpose. Through the extrapolated portrayals many viewed the movie as a wake-up call for American parents, whereas it seems more like preaching to the choir, the repetitive belief, that this generation is more depraved then 'back in the days'. The amoral behaviour of kid characters is suggested to be representative of the wider population, but essentially shows a certain fragment of it, maybe not marginal, but certainly dysfunctional and a minority. Sacrificing reality with shock factor and sensatonalism, dimishes the overall worth, also misleading the audience as to the real state of the youth, subverting certain reviewers to gasp in baseless shock as to modern-day teenagers. Backed with then unknown actors Larry Clark however manages to introduce a sense of dramatic realism, which despite not playing as a moral compass, points out to issues rarely portrayed / touched in contemporary cinema, but one so basic as the hormonal storms of adolescence, coupled with the relatively recent change in perceptions of adulthood. Since the XIX century concepts of age of sexual initiation dramatically changed increasing the age of consensual intercourse, naturally without altering natural sexual tendencies at age 14-17. After a period of hypocritical chastity enforced by parents on youth, for years now we have entered a phase of individualistic self-realisation among kids, but devoid of the moral compass of parents often too detached to understand the necessities of constructive parenthood. Despite its many flaws "Kids" still remains poignant, despite no soliloquy on morality to point a direction, just as a warning sign to parents as to societal risks in peer groups and the tough educational input needed to help guide through this emotionally rampant phase of growing up.

    I saw this movie many years ago, I was probably 18 at the time and I never forgot Talie's face, the disgusting kid, nor the last scene. a couple of days ago, I was at a friends house and she had this DVD and I was like 'hum, I know this guy, but where do I know him from?'. I honestly thought I'd met him in real life, thats how this stuck to my memory. I never socialised with kids like these, but they exist all around us. I remember a girl in my school who was 13 and having sex with lots of people and drove one of my neighbours to suicide cause she dumped him for another kid. He was 14. she and a friend were later expelled from school for urinating in the class. One of my cousins used to hang out with skateboarders and one of his friends died of overdose age 21. they pretty much looked like the group in this movie language and clothes wise. I also met a guy in my hall in Uni who was basically getting laid with every girl he could get his hands on, really disgusting. But what is really shocking about this movie is the reality of aids. and the darkness of the last scene where immorality and irresponsibility turn into creepy stuff like disease, crime and homelessness. It will stay with you for life.

    I was fourteen when this movie came out and spent pretty much all my free time skateboarding, so when i first caught the preview it intrigued me based on the skating alone. I knew who Harold Hunter was and thought it was going to be a movie about skating, only hitch is that it's NC-17. When this came out i wanted to see it so badly i didn't care what lengths that meant going to. So i asked my mom if she would take me! What a colossal mistake, i couldn't think of a more uncomfortable movie to see with a parent or authority figure. The first ten minute make-out to sex scene was gutt wrenching. My mom wanted to leave right away, she leaned over and said "let's go" but i was unable to move, this was around the time in my life when i was so defiant i would sit in a crowded movie theater with my mom while basically a cheap porno was playing, and still refuse to leave. So the entire movie revolves around one kid with AIDS who has a fetish for young virgins, and his miscellaneous crew including a young Rosario Dawson as they navigate mid-nineties New York. Partying, pool hopping, robbery, rape, drugs, beat-downs, it's just another day in the big apple! The movie plays out in almost documentary fashion while the audience is subjected to the unfortunate saga of a young man with a raging disease who basically rapes one girl after another. It's magnified reality to my poor mother who i dragged to the movie then refused to leave. It was way to much, she accosted me in the parking lot "why did you take me to that movie" i told her "i thought it was about skateboarding!?" she replies "the only skateboarding i saw was when they beat that man to death!". Shocked, i didn't see another movie with my mom until Spiderman 3 which was another exercise in horrible movie making. Only on a different level of course.

    So many scenes in Larry Clark's Kids are immoral and reprehensible that naming them all would eventually birth a list. The film, itself, is a remarkable piece, but the dialog in it is harsh, degrading, yet such a common standard today that it sadly seems like the norm. Filmed and released in 1995, it was certainly ahead of its time, and it's safe to say that things haven't gotten any better for society. Consistent readers will know that I love films with sharp, inviting social commentary on our world. I recently awarded three and a half stars to Bobcat Goldthwait's remarkably sharp film God Bless America, about a man and a young girl taking a loaded gun to things they have a disdain for in the world, such as empty-headed celebrities and hate-spreading political commentators. I awarded the same amount of stars to Falling Down, with Michael Douglas, another brilliantly crafted exercise providing a stern lecture on the arrogance of our world. And now, here is Kids, which comes straight out of left field for me. It is a poignantly made picture chronicling the lives of societal degenerates as they hopelessly wander the streets of New York City, unaccompanied and unprotected from the grittiness that lies ahead.

The inevitable happens, and afterwards, he meets his pal Casper (Justin Pierce) outside where he heartlessly discusses, in explicit detail, sex with the youth. Words fly to the viewer like bullets in a shootout, and we see the two casually walk up the city block, where they talk loud, shout obscenities, maybe shoplift a bottle of malt liquor, etc. Casper tells Telly that if he were to die tomorrow, he'd be remembered by the girls whose virginity he took for fifty plus years. Kids follows their footsteps in a "day in the life" kind of fashion.

Backed with then unknown actors Larry Clark however manages to introduce a sense of dramatic realism, which despite not playing as a moral compass, points out to issues rarely portrayed / touched in contemporary cinema, but one so basic as the hormonal storms of adolescence, coupled with the relatively recent change in perceptions of adulthood. Since the XIX century concepts of age of sexual initiation dramatically changed increasing the age of consensual intercourse, naturally without altering natural sexual tendencies at age 14-17. After a period of hypocritical chastity enforced by parents on youth, for years now we have entered a phase of individualistic self-realisation among kids, but devoid of the moral compass of parents often too detached to understand the necessities of constructive parenthood. Despite its many flaws "Kids" still remains poignant, despite no soliloquy on morality to point a direction, just as a warning sign to parents as to societal risks in peer groups and the tough educational input needed to help guide through this emotionally rampant phase of growing up.

    I saw this movie many years ago, I was probably 18 at the time and I never forgot Talie's face, the disgusting kid, nor the last scene. a couple of days ago, I was at a friends house and she had this DVD and I was like 'hum, I know this guy, but where do I know him from?'. I honestly thought I'd met him in real life, thats how this stuck to my memory. I never socialised with kids like these, but they exist all around us. I remember a girl in my school who was 13 and having sex with lots of people and drove one of my neighbours to suicide cause she dumped him for another kid. He was 14. she and a friend were later expelled from school for urinating in the class. One of my cousins used to hang out with skateboarders and one of his friends died of overdose age 21. they pretty much looked like the group in this movie language and clothes wise. I also met a guy in my hall in Uni who was basically getting laid with every girl he could get his hands on, really disgusting. But what is really shocking about this movie is the reality of aids. and the darkness of the last scene where immorality and irresponsibility turn into creepy stuff like disease, crime and homelessness. It will stay with you for life.

    I was fourteen when this movie came out and spent pretty much all my free time skateboarding, so when i first caught the preview it intrigued me based on the skating alone. I knew who Harold Hunter was and thought it was going to be a movie about skating, only hitch is that it's NC-17. When this came out i wanted to see it so badly i didn't care what lengths that meant going to. So i asked my mom if she would take me! What a colossal mistake, i couldn't think of a more uncomfortable movie to see with a parent or authority figure. The first ten minute make-out to sex scene was gutt wrenching. My mom wanted to leave right away, she leaned over and said "let's go" but i was unable to move, this was around the time in my life when i was so defiant i would sit in a crowded movie theater with my mom while basically a cheap porno was playing, and still refuse to leave. So the entire movie revolves around one kid with AIDS who has a fetish for young virgins, and his miscellaneous crew including a young Rosario Dawson as they navigate mid-nineties New York. Partying, pool hopping, robbery, rape, drugs, beat-downs, it's just another day in the big apple! The movie plays out in almost documentary fashion while the audience is subjected to the unfortunate saga of a young man with a raging disease who basically rapes one girl after another. It's magnified reality to my poor mother who i dragged to the movie then refused to leave. It was way to much, she accosted me in the parking lot "why did you take me to that movie" i told her "i thought it was about skateboarding!?" she replies "the only skateboarding i saw was when they beat that man to death!". Shocked, i didn't see another movie with my mom until Spiderman 3 which was another exercise in horrible movie making. Only on a different level of course.

    So many scenes in Larry Clark's Kids are immoral and reprehensible that naming them all would eventually birth a list. The film, itself, is a remarkable piece, but the dialog in it is harsh, degrading, yet such a common standard today that it sadly seems like the norm. Filmed and released in 1995, it was certainly ahead of its time, and it's safe to say that things haven't gotten any better for society. Consistent readers will know that I love films with sharp, inviting social commentary on our world. I recently awarded three and a half stars to Bobcat Goldthwait's remarkably sharp film God Bless America, about a man and a young girl taking a loaded gun to things they have a disdain for in the world, such as empty-headed celebrities and hate-spreading political commentators. I awarded the same amount of stars to Falling Down, with Michael Douglas, another brilliantly crafted exercise providing a stern lecture on the arrogance of our world. And now, here is Kids, which comes straight out of left field for me. It is a poignantly made picture chronicling the lives of societal degenerates as they hopelessly wander the streets of New York City, unaccompanied and unprotected from the grittiness that lies ahead. Our "protagonist" is sixteen year old Telly (Fitzpatrick). The film opens with him kissing a twelve year old girl, and it eventually leads to sex after Telly forces the reluctant youth. He gives her the "I care about you" spiel, as he desperately wants to be the one to take her virginity. The inevitable happens, and afterwards, he meets his pal Casper (Justin Pierce) outside where he heartlessly discusses, in explicit detail, sex with the youth. Words fly to the viewer like bullets in a shootout, and we see the two casually walk up the city block, where they talk loud, shout obscenities, maybe shoplift a bottle of malt liquor, etc. Casper tells Telly that if he were to die tomorrow, he'd be remembered by the girls whose virginity he took for fifty plus years. Kids follows their footsteps in a "day in the life" kind of fashion. The two go to a drug-dealer's house, have a few hits off a joint, go to a party, get drunk, force each other to answer uncomfortable questions, etc, all in a parent-less, soulless environment. The subplot involves a group of girls, where the film decides to focus on two of them. One of them is HIV negative Ruby (Rosario Dawson in a stunningly offbeat role), who has had sex eight times. The other is HIV positive Jenny (Chlo&euml; Sevigny); she had sex once, with Telly. Jenny is sickened with anger and sadness, and drearily plods her way through the day at nightclubs and contemplates what will come of her future with this mishap. The film paints a tragic portrait of American youth. What's worse is the ignorance from parents. Telly stops quickly at his decrepit apartment to steal cash from his mother, kick his cat, and continue to take advantage of his life in a relentless fashion. What spawned such shocking behavior? Most likely years of careless parenting and neglect. His parents, we only see his mother, are hopelessly ignorant towards the fact their son is the degenerate from hell, having sex with young girls for temporary gratification. They ask no questions, possibly because they fear such answers. A shallow, yet common, example of parenting. What a remarkably sad picture this is. What an extremely well written one it is as well. Coming from someone still in school, a lot of it has been heard from me, yet thankfully not endured. It was penned by Harmony Korine, who also made a film I vow to never see. If the film proves anything, it proves that kids need to be taught to formulate an understanding of vital things such as art, philosophy, politics, and film itself. They need to be shown such mediums in order for sustainable growth to occur. My grandmother brought up a point about the vastly growing unemployment rate in America recently, and I think it's one that fits perfectly with this film; "how do you expect to have a thriving country when you have louses inhabiting it?" Starring: Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce, Chlo&euml; Sevigny, and Rosario Dawson. Directed by: Larry Clark.

    Looking to be depressed for an hour and a half? I have a perfect solution. Watch Kids and you will seek out the nearest bridge and take a flying leap into the abyss. It begins with a 17 year old boy named Telly making out with a 12 year old girl, trying to convince her that it is time to lose her virginity. He is successful in his mission and tells his friend Casper about the deflowering. They then shoplift booze from a local store, go home, smoke some pot, and inhale nitrous oxide from balloons. They meet more young girls and engage in graphic sexual conversations. One of the promiscuous lolitas has tested positive for HIV aids but continues to have unprotected sexual relations. The kids are young and think that they will live forever. No one seems to have any parental supervision at any point in this grim outlook on today's inner city youth.

    This movie accurately portrayed a lifestyle back then. I was a senior in high school when this came out and although we lived in New Haven and not New York, the group of people I knew, dressed like them, talked like them, boarded and were ravers. To me when I watch this movie, it's like watching my life when I was 17, without the HIV part of course. I love this movie and I think it's one of the most accurate, best ever made on the subject of youth. This and Thirteen as well. Both are very realistic. We don't like to admit that kids are doing these things like drugs, being promiscuous and skipping school to get high. But it's how it is happening in many cities not just New York. This movie is not promoting this lifestyle, it's simply giving an accurate portrayal into the lives of a group of skaters/ravers, and how life was for them back in the 90's.

    This is not a super super film, but it stays with you, which was sort of the point - especially if you saw it at the time it was released, before the onslaught of "dark" teen movies over the decade following. This was the granddaddy of the genre and remains one of the darkest and grittiest of them all, in both subject and style. Perhaps in part because the subjects were an urban group of kids, rather than the angsty suburban set we've grown accustomed to seeing, there is a rare and truthful ferocity to the characterizations. The emotive mechanism isn't their redemption as mere children, but their total fallibility as young adults. Though obviously this represents a small sample of teenagers in the united states, it will make you think twice about how much earlier we seem to lose our childhood these days. Great ensemble cast with very believable performances. Its attempt to approximate the reality of a documentary is a unique success. In addition to stong dialogue and direction, credit should be given to the cast for that; obviously, chloe sevigny was a standout here. A really important subject for its time and a very credible portrayal.

    this is my first "review" on IMDb and i would like to underline that it's a result of unjustified negativity towards this movie. the movie "kids" is kind of a testament to a certain generation. just like the movie "taxi driver" is to another generation, or merely a different span in time. i cannot comprehend why anyone would rate this movie negative in any way shape or form. it tries to deliver a message and it actually succeeds doing so in the most authentic way i can imagine. even more so than "taxi driver" which used a lot more theatrical elements to create more of a movie experience rather than "kids" which i personally think is almost like a documentary. aside from this, i think i just fit the generation that is portrait in this movie and i know how accurate and authentic it is. don't misinterpret me though. i don't have aids, i didn't f... any virgin and i never beat anybody up. but i feel like i am part of this generation and this is why i feel this movie did a awesome job capturing this generation, this momentum.

    You can look at the film Kids in a lot of different ways. Maybe it's a film for teenagers. Maybe it's a film for adults. Maybe both. A film that came out in 1995 and never really never got a chance. A difficult film with an uncomfortable subject but that is why it works. Directed by controversial director Larry Clark, Kids from 1995 was originally given an NC-17 rating but was then released unrated. The plot tells the controversial story of a group of poor teens who's life consists of mostly drugs, alcohol, sex and AIDS. The movie has a thin plot and even thinner character development. Even with these flaws, Clark is trying to depict a teen world that we don't usually see where these kids get away with a lot. I could relate a bit being with familiar with classmates who have similar problems. Some scenes are quite realistic and very hard to watch but many of the actions have very real consequences. This is a film that could only be made by a director with an attitude and a lot of confidence and Clark has that. I found the New York City setting to be very real and effective. This is a setting we've seen quite a bit but here New York City is not glamorous but is gritty, run down with a dangerous feel to it. Not the New York City we usually see in movies. The setting is very effective and helps makes the story. Kids is an interesting movie that depicts the dangers of our world and is a wake-up call to parents. It is probably one of the most controversial films of it's time and for an audience of the right age, it is a must-see.

    I am a big fan of harmony korine's films. i find that he pushes the boundaries of ordinary cinema but still manages to appeal to a wide audience. i have often found that with his films, you either love them, or you hate them. It was recommended to me by a friend who claimed there to be a twist at the end of the film, obviously this got me hyped up and was probably what drove me to watch it, but it turned out it wasn't everything my friend had made it out to be. This was probably what left me disappointed with the film. overall I still enjoyed it. I found that it picked up on some very realistic issues and was definitely a well thought out film. For what it was i think it was definitely pushed to the maximum potential it could of achieved. I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy indie films or if you're just looking for something a bit different from what you usually watch.

    In cinema verite style "Kids" invites us into the lives of sex-driven teenagers crazed on scoring, addicted to cussing and verging on self-destructive practises. Bound to big controversy when first released due to its explicit nature, which involves sexual promiscuity, including date rape, and drinking / drug binges of minors, some barely out of puberty, the movie still packs a punch out of the blue, suggesting how break-through the movie still is. Verging on a exploitational, not withstanding the young age of the scriptwriter, through its naturalistic quasi-documentary storytelling "Kids" attempts to convey a sense of teenage frustration and reality as verging on nihilistic and devoid of wider purpose. Through the extrapolated portrayals many viewed the movie as a wake-up call for American parents, whereas it seems more like preaching to the choir, the repetitive belief, that this generation is more depraved then 'back in the days'. The amoral behaviour of kid characters is suggested to be representative of the wider population, but essentially shows a certain fragment of it, maybe not marginal, but certainly dysfunctional and a minority. Sacrificing reality with shock factor and sensatonalism, dimishes the overall worth, also misleading the audience as to the real state of the youth, subverting certain reviewers to gasp in baseless shock as to modern-day teenagers. Backed with then unknown actors Larry Clark however manages to introduce a sense of dramatic realism, which despite not playing as a moral compass, points out to issues rarely portrayed / touched in contemporary cinema, but one so basic as the hormonal storms of adolescence, coupled with the relatively recent change in perceptions of adulthood.

After a period of hypocritical chastity enforced by parents on youth, for years now we have entered a phase of individualistic self-realisation among kids, but devoid of the moral compass of parents often too detached to understand the necessities of constructive parenthood. Despite its many flaws "Kids" still remains poignant, despite no soliloquy on morality to point a direction, just as a warning sign to parents as to societal risks in peer groups and the tough educational input needed to help guide through this emotionally rampant phase of growing up.

    this is my first "review" on IMDb and i would like to underline that it's a result of unjustified negativity towards this movie. the movie "kids" is kind of a testament to a certain generation. just like the movie "taxi driver" is to another generation, or merely a different span in time. i cannot comprehend why anyone would rate this movie negative in any way shape or form. it tries to deliver a message and it actually succeeds doing so in the most authentic way i can imagine. even more so than "taxi driver" which used a lot more theatrical elements to create more of a movie experience rather than "kids" which i personally think is almost like a documentary. aside from this, i think i just fit the generation that is portrait in this movie and i know how accurate and authentic it is. don't misinterpret me though. i don't have aids, i didn't f... any virgin and i never beat anybody up. but i feel like i am part of this generation and this is why i feel this movie did a awesome job capturing this generation, this momentum.

    You can look at the film Kids in a lot of different ways. Maybe it's a film for teenagers. Maybe it's a film for adults. Maybe both. A film that came out in 1995 and never really never got a chance. A difficult film with an uncomfortable subject but that is why it works. Directed by controversial director Larry Clark, Kids from 1995 was originally given an NC-17 rating but was then released unrated. The plot tells the controversial story of a group of poor teens who's life consists of mostly drugs, alcohol, sex and AIDS. The movie has a thin plot and even thinner character development. Even with these flaws, Clark is trying to depict a teen world that we don't usually see where these kids get away with a lot. I could relate a bit being with familiar with classmates who have similar problems. Some scenes are quite realistic and very hard to watch but many of the actions have very real consequences. This is a film that could only be made by a director with an attitude and a lot of confidence and Clark has that. I found the New York City setting to be very real and effective. This is a setting we've seen quite a bit but here New York City is not glamorous but is gritty, run down with a dangerous feel to it. Not the New York City we usually see in movies. The setting is very effective and helps makes the story. Kids is an interesting movie that depicts the dangers of our world and is a wake-up call to parents. It is probably one of the most controversial films of it's time and for an audience of the right age, it is a must-see.

    I am a big fan of harmony korine's films. i find that he pushes the boundaries of ordinary cinema but still manages to appeal to a wide audience. i have often found that with his films, you either love them, or you hate them. It was recommended to me by a friend who claimed there to be a twist at the end of the film, obviously this got me hyped up and was probably what drove me to watch it, but it turned out it wasn't everything my friend had made it out to be. This was probably what left me disappointed with the film. overall I still enjoyed it. I found that it picked up on some very realistic issues and was definitely a well thought out film. For what it was i think it was definitely pushed to the maximum potential it could of achieved. I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy indie films or if you're just looking for something a bit different from what you usually watch.

    In cinema verite style "Kids" invites us into the lives of sex-driven teenagers crazed on scoring, addicted to cussing and verging on self-destructive practises. Bound to big controversy when first released due to its explicit nature, which involves sexual promiscuity, including date rape, and drinking / drug binges of minors, some barely out of puberty, the movie still packs a punch out of the blue, suggesting how break-through the movie still is. Verging on a exploitational, not withstanding the young age of the scriptwriter, through its naturalistic quasi-documentary storytelling "Kids" attempts to convey a sense of teenage frustration and reality as verging on nihilistic and devoid of wider purpose. Through the extrapolated portrayals many viewed the movie as a wake-up call for American parents, whereas it seems more like preaching to the choir, the repetitive belief, that this generation is more depraved then 'back in the days'. The amoral behaviour of kid characters is suggested to be representative of the wider population, but essentially shows a certain fragment of it, maybe not marginal, but certainly dysfunctional and a minority. Sacrificing reality with shock factor and sensatonalism, dimishes the overall worth, also misleading the audience as to the real state of the youth, subverting certain reviewers to gasp in baseless shock as to modern-day teenagers. Backed with then unknown actors Larry Clark however manages to introduce a sense of dramatic realism, which despite not playing as a moral compass, points out to issues rarely portrayed / touched in contemporary cinema, but one so basic as the hormonal storms of adolescence, coupled with the relatively recent change in perceptions of adulthood. Since the XIX century concepts of age of sexual initiation dramatically changed increasing the age of consensual intercourse, naturally without altering natural sexual tendencies at age 14-17. After a period of hypocritical chastity enforced by parents on youth, for years now we have entered a phase of individualistic self-realisation among kids, but devoid of the moral compass of parents often too detached to understand the necessities of constructive parenthood. Despite its many flaws "Kids" still remains poignant, despite no soliloquy on morality to point a direction, just as a warning sign to parents as to societal risks in peer groups and the tough educational input needed to help guide through this emotionally rampant phase of growing up.

    I saw this movie many years ago, I was probably 18 at the time and I never forgot Talie's face, the disgusting kid, nor the last scene. a couple of days ago, I was at a friends house and she had this DVD and I was like 'hum, I know this guy, but where do I know him from?'. I honestly thought I'd met him in real life, thats how this stuck to my memory. I never socialised with kids like these, but they exist all around us. I remember a girl in my school who was 13 and having sex with lots of people and drove one of my neighbours to suicide cause she dumped him for another kid. He was 14. she and a friend were later expelled from school for urinating in the class. One of my cousins used to hang out with skateboarders and one of his friends died of overdose age 21. they pretty much looked like the group in this movie language and clothes wise. I also met a guy in my hall in Uni who was basically getting laid with every girl he could get his hands on, really disgusting. But what is really shocking about this movie is the reality of aids. and the darkness of the last scene where immorality and irresponsibility turn into creepy stuff like disease, crime and homelessness. It will stay with you for life.

    I was fourteen when this movie came out and spent pretty much all my free time skateboarding, so when i first caught the preview it intrigued me based on the skating alone. I knew who Harold Hunter was and thought it was going to be a movie about skating, only hitch is that it's NC-17. When this came out i wanted to see it so badly i didn't care what lengths that meant going to. So i asked my mom if she would take me! What a colossal mistake, i couldn't think of a more uncomfortable movie to see with a parent or authority figure. The first ten minute make-out to sex scene was gutt wrenching. My mom wanted to leave right away, she leaned over and said "let's go" but i was unable to move, this was around the time in my life when i was so defiant i would sit in a crowded movie theater with my mom while basically a cheap porno was playing, and still refuse to leave. So the entire movie revolves around one kid with AIDS who has a fetish for young virgins, and his miscellaneous crew including a young Rosario Dawson as they navigate mid-nineties New York. Partying, pool hopping, robbery, rape, drugs, beat-downs, it's just another day in the big apple! The movie plays out in almost documentary fashion while the audience is subjected to the unfortunate saga of a young man with a raging disease who basically rapes one girl after another. It's magnified reality to my poor mother who i dragged to the movie then refused to leave. It was way to much, she accosted me in the parking lot "why did you take me to that movie" i told her "i thought it was about skateboarding!?" she replies "the only skateboarding i saw was when they beat that man to death!". Shocked, i didn't see another movie with my mom until Spiderman 3 which was another exercise in horrible movie making. Only on a different level of course.

    So many scenes in Larry Clark's Kids are immoral and reprehensible that naming them all would eventually birth a list. The film, itself, is a remarkable piece, but the dialog in it is harsh, degrading, yet such a common standard today that it sadly seems like the norm. Filmed and released in 1995, it was certainly ahead of its time, and it's safe to say that things haven't gotten any better for society. Consistent readers will know that I love films with sharp, inviting social commentary on our world. I recently awarded three and a half stars to Bobcat Goldthwait's remarkably sharp film God Bless America, about a man and a young girl taking a loaded gun to things they have a disdain for in the world, such as empty-headed celebrities and hate-spreading political commentators. I awarded the same amount of stars to Falling Down, with Michael Douglas, another brilliantly crafted exercise providing a stern lecture on the arrogance of our world. And now, here is Kids, which comes straight out of left field for me. It is a poignantly made picture chronicling the lives of societal degenerates as they hopelessly wander the streets of New York City, unaccompanied and unprotected from the grittiness that lies ahead. Our "protagonist" is sixteen year old Telly (Fitzpatrick). The film opens with him kissing a twelve year old girl, and it eventually leads to sex after Telly forces the reluctant youth. He gives her the "I care about you" spiel, as he desperately wants to be the one to take her virginity. The inevitable happens, and afterwards, he meets his pal Casper (Justin Pierce) outside where he heartlessly discusses, in explicit detail, sex with the youth. Words fly to the viewer like bullets in a shootout, and we see the two casually walk up the city block, where they talk loud, shout obscenities, maybe shoplift a bottle of malt liquor, etc. Casper tells Telly that if he were to die tomorrow, he'd be remembered by the girls whose virginity he took for fifty plus years. Kids follows their footsteps in a "day in the life" kind of fashion. The two go to a drug-dealer's house, have a few hits off a joint, go to a party, get drunk, force each other to answer uncomfortable questions, etc, all in a parent-less, soulless environment. The subplot involves a group of girls, where the film decides to focus on two of them. One of them is HIV negative Ruby (Rosario Dawson in a stunningly offbeat role), who has had sex eight times. The other is HIV positive Jenny (Chlo&euml; Sevigny); she had sex once, with Telly. Jenny is sickened with anger and sadness, and drearily plods her way through the day at nightclubs and contemplates what will come of her future with this mishap. The film paints a tragic portrait of American youth. What's worse is the ignorance from parents. Telly stops quickly at his decrepit apartment to steal cash from his mother, kick his cat, and continue to take advantage of his life in a relentless fashion. What spawned such shocking behavior? Most likely years of careless parenting and neglect. His parents, we only see his mother, are hopelessly ignorant towards the fact their son is the degenerate from hell, having sex with young girls for temporary gratification. They ask no questions, possibly because they fear such answers. A shallow, yet common, example of parenting. What a remarkably sad picture this is. What an extremely well written one it is as well. Coming from someone still in school, a lot of it has been heard from me, yet thankfully not endured. It was penned by Harmony Korine, who also made a film I vow to never see. If the film proves anything, it proves that kids need to be taught to formulate an understanding of vital things such as art, philosophy, politics, and film itself. They need to be shown such mediums in order for sustainable growth to occur. My grandmother brought up a point about the vastly growing unemployment rate in America recently, and I think it's one that fits perfectly with this film; "how do you expect to have a thriving country when you have louses inhabiting it?" Starring: Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce, Chlo&euml; Sevigny, and Rosario Dawson. Directed by: Larry Clark.

    Looking to be depressed for an hour and a half? I have a perfect solution. Watch Kids and you will seek out the nearest bridge and take a flying leap into the abyss. It begins with a 17 year old boy named Telly making out with a 12 year old girl, trying to convince her that it is time to lose her virginity. He is successful in his mission and tells his friend Casper about the deflowering. They then shoplift booze from a local store, go home, smoke some pot, and inhale nitrous oxide from balloons. They meet more young girls and engage in graphic sexual conversations. One of the promiscuous lolitas has tested positive for HIV aids but continues to have unprotected sexual relations. The kids are young and think that they will live forever. No one seems to have any parental supervision at any point in this grim outlook on today's inner city youth.

    This movie accurately portrayed a lifestyle back then. I was a senior in high school when this came out and although we lived in New Haven and not New York, the group of people I knew, dressed like them, talked like them, boarded and were ravers. To me when I watch this movie, it's like watching my life when I was 17, without the HIV part of course. I love this movie and I think it's one of the most accurate, best ever made on the subject of youth. This and Thirteen as well. Both are very realistic. We don't like to admit that kids are doing these things like drugs, being promiscuous and skipping school to get high. But it's how it is happening in many cities not just New York. This movie is not promoting this lifestyle, it's simply giving an accurate portrayal into the lives of a group of skaters/ravers, and how life was for them back in the 90's.

    This is not a super super film, but it stays with you, which was sort of the point - especially if you saw it at the time it was released, before the onslaught of "dark" teen movies over the decade following. This was the granddaddy of the genre and remains one of the darkest and grittiest of them all, in both subject and style. Perhaps in part because the subjects were an urban group of kids, rather than the angsty suburban set we've grown accustomed to seeing, there is a rare and truthful ferocity to the characterizations. The emotive mechanism isn't their redemption as mere children, but their total fallibility as young adults. Though obviously this represents a small sample of teenagers in the united states, it will make you think twice about how much earlier we seem to lose our childhood these days. Great ensemble cast with very believable performances. Its attempt to approximate the reality of a documentary is a unique success. In addition to stong dialogue and direction, credit should be given to the cast for that; obviously, chloe sevigny was a standout here. A really important subject for its time and a very credible portrayal.

They ask no questions, possibly because they fear such answers. A shallow, yet common, example of parenting. What a remarkably sad picture this is. What an extremely well written one it is as well. Coming from someone still in school, a lot of it has been heard from me, yet thankfully not endured. It was penned by Harmony Korine, who also made a film I vow to never see. If the film proves anything, it proves that kids need to be taught to formulate an understanding of vital things such as art, philosophy, politics, and film itself. They need to be shown such mediums in order for sustainable growth to occur. My grandmother brought up a point about the vastly growing unemployment rate in America recently, and I think it's one that fits perfectly with this film; "how do you expect to have a thriving country when you have louses inhabiting it?" Starring: Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce, Chlo&euml; Sevigny, and Rosario Dawson. Directed by: Larry Clark.

    Looking to be depressed for an hour and a half? I have a perfect solution. Watch Kids and you will seek out the nearest bridge and take a flying leap into the abyss. It begins with a 17 year old boy named Telly making out with a 12 year old girl, trying to convince her that it is time to lose her virginity. He is successful in his mission and tells his friend Casper about the deflowering. They then shoplift booze from a local store, go home, smoke some pot, and inhale nitrous oxide from balloons. They meet more young girls and engage in graphic sexual conversations. One of the promiscuous lolitas has tested positive for HIV aids but continues to have unprotected sexual relations. The kids are young and think that they will live forever. No one seems to have any parental supervision at any point in this grim outlook on today's inner city youth.

    This movie accurately portrayed a lifestyle back then. I was a senior in high school when this came out and although we lived in New Haven and not New York, the group of people I knew, dressed like them, talked like them, boarded and were ravers. To me when I watch this movie, it's like watching my life when I was 17, without the HIV part of course. I love this movie and I think it's one of the most accurate, best ever made on the subject of youth. This and Thirteen as well. Both are very realistic. We don't like to admit that kids are doing these things like drugs, being promiscuous and skipping school to get high. But it's how it is happening in many cities not just New York. This movie is not promoting this lifestyle, it's simply giving an accurate portrayal into the lives of a group of skaters/ravers, and how life was for them back in the 90's.

    This is not a super super film, but it stays with you, which was sort of the point - especially if you saw it at the time it was released, before the onslaught of "dark" teen movies over the decade following. This was the granddaddy of the genre and remains one of the darkest and grittiest of them all, in both subject and style. Perhaps in part because the subjects were an urban group of kids, rather than the angsty suburban set we've grown accustomed to seeing, there is a rare and truthful ferocity to the characterizations. The emotive mechanism isn't their redemption as mere children, but their total fallibility as young adults. Though obviously this represents a small sample of teenagers in the united states, it will make you think twice about how much earlier we seem to lose our childhood these days. Great ensemble cast with very believable performances. Its attempt to approximate the reality of a documentary is a unique success. In addition to stong dialogue and direction, credit should be given to the cast for that; obviously, chloe sevigny was a standout here. A really important subject for its time and a very credible portrayal.

    this is my first "review" on IMDb and i would like to underline that it's a result of unjustified negativity towards this movie. the movie "kids" is kind of a testament to a certain generation. just like the movie "taxi driver" is to another generation, or merely a different span in time. i cannot comprehend why anyone would rate this movie negative in any way shape or form. it tries to deliver a message and it actually succeeds doing so in the most authentic way i can imagine. even more so than "taxi driver" which used a lot more theatrical elements to create more of a movie experience rather than "kids" which i personally think is almost like a documentary. aside from this, i think i just fit the generation that is portrait in this movie and i know how accurate and authentic it is. don't misinterpret me though. i don't have aids, i didn't f... any virgin and i never beat anybody up. but i feel like i am part of this generation and this is why i feel this movie did a awesome job capturing this generation, this momentum.

    You can look at the film Kids in a lot of different ways. Maybe it's a film for teenagers. Maybe it's a film for adults. Maybe both. A film that came out in 1995 and never really never got a chance. A difficult film with an uncomfortable subject but that is why it works. Directed by controversial director Larry Clark, Kids from 1995 was originally given an NC-17 rating but was then released unrated. The plot tells the controversial story of a group of poor teens who's life consists of mostly drugs, alcohol, sex and AIDS. The movie has a thin plot and even thinner character development. Even with these flaws, Clark is trying to depict a teen world that we don't usually see where these kids get away with a lot. I could relate a bit being with familiar with classmates who have similar problems. Some scenes are quite realistic and very hard to watch but many of the actions have very real consequences. This is a film that could only be made by a director with an attitude and a lot of confidence and Clark has that. I found the New York City setting to be very real and effective. This is a setting we've seen quite a bit but here New York City is not glamorous but is gritty, run down with a dangerous feel to it. Not the New York City we usually see in movies. The setting is very effective and helps makes the story. Kids is an interesting movie that depicts the dangers of our world and is a wake-up call to parents. It is probably one of the most controversial films of it's time and for an audience of the right age, it is a must-see.

    I am a big fan of harmony korine's films. i find that he pushes the boundaries of ordinary cinema but still manages to appeal to a wide audience. i have often found that with his films, you either love them, or you hate them. It was recommended to me by a friend who claimed there to be a twist at the end of the film, obviously this got me hyped up and was probably what drove me to watch it, but it turned out it wasn't everything my friend had made it out to be. This was probably what left me disappointed with the film. overall I still enjoyed it. I found that it picked up on some very realistic issues and was definitely a well thought out film. For what it was i think it was definitely pushed to the maximum potential it could of achieved. I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy indie films or if you're just looking for something a bit different from what you usually watch.

    In cinema verite style "Kids" invites us into the lives of sex-driven teenagers crazed on scoring, addicted to cussing and verging on self-destructive practises. Bound to big controversy when first released due to its explicit nature, which involves sexual promiscuity, including date rape, and drinking / drug binges of minors, some barely out of puberty, the movie still packs a punch out of the blue, suggesting how break-through the movie still is. Verging on a exploitational, not withstanding the young age of the scriptwriter, through its naturalistic quasi-documentary storytelling "Kids" attempts to convey a sense of teenage frustration and reality as verging on nihilistic and devoid of wider purpose. Through the extrapolated portrayals many viewed the movie as a wake-up call for American parents, whereas it seems more like preaching to the choir, the repetitive belief, that this generation is more depraved then 'back in the days'. The amoral behaviour of kid characters is suggested to be representative of the wider population, but essentially shows a certain fragment of it, maybe not marginal, but certainly dysfunctional and a minority. Sacrificing reality with shock factor and sensatonalism, dimishes the overall worth, also misleading the audience as to the real state of the youth, subverting certain reviewers to gasp in baseless shock as to modern-day teenagers. Backed with then unknown actors Larry Clark however manages to introduce a sense of dramatic realism, which despite not playing as a moral compass, points out to issues rarely portrayed / touched in contemporary cinema, but one so basic as the hormonal storms of adolescence, coupled with the relatively recent change in perceptions of adulthood. Since the XIX century concepts of age of sexual initiation dramatically changed increasing the age of consensual intercourse, naturally without altering natural sexual tendencies at age 14-17. After a period of hypocritical chastity enforced by parents on youth, for years now we have entered a phase of individualistic self-realisation among kids, but devoid of the moral compass of parents often too detached to understand the necessities of constructive parenthood. Despite its many flaws "Kids" still remains poignant, despite no soliloquy on morality to point a direction, just as a warning sign to parents as to societal risks in peer groups and the tough educational input needed to help guide through this emotionally rampant phase of growing up.

    I saw this movie many years ago, I was probably 18 at the time and I never forgot Talie's face, the disgusting kid, nor the last scene. a couple of days ago, I was at a friends house and she had this DVD and I was like 'hum, I know this guy, but where do I know him from?'. I honestly thought I'd met him in real life, thats how this stuck to my memory. I never socialised with kids like these, but they exist all around us. I remember a girl in my school who was 13 and having sex with lots of people and drove one of my neighbours to suicide cause she dumped him for another kid. He was 14. she and a friend were later expelled from school for urinating in the class. One of my cousins used to hang out with skateboarders and one of his friends died of overdose age 21. they pretty much looked like the group in this movie language and clothes wise. I also met a guy in my hall in Uni who was basically getting laid with every girl he could get his hands on, really disgusting. But what is really shocking about this movie is the reality of aids. and the darkness of the last scene where immorality and irresponsibility turn into creepy stuff like disease, crime and homelessness. It will stay with you for life.

    I was fourteen when this movie came out and spent pretty much all my free time skateboarding, so when i first caught the preview it intrigued me based on the skating alone. I knew who Harold Hunter was and thought it was going to be a movie about skating, only hitch is that it's NC-17. When this came out i wanted to see it so badly i didn't care what lengths that meant going to. So i asked my mom if she would take me! What a colossal mistake, i couldn't think of a more uncomfortable movie to see with a parent or authority figure. The first ten minute make-out to sex scene was gutt wrenching. My mom wanted to leave right away, she leaned over and said "let's go" but i was unable to move, this was around the time in my life when i was so defiant i would sit in a crowded movie theater with my mom while basically a cheap porno was playing, and still refuse to leave. So the entire movie revolves around one kid with AIDS who has a fetish for young virgins, and his miscellaneous crew including a young Rosario Dawson as they navigate mid-nineties New York. Partying, pool hopping, robbery, rape, drugs, beat-downs, it's just another day in the big apple! The movie plays out in almost documentary fashion while the audience is subjected to the unfortunate saga of a young man with a raging disease who basically rapes one girl after another. It's magnified reality to my poor mother who i dragged to the movie then refused to leave. It was way to much, she accosted me in the parking lot "why did you take me to that movie" i told her "i thought it was about skateboarding!?" she replies "the only skateboarding i saw was when they beat that man to death!". Shocked, i didn't see another movie with my mom until Spiderman 3 which was another exercise in horrible movie making. Only on a different level of course.

    So many scenes in Larry Clark's Kids are immoral and reprehensible that naming them all would eventually birth a list. The film, itself, is a remarkable piece, but the dialog in it is harsh, degrading, yet such a common standard today that it sadly seems like the norm. Filmed and released in 1995, it was certainly ahead of its time, and it's safe to say that things haven't gotten any better for society. Consistent readers will know that I love films with sharp, inviting social commentary on our world. I recently awarded three and a half stars to Bobcat Goldthwait's remarkably sharp film God Bless America, about a man and a young girl taking a loaded gun to things they have a disdain for in the world, such as empty-headed celebrities and hate-spreading political commentators. I awarded the same amount of stars to Falling Down, with Michael Douglas, another brilliantly crafted exercise providing a stern lecture on the arrogance of our world. And now, here is Kids, which comes straight out of left field for me. It is a poignantly made picture chronicling the lives of societal degenerates as they hopelessly wander the streets of New York City, unaccompanied and unprotected from the grittiness that lies ahead. Our "protagonist" is sixteen year old Telly (Fitzpatrick). The film opens with him kissing a twelve year old girl, and it eventually leads to sex after Telly forces the reluctant youth. He gives her the "I care about you" spiel, as he desperately wants to be the one to take her virginity. The inevitable happens, and afterwards, he meets his pal Casper (Justin Pierce) outside where he heartlessly discusses, in explicit detail, sex with the youth. Words fly to the viewer like bullets in a shootout, and we see the two casually walk up the city block, where they talk loud, shout obscenities, maybe shoplift a bottle of malt liquor, etc. Casper tells Telly that if he were to die tomorrow, he'd be remembered by the girls whose virginity he took for fifty plus years. Kids follows their footsteps in a "day in the life" kind of fashion. The two go to a drug-dealer's house, have a few hits off a joint, go to a party, get drunk, force each other to answer uncomfortable questions, etc, all in a parent-less, soulless environment. The subplot involves a group of girls, where the film decides to focus on two of them. One of them is HIV negative Ruby (Rosario Dawson in a stunningly offbeat role), who has had sex eight times. The other is HIV positive Jenny (Chlo&euml; Sevigny); she had sex once, with Telly. Jenny is sickened with anger and sadness, and drearily plods her way through the day at nightclubs and contemplates what will come of her future with this mishap. The film paints a tragic portrait of American youth. What's worse is the ignorance from parents. Telly stops quickly at his decrepit apartment to steal cash from his mother, kick his cat, and continue to take advantage of his life in a relentless fashion. What spawned such shocking behavior? Most likely years of careless parenting and neglect. His parents, we only see his mother, are hopelessly ignorant towards the fact their son is the degenerate from hell, having sex with young girls for temporary gratification. They ask no questions, possibly because they fear such answers. A shallow, yet common, example of parenting. What a remarkably sad picture this is. What an extremely well written one it is as well. Coming from someone still in school, a lot of it has been heard from me, yet thankfully not endured. It was penned by Harmony Korine, who also made a film I vow to never see. If the film proves anything, it proves that kids need to be taught to formulate an understanding of vital things such as art, philosophy, politics, and film itself. They need to be shown such mediums in order for sustainable growth to occur. My grandmother brought up a point about the vastly growing unemployment rate in America recently, and I think it's one that fits perfectly with this film; "how do you expect to have a thriving country when you have louses inhabiting it?" Starring: Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce, Chlo&euml; Sevigny, and Rosario Dawson. Directed by: Larry Clark.

    I was fourteen when this movie came out and spent pretty much all my free time skateboarding, so when i first caught the preview it intrigued me based on the skating alone. I knew who Harold Hunter was and thought it was going to be a movie about skating, only hitch is that it's NC-17. When this came out i wanted to see it so badly i didn't care what lengths that meant going to. So i asked my mom if she would take me! What a colossal mistake, i couldn't think of a more uncomfortable movie to see with a parent or authority figure. The first ten minute make-out to sex scene was gutt wrenching. My mom wanted to leave right away, she leaned over and said "let's go" but i was unable to move, this was around the time in my life when i was so defiant i would sit in a crowded movie theater with my mom while basically a cheap porno was playing, and still refuse to leave. So the entire movie revolves around one kid with AIDS who has a fetish for young virgins, and his miscellaneous crew including a young Rosario Dawson as they navigate mid-nineties New York. Partying, pool hopping, robbery, rape, drugs, beat-downs, it's just another day in the big apple! The movie plays out in almost documentary fashion while the audience is subjected to the unfortunate saga of a young man with a raging disease who basically rapes one girl after another. It's magnified reality to my poor mother who i dragged to the movie then refused to leave. It was way to much, she accosted me in the parking lot "why did you take me to that movie" i told her "i thought it was about skateboarding!?" she replies "the only skateboarding i saw was when they beat that man to death!". Shocked, i didn't see another movie with my mom until Spiderman 3 which was another exercise in horrible movie making. Only on a different level of course.

    So many scenes in Larry Clark's Kids are immoral and reprehensible that naming them all would eventually birth a list. The film, itself, is a remarkable piece, but the dialog in it is harsh, degrading, yet such a common standard today that it sadly seems like the norm. Filmed and released in 1995, it was certainly ahead of its time, and it's safe to say that things haven't gotten any better for society. Consistent readers will know that I love films with sharp, inviting social commentary on our world. I recently awarded three and a half stars to Bobcat Goldthwait's remarkably sharp film God Bless America, about a man and a young girl taking a loaded gun to things they have a disdain for in the world, such as empty-headed celebrities and hate-spreading political commentators. I awarded the same amount of stars to Falling Down, with Michael Douglas, another brilliantly crafted exercise providing a stern lecture on the arrogance of our world. And now, here is Kids, which comes straight out of left field for me. It is a poignantly made picture chronicling the lives of societal degenerates as they hopelessly wander the streets of New York City, unaccompanied and unprotected from the grittiness that lies ahead. Our "protagonist" is sixteen year old Telly (Fitzpatrick). The film opens with him kissing a twelve year old girl, and it eventually leads to sex after Telly forces the reluctant youth. He gives her the "I care about you" spiel, as he desperately wants to be the one to take her virginity. The inevitable happens, and afterwards, he meets his pal Casper (Justin Pierce) outside where he heartlessly discusses, in explicit detail, sex with the youth. Words fly to the viewer like bullets in a shootout, and we see the two casually walk up the city block, where they talk loud, shout obscenities, maybe shoplift a bottle of malt liquor, etc. Casper tells Telly that if he were to die tomorrow, he'd be remembered by the girls whose virginity he took for fifty plus years. Kids follows their footsteps in a "day in the life" kind of fashion. The two go to a drug-dealer's house, have a few hits off a joint, go to a party, get drunk, force each other to answer uncomfortable questions, etc, all in a parent-less, soulless environment. The subplot involves a group of girls, where the film decides to focus on two of them. One of them is HIV negative Ruby (Rosario Dawson in a stunningly offbeat role), who has had sex eight times. The other is HIV positive Jenny (Chlo&euml; Sevigny); she had sex once, with Telly. Jenny is sickened with anger and sadness, and drearily plods her way through the day at nightclubs and contemplates what will come of her future with this mishap. The film paints a tragic portrait of American youth. What's worse is the ignorance from parents. Telly stops quickly at his decrepit apartment to steal cash from his mother, kick his cat, and continue to take advantage of his life in a relentless fashion. What spawned such shocking behavior? Most likely years of careless parenting and neglect. His parents, we only see his mother, are hopelessly ignorant towards the fact their son is the degenerate from hell, having sex with young girls for temporary gratification. They ask no questions, possibly because they fear such answers. A shallow, yet common, example of parenting. What a remarkably sad picture this is. What an extremely well written one it is as well. Coming from someone still in school, a lot of it has been heard from me, yet thankfully not endured. It was penned by Harmony Korine, who also made a film I vow to never see. If the film proves anything, it proves that kids need to be taught to formulate an understanding of vital things such as art, philosophy, politics, and film itself. They need to be shown such mediums in order for sustainable growth to occur. My grandmother brought up a point about the vastly growing unemployment rate in America recently, and I think it's one that fits perfectly with this film; "how do you expect to have a thriving country when you have louses inhabiting it?" Starring: Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce, Chlo&euml; Sevigny, and Rosario Dawson. Directed by: Larry Clark.

    Looking to be depressed for an hour and a half? I have a perfect solution. Watch Kids and you will seek out the nearest bridge and take a flying leap into the abyss. It begins with a 17 year old boy named Telly making out with a 12 year old girl, trying to convince her that it is time to lose her virginity. He is successful in his mission and tells his friend Casper about the deflowering. They then shoplift booze from a local store, go home, smoke some pot, and inhale nitrous oxide from balloons. They meet more young girls and engage in graphic sexual conversations. One of the promiscuous lolitas has tested positive for HIV aids but continues to have unprotected sexual relations. The kids are young and think that they will live forever. No one seems to have any parental supervision at any point in this grim outlook on today's inner city youth.

    This movie accurately portrayed a lifestyle back then. I was a senior in high school when this came out and although we lived in New Haven and not New York, the group of people I knew, dressed like them, talked like them, boarded and were ravers. To me when I watch this movie, it's like watching my life when I was 17, without the HIV part of course. I love this movie and I think it's one of the most accurate, best ever made on the subject of youth. This and Thirteen as well. Both are very realistic. We don't like to admit that kids are doing these things like drugs, being promiscuous and skipping school to get high. But it's how it is happening in many cities not just New York. This movie is not promoting this lifestyle, it's simply giving an accurate portrayal into the lives of a group of skaters/ravers, and how life was for them back in the 90's.

    This is not a super super film, but it stays with you, which was sort of the point - especially if you saw it at the time it was released, before the onslaught of "dark" teen movies over the decade following. This was the granddaddy of the genre and remains one of the darkest and grittiest of them all, in both subject and style. Perhaps in part because the subjects were an urban group of kids, rather than the angsty suburban set we've grown accustomed to seeing, there is a rare and truthful ferocity to the characterizations. The emotive mechanism isn't their redemption as mere children, but their total fallibility as young adults. Though obviously this represents a small sample of teenagers in the united states, it will make you think twice about how much earlier we seem to lose our childhood these days. Great ensemble cast with very believable performances. Its attempt to approximate the reality of a documentary is a unique success. In addition to stong dialogue and direction, credit should be given to the cast for that; obviously, chloe sevigny was a standout here. A really important subject for its time and a very credible portrayal.

    this is my first "review" on IMDb and i would like to underline that it's a result of unjustified negativity towards this movie. the movie "kids" is kind of a testament to a certain generation. just like the movie "taxi driver" is to another generation, or merely a different span in time. i cannot comprehend why anyone would rate this movie negative in any way shape or form. it tries to deliver a message and it actually succeeds doing so in the most authentic way i can imagine. even more so than "taxi driver" which used a lot more theatrical elements to create more of a movie experience rather than "kids" which i personally think is almost like a documentary. aside from this, i think i just fit the generation that is portrait in this movie and i know how accurate and authentic it is. don't misinterpret me though. i don't have aids, i didn't f... any virgin and i never beat anybody up. but i feel like i am part of this generation and this is why i feel this movie did a awesome job capturing this generation, this momentum.

    You can look at the film Kids in a lot of different ways. Maybe it's a film for teenagers. Maybe it's a film for adults. Maybe both. A film that came out in 1995 and never really never got a chance. A difficult film with an uncomfortable subject but that is why it works. Directed by controversial director Larry Clark, Kids from 1995 was originally given an NC-17 rating but was then released unrated. The plot tells the controversial story of a group of poor teens who's life consists of mostly drugs, alcohol, sex and AIDS. The movie has a thin plot and even thinner character development. Even with these flaws, Clark is trying to depict a teen world that we don't usually see where these kids get away with a lot. I could relate a bit being with familiar with classmates who have similar problems. Some scenes are quite realistic and very hard to watch but many of the actions have very real consequences. This is a film that could only be made by a director with an attitude and a lot of confidence and Clark has that. I found the New York City setting to be very real and effective. This is a setting we've seen quite a bit but here New York City is not glamorous but is gritty, run down with a dangerous feel to it. Not the New York City we usually see in movies. The setting is very effective and helps makes the story. Kids is an interesting movie that depicts the dangers of our world and is a wake-up call to parents. It is probably one of the most controversial films of it's time and for an audience of the right age, it is a must-see.

    I am a big fan of harmony korine's films. i find that he pushes the boundaries of ordinary cinema but still manages to appeal to a wide audience. i have often found that with his films, you either love them, or you hate them. It was recommended to me by a friend who claimed there to be a twist at the end of the film, obviously this got me hyped up and was probably what drove me to watch it, but it turned out it wasn't everything my friend had made it out to be. This was probably what left me disappointed with the film. overall I still enjoyed it. I found that it picked up on some very realistic issues and was definitely a well thought out film. For what it was i think it was definitely pushed to the maximum potential it could of achieved. I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy indie films or if you're just looking for something a bit different from what you usually watch.

    In cinema verite style "Kids" invites us into the lives of sex-driven teenagers crazed on scoring, addicted to cussing and verging on self-destructive practises. Bound to big controversy when first released due to its explicit nature, which involves sexual promiscuity, including date rape, and drinking / drug binges of minors, some barely out of puberty, the movie still packs a punch out of the blue, suggesting how break-through the movie still is. Verging on a exploitational, not withstanding the young age of the scriptwriter, through its naturalistic quasi-documentary storytelling "Kids" attempts to convey a sense of teenage frustration and reality as verging on nihilistic and devoid of wider purpose. Through the extrapolated portrayals many viewed the movie as a wake-up call for American parents, whereas it seems more like preaching to the choir, the repetitive belief, that this generation is more depraved then 'back in the days'. The amoral behaviour of kid characters is suggested to be representative of the wider population, but essentially shows a certain fragment of it, maybe not marginal, but certainly dysfunctional and a minority. Sacrificing reality with shock factor and sensatonalism, dimishes the overall worth, also misleading the audience as to the real state of the youth, subverting certain reviewers to gasp in baseless shock as to modern-day teenagers. Backed with then unknown actors Larry Clark however manages to introduce a sense of dramatic realism, which despite not playing as a moral compass, points out to issues rarely portrayed / touched in contemporary cinema, but one so basic as the hormonal storms of adolescence, coupled with the relatively recent change in perceptions of adulthood. Since the XIX century concepts of age of sexual initiation dramatically changed increasing the age of consensual intercourse, naturally without altering natural sexual tendencies at age 14-17. After a period of hypocritical chastity enforced by parents on youth, for years now we have entered a phase of individualistic self-realisation among kids, but devoid of the moral compass of parents often too detached to understand the necessities of constructive parenthood. Despite its many flaws "Kids" still remains poignant, despite no soliloquy on morality to point a direction, just as a warning sign to parents as to societal risks in peer groups and the tough educational input needed to help guide through this emotionally rampant phase of growing up.

    I saw this movie many years ago, I was probably 18 at the time and I never forgot Talie's face, the disgusting kid, nor the last scene. a couple of days ago, I was at a friends house and she had this DVD and I was like 'hum, I know this guy, but where do I know him from?'. I honestly thought I'd met him in real life, thats how this stuck to my memory. I never socialised with kids like these, but they exist all around us. I remember a girl in my school who was 13 and having sex with lots of people and drove one of my neighbours to suicide cause she dumped him for another kid. He was 14. she and a friend were later expelled from school for urinating in the class. One of my cousins used to hang out with skateboarders and one of his friends died of overdose age 21. they pretty much looked like the group in this movie language and clothes wise. I also met a guy in my hall in Uni who was basically getting laid with every girl he could get his hands on, really disgusting. But what is really shocking about this movie is the reality of aids. and the darkness of the last scene where immorality and irresponsibility turn into creepy stuff like disease, crime and homelessness. It will stay with you for life.
