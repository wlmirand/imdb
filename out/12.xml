 <sinopse>
  A boat has been destroyed, criminals are dead, and the key to this mystery lies with the only survivor and his twisted, convoluted story beginning with five career crooks in a seemingly random police lineup.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Following a truck hijack in New York, five conmen are arrested and brought together for questioning. As none of them is guilty, they plan a revenge operation against the police. The operation goes well, but then the influence of a legendary mastermind criminal called Keyser S&ouml;ze is felt. It becomes clear that each one of them has wronged S&ouml;ze at some point and must pay back now. The payback job leaves 27 men dead in a boat explosion, but the real question arises now: Who actually is Keyser S&ouml;ze?

    Bryan Singer directed this twist-laden story about Verbal Kint, a suspect(Kevin Spacy, excellent) found at a massive boat explosion being interrogated by a detective(Chazz Palminteri) about his involvement. He claims to be innocent, and the real mastermind named Keyser Soze was behind it, a man he is deathly afraid of. He then tells the story of how this began, when he was in the police lockup with other con men(played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollock, Stephen Baldwin, and Benicio Del Toro) who become involved in a revenge scheme that goes wrong... Quite original and unpredictable film is well acted and written, leading to a supremely well crafted finale...only negative is that, when all is said and done, you're not quite sure what to believe, and there is hardly anyone to care about. Still, an engrossing film noir experience.

    Afte the fairly unknown "Public Access", this film was the second project by director Bryan Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie. And man, did it deliver. It won both Oscars (including one for McQuarrie) it was nominated for and, as of this day, stands on #26 of IMDb's highest rated films of all time. There's a good chance that, after you've watched The Usual Suspects, you may feel the urge to see it again not much after to focus on details you did not concentrate on during the first viewing. This is easily one of the best examples ever of how an unexpected ending can raise the quality of a film in the viewer's mind and even carry the one who came up with it to Oscar glory. Of course, that is not to say that everything that happened in the roughly 90 minutes before the final twist is rather forgettable. It certainly is not. It's a nice buildup. As for me, I was not too impressed with the whole story. What I did like, however, were the performances. Awards-wise, Spacey was the only standout, but almost the complete cast portrayed their characters convincingly. Spacey shines as the weak cripple whose skills in coordination and planning make him a valuable addition to the team. Pete Postlethwaite is second to none in the very few scenes he has and a truly magnetic presence. The look he gives Byrne's character out of the conference room is one of the highlights, just like the whole elevator-/kidnapping-scene before. And last but not least, said Gabriel Byrne delivers a great performance as an ex-cop, ex-criminal stuck between both worlds now. The way he portrays his inner conflict and his interactions with Spacey's character elevate the material a lot. When it came to the mysterious Keyser S&ouml;ze, I'm not sure how many of his scenes were really so memorable because of the quality or just because of the crassness. I'm mostly referring to the flashback including his family here. Nonetheless, the character is known stands for an invisible evil force in pop culture talk to this day, soon 20 years later, and that's surely an impressive achievement. I recommend this film, if there's even anybody out there who still hasn't seen it. I don't think it's as good as its rating and on this website suggests, but it's still a fairly entertaining 100 minutes, especially if cop/crime-stories are among your genre preferences.

    A really great crime mystery from the 1990's. That has you guessing who the protagonist is the hole way through. Starring: Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, & Giancarlo Esposito The story centers around 5 crooks. Who owe a debt to a mysterious foreign mobster. Who has these criminals doing work for him to repay that debt. From the cop's to the criminal's casting was perfect. & the whole pacing of the story being told through interrogation/flashbacks was well crafted. Definitely a must see for anyone into crime/mystery/heist movies

    It is hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old. I first saw in in 1999, and several times since then. I have found my overall impressions changing over time. Is it a great movie? That depends entirely on your own preferences in movies. But it certainly has an interesting script and Kevin Spacey is superb as the cripple "Verbal Kint". What we have here is a story told from the point of view of an unreliable narrator. Not that Kint himself is unreliable, but as one of the five "usual suspects", perhaps the only survivor, he tells Agent Dave Kujan ('ku-yawn') a story that he believes will satisfy him and allow Kint to go free. Not that he is overly worried because he has immunity, which also confuses Kujan. So if you look at the story in real time, most of it takes place in a police station office where Kujan is asking Kint questions. Most of what we see as other action is a depiction of the story Kint is telling Kujan. But Kint talks about certain things (barbershop quartet in Skokie) and people (Kobayashi) that near the end we learn are things he noticed in the office. So it is reasonable to assume much, perhaps almost all, of the story Kint is telling, and we are seeing, is fabricated. Such that, when the movie ends our natural question is "How much of this was really true?" That might upset some viewers, but it really speaks to the core of the story. It isn't about what might really have happened at the wharf that fateful night, it is about Verbal Kint and his ability to manipulate the situation in the police station office. Plus whatever he might be in his real life. But he does tell an interesting story, doesn't he? The cast is excellent, Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus, Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, a mumbling Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster, Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney and of course Kevin Spacey as Roger 'Verbal' Kint. Also Chazz Palminteri is excellent as Dave Kujan, US Customs. An interesting role is played by Pete Postlethwaite. In the story told by Kint we see him playing Kobayashi. So that might lead one to believe that character was real, not fictional. I look at it differently, Kint has to describe the characters, his description (to Kujan) is what we see as Postlethwaite, who we later find out is in fact tied in with Kint, so it would be dangerous if he really is Kobayashi. Good movie, see it twice, then see it once again. And figure it all out in a way that makes sense to YOU. MAJOR SPOILER: As the interview ends, and Kint reclaims his items, notably "gold" watch and "gold" lighter, signs of wealth, and leaves, a fax of an image of Keyser S&ouml;ze is being received at the police station. We see the sketch looks like Verbal Kint, Kujan realizes who he has been interviewing. At the same time we see Kint gradually losing his limp, he had been faking being cripple, he gets into a black car driven by Postlethwaite, the myth and mystery of Keyser S&ouml;ze continues.

    First of all I have to tell about this movie that when it finished I was speechless. The main feature of this movie is its plot. Plot plays the main role in this movie and makes it just perfect. Kevin Spacey makes an outstanding interpretation as Roger 'Verbal' Kint and that was the reason of winning the Oscar for the Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton and Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster made an also great interpretations. "The Usual Suspects" is a movie which is a landmark for me because it was a really interesting movie from the start of it until the end of it. From the start of the movie you wonder who is this guy named Keyser S&ouml;ze? Who is he finally? If you want the answer to this question you have to see the movie...

    The Usual Suspects is a brilliant movie with a really clever,different and extremely well developed storyline,with a really talented cast that all portrayed their characters perfectly.The best performance goes of course to Kevin Spacey,he delivered such a fantastic performance as Verbal,the character was both very likable and unlikeable in a very weird way,and the twist at the end which I will not spoil it extremely unexpected,you will not see it coming,he definitely deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (although I do not see how his character was a 'supporting role',he had more lines than anyone else for sure).The Usual Suspects is both a well written and well acted film that will easily withstand the test of time,I would highly recommend it to all fans of both crime movies and thrillers. After a boat has been destroyed and killing many men,Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey) tells the tale from his point of view how the incident came together.

Kevin Spacey's outstanding acting throughout was also another positive. Believe me, no one saw it coming.The ending.I would recommend it to everyone. Kevin Spacey. What an actor. The way he performed and handled his role was amazing. This was the movie which made him a star and still to this day remains his greatest work. Gabriel Bryne was also superb throughout. This movie was a complicated piece of work but it is without a doubt worth a watch at least once. One of the most memorable movies, I have seen in recent times

    The Usual Suspects seemed like a relatively simple thriller in the beginning but just by a single masterstroke in the end, it was shot into the league of the greatest suspense films, for it changed the entire perspective of the viewer and threw away every bits & pieces of information he/she had acquired over the runtime, and that's where this film's biggest strength lies. Direction by Bryan Singer is first-class as he really let the tension build up superbly & added layers after layers of twists & turns, succeeding in confusing its viewers and finally, in the end, played a masterstroke that changed everything. Performances are really good with everyone chipping in with their vital contributions but but the one remarkable performance that stood out belongs to none other than Kevin Spacey. On an overall scale, The Usual Suspects is tense, tightly structured, captivating, twisting & confusing and once you've recovered from the final shock, everything about this film will start making sense. After all, the greatest trick director Bryan Singer pulled out in this film was to convince the viewers that The Usual Suspects is just another thriller.

    Yes I said it and can careless if you disagree. It's called an opinion and reflects my beliefs and not yours. The film has a bunch of interesting characters who do a good job in filling the role they were assigned to but still not enough to call the film a masterpiece. Or maybe it was the "twist" ending that made the masses officially fall in love with the film. Reading various reviews from different websites only further confirmed why people loved the film. The film involves a man named Verbal Kint telling a story to an interrogator about events that led him and four other men to a Los Angeles port where a massive fire and deaths had taken place. As well as the mysterious man Keyser Soza who is the man who commissioned their work. Maybe the ending did not catch me off guard or changed the way I felt about the movie which is why I can't call it a masterpiece or the greatest movie ever made. The film is a 7/10

    I have seen thrillers. Nothing comes close to this one. All I can tell you about this movie is that, Kevin Spacey is amazing. The photography, the music, the dialog, the narration, the plot, the conclusion - in fact everything about the Usual Suspects is amazing. And like the director intimated, you have to watch it twice for everything to come together. The opening scene was quite slow and boring. The build up was even more confusing. The characters developed slowly yet strongly. The constant flashbacks helped a lot. I would recommend this movie to you. It is the best (or one of the best I have ever seen).

The characters developed slowly yet strongly. The constant flashbacks helped a lot. I would recommend this movie to you. It is the best (or one of the best I have ever seen).

    Bryan Singer directed this twist-laden story about Verbal Kint, a suspect(Kevin Spacy, excellent) found at a massive boat explosion being interrogated by a detective(Chazz Palminteri) about his involvement. He claims to be innocent, and the real mastermind named Keyser Soze was behind it, a man he is deathly afraid of. He then tells the story of how this began, when he was in the police lockup with other con men(played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollock, Stephen Baldwin, and Benicio Del Toro) who become involved in a revenge scheme that goes wrong... Quite original and unpredictable film is well acted and written, leading to a supremely well crafted finale...only negative is that, when all is said and done, you're not quite sure what to believe, and there is hardly anyone to care about. Still, an engrossing film noir experience.

    Afte the fairly unknown "Public Access", this film was the second project by director Bryan Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie. And man, did it deliver. It won both Oscars (including one for McQuarrie) it was nominated for and, as of this day, stands on #26 of IMDb's highest rated films of all time. There's a good chance that, after you've watched The Usual Suspects, you may feel the urge to see it again not much after to focus on details you did not concentrate on during the first viewing. This is easily one of the best examples ever of how an unexpected ending can raise the quality of a film in the viewer's mind and even carry the one who came up with it to Oscar glory. Of course, that is not to say that everything that happened in the roughly 90 minutes before the final twist is rather forgettable. It certainly is not. It's a nice buildup. As for me, I was not too impressed with the whole story. What I did like, however, were the performances. Awards-wise, Spacey was the only standout, but almost the complete cast portrayed their characters convincingly. Spacey shines as the weak cripple whose skills in coordination and planning make him a valuable addition to the team. Pete Postlethwaite is second to none in the very few scenes he has and a truly magnetic presence. The look he gives Byrne's character out of the conference room is one of the highlights, just like the whole elevator-/kidnapping-scene before. And last but not least, said Gabriel Byrne delivers a great performance as an ex-cop, ex-criminal stuck between both worlds now. The way he portrays his inner conflict and his interactions with Spacey's character elevate the material a lot. When it came to the mysterious Keyser S&ouml;ze, I'm not sure how many of his scenes were really so memorable because of the quality or just because of the crassness. I'm mostly referring to the flashback including his family here. Nonetheless, the character is known stands for an invisible evil force in pop culture talk to this day, soon 20 years later, and that's surely an impressive achievement. I recommend this film, if there's even anybody out there who still hasn't seen it. I don't think it's as good as its rating and on this website suggests, but it's still a fairly entertaining 100 minutes, especially if cop/crime-stories are among your genre preferences.

    A really great crime mystery from the 1990's. That has you guessing who the protagonist is the hole way through. Starring: Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, & Giancarlo Esposito The story centers around 5 crooks. Who owe a debt to a mysterious foreign mobster. Who has these criminals doing work for him to repay that debt. From the cop's to the criminal's casting was perfect. & the whole pacing of the story being told through interrogation/flashbacks was well crafted. Definitely a must see for anyone into crime/mystery/heist movies

    It is hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old. I first saw in in 1999, and several times since then. I have found my overall impressions changing over time. Is it a great movie? That depends entirely on your own preferences in movies. But it certainly has an interesting script and Kevin Spacey is superb as the cripple "Verbal Kint". What we have here is a story told from the point of view of an unreliable narrator. Not that Kint himself is unreliable, but as one of the five "usual suspects", perhaps the only survivor, he tells Agent Dave Kujan ('ku-yawn') a story that he believes will satisfy him and allow Kint to go free. Not that he is overly worried because he has immunity, which also confuses Kujan. So if you look at the story in real time, most of it takes place in a police station office where Kujan is asking Kint questions. Most of what we see as other action is a depiction of the story Kint is telling Kujan. But Kint talks about certain things (barbershop quartet in Skokie) and people (Kobayashi) that near the end we learn are things he noticed in the office. So it is reasonable to assume much, perhaps almost all, of the story Kint is telling, and we are seeing, is fabricated. Such that, when the movie ends our natural question is "How much of this was really true?" That might upset some viewers, but it really speaks to the core of the story. It isn't about what might really have happened at the wharf that fateful night, it is about Verbal Kint and his ability to manipulate the situation in the police station office. Plus whatever he might be in his real life. But he does tell an interesting story, doesn't he? The cast is excellent, Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus, Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, a mumbling Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster, Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney and of course Kevin Spacey as Roger 'Verbal' Kint. Also Chazz Palminteri is excellent as Dave Kujan, US Customs. An interesting role is played by Pete Postlethwaite. In the story told by Kint we see him playing Kobayashi. So that might lead one to believe that character was real, not fictional. I look at it differently, Kint has to describe the characters, his description (to Kujan) is what we see as Postlethwaite, who we later find out is in fact tied in with Kint, so it would be dangerous if he really is Kobayashi. Good movie, see it twice, then see it once again. And figure it all out in a way that makes sense to YOU. MAJOR SPOILER: As the interview ends, and Kint reclaims his items, notably "gold" watch and "gold" lighter, signs of wealth, and leaves, a fax of an image of Keyser S&ouml;ze is being received at the police station. We see the sketch looks like Verbal Kint, Kujan realizes who he has been interviewing. At the same time we see Kint gradually losing his limp, he had been faking being cripple, he gets into a black car driven by Postlethwaite, the myth and mystery of Keyser S&ouml;ze continues.

    First of all I have to tell about this movie that when it finished I was speechless. The main feature of this movie is its plot. Plot plays the main role in this movie and makes it just perfect. Kevin Spacey makes an outstanding interpretation as Roger 'Verbal' Kint and that was the reason of winning the Oscar for the Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton and Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster made an also great interpretations. "The Usual Suspects" is a movie which is a landmark for me because it was a really interesting movie from the start of it until the end of it. From the start of the movie you wonder who is this guy named Keyser S&ouml;ze? Who is he finally? If you want the answer to this question you have to see the movie...

    The Usual Suspects is a brilliant movie with a really clever,different and extremely well developed storyline,with a really talented cast that all portrayed their characters perfectly.The best performance goes of course to Kevin Spacey,he delivered such a fantastic performance as Verbal,the character was both very likable and unlikeable in a very weird way,and the twist at the end which I will not spoil it extremely unexpected,you will not see it coming,he definitely deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (although I do not see how his character was a 'supporting role',he had more lines than anyone else for sure).The Usual Suspects is both a well written and well acted film that will easily withstand the test of time,I would highly recommend it to all fans of both crime movies and thrillers. After a boat has been destroyed and killing many men,Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey) tells the tale from his point of view how the incident came together.

Kevin Spacey's outstanding acting throughout was also another positive. Believe me, no one saw it coming.The ending.I would recommend it to everyone. Kevin Spacey. What an actor. The way he performed and handled his role was amazing. This was the movie which made him a star and still to this day remains his greatest work. Gabriel Bryne was also superb throughout. This movie was a complicated piece of work but it is without a doubt worth a watch at least once. One of the most memorable movies, I have seen in recent times

    The Usual Suspects seemed like a relatively simple thriller in the beginning but just by a single masterstroke in the end, it was shot into the league of the greatest suspense films, for it changed the entire perspective of the viewer and threw away every bits & pieces of information he/she had acquired over the runtime, and that's where this film's biggest strength lies. Direction by Bryan Singer is first-class as he really let the tension build up superbly & added layers after layers of twists & turns, succeeding in confusing its viewers and finally, in the end, played a masterstroke that changed everything. Performances are really good with everyone chipping in with their vital contributions but but the one remarkable performance that stood out belongs to none other than Kevin Spacey. On an overall scale, The Usual Suspects is tense, tightly structured, captivating, twisting & confusing and once you've recovered from the final shock, everything about this film will start making sense. After all, the greatest trick director Bryan Singer pulled out in this film was to convince the viewers that The Usual Suspects is just another thriller.

    Yes I said it and can careless if you disagree. It's called an opinion and reflects my beliefs and not yours. The film has a bunch of interesting characters who do a good job in filling the role they were assigned to but still not enough to call the film a masterpiece. Or maybe it was the "twist" ending that made the masses officially fall in love with the film. Reading various reviews from different websites only further confirmed why people loved the film. The film involves a man named Verbal Kint telling a story to an interrogator about events that led him and four other men to a Los Angeles port where a massive fire and deaths had taken place. As well as the mysterious man Keyser Soza who is the man who commissioned their work. Maybe the ending did not catch me off guard or changed the way I felt about the movie which is why I can't call it a masterpiece or the greatest movie ever made. The film is a 7/10

    Afte the fairly unknown "Public Access", this film was the second project by director Bryan Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie. And man, did it deliver. It won both Oscars (including one for McQuarrie) it was nominated for and, as of this day, stands on #26 of IMDb's highest rated films of all time. There's a good chance that, after you've watched The Usual Suspects, you may feel the urge to see it again not much after to focus on details you did not concentrate on during the first viewing. This is easily one of the best examples ever of how an unexpected ending can raise the quality of a film in the viewer's mind and even carry the one who came up with it to Oscar glory. Of course, that is not to say that everything that happened in the roughly 90 minutes before the final twist is rather forgettable. It certainly is not. It's a nice buildup. As for me, I was not too impressed with the whole story. What I did like, however, were the performances. Awards-wise, Spacey was the only standout, but almost the complete cast portrayed their characters convincingly. Spacey shines as the weak cripple whose skills in coordination and planning make him a valuable addition to the team. Pete Postlethwaite is second to none in the very few scenes he has and a truly magnetic presence. The look he gives Byrne's character out of the conference room is one of the highlights, just like the whole elevator-/kidnapping-scene before. And last but not least, said Gabriel Byrne delivers a great performance as an ex-cop, ex-criminal stuck between both worlds now. The way he portrays his inner conflict and his interactions with Spacey's character elevate the material a lot. When it came to the mysterious Keyser S&ouml;ze, I'm not sure how many of his scenes were really so memorable because of the quality or just because of the crassness. I'm mostly referring to the flashback including his family here. Nonetheless, the character is known stands for an invisible evil force in pop culture talk to this day, soon 20 years later, and that's surely an impressive achievement. I recommend this film, if there's even anybody out there who still hasn't seen it. I don't think it's as good as its rating and on this website suggests, but it's still a fairly entertaining 100 minutes, especially if cop/crime-stories are among your genre preferences.

    A really great crime mystery from the 1990's. That has you guessing who the protagonist is the hole way through. Starring: Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, & Giancarlo Esposito The story centers around 5 crooks. Who owe a debt to a mysterious foreign mobster. Who has these criminals doing work for him to repay that debt. From the cop's to the criminal's casting was perfect. & the whole pacing of the story being told through interrogation/flashbacks was well crafted. Definitely a must see for anyone into crime/mystery/heist movies

    It is hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old. I first saw in in 1999, and several times since then. I have found my overall impressions changing over time. Is it a great movie? That depends entirely on your own preferences in movies. But it certainly has an interesting script and Kevin Spacey is superb as the cripple "Verbal Kint". What we have here is a story told from the point of view of an unreliable narrator. Not that Kint himself is unreliable, but as one of the five "usual suspects", perhaps the only survivor, he tells Agent Dave Kujan ('ku-yawn') a story that he believes will satisfy him and allow Kint to go free. Not that he is overly worried because he has immunity, which also confuses Kujan. So if you look at the story in real time, most of it takes place in a police station office where Kujan is asking Kint questions. Most of what we see as other action is a depiction of the story Kint is telling Kujan. But Kint talks about certain things (barbershop quartet in Skokie) and people (Kobayashi) that near the end we learn are things he noticed in the office. So it is reasonable to assume much, perhaps almost all, of the story Kint is telling, and we are seeing, is fabricated. Such that, when the movie ends our natural question is "How much of this was really true?" That might upset some viewers, but it really speaks to the core of the story. It isn't about what might really have happened at the wharf that fateful night, it is about Verbal Kint and his ability to manipulate the situation in the police station office. Plus whatever he might be in his real life. But he does tell an interesting story, doesn't he? The cast is excellent, Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus, Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, a mumbling Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster, Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney and of course Kevin Spacey as Roger 'Verbal' Kint. Also Chazz Palminteri is excellent as Dave Kujan, US Customs. An interesting role is played by Pete Postlethwaite. In the story told by Kint we see him playing Kobayashi. So that might lead one to believe that character was real, not fictional. I look at it differently, Kint has to describe the characters, his description (to Kujan) is what we see as Postlethwaite, who we later find out is in fact tied in with Kint, so it would be dangerous if he really is Kobayashi. Good movie, see it twice, then see it once again. And figure it all out in a way that makes sense to YOU. MAJOR SPOILER: As the interview ends, and Kint reclaims his items, notably "gold" watch and "gold" lighter, signs of wealth, and leaves, a fax of an image of Keyser S&ouml;ze is being received at the police station. We see the sketch looks like Verbal Kint, Kujan realizes who he has been interviewing. At the same time we see Kint gradually losing his limp, he had been faking being cripple, he gets into a black car driven by Postlethwaite, the myth and mystery of Keyser S&ouml;ze continues.

    First of all I have to tell about this movie that when it finished I was speechless. The main feature of this movie is its plot. Plot plays the main role in this movie and makes it just perfect. Kevin Spacey makes an outstanding interpretation as Roger 'Verbal' Kint and that was the reason of winning the Oscar for the Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton and Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster made an also great interpretations. "The Usual Suspects" is a movie which is a landmark for me because it was a really interesting movie from the start of it until the end of it. From the start of the movie you wonder who is this guy named Keyser S&ouml;ze? Who is he finally? If you want the answer to this question you have to see the movie...

    The Usual Suspects is a brilliant movie with a really clever,different and extremely well developed storyline,with a really talented cast that all portrayed their characters perfectly.The best performance goes of course to Kevin Spacey,he delivered such a fantastic performance as Verbal,the character was both very likable and unlikeable in a very weird way,and the twist at the end which I will not spoil it extremely unexpected,you will not see it coming,he definitely deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (although I do not see how his character was a 'supporting role',he had more lines than anyone else for sure).The Usual Suspects is both a well written and well acted film that will easily withstand the test of time,I would highly recommend it to all fans of both crime movies and thrillers. After a boat has been destroyed and killing many men,Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey) tells the tale from his point of view how the incident came together.

    The movie started of pretty well. But got a bit boring towards the middle but the way they finished it off ,makes it one of the best movies I have ever seen. Kevin Spacey's outstanding acting throughout was also another positive. Believe me, no one saw it coming.The ending.I would recommend it to everyone. Kevin Spacey. What an actor. The way he performed and handled his role was amazing. This was the movie which made him a star and still to this day remains his greatest work. Gabriel Bryne was also superb throughout. This movie was a complicated piece of work but it is without a doubt worth a watch at least once. One of the most memorable movies, I have seen in recent times

    The Usual Suspects seemed like a relatively simple thriller in the beginning but just by a single masterstroke in the end, it was shot into the league of the greatest suspense films, for it changed the entire perspective of the viewer and threw away every bits & pieces of information he/she had acquired over the runtime, and that's where this film's biggest strength lies. Direction by Bryan Singer is first-class as he really let the tension build up superbly & added layers after layers of twists & turns, succeeding in confusing its viewers and finally, in the end, played a masterstroke that changed everything. Performances are really good with everyone chipping in with their vital contributions but but the one remarkable performance that stood out belongs to none other than Kevin Spacey. On an overall scale, The Usual Suspects is tense, tightly structured, captivating, twisting & confusing and once you've recovered from the final shock, everything about this film will start making sense. After all, the greatest trick director Bryan Singer pulled out in this film was to convince the viewers that The Usual Suspects is just another thriller.

    Yes I said it and can careless if you disagree. It's called an opinion and reflects my beliefs and not yours. The film has a bunch of interesting characters who do a good job in filling the role they were assigned to but still not enough to call the film a masterpiece. Or maybe it was the "twist" ending that made the masses officially fall in love with the film. Reading various reviews from different websites only further confirmed why people loved the film. The film involves a man named Verbal Kint telling a story to an interrogator about events that led him and four other men to a Los Angeles port where a massive fire and deaths had taken place. As well as the mysterious man Keyser Soza who is the man who commissioned their work. Maybe the ending did not catch me off guard or changed the way I felt about the movie which is why I can't call it a masterpiece or the greatest movie ever made. The film is a 7/10

    I have seen thrillers. Nothing comes close to this one. All I can tell you about this movie is that, Kevin Spacey is amazing. The photography, the music, the dialog, the narration, the plot, the conclusion - in fact everything about the Usual Suspects is amazing. And like the director intimated, you have to watch it twice for everything to come together. The opening scene was quite slow and boring. The build up was even more confusing. The characters developed slowly yet strongly. The constant flashbacks helped a lot. I would recommend this movie to you. It is the best (or one of the best I have ever seen).

    Bryan Singer directed this twist-laden story about Verbal Kint, a suspect(Kevin Spacy, excellent) found at a massive boat explosion being interrogated by a detective(Chazz Palminteri) about his involvement. He claims to be innocent, and the real mastermind named Keyser Soze was behind it, a man he is deathly afraid of. He then tells the story of how this began, when he was in the police lockup with other con men(played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollock, Stephen Baldwin, and Benicio Del Toro) who become involved in a revenge scheme that goes wrong... Quite original and unpredictable film is well acted and written, leading to a supremely well crafted finale...only negative is that, when all is said and done, you're not quite sure what to believe, and there is hardly anyone to care about. Still, an engrossing film noir experience.

I don't think it's as good as its rating and on this website suggests, but it's still a fairly entertaining 100 minutes, especially if cop/crime-stories are among your genre preferences.

    A really great crime mystery from the 1990's. That has you guessing who the protagonist is the hole way through. Starring: Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, & Giancarlo Esposito The story centers around 5 crooks. Who owe a debt to a mysterious foreign mobster. Who has these criminals doing work for him to repay that debt. From the cop's to the criminal's casting was perfect. & the whole pacing of the story being told through interrogation/flashbacks was well crafted. Definitely a must see for anyone into crime/mystery/heist movies

    It is hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old. I first saw in in 1999, and several times since then. I have found my overall impressions changing over time. Is it a great movie? That depends entirely on your own preferences in movies. But it certainly has an interesting script and Kevin Spacey is superb as the cripple "Verbal Kint". What we have here is a story told from the point of view of an unreliable narrator. Not that Kint himself is unreliable, but as one of the five "usual suspects", perhaps the only survivor, he tells Agent Dave Kujan ('ku-yawn') a story that he believes will satisfy him and allow Kint to go free. Not that he is overly worried because he has immunity, which also confuses Kujan. So if you look at the story in real time, most of it takes place in a police station office where Kujan is asking Kint questions. Most of what we see as other action is a depiction of the story Kint is telling Kujan. But Kint talks about certain things (barbershop quartet in Skokie) and people (Kobayashi) that near the end we learn are things he noticed in the office. So it is reasonable to assume much, perhaps almost all, of the story Kint is telling, and we are seeing, is fabricated. Such that, when the movie ends our natural question is "How much of this was really true?" That might upset some viewers, but it really speaks to the core of the story. It isn't about what might really have happened at the wharf that fateful night, it is about Verbal Kint and his ability to manipulate the situation in the police station office. Plus whatever he might be in his real life. But he does tell an interesting story, doesn't he? The cast is excellent, Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus, Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, a mumbling Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster, Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney and of course Kevin Spacey as Roger 'Verbal' Kint. Also Chazz Palminteri is excellent as Dave Kujan, US Customs. An interesting role is played by Pete Postlethwaite. In the story told by Kint we see him playing Kobayashi. So that might lead one to believe that character was real, not fictional. I look at it differently, Kint has to describe the characters, his description (to Kujan) is what we see as Postlethwaite, who we later find out is in fact tied in with Kint, so it would be dangerous if he really is Kobayashi. Good movie, see it twice, then see it once again. And figure it all out in a way that makes sense to YOU. MAJOR SPOILER: As the interview ends, and Kint reclaims his items, notably "gold" watch and "gold" lighter, signs of wealth, and leaves, a fax of an image of Keyser S&ouml;ze is being received at the police station. We see the sketch looks like Verbal Kint, Kujan realizes who he has been interviewing. At the same time we see Kint gradually losing his limp, he had been faking being cripple, he gets into a black car driven by Postlethwaite, the myth and mystery of Keyser S&ouml;ze continues.

    First of all I have to tell about this movie that when it finished I was speechless. The main feature of this movie is its plot. Plot plays the main role in this movie and makes it just perfect. Kevin Spacey makes an outstanding interpretation as Roger 'Verbal' Kint and that was the reason of winning the Oscar for the Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton and Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster made an also great interpretations. "The Usual Suspects" is a movie which is a landmark for me because it was a really interesting movie from the start of it until the end of it. From the start of the movie you wonder who is this guy named Keyser S&ouml;ze? Who is he finally? If you want the answer to this question you have to see the movie...

    The Usual Suspects is a brilliant movie with a really clever,different and extremely well developed storyline,with a really talented cast that all portrayed their characters perfectly.The best performance goes of course to Kevin Spacey,he delivered such a fantastic performance as Verbal,the character was both very likable and unlikeable in a very weird way,and the twist at the end which I will not spoil it extremely unexpected,you will not see it coming,he definitely deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (although I do not see how his character was a 'supporting role',he had more lines than anyone else for sure).The Usual Suspects is both a well written and well acted film that will easily withstand the test of time,I would highly recommend it to all fans of both crime movies and thrillers. After a boat has been destroyed and killing many men,Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey) tells the tale from his point of view how the incident came together.

    The movie started of pretty well. But got a bit boring towards the middle but the way they finished it off ,makes it one of the best movies I have ever seen. Kevin Spacey's outstanding acting throughout was also another positive. Believe me, no one saw it coming.The ending.I would recommend it to everyone. Kevin Spacey. What an actor. The way he performed and handled his role was amazing. This was the movie which made him a star and still to this day remains his greatest work. Gabriel Bryne was also superb throughout. This movie was a complicated piece of work but it is without a doubt worth a watch at least once. One of the most memorable movies, I have seen in recent times

    The Usual Suspects seemed like a relatively simple thriller in the beginning but just by a single masterstroke in the end, it was shot into the league of the greatest suspense films, for it changed the entire perspective of the viewer and threw away every bits & pieces of information he/she had acquired over the runtime, and that's where this film's biggest strength lies. Direction by Bryan Singer is first-class as he really let the tension build up superbly & added layers after layers of twists & turns, succeeding in confusing its viewers and finally, in the end, played a masterstroke that changed everything. Performances are really good with everyone chipping in with their vital contributions but but the one remarkable performance that stood out belongs to none other than Kevin Spacey. On an overall scale, The Usual Suspects is tense, tightly structured, captivating, twisting & confusing and once you've recovered from the final shock, everything about this film will start making sense. After all, the greatest trick director Bryan Singer pulled out in this film was to convince the viewers that The Usual Suspects is just another thriller.

    Yes I said it and can careless if you disagree. It's called an opinion and reflects my beliefs and not yours. The film has a bunch of interesting characters who do a good job in filling the role they were assigned to but still not enough to call the film a masterpiece. Or maybe it was the "twist" ending that made the masses officially fall in love with the film. Reading various reviews from different websites only further confirmed why people loved the film. The film involves a man named Verbal Kint telling a story to an interrogator about events that led him and four other men to a Los Angeles port where a massive fire and deaths had taken place. As well as the mysterious man Keyser Soza who is the man who commissioned their work. Maybe the ending did not catch me off guard or changed the way I felt about the movie which is why I can't call it a masterpiece or the greatest movie ever made. The film is a 7/10

    I have seen thrillers. Nothing comes close to this one. All I can tell you about this movie is that, Kevin Spacey is amazing. The photography, the music, the dialog, the narration, the plot, the conclusion - in fact everything about the Usual Suspects is amazing. And like the director intimated, you have to watch it twice for everything to come together. The opening scene was quite slow and boring. The build up was even more confusing. The characters developed slowly yet strongly. The constant flashbacks helped a lot. I would recommend this movie to you. It is the best (or one of the best I have ever seen).

    Bryan Singer directed this twist-laden story about Verbal Kint, a suspect(Kevin Spacy, excellent) found at a massive boat explosion being interrogated by a detective(Chazz Palminteri) about his involvement. He claims to be innocent, and the real mastermind named Keyser Soze was behind it, a man he is deathly afraid of. He then tells the story of how this began, when he was in the police lockup with other con men(played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollock, Stephen Baldwin, and Benicio Del Toro) who become involved in a revenge scheme that goes wrong... Quite original and unpredictable film is well acted and written, leading to a supremely well crafted finale...only negative is that, when all is said and done, you're not quite sure what to believe, and there is hardly anyone to care about. Still, an engrossing film noir experience.

    Afte the fairly unknown "Public Access", this film was the second project by director Bryan Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie. And man, did it deliver. It won both Oscars (including one for McQuarrie) it was nominated for and, as of this day, stands on #26 of IMDb's highest rated films of all time. There's a good chance that, after you've watched The Usual Suspects, you may feel the urge to see it again not much after to focus on details you did not concentrate on during the first viewing. This is easily one of the best examples ever of how an unexpected ending can raise the quality of a film in the viewer's mind and even carry the one who came up with it to Oscar glory. Of course, that is not to say that everything that happened in the roughly 90 minutes before the final twist is rather forgettable. It certainly is not. It's a nice buildup. As for me, I was not too impressed with the whole story. What I did like, however, were the performances. Awards-wise, Spacey was the only standout, but almost the complete cast portrayed their characters convincingly. Spacey shines as the weak cripple whose skills in coordination and planning make him a valuable addition to the team. Pete Postlethwaite is second to none in the very few scenes he has and a truly magnetic presence. The look he gives Byrne's character out of the conference room is one of the highlights, just like the whole elevator-/kidnapping-scene before. And last but not least, said Gabriel Byrne delivers a great performance as an ex-cop, ex-criminal stuck between both worlds now. The way he portrays his inner conflict and his interactions with Spacey's character elevate the material a lot. When it came to the mysterious Keyser S&ouml;ze, I'm not sure how many of his scenes were really so memorable because of the quality or just because of the crassness. I'm mostly referring to the flashback including his family here. Nonetheless, the character is known stands for an invisible evil force in pop culture talk to this day, soon 20 years later, and that's surely an impressive achievement. I recommend this film, if there's even anybody out there who still hasn't seen it. I don't think it's as good as its rating and on this website suggests, but it's still a fairly entertaining 100 minutes, especially if cop/crime-stories are among your genre preferences.

That depends entirely on your own preferences in movies. But it certainly has an interesting script and Kevin Spacey is superb as the cripple "Verbal Kint". What we have here is a story told from the point of view of an unreliable narrator. Not that Kint himself is unreliable, but as one of the five "usual suspects", perhaps the only survivor, he tells Agent Dave Kujan ('ku-yawn') a story that he believes will satisfy him and allow Kint to go free. Not that he is overly worried because he has immunity, which also confuses Kujan. So if you look at the story in real time, most of it takes place in a police station office where Kujan is asking Kint questions. Most of what we see as other action is a depiction of the story Kint is telling Kujan. But Kint talks about certain things (barbershop quartet in Skokie) and people (Kobayashi) that near the end we learn are things he noticed in the office. So it is reasonable to assume much, perhaps almost all, of the story Kint is telling, and we are seeing, is fabricated. Such that, when the movie ends our natural question is "How much of this was really true?" That might upset some viewers, but it really speaks to the core of the story. It isn't about what might really have happened at the wharf that fateful night, it is about Verbal Kint and his ability to manipulate the situation in the police station office. Plus whatever he might be in his real life. But he does tell an interesting story, doesn't he? The cast is excellent, Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus, Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, a mumbling Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster, Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney and of course Kevin Spacey as Roger 'Verbal' Kint. Also Chazz Palminteri is excellent as Dave Kujan, US Customs. An interesting role is played by Pete Postlethwaite. In the story told by Kint we see him playing Kobayashi. So that might lead one to believe that character was real, not fictional. I look at it differently, Kint has to describe the characters, his description (to Kujan) is what we see as Postlethwaite, who we later find out is in fact tied in with Kint, so it would be dangerous if he really is Kobayashi. Good movie, see it twice, then see it once again. And figure it all out in a way that makes sense to YOU. MAJOR SPOILER: As the interview ends, and Kint reclaims his items, notably "gold" watch and "gold" lighter, signs of wealth, and leaves, a fax of an image of Keyser S&ouml;ze is being received at the police station. We see the sketch looks like Verbal Kint, Kujan realizes who he has been interviewing. At the same time we see Kint gradually losing his limp, he had been faking being cripple, he gets into a black car driven by Postlethwaite, the myth and mystery of Keyser S&ouml;ze continues.

    First of all I have to tell about this movie that when it finished I was speechless. The main feature of this movie is its plot. Plot plays the main role in this movie and makes it just perfect. Kevin Spacey makes an outstanding interpretation as Roger 'Verbal' Kint and that was the reason of winning the Oscar for the Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton and Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster made an also great interpretations. "The Usual Suspects" is a movie which is a landmark for me because it was a really interesting movie from the start of it until the end of it. From the start of the movie you wonder who is this guy named Keyser S&ouml;ze? Who is he finally? If you want the answer to this question you have to see the movie...

    The Usual Suspects is a brilliant movie with a really clever,different and extremely well developed storyline,with a really talented cast that all portrayed their characters perfectly.The best performance goes of course to Kevin Spacey,he delivered such a fantastic performance as Verbal,the character was both very likable and unlikeable in a very weird way,and the twist at the end which I will not spoil it extremely unexpected,you will not see it coming,he definitely deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (although I do not see how his character was a 'supporting role',he had more lines than anyone else for sure).The Usual Suspects is both a well written and well acted film that will easily withstand the test of time,I would highly recommend it to all fans of both crime movies and thrillers. After a boat has been destroyed and killing many men,Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey) tells the tale from his point of view how the incident came together.

    The movie started of pretty well. But got a bit boring towards the middle but the way they finished it off ,makes it one of the best movies I have ever seen. Kevin Spacey's outstanding acting throughout was also another positive. Believe me, no one saw it coming.The ending.I would recommend it to everyone. Kevin Spacey. What an actor. The way he performed and handled his role was amazing. This was the movie which made him a star and still to this day remains his greatest work. Gabriel Bryne was also superb throughout. This movie was a complicated piece of work but it is without a doubt worth a watch at least once. One of the most memorable movies, I have seen in recent times

    The Usual Suspects seemed like a relatively simple thriller in the beginning but just by a single masterstroke in the end, it was shot into the league of the greatest suspense films, for it changed the entire perspective of the viewer and threw away every bits & pieces of information he/she had acquired over the runtime, and that's where this film's biggest strength lies. Direction by Bryan Singer is first-class as he really let the tension build up superbly & added layers after layers of twists & turns, succeeding in confusing its viewers and finally, in the end, played a masterstroke that changed everything. Performances are really good with everyone chipping in with their vital contributions but but the one remarkable performance that stood out belongs to none other than Kevin Spacey. On an overall scale, The Usual Suspects is tense, tightly structured, captivating, twisting & confusing and once you've recovered from the final shock, everything about this film will start making sense. After all, the greatest trick director Bryan Singer pulled out in this film was to convince the viewers that The Usual Suspects is just another thriller.

    Yes I said it and can careless if you disagree. It's called an opinion and reflects my beliefs and not yours. The film has a bunch of interesting characters who do a good job in filling the role they were assigned to but still not enough to call the film a masterpiece. Or maybe it was the "twist" ending that made the masses officially fall in love with the film. Reading various reviews from different websites only further confirmed why people loved the film. The film involves a man named Verbal Kint telling a story to an interrogator about events that led him and four other men to a Los Angeles port where a massive fire and deaths had taken place. As well as the mysterious man Keyser Soza who is the man who commissioned their work. Maybe the ending did not catch me off guard or changed the way I felt about the movie which is why I can't call it a masterpiece or the greatest movie ever made. The film is a 7/10

    I have seen thrillers. Nothing comes close to this one. All I can tell you about this movie is that, Kevin Spacey is amazing. The photography, the music, the dialog, the narration, the plot, the conclusion - in fact everything about the Usual Suspects is amazing. And like the director intimated, you have to watch it twice for everything to come together. The opening scene was quite slow and boring. The build up was even more confusing. The characters developed slowly yet strongly. The constant flashbacks helped a lot. I would recommend this movie to you. It is the best (or one of the best I have ever seen).

    Bryan Singer directed this twist-laden story about Verbal Kint, a suspect(Kevin Spacy, excellent) found at a massive boat explosion being interrogated by a detective(Chazz Palminteri) about his involvement. He claims to be innocent, and the real mastermind named Keyser Soze was behind it, a man he is deathly afraid of. He then tells the story of how this began, when he was in the police lockup with other con men(played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollock, Stephen Baldwin, and Benicio Del Toro) who become involved in a revenge scheme that goes wrong... Quite original and unpredictable film is well acted and written, leading to a supremely well crafted finale...only negative is that, when all is said and done, you're not quite sure what to believe, and there is hardly anyone to care about. Still, an engrossing film noir experience.

    Afte the fairly unknown "Public Access", this film was the second project by director Bryan Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie. And man, did it deliver. It won both Oscars (including one for McQuarrie) it was nominated for and, as of this day, stands on #26 of IMDb's highest rated films of all time. There's a good chance that, after you've watched The Usual Suspects, you may feel the urge to see it again not much after to focus on details you did not concentrate on during the first viewing. This is easily one of the best examples ever of how an unexpected ending can raise the quality of a film in the viewer's mind and even carry the one who came up with it to Oscar glory. Of course, that is not to say that everything that happened in the roughly 90 minutes before the final twist is rather forgettable. It certainly is not. It's a nice buildup. As for me, I was not too impressed with the whole story. What I did like, however, were the performances. Awards-wise, Spacey was the only standout, but almost the complete cast portrayed their characters convincingly. Spacey shines as the weak cripple whose skills in coordination and planning make him a valuable addition to the team. Pete Postlethwaite is second to none in the very few scenes he has and a truly magnetic presence. The look he gives Byrne's character out of the conference room is one of the highlights, just like the whole elevator-/kidnapping-scene before. And last but not least, said Gabriel Byrne delivers a great performance as an ex-cop, ex-criminal stuck between both worlds now. The way he portrays his inner conflict and his interactions with Spacey's character elevate the material a lot. When it came to the mysterious Keyser S&ouml;ze, I'm not sure how many of his scenes were really so memorable because of the quality or just because of the crassness. I'm mostly referring to the flashback including his family here. Nonetheless, the character is known stands for an invisible evil force in pop culture talk to this day, soon 20 years later, and that's surely an impressive achievement. I recommend this film, if there's even anybody out there who still hasn't seen it. I don't think it's as good as its rating and on this website suggests, but it's still a fairly entertaining 100 minutes, especially if cop/crime-stories are among your genre preferences.

    A really great crime mystery from the 1990's. That has you guessing who the protagonist is the hole way through. Starring: Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, & Giancarlo Esposito The story centers around 5 crooks. Who owe a debt to a mysterious foreign mobster. Who has these criminals doing work for him to repay that debt. From the cop's to the criminal's casting was perfect. & the whole pacing of the story being told through interrogation/flashbacks was well crafted. Definitely a must see for anyone into crime/mystery/heist movies
