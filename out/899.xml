    ***SPOILERS*** Artsy smartzy Igmar Bergman like British film that takes place in the dead of winter in a small Scottish town involving some half dozen persons who live there. There's mother and daughter Elspeth & Frances played by Phylida Law & Emma Thompson, who are mother and daughter in real life, who have trouble communicating with each other. Frances a professional photographer is sick and tired of living in the town since her husband suddenly passed away and is seriously thinking of resettling in far off and warm Australia. There's also Frances' teenage son Alex, Garry Hollywood, who's haunted by his father's ghost and is so into himself and his problems that he doesn't see tomboy Nita, Arlne Cockburn, is crazy about him and wants Alex to be her boyfriend every time he passes her riding his bike by the local bus stop. There's also spinsters Lily & Chloe, Sheila Reid & Sandra Voe, who find solace in their boring lives attending funerals for people that they don't know just to put some meaning and excitement into their lives. And finally there's Tom & Sam, Sean Bggerstaff & Dougas Murphy, who just happen to be playing hooky from school who, Tom that is, ends up meeting Elspeth by the shore and unconsciously brings both her and her estranged daughter Frances back together by having her photograph them. The two boys also find two kittens abandoned in a sea cave to their frozen fate and end up adopting them. Which in fact makes them skipping school worthwhile in saving the kittens lives. ***SPOILERS*** By the time the film is over you get the impression that everything was fine between all those involved in it with Elspeth & Frances together again and Alex & Nita now boyfriend and girlfriend. There's also Lily & Chole finally finding, after checking out all the newspapers obituaries, a funeral to attend and someone, the guest of honor, to morn for. The most confusing thing in the movie was what exactly happened to both Tom & Sam together with their kittens? They just seemed to have happily walked off the edge of the earth, into the frozen Arctic Sea, by the time the movie ended?

    The Winter Guest (1997) This has the depth and studious pace and multi-pronged construction of a good play. Which it once was. And like many plays turned to cinema, this carries along some first rate dramatic acting, namely by Emma Thompson and her real life mother, Phyllida Law, playing mother and daughter. As a small twist, the playwright, Sharman Macdonald, is mother to someone else we know, actress Keira Knightley. The scene is a forlorn village in the dead of winter on a Scottish coast. We are shown the first turn of innocent love, a pair of boys playing with the edges of right and wrong, a pair of old woman touching on what death looks like if not felt, and the mother daughter pair who deal with a little of everything. Including photography, which serves as a classic artist's release, a way to take you out of your head and into what is out there in front of you. Don't expect action, or even any great surprising turn of events. At first I went along with the slow, beautiful pace thinking it was all building to something. And I suppose it was, after all, but nothing that will shock you. It's better than that, and more real, and more touching. The movie and play are both quite good, lacking the finesse and originality of the most amazing works around us, drawing even from Ibsen or Chekhov in the realism and power of very ordinary people in faraway places. The acting is tremendous within the cool dry restraints of the plot, and in fact might make more the the play than is there. If you like a bit of reality without sensation, but just tenderness and meaning, this will work.

    I have now watched the film 3 times (2 times in one day most recently) I have always come upon it without planning. I am now going to own it. Not one wasted word...not one wasted shot. Each character expressing another aspect of the path we travel as mortals. I write...and I am humbled by the stark and simple beauty of it...and it's complete expression of the human condition. To all who participated in its creation... THANK YOU! The guidelines say I have to write more...so the Director, writer and DP clearly shared a vision. Every shot supported each character spoken and unspoken word, thought and deed. It would be so lovely if American film would take a page from this book. Imagine if we started making films about 'thinking people' what that might do for the world. Ahhhh...but alas...so much easier to make the lower choice. Again this film touched my heart in a way few do. Namaste.

    I've been a Rickman fan for a long time, I knew about this film, but I never got to see it at the theaters when it was released. Still, it remained for 10 years in my list of "things to do". I saw it today and I'm not the least disappointed. According to current standards, nothing really happens in this film, yet... so much happens. I simply loved it, it's so subtle, it looks so uncomplicated... apparently, still it talks about so many complicated facts of life: growing older, mother and daughter relationship, sexual awakening. I found the atmosphere superb, you do feel the freezing air around you, the white light makes you feel time stands still somehow. I found it highly recommendable and I keep repeating my summary line, why didn't Rickman ever go back to directing?

    That's the tag line on the VHS tape box...I just bought and watched this delightful film. I had seen it before and I just had to have my own copy (you'll see in almost any movie I review that I repeat this habit...and my room is now bursting with films....) You can tell that this film evolved from a stage play. It is contained and moves only within the confines of the pairs of actors that constitute the simultaneous stories. We are never distracted for a moment with something that comes across the screen that is even remotely tangential to telling these stories. Like a well written play we find ourselves absorbed into the warm human drama, feeling in our hearts time and again a sense of identification. Have we lost a loved one and mismanaged the mourning process? Have we been adolescents who just drop out of the boredom of everyday school life to play at a few hours of hooky? Do we feel frightened growing old as we watch our own children age and grow even more remote from us? Rickman handles the various plots with tenderness, giving each act, even when spliced on top of another, cutting back and forth, a sense of respect and purpose. As in films I have come to really love, this is a quiet film, stripped of pretense, special effects, artifice and overindulgence. We gain a birds eye view of the small scale turmoil of each character, without being overwhelmed, with just enough to urge us to come back for more. In the quiet of this film is an achingly beautiful theme by Michael Kamen. This is an excellent film, even though his first film, and we can only pray that Mr. Rickman finds himself in such artistic frames in the near future. A total delight.

    Don't know about you, but i just loved the movie. It was very interesting to discover Alan Rickman as a Director - and i wasn't disappointed with the result in any way. First, the 'structure' of the movie: tiny episodes from every plot line, their gentle crossing with each other. Then, these plot lines themselves - i found them pictured with more subtlety and tenderness than i had believed possible. What struck me most was the teenage boys' behaviour. Or, to be more precise, the abrupt change in both of them - from cigarettes, swearing, and all this genitals-related speech to the sudden gentle manner when they find and adopt baby kittens. Is it how we grow up? Does it only take a helpless creature, who has nothing and no-one to depend on, to step towards maturity? Frances' (Emma Thompson) drama about her lost husband expresses silent grief, which is more felt than seen from her performance. Her mother Elspeth (Phyllida Law), adds even more emotion to it. While usual movies concentrate on showing the 'action', here the very sight of Elspeth's slow journey towards her daughter's house speaks volumes. What can we learn from her? That old age cannot be fought? Or, that the journey to another soul is long and winding? or both?.. The other two plot lines are magnificent as well. I won't delve into every single moment that made me shudder, for everyone finds their own special episodes. What i can say is that the movie didn't leave any dazzling impressions. No vivid flashbacks. Only a feeling of winter silently creeping into our souls and staying there for long. Not the freezing, icy season. But the feeling of a thick blanket of snow. The thrill you get when you hear snow crackling beneath your feet. The strange yet peaceful emotion when witnessing the earth sleep. Who is the winter guest? Alan Rickman has been asked about it in some interview. He said he didn't know it himself. It might be death, however. Who is the winter guest for every one of us? Death, which comes alien and unexpected. Winter, bringing sleep and slumber into our ordinary lives. Grief, which covers our hearts with ice. Life, which stirs beneath the layers of ice and snow. Different for each and every one. The movie is leaving much space to insert your own emotions and feelings. To accept your own, personal winter guest. I have learned to accept mine.

    What a wonderful film this was. Quiet, thoughtful, beautiful performances. The children and young adults were particularly fine. When it was over, I wanted to see it again. Can one pay greater tribute to a film? Emma Thompson's character was beautifully realized and the subplot of two women arguing as they prepare to attend a funeral was very well done. The Scottish "brogue" spoken by the two boys was a little hard on this American's ears at first, but I quickly adapted - and those two boys proved to be the most compelling characters in the film. This was one of those films that "sneaks" up on you. I started watching it, expecting nothing much, but was drawn into it. I highly recommend it.

    I loved the cinematography in this movie! The story, however, is utterly boring. There's no catalyst, no actual order of events. Emma Thompson is one of the sexiest, most brilliant stars of her time. Her real life mother, Phyllida Law, was also incredible. Overall, however, there was no drive in the film. Will she go to Australia or not? Do we honestly care? No. Even great actors can't save badly written scripts. There wasn't anything really here... Sorry Alan... Sorry Emma... Sorry cast. You're all beautiful and incredible but you need something to do. Life or death. That makes a good movie. And a decent resolution would've been nice.

    There are other overall comments; I thought I would comment on it from a 'quiet psychological drama' POV. As the different pairs of people (mother/bereaved daughter, son/girlfriend, boys, old women) developed their stories, and sometimes criss-crossed, I saw a growing pattern in how they all dealt with their existential lone-ness and lack of drive. The fun but seemingly insignificant (at first) retired ladies hold the key the others seem to echo each in their own way: that if you have a friend, a journey of discovery, and something (or someone) to care for, you can grow in hard conditions, and move on. There are even almost mythical scenes of epiphany about this theme, but I don't know whether Rickmann or MacDonald intended this beautiful mythological pattern to answer the existential crises we face in modern times, but the richness and depth the characters grow into by the end of the film is something that really hit me. A fascinating study that follows the characters so carefully as to teach you things about yourself. Put this in your medicine cabinet for prompt temporary relief of existential despair. If they can find warmth in that bitter chill, there's hope for us too. Not for you if action movies are your thing, of course! Meets my standard for 'movies that improved my life'.

    This started out very bleak... and slow... but once the women leave the room, things start moving and the gist of what appears to be life and how they live it hits you in the head. It's very intellectually done - the grief, lads learning about their sexuality and the curiosity seekers. I was worried that the older lady (Law) would be a menace to her daughter (Thompson), since the younger was dealing with the grief of her husband. She wasn't really. The overall curiosity of death was prevalent, with the older ladies who attended funeral after funeral. Some people deal with death different. I found that very interesting. The boys were such boys - and I'm glad the characters met eventually. It's also well life moved on for the widow. It had a very film noir feel to it. This is not a huge box office show, but somehow I get the feeling everyone can get something from it, no matter the person. It's endearing and a real film about real life. Rickman did a good job for a first time director. I wish he would do more because he has a rich life to tell. Great movie, great for the older kids and parents.

There are even almost mythical scenes of epiphany about this theme, but I don't know whether Rickmann or MacDonald intended this beautiful mythological pattern to answer the existential crises we face in modern times, but the richness and depth the characters grow into by the end of the film is something that really hit me. A fascinating study that follows the characters so carefully as to teach you things about yourself. Put this in your medicine cabinet for prompt temporary relief of existential despair. If they can find warmth in that bitter chill, there's hope for us too. Not for you if action movies are your thing, of course! Meets my standard for 'movies that improved my life'.

    This started out very bleak... and slow... but once the women leave the room, things start moving and the gist of what appears to be life and how they live it hits you in the head. It's very intellectually done - the grief, lads learning about their sexuality and the curiosity seekers. I was worried that the older lady (Law) would be a menace to her daughter (Thompson), since the younger was dealing with the grief of her husband. She wasn't really. The overall curiosity of death was prevalent, with the older ladies who attended funeral after funeral. Some people deal with death different. I found that very interesting. The boys were such boys - and I'm glad the characters met eventually. It's also well life moved on for the widow. It had a very film noir feel to it. This is not a huge box office show, but somehow I get the feeling everyone can get something from it, no matter the person. It's endearing and a real film about real life. Rickman did a good job for a first time director. I wish he would do more because he has a rich life to tell. Great movie, great for the older kids and parents.

    ***SPOILERS*** Artsy smartzy Igmar Bergman like British film that takes place in the dead of winter in a small Scottish town involving some half dozen persons who live there. There's mother and daughter Elspeth & Frances played by Phylida Law & Emma Thompson, who are mother and daughter in real life, who have trouble communicating with each other. Frances a professional photographer is sick and tired of living in the town since her husband suddenly passed away and is seriously thinking of resettling in far off and warm Australia. There's also Frances' teenage son Alex, Garry Hollywood, who's haunted by his father's ghost and is so into himself and his problems that he doesn't see tomboy Nita, Arlne Cockburn, is crazy about him and wants Alex to be her boyfriend every time he passes her riding his bike by the local bus stop. There's also spinsters Lily & Chloe, Sheila Reid & Sandra Voe, who find solace in their boring lives attending funerals for people that they don't know just to put some meaning and excitement into their lives. And finally there's Tom & Sam, Sean Bggerstaff & Dougas Murphy, who just happen to be playing hooky from school who, Tom that is, ends up meeting Elspeth by the shore and unconsciously brings both her and her estranged daughter Frances back together by having her photograph them. The two boys also find two kittens abandoned in a sea cave to their frozen fate and end up adopting them. Which in fact makes them skipping school worthwhile in saving the kittens lives. ***SPOILERS*** By the time the film is over you get the impression that everything was fine between all those involved in it with Elspeth & Frances together again and Alex & Nita now boyfriend and girlfriend. There's also Lily & Chole finally finding, after checking out all the newspapers obituaries, a funeral to attend and someone, the guest of honor, to morn for. The most confusing thing in the movie was what exactly happened to both Tom & Sam together with their kittens? They just seemed to have happily walked off the edge of the earth, into the frozen Arctic Sea, by the time the movie ended?

    The Winter Guest (1997) This has the depth and studious pace and multi-pronged construction of a good play. Which it once was. And like many plays turned to cinema, this carries along some first rate dramatic acting, namely by Emma Thompson and her real life mother, Phyllida Law, playing mother and daughter. As a small twist, the playwright, Sharman Macdonald, is mother to someone else we know, actress Keira Knightley. The scene is a forlorn village in the dead of winter on a Scottish coast. We are shown the first turn of innocent love, a pair of boys playing with the edges of right and wrong, a pair of old woman touching on what death looks like if not felt, and the mother daughter pair who deal with a little of everything. Including photography, which serves as a classic artist's release, a way to take you out of your head and into what is out there in front of you. Don't expect action, or even any great surprising turn of events. At first I went along with the slow, beautiful pace thinking it was all building to something. And I suppose it was, after all, but nothing that will shock you. It's better than that, and more real, and more touching. The movie and play are both quite good, lacking the finesse and originality of the most amazing works around us, drawing even from Ibsen or Chekhov in the realism and power of very ordinary people in faraway places. The acting is tremendous within the cool dry restraints of the plot, and in fact might make more the the play than is there. If you like a bit of reality without sensation, but just tenderness and meaning, this will work.

    I have now watched the film 3 times (2 times in one day most recently) I have always come upon it without planning. I am now going to own it. Not one wasted word...not one wasted shot. Each character expressing another aspect of the path we travel as mortals. I write...and I am humbled by the stark and simple beauty of it...and it's complete expression of the human condition. To all who participated in its creation... THANK YOU! The guidelines say I have to write more...so the Director, writer and DP clearly shared a vision. Every shot supported each character spoken and unspoken word, thought and deed. It would be so lovely if American film would take a page from this book. Imagine if we started making films about 'thinking people' what that might do for the world. Ahhhh...but alas...so much easier to make the lower choice. Again this film touched my heart in a way few do. Namaste.

    I've been a Rickman fan for a long time, I knew about this film, but I never got to see it at the theaters when it was released. Still, it remained for 10 years in my list of "things to do". I saw it today and I'm not the least disappointed. According to current standards, nothing really happens in this film, yet... so much happens. I simply loved it, it's so subtle, it looks so uncomplicated... apparently, still it talks about so many complicated facts of life: growing older, mother and daughter relationship, sexual awakening. I found the atmosphere superb, you do feel the freezing air around you, the white light makes you feel time stands still somehow. I found it highly recommendable and I keep repeating my summary line, why didn't Rickman ever go back to directing?

    That's the tag line on the VHS tape box...I just bought and watched this delightful film. I had seen it before and I just had to have my own copy (you'll see in almost any movie I review that I repeat this habit...and my room is now bursting with films....) You can tell that this film evolved from a stage play. It is contained and moves only within the confines of the pairs of actors that constitute the simultaneous stories. We are never distracted for a moment with something that comes across the screen that is even remotely tangential to telling these stories. Like a well written play we find ourselves absorbed into the warm human drama, feeling in our hearts time and again a sense of identification. Have we lost a loved one and mismanaged the mourning process? Have we been adolescents who just drop out of the boredom of everyday school life to play at a few hours of hooky? Do we feel frightened growing old as we watch our own children age and grow even more remote from us? Rickman handles the various plots with tenderness, giving each act, even when spliced on top of another, cutting back and forth, a sense of respect and purpose. As in films I have come to really love, this is a quiet film, stripped of pretense, special effects, artifice and overindulgence. We gain a birds eye view of the small scale turmoil of each character, without being overwhelmed, with just enough to urge us to come back for more. In the quiet of this film is an achingly beautiful theme by Michael Kamen. This is an excellent film, even though his first film, and we can only pray that Mr. Rickman finds himself in such artistic frames in the near future. A total delight.

    Don't know about you, but i just loved the movie. It was very interesting to discover Alan Rickman as a Director - and i wasn't disappointed with the result in any way. First, the 'structure' of the movie: tiny episodes from every plot line, their gentle crossing with each other. Then, these plot lines themselves - i found them pictured with more subtlety and tenderness than i had believed possible. What struck me most was the teenage boys' behaviour. Or, to be more precise, the abrupt change in both of them - from cigarettes, swearing, and all this genitals-related speech to the sudden gentle manner when they find and adopt baby kittens. Is it how we grow up? Does it only take a helpless creature, who has nothing and no-one to depend on, to step towards maturity? Frances' (Emma Thompson) drama about her lost husband expresses silent grief, which is more felt than seen from her performance. Her mother Elspeth (Phyllida Law), adds even more emotion to it. While usual movies concentrate on showing the 'action', here the very sight of Elspeth's slow journey towards her daughter's house speaks volumes. What can we learn from her? That old age cannot be fought? Or, that the journey to another soul is long and winding? or both?.. The other two plot lines are magnificent as well. I won't delve into every single moment that made me shudder, for everyone finds their own special episodes. What i can say is that the movie didn't leave any dazzling impressions. No vivid flashbacks. Only a feeling of winter silently creeping into our souls and staying there for long. Not the freezing, icy season. But the feeling of a thick blanket of snow. The thrill you get when you hear snow crackling beneath your feet. The strange yet peaceful emotion when witnessing the earth sleep. Who is the winter guest? Alan Rickman has been asked about it in some interview. He said he didn't know it himself. It might be death, however. Who is the winter guest for every one of us? Death, which comes alien and unexpected. Winter, bringing sleep and slumber into our ordinary lives. Grief, which covers our hearts with ice. Life, which stirs beneath the layers of ice and snow. Different for each and every one. The movie is leaving much space to insert your own emotions and feelings. To accept your own, personal winter guest. I have learned to accept mine.

    What a wonderful film this was. Quiet, thoughtful, beautiful performances. The children and young adults were particularly fine. When it was over, I wanted to see it again. Can one pay greater tribute to a film? Emma Thompson's character was beautifully realized and the subplot of two women arguing as they prepare to attend a funeral was very well done. The Scottish "brogue" spoken by the two boys was a little hard on this American's ears at first, but I quickly adapted - and those two boys proved to be the most compelling characters in the film. This was one of those films that "sneaks" up on you. I started watching it, expecting nothing much, but was drawn into it. I highly recommend it.

    I loved the cinematography in this movie! The story, however, is utterly boring. There's no catalyst, no actual order of events. Emma Thompson is one of the sexiest, most brilliant stars of her time. Her real life mother, Phyllida Law, was also incredible. Overall, however, there was no drive in the film. Will she go to Australia or not? Do we honestly care? No. Even great actors can't save badly written scripts. There wasn't anything really here... Sorry Alan... Sorry Emma... Sorry cast. You're all beautiful and incredible but you need something to do. Life or death. That makes a good movie. And a decent resolution would've been nice.

The fun but seemingly insignificant (at first) retired ladies hold the key the others seem to echo each in their own way: that if you have a friend, a journey of discovery, and something (or someone) to care for, you can grow in hard conditions, and move on. There are even almost mythical scenes of epiphany about this theme, but I don't know whether Rickmann or MacDonald intended this beautiful mythological pattern to answer the existential crises we face in modern times, but the richness and depth the characters grow into by the end of the film is something that really hit me. A fascinating study that follows the characters so carefully as to teach you things about yourself. Put this in your medicine cabinet for prompt temporary relief of existential despair. If they can find warmth in that bitter chill, there's hope for us too. Not for you if action movies are your thing, of course! Meets my standard for 'movies that improved my life'.

    This started out very bleak... and slow... but once the women leave the room, things start moving and the gist of what appears to be life and how they live it hits you in the head. It's very intellectually done - the grief, lads learning about their sexuality and the curiosity seekers. I was worried that the older lady (Law) would be a menace to her daughter (Thompson), since the younger was dealing with the grief of her husband. She wasn't really. The overall curiosity of death was prevalent, with the older ladies who attended funeral after funeral. Some people deal with death different. I found that very interesting. The boys were such boys - and I'm glad the characters met eventually. It's also well life moved on for the widow. It had a very film noir feel to it. This is not a huge box office show, but somehow I get the feeling everyone can get something from it, no matter the person. It's endearing and a real film about real life. Rickman did a good job for a first time director. I wish he would do more because he has a rich life to tell. Great movie, great for the older kids and parents.

    ***SPOILERS*** Artsy smartzy Igmar Bergman like British film that takes place in the dead of winter in a small Scottish town involving some half dozen persons who live there. There's mother and daughter Elspeth & Frances played by Phylida Law & Emma Thompson, who are mother and daughter in real life, who have trouble communicating with each other. Frances a professional photographer is sick and tired of living in the town since her husband suddenly passed away and is seriously thinking of resettling in far off and warm Australia. There's also Frances' teenage son Alex, Garry Hollywood, who's haunted by his father's ghost and is so into himself and his problems that he doesn't see tomboy Nita, Arlne Cockburn, is crazy about him and wants Alex to be her boyfriend every time he passes her riding his bike by the local bus stop. There's also spinsters Lily & Chloe, Sheila Reid & Sandra Voe, who find solace in their boring lives attending funerals for people that they don't know just to put some meaning and excitement into their lives. And finally there's Tom & Sam, Sean Bggerstaff & Dougas Murphy, who just happen to be playing hooky from school who, Tom that is, ends up meeting Elspeth by the shore and unconsciously brings both her and her estranged daughter Frances back together by having her photograph them. The two boys also find two kittens abandoned in a sea cave to their frozen fate and end up adopting them. Which in fact makes them skipping school worthwhile in saving the kittens lives. ***SPOILERS*** By the time the film is over you get the impression that everything was fine between all those involved in it with Elspeth & Frances together again and Alex & Nita now boyfriend and girlfriend. There's also Lily & Chole finally finding, after checking out all the newspapers obituaries, a funeral to attend and someone, the guest of honor, to morn for. The most confusing thing in the movie was what exactly happened to both Tom & Sam together with their kittens? They just seemed to have happily walked off the edge of the earth, into the frozen Arctic Sea, by the time the movie ended?

    The Winter Guest (1997) This has the depth and studious pace and multi-pronged construction of a good play. Which it once was. And like many plays turned to cinema, this carries along some first rate dramatic acting, namely by Emma Thompson and her real life mother, Phyllida Law, playing mother and daughter. As a small twist, the playwright, Sharman Macdonald, is mother to someone else we know, actress Keira Knightley. The scene is a forlorn village in the dead of winter on a Scottish coast. We are shown the first turn of innocent love, a pair of boys playing with the edges of right and wrong, a pair of old woman touching on what death looks like if not felt, and the mother daughter pair who deal with a little of everything. Including photography, which serves as a classic artist's release, a way to take you out of your head and into what is out there in front of you. Don't expect action, or even any great surprising turn of events. At first I went along with the slow, beautiful pace thinking it was all building to something. And I suppose it was, after all, but nothing that will shock you. It's better than that, and more real, and more touching. The movie and play are both quite good, lacking the finesse and originality of the most amazing works around us, drawing even from Ibsen or Chekhov in the realism and power of very ordinary people in faraway places. The acting is tremendous within the cool dry restraints of the plot, and in fact might make more the the play than is there. If you like a bit of reality without sensation, but just tenderness and meaning, this will work.

    I have now watched the film 3 times (2 times in one day most recently) I have always come upon it without planning. I am now going to own it. Not one wasted word...not one wasted shot. Each character expressing another aspect of the path we travel as mortals. I write...and I am humbled by the stark and simple beauty of it...and it's complete expression of the human condition. To all who participated in its creation... THANK YOU! The guidelines say I have to write more...so the Director, writer and DP clearly shared a vision. Every shot supported each character spoken and unspoken word, thought and deed. It would be so lovely if American film would take a page from this book. Imagine if we started making films about 'thinking people' what that might do for the world. Ahhhh...but alas...so much easier to make the lower choice. Again this film touched my heart in a way few do. Namaste.

    I've been a Rickman fan for a long time, I knew about this film, but I never got to see it at the theaters when it was released. Still, it remained for 10 years in my list of "things to do". I saw it today and I'm not the least disappointed. According to current standards, nothing really happens in this film, yet... so much happens. I simply loved it, it's so subtle, it looks so uncomplicated... apparently, still it talks about so many complicated facts of life: growing older, mother and daughter relationship, sexual awakening. I found the atmosphere superb, you do feel the freezing air around you, the white light makes you feel time stands still somehow. I found it highly recommendable and I keep repeating my summary line, why didn't Rickman ever go back to directing?

    That's the tag line on the VHS tape box...I just bought and watched this delightful film. I had seen it before and I just had to have my own copy (you'll see in almost any movie I review that I repeat this habit...and my room is now bursting with films....) You can tell that this film evolved from a stage play. It is contained and moves only within the confines of the pairs of actors that constitute the simultaneous stories. We are never distracted for a moment with something that comes across the screen that is even remotely tangential to telling these stories. Like a well written play we find ourselves absorbed into the warm human drama, feeling in our hearts time and again a sense of identification. Have we lost a loved one and mismanaged the mourning process? Have we been adolescents who just drop out of the boredom of everyday school life to play at a few hours of hooky? Do we feel frightened growing old as we watch our own children age and grow even more remote from us? Rickman handles the various plots with tenderness, giving each act, even when spliced on top of another, cutting back and forth, a sense of respect and purpose. As in films I have come to really love, this is a quiet film, stripped of pretense, special effects, artifice and overindulgence. We gain a birds eye view of the small scale turmoil of each character, without being overwhelmed, with just enough to urge us to come back for more. In the quiet of this film is an achingly beautiful theme by Michael Kamen. This is an excellent film, even though his first film, and we can only pray that Mr. Rickman finds himself in such artistic frames in the near future. A total delight.

    Don't know about you, but i just loved the movie. It was very interesting to discover Alan Rickman as a Director - and i wasn't disappointed with the result in any way. First, the 'structure' of the movie: tiny episodes from every plot line, their gentle crossing with each other. Then, these plot lines themselves - i found them pictured with more subtlety and tenderness than i had believed possible. What struck me most was the teenage boys' behaviour. Or, to be more precise, the abrupt change in both of them - from cigarettes, swearing, and all this genitals-related speech to the sudden gentle manner when they find and adopt baby kittens. Is it how we grow up? Does it only take a helpless creature, who has nothing and no-one to depend on, to step towards maturity? Frances' (Emma Thompson) drama about her lost husband expresses silent grief, which is more felt than seen from her performance. Her mother Elspeth (Phyllida Law), adds even more emotion to it. While usual movies concentrate on showing the 'action', here the very sight of Elspeth's slow journey towards her daughter's house speaks volumes. What can we learn from her? That old age cannot be fought? Or, that the journey to another soul is long and winding? or both?.. The other two plot lines are magnificent as well. I won't delve into every single moment that made me shudder, for everyone finds their own special episodes. What i can say is that the movie didn't leave any dazzling impressions. No vivid flashbacks. Only a feeling of winter silently creeping into our souls and staying there for long. Not the freezing, icy season. But the feeling of a thick blanket of snow. The thrill you get when you hear snow crackling beneath your feet. The strange yet peaceful emotion when witnessing the earth sleep. Who is the winter guest? Alan Rickman has been asked about it in some interview. He said he didn't know it himself. It might be death, however. Who is the winter guest for every one of us? Death, which comes alien and unexpected. Winter, bringing sleep and slumber into our ordinary lives. Grief, which covers our hearts with ice. Life, which stirs beneath the layers of ice and snow. Different for each and every one. The movie is leaving much space to insert your own emotions and feelings. To accept your own, personal winter guest. I have learned to accept mine.

    What a wonderful film this was. Quiet, thoughtful, beautiful performances. The children and young adults were particularly fine. When it was over, I wanted to see it again. Can one pay greater tribute to a film? Emma Thompson's character was beautifully realized and the subplot of two women arguing as they prepare to attend a funeral was very well done. The Scottish "brogue" spoken by the two boys was a little hard on this American's ears at first, but I quickly adapted - and those two boys proved to be the most compelling characters in the film. This was one of those films that "sneaks" up on you. I started watching it, expecting nothing much, but was drawn into it. I highly recommend it.

    I loved the cinematography in this movie! The story, however, is utterly boring. There's no catalyst, no actual order of events. Emma Thompson is one of the sexiest, most brilliant stars of her time. Her real life mother, Phyllida Law, was also incredible. Overall, however, there was no drive in the film. Will she go to Australia or not? Do we honestly care? No. Even great actors can't save badly written scripts. There wasn't anything really here... Sorry Alan... Sorry Emma... Sorry cast. You're all beautiful and incredible but you need something to do. Life or death. That makes a good movie. And a decent resolution would've been nice.
