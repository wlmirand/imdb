 <sinopse>
  A paranormal expert and his daughter bunk in an abandoned house populated by 3 mischievous ghosts and one friendly one.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Furious that her late father only willed her his gloomy-looking mansion rather than his millions, Carrigan Crittenden is ready to burn the place to the ground when she discovers a map to a treasure hidden in the house. But when she enters the rickety mansion to seek her claim, she is frightened away by a wicked wave of ghosts. Determined to get her hands on this hidden fortune, she hires afterlife therapist Dr. James Harvey to exorcise the ghosts from the mansion. Harvey and his daughter Kat move in, and soon Kat meets Casper, the ghost of a young boy who's "the friendliest ghost you know." But not so friendly are Casper's uncles--Stretch, Fatso and Stinkie--who are determined to drive all "fleshies" away. Ultimately, it is up to Harvey and Kat to help the ghosts cross over to the other side.

    Taking the classic comic book and cartoon onto the big screen, this version of the story of the friendly ghost gives the viewer an inside look as to who Casper really was and his life before and after becoming the sweet spirit. Fresh from her star-making role of Wednesday Addams, Christina Ricci is perfect to play the poor child who is initially scared of him but soon wants to help the spirit of the child find out the truths. Her father Bill Pullman also gets involved as do the sinister Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarty as the agent and owner of the house who hire Pullman to get rid of the spooks which includes more than just Casper. Moriarty is particularly entertaining as one of the most outrageous of greedy characters, and her shrieking (which made her the scene stealer of "Soap Dish") takes over here as well to make her unforgettably funny. There are some delightful surprises in this mostly sweet-natured tale of the tying together of two different generations of children, one live, the other dead, the greed of adults, and the Peter Pan like belief in a world beyond our grasp. Try not to feel tears of joy and nostalgia when Casper takes Ricci on the train ride to his long hidden bedroom and is later allowed to face the truth of why he is who he is. Ricci and Pullman too also face the loss of their mother and wife, although one of Casper's prankster uncle ghosts also gets in the way comically. This is a family film that proves to be innocent yet never juvenile and cloying.

    In its spookiest and most poignant moments (such as Bill Pullman being reunited with his dead wife), 'Casper' hints that it suffers from a bad case of unfulfilled potential. It's enjoyable enough, and the cartoony CG effects are pretty good despite being used to realise characters as irritating as Casper's obnoxious uncles. The problem is the lightweight treatment of what could have been a darker and more memorable kids' film: Brad Silberling's direction fails to conjure up any magic, the humour isn't that funny, and the numerous cameos are pointless (although Dan Aykroyd gets a laugh). It's all frustratingly uneven and underdeveloped, but as it's so forgettable the frustration doesn't last long.

    Childhood memories. As of recently I have been re-watching some movies I watched and liked as a kid. From what I remembered this was one of the better ones so I decided to sit down and take a look at it. The plot, it's very disjointed but I'll say it in the best way possible. A woman inherits one of her father's condemned mansions. Once she finds out it holds a treasure somewhere they look inside it only for it to be haunted by three mischievous ghosts and one friendly one. Ghost hunter after ghost hunter fails so they get a psychologist who specialises in getting ghost's unfinished business done. After that it shifts to the psychologist and his daughter talking to the ghosts, the daughter going to school, her and Casper developing a friendship. Onto the complaints as I said the plot is disjointed, some of the dialogue does get extremely weak around the middle and that it does seem a little bit more reliant on special effects than anything else. Although unlike other movies where this happens (if you want an example look at the movies playing in your theater, that's full of them) this one actually has heart (it maybe to a small extent but it does have heart). Now, if you're looking for a mindless watch that is humorous and entertaining then this could be for you - you could do with a lot worse. The three uncles are worth watching for their humour along with Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarty as the villain. I also enjoyed the soundtrack for this movie. It is very fitting and although most of the time it is the same melody it doesn't get irritating. So if you want an hour and a half of mindless entertainment of family fun then this might be the one for you. Don't expect much but it is worth watching if you have kids and they want to see something new that you might also enjoy.

    This is a perfect motion picture. It is fun, funny, and will bring tears to your eyes as it overflows with innocent romance and love. It amazes me how so much garbage that comes out of Hollywood, unwatchable garbage like "Avatar" and all those super hero movies, yet this masterpiece of writing,acting and special effects is shunned. There are many good reviews so I shall keep it short. A teen girl moves with her "ghost Psychologist" father to a haunted house to clear it out for a price. Casper lives there and is a sweet ghost and former 12 year old boy, now turned ghost. His fun and crazy three ghost "uncles" live there too and havoc ensues. The evil owner and her hilarious personal secretary (Eric Idle of Monty Python) are the real trouble makers. The friendship and romance between Ricci and "Casper" is perfect. The line that breaks my heart is when Kat (Ricci) is falling asleep and Casper cuddles up and says "Can I keep you"? It is a perfect motion picture and I watch it 5-6 times a year. Originally, the haunted house was going to be my favorite empty mansion in my home town (yes, I recommended it). Yale Univ. messed that up and the fake house they used is perfect.

    Casper is a movie that I enjoy watching over again even after 17 years this 1995 movie is very impressive, the acting and performance that both Pullman and Ricci pulled off is one that I sure admire, as both actors had to act without anything being there, as the ghosts were CGI effects added after filming, so when this two act scared and are talking, there were doing it talking to just air. The movie is interesting and likable, the plot holes are very obvious, with the whole crossing over thing, but the movie production is good enough to make you ignore the plot holes. The movie is based on a Children's book titled: The Friendly Ghost released in 1939 and an animated series done in 1945. It is directed by Brad Siberling who did a moderately good job here and who went ahead to direct City of Angels (1998) which was also not well received and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004). The movie plot starts with the antagonist Carrigan discovering that her late father willed to her an abandoned house. This made her furious cause all she wanted were his money. While disposing of the papers to the house she discovered a paper saying that there is a treasure hidden in the house. She, now ready to get the treasure goes to the house only to discover that it is being haunted by 4 ghosts, so she hired Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) to help exorcise the ghost. James moved into the house, with her daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) although James has experience dealing with ghost he has not actually seen one, so both he and his daughter were scared to bits when they moved in. They soon discovered to among the 4 ghost that there is a friendly one named Casper. With Carrigan deadline approaching James is stuck with the task of getting rid of the Ghost who seemed to be rather enjoying their haunted house. Casper was a huge commercial success bringing in way over 280 million from its 55 million production cost, but the movie didn't receive good reviews, holding a 44% approval rating from critics in rotten tomatoes. The movie's down side is the role of the antagonist Carrigan (played by Cathy Moriarty), she seemed viciously stupid, the writers made her money hungry which in turn made her throw it all away just to get a treasure box, a treasure box that she did not know what it contained. Putting it all together, this is a nice DVD to own. Casper had two sequels (that I know off) Casper: A Spirited Beginning (1997) and Casper meets Wendy (1998). The sequels featured new people, but the ghosts Casper, Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso all were present in the sequels Cathy Moriarty who played Carrigan in this movie was also in Casper meets Wendy in the movie she plays the head witch. None of the sequels are anywhere as good as this original, so don't even bother. www.lagsreviews.com

    As a child there were few movies that I enjoyed watching over and over again, but once in a while there was that one movie that just impacted me. Casper is one of those movies...the acting may not be the best and many may have taken the movie too seriously upon seeing the reviews. But the overall message and story of Casper is wonderful, and I want my children to be able to watch this someday and enjoy it as much as I certainly have. Thank you Bill Pullman for once again putting your style into such a unique and fun movie. Plus I get a kick out of the one guy with the monotone voice who was in the eye-drop commercials every time, forgive me I am too lazy to look up his name.

    Casper is a charming "family" film about a talking ghost who tries to make friends with humans, but the humans are too stupid and scared of him. Casper has three greedy uncles called Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, they like to be very rude and embarrassing towards Casper. Casper eventually manages to make friends with a young woman called Kat, but how will their friendship stay strong with three greedy ghosts in the house? The film is charming and funny with likable characters and laughably cheesy acting, it does not stop people from enjoying it, all though; it is deliberately over the top at times. If parents don't want their children to watch films with lots of screaming in, young children may need to watch it with their parents. I heard there were more Casper Films (Casper: A Spirited Beginning, Casper Meets Wendy, etc), but I can't ever remember seeing them, as I was told by other users that they were dreadful. Overall, Casper is a funny, but very silly film and it does go other the top of children's head's at times, but it is a guilty pleasure; nonetheless. 8/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    I remember watching this when I was about their age. It was one of my favorite childhood movies that I lost for many years. Casper is basically a really really sad romantic comedy for kids. Sounds like it'd be cheesy, but the comedy is distinct from the emotional bits so it's not a jumbled mess. The actors are good enough to make you give it a chance, and it just takes you from there. Casper might just be the most relatable character in film. How can't you like him? The voice actor does a fantastic job, and makes him sound like a introverted country kid without any friends. I cannot recommend it enough. 10/10

    Well, he still is. When I watched the Nostalgia Critic episode reviewing this movie, I can't believe how ungodly annoying he is. I feel like I just want to punch that flying, balding little yobbo square in the face. I mean he's so annoying he makes Spongebob Squarepants look like a normal person. But, never mind that episode, let's take a good long look at this movie. 1) The pointless cameos. Okay, don't get me wrong but Clint Eastwood, Dan Akroyd, and Ben Stein are way too talented to make cameo appearances in this moronic piece of monkey diarrhea. 2) Overuse of puns. "California Roll", "Smell-o-gram", "Closet Case", and a dozen others make no sense and aren't funny even if you TRY(emphasis on the word try) to put effort in them. 3) Casper. When I was a kid, Casper was a kind of friendly ghost you'd know(Just like in the cartoon's theme song), but adults and animals would turn literally white and run away if they come across him and that's for laughs. Well, in this movie, maybe Casper got a little TOO friendly. Just don't expect this ghost to come back and haunt you anytime soon, that's all I could say.

    Just about every single cartoon has been turned into a feature length film. So in 1995 Universal decided to do a film of Casper. So to ask the same question as I did in my Josie And The Pussycats Review, Does it work? The film is about Dr. James Harvey played by Bill Pullman and his daughter Kat played by Christina Ricci who move into a new house in Friendship, Maine. Little do they Know that the house they moved into has a friendly ghost named Casper. The house is also being over run by SNOOTY rich girl Carrigan Crittendon played by Cathy Moriarty and her assistant Dibs played By Eric Idle who want the fortune in the house. This movie works in so many ways because I think it appeals more to adults than to kids. This is a really vulgar film filled with a ton of curse words and sexual innuendos. The film is very funny (Especially The cameo made by Dan Akroyd playing Ray From Ghostbusters)and I would pop this movie in anytime of the day. Definitely check this out. Rated PG For Mild Language And Thematic Elements. 1hr 41min/101min. ****/****

"California Roll", "Smell-o-gram", "Closet Case", and a dozen others make no sense and aren't funny even if you TRY(emphasis on the word try) to put effort in them. 3) Casper. When I was a kid, Casper was a kind of friendly ghost you'd know(Just like in the cartoon's theme song), but adults and animals would turn literally white and run away if they come across him and that's for laughs. Well, in this movie, maybe Casper got a little TOO friendly. Just don't expect this ghost to come back and haunt you anytime soon, that's all I could say.

    Just about every single cartoon has been turned into a feature length film. So in 1995 Universal decided to do a film of Casper. So to ask the same question as I did in my Josie And The Pussycats Review, Does it work? The film is about Dr. James Harvey played by Bill Pullman and his daughter Kat played by Christina Ricci who move into a new house in Friendship, Maine. Little do they Know that the house they moved into has a friendly ghost named Casper. The house is also being over run by SNOOTY rich girl Carrigan Crittendon played by Cathy Moriarty and her assistant Dibs played By Eric Idle who want the fortune in the house. This movie works in so many ways because I think it appeals more to adults than to kids. This is a really vulgar film filled with a ton of curse words and sexual innuendos. The film is very funny (Especially The cameo made by Dan Akroyd playing Ray From Ghostbusters)and I would pop this movie in anytime of the day. Definitely check this out. Rated PG For Mild Language And Thematic Elements. 1hr 41min/101min. ****/****

    Taking the classic comic book and cartoon onto the big screen, this version of the story of the friendly ghost gives the viewer an inside look as to who Casper really was and his life before and after becoming the sweet spirit. Fresh from her star-making role of Wednesday Addams, Christina Ricci is perfect to play the poor child who is initially scared of him but soon wants to help the spirit of the child find out the truths. Her father Bill Pullman also gets involved as do the sinister Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarty as the agent and owner of the house who hire Pullman to get rid of the spooks which includes more than just Casper. Moriarty is particularly entertaining as one of the most outrageous of greedy characters, and her shrieking (which made her the scene stealer of "Soap Dish") takes over here as well to make her unforgettably funny. There are some delightful surprises in this mostly sweet-natured tale of the tying together of two different generations of children, one live, the other dead, the greed of adults, and the Peter Pan like belief in a world beyond our grasp. Try not to feel tears of joy and nostalgia when Casper takes Ricci on the train ride to his long hidden bedroom and is later allowed to face the truth of why he is who he is. Ricci and Pullman too also face the loss of their mother and wife, although one of Casper's prankster uncle ghosts also gets in the way comically. This is a family film that proves to be innocent yet never juvenile and cloying.

    In its spookiest and most poignant moments (such as Bill Pullman being reunited with his dead wife), 'Casper' hints that it suffers from a bad case of unfulfilled potential. It's enjoyable enough, and the cartoony CG effects are pretty good despite being used to realise characters as irritating as Casper's obnoxious uncles. The problem is the lightweight treatment of what could have been a darker and more memorable kids' film: Brad Silberling's direction fails to conjure up any magic, the humour isn't that funny, and the numerous cameos are pointless (although Dan Aykroyd gets a laugh). It's all frustratingly uneven and underdeveloped, but as it's so forgettable the frustration doesn't last long.

    Childhood memories. As of recently I have been re-watching some movies I watched and liked as a kid. From what I remembered this was one of the better ones so I decided to sit down and take a look at it. The plot, it's very disjointed but I'll say it in the best way possible. A woman inherits one of her father's condemned mansions. Once she finds out it holds a treasure somewhere they look inside it only for it to be haunted by three mischievous ghosts and one friendly one. Ghost hunter after ghost hunter fails so they get a psychologist who specialises in getting ghost's unfinished business done. After that it shifts to the psychologist and his daughter talking to the ghosts, the daughter going to school, her and Casper developing a friendship. Onto the complaints as I said the plot is disjointed, some of the dialogue does get extremely weak around the middle and that it does seem a little bit more reliant on special effects than anything else. Although unlike other movies where this happens (if you want an example look at the movies playing in your theater, that's full of them) this one actually has heart (it maybe to a small extent but it does have heart). Now, if you're looking for a mindless watch that is humorous and entertaining then this could be for you - you could do with a lot worse. The three uncles are worth watching for their humour along with Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarty as the villain. I also enjoyed the soundtrack for this movie. It is very fitting and although most of the time it is the same melody it doesn't get irritating. So if you want an hour and a half of mindless entertainment of family fun then this might be the one for you. Don't expect much but it is worth watching if you have kids and they want to see something new that you might also enjoy.

    This is a perfect motion picture. It is fun, funny, and will bring tears to your eyes as it overflows with innocent romance and love. It amazes me how so much garbage that comes out of Hollywood, unwatchable garbage like "Avatar" and all those super hero movies, yet this masterpiece of writing,acting and special effects is shunned. There are many good reviews so I shall keep it short. A teen girl moves with her "ghost Psychologist" father to a haunted house to clear it out for a price. Casper lives there and is a sweet ghost and former 12 year old boy, now turned ghost. His fun and crazy three ghost "uncles" live there too and havoc ensues. The evil owner and her hilarious personal secretary (Eric Idle of Monty Python) are the real trouble makers. The friendship and romance between Ricci and "Casper" is perfect. The line that breaks my heart is when Kat (Ricci) is falling asleep and Casper cuddles up and says "Can I keep you"? It is a perfect motion picture and I watch it 5-6 times a year. Originally, the haunted house was going to be my favorite empty mansion in my home town (yes, I recommended it). Yale Univ. messed that up and the fake house they used is perfect.

    Casper is a movie that I enjoy watching over again even after 17 years this 1995 movie is very impressive, the acting and performance that both Pullman and Ricci pulled off is one that I sure admire, as both actors had to act without anything being there, as the ghosts were CGI effects added after filming, so when this two act scared and are talking, there were doing it talking to just air. The movie is interesting and likable, the plot holes are very obvious, with the whole crossing over thing, but the movie production is good enough to make you ignore the plot holes. The movie is based on a Children's book titled: The Friendly Ghost released in 1939 and an animated series done in 1945. It is directed by Brad Siberling who did a moderately good job here and who went ahead to direct City of Angels (1998) which was also not well received and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004). The movie plot starts with the antagonist Carrigan discovering that her late father willed to her an abandoned house. This made her furious cause all she wanted were his money. While disposing of the papers to the house she discovered a paper saying that there is a treasure hidden in the house. She, now ready to get the treasure goes to the house only to discover that it is being haunted by 4 ghosts, so she hired Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) to help exorcise the ghost. James moved into the house, with her daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) although James has experience dealing with ghost he has not actually seen one, so both he and his daughter were scared to bits when they moved in. They soon discovered to among the 4 ghost that there is a friendly one named Casper. With Carrigan deadline approaching James is stuck with the task of getting rid of the Ghost who seemed to be rather enjoying their haunted house. Casper was a huge commercial success bringing in way over 280 million from its 55 million production cost, but the movie didn't receive good reviews, holding a 44% approval rating from critics in rotten tomatoes. The movie's down side is the role of the antagonist Carrigan (played by Cathy Moriarty), she seemed viciously stupid, the writers made her money hungry which in turn made her throw it all away just to get a treasure box, a treasure box that she did not know what it contained. Putting it all together, this is a nice DVD to own. Casper had two sequels (that I know off) Casper: A Spirited Beginning (1997) and Casper meets Wendy (1998). The sequels featured new people, but the ghosts Casper, Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso all were present in the sequels Cathy Moriarty who played Carrigan in this movie was also in Casper meets Wendy in the movie she plays the head witch. None of the sequels are anywhere as good as this original, so don't even bother. www.lagsreviews.com

    As a child there were few movies that I enjoyed watching over and over again, but once in a while there was that one movie that just impacted me. Casper is one of those movies...the acting may not be the best and many may have taken the movie too seriously upon seeing the reviews. But the overall message and story of Casper is wonderful, and I want my children to be able to watch this someday and enjoy it as much as I certainly have. Thank you Bill Pullman for once again putting your style into such a unique and fun movie. Plus I get a kick out of the one guy with the monotone voice who was in the eye-drop commercials every time, forgive me I am too lazy to look up his name.

    Casper is a charming "family" film about a talking ghost who tries to make friends with humans, but the humans are too stupid and scared of him. Casper has three greedy uncles called Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, they like to be very rude and embarrassing towards Casper. Casper eventually manages to make friends with a young woman called Kat, but how will their friendship stay strong with three greedy ghosts in the house? The film is charming and funny with likable characters and laughably cheesy acting, it does not stop people from enjoying it, all though; it is deliberately over the top at times. If parents don't want their children to watch films with lots of screaming in, young children may need to watch it with their parents. I heard there were more Casper Films (Casper: A Spirited Beginning, Casper Meets Wendy, etc), but I can't ever remember seeing them, as I was told by other users that they were dreadful. Overall, Casper is a funny, but very silly film and it does go other the top of children's head's at times, but it is a guilty pleasure; nonetheless. 8/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    I remember watching this when I was about their age. It was one of my favorite childhood movies that I lost for many years. Casper is basically a really really sad romantic comedy for kids. Sounds like it'd be cheesy, but the comedy is distinct from the emotional bits so it's not a jumbled mess. The actors are good enough to make you give it a chance, and it just takes you from there. Casper might just be the most relatable character in film. How can't you like him? The voice actor does a fantastic job, and makes him sound like a introverted country kid without any friends. I cannot recommend it enough. 10/10

    Well, he still is. When I watched the Nostalgia Critic episode reviewing this movie, I can't believe how ungodly annoying he is. I feel like I just want to punch that flying, balding little yobbo square in the face. I mean he's so annoying he makes Spongebob Squarepants look like a normal person. But, never mind that episode, let's take a good long look at this movie. 1) The pointless cameos. Okay, don't get me wrong but Clint Eastwood, Dan Akroyd, and Ben Stein are way too talented to make cameo appearances in this moronic piece of monkey diarrhea. 2) Overuse of puns.

When I was a kid, Casper was a kind of friendly ghost you'd know(Just like in the cartoon's theme song), but adults and animals would turn literally white and run away if they come across him and that's for laughs. Well, in this movie, maybe Casper got a little TOO friendly. Just don't expect this ghost to come back and haunt you anytime soon, that's all I could say.

    Just about every single cartoon has been turned into a feature length film. So in 1995 Universal decided to do a film of Casper. So to ask the same question as I did in my Josie And The Pussycats Review, Does it work? The film is about Dr. James Harvey played by Bill Pullman and his daughter Kat played by Christina Ricci who move into a new house in Friendship, Maine. Little do they Know that the house they moved into has a friendly ghost named Casper. The house is also being over run by SNOOTY rich girl Carrigan Crittendon played by Cathy Moriarty and her assistant Dibs played By Eric Idle who want the fortune in the house. This movie works in so many ways because I think it appeals more to adults than to kids. This is a really vulgar film filled with a ton of curse words and sexual innuendos. The film is very funny (Especially The cameo made by Dan Akroyd playing Ray From Ghostbusters)and I would pop this movie in anytime of the day. Definitely check this out. Rated PG For Mild Language And Thematic Elements. 1hr 41min/101min. ****/****

    Taking the classic comic book and cartoon onto the big screen, this version of the story of the friendly ghost gives the viewer an inside look as to who Casper really was and his life before and after becoming the sweet spirit. Fresh from her star-making role of Wednesday Addams, Christina Ricci is perfect to play the poor child who is initially scared of him but soon wants to help the spirit of the child find out the truths. Her father Bill Pullman also gets involved as do the sinister Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarty as the agent and owner of the house who hire Pullman to get rid of the spooks which includes more than just Casper. Moriarty is particularly entertaining as one of the most outrageous of greedy characters, and her shrieking (which made her the scene stealer of "Soap Dish") takes over here as well to make her unforgettably funny. There are some delightful surprises in this mostly sweet-natured tale of the tying together of two different generations of children, one live, the other dead, the greed of adults, and the Peter Pan like belief in a world beyond our grasp. Try not to feel tears of joy and nostalgia when Casper takes Ricci on the train ride to his long hidden bedroom and is later allowed to face the truth of why he is who he is. Ricci and Pullman too also face the loss of their mother and wife, although one of Casper's prankster uncle ghosts also gets in the way comically. This is a family film that proves to be innocent yet never juvenile and cloying.

    In its spookiest and most poignant moments (such as Bill Pullman being reunited with his dead wife), 'Casper' hints that it suffers from a bad case of unfulfilled potential. It's enjoyable enough, and the cartoony CG effects are pretty good despite being used to realise characters as irritating as Casper's obnoxious uncles. The problem is the lightweight treatment of what could have been a darker and more memorable kids' film: Brad Silberling's direction fails to conjure up any magic, the humour isn't that funny, and the numerous cameos are pointless (although Dan Aykroyd gets a laugh). It's all frustratingly uneven and underdeveloped, but as it's so forgettable the frustration doesn't last long.

    Childhood memories. As of recently I have been re-watching some movies I watched and liked as a kid. From what I remembered this was one of the better ones so I decided to sit down and take a look at it. The plot, it's very disjointed but I'll say it in the best way possible. A woman inherits one of her father's condemned mansions. Once she finds out it holds a treasure somewhere they look inside it only for it to be haunted by three mischievous ghosts and one friendly one. Ghost hunter after ghost hunter fails so they get a psychologist who specialises in getting ghost's unfinished business done. After that it shifts to the psychologist and his daughter talking to the ghosts, the daughter going to school, her and Casper developing a friendship. Onto the complaints as I said the plot is disjointed, some of the dialogue does get extremely weak around the middle and that it does seem a little bit more reliant on special effects than anything else. Although unlike other movies where this happens (if you want an example look at the movies playing in your theater, that's full of them) this one actually has heart (it maybe to a small extent but it does have heart). Now, if you're looking for a mindless watch that is humorous and entertaining then this could be for you - you could do with a lot worse. The three uncles are worth watching for their humour along with Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarty as the villain. I also enjoyed the soundtrack for this movie. It is very fitting and although most of the time it is the same melody it doesn't get irritating. So if you want an hour and a half of mindless entertainment of family fun then this might be the one for you. Don't expect much but it is worth watching if you have kids and they want to see something new that you might also enjoy.

    This is a perfect motion picture. It is fun, funny, and will bring tears to your eyes as it overflows with innocent romance and love. It amazes me how so much garbage that comes out of Hollywood, unwatchable garbage like "Avatar" and all those super hero movies, yet this masterpiece of writing,acting and special effects is shunned. There are many good reviews so I shall keep it short. A teen girl moves with her "ghost Psychologist" father to a haunted house to clear it out for a price. Casper lives there and is a sweet ghost and former 12 year old boy, now turned ghost. His fun and crazy three ghost "uncles" live there too and havoc ensues. The evil owner and her hilarious personal secretary (Eric Idle of Monty Python) are the real trouble makers. The friendship and romance between Ricci and "Casper" is perfect. The line that breaks my heart is when Kat (Ricci) is falling asleep and Casper cuddles up and says "Can I keep you"? It is a perfect motion picture and I watch it 5-6 times a year. Originally, the haunted house was going to be my favorite empty mansion in my home town (yes, I recommended it). Yale Univ. messed that up and the fake house they used is perfect.

    Casper is a movie that I enjoy watching over again even after 17 years this 1995 movie is very impressive, the acting and performance that both Pullman and Ricci pulled off is one that I sure admire, as both actors had to act without anything being there, as the ghosts were CGI effects added after filming, so when this two act scared and are talking, there were doing it talking to just air. The movie is interesting and likable, the plot holes are very obvious, with the whole crossing over thing, but the movie production is good enough to make you ignore the plot holes. The movie is based on a Children's book titled: The Friendly Ghost released in 1939 and an animated series done in 1945. It is directed by Brad Siberling who did a moderately good job here and who went ahead to direct City of Angels (1998) which was also not well received and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004). The movie plot starts with the antagonist Carrigan discovering that her late father willed to her an abandoned house. This made her furious cause all she wanted were his money. While disposing of the papers to the house she discovered a paper saying that there is a treasure hidden in the house. She, now ready to get the treasure goes to the house only to discover that it is being haunted by 4 ghosts, so she hired Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) to help exorcise the ghost. James moved into the house, with her daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) although James has experience dealing with ghost he has not actually seen one, so both he and his daughter were scared to bits when they moved in. They soon discovered to among the 4 ghost that there is a friendly one named Casper. With Carrigan deadline approaching James is stuck with the task of getting rid of the Ghost who seemed to be rather enjoying their haunted house. Casper was a huge commercial success bringing in way over 280 million from its 55 million production cost, but the movie didn't receive good reviews, holding a 44% approval rating from critics in rotten tomatoes. The movie's down side is the role of the antagonist Carrigan (played by Cathy Moriarty), she seemed viciously stupid, the writers made her money hungry which in turn made her throw it all away just to get a treasure box, a treasure box that she did not know what it contained. Putting it all together, this is a nice DVD to own. Casper had two sequels (that I know off) Casper: A Spirited Beginning (1997) and Casper meets Wendy (1998). The sequels featured new people, but the ghosts Casper, Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso all were present in the sequels Cathy Moriarty who played Carrigan in this movie was also in Casper meets Wendy in the movie she plays the head witch. None of the sequels are anywhere as good as this original, so don't even bother. www.lagsreviews.com

    As a child there were few movies that I enjoyed watching over and over again, but once in a while there was that one movie that just impacted me. Casper is one of those movies...the acting may not be the best and many may have taken the movie too seriously upon seeing the reviews. But the overall message and story of Casper is wonderful, and I want my children to be able to watch this someday and enjoy it as much as I certainly have. Thank you Bill Pullman for once again putting your style into such a unique and fun movie. Plus I get a kick out of the one guy with the monotone voice who was in the eye-drop commercials every time, forgive me I am too lazy to look up his name.

    Casper is a charming "family" film about a talking ghost who tries to make friends with humans, but the humans are too stupid and scared of him. Casper has three greedy uncles called Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, they like to be very rude and embarrassing towards Casper. Casper eventually manages to make friends with a young woman called Kat, but how will their friendship stay strong with three greedy ghosts in the house? The film is charming and funny with likable characters and laughably cheesy acting, it does not stop people from enjoying it, all though; it is deliberately over the top at times. If parents don't want their children to watch films with lots of screaming in, young children may need to watch it with their parents. I heard there were more Casper Films (Casper: A Spirited Beginning, Casper Meets Wendy, etc), but I can't ever remember seeing them, as I was told by other users that they were dreadful. Overall, Casper is a funny, but very silly film and it does go other the top of children's head's at times, but it is a guilty pleasure; nonetheless. 8/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    I remember watching this when I was about their age. It was one of my favorite childhood movies that I lost for many years. Casper is basically a really really sad romantic comedy for kids. Sounds like it'd be cheesy, but the comedy is distinct from the emotional bits so it's not a jumbled mess. The actors are good enough to make you give it a chance, and it just takes you from there. Casper might just be the most relatable character in film. How can't you like him? The voice actor does a fantastic job, and makes him sound like a introverted country kid without any friends. I cannot recommend it enough. 10/10

    Well, he still is. When I watched the Nostalgia Critic episode reviewing this movie, I can't believe how ungodly annoying he is. I feel like I just want to punch that flying, balding little yobbo square in the face. I mean he's so annoying he makes Spongebob Squarepants look like a normal person. But, never mind that episode, let's take a good long look at this movie. 1) The pointless cameos. Okay, don't get me wrong but Clint Eastwood, Dan Akroyd, and Ben Stein are way too talented to make cameo appearances in this moronic piece of monkey diarrhea. 2) Overuse of puns. "California Roll", "Smell-o-gram", "Closet Case", and a dozen others make no sense and aren't funny even if you TRY(emphasis on the word try) to put effort in them. 3) Casper.

When I was a kid, Casper was a kind of friendly ghost you'd know(Just like in the cartoon's theme song), but adults and animals would turn literally white and run away if they come across him and that's for laughs. Well, in this movie, maybe Casper got a little TOO friendly. Just don't expect this ghost to come back and haunt you anytime soon, that's all I could say.

    Just about every single cartoon has been turned into a feature length film. So in 1995 Universal decided to do a film of Casper. So to ask the same question as I did in my Josie And The Pussycats Review, Does it work? The film is about Dr. James Harvey played by Bill Pullman and his daughter Kat played by Christina Ricci who move into a new house in Friendship, Maine. Little do they Know that the house they moved into has a friendly ghost named Casper. The house is also being over run by SNOOTY rich girl Carrigan Crittendon played by Cathy Moriarty and her assistant Dibs played By Eric Idle who want the fortune in the house. This movie works in so many ways because I think it appeals more to adults than to kids. This is a really vulgar film filled with a ton of curse words and sexual innuendos. The film is very funny (Especially The cameo made by Dan Akroyd playing Ray From Ghostbusters)and I would pop this movie in anytime of the day. Definitely check this out. Rated PG For Mild Language And Thematic Elements. 1hr 41min/101min. ****/****

    Taking the classic comic book and cartoon onto the big screen, this version of the story of the friendly ghost gives the viewer an inside look as to who Casper really was and his life before and after becoming the sweet spirit. Fresh from her star-making role of Wednesday Addams, Christina Ricci is perfect to play the poor child who is initially scared of him but soon wants to help the spirit of the child find out the truths. Her father Bill Pullman also gets involved as do the sinister Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarty as the agent and owner of the house who hire Pullman to get rid of the spooks which includes more than just Casper. Moriarty is particularly entertaining as one of the most outrageous of greedy characters, and her shrieking (which made her the scene stealer of "Soap Dish") takes over here as well to make her unforgettably funny. There are some delightful surprises in this mostly sweet-natured tale of the tying together of two different generations of children, one live, the other dead, the greed of adults, and the Peter Pan like belief in a world beyond our grasp. Try not to feel tears of joy and nostalgia when Casper takes Ricci on the train ride to his long hidden bedroom and is later allowed to face the truth of why he is who he is. Ricci and Pullman too also face the loss of their mother and wife, although one of Casper's prankster uncle ghosts also gets in the way comically. This is a family film that proves to be innocent yet never juvenile and cloying.

    In its spookiest and most poignant moments (such as Bill Pullman being reunited with his dead wife), 'Casper' hints that it suffers from a bad case of unfulfilled potential. It's enjoyable enough, and the cartoony CG effects are pretty good despite being used to realise characters as irritating as Casper's obnoxious uncles. The problem is the lightweight treatment of what could have been a darker and more memorable kids' film: Brad Silberling's direction fails to conjure up any magic, the humour isn't that funny, and the numerous cameos are pointless (although Dan Aykroyd gets a laugh). It's all frustratingly uneven and underdeveloped, but as it's so forgettable the frustration doesn't last long.

    Childhood memories. As of recently I have been re-watching some movies I watched and liked as a kid. From what I remembered this was one of the better ones so I decided to sit down and take a look at it. The plot, it's very disjointed but I'll say it in the best way possible. A woman inherits one of her father's condemned mansions. Once she finds out it holds a treasure somewhere they look inside it only for it to be haunted by three mischievous ghosts and one friendly one. Ghost hunter after ghost hunter fails so they get a psychologist who specialises in getting ghost's unfinished business done. After that it shifts to the psychologist and his daughter talking to the ghosts, the daughter going to school, her and Casper developing a friendship. Onto the complaints as I said the plot is disjointed, some of the dialogue does get extremely weak around the middle and that it does seem a little bit more reliant on special effects than anything else. Although unlike other movies where this happens (if you want an example look at the movies playing in your theater, that's full of them) this one actually has heart (it maybe to a small extent but it does have heart). Now, if you're looking for a mindless watch that is humorous and entertaining then this could be for you - you could do with a lot worse. The three uncles are worth watching for their humour along with Eric Idle and Cathy Moriarty as the villain. I also enjoyed the soundtrack for this movie. It is very fitting and although most of the time it is the same melody it doesn't get irritating. So if you want an hour and a half of mindless entertainment of family fun then this might be the one for you. Don't expect much but it is worth watching if you have kids and they want to see something new that you might also enjoy.

    This is a perfect motion picture. It is fun, funny, and will bring tears to your eyes as it overflows with innocent romance and love. It amazes me how so much garbage that comes out of Hollywood, unwatchable garbage like "Avatar" and all those super hero movies, yet this masterpiece of writing,acting and special effects is shunned. There are many good reviews so I shall keep it short. A teen girl moves with her "ghost Psychologist" father to a haunted house to clear it out for a price. Casper lives there and is a sweet ghost and former 12 year old boy, now turned ghost. His fun and crazy three ghost "uncles" live there too and havoc ensues. The evil owner and her hilarious personal secretary (Eric Idle of Monty Python) are the real trouble makers. The friendship and romance between Ricci and "Casper" is perfect. The line that breaks my heart is when Kat (Ricci) is falling asleep and Casper cuddles up and says "Can I keep you"? It is a perfect motion picture and I watch it 5-6 times a year. Originally, the haunted house was going to be my favorite empty mansion in my home town (yes, I recommended it). Yale Univ. messed that up and the fake house they used is perfect.

    Casper is a movie that I enjoy watching over again even after 17 years this 1995 movie is very impressive, the acting and performance that both Pullman and Ricci pulled off is one that I sure admire, as both actors had to act without anything being there, as the ghosts were CGI effects added after filming, so when this two act scared and are talking, there were doing it talking to just air. The movie is interesting and likable, the plot holes are very obvious, with the whole crossing over thing, but the movie production is good enough to make you ignore the plot holes. The movie is based on a Children's book titled: The Friendly Ghost released in 1939 and an animated series done in 1945. It is directed by Brad Siberling who did a moderately good job here and who went ahead to direct City of Angels (1998) which was also not well received and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004). The movie plot starts with the antagonist Carrigan discovering that her late father willed to her an abandoned house. This made her furious cause all she wanted were his money. While disposing of the papers to the house she discovered a paper saying that there is a treasure hidden in the house. She, now ready to get the treasure goes to the house only to discover that it is being haunted by 4 ghosts, so she hired Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) to help exorcise the ghost. James moved into the house, with her daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) although James has experience dealing with ghost he has not actually seen one, so both he and his daughter were scared to bits when they moved in. They soon discovered to among the 4 ghost that there is a friendly one named Casper. With Carrigan deadline approaching James is stuck with the task of getting rid of the Ghost who seemed to be rather enjoying their haunted house. Casper was a huge commercial success bringing in way over 280 million from its 55 million production cost, but the movie didn't receive good reviews, holding a 44% approval rating from critics in rotten tomatoes. The movie's down side is the role of the antagonist Carrigan (played by Cathy Moriarty), she seemed viciously stupid, the writers made her money hungry which in turn made her throw it all away just to get a treasure box, a treasure box that she did not know what it contained. Putting it all together, this is a nice DVD to own. Casper had two sequels (that I know off) Casper: A Spirited Beginning (1997) and Casper meets Wendy (1998). The sequels featured new people, but the ghosts Casper, Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso all were present in the sequels Cathy Moriarty who played Carrigan in this movie was also in Casper meets Wendy in the movie she plays the head witch. None of the sequels are anywhere as good as this original, so don't even bother. www.lagsreviews.com

    As a child there were few movies that I enjoyed watching over and over again, but once in a while there was that one movie that just impacted me. Casper is one of those movies...the acting may not be the best and many may have taken the movie too seriously upon seeing the reviews. But the overall message and story of Casper is wonderful, and I want my children to be able to watch this someday and enjoy it as much as I certainly have. Thank you Bill Pullman for once again putting your style into such a unique and fun movie. Plus I get a kick out of the one guy with the monotone voice who was in the eye-drop commercials every time, forgive me I am too lazy to look up his name.

    Casper is a charming "family" film about a talking ghost who tries to make friends with humans, but the humans are too stupid and scared of him. Casper has three greedy uncles called Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, they like to be very rude and embarrassing towards Casper. Casper eventually manages to make friends with a young woman called Kat, but how will their friendship stay strong with three greedy ghosts in the house? The film is charming and funny with likable characters and laughably cheesy acting, it does not stop people from enjoying it, all though; it is deliberately over the top at times. If parents don't want their children to watch films with lots of screaming in, young children may need to watch it with their parents. I heard there were more Casper Films (Casper: A Spirited Beginning, Casper Meets Wendy, etc), but I can't ever remember seeing them, as I was told by other users that they were dreadful. Overall, Casper is a funny, but very silly film and it does go other the top of children's head's at times, but it is a guilty pleasure; nonetheless. 8/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    I remember watching this when I was about their age. It was one of my favorite childhood movies that I lost for many years. Casper is basically a really really sad romantic comedy for kids. Sounds like it'd be cheesy, but the comedy is distinct from the emotional bits so it's not a jumbled mess. The actors are good enough to make you give it a chance, and it just takes you from there. Casper might just be the most relatable character in film. How can't you like him? The voice actor does a fantastic job, and makes him sound like a introverted country kid without any friends. I cannot recommend it enough. 10/10

    Well, he still is. When I watched the Nostalgia Critic episode reviewing this movie, I can't believe how ungodly annoying he is. I feel like I just want to punch that flying, balding little yobbo square in the face. I mean he's so annoying he makes Spongebob Squarepants look like a normal person. But, never mind that episode, let's take a good long look at this movie. 1) The pointless cameos. Okay, don't get me wrong but Clint Eastwood, Dan Akroyd, and Ben Stein are way too talented to make cameo appearances in this moronic piece of monkey diarrhea. 2) Overuse of puns. "California Roll", "Smell-o-gram", "Closet Case", and a dozen others make no sense and aren't funny even if you TRY(emphasis on the word try) to put effort in them. 3) Casper.

When I was a kid, Casper was a kind of friendly ghost you'd know(Just like in the cartoon's theme song), but adults and animals would turn literally white and run away if they come across him and that's for laughs. Well, in this movie, maybe Casper got a little TOO friendly. Just don't expect this ghost to come back and haunt you anytime soon, that's all I could say.

    Just about every single cartoon has been turned into a feature length film. So in 1995 Universal decided to do a film of Casper. So to ask the same question as I did in my Josie And The Pussycats Review, Does it work? The film is about Dr. James Harvey played by Bill Pullman and his daughter Kat played by Christina Ricci who move into a new house in Friendship, Maine. Little do they Know that the house they moved into has a friendly ghost named Casper. The house is also being over run by SNOOTY rich girl Carrigan Crittendon played by Cathy Moriarty and her assistant Dibs played By Eric Idle who want the fortune in the house. This movie works in so many ways because I think it appeals more to adults than to kids. This is a really vulgar film filled with a ton of curse words and sexual innuendos. The film is very funny (Especially The cameo made by Dan Akroyd playing Ray From Ghostbusters)and I would pop this movie in anytime of the day. Definitely check this out. Rated PG For Mild Language And Thematic Elements. 1hr 41min/101min. ****/****
