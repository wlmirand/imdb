 <sinopse>
  The claustrophobic world of a WWII German U-boat; boredom, filth, and sheer terror.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  It is 1942 and the German submarine fleet is heavily engaged in the so called "Battle of the Atlantic" to harass and destroy British shipping. With better escorts of the Destroyer Class, however, German U-Boats have begun to take heavy losses. "Das Boot" is the story of one such U-Boat crew, with the film examining how these submariners maintained their professionalism as soldiers, attempted to accomplish impossible missions, while all the time attempting to understand and obey the ideology of the government under which they served.

    Where do I start, I can't fault this film really. One of my favourite War films ever. For those who don't know what this film is about.The Film focuses on a U-96, a German U-boat and it's crew during WWII. It shows the excitement of battle for the crew, the claustrophobic, cramped conditions of a U- Boat and the fear of being hunted. One of the best things about this film, is that it avoids stereotypes and instead shows the U-Boat crew as ordinary people fighting for Germany. Everything in the Film is spot on! The story, acting, dialogue, sound, special effects, directing and especially the soundtrack. The chilling soundtrack fits the mood of the film perfectly. One of the best soundtracks ever. Even though the film is long (Director's Cut is 3 hours and 20 minutes) there isn't a single boring bit, the whole film is exciting through out. Das Boot is the ultimate Submarine film, it torpedoes U-571 hands down. In short Das Boot is a chilling, fantastic, epic war film. Gives me goose bumps every time I watch it. Don't miss this film, you will not be disappointed, worth every minute. I love it.

    Das boot is a movie that will nail you and that's why you are going to love it. It's a movie that you will feel the emotions of the crew and especially of the captain (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow). In some moments you will feel that you are also a member of this crew and you are going to feel how it feels to be a member of this crew and what are the difficulties they experience in their "journey". I liked this movie very much because of interpretations of actors and how they interpreted their roles. It's a movie that in some moments maybe it is slow but this is the meaning, in a submarine time passes very slowly and it was still something that this film wanted to show us and make us feel it. I recommend it and I want to tell you that this movie it is not a simple movie with a submarine and its "journey" (war), it is more than that. So if you want to know more for this movie you have to see it.

    how can someone not give this a perfect 10, first off this is the only authentic submarine movie ever made. yeah I liked u-571, but this is way more realistic,, I love all of the German U-boats running around in the water. i'm German so I have a love of all things German, Juergen pruchnow deserves 2 Oscars for his performance,, his best acting to date as far as i'm concerned,, Das Boot is a journey into madness, to see all of the men's heart's breaking with each "ping" , I love all of the camera angels used, where you get up close and personal feeling of being right there in the little U-boat.. the War terminology was realistic,, all of the sea lanes and plotting,, navigation tools.. even the rare parts of the movie that are not filmed in or around water were very good,, if you can get the director's cut,, the special features are a must watch.. I would recommend to any film buff that this is one movie that you must watch,, because of how riveting and bold this is,, also very sad and you feel for all involves,, I also felt very bad for the German captain

    Brilliantly told story about boredom and the utter fear inside a German u- boat during the second world war. Wolfgang Petersen really managers to get you to feel about the soldiers and sesame inside the u-boat with shots that make it feel as if you are inside the submarine being blown to bits. The acting is top notch with J&uuml;rgen Prochnow as the hard but experienced and determined captain putting in a brilliant performance. The story holds you enthralled throughout its 3 hours as you delve deep into the characters and their terrifying experiences of war. The effects are still believable while the actual story is about the characters and their war.

    I knew how much many people have absolutely hated the ways of the Germans during WWII. But you know, sometimes, their stories can be interesting to learn. And this is one of those cases. "Das Boot" is a perfectly marvelous film. I admit, I myself, am a fan of Wolfgang Petersen's work, and I've gotta say, that "Das Boot" is his best work so far. I've been kinda disappointed with his latest works, such as "Poseidon" or "Outbreak." But though, I still think he is an amazing director. Petersen has done the movie I have wanted to see for a long time. "Das Boot" is one of the best war movies I have ever seen in my life. "Das Boot" is just so excellently made. The editing is just amazing, and the acting is perfectly suited for the movie. In a way, the camera shots really impressed me. But you know, I still can't really complain about Petersen's directing style. So to conclude, "Das Boot" is an excellent movie. You must watch it.

    Although German film-making during the eighties was focused a lot on epic television mini- series ("Berlin Alexanderplatz", the "Heimat" trilogy) it gave light to a few modern classics of world cinema as well; one of them includes "Das Boot", most definitely the best, most accomplished piece of work by director Wolfgang Petersen, who was a solid and promising figure amongst German film-makers at the time, meaning right after the rise of the great New German Cinema directors such as Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, or Rainer Winder Fassbinder. Unfortunately, after "Das Boot" Petersen hasn't received no way near the same amount of praise for his work, although he's made several commercially successful films in Hollywood such as "Troy", "The Perfect Storm" or "Poseidon". Based on the novel by Luthar G. Buchhein, "Das Boot" narrates the misadventures of a WWII German submarine, the U-96: the film shows in excruciating detail how it's like to live in such a claustrophobic little world, where anxiety is on the back of everyone's minds, while at the same time they experience mind-numbing boredom and are exposed to very poor hygiene. Their final target is to hunt for English destroyers and submarines, but very soon they find themselves to be at a great disadvantage. Marvelously directed by Wolfgang Petersen and shot by Jost Vacano, the camera movement heightens the sense of claustrophobia, as it quickly passes through the extremely narrow corridors of the submarine, lighted mostly by the dim lights of the submarine, which change color according to how much precaution the crew must undertake (either red or blue), thus giving an even more thrilling element to the film's tense moments. Klaus Doldinger's synth- based score gives the perfect touch to these moments, in a similar fashion of 70's electronic bands coming out of Germany such as Tangerine Dream. Despite this being an over three-hour movie, there's nothing epic about it: the time lapse between the beginning and the end is relatively small, and the setting remains pretty much the same throughout the entire film. Yet, there's not one dull moment to be found, because it becomes so easy to enter into the skin of the soldiers on board. When they're being attacked, or worse, the tension is triple the amount of the one of an average thriller, because there's that feeling of experiencing the movie rather than watching it, making the audience much more involved in the story. This is a very rare trait in cinema today, so when you do see a movie as gripping as "Das Boot", It's something to be recognized, and not modestly.

    Very long (I watched the 3 1/2 hour version of this) with some boring batches, some exciting patches, and some very intense patches (just like submarine life I suppose) Das Boot woke everyone up to the filmmaking skills of Wolfgang Petersen. I had known about this film for years, but never did get around to seeing it. But I finally did. It took about a week or so to watch it mind you, a little bit here, a little bit there. It definitely got better as we went along. I would recommend though, the shorter version first if you haven't seen this, and even if you just DID see the shorter version, unless you've GOT to see this, I think you'll be fine.

    It isn't. It simply isn't. And that is what makes it such a masterpiece. Halfway through the film you forget that the characters are German sailors, you forget about the Nazi ideology, you forget that the story is set in 1941 or even set on planet Earth. Wolfgang Petersen takes you to an alternate dimension, far away from anything we consider human, where there is no right or wrong and your only option is to kill or be killed. And the sensation of death draws ever closer, its certainty slowly driving every single man to insanity. The film is as much a world war 2 movie as "Apocalypse Now" is a movie about Vietnam. It's a psychological ride that makes you think about the nature of humanity and war in general. It's a long movie so get ready and submerge into an painful, terrifying nightmare.

    I saw this film in a theater when it was a recent release, 1982. Was so impressed by the realism that afterward I wrote to a friend: "It makes Star Wars look like a Porky Pig cartoon!" But seriously, the U-boats were a major danger to allied shipping, and American and British sailors cursed at them. Das Boot shows the German side of the story with the crewmen cursing in German (with English subtitles) at the destroyers overhead. The German sailors were shown as regular people bravely doing their best in very difficult situations, not as mindless, fanatical Nazis like a cheesy American film might portray them. The cinematography was excellent, really made me feel like was in sub with them. Thankfully it wasn't in smellovision.

    This film authentically presented the heroics ,bravery and hardships of the German sailors of the Kreiegsrine during the Battle of the Atlantic . The U-Boots of the Kreigsmarine were in tight groups called "Wolf Packs". And their signatures role was to sink Allied supply convoys these submarines were nightmares for enemy merchant ships.Among these submarines were young sailors brave and heroic men these were some were famous commanders such as Otto Kretschmer or Heinrich -Lehmann Willenbrock (who was actually a consultant for this motion picture )others were regular sailors this film chronicles their story . The sets ,the actors and performances were at their utmost authenticity and I personally think that 21st century movies should be more like the hearty,classical movies of the 20th century .

In some moments you will feel that you are also a member of this crew and you are going to feel how it feels to be a member of this crew and what are the difficulties they experience in their "journey".

It's a movie that in some moments maybe it is slow but this is the meaning, in a submarine time passes very slowly and it was still something that this film wanted to show us and make us feel it. I recommend it and I want to tell you that this movie it is not a simple movie with a submarine and its "journey" (war), it is more than that. So if you want to know more for this movie you have to see it.

    how can someone not give this a perfect 10, first off this is the only authentic submarine movie ever made. yeah I liked u-571, but this is way more realistic,, I love all of the German U-boats running around in the water. i'm German so I have a love of all things German, Juergen pruchnow deserves 2 Oscars for his performance,, his best acting to date as far as i'm concerned,, Das Boot is a journey into madness, to see all of the men's heart's breaking with each "ping" , I love all of the camera angels used, where you get up close and personal feeling of being right there in the little U-boat.. the War terminology was realistic,, all of the sea lanes and plotting,, navigation tools.. even the rare parts of the movie that are not filmed in or around water were very good,, if you can get the director's cut,, the special features are a must watch.. I would recommend to any film buff that this is one movie that you must watch,, because of how riveting and bold this is,, also very sad and you feel for all involves,, I also felt very bad for the German captain

    Brilliantly told story about boredom and the utter fear inside a German u- boat during the second world war. Wolfgang Petersen really managers to get you to feel about the soldiers and sesame inside the u-boat with shots that make it feel as if you are inside the submarine being blown to bits. The acting is top notch with J&uuml;rgen Prochnow as the hard but experienced and determined captain putting in a brilliant performance. The story holds you enthralled throughout its 3 hours as you delve deep into the characters and their terrifying experiences of war. The effects are still believable while the actual story is about the characters and their war.

    I knew how much many people have absolutely hated the ways of the Germans during WWII. But you know, sometimes, their stories can be interesting to learn. And this is one of those cases. "Das Boot" is a perfectly marvelous film. I admit, I myself, am a fan of Wolfgang Petersen's work, and I've gotta say, that "Das Boot" is his best work so far. I've been kinda disappointed with his latest works, such as "Poseidon" or "Outbreak." But though, I still think he is an amazing director. Petersen has done the movie I have wanted to see for a long time. "Das Boot" is one of the best war movies I have ever seen in my life. "Das Boot" is just so excellently made. The editing is just amazing, and the acting is perfectly suited for the movie. In a way, the camera shots really impressed me. But you know, I still can't really complain about Petersen's directing style. So to conclude, "Das Boot" is an excellent movie. You must watch it.

    Although German film-making during the eighties was focused a lot on epic television mini- series ("Berlin Alexanderplatz", the "Heimat" trilogy) it gave light to a few modern classics of world cinema as well; one of them includes "Das Boot", most definitely the best, most accomplished piece of work by director Wolfgang Petersen, who was a solid and promising figure amongst German film-makers at the time, meaning right after the rise of the great New German Cinema directors such as Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, or Rainer Winder Fassbinder. Unfortunately, after "Das Boot" Petersen hasn't received no way near the same amount of praise for his work, although he's made several commercially successful films in Hollywood such as "Troy", "The Perfect Storm" or "Poseidon". Based on the novel by Luthar G. Buchhein, "Das Boot" narrates the misadventures of a WWII German submarine, the U-96: the film shows in excruciating detail how it's like to live in such a claustrophobic little world, where anxiety is on the back of everyone's minds, while at the same time they experience mind-numbing boredom and are exposed to very poor hygiene. Their final target is to hunt for English destroyers and submarines, but very soon they find themselves to be at a great disadvantage. Marvelously directed by Wolfgang Petersen and shot by Jost Vacano, the camera movement heightens the sense of claustrophobia, as it quickly passes through the extremely narrow corridors of the submarine, lighted mostly by the dim lights of the submarine, which change color according to how much precaution the crew must undertake (either red or blue), thus giving an even more thrilling element to the film's tense moments. Klaus Doldinger's synth- based score gives the perfect touch to these moments, in a similar fashion of 70's electronic bands coming out of Germany such as Tangerine Dream. Despite this being an over three-hour movie, there's nothing epic about it: the time lapse between the beginning and the end is relatively small, and the setting remains pretty much the same throughout the entire film. Yet, there's not one dull moment to be found, because it becomes so easy to enter into the skin of the soldiers on board. When they're being attacked, or worse, the tension is triple the amount of the one of an average thriller, because there's that feeling of experiencing the movie rather than watching it, making the audience much more involved in the story. This is a very rare trait in cinema today, so when you do see a movie as gripping as "Das Boot", It's something to be recognized, and not modestly.

    Very long (I watched the 3 1/2 hour version of this) with some boring batches, some exciting patches, and some very intense patches (just like submarine life I suppose) Das Boot woke everyone up to the filmmaking skills of Wolfgang Petersen. I had known about this film for years, but never did get around to seeing it. But I finally did. It took about a week or so to watch it mind you, a little bit here, a little bit there. It definitely got better as we went along. I would recommend though, the shorter version first if you haven't seen this, and even if you just DID see the shorter version, unless you've GOT to see this, I think you'll be fine.

    It isn't. It simply isn't. And that is what makes it such a masterpiece. Halfway through the film you forget that the characters are German sailors, you forget about the Nazi ideology, you forget that the story is set in 1941 or even set on planet Earth. Wolfgang Petersen takes you to an alternate dimension, far away from anything we consider human, where there is no right or wrong and your only option is to kill or be killed. And the sensation of death draws ever closer, its certainty slowly driving every single man to insanity. The film is as much a world war 2 movie as "Apocalypse Now" is a movie about Vietnam. It's a psychological ride that makes you think about the nature of humanity and war in general. It's a long movie so get ready and submerge into an painful, terrifying nightmare.

    I saw this film in a theater when it was a recent release, 1982. Was so impressed by the realism that afterward I wrote to a friend: "It makes Star Wars look like a Porky Pig cartoon!" But seriously, the U-boats were a major danger to allied shipping, and American and British sailors cursed at them. Das Boot shows the German side of the story with the crewmen cursing in German (with English subtitles) at the destroyers overhead. The German sailors were shown as regular people bravely doing their best in very difficult situations, not as mindless, fanatical Nazis like a cheesy American film might portray them. The cinematography was excellent, really made me feel like was in sub with them. Thankfully it wasn't in smellovision.

    This film authentically presented the heroics ,bravery and hardships of the German sailors of the Kreiegsrine during the Battle of the Atlantic . The U-Boots of the Kreigsmarine were in tight groups called "Wolf Packs". And their signatures role was to sink Allied supply convoys these submarines were nightmares for enemy merchant ships.Among these submarines were young sailors brave and heroic men these were some were famous commanders such as Otto Kretschmer or Heinrich -Lehmann Willenbrock (who was actually a consultant for this motion picture )others were regular sailors this film chronicles their story . The sets ,the actors and performances were at their utmost authenticity and I personally think that 21st century movies should be more like the hearty,classical movies of the 20th century .

    Where do I start, I can't fault this film really. One of my favourite War films ever. For those who don't know what this film is about.The Film focuses on a U-96, a German U-boat and it's crew during WWII. It shows the excitement of battle for the crew, the claustrophobic, cramped conditions of a U- Boat and the fear of being hunted. One of the best things about this film, is that it avoids stereotypes and instead shows the U-Boat crew as ordinary people fighting for Germany. Everything in the Film is spot on! The story, acting, dialogue, sound, special effects, directing and especially the soundtrack. The chilling soundtrack fits the mood of the film perfectly. One of the best soundtracks ever. Even though the film is long (Director's Cut is 3 hours and 20 minutes) there isn't a single boring bit, the whole film is exciting through out. Das Boot is the ultimate Submarine film, it torpedoes U-571 hands down. In short Das Boot is a chilling, fantastic, epic war film. Gives me goose bumps every time I watch it. Don't miss this film, you will not be disappointed, worth every minute. I love it.

    Das boot is a movie that will nail you and that's why you are going to love it. It's a movie that you will feel the emotions of the crew and especially of the captain (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow). In some moments you will feel that you are also a member of this crew and you are going to feel how it feels to be a member of this crew and what are the difficulties they experience in their "journey". I liked this movie very much because of interpretations of actors and how they interpreted their roles. It's a movie that in some moments maybe it is slow but this is the meaning, in a submarine time passes very slowly and it was still something that this film wanted to show us and make us feel it. I recommend it and I want to tell you that this movie it is not a simple movie with a submarine and its "journey" (war), it is more than that. So if you want to know more for this movie you have to see it.

Buchhein, "Das Boot" narrates the misadventures of a WWII German submarine, the U-96: the film shows in excruciating detail how it's like to live in such a claustrophobic little world, where anxiety is on the back of everyone's minds, while at the same time they experience mind-numbing boredom and are exposed to very poor hygiene. Their final target is to hunt for English destroyers and submarines, but very soon they find themselves to be at a great disadvantage. Marvelously directed by Wolfgang Petersen and shot by Jost Vacano, the camera movement heightens the sense of claustrophobia, as it quickly passes through the extremely narrow corridors of the submarine, lighted mostly by the dim lights of the submarine, which change color according to how much precaution the crew must undertake (either red or blue), thus giving an even more thrilling element to the film's tense moments. Klaus Doldinger's synth- based score gives the perfect touch to these moments, in a similar fashion of 70's electronic bands coming out of Germany such as Tangerine Dream. Despite this being an over three-hour movie, there's nothing epic about it: the time lapse between the beginning and the end is relatively small, and the setting remains pretty much the same throughout the entire film. Yet, there's not one dull moment to be found, because it becomes so easy to enter into the skin of the soldiers on board. When they're being attacked, or worse, the tension is triple the amount of the one of an average thriller, because there's that feeling of experiencing the movie rather than watching it, making the audience much more involved in the story. This is a very rare trait in cinema today, so when you do see a movie as gripping as "Das Boot", It's something to be recognized, and not modestly.

    Very long (I watched the 3 1/2 hour version of this) with some boring batches, some exciting patches, and some very intense patches (just like submarine life I suppose) Das Boot woke everyone up to the filmmaking skills of Wolfgang Petersen. I had known about this film for years, but never did get around to seeing it. But I finally did. It took about a week or so to watch it mind you, a little bit here, a little bit there. It definitely got better as we went along. I would recommend though, the shorter version first if you haven't seen this, and even if you just DID see the shorter version, unless you've GOT to see this, I think you'll be fine.

    It isn't. It simply isn't. And that is what makes it such a masterpiece. Halfway through the film you forget that the characters are German sailors, you forget about the Nazi ideology, you forget that the story is set in 1941 or even set on planet Earth. Wolfgang Petersen takes you to an alternate dimension, far away from anything we consider human, where there is no right or wrong and your only option is to kill or be killed. And the sensation of death draws ever closer, its certainty slowly driving every single man to insanity. The film is as much a world war 2 movie as "Apocalypse Now" is a movie about Vietnam. It's a psychological ride that makes you think about the nature of humanity and war in general. It's a long movie so get ready and submerge into an painful, terrifying nightmare.

    I saw this film in a theater when it was a recent release, 1982. Was so impressed by the realism that afterward I wrote to a friend: "It makes Star Wars look like a Porky Pig cartoon!" But seriously, the U-boats were a major danger to allied shipping, and American and British sailors cursed at them. Das Boot shows the German side of the story with the crewmen cursing in German (with English subtitles) at the destroyers overhead. The German sailors were shown as regular people bravely doing their best in very difficult situations, not as mindless, fanatical Nazis like a cheesy American film might portray them. The cinematography was excellent, really made me feel like was in sub with them. Thankfully it wasn't in smellovision.

    This film authentically presented the heroics ,bravery and hardships of the German sailors of the Kreiegsrine during the Battle of the Atlantic . The U-Boots of the Kreigsmarine were in tight groups called "Wolf Packs". And their signatures role was to sink Allied supply convoys these submarines were nightmares for enemy merchant ships.Among these submarines were young sailors brave and heroic men these were some were famous commanders such as Otto Kretschmer or Heinrich -Lehmann Willenbrock (who was actually a consultant for this motion picture )others were regular sailors this film chronicles their story . The sets ,the actors and performances were at their utmost authenticity and I personally think that 21st century movies should be more like the hearty,classical movies of the 20th century .

    Where do I start, I can't fault this film really. One of my favourite War films ever. For those who don't know what this film is about.The Film focuses on a U-96, a German U-boat and it's crew during WWII. It shows the excitement of battle for the crew, the claustrophobic, cramped conditions of a U- Boat and the fear of being hunted. One of the best things about this film, is that it avoids stereotypes and instead shows the U-Boat crew as ordinary people fighting for Germany. Everything in the Film is spot on! The story, acting, dialogue, sound, special effects, directing and especially the soundtrack. The chilling soundtrack fits the mood of the film perfectly. One of the best soundtracks ever. Even though the film is long (Director's Cut is 3 hours and 20 minutes) there isn't a single boring bit, the whole film is exciting through out. Das Boot is the ultimate Submarine film, it torpedoes U-571 hands down. In short Das Boot is a chilling, fantastic, epic war film. Gives me goose bumps every time I watch it. Don't miss this film, you will not be disappointed, worth every minute. I love it.

    Das boot is a movie that will nail you and that's why you are going to love it. It's a movie that you will feel the emotions of the crew and especially of the captain (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow). In some moments you will feel that you are also a member of this crew and you are going to feel how it feels to be a member of this crew and what are the difficulties they experience in their "journey". I liked this movie very much because of interpretations of actors and how they interpreted their roles. It's a movie that in some moments maybe it is slow but this is the meaning, in a submarine time passes very slowly and it was still something that this film wanted to show us and make us feel it. I recommend it and I want to tell you that this movie it is not a simple movie with a submarine and its "journey" (war), it is more than that. So if you want to know more for this movie you have to see it.

    how can someone not give this a perfect 10, first off this is the only authentic submarine movie ever made. yeah I liked u-571, but this is way more realistic,, I love all of the German U-boats running around in the water. i'm German so I have a love of all things German, Juergen pruchnow deserves 2 Oscars for his performance,, his best acting to date as far as i'm concerned,, Das Boot is a journey into madness, to see all of the men's heart's breaking with each "ping" , I love all of the camera angels used, where you get up close and personal feeling of being right there in the little U-boat.. the War terminology was realistic,, all of the sea lanes and plotting,, navigation tools.. even the rare parts of the movie that are not filmed in or around water were very good,, if you can get the director's cut,, the special features are a must watch.. I would recommend to any film buff that this is one movie that you must watch,, because of how riveting and bold this is,, also very sad and you feel for all involves,, I also felt very bad for the German captain

    Brilliantly told story about boredom and the utter fear inside a German u- boat during the second world war. Wolfgang Petersen really managers to get you to feel about the soldiers and sesame inside the u-boat with shots that make it feel as if you are inside the submarine being blown to bits. The acting is top notch with J&uuml;rgen Prochnow as the hard but experienced and determined captain putting in a brilliant performance. The story holds you enthralled throughout its 3 hours as you delve deep into the characters and their terrifying experiences of war. The effects are still believable while the actual story is about the characters and their war.

    I knew how much many people have absolutely hated the ways of the Germans during WWII. But you know, sometimes, their stories can be interesting to learn. And this is one of those cases. "Das Boot" is a perfectly marvelous film. I admit, I myself, am a fan of Wolfgang Petersen's work, and I've gotta say, that "Das Boot" is his best work so far. I've been kinda disappointed with his latest works, such as "Poseidon" or "Outbreak." But though, I still think he is an amazing director. Petersen has done the movie I have wanted to see for a long time. "Das Boot" is one of the best war movies I have ever seen in my life. "Das Boot" is just so excellently made. The editing is just amazing, and the acting is perfectly suited for the movie. In a way, the camera shots really impressed me. But you know, I still can't really complain about Petersen's directing style. So to conclude, "Das Boot" is an excellent movie. You must watch it.

    Although German film-making during the eighties was focused a lot on epic television mini- series ("Berlin Alexanderplatz", the "Heimat" trilogy) it gave light to a few modern classics of world cinema as well; one of them includes "Das Boot", most definitely the best, most accomplished piece of work by director Wolfgang Petersen, who was a solid and promising figure amongst German film-makers at the time, meaning right after the rise of the great New German Cinema directors such as Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, or Rainer Winder Fassbinder. Unfortunately, after "Das Boot" Petersen hasn't received no way near the same amount of praise for his work, although he's made several commercially successful films in Hollywood such as "Troy", "The Perfect Storm" or "Poseidon".

    This film authentically presented the heroics ,bravery and hardships of the German sailors of the Kreiegsrine during the Battle of the Atlantic . The U-Boots of the Kreigsmarine were in tight groups called "Wolf Packs". And their signatures role was to sink Allied supply convoys these submarines were nightmares for enemy merchant ships.Among these submarines were young sailors brave and heroic men these were some were famous commanders such as Otto Kretschmer or Heinrich -Lehmann Willenbrock (who was actually a consultant for this motion picture )others were regular sailors this film chronicles their story . The sets ,the actors and performances were at their utmost authenticity and I personally think that 21st century movies should be more like the hearty,classical movies of the 20th century .

    Where do I start, I can't fault this film really. One of my favourite War films ever. For those who don't know what this film is about.The Film focuses on a U-96, a German U-boat and it's crew during WWII. It shows the excitement of battle for the crew, the claustrophobic, cramped conditions of a U- Boat and the fear of being hunted. One of the best things about this film, is that it avoids stereotypes and instead shows the U-Boat crew as ordinary people fighting for Germany. Everything in the Film is spot on! The story, acting, dialogue, sound, special effects, directing and especially the soundtrack. The chilling soundtrack fits the mood of the film perfectly. One of the best soundtracks ever. Even though the film is long (Director's Cut is 3 hours and 20 minutes) there isn't a single boring bit, the whole film is exciting through out. Das Boot is the ultimate Submarine film, it torpedoes U-571 hands down. In short Das Boot is a chilling, fantastic, epic war film. Gives me goose bumps every time I watch it. Don't miss this film, you will not be disappointed, worth every minute. I love it.

    Das boot is a movie that will nail you and that's why you are going to love it. It's a movie that you will feel the emotions of the crew and especially of the captain (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow). In some moments you will feel that you are also a member of this crew and you are going to feel how it feels to be a member of this crew and what are the difficulties they experience in their "journey". I liked this movie very much because of interpretations of actors and how they interpreted their roles. It's a movie that in some moments maybe it is slow but this is the meaning, in a submarine time passes very slowly and it was still something that this film wanted to show us and make us feel it. I recommend it and I want to tell you that this movie it is not a simple movie with a submarine and its "journey" (war), it is more than that. So if you want to know more for this movie you have to see it.

    how can someone not give this a perfect 10, first off this is the only authentic submarine movie ever made. yeah I liked u-571, but this is way more realistic,, I love all of the German U-boats running around in the water. i'm German so I have a love of all things German, Juergen pruchnow deserves 2 Oscars for his performance,, his best acting to date as far as i'm concerned,, Das Boot is a journey into madness, to see all of the men's heart's breaking with each "ping" , I love all of the camera angels used, where you get up close and personal feeling of being right there in the little U-boat.. the War terminology was realistic,, all of the sea lanes and plotting,, navigation tools.. even the rare parts of the movie that are not filmed in or around water were very good,, if you can get the director's cut,, the special features are a must watch.. I would recommend to any film buff that this is one movie that you must watch,, because of how riveting and bold this is,, also very sad and you feel for all involves,, I also felt very bad for the German captain

    Brilliantly told story about boredom and the utter fear inside a German u- boat during the second world war. Wolfgang Petersen really managers to get you to feel about the soldiers and sesame inside the u-boat with shots that make it feel as if you are inside the submarine being blown to bits. The acting is top notch with J&uuml;rgen Prochnow as the hard but experienced and determined captain putting in a brilliant performance. The story holds you enthralled throughout its 3 hours as you delve deep into the characters and their terrifying experiences of war. The effects are still believable while the actual story is about the characters and their war.

    I knew how much many people have absolutely hated the ways of the Germans during WWII. But you know, sometimes, their stories can be interesting to learn. And this is one of those cases. "Das Boot" is a perfectly marvelous film. I admit, I myself, am a fan of Wolfgang Petersen's work, and I've gotta say, that "Das Boot" is his best work so far. I've been kinda disappointed with his latest works, such as "Poseidon" or "Outbreak." But though, I still think he is an amazing director. Petersen has done the movie I have wanted to see for a long time. "Das Boot" is one of the best war movies I have ever seen in my life. "Das Boot" is just so excellently made. The editing is just amazing, and the acting is perfectly suited for the movie. In a way, the camera shots really impressed me. But you know, I still can't really complain about Petersen's directing style. So to conclude, "Das Boot" is an excellent movie. You must watch it.

    Although German film-making during the eighties was focused a lot on epic television mini- series ("Berlin Alexanderplatz", the "Heimat" trilogy) it gave light to a few modern classics of world cinema as well; one of them includes "Das Boot", most definitely the best, most accomplished piece of work by director Wolfgang Petersen, who was a solid and promising figure amongst German film-makers at the time, meaning right after the rise of the great New German Cinema directors such as Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, or Rainer Winder Fassbinder. Unfortunately, after "Das Boot" Petersen hasn't received no way near the same amount of praise for his work, although he's made several commercially successful films in Hollywood such as "Troy", "The Perfect Storm" or "Poseidon". Based on the novel by Luthar G. Buchhein, "Das Boot" narrates the misadventures of a WWII German submarine, the U-96: the film shows in excruciating detail how it's like to live in such a claustrophobic little world, where anxiety is on the back of everyone's minds, while at the same time they experience mind-numbing boredom and are exposed to very poor hygiene. Their final target is to hunt for English destroyers and submarines, but very soon they find themselves to be at a great disadvantage. Marvelously directed by Wolfgang Petersen and shot by Jost Vacano, the camera movement heightens the sense of claustrophobia, as it quickly passes through the extremely narrow corridors of the submarine, lighted mostly by the dim lights of the submarine, which change color according to how much precaution the crew must undertake (either red or blue), thus giving an even more thrilling element to the film's tense moments. Klaus Doldinger's synth- based score gives the perfect touch to these moments, in a similar fashion of 70's electronic bands coming out of Germany such as Tangerine Dream. Despite this being an over three-hour movie, there's nothing epic about it: the time lapse between the beginning and the end is relatively small, and the setting remains pretty much the same throughout the entire film. Yet, there's not one dull moment to be found, because it becomes so easy to enter into the skin of the soldiers on board. When they're being attacked, or worse, the tension is triple the amount of the one of an average thriller, because there's that feeling of experiencing the movie rather than watching it, making the audience much more involved in the story. This is a very rare trait in cinema today, so when you do see a movie as gripping as "Das Boot", It's something to be recognized, and not modestly.

    Very long (I watched the 3 1/2 hour version of this) with some boring batches, some exciting patches, and some very intense patches (just like submarine life I suppose) Das Boot woke everyone up to the filmmaking skills of Wolfgang Petersen. I had known about this film for years, but never did get around to seeing it. But I finally did. It took about a week or so to watch it mind you, a little bit here, a little bit there. It definitely got better as we went along. I would recommend though, the shorter version first if you haven't seen this, and even if you just DID see the shorter version, unless you've GOT to see this, I think you'll be fine.

    It isn't. It simply isn't. And that is what makes it such a masterpiece. Halfway through the film you forget that the characters are German sailors, you forget about the Nazi ideology, you forget that the story is set in 1941 or even set on planet Earth. Wolfgang Petersen takes you to an alternate dimension, far away from anything we consider human, where there is no right or wrong and your only option is to kill or be killed. And the sensation of death draws ever closer, its certainty slowly driving every single man to insanity. The film is as much a world war 2 movie as "Apocalypse Now" is a movie about Vietnam. It's a psychological ride that makes you think about the nature of humanity and war in general. It's a long movie so get ready and submerge into an painful, terrifying nightmare.

    I saw this film in a theater when it was a recent release, 1982. Was so impressed by the realism that afterward I wrote to a friend: "It makes Star Wars look like a Porky Pig cartoon!" But seriously, the U-boats were a major danger to allied shipping, and American and British sailors cursed at them. Das Boot shows the German side of the story with the crewmen cursing in German (with English subtitles) at the destroyers overhead. The German sailors were shown as regular people bravely doing their best in very difficult situations, not as mindless, fanatical Nazis like a cheesy American film might portray them. The cinematography was excellent, really made me feel like was in sub with them. Thankfully it wasn't in smellovision.

I would recommend to any film buff that this is one movie that you must watch,, because of how riveting and bold this is,, also very sad and you feel for all involves,, I also felt very bad for the German captain

    Brilliantly told story about boredom and the utter fear inside a German u- boat during the second world war. Wolfgang Petersen really managers to get you to feel about the soldiers and sesame inside the u-boat with shots that make it feel as if you are inside the submarine being blown to bits. The acting is top notch with J&uuml;rgen Prochnow as the hard but experienced and determined captain putting in a brilliant performance. The story holds you enthralled throughout its 3 hours as you delve deep into the characters and their terrifying experiences of war. The effects are still believable while the actual story is about the characters and their war.

    I knew how much many people have absolutely hated the ways of the Germans during WWII. But you know, sometimes, their stories can be interesting to learn. And this is one of those cases. "Das Boot" is a perfectly marvelous film. I admit, I myself, am a fan of Wolfgang Petersen's work, and I've gotta say, that "Das Boot" is his best work so far. I've been kinda disappointed with his latest works, such as "Poseidon" or "Outbreak." But though, I still think he is an amazing director. Petersen has done the movie I have wanted to see for a long time. "Das Boot" is one of the best war movies I have ever seen in my life. "Das Boot" is just so excellently made. The editing is just amazing, and the acting is perfectly suited for the movie. In a way, the camera shots really impressed me. But you know, I still can't really complain about Petersen's directing style. So to conclude, "Das Boot" is an excellent movie. You must watch it.

    Although German film-making during the eighties was focused a lot on epic television mini- series ("Berlin Alexanderplatz", the "Heimat" trilogy) it gave light to a few modern classics of world cinema as well; one of them includes "Das Boot", most definitely the best, most accomplished piece of work by director Wolfgang Petersen, who was a solid and promising figure amongst German film-makers at the time, meaning right after the rise of the great New German Cinema directors such as Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, or Rainer Winder Fassbinder. Unfortunately, after "Das Boot" Petersen hasn't received no way near the same amount of praise for his work, although he's made several commercially successful films in Hollywood such as "Troy", "The Perfect Storm" or "Poseidon". Based on the novel by Luthar G. Buchhein, "Das Boot" narrates the misadventures of a WWII German submarine, the U-96: the film shows in excruciating detail how it's like to live in such a claustrophobic little world, where anxiety is on the back of everyone's minds, while at the same time they experience mind-numbing boredom and are exposed to very poor hygiene. Their final target is to hunt for English destroyers and submarines, but very soon they find themselves to be at a great disadvantage. Marvelously directed by Wolfgang Petersen and shot by Jost Vacano, the camera movement heightens the sense of claustrophobia, as it quickly passes through the extremely narrow corridors of the submarine, lighted mostly by the dim lights of the submarine, which change color according to how much precaution the crew must undertake (either red or blue), thus giving an even more thrilling element to the film's tense moments. Klaus Doldinger's synth- based score gives the perfect touch to these moments, in a similar fashion of 70's electronic bands coming out of Germany such as Tangerine Dream. Despite this being an over three-hour movie, there's nothing epic about it: the time lapse between the beginning and the end is relatively small, and the setting remains pretty much the same throughout the entire film. Yet, there's not one dull moment to be found, because it becomes so easy to enter into the skin of the soldiers on board. When they're being attacked, or worse, the tension is triple the amount of the one of an average thriller, because there's that feeling of experiencing the movie rather than watching it, making the audience much more involved in the story. This is a very rare trait in cinema today, so when you do see a movie as gripping as "Das Boot", It's something to be recognized, and not modestly.

    Very long (I watched the 3 1/2 hour version of this) with some boring batches, some exciting patches, and some very intense patches (just like submarine life I suppose) Das Boot woke everyone up to the filmmaking skills of Wolfgang Petersen. I had known about this film for years, but never did get around to seeing it. But I finally did. It took about a week or so to watch it mind you, a little bit here, a little bit there. It definitely got better as we went along. I would recommend though, the shorter version first if you haven't seen this, and even if you just DID see the shorter version, unless you've GOT to see this, I think you'll be fine.

    It isn't. It simply isn't. And that is what makes it such a masterpiece. Halfway through the film you forget that the characters are German sailors, you forget about the Nazi ideology, you forget that the story is set in 1941 or even set on planet Earth. Wolfgang Petersen takes you to an alternate dimension, far away from anything we consider human, where there is no right or wrong and your only option is to kill or be killed. And the sensation of death draws ever closer, its certainty slowly driving every single man to insanity. The film is as much a world war 2 movie as "Apocalypse Now" is a movie about Vietnam. It's a psychological ride that makes you think about the nature of humanity and war in general. It's a long movie so get ready and submerge into an painful, terrifying nightmare.

    I saw this film in a theater when it was a recent release, 1982. Was so impressed by the realism that afterward I wrote to a friend: "It makes Star Wars look like a Porky Pig cartoon!" But seriously, the U-boats were a major danger to allied shipping, and American and British sailors cursed at them. Das Boot shows the German side of the story with the crewmen cursing in German (with English subtitles) at the destroyers overhead. The German sailors were shown as regular people bravely doing their best in very difficult situations, not as mindless, fanatical Nazis like a cheesy American film might portray them. The cinematography was excellent, really made me feel like was in sub with them. Thankfully it wasn't in smellovision.

    This film authentically presented the heroics ,bravery and hardships of the German sailors of the Kreiegsrine during the Battle of the Atlantic . The U-Boots of the Kreigsmarine were in tight groups called "Wolf Packs". And their signatures role was to sink Allied supply convoys these submarines were nightmares for enemy merchant ships.Among these submarines were young sailors brave and heroic men these were some were famous commanders such as Otto Kretschmer or Heinrich -Lehmann Willenbrock (who was actually a consultant for this motion picture )others were regular sailors this film chronicles their story . The sets ,the actors and performances were at their utmost authenticity and I personally think that 21st century movies should be more like the hearty,classical movies of the 20th century .
