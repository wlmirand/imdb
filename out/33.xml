 <sinopse>
  A gunslinger is embroiled in a war with a local drug runner.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  With this sequel to his prize-winning independent previous film, "El Mariachi," director Robert Rodriquez joins the ranks of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo as a master of slick, glamorized ultra-violence. We pick up the story as a continuation of "El Mariachi," where an itinerant musician, looking for work, gets mistaken for a hitman and thereby entangled in a web of love, corruption, and death. This time, he is out to avenge the murder of his lover and the maiming of his fretting hand, which occurred at the end of the earlier movie. However, the plot is recapitulated, and again, a case of mistaken identity leads to a very high body count, involvement with a beautiful woman who works for the local drug lord, and finally, the inevitable face-to-face confrontation and bloody showdown.

    Sure, Director Robert Rodriguez created one of the very best indie films with El Mariachi on a shoestring budget. Now, with bucks in his pocket and a name cast, there is room for excellence. Some may say that the low budget effort is better, and I won't totally disagree from an artistic standpoint, but from an entertainment standpoint, this venture with Antonio Bandaras and Salma Hayek is truly a cut above many other films. The state-of-the-art special effects and polished effort Rodriguez put into this film, make for an enjoyable and explosive ride. And did I mention Salma Hayek and her chesty chimichangas?

    Worn and battered from his past escapades, a desperate, handsomely clad musician wielding his guitar case with no guitar stumbles into a small Mexican town kept by a crazed crime lord resolute on finding answers to his lost love. May the bloodshed commence. Desperado is no-holds-barred, action-packed, romance presented in the most stylish of fashions. Writer and director Robert Rodriguez delivers an uncompromising and lustful telling with one goal above anything else - to entertain. Intensified shootouts, passionate dialogue and scenery, this movie is gorgeous. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek are sizzling on-screen. The cast rounds out nicely, the story unfolds very effectively, and all the scenes are well-crafted. Desperado is a sleek, rugged tale aimed to excite and please. It is highly enjoyable. See for yourself.

    Desperado is just another great movie in Robert Rodriguez's career as a filmmaker. You can kind of view it as his first movie where he had a decent budget to work with for a change over the bare bones production of El Mariachi and Roadracers(was just a made for TV movie). Antonio Banderas takes over the role of El Mariachi, this is the sequel to the EM movie. El Mariachi is almost the same thing as Clint Eastwood's character being known as The Man With No Name in Leone's Dollars Trilogy. Salma Hayek puts her name on the map with her scintillating performance. Then you have another of the Rodriguez Regulars with Danny Trejo showing up for a few scenes.

    A gunslinger (Antonio Banderas) is embroiled in a war with a local drug runner. Robert Rodriguez is an interesting character. On one hand, he has made the popular series of children's films, "Spy Kids". And then, he makes some rather gory, very adult, films like this, "Machete", "Planet Terror" and more... how does this work? I am not sure, but he does it very well. While the roles of Steve Buscemi, Quentin Tarantino and Cheech Marin deserve mentioning, this was Antonio Banderas' film beginning to end. He is stylish, a good hero, a good anti-hero in many ways (he is a mass murderer after all)... and a very talented musician. His every move is mesmerizing. The over-the-top violence borders on the humorous, but never quite becomes a comedy. And somehow this works. I could have done without the Salma Hayek romance. I understand films need a romance, but I think this slowed the pace down a bit too much, and the sex scene was simply gratuitous.

    Robert Rodriegez is one of those directors that made one movie and it was so good that he was given money by Hollywood to make more. His first movie, El Mariarchi, is a very low budget movie that I have not yet seen; Desperado is the sequel. The movie is about a man, El Mariarchi, that is little more than a myth. He travels Mexico with a guitar case full of guns looking for a man named Bucho. Bucho murdered his girlfriend and shot him in the hand, and now he wants vengeance. Desperado has little much in the way of a theme except for that of vengeance and its implications. There is a slight twist to the movie, which really means little because it does not really impact the movie that much. The characters are reasonably one dimensional -- El Mariarchi wants vengeance and Bucho does not want to die. These are at the extreme where Bucho has all strangers in the town killed to discover that the Columbian hit-man that was sent to him was one of the victims. El Mariarchi is so obsessed with getting Bucho that he has become a legend and legends attract people who want to defeat them. Everybody distrusts him and he attracts gunfights regularly. Quentin Tarentino appears in this film as a drug courier, and tells a pretty cool joke. I won't repeat it for that will give it away. Cheech Marin (from Cheech and Chong -- and my housemate has never heard of them) plays a bartender. He is not the comic that he was previously, but he does stand out as the bartender. The other interesting thing is the use of guitars. The guitar cases are weapons, carry weapons, drugs, or are simply played. The guitar seems to be a very major focus in this movie, why I cannot say, but really this movie draws little comment. As a movie that Tarentino influenced, it does not seem to show that much depth. The end is interesting, he throws away the guitar case and drives off, and then comes back and says, "we might need this." It seems to suggest that even though he is driving off with the woman, it is not finished.

    Desperado is a very interesting piece of film work. This was my first movie watching Antonio Banderas in rated R movie and I really wasn't sure what to expect - boy was I surprised. This movie is highly entertaining and packs a punch in multiple genres. For the most part, this is one big shoot 'em up movie. Although much of the action scenes are the same, they still somehow end up being exciting to watch no matter how many times you've seen it. This is not your regular western, where people have their little revolvers and twirl them with one finger, no. This is about a man getting revenge for the sake of his loved one using any weapon he can find. As I said before, Antonio Banderas stars as El Mariachi who looks to find revenge on the man who hired a couple of thugs to kill his wife and permanently damage his playing hand. Co-starring with Banderas is actress Salma Hayek. Although back then she was not well known, this is the film that started her career. I think these two actors really do a good job. Not only do they work well together, but also they look good together. Making things even more awesome are the action scenes. The way El Mariachi fires upon the bad guys, the way he leaps and rolls; is just really exciting to watch. The style of the film is done differently than the usual action movies. Out of all the people that are killed by El Mariachi, you would almost think that he's villain, but he's not. The bad guy's henchmen just keep getting in between the cross hairs. Although much of this movie is shooting people, Banderas has many moments of comedy. And it's not like, "Haha! That was a good joke". It's more of, "These guys better watch out, because they don't know who they're messing' with". El Mariachi says it himself, he's just looking for a man. And when he says the man's name, everyone starts shooting at him! He's just looking for a certain guy, why does it matter to them- ...Oh well...that's their fault. Those guys got what was coming for them. They just didn't know that. Finally for the music used in this movie was by Los Lobos. I think Lobos did a great job with the musical score. With the Hispanic tone in every part of the music, it really gets the blood flowing. Because the story is about El Mariachi, it has a lot of guitar. That is what gives the film its zest. Director Robert Rodriguez has recreated El Mariachi and made it into a high spirited "boom" "pow" movie that can make the viewer start jumping out of their seat. With fun performances, loud action and great music, this film is bound to get the attention it wants.

    In a Bar a sort of legend is told. The Mariachi who no longer plays a Guitar. You get to know hes old side as a amazing Guitarrist performing a live-show unlike anyone i heard of before and after. But hes life gets ruined completely. The tragic hero is told to be on hes quest after someone called Bucho. Which never makes true sense to be perfectly honest. But the love for the genre and perfection to all ideas fills Desperado as a ultimate fun action-film. Its never told to be anything more. Almost every scene and every joke are worthy of your time. All the characters are color-full as any could ever possibly be. The tale of the tragic hero is still sensitive. He goes from a clean, nice and peaceful. When forced to violence, a new look appear almost magically on him. The meeting with a kid from the new generation of Mariachis gives it all a deeper dimension. Mostly a fun straight-forward film, done in its own stile. Quentin Tarantino must be doing one of hes greatest achievements right here. The man seem to love jokes, and he perform my personal favorite of all time. Its correct that a movie cant possibly be perfect without a perfect story. But Desperado lets itself be in its own way.

    absolutely amazing, this has to be one of Rodriguez's best movies along with his more recent ones, machete and planet terror. his movies have made TV more than worth watching! and i would rank him with such directors as Tarantino (reservoir dogs, pulp fiction, death proof) and maybe even martin Scorsese (taxi driver, gangs of new york). i wont give too much of the story away other than there's this guy with a guitar case full of guns, played by Banderas. there are also a number of other brilliant actors that Rodriguez has worked with before that star in this flick, such as Cheech Marin and Tarantino. this film takes you on a wild ride of guns and amazing explosions, including a rather bizarre gun that looks like a mens genitals, which is also seen in from dusk till dawn. this movie has one of the best soundtracks that i can recall with as everyone knows is essential in a good film so i'll leave you to have your mind blown, enjoy!

Desperado is a decent but overrated installment in Rodriguez's infamous trilogy. Action scenes are stylish, Banderas is a bad ass, but I felt a bit cold when it was all done. Some of the scenes wowed me, yet some bored me. Banderas's and Hayek's chemistry was the real story here. Performances. Antonio Banderas is as cool as ice here. Unlike Once Upon Time in Mexico, he's able to roam free here. He was highly entertaining. Salma Hayek is easy on the eyes, no doubt, but she can also hold her own acting wise. She's sassy, sexy and credible. Cheech Marin has a cool role as a bartender, while Danny Trejo rocks it. Bottom line. A bit overrated, but the good outweighs the bad for the most part. Settle your expectations and you'll be OK. You might even think it lives up to the hype, but I didn't. Worth a watch. 6 &frac12; 10

    Robert Rodriguez makes a smashing return to the screen after his Sundance hit El Mariachi, this time with a bigger budget and an A-list cast. Desperado continues the story of Rodriguez's man with no name character, El Mariachi. This time Antonio Banderas plays the gun slinging guitarist who is out for revenge against the people who killed his love and shot his hand, ruining his guitar dreams. He gets himself involved in some serious drug running, and his life gets wrapped up with the other various lives entangled in this illegal mess. But, armed to the teeth, El Mariachi fights off those who oppose him killing anyone who gets in his way. Desperado is a whole lot of style, with enough substance to make it worth the watch. Desperado is littered with incredibly fun scenes, that are overly graphic and excitingly glamorous. It is a major departure from the subdued and grittier style of El Mariachi, but it makes for a very different and equally fulfilling experience, at least in the action department. Rodriguez employs a whole new set of stylistic techniques that give Desperado a lot of glitz, but it is not lame glitz. The movie is insanely fun, albeit silly at times. I can't help but enjoy how wacked out this movie is. It's got plenty of full fledged, no holds bars insanity in its action to really keep it a consistently fun movie to watch. The action hardly ever lets up and none of it seems hackish or mediocre. It's all handled very well and keeps up an awesome and gory ride. Desperado is also filled with some great characters, or should I say caricatures, that are all some laugh out loud awesome cameos. Steve Buscemi and Cheech Marin open the movie with an awesome scene where Buscemi narrates an anecdote about El Mariachi shooting up a bar to Marin the bartender. The scene starts the movie off very strong and establishes that this won't be a serious film, but it won't be a tame one either. Other cameos include Quentin Tarantino as "Pick-Up Guy" who doesn't last long but entertains nonetheless, simply because of the fact that it is Quentin freaking Tarantino. I'm not saying he can act but it is hilarious to watch him try. Danny Trejo shows up as a hard boiled Mexican badass who has no dialouge but is still an awesome caricature of the ultra tough mobster. Carlos Gallardo, the original El Mariachi from the 1992 film even cameos as a Mariachi friend of Banderas' El Mariachi. He plays up the action in one of the most ridiculous and awesome final shootout scenes I've seen in a long time. If you enjoy ridiculous and fun characters, Desperado will leave you satisfied. Desperado's story remains very simple, and there isn't much complexity going on. It's not to say that the story is non existent, but it doesn't go much further than your typical revenge story, which is fine when you can back it up with the fresh exciting style that Rodriguez delivers. It's kind of silly to critique this movie brutally on its lack of intricate plot. It's much easier to just take the movie for what it is and enjoy the wild action the film has no shortage of. Desperado doesn't have the same style as El Mariachi, but what it does is very enjoyable. It focuses much more on its style than its substance, but it works for what it's worth. Overall I think I enjoy the grittier and more independent feel of El Mariachi more but Desperado is undeniably fun. The characters are great, the action is intense, and the story is a simplistic yet substantial tale of revenge. This is a worthwhile watch.

    absolutely amazing, this has to be one of Rodriguez's best movies along with his more recent ones, machete and planet terror. his movies have made TV more than worth watching! and i would rank him with such directors as Tarantino (reservoir dogs, pulp fiction, death proof) and maybe even martin Scorsese (taxi driver, gangs of new york). i wont give too much of the story away other than there's this guy with a guitar case full of guns, played by Banderas. there are also a number of other brilliant actors that Rodriguez has worked with before that star in this flick, such as Cheech Marin and Tarantino. this film takes you on a wild ride of guns and amazing explosions, including a rather bizarre gun that looks like a mens genitals, which is also seen in from dusk till dawn. this movie has one of the best soundtracks that i can recall with as everyone knows is essential in a good film so i'll leave you to have your mind blown, enjoy!

    Credit IMDb. With this sequel to his prize-winning independent previous film, "El Mariachi," director Robert Rodriquez joins the ranks of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo as a master of slick, glamorized ultra-violence. We pick up the story as a continuation of "El Mariachi," where an itinerant musician, looking for work, gets mistaken for a hit-man and thereby entangled in a web of love, corruption, and death. This time, he is out to avenge the murder of his lover and the maiming of his fretting hand, which occurred at the end of the earlier movie. However, the plot is recapitulated, and again, a case of mistaken identity leads to a very high body count, involvement with a beautiful woman who works for the local drug lord, and finally, the inevitable face-to-face confrontation and bloody showdown. Desperado is a decent but overrated installment in Rodriguez's infamous trilogy. Action scenes are stylish, Banderas is a bad ass, but I felt a bit cold when it was all done. Some of the scenes wowed me, yet some bored me. Banderas's and Hayek's chemistry was the real story here. Performances. Antonio Banderas is as cool as ice here. Unlike Once Upon Time in Mexico, he's able to roam free here. He was highly entertaining. Salma Hayek is easy on the eyes, no doubt, but she can also hold her own acting wise. She's sassy, sexy and credible. Cheech Marin has a cool role as a bartender, while Danny Trejo rocks it. Bottom line. A bit overrated, but the good outweighs the bad for the most part. Settle your expectations and you'll be OK. You might even think it lives up to the hype, but I didn't. Worth a watch. 6 &frac12; 10

    Robert Rodriguez makes a smashing return to the screen after his Sundance hit El Mariachi, this time with a bigger budget and an A-list cast. Desperado continues the story of Rodriguez's man with no name character, El Mariachi. This time Antonio Banderas plays the gun slinging guitarist who is out for revenge against the people who killed his love and shot his hand, ruining his guitar dreams. He gets himself involved in some serious drug running, and his life gets wrapped up with the other various lives entangled in this illegal mess. But, armed to the teeth, El Mariachi fights off those who oppose him killing anyone who gets in his way. Desperado is a whole lot of style, with enough substance to make it worth the watch. Desperado is littered with incredibly fun scenes, that are overly graphic and excitingly glamorous. It is a major departure from the subdued and grittier style of El Mariachi, but it makes for a very different and equally fulfilling experience, at least in the action department. Rodriguez employs a whole new set of stylistic techniques that give Desperado a lot of glitz, but it is not lame glitz. The movie is insanely fun, albeit silly at times. I can't help but enjoy how wacked out this movie is. It's got plenty of full fledged, no holds bars insanity in its action to really keep it a consistently fun movie to watch. The action hardly ever lets up and none of it seems hackish or mediocre. It's all handled very well and keeps up an awesome and gory ride. Desperado is also filled with some great characters, or should I say caricatures, that are all some laugh out loud awesome cameos. Steve Buscemi and Cheech Marin open the movie with an awesome scene where Buscemi narrates an anecdote about El Mariachi shooting up a bar to Marin the bartender. The scene starts the movie off very strong and establishes that this won't be a serious film, but it won't be a tame one either. Other cameos include Quentin Tarantino as "Pick-Up Guy" who doesn't last long but entertains nonetheless, simply because of the fact that it is Quentin freaking Tarantino. I'm not saying he can act but it is hilarious to watch him try. Danny Trejo shows up as a hard boiled Mexican badass who has no dialouge but is still an awesome caricature of the ultra tough mobster. Carlos Gallardo, the original El Mariachi from the 1992 film even cameos as a Mariachi friend of Banderas' El Mariachi. He plays up the action in one of the most ridiculous and awesome final shootout scenes I've seen in a long time. If you enjoy ridiculous and fun characters, Desperado will leave you satisfied. Desperado's story remains very simple, and there isn't much complexity going on. It's not to say that the story is non existent, but it doesn't go much further than your typical revenge story, which is fine when you can back it up with the fresh exciting style that Rodriguez delivers. It's kind of silly to critique this movie brutally on its lack of intricate plot. It's much easier to just take the movie for what it is and enjoy the wild action the film has no shortage of. Desperado doesn't have the same style as El Mariachi, but what it does is very enjoyable. It focuses much more on its style than its substance, but it works for what it's worth. Overall I think I enjoy the grittier and more independent feel of El Mariachi more but Desperado is undeniably fun. The characters are great, the action is intense, and the story is a simplistic yet substantial tale of revenge. This is a worthwhile watch.

    Sure, Director Robert Rodriguez created one of the very best indie films with El Mariachi on a shoestring budget. Now, with bucks in his pocket and a name cast, there is room for excellence. Some may say that the low budget effort is better, and I won't totally disagree from an artistic standpoint, but from an entertainment standpoint, this venture with Antonio Bandaras and Salma Hayek is truly a cut above many other films. The state-of-the-art special effects and polished effort Rodriguez put into this film, make for an enjoyable and explosive ride. And did I mention Salma Hayek and her chesty chimichangas?

    Worn and battered from his past escapades, a desperate, handsomely clad musician wielding his guitar case with no guitar stumbles into a small Mexican town kept by a crazed crime lord resolute on finding answers to his lost love. May the bloodshed commence. Desperado is no-holds-barred, action-packed, romance presented in the most stylish of fashions. Writer and director Robert Rodriguez delivers an uncompromising and lustful telling with one goal above anything else - to entertain. Intensified shootouts, passionate dialogue and scenery, this movie is gorgeous. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek are sizzling on-screen. The cast rounds out nicely, the story unfolds very effectively, and all the scenes are well-crafted. Desperado is a sleek, rugged tale aimed to excite and please. It is highly enjoyable. See for yourself.

    Desperado is just another great movie in Robert Rodriguez's career as a filmmaker. You can kind of view it as his first movie where he had a decent budget to work with for a change over the bare bones production of El Mariachi and Roadracers(was just a made for TV movie). Antonio Banderas takes over the role of El Mariachi, this is the sequel to the EM movie. El Mariachi is almost the same thing as Clint Eastwood's character being known as The Man With No Name in Leone's Dollars Trilogy. Salma Hayek puts her name on the map with her scintillating performance. Then you have another of the Rodriguez Regulars with Danny Trejo showing up for a few scenes.

    A gunslinger (Antonio Banderas) is embroiled in a war with a local drug runner. Robert Rodriguez is an interesting character. On one hand, he has made the popular series of children's films, "Spy Kids". And then, he makes some rather gory, very adult, films like this, "Machete", "Planet Terror" and more... how does this work? I am not sure, but he does it very well. While the roles of Steve Buscemi, Quentin Tarantino and Cheech Marin deserve mentioning, this was Antonio Banderas' film beginning to end. He is stylish, a good hero, a good anti-hero in many ways (he is a mass murderer after all)... and a very talented musician. His every move is mesmerizing. The over-the-top violence borders on the humorous, but never quite becomes a comedy. And somehow this works. I could have done without the Salma Hayek romance. I understand films need a romance, but I think this slowed the pace down a bit too much, and the sex scene was simply gratuitous.

    Robert Rodriegez is one of those directors that made one movie and it was so good that he was given money by Hollywood to make more. His first movie, El Mariarchi, is a very low budget movie that I have not yet seen; Desperado is the sequel. The movie is about a man, El Mariarchi, that is little more than a myth. He travels Mexico with a guitar case full of guns looking for a man named Bucho. Bucho murdered his girlfriend and shot him in the hand, and now he wants vengeance. Desperado has little much in the way of a theme except for that of vengeance and its implications. There is a slight twist to the movie, which really means little because it does not really impact the movie that much. The characters are reasonably one dimensional -- El Mariarchi wants vengeance and Bucho does not want to die. These are at the extreme where Bucho has all strangers in the town killed to discover that the Columbian hit-man that was sent to him was one of the victims. El Mariarchi is so obsessed with getting Bucho that he has become a legend and legends attract people who want to defeat them. Everybody distrusts him and he attracts gunfights regularly. Quentin Tarentino appears in this film as a drug courier, and tells a pretty cool joke. I won't repeat it for that will give it away. Cheech Marin (from Cheech and Chong -- and my housemate has never heard of them) plays a bartender. He is not the comic that he was previously, but he does stand out as the bartender. The other interesting thing is the use of guitars. The guitar cases are weapons, carry weapons, drugs, or are simply played. The guitar seems to be a very major focus in this movie, why I cannot say, but really this movie draws little comment. As a movie that Tarentino influenced, it does not seem to show that much depth. The end is interesting, he throws away the guitar case and drives off, and then comes back and says, "we might need this." It seems to suggest that even though he is driving off with the woman, it is not finished.

    Desperado is a very interesting piece of film work. This was my first movie watching Antonio Banderas in rated R movie and I really wasn't sure what to expect - boy was I surprised. This movie is highly entertaining and packs a punch in multiple genres. For the most part, this is one big shoot 'em up movie. Although much of the action scenes are the same, they still somehow end up being exciting to watch no matter how many times you've seen it. This is not your regular western, where people have their little revolvers and twirl them with one finger, no. This is about a man getting revenge for the sake of his loved one using any weapon he can find. As I said before, Antonio Banderas stars as El Mariachi who looks to find revenge on the man who hired a couple of thugs to kill his wife and permanently damage his playing hand. Co-starring with Banderas is actress Salma Hayek. Although back then she was not well known, this is the film that started her career. I think these two actors really do a good job. Not only do they work well together, but also they look good together. Making things even more awesome are the action scenes. The way El Mariachi fires upon the bad guys, the way he leaps and rolls; is just really exciting to watch. The style of the film is done differently than the usual action movies. Out of all the people that are killed by El Mariachi, you would almost think that he's villain, but he's not. The bad guy's henchmen just keep getting in between the cross hairs. Although much of this movie is shooting people, Banderas has many moments of comedy. And it's not like, "Haha! That was a good joke". It's more of, "These guys better watch out, because they don't know who they're messing' with". El Mariachi says it himself, he's just looking for a man. And when he says the man's name, everyone starts shooting at him! He's just looking for a certain guy, why does it matter to them- ...Oh well...that's their fault. Those guys got what was coming for them. They just didn't know that. Finally for the music used in this movie was by Los Lobos. I think Lobos did a great job with the musical score. With the Hispanic tone in every part of the music, it really gets the blood flowing. Because the story is about El Mariachi, it has a lot of guitar. That is what gives the film its zest. Director Robert Rodriguez has recreated El Mariachi and made it into a high spirited "boom" "pow" movie that can make the viewer start jumping out of their seat. With fun performances, loud action and great music, this film is bound to get the attention it wants.

    In a Bar a sort of legend is told. The Mariachi who no longer plays a Guitar. You get to know hes old side as a amazing Guitarrist performing a live-show unlike anyone i heard of before and after. But hes life gets ruined completely. The tragic hero is told to be on hes quest after someone called Bucho. Which never makes true sense to be perfectly honest. But the love for the genre and perfection to all ideas fills Desperado as a ultimate fun action-film. Its never told to be anything more. Almost every scene and every joke are worthy of your time. All the characters are color-full as any could ever possibly be. The tale of the tragic hero is still sensitive. He goes from a clean, nice and peaceful. When forced to violence, a new look appear almost magically on him. The meeting with a kid from the new generation of Mariachis gives it all a deeper dimension. Mostly a fun straight-forward film, done in its own stile. Quentin Tarantino must be doing one of hes greatest achievements right here. The man seem to love jokes, and he perform my personal favorite of all time. Its correct that a movie cant possibly be perfect without a perfect story. But Desperado lets itself be in its own way.

    Desperado is a very interesting piece of film work. This was my first movie watching Antonio Banderas in rated R movie and I really wasn't sure what to expect - boy was I surprised. This movie is highly entertaining and packs a punch in multiple genres. For the most part, this is one big shoot 'em up movie. Although much of the action scenes are the same, they still somehow end up being exciting to watch no matter how many times you've seen it. This is not your regular western, where people have their little revolvers and twirl them with one finger, no. This is about a man getting revenge for the sake of his loved one using any weapon he can find. As I said before, Antonio Banderas stars as El Mariachi who looks to find revenge on the man who hired a couple of thugs to kill his wife and permanently damage his playing hand. Co-starring with Banderas is actress Salma Hayek. Although back then she was not well known, this is the film that started her career. I think these two actors really do a good job. Not only do they work well together, but also they look good together. Making things even more awesome are the action scenes. The way El Mariachi fires upon the bad guys, the way he leaps and rolls; is just really exciting to watch. The style of the film is done differently than the usual action movies. Out of all the people that are killed by El Mariachi, you would almost think that he's villain, but he's not. The bad guy's henchmen just keep getting in between the cross hairs. Although much of this movie is shooting people, Banderas has many moments of comedy. And it's not like, "Haha! That was a good joke". It's more of, "These guys better watch out, because they don't know who they're messing' with". El Mariachi says it himself, he's just looking for a man. And when he says the man's name, everyone starts shooting at him! He's just looking for a certain guy, why does it matter to them- ...Oh well...that's their fault. Those guys got what was coming for them. They just didn't know that. Finally for the music used in this movie was by Los Lobos. I think Lobos did a great job with the musical score. With the Hispanic tone in every part of the music, it really gets the blood flowing. Because the story is about El Mariachi, it has a lot of guitar. That is what gives the film its zest. Director Robert Rodriguez has recreated El Mariachi and made it into a high spirited "boom" "pow" movie that can make the viewer start jumping out of their seat. With fun performances, loud action and great music, this film is bound to get the attention it wants.

    In a Bar a sort of legend is told. The Mariachi who no longer plays a Guitar. You get to know hes old side as a amazing Guitarrist performing a live-show unlike anyone i heard of before and after. But hes life gets ruined completely. The tragic hero is told to be on hes quest after someone called Bucho. Which never makes true sense to be perfectly honest. But the love for the genre and perfection to all ideas fills Desperado as a ultimate fun action-film. Its never told to be anything more. Almost every scene and every joke are worthy of your time. All the characters are color-full as any could ever possibly be. The tale of the tragic hero is still sensitive. He goes from a clean, nice and peaceful. When forced to violence, a new look appear almost magically on him. The meeting with a kid from the new generation of Mariachis gives it all a deeper dimension. Mostly a fun straight-forward film, done in its own stile. Quentin Tarantino must be doing one of hes greatest achievements right here. The man seem to love jokes, and he perform my personal favorite of all time. Its correct that a movie cant possibly be perfect without a perfect story. But Desperado lets itself be in its own way.

    absolutely amazing, this has to be one of Rodriguez's best movies along with his more recent ones, machete and planet terror. his movies have made TV more than worth watching! and i would rank him with such directors as Tarantino (reservoir dogs, pulp fiction, death proof) and maybe even martin Scorsese (taxi driver, gangs of new york). i wont give too much of the story away other than there's this guy with a guitar case full of guns, played by Banderas. there are also a number of other brilliant actors that Rodriguez has worked with before that star in this flick, such as Cheech Marin and Tarantino. this film takes you on a wild ride of guns and amazing explosions, including a rather bizarre gun that looks like a mens genitals, which is also seen in from dusk till dawn. this movie has one of the best soundtracks that i can recall with as everyone knows is essential in a good film so i'll leave you to have your mind blown, enjoy!

    Credit IMDb. With this sequel to his prize-winning independent previous film, "El Mariachi," director Robert Rodriquez joins the ranks of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo as a master of slick, glamorized ultra-violence. We pick up the story as a continuation of "El Mariachi," where an itinerant musician, looking for work, gets mistaken for a hit-man and thereby entangled in a web of love, corruption, and death. This time, he is out to avenge the murder of his lover and the maiming of his fretting hand, which occurred at the end of the earlier movie. However, the plot is recapitulated, and again, a case of mistaken identity leads to a very high body count, involvement with a beautiful woman who works for the local drug lord, and finally, the inevitable face-to-face confrontation and bloody showdown. Desperado is a decent but overrated installment in Rodriguez's infamous trilogy. Action scenes are stylish, Banderas is a bad ass, but I felt a bit cold when it was all done. Some of the scenes wowed me, yet some bored me. Banderas's and Hayek's chemistry was the real story here. Performances. Antonio Banderas is as cool as ice here. Unlike Once Upon Time in Mexico, he's able to roam free here. He was highly entertaining. Salma Hayek is easy on the eyes, no doubt, but she can also hold her own acting wise. She's sassy, sexy and credible. Cheech Marin has a cool role as a bartender, while Danny Trejo rocks it. Bottom line. A bit overrated, but the good outweighs the bad for the most part. Settle your expectations and you'll be OK. You might even think it lives up to the hype, but I didn't. Worth a watch. 6 &frac12; 10

    Robert Rodriguez makes a smashing return to the screen after his Sundance hit El Mariachi, this time with a bigger budget and an A-list cast. Desperado continues the story of Rodriguez's man with no name character, El Mariachi. This time Antonio Banderas plays the gun slinging guitarist who is out for revenge against the people who killed his love and shot his hand, ruining his guitar dreams. He gets himself involved in some serious drug running, and his life gets wrapped up with the other various lives entangled in this illegal mess. But, armed to the teeth, El Mariachi fights off those who oppose him killing anyone who gets in his way. Desperado is a whole lot of style, with enough substance to make it worth the watch. Desperado is littered with incredibly fun scenes, that are overly graphic and excitingly glamorous. It is a major departure from the subdued and grittier style of El Mariachi, but it makes for a very different and equally fulfilling experience, at least in the action department. Rodriguez employs a whole new set of stylistic techniques that give Desperado a lot of glitz, but it is not lame glitz. The movie is insanely fun, albeit silly at times. I can't help but enjoy how wacked out this movie is. It's got plenty of full fledged, no holds bars insanity in its action to really keep it a consistently fun movie to watch. The action hardly ever lets up and none of it seems hackish or mediocre. It's all handled very well and keeps up an awesome and gory ride. Desperado is also filled with some great characters, or should I say caricatures, that are all some laugh out loud awesome cameos. Steve Buscemi and Cheech Marin open the movie with an awesome scene where Buscemi narrates an anecdote about El Mariachi shooting up a bar to Marin the bartender. The scene starts the movie off very strong and establishes that this won't be a serious film, but it won't be a tame one either. Other cameos include Quentin Tarantino as "Pick-Up Guy" who doesn't last long but entertains nonetheless, simply because of the fact that it is Quentin freaking Tarantino. I'm not saying he can act but it is hilarious to watch him try. Danny Trejo shows up as a hard boiled Mexican badass who has no dialouge but is still an awesome caricature of the ultra tough mobster. Carlos Gallardo, the original El Mariachi from the 1992 film even cameos as a Mariachi friend of Banderas' El Mariachi. He plays up the action in one of the most ridiculous and awesome final shootout scenes I've seen in a long time. If you enjoy ridiculous and fun characters, Desperado will leave you satisfied. Desperado's story remains very simple, and there isn't much complexity going on. It's not to say that the story is non existent, but it doesn't go much further than your typical revenge story, which is fine when you can back it up with the fresh exciting style that Rodriguez delivers. It's kind of silly to critique this movie brutally on its lack of intricate plot. It's much easier to just take the movie for what it is and enjoy the wild action the film has no shortage of. Desperado doesn't have the same style as El Mariachi, but what it does is very enjoyable. It focuses much more on its style than its substance, but it works for what it's worth. Overall I think I enjoy the grittier and more independent feel of El Mariachi more but Desperado is undeniably fun. The characters are great, the action is intense, and the story is a simplistic yet substantial tale of revenge. This is a worthwhile watch.

    Sure, Director Robert Rodriguez created one of the very best indie films with El Mariachi on a shoestring budget. Now, with bucks in his pocket and a name cast, there is room for excellence. Some may say that the low budget effort is better, and I won't totally disagree from an artistic standpoint, but from an entertainment standpoint, this venture with Antonio Bandaras and Salma Hayek is truly a cut above many other films.

    Worn and battered from his past escapades, a desperate, handsomely clad musician wielding his guitar case with no guitar stumbles into a small Mexican town kept by a crazed crime lord resolute on finding answers to his lost love. May the bloodshed commence. Desperado is no-holds-barred, action-packed, romance presented in the most stylish of fashions. Writer and director Robert Rodriguez delivers an uncompromising and lustful telling with one goal above anything else - to entertain. Intensified shootouts, passionate dialogue and scenery, this movie is gorgeous. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek are sizzling on-screen. The cast rounds out nicely, the story unfolds very effectively, and all the scenes are well-crafted. Desperado is a sleek, rugged tale aimed to excite and please. It is highly enjoyable. See for yourself.

    Desperado is just another great movie in Robert Rodriguez's career as a filmmaker. You can kind of view it as his first movie where he had a decent budget to work with for a change over the bare bones production of El Mariachi and Roadracers(was just a made for TV movie). Antonio Banderas takes over the role of El Mariachi, this is the sequel to the EM movie. El Mariachi is almost the same thing as Clint Eastwood's character being known as The Man With No Name in Leone's Dollars Trilogy. Salma Hayek puts her name on the map with her scintillating performance. Then you have another of the Rodriguez Regulars with Danny Trejo showing up for a few scenes.

    A gunslinger (Antonio Banderas) is embroiled in a war with a local drug runner. Robert Rodriguez is an interesting character. On one hand, he has made the popular series of children's films, "Spy Kids". And then, he makes some rather gory, very adult, films like this, "Machete", "Planet Terror" and more... how does this work? I am not sure, but he does it very well. While the roles of Steve Buscemi, Quentin Tarantino and Cheech Marin deserve mentioning, this was Antonio Banderas' film beginning to end. He is stylish, a good hero, a good anti-hero in many ways (he is a mass murderer after all)... and a very talented musician. His every move is mesmerizing. The over-the-top violence borders on the humorous, but never quite becomes a comedy. And somehow this works. I could have done without the Salma Hayek romance. I understand films need a romance, but I think this slowed the pace down a bit too much, and the sex scene was simply gratuitous.

    Robert Rodriegez is one of those directors that made one movie and it was so good that he was given money by Hollywood to make more. His first movie, El Mariarchi, is a very low budget movie that I have not yet seen; Desperado is the sequel. The movie is about a man, El Mariarchi, that is little more than a myth. He travels Mexico with a guitar case full of guns looking for a man named Bucho. Bucho murdered his girlfriend and shot him in the hand, and now he wants vengeance. Desperado has little much in the way of a theme except for that of vengeance and its implications. There is a slight twist to the movie, which really means little because it does not really impact the movie that much. The characters are reasonably one dimensional -- El Mariarchi wants vengeance and Bucho does not want to die. These are at the extreme where Bucho has all strangers in the town killed to discover that the Columbian hit-man that was sent to him was one of the victims. El Mariarchi is so obsessed with getting Bucho that he has become a legend and legends attract people who want to defeat them. Everybody distrusts him and he attracts gunfights regularly. Quentin Tarentino appears in this film as a drug courier, and tells a pretty cool joke. I won't repeat it for that will give it away. Cheech Marin (from Cheech and Chong -- and my housemate has never heard of them) plays a bartender. He is not the comic that he was previously, but he does stand out as the bartender. The other interesting thing is the use of guitars. The guitar cases are weapons, carry weapons, drugs, or are simply played. The guitar seems to be a very major focus in this movie, why I cannot say, but really this movie draws little comment. As a movie that Tarentino influenced, it does not seem to show that much depth. The end is interesting, he throws away the guitar case and drives off, and then comes back and says, "we might need this." It seems to suggest that even though he is driving off with the woman, it is not finished.

    Desperado is just another great movie in Robert Rodriguez's career as a filmmaker. You can kind of view it as his first movie where he had a decent budget to work with for a change over the bare bones production of El Mariachi and Roadracers(was just a made for TV movie). Antonio Banderas takes over the role of El Mariachi, this is the sequel to the EM movie. El Mariachi is almost the same thing as Clint Eastwood's character being known as The Man With No Name in Leone's Dollars Trilogy. Salma Hayek puts her name on the map with her scintillating performance. Then you have another of the Rodriguez Regulars with Danny Trejo showing up for a few scenes.

    A gunslinger (Antonio Banderas) is embroiled in a war with a local drug runner. Robert Rodriguez is an interesting character. On one hand, he has made the popular series of children's films, "Spy Kids". And then, he makes some rather gory, very adult, films like this, "Machete", "Planet Terror" and more... how does this work? I am not sure, but he does it very well. While the roles of Steve Buscemi, Quentin Tarantino and Cheech Marin deserve mentioning, this was Antonio Banderas' film beginning to end. He is stylish, a good hero, a good anti-hero in many ways (he is a mass murderer after all)... and a very talented musician. His every move is mesmerizing. The over-the-top violence borders on the humorous, but never quite becomes a comedy. And somehow this works. I could have done without the Salma Hayek romance. I understand films need a romance, but I think this slowed the pace down a bit too much, and the sex scene was simply gratuitous.

    Robert Rodriegez is one of those directors that made one movie and it was so good that he was given money by Hollywood to make more. His first movie, El Mariarchi, is a very low budget movie that I have not yet seen; Desperado is the sequel. The movie is about a man, El Mariarchi, that is little more than a myth. He travels Mexico with a guitar case full of guns looking for a man named Bucho. Bucho murdered his girlfriend and shot him in the hand, and now he wants vengeance. Desperado has little much in the way of a theme except for that of vengeance and its implications. There is a slight twist to the movie, which really means little because it does not really impact the movie that much. The characters are reasonably one dimensional -- El Mariarchi wants vengeance and Bucho does not want to die. These are at the extreme where Bucho has all strangers in the town killed to discover that the Columbian hit-man that was sent to him was one of the victims. El Mariarchi is so obsessed with getting Bucho that he has become a legend and legends attract people who want to defeat them. Everybody distrusts him and he attracts gunfights regularly. Quentin Tarentino appears in this film as a drug courier, and tells a pretty cool joke. I won't repeat it for that will give it away. Cheech Marin (from Cheech and Chong -- and my housemate has never heard of them) plays a bartender. He is not the comic that he was previously, but he does stand out as the bartender. The other interesting thing is the use of guitars. The guitar cases are weapons, carry weapons, drugs, or are simply played. The guitar seems to be a very major focus in this movie, why I cannot say, but really this movie draws little comment. As a movie that Tarentino influenced, it does not seem to show that much depth. The end is interesting, he throws away the guitar case and drives off, and then comes back and says, "we might need this." It seems to suggest that even though he is driving off with the woman, it is not finished.

    Desperado is a very interesting piece of film work. This was my first movie watching Antonio Banderas in rated R movie and I really wasn't sure what to expect - boy was I surprised. This movie is highly entertaining and packs a punch in multiple genres. For the most part, this is one big shoot 'em up movie. Although much of the action scenes are the same, they still somehow end up being exciting to watch no matter how many times you've seen it. This is not your regular western, where people have their little revolvers and twirl them with one finger, no. This is about a man getting revenge for the sake of his loved one using any weapon he can find. As I said before, Antonio Banderas stars as El Mariachi who looks to find revenge on the man who hired a couple of thugs to kill his wife and permanently damage his playing hand. Co-starring with Banderas is actress Salma Hayek. Although back then she was not well known, this is the film that started her career. I think these two actors really do a good job. Not only do they work well together, but also they look good together. Making things even more awesome are the action scenes. The way El Mariachi fires upon the bad guys, the way he leaps and rolls; is just really exciting to watch. The style of the film is done differently than the usual action movies. Out of all the people that are killed by El Mariachi, you would almost think that he's villain, but he's not. The bad guy's henchmen just keep getting in between the cross hairs. Although much of this movie is shooting people, Banderas has many moments of comedy. And it's not like, "Haha! That was a good joke". It's more of, "These guys better watch out, because they don't know who they're messing' with". El Mariachi says it himself, he's just looking for a man. And when he says the man's name, everyone starts shooting at him! He's just looking for a certain guy, why does it matter to them- ...Oh well...that's their fault. Those guys got what was coming for them. They just didn't know that. Finally for the music used in this movie was by Los Lobos. I think Lobos did a great job with the musical score. With the Hispanic tone in every part of the music, it really gets the blood flowing. Because the story is about El Mariachi, it has a lot of guitar. That is what gives the film its zest. Director Robert Rodriguez has recreated El Mariachi and made it into a high spirited "boom" "pow" movie that can make the viewer start jumping out of their seat. With fun performances, loud action and great music, this film is bound to get the attention it wants.

    In a Bar a sort of legend is told. The Mariachi who no longer plays a Guitar. You get to know hes old side as a amazing Guitarrist performing a live-show unlike anyone i heard of before and after. But hes life gets ruined completely. The tragic hero is told to be on hes quest after someone called Bucho. Which never makes true sense to be perfectly honest. But the love for the genre and perfection to all ideas fills Desperado as a ultimate fun action-film. Its never told to be anything more. Almost every scene and every joke are worthy of your time. All the characters are color-full as any could ever possibly be. The tale of the tragic hero is still sensitive. He goes from a clean, nice and peaceful. When forced to violence, a new look appear almost magically on him. The meeting with a kid from the new generation of Mariachis gives it all a deeper dimension. Mostly a fun straight-forward film, done in its own stile. Quentin Tarantino must be doing one of hes greatest achievements right here. The man seem to love jokes, and he perform my personal favorite of all time. Its correct that a movie cant possibly be perfect without a perfect story. But Desperado lets itself be in its own way.

    absolutely amazing, this has to be one of Rodriguez's best movies along with his more recent ones, machete and planet terror. his movies have made TV more than worth watching! and i would rank him with such directors as Tarantino (reservoir dogs, pulp fiction, death proof) and maybe even martin Scorsese (taxi driver, gangs of new york). i wont give too much of the story away other than there's this guy with a guitar case full of guns, played by Banderas. there are also a number of other brilliant actors that Rodriguez has worked with before that star in this flick, such as Cheech Marin and Tarantino. this film takes you on a wild ride of guns and amazing explosions, including a rather bizarre gun that looks like a mens genitals, which is also seen in from dusk till dawn. this movie has one of the best soundtracks that i can recall with as everyone knows is essential in a good film so i'll leave you to have your mind blown, enjoy!

    Credit IMDb. With this sequel to his prize-winning independent previous film, "El Mariachi," director Robert Rodriquez joins the ranks of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo as a master of slick, glamorized ultra-violence. We pick up the story as a continuation of "El Mariachi," where an itinerant musician, looking for work, gets mistaken for a hit-man and thereby entangled in a web of love, corruption, and death. This time, he is out to avenge the murder of his lover and the maiming of his fretting hand, which occurred at the end of the earlier movie. However, the plot is recapitulated, and again, a case of mistaken identity leads to a very high body count, involvement with a beautiful woman who works for the local drug lord, and finally, the inevitable face-to-face confrontation and bloody showdown. Desperado is a decent but overrated installment in Rodriguez's infamous trilogy. Action scenes are stylish, Banderas is a bad ass, but I felt a bit cold when it was all done. Some of the scenes wowed me, yet some bored me. Banderas's and Hayek's chemistry was the real story here. Performances. Antonio Banderas is as cool as ice here. Unlike Once Upon Time in Mexico, he's able to roam free here. He was highly entertaining. Salma Hayek is easy on the eyes, no doubt, but she can also hold her own acting wise. She's sassy, sexy and credible. Cheech Marin has a cool role as a bartender, while Danny Trejo rocks it. Bottom line. A bit overrated, but the good outweighs the bad for the most part. Settle your expectations and you'll be OK. You might even think it lives up to the hype, but I didn't. Worth a watch. 6 &frac12; 10

    Robert Rodriguez makes a smashing return to the screen after his Sundance hit El Mariachi, this time with a bigger budget and an A-list cast. Desperado continues the story of Rodriguez's man with no name character, El Mariachi. This time Antonio Banderas plays the gun slinging guitarist who is out for revenge against the people who killed his love and shot his hand, ruining his guitar dreams. He gets himself involved in some serious drug running, and his life gets wrapped up with the other various lives entangled in this illegal mess. But, armed to the teeth, El Mariachi fights off those who oppose him killing anyone who gets in his way. Desperado is a whole lot of style, with enough substance to make it worth the watch. Desperado is littered with incredibly fun scenes, that are overly graphic and excitingly glamorous. It is a major departure from the subdued and grittier style of El Mariachi, but it makes for a very different and equally fulfilling experience, at least in the action department. Rodriguez employs a whole new set of stylistic techniques that give Desperado a lot of glitz, but it is not lame glitz. The movie is insanely fun, albeit silly at times. I can't help but enjoy how wacked out this movie is. It's got plenty of full fledged, no holds bars insanity in its action to really keep it a consistently fun movie to watch. The action hardly ever lets up and none of it seems hackish or mediocre. It's all handled very well and keeps up an awesome and gory ride. Desperado is also filled with some great characters, or should I say caricatures, that are all some laugh out loud awesome cameos. Steve Buscemi and Cheech Marin open the movie with an awesome scene where Buscemi narrates an anecdote about El Mariachi shooting up a bar to Marin the bartender. The scene starts the movie off very strong and establishes that this won't be a serious film, but it won't be a tame one either. Other cameos include Quentin Tarantino as "Pick-Up Guy" who doesn't last long but entertains nonetheless, simply because of the fact that it is Quentin freaking Tarantino. I'm not saying he can act but it is hilarious to watch him try. Danny Trejo shows up as a hard boiled Mexican badass who has no dialouge but is still an awesome caricature of the ultra tough mobster. Carlos Gallardo, the original El Mariachi from the 1992 film even cameos as a Mariachi friend of Banderas' El Mariachi. He plays up the action in one of the most ridiculous and awesome final shootout scenes I've seen in a long time. If you enjoy ridiculous and fun characters, Desperado will leave you satisfied. Desperado's story remains very simple, and there isn't much complexity going on. It's not to say that the story is non existent, but it doesn't go much further than your typical revenge story, which is fine when you can back it up with the fresh exciting style that Rodriguez delivers. It's kind of silly to critique this movie brutally on its lack of intricate plot. It's much easier to just take the movie for what it is and enjoy the wild action the film has no shortage of. Desperado doesn't have the same style as El Mariachi, but what it does is very enjoyable. It focuses much more on its style than its substance, but it works for what it's worth. Overall I think I enjoy the grittier and more independent feel of El Mariachi more but Desperado is undeniably fun. The characters are great, the action is intense, and the story is a simplistic yet substantial tale of revenge. This is a worthwhile watch.

    Sure, Director Robert Rodriguez created one of the very best indie films with El Mariachi on a shoestring budget. Now, with bucks in his pocket and a name cast, there is room for excellence. Some may say that the low budget effort is better, and I won't totally disagree from an artistic standpoint, but from an entertainment standpoint, this venture with Antonio Bandaras and Salma Hayek is truly a cut above many other films. The state-of-the-art special effects and polished effort Rodriguez put into this film, make for an enjoyable and explosive ride. And did I mention Salma Hayek and her chesty chimichangas?

    Worn and battered from his past escapades, a desperate, handsomely clad musician wielding his guitar case with no guitar stumbles into a small Mexican town kept by a crazed crime lord resolute on finding answers to his lost love. May the bloodshed commence. Desperado is no-holds-barred, action-packed, romance presented in the most stylish of fashions. Writer and director Robert Rodriguez delivers an uncompromising and lustful telling with one goal above anything else - to entertain. Intensified shootouts, passionate dialogue and scenery, this movie is gorgeous. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek are sizzling on-screen. The cast rounds out nicely, the story unfolds very effectively, and all the scenes are well-crafted. Desperado is a sleek, rugged tale aimed to excite and please. It is highly enjoyable. See for yourself.

I can't help but enjoy how wacked out this movie is. It's got plenty of full fledged, no holds bars insanity in its action to really keep it a consistently fun movie to watch. The action hardly ever lets up and none of it seems hackish or mediocre. It's all handled very well and keeps up an awesome and gory ride. Desperado is also filled with some great characters, or should I say caricatures, that are all some laugh out loud awesome cameos. Steve Buscemi and Cheech Marin open the movie with an awesome scene where Buscemi narrates an anecdote about El Mariachi shooting up a bar to Marin the bartender. The scene starts the movie off very strong and establishes that this won't be a serious film, but it won't be a tame one either. Other cameos include Quentin Tarantino as "Pick-Up Guy" who doesn't last long but entertains nonetheless, simply because of the fact that it is Quentin freaking Tarantino. I'm not saying he can act but it is hilarious to watch him try. Danny Trejo shows up as a hard boiled Mexican badass who has no dialouge but is still an awesome caricature of the ultra tough mobster. Carlos Gallardo, the original El Mariachi from the 1992 film even cameos as a Mariachi friend of Banderas' El Mariachi. He plays up the action in one of the most ridiculous and awesome final shootout scenes I've seen in a long time. If you enjoy ridiculous and fun characters, Desperado will leave you satisfied. Desperado's story remains very simple, and there isn't much complexity going on. It's not to say that the story is non existent, but it doesn't go much further than your typical revenge story, which is fine when you can back it up with the fresh exciting style that Rodriguez delivers. It's kind of silly to critique this movie brutally on its lack of intricate plot. It's much easier to just take the movie for what it is and enjoy the wild action the film has no shortage of. Desperado doesn't have the same style as El Mariachi, but what it does is very enjoyable. It focuses much more on its style than its substance, but it works for what it's worth. Overall I think I enjoy the grittier and more independent feel of El Mariachi more but Desperado is undeniably fun. The characters are great, the action is intense, and the story is a simplistic yet substantial tale of revenge. This is a worthwhile watch.

    Sure, Director Robert Rodriguez created one of the very best indie films with El Mariachi on a shoestring budget. Now, with bucks in his pocket and a name cast, there is room for excellence. Some may say that the low budget effort is better, and I won't totally disagree from an artistic standpoint, but from an entertainment standpoint, this venture with Antonio Bandaras and Salma Hayek is truly a cut above many other films. The state-of-the-art special effects and polished effort Rodriguez put into this film, make for an enjoyable and explosive ride. And did I mention Salma Hayek and her chesty chimichangas?

    Worn and battered from his past escapades, a desperate, handsomely clad musician wielding his guitar case with no guitar stumbles into a small Mexican town kept by a crazed crime lord resolute on finding answers to his lost love. May the bloodshed commence. Desperado is no-holds-barred, action-packed, romance presented in the most stylish of fashions. Writer and director Robert Rodriguez delivers an uncompromising and lustful telling with one goal above anything else - to entertain. Intensified shootouts, passionate dialogue and scenery, this movie is gorgeous. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek are sizzling on-screen. The cast rounds out nicely, the story unfolds very effectively, and all the scenes are well-crafted. Desperado is a sleek, rugged tale aimed to excite and please. It is highly enjoyable. See for yourself.

    Desperado is just another great movie in Robert Rodriguez's career as a filmmaker. You can kind of view it as his first movie where he had a decent budget to work with for a change over the bare bones production of El Mariachi and Roadracers(was just a made for TV movie). Antonio Banderas takes over the role of El Mariachi, this is the sequel to the EM movie. El Mariachi is almost the same thing as Clint Eastwood's character being known as The Man With No Name in Leone's Dollars Trilogy. Salma Hayek puts her name on the map with her scintillating performance. Then you have another of the Rodriguez Regulars with Danny Trejo showing up for a few scenes.

    A gunslinger (Antonio Banderas) is embroiled in a war with a local drug runner. Robert Rodriguez is an interesting character. On one hand, he has made the popular series of children's films, "Spy Kids". And then, he makes some rather gory, very adult, films like this, "Machete", "Planet Terror" and more... how does this work? I am not sure, but he does it very well. While the roles of Steve Buscemi, Quentin Tarantino and Cheech Marin deserve mentioning, this was Antonio Banderas' film beginning to end. He is stylish, a good hero, a good anti-hero in many ways (he is a mass murderer after all)... and a very talented musician. His every move is mesmerizing. The over-the-top violence borders on the humorous, but never quite becomes a comedy. And somehow this works. I could have done without the Salma Hayek romance. I understand films need a romance, but I think this slowed the pace down a bit too much, and the sex scene was simply gratuitous.

    Robert Rodriegez is one of those directors that made one movie and it was so good that he was given money by Hollywood to make more. His first movie, El Mariarchi, is a very low budget movie that I have not yet seen; Desperado is the sequel. The movie is about a man, El Mariarchi, that is little more than a myth. He travels Mexico with a guitar case full of guns looking for a man named Bucho. Bucho murdered his girlfriend and shot him in the hand, and now he wants vengeance. Desperado has little much in the way of a theme except for that of vengeance and its implications. There is a slight twist to the movie, which really means little because it does not really impact the movie that much. The characters are reasonably one dimensional -- El Mariarchi wants vengeance and Bucho does not want to die. These are at the extreme where Bucho has all strangers in the town killed to discover that the Columbian hit-man that was sent to him was one of the victims. El Mariarchi is so obsessed with getting Bucho that he has become a legend and legends attract people who want to defeat them. Everybody distrusts him and he attracts gunfights regularly. Quentin Tarentino appears in this film as a drug courier, and tells a pretty cool joke. I won't repeat it for that will give it away. Cheech Marin (from Cheech and Chong -- and my housemate has never heard of them) plays a bartender. He is not the comic that he was previously, but he does stand out as the bartender. The other interesting thing is the use of guitars. The guitar cases are weapons, carry weapons, drugs, or are simply played. The guitar seems to be a very major focus in this movie, why I cannot say, but really this movie draws little comment. As a movie that Tarentino influenced, it does not seem to show that much depth. The end is interesting, he throws away the guitar case and drives off, and then comes back and says, "we might need this." It seems to suggest that even though he is driving off with the woman, it is not finished.

    Desperado is a very interesting piece of film work. This was my first movie watching Antonio Banderas in rated R movie and I really wasn't sure what to expect - boy was I surprised. This movie is highly entertaining and packs a punch in multiple genres. For the most part, this is one big shoot 'em up movie. Although much of the action scenes are the same, they still somehow end up being exciting to watch no matter how many times you've seen it. This is not your regular western, where people have their little revolvers and twirl them with one finger, no. This is about a man getting revenge for the sake of his loved one using any weapon he can find. As I said before, Antonio Banderas stars as El Mariachi who looks to find revenge on the man who hired a couple of thugs to kill his wife and permanently damage his playing hand. Co-starring with Banderas is actress Salma Hayek. Although back then she was not well known, this is the film that started her career. I think these two actors really do a good job. Not only do they work well together, but also they look good together. Making things even more awesome are the action scenes. The way El Mariachi fires upon the bad guys, the way he leaps and rolls; is just really exciting to watch. The style of the film is done differently than the usual action movies. Out of all the people that are killed by El Mariachi, you would almost think that he's villain, but he's not. The bad guy's henchmen just keep getting in between the cross hairs. Although much of this movie is shooting people, Banderas has many moments of comedy. And it's not like, "Haha! That was a good joke". It's more of, "These guys better watch out, because they don't know who they're messing' with". El Mariachi says it himself, he's just looking for a man. And when he says the man's name, everyone starts shooting at him! He's just looking for a certain guy, why does it matter to them- ...Oh well...that's their fault. Those guys got what was coming for them. They just didn't know that. Finally for the music used in this movie was by Los Lobos. I think Lobos did a great job with the musical score. With the Hispanic tone in every part of the music, it really gets the blood flowing. Because the story is about El Mariachi, it has a lot of guitar. That is what gives the film its zest. Director Robert Rodriguez has recreated El Mariachi and made it into a high spirited "boom" "pow" movie that can make the viewer start jumping out of their seat. With fun performances, loud action and great music, this film is bound to get the attention it wants.

    In a Bar a sort of legend is told. The Mariachi who no longer plays a Guitar. You get to know hes old side as a amazing Guitarrist performing a live-show unlike anyone i heard of before and after. But hes life gets ruined completely. The tragic hero is told to be on hes quest after someone called Bucho. Which never makes true sense to be perfectly honest. But the love for the genre and perfection to all ideas fills Desperado as a ultimate fun action-film. Its never told to be anything more. Almost every scene and every joke are worthy of your time. All the characters are color-full as any could ever possibly be. The tale of the tragic hero is still sensitive. He goes from a clean, nice and peaceful. When forced to violence, a new look appear almost magically on him. The meeting with a kid from the new generation of Mariachis gives it all a deeper dimension. Mostly a fun straight-forward film, done in its own stile. Quentin Tarantino must be doing one of hes greatest achievements right here. The man seem to love jokes, and he perform my personal favorite of all time. Its correct that a movie cant possibly be perfect without a perfect story. But Desperado lets itself be in its own way.

    absolutely amazing, this has to be one of Rodriguez's best movies along with his more recent ones, machete and planet terror. his movies have made TV more than worth watching! and i would rank him with such directors as Tarantino (reservoir dogs, pulp fiction, death proof) and maybe even martin Scorsese (taxi driver, gangs of new york). i wont give too much of the story away other than there's this guy with a guitar case full of guns, played by Banderas. there are also a number of other brilliant actors that Rodriguez has worked with before that star in this flick, such as Cheech Marin and Tarantino. this film takes you on a wild ride of guns and amazing explosions, including a rather bizarre gun that looks like a mens genitals, which is also seen in from dusk till dawn. this movie has one of the best soundtracks that i can recall with as everyone knows is essential in a good film so i'll leave you to have your mind blown, enjoy!

    Credit IMDb. With this sequel to his prize-winning independent previous film, "El Mariachi," director Robert Rodriquez joins the ranks of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo as a master of slick, glamorized ultra-violence. We pick up the story as a continuation of "El Mariachi," where an itinerant musician, looking for work, gets mistaken for a hit-man and thereby entangled in a web of love, corruption, and death. This time, he is out to avenge the murder of his lover and the maiming of his fretting hand, which occurred at the end of the earlier movie. However, the plot is recapitulated, and again, a case of mistaken identity leads to a very high body count, involvement with a beautiful woman who works for the local drug lord, and finally, the inevitable face-to-face confrontation and bloody showdown. Desperado is a decent but overrated installment in Rodriguez's infamous trilogy. Action scenes are stylish, Banderas is a bad ass, but I felt a bit cold when it was all done. Some of the scenes wowed me, yet some bored me. Banderas's and Hayek's chemistry was the real story here. Performances. Antonio Banderas is as cool as ice here. Unlike Once Upon Time in Mexico, he's able to roam free here. He was highly entertaining. Salma Hayek is easy on the eyes, no doubt, but she can also hold her own acting wise. She's sassy, sexy and credible. Cheech Marin has a cool role as a bartender, while Danny Trejo rocks it. Bottom line. A bit overrated, but the good outweighs the bad for the most part. Settle your expectations and you'll be OK. You might even think it lives up to the hype, but I didn't. Worth a watch. 6 &frac12; 10

    Robert Rodriguez makes a smashing return to the screen after his Sundance hit El Mariachi, this time with a bigger budget and an A-list cast. Desperado continues the story of Rodriguez's man with no name character, El Mariachi. This time Antonio Banderas plays the gun slinging guitarist who is out for revenge against the people who killed his love and shot his hand, ruining his guitar dreams. He gets himself involved in some serious drug running, and his life gets wrapped up with the other various lives entangled in this illegal mess. But, armed to the teeth, El Mariachi fights off those who oppose him killing anyone who gets in his way. Desperado is a whole lot of style, with enough substance to make it worth the watch. Desperado is littered with incredibly fun scenes, that are overly graphic and excitingly glamorous. It is a major departure from the subdued and grittier style of El Mariachi, but it makes for a very different and equally fulfilling experience, at least in the action department. Rodriguez employs a whole new set of stylistic techniques that give Desperado a lot of glitz, but it is not lame glitz. The movie is insanely fun, albeit silly at times. I can't help but enjoy how wacked out this movie is. It's got plenty of full fledged, no holds bars insanity in its action to really keep it a consistently fun movie to watch. The action hardly ever lets up and none of it seems hackish or mediocre. It's all handled very well and keeps up an awesome and gory ride. Desperado is also filled with some great characters, or should I say caricatures, that are all some laugh out loud awesome cameos. Steve Buscemi and Cheech Marin open the movie with an awesome scene where Buscemi narrates an anecdote about El Mariachi shooting up a bar to Marin the bartender. The scene starts the movie off very strong and establishes that this won't be a serious film, but it won't be a tame one either. Other cameos include Quentin Tarantino as "Pick-Up Guy" who doesn't last long but entertains nonetheless, simply because of the fact that it is Quentin freaking Tarantino. I'm not saying he can act but it is hilarious to watch him try. Danny Trejo shows up as a hard boiled Mexican badass who has no dialouge but is still an awesome caricature of the ultra tough mobster. Carlos Gallardo, the original El Mariachi from the 1992 film even cameos as a Mariachi friend of Banderas' El Mariachi. He plays up the action in one of the most ridiculous and awesome final shootout scenes I've seen in a long time. If you enjoy ridiculous and fun characters, Desperado will leave you satisfied.

    absolutely amazing, this has to be one of Rodriguez's best movies along with his more recent ones, machete and planet terror. his movies have made TV more than worth watching! and i would rank him with such directors as Tarantino (reservoir dogs, pulp fiction, death proof) and maybe even martin Scorsese (taxi driver, gangs of new york). i wont give too much of the story away other than there's this guy with a guitar case full of guns, played by Banderas. there are also a number of other brilliant actors that Rodriguez has worked with before that star in this flick, such as Cheech Marin and Tarantino. this film takes you on a wild ride of guns and amazing explosions, including a rather bizarre gun that looks like a mens genitals, which is also seen in from dusk till dawn. this movie has one of the best soundtracks that i can recall with as everyone knows is essential in a good film so i'll leave you to have your mind blown, enjoy!

    Credit IMDb. With this sequel to his prize-winning independent previous film, "El Mariachi," director Robert Rodriquez joins the ranks of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo as a master of slick, glamorized ultra-violence. We pick up the story as a continuation of "El Mariachi," where an itinerant musician, looking for work, gets mistaken for a hit-man and thereby entangled in a web of love, corruption, and death. This time, he is out to avenge the murder of his lover and the maiming of his fretting hand, which occurred at the end of the earlier movie. However, the plot is recapitulated, and again, a case of mistaken identity leads to a very high body count, involvement with a beautiful woman who works for the local drug lord, and finally, the inevitable face-to-face confrontation and bloody showdown. Desperado is a decent but overrated installment in Rodriguez's infamous trilogy. Action scenes are stylish, Banderas is a bad ass, but I felt a bit cold when it was all done. Some of the scenes wowed me, yet some bored me. Banderas's and Hayek's chemistry was the real story here. Performances. Antonio Banderas is as cool as ice here. Unlike Once Upon Time in Mexico, he's able to roam free here. He was highly entertaining. Salma Hayek is easy on the eyes, no doubt, but she can also hold her own acting wise. She's sassy, sexy and credible. Cheech Marin has a cool role as a bartender, while Danny Trejo rocks it. Bottom line. A bit overrated, but the good outweighs the bad for the most part. Settle your expectations and you'll be OK. You might even think it lives up to the hype, but I didn't. Worth a watch. 6 &frac12; 10

    Robert Rodriguez makes a smashing return to the screen after his Sundance hit El Mariachi, this time with a bigger budget and an A-list cast. Desperado continues the story of Rodriguez's man with no name character, El Mariachi. This time Antonio Banderas plays the gun slinging guitarist who is out for revenge against the people who killed his love and shot his hand, ruining his guitar dreams. He gets himself involved in some serious drug running, and his life gets wrapped up with the other various lives entangled in this illegal mess. But, armed to the teeth, El Mariachi fights off those who oppose him killing anyone who gets in his way. Desperado is a whole lot of style, with enough substance to make it worth the watch. Desperado is littered with incredibly fun scenes, that are overly graphic and excitingly glamorous. It is a major departure from the subdued and grittier style of El Mariachi, but it makes for a very different and equally fulfilling experience, at least in the action department. Rodriguez employs a whole new set of stylistic techniques that give Desperado a lot of glitz, but it is not lame glitz. The movie is insanely fun, albeit silly at times. I can't help but enjoy how wacked out this movie is. It's got plenty of full fledged, no holds bars insanity in its action to really keep it a consistently fun movie to watch. The action hardly ever lets up and none of it seems hackish or mediocre. It's all handled very well and keeps up an awesome and gory ride. Desperado is also filled with some great characters, or should I say caricatures, that are all some laugh out loud awesome cameos. Steve Buscemi and Cheech Marin open the movie with an awesome scene where Buscemi narrates an anecdote about El Mariachi shooting up a bar to Marin the bartender. The scene starts the movie off very strong and establishes that this won't be a serious film, but it won't be a tame one either. Other cameos include Quentin Tarantino as "Pick-Up Guy" who doesn't last long but entertains nonetheless, simply because of the fact that it is Quentin freaking Tarantino. I'm not saying he can act but it is hilarious to watch him try. Danny Trejo shows up as a hard boiled Mexican badass who has no dialouge but is still an awesome caricature of the ultra tough mobster. Carlos Gallardo, the original El Mariachi from the 1992 film even cameos as a Mariachi friend of Banderas' El Mariachi. He plays up the action in one of the most ridiculous and awesome final shootout scenes I've seen in a long time. If you enjoy ridiculous and fun characters, Desperado will leave you satisfied. Desperado's story remains very simple, and there isn't much complexity going on. It's not to say that the story is non existent, but it doesn't go much further than your typical revenge story, which is fine when you can back it up with the fresh exciting style that Rodriguez delivers. It's kind of silly to critique this movie brutally on its lack of intricate plot. It's much easier to just take the movie for what it is and enjoy the wild action the film has no shortage of. Desperado doesn't have the same style as El Mariachi, but what it does is very enjoyable. It focuses much more on its style than its substance, but it works for what it's worth. Overall I think I enjoy the grittier and more independent feel of El Mariachi more but Desperado is undeniably fun. The characters are great, the action is intense, and the story is a simplistic yet substantial tale of revenge. This is a worthwhile watch.

    Sure, Director Robert Rodriguez created one of the very best indie films with El Mariachi on a shoestring budget. Now, with bucks in his pocket and a name cast, there is room for excellence. Some may say that the low budget effort is better, and I won't totally disagree from an artistic standpoint, but from an entertainment standpoint, this venture with Antonio Bandaras and Salma Hayek is truly a cut above many other films. The state-of-the-art special effects and polished effort Rodriguez put into this film, make for an enjoyable and explosive ride. And did I mention Salma Hayek and her chesty chimichangas?

    Worn and battered from his past escapades, a desperate, handsomely clad musician wielding his guitar case with no guitar stumbles into a small Mexican town kept by a crazed crime lord resolute on finding answers to his lost love. May the bloodshed commence. Desperado is no-holds-barred, action-packed, romance presented in the most stylish of fashions. Writer and director Robert Rodriguez delivers an uncompromising and lustful telling with one goal above anything else - to entertain. Intensified shootouts, passionate dialogue and scenery, this movie is gorgeous. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek are sizzling on-screen. The cast rounds out nicely, the story unfolds very effectively, and all the scenes are well-crafted. Desperado is a sleek, rugged tale aimed to excite and please. It is highly enjoyable. See for yourself.

    Desperado is just another great movie in Robert Rodriguez's career as a filmmaker. You can kind of view it as his first movie where he had a decent budget to work with for a change over the bare bones production of El Mariachi and Roadracers(was just a made for TV movie). Antonio Banderas takes over the role of El Mariachi, this is the sequel to the EM movie. El Mariachi is almost the same thing as Clint Eastwood's character being known as The Man With No Name in Leone's Dollars Trilogy. Salma Hayek puts her name on the map with her scintillating performance. Then you have another of the Rodriguez Regulars with Danny Trejo showing up for a few scenes.

    A gunslinger (Antonio Banderas) is embroiled in a war with a local drug runner. Robert Rodriguez is an interesting character. On one hand, he has made the popular series of children's films, "Spy Kids". And then, he makes some rather gory, very adult, films like this, "Machete", "Planet Terror" and more... how does this work? I am not sure, but he does it very well. While the roles of Steve Buscemi, Quentin Tarantino and Cheech Marin deserve mentioning, this was Antonio Banderas' film beginning to end. He is stylish, a good hero, a good anti-hero in many ways (he is a mass murderer after all)... and a very talented musician. His every move is mesmerizing. The over-the-top violence borders on the humorous, but never quite becomes a comedy. And somehow this works. I could have done without the Salma Hayek romance. I understand films need a romance, but I think this slowed the pace down a bit too much, and the sex scene was simply gratuitous.

    Robert Rodriegez is one of those directors that made one movie and it was so good that he was given money by Hollywood to make more. His first movie, El Mariarchi, is a very low budget movie that I have not yet seen; Desperado is the sequel. The movie is about a man, El Mariarchi, that is little more than a myth. He travels Mexico with a guitar case full of guns looking for a man named Bucho. Bucho murdered his girlfriend and shot him in the hand, and now he wants vengeance. Desperado has little much in the way of a theme except for that of vengeance and its implications. There is a slight twist to the movie, which really means little because it does not really impact the movie that much. The characters are reasonably one dimensional -- El Mariarchi wants vengeance and Bucho does not want to die. These are at the extreme where Bucho has all strangers in the town killed to discover that the Columbian hit-man that was sent to him was one of the victims. El Mariarchi is so obsessed with getting Bucho that he has become a legend and legends attract people who want to defeat them. Everybody distrusts him and he attracts gunfights regularly. Quentin Tarentino appears in this film as a drug courier, and tells a pretty cool joke. I won't repeat it for that will give it away. Cheech Marin (from Cheech and Chong -- and my housemate has never heard of them) plays a bartender. He is not the comic that he was previously, but he does stand out as the bartender. The other interesting thing is the use of guitars. The guitar cases are weapons, carry weapons, drugs, or are simply played. The guitar seems to be a very major focus in this movie, why I cannot say, but really this movie draws little comment. As a movie that Tarentino influenced, it does not seem to show that much depth. The end is interesting, he throws away the guitar case and drives off, and then comes back and says, "we might need this." It seems to suggest that even though he is driving off with the woman, it is not finished.

    Desperado is a very interesting piece of film work. This was my first movie watching Antonio Banderas in rated R movie and I really wasn't sure what to expect - boy was I surprised. This movie is highly entertaining and packs a punch in multiple genres. For the most part, this is one big shoot 'em up movie. Although much of the action scenes are the same, they still somehow end up being exciting to watch no matter how many times you've seen it. This is not your regular western, where people have their little revolvers and twirl them with one finger, no. This is about a man getting revenge for the sake of his loved one using any weapon he can find. As I said before, Antonio Banderas stars as El Mariachi who looks to find revenge on the man who hired a couple of thugs to kill his wife and permanently damage his playing hand. Co-starring with Banderas is actress Salma Hayek. Although back then she was not well known, this is the film that started her career. I think these two actors really do a good job. Not only do they work well together, but also they look good together. Making things even more awesome are the action scenes. The way El Mariachi fires upon the bad guys, the way he leaps and rolls; is just really exciting to watch. The style of the film is done differently than the usual action movies. Out of all the people that are killed by El Mariachi, you would almost think that he's villain, but he's not. The bad guy's henchmen just keep getting in between the cross hairs. Although much of this movie is shooting people, Banderas has many moments of comedy. And it's not like, "Haha! That was a good joke". It's more of, "These guys better watch out, because they don't know who they're messing' with". El Mariachi says it himself, he's just looking for a man. And when he says the man's name, everyone starts shooting at him! He's just looking for a certain guy, why does it matter to them- ...Oh well...that's their fault. Those guys got what was coming for them. They just didn't know that. Finally for the music used in this movie was by Los Lobos. I think Lobos did a great job with the musical score. With the Hispanic tone in every part of the music, it really gets the blood flowing. Because the story is about El Mariachi, it has a lot of guitar. That is what gives the film its zest. Director Robert Rodriguez has recreated El Mariachi and made it into a high spirited "boom" "pow" movie that can make the viewer start jumping out of their seat. With fun performances, loud action and great music, this film is bound to get the attention it wants.

    In a Bar a sort of legend is told. The Mariachi who no longer plays a Guitar. You get to know hes old side as a amazing Guitarrist performing a live-show unlike anyone i heard of before and after. But hes life gets ruined completely. The tragic hero is told to be on hes quest after someone called Bucho. Which never makes true sense to be perfectly honest. But the love for the genre and perfection to all ideas fills Desperado as a ultimate fun action-film. Its never told to be anything more. Almost every scene and every joke are worthy of your time. All the characters are color-full as any could ever possibly be. The tale of the tragic hero is still sensitive. He goes from a clean, nice and peaceful. When forced to violence, a new look appear almost magically on him. The meeting with a kid from the new generation of Mariachis gives it all a deeper dimension. Mostly a fun straight-forward film, done in its own stile. Quentin Tarantino must be doing one of hes greatest achievements right here. The man seem to love jokes, and he perform my personal favorite of all time. Its correct that a movie cant possibly be perfect without a perfect story. But Desperado lets itself be in its own way.
