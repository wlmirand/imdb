    What's Love Got to Do With It If it weren't for females, record labels would have to rely solely on money and cocaine to entice potential male acts. However, the male singer in this biography needs a woman to complete his act. Abandoned by her family, Anna Mae (Angela Bassett) grows up with nothing but her unorthodox singing voice to keep her company. In her teens, she auditions for local bandleader/lothario Ike (Laurence Fishburne), who is impressed by her pipes. Joining him and his band under the moniker Tina, Anna Mae begins banging out the hits, while her new husband begins banging on her. Under Ike's thumb, Tina is unable to branch out and become the star she's destined to be. Based on Tina Turner's biography, WLGTDWI is a superbly acted, heartbreaking tale of overcoming domestic abuse in an era of blind eyes. Fortunately, domestic violence in today's music has been restricted to the Top 40 list. (Green Light)

    Personally I'm not especially keen on this type of movie; movies packed with music numbers. But after all, it is the grand old lady Tina Turner we are talking about; she deserves more than something average. I really did like her songs in the 80s when she got rid of her abusive husband Ike. Her voice was strong and with a great personality. The relationship between Ike and Tina was almost made for a movie; there is drama, violence, and music. The title really says it all. Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne are stunning as the main characters. Bassett got the nearly impossible job to portrait one of the most remarkable female artists in music history especially when it comes to the body language of Tina. However, Angela Bassett did it very well. Also in scenes with playback I could hardly notice it was an actor imitating a great rock star. Overall a very good movie, but like I said; too many music scenes that I felt interrupted the story. But most of the songs are well known - and good!

    It took me a while (18 years), but at my wife's urging I finally got round to watching this superb film about the harrowing life of popular singer Tina Turner. The film is brilliantly directed by the late Brian Gibson, whose previous film in 1991 had been the life story of another famous black singer, Josephine Baker. But the film sizzles and fascinates primarily because of the sensational performance of Angela Bassett as Tina Turner. She is simply a knock-out. I presume her singing may have been dubbed by Turner herself. But whether she sang or not, her performance was dazzling, full of charm and sweetness as well as conveying all the heartache, emotional confusion and weakness, joys and sorrows. This is really a superior biopic, and the true story has plenty to tell! One should not neglect to mention that the little girl who plays Tina as a child, Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly, is also superb. (She has grown up and appeared now in 42 films.) Tina Turner had a rough time in life, and it is shown very vividly in this film. She married an egocentric, violent, borderline psychopath named Ike Turner (died 2007), who beat her up regularly for years. Men who beat up women are really sick, but women who let men beat them up year in and year out without leaving them are sick too. In the film her excuse for not leaving Ike is said to be because she 'can't abandon family', due to the trauma of her horrible mother having abandoned her as a child. That does not wash. But let us not heap blame upon the ravaged Tina Turner for the horrors she endured and for her determination over so many years to remain a victim rather than save herself. At last she did summon up the courage to save herself, and she also went on to reinvent herself. So this is a story of heroic endurance and dedication to her art by a girl who was born to sing. If she suffered a lot along the way, well, that's life. But the songs go on.

    Angela Bassett, as Tina Turner asks the musical question "What's Love Got to Do with It" in this 1993 film also starring Laurence Fishburne, Jenifer Lewis, and Khandi Alexander. The film tells the story of Tina Turner's childhood as Anna Mae Bullock her move to St. Louis after her grandmother's death to live with her mother, her meeting Ike Turner at a nightclub, her subsequent singing with Ike's band, their marriage and divorce. By necessity, biopics have to leave out people and incidents, often combining several incidents into one or skipping several steps. In no way does a knowledge of Tina Turner''s life detract from the impact of this film. It's a story of a woman's determination, beating the odds, suffering, perseverance and ultimate success. Ike's and Tina's marriage was pretty much a horror show. Ike was always controlling, to the detriment of his own career, and as he turned to drugs, his abuse of Tina escalated. The most stunning scene in the film (besides the performances, which are fantastic) occurs when the couple fights in a limo en route to a hotel. Ike becomes physical; Tina has discovered Buddhism and finally gets the courage to fight back. A bloody mess, she runs away from him with only 36 cents in her purse. Angela Bassett gives a searing, electrifying performance as Turner. Her sinewy body is a great match for Turner's, and she uses it to perfection in replicating Turner's performances (Turner's voice is used on the soundtrack). She shows the star's vulnerability, fear, and internal strength throughout. Bassett is matched by Laurence Fishburne's terrifying performance as Ike. Fishburne seethes with manipulation and anger, even in scenes where he's being "nice." When Ike loses his temper, you can see how he can't stop and the violence just gets worth. A brilliant performance. A must see. The latter part of Turner's life is not explored, but while she always remained popular in Europe, it was a long time before she could get a recording contract here after some failed recordings. Today she remains one of the greatest singing stars ever. But there were lots of valleys in between.

    There is plenty wrong with this movie as a biopic, however when you look at it as purely being a movie, it is a surprisingly great one. I never really considered Tina Turner to be such a good subject for a biopic, especially not in the '90's. First of all she was still alive and at an all time popular height and second of all, she in my opinion is not a that big star, when compared to all other people who get a biopic made about them. But I must say that after seeing this movie i have a whole lot more respect for her by now and I was definitely wrong about her career and life not being worthy or interesting enough for making a movie about it. The movie was a positive surprise. But nevertheless there still is plenty wrong with it as a biopic. It suffers from lots of the stuff other genre movies often suffer from. Thing with biopics often is that you try to capture a persons entire life and career into a 2 hour long movie. This means some stuff will often get rushed and shoved down your throat. You often just have to take things for granted, without them ever getting developed properly and convincing enough, like would be the case in a normal film drama about a normal average, every day person. And yes, this happens quite a lot in this movie. It often makes some very sudden jumps with its story and make jumps in time as well. We just never get to see how popular Tina Tuner is with the public and some things seem to happen very randomly in this movie, just because they happened in her real life as well. It at times feels like some stuff really got crow-bared into the film. They movie because of that also feels quite distant at times as a biopic, since you don't ever get the feeling you are really getting into the character. But having said all that, the movie still works out great. The story is always intriguing and keeps you interest throughout. It's also really fast-going, which makes this a bit of a distant one when it comes down to its emotions and characters but at the same time keeps this movie consistently good to watch, since you never get bored with things. It's also true that it are the actors performance that keep the movie going and make this a great watch. Angela Bassett really shines and she deserved her Oscar nomination. Same goes for Laurence Fishburne as the abusive Ike Turner, who is perhaps the foremost reason why this movie remains such a good and interesting watch. His character, no matter how awful he is, is still what gives the story as well as the Tina Turner some real depth. Because lets face it, would Tina Turner's life had been interesting enough for a biopic if she had never met Ike? I really don't think so. But of course the movie does not only focus on her personal life but also her career. It's quite fascination to see how she started out and at several points at her career had to start all over again but every time came back stronger, as a performer and person as well. It's why I now have so much more respect for her after seeing this movie. I now kind of wished I would had gone to her concert when she was in town here a decade ago. Besides, I really don't think you have to be a fan of her music in order to enjoy and appreciate her incredible stage presence and performance. Same sort of goes for this movie. You really don't have to be that much in Tina Turner in order to really like and appreciate this movie. 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    This film is truly extraordinary. This is one of those films that you will not forget about. Angela Bassett portrayed Tina Turner perfectly in this movie. Whether you were a fan of Tina Turner's music or not you will feel some type of respect for her and what she went through after watching this film. She lived a life that not too many people were familiar with. This movie teaches you so much about her and what she went through and that celebrities aren't always as happy as they appear to be and that behind the scenes anything goes. Tina's husband Ike Turner, who was played by Laurence Fishburne, used and abused her in the movie. He initially got her started and made her a big star but he controlled all aspects of her musical career, and her life! He became obsessed with her and would beat her a lot. After years of being in this domestic violence filled relationship Tina finally came to her senses and left her, it took a lot of years because she was very gullible. This movie is so interesting and it will keep viewers captured all the way to the end because they want to figure out how it will end. Will she fight back? Will he kill her? Will she kill him? These were questions that were going through my mind as I sat and watched the film. This is one of my favorite films and although the movie reveals Tina's constant struggle with Ike, ironically the movie had it's funny moments. This is a must see. Excellent film 10/10.

    When this movie came out, I was about one year old. When my sister and I were little the only scenes we were allowed to watch were the performance scenes. As time went on, they were the only scenes I remembered. As I got older, I began to have this sudden urge to watch this movie again (the VHS we had once owned had gotten lost somehow). On my 16th birthday, I was given this movie on DVD as a gift. I suddenly realized why I wanted to see this movie again, and it instantly became my favorite movie of all-time. 'What's Love Got To Do With It' is the biopic of Tina Turner, mainly focusing on her turbulent marriage to Ike Turner. The acting is PERFECTION (Angela Bassett starred as Tina Turner, Laurence Fishburne starred as Ike Turner) and the entire movie was COMPELLING, CAPTIVATING, EXCITING, AND INSPIRING. Despite the fact that the two lead stars barely look like who they're portraying, and with a few 'unnecessarily altered' facts for dramatic effect, this movie is a must-see!

    What an incredible film! An inspirational tale of an amazing woman who triumphed against all adversity and quite insurmountable odds to become a truly great star of popular music and also found great spirituality... Quite amazing performances from Angela Basset and Laurence Fishburne. As in so many of these kind of movies, the performances distill the essence of the people they portray so that they are almost more their roles than the people themselves, if that is possible. What more can i say...? I recommend this highly.

    Do not mistake the script of a Hollywood movie for fact. Not a bad movie, actually, just not very accurate or fair to Ike. Annie Mae Bullock was not the innocent little country girl she's made out to be when she met Ike. Ike, in reality, was half Laurence Fishburne's size (and in a punch-up between him & Tina, my money'd be on Tina). And the movie seems to suggest that Ike spent every day of the week beating on Tina, while in reality he was always working: writing, rehearsing the band, recording, organizing tours etc. That is why the group was successful, while the movie seems to suggest that Tina was the only one with talent & Ike was nothing more than a parasite. Ike made much of music history what it is, scouting talent for the Sun & Modern labels for instance. The movie utterly destroyed his reputation & even now that he's dead, he'll never be remembered for his amazing work. Musicians & other close associates from the Ike & Tina days regularly dismiss this movie as a gross distortion of facts. Of course, that's what makes it a good movie - you can't build a story on facts.

    Recent years have seen a number of pop star biopics, such as "Ray", "Walk the Line" and "Dreamgirls", a fictionalised version of the story of Diana Ross and the Supremes. (I understand that a life of Marvin Gaye is to come in the near future). "What's Love Got to Do with It", based on Tina Turner's autobiography, was one of the earliest in this genre. "Ray" and "Walk the Line" both laid considerable emphasis on their subjects' early years. Like Ray Charles and Johnny Cash, Anna Mae Bullock (Tina's real name) was born in America's Deep South in the 1930s and grew up in poverty. Her birthplace, Nutbush, Tennessee, was later immortalised in her song "Nutbush City Limits". (Her promotion of this small village to city status was presumably a piece of sardonic humour). The film does not, however, dwell on her childhood at any length, although there is one scene in which the young Anna Mae is thrown out of her local church choir for singing with too much fervour. (Ironically, she was later to renounce Christianity in favour of Buddhism, and this is dealt with in the film, although we are left with the misleading impression that the Buddhist religion consists of little more than the attainment of inner peace through the repeated chanting of a phrase in a foreign language). There is a convention, observed by most showbiz biographies, that success doesn't come easily. The star must be shown battling against internal demons or external forces which hinder his or her rise to the top and then threaten to destroy his or her career. This convention may be something of a clich&eacute;, yet it is often a necessary one, needed to give dramatic force to narratives that might otherwise be bland and uninteresting. It is for this reason that I found the Jennifer Lopez film "Selena" vaguely unsatisfactory. Selena Quintanilla-Perez seemed to achieve success as easily as breathing and, as portrayed by Lopez, was so innocent and wholesome that the concept of internal demons was entirely foreign to her. Her murder in the final scenes- even though this is what happened to the real Selena- seemed like an ending tacked on from some entirely different movie. In this film the threat to Tina is not an internal demon but an external one, in the shape of her husband, mentor, and performing partner, Ike, The film concentrates largely on the first two decades of Tina's career, and especially on her marriage. Yet, in the early part of the film, Ike is not the villain of the piece. In the 1950s he was an established star in his own right, and the film describes how he met Anna Mae while she was living in St Louis in the late fifties, how he became first her lover, then her husband and how created her career as a performer. They were to win fame in the sixties as a husband-and-wife double-act, "Ike and Tina Turner". (Ike suggested that she take Tina as her stage name). As the film progresses, however, it becomes clear that Ike is an unstable personality with an uncontrollable temper, subject to fits of rage in which he abuses Tina both verbally and physically. Although he created her as a performer, he comes close to destroying her as a person. Eventually, after fifteen years Tina has had enough, and the marriage ends in divorce. The title is taken from another of her well-known songs, although it might also be taken as her comment on her marriage. What had love got to do with the way Ike treated her? The last part of the film deals with Tina's attempts to make a new career as a solo performer, but overlooks her long-standing relationship with her German partner Erwin Bach. Hollywood is often uncomfortable with the idea of mixed-race relationships, even real-life ones. Angela Bassett was very good at conveying the raw energy and sexual power of Tina's stage performances, although it is Tina's voice that we actually hear. I was, however, less impressed by her interpretation of the role in the rest of the film and was surprised that she was nominated for an Oscar, especially as there were some deserving performances that were overlooked (notably Michelle Pfeiffer in "The Age of Innocence"). Bassett's Tina, away from the stage or the recording studio, came across as too passive and willing to submit to Ike's demands, as well as a bit too saintly. Laurence Fishburne was better, bringing out both the Jekyll and the Hyde in Ike's character, both his charisma and his violent fury, although the film perhaps does not explain why their marriage should have lasted for so long. The film may have been based upon Tina's autobiography, but autobiographies are not always the most reliable sources of information, and this reliance on a single, partial, source means that "What's Love Got to Do with It", although a very watchable and at times powerful drama, ends up rather unbalanced, with too many black and white distinctions and too few shades of grey. 6/10

But having said all that, the movie still works out great. The story is always intriguing and keeps you interest throughout. It's also really fast-going, which makes this a bit of a distant one when it comes down to its emotions and characters but at the same time keeps this movie consistently good to watch, since you never get bored with things. It's also true that it are the actors performance that keep the movie going and make this a great watch. Angela Bassett really shines and she deserved her Oscar nomination. Same goes for Laurence Fishburne as the abusive Ike Turner, who is perhaps the foremost reason why this movie remains such a good and interesting watch. His character, no matter how awful he is, is still what gives the story as well as the Tina Turner some real depth. Because lets face it, would Tina Turner's life had been interesting enough for a biopic if she had never met Ike? I really don't think so. But of course the movie does not only focus on her personal life but also her career. It's quite fascination to see how she started out and at several points at her career had to start all over again but every time came back stronger, as a performer and person as well. It's why I now have so much more respect for her after seeing this movie. I now kind of wished I would had gone to her concert when she was in town here a decade ago. Besides, I really don't think you have to be a fan of her music in order to enjoy and appreciate her incredible stage presence and performance. Same sort of goes for this movie. You really don't have to be that much in Tina Turner in order to really like and appreciate this movie. 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    This film is truly extraordinary. This is one of those films that you will not forget about. Angela Bassett portrayed Tina Turner perfectly in this movie. Whether you were a fan of Tina Turner's music or not you will feel some type of respect for her and what she went through after watching this film. She lived a life that not too many people were familiar with. This movie teaches you so much about her and what she went through and that celebrities aren't always as happy as they appear to be and that behind the scenes anything goes. Tina's husband Ike Turner, who was played by Laurence Fishburne, used and abused her in the movie. He initially got her started and made her a big star but he controlled all aspects of her musical career, and her life! He became obsessed with her and would beat her a lot. After years of being in this domestic violence filled relationship Tina finally came to her senses and left her, it took a lot of years because she was very gullible. This movie is so interesting and it will keep viewers captured all the way to the end because they want to figure out how it will end. Will she fight back? Will he kill her? Will she kill him? These were questions that were going through my mind as I sat and watched the film. This is one of my favorite films and although the movie reveals Tina's constant struggle with Ike, ironically the movie had it's funny moments. This is a must see. Excellent film 10/10.

    When this movie came out, I was about one year old. When my sister and I were little the only scenes we were allowed to watch were the performance scenes. As time went on, they were the only scenes I remembered. As I got older, I began to have this sudden urge to watch this movie again (the VHS we had once owned had gotten lost somehow). On my 16th birthday, I was given this movie on DVD as a gift. I suddenly realized why I wanted to see this movie again, and it instantly became my favorite movie of all-time. 'What's Love Got To Do With It' is the biopic of Tina Turner, mainly focusing on her turbulent marriage to Ike Turner. The acting is PERFECTION (Angela Bassett starred as Tina Turner, Laurence Fishburne starred as Ike Turner) and the entire movie was COMPELLING, CAPTIVATING, EXCITING, AND INSPIRING. Despite the fact that the two lead stars barely look like who they're portraying, and with a few 'unnecessarily altered' facts for dramatic effect, this movie is a must-see!

    What an incredible film! An inspirational tale of an amazing woman who triumphed against all adversity and quite insurmountable odds to become a truly great star of popular music and also found great spirituality... Quite amazing performances from Angela Basset and Laurence Fishburne. As in so many of these kind of movies, the performances distill the essence of the people they portray so that they are almost more their roles than the people themselves, if that is possible. What more can i say...? I recommend this highly.

    Do not mistake the script of a Hollywood movie for fact. Not a bad movie, actually, just not very accurate or fair to Ike. Annie Mae Bullock was not the innocent little country girl she's made out to be when she met Ike. Ike, in reality, was half Laurence Fishburne's size (and in a punch-up between him & Tina, my money'd be on Tina). And the movie seems to suggest that Ike spent every day of the week beating on Tina, while in reality he was always working: writing, rehearsing the band, recording, organizing tours etc. That is why the group was successful, while the movie seems to suggest that Tina was the only one with talent & Ike was nothing more than a parasite. Ike made much of music history what it is, scouting talent for the Sun & Modern labels for instance. The movie utterly destroyed his reputation & even now that he's dead, he'll never be remembered for his amazing work. Musicians & other close associates from the Ike & Tina days regularly dismiss this movie as a gross distortion of facts. Of course, that's what makes it a good movie - you can't build a story on facts.

    Recent years have seen a number of pop star biopics, such as "Ray", "Walk the Line" and "Dreamgirls", a fictionalised version of the story of Diana Ross and the Supremes. (I understand that a life of Marvin Gaye is to come in the near future). "What's Love Got to Do with It", based on Tina Turner's autobiography, was one of the earliest in this genre. "Ray" and "Walk the Line" both laid considerable emphasis on their subjects' early years. Like Ray Charles and Johnny Cash, Anna Mae Bullock (Tina's real name) was born in America's Deep South in the 1930s and grew up in poverty. Her birthplace, Nutbush, Tennessee, was later immortalised in her song "Nutbush City Limits". (Her promotion of this small village to city status was presumably a piece of sardonic humour). The film does not, however, dwell on her childhood at any length, although there is one scene in which the young Anna Mae is thrown out of her local church choir for singing with too much fervour. (Ironically, she was later to renounce Christianity in favour of Buddhism, and this is dealt with in the film, although we are left with the misleading impression that the Buddhist religion consists of little more than the attainment of inner peace through the repeated chanting of a phrase in a foreign language). There is a convention, observed by most showbiz biographies, that success doesn't come easily. The star must be shown battling against internal demons or external forces which hinder his or her rise to the top and then threaten to destroy his or her career. This convention may be something of a clich&eacute;, yet it is often a necessary one, needed to give dramatic force to narratives that might otherwise be bland and uninteresting. It is for this reason that I found the Jennifer Lopez film "Selena" vaguely unsatisfactory. Selena Quintanilla-Perez seemed to achieve success as easily as breathing and, as portrayed by Lopez, was so innocent and wholesome that the concept of internal demons was entirely foreign to her. Her murder in the final scenes- even though this is what happened to the real Selena- seemed like an ending tacked on from some entirely different movie. In this film the threat to Tina is not an internal demon but an external one, in the shape of her husband, mentor, and performing partner, Ike, The film concentrates largely on the first two decades of Tina's career, and especially on her marriage. Yet, in the early part of the film, Ike is not the villain of the piece. In the 1950s he was an established star in his own right, and the film describes how he met Anna Mae while she was living in St Louis in the late fifties, how he became first her lover, then her husband and how created her career as a performer. They were to win fame in the sixties as a husband-and-wife double-act, "Ike and Tina Turner". (Ike suggested that she take Tina as her stage name). As the film progresses, however, it becomes clear that Ike is an unstable personality with an uncontrollable temper, subject to fits of rage in which he abuses Tina both verbally and physically. Although he created her as a performer, he comes close to destroying her as a person. Eventually, after fifteen years Tina has had enough, and the marriage ends in divorce. The title is taken from another of her well-known songs, although it might also be taken as her comment on her marriage. What had love got to do with the way Ike treated her? The last part of the film deals with Tina's attempts to make a new career as a solo performer, but overlooks her long-standing relationship with her German partner Erwin Bach. Hollywood is often uncomfortable with the idea of mixed-race relationships, even real-life ones. Angela Bassett was very good at conveying the raw energy and sexual power of Tina's stage performances, although it is Tina's voice that we actually hear. I was, however, less impressed by her interpretation of the role in the rest of the film and was surprised that she was nominated for an Oscar, especially as there were some deserving performances that were overlooked (notably Michelle Pfeiffer in "The Age of Innocence"). Bassett's Tina, away from the stage or the recording studio, came across as too passive and willing to submit to Ike's demands, as well as a bit too saintly. Laurence Fishburne was better, bringing out both the Jekyll and the Hyde in Ike's character, both his charisma and his violent fury, although the film perhaps does not explain why their marriage should have lasted for so long. The film may have been based upon Tina's autobiography, but autobiographies are not always the most reliable sources of information, and this reliance on a single, partial, source means that "What's Love Got to Do with It", although a very watchable and at times powerful drama, ends up rather unbalanced, with too many black and white distinctions and too few shades of grey. 6/10

    What's Love Got to Do With It If it weren't for females, record labels would have to rely solely on money and cocaine to entice potential male acts. However, the male singer in this biography needs a woman to complete his act. Abandoned by her family, Anna Mae (Angela Bassett) grows up with nothing but her unorthodox singing voice to keep her company. In her teens, she auditions for local bandleader/lothario Ike (Laurence Fishburne), who is impressed by her pipes. Joining him and his band under the moniker Tina, Anna Mae begins banging out the hits, while her new husband begins banging on her. Under Ike's thumb, Tina is unable to branch out and become the star she's destined to be. Based on Tina Turner's biography, WLGTDWI is a superbly acted, heartbreaking tale of overcoming domestic abuse in an era of blind eyes. Fortunately, domestic violence in today's music has been restricted to the Top 40 list. (Green Light)

    Personally I'm not especially keen on this type of movie; movies packed with music numbers. But after all, it is the grand old lady Tina Turner we are talking about; she deserves more than something average. I really did like her songs in the 80s when she got rid of her abusive husband Ike. Her voice was strong and with a great personality. The relationship between Ike and Tina was almost made for a movie; there is drama, violence, and music. The title really says it all. Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne are stunning as the main characters. Bassett got the nearly impossible job to portrait one of the most remarkable female artists in music history especially when it comes to the body language of Tina. However, Angela Bassett did it very well. Also in scenes with playback I could hardly notice it was an actor imitating a great rock star. Overall a very good movie, but like I said; too many music scenes that I felt interrupted the story. But most of the songs are well known - and good!

    It took me a while (18 years), but at my wife's urging I finally got round to watching this superb film about the harrowing life of popular singer Tina Turner. The film is brilliantly directed by the late Brian Gibson, whose previous film in 1991 had been the life story of another famous black singer, Josephine Baker. But the film sizzles and fascinates primarily because of the sensational performance of Angela Bassett as Tina Turner. She is simply a knock-out. I presume her singing may have been dubbed by Turner herself. But whether she sang or not, her performance was dazzling, full of charm and sweetness as well as conveying all the heartache, emotional confusion and weakness, joys and sorrows. This is really a superior biopic, and the true story has plenty to tell! One should not neglect to mention that the little girl who plays Tina as a child, Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly, is also superb. (She has grown up and appeared now in 42 films.) Tina Turner had a rough time in life, and it is shown very vividly in this film. She married an egocentric, violent, borderline psychopath named Ike Turner (died 2007), who beat her up regularly for years. Men who beat up women are really sick, but women who let men beat them up year in and year out without leaving them are sick too. In the film her excuse for not leaving Ike is said to be because she 'can't abandon family', due to the trauma of her horrible mother having abandoned her as a child. That does not wash. But let us not heap blame upon the ravaged Tina Turner for the horrors she endured and for her determination over so many years to remain a victim rather than save herself. At last she did summon up the courage to save herself, and she also went on to reinvent herself. So this is a story of heroic endurance and dedication to her art by a girl who was born to sing. If she suffered a lot along the way, well, that's life. But the songs go on.

    Angela Bassett, as Tina Turner asks the musical question "What's Love Got to Do with It" in this 1993 film also starring Laurence Fishburne, Jenifer Lewis, and Khandi Alexander. The film tells the story of Tina Turner's childhood as Anna Mae Bullock her move to St. Louis after her grandmother's death to live with her mother, her meeting Ike Turner at a nightclub, her subsequent singing with Ike's band, their marriage and divorce. By necessity, biopics have to leave out people and incidents, often combining several incidents into one or skipping several steps. In no way does a knowledge of Tina Turner''s life detract from the impact of this film. It's a story of a woman's determination, beating the odds, suffering, perseverance and ultimate success. Ike's and Tina's marriage was pretty much a horror show. Ike was always controlling, to the detriment of his own career, and as he turned to drugs, his abuse of Tina escalated. The most stunning scene in the film (besides the performances, which are fantastic) occurs when the couple fights in a limo en route to a hotel. Ike becomes physical; Tina has discovered Buddhism and finally gets the courage to fight back. A bloody mess, she runs away from him with only 36 cents in her purse. Angela Bassett gives a searing, electrifying performance as Turner. Her sinewy body is a great match for Turner's, and she uses it to perfection in replicating Turner's performances (Turner's voice is used on the soundtrack). She shows the star's vulnerability, fear, and internal strength throughout. Bassett is matched by Laurence Fishburne's terrifying performance as Ike. Fishburne seethes with manipulation and anger, even in scenes where he's being "nice." When Ike loses his temper, you can see how he can't stop and the violence just gets worth. A brilliant performance. A must see. The latter part of Turner's life is not explored, but while she always remained popular in Europe, it was a long time before she could get a recording contract here after some failed recordings. Today she remains one of the greatest singing stars ever. But there were lots of valleys in between.

    There is plenty wrong with this movie as a biopic, however when you look at it as purely being a movie, it is a surprisingly great one. I never really considered Tina Turner to be such a good subject for a biopic, especially not in the '90's. First of all she was still alive and at an all time popular height and second of all, she in my opinion is not a that big star, when compared to all other people who get a biopic made about them. But I must say that after seeing this movie i have a whole lot more respect for her by now and I was definitely wrong about her career and life not being worthy or interesting enough for making a movie about it. The movie was a positive surprise. But nevertheless there still is plenty wrong with it as a biopic. It suffers from lots of the stuff other genre movies often suffer from. Thing with biopics often is that you try to capture a persons entire life and career into a 2 hour long movie. This means some stuff will often get rushed and shoved down your throat. You often just have to take things for granted, without them ever getting developed properly and convincing enough, like would be the case in a normal film drama about a normal average, every day person. And yes, this happens quite a lot in this movie. It often makes some very sudden jumps with its story and make jumps in time as well. We just never get to see how popular Tina Tuner is with the public and some things seem to happen very randomly in this movie, just because they happened in her real life as well. It at times feels like some stuff really got crow-bared into the film. They movie because of that also feels quite distant at times as a biopic, since you don't ever get the feeling you are really getting into the character. But having said all that, the movie still works out great. The story is always intriguing and keeps you interest throughout. It's also really fast-going, which makes this a bit of a distant one when it comes down to its emotions and characters but at the same time keeps this movie consistently good to watch, since you never get bored with things. It's also true that it are the actors performance that keep the movie going and make this a great watch. Angela Bassett really shines and she deserved her Oscar nomination. Same goes for Laurence Fishburne as the abusive Ike Turner, who is perhaps the foremost reason why this movie remains such a good and interesting watch. His character, no matter how awful he is, is still what gives the story as well as the Tina Turner some real depth. Because lets face it, would Tina Turner's life had been interesting enough for a biopic if she had never met Ike? I really don't think so. But of course the movie does not only focus on her personal life but also her career. It's quite fascination to see how she started out and at several points at her career had to start all over again but every time came back stronger, as a performer and person as well. It's why I now have so much more respect for her after seeing this movie. I now kind of wished I would had gone to her concert when she was in town here a decade ago. Besides, I really don't think you have to be a fan of her music in order to enjoy and appreciate her incredible stage presence and performance. Same sort of goes for this movie. You really don't have to be that much in Tina Turner in order to really like and appreciate this movie. 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

The film may have been based upon Tina's autobiography, but autobiographies are not always the most reliable sources of information, and this reliance on a single, partial, source means that "What's Love Got to Do with It", although a very watchable and at times powerful drama, ends up rather unbalanced, with too many black and white distinctions and too few shades of grey. 6/10

    What's Love Got to Do With It If it weren't for females, record labels would have to rely solely on money and cocaine to entice potential male acts. However, the male singer in this biography needs a woman to complete his act. Abandoned by her family, Anna Mae (Angela Bassett) grows up with nothing but her unorthodox singing voice to keep her company. In her teens, she auditions for local bandleader/lothario Ike (Laurence Fishburne), who is impressed by her pipes. Joining him and his band under the moniker Tina, Anna Mae begins banging out the hits, while her new husband begins banging on her. Under Ike's thumb, Tina is unable to branch out and become the star she's destined to be. Based on Tina Turner's biography, WLGTDWI is a superbly acted, heartbreaking tale of overcoming domestic abuse in an era of blind eyes. Fortunately, domestic violence in today's music has been restricted to the Top 40 list. (Green Light)

    Personally I'm not especially keen on this type of movie; movies packed with music numbers. But after all, it is the grand old lady Tina Turner we are talking about; she deserves more than something average. I really did like her songs in the 80s when she got rid of her abusive husband Ike. Her voice was strong and with a great personality. The relationship between Ike and Tina was almost made for a movie; there is drama, violence, and music. The title really says it all. Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne are stunning as the main characters. Bassett got the nearly impossible job to portrait one of the most remarkable female artists in music history especially when it comes to the body language of Tina. However, Angela Bassett did it very well. Also in scenes with playback I could hardly notice it was an actor imitating a great rock star. Overall a very good movie, but like I said; too many music scenes that I felt interrupted the story. But most of the songs are well known - and good!

    It took me a while (18 years), but at my wife's urging I finally got round to watching this superb film about the harrowing life of popular singer Tina Turner. The film is brilliantly directed by the late Brian Gibson, whose previous film in 1991 had been the life story of another famous black singer, Josephine Baker. But the film sizzles and fascinates primarily because of the sensational performance of Angela Bassett as Tina Turner. She is simply a knock-out. I presume her singing may have been dubbed by Turner herself. But whether she sang or not, her performance was dazzling, full of charm and sweetness as well as conveying all the heartache, emotional confusion and weakness, joys and sorrows. This is really a superior biopic, and the true story has plenty to tell! One should not neglect to mention that the little girl who plays Tina as a child, Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly, is also superb. (She has grown up and appeared now in 42 films.) Tina Turner had a rough time in life, and it is shown very vividly in this film. She married an egocentric, violent, borderline psychopath named Ike Turner (died 2007), who beat her up regularly for years. Men who beat up women are really sick, but women who let men beat them up year in and year out without leaving them are sick too. In the film her excuse for not leaving Ike is said to be because she 'can't abandon family', due to the trauma of her horrible mother having abandoned her as a child. That does not wash. But let us not heap blame upon the ravaged Tina Turner for the horrors she endured and for her determination over so many years to remain a victim rather than save herself. At last she did summon up the courage to save herself, and she also went on to reinvent herself. So this is a story of heroic endurance and dedication to her art by a girl who was born to sing. If she suffered a lot along the way, well, that's life. But the songs go on.

    Angela Bassett, as Tina Turner asks the musical question "What's Love Got to Do with It" in this 1993 film also starring Laurence Fishburne, Jenifer Lewis, and Khandi Alexander. The film tells the story of Tina Turner's childhood as Anna Mae Bullock her move to St. Louis after her grandmother's death to live with her mother, her meeting Ike Turner at a nightclub, her subsequent singing with Ike's band, their marriage and divorce. By necessity, biopics have to leave out people and incidents, often combining several incidents into one or skipping several steps. In no way does a knowledge of Tina Turner''s life detract from the impact of this film. It's a story of a woman's determination, beating the odds, suffering, perseverance and ultimate success. Ike's and Tina's marriage was pretty much a horror show. Ike was always controlling, to the detriment of his own career, and as he turned to drugs, his abuse of Tina escalated. The most stunning scene in the film (besides the performances, which are fantastic) occurs when the couple fights in a limo en route to a hotel. Ike becomes physical; Tina has discovered Buddhism and finally gets the courage to fight back. A bloody mess, she runs away from him with only 36 cents in her purse. Angela Bassett gives a searing, electrifying performance as Turner. Her sinewy body is a great match for Turner's, and she uses it to perfection in replicating Turner's performances (Turner's voice is used on the soundtrack). She shows the star's vulnerability, fear, and internal strength throughout. Bassett is matched by Laurence Fishburne's terrifying performance as Ike. Fishburne seethes with manipulation and anger, even in scenes where he's being "nice." When Ike loses his temper, you can see how he can't stop and the violence just gets worth. A brilliant performance. A must see. The latter part of Turner's life is not explored, but while she always remained popular in Europe, it was a long time before she could get a recording contract here after some failed recordings. Today she remains one of the greatest singing stars ever. But there were lots of valleys in between.

    There is plenty wrong with this movie as a biopic, however when you look at it as purely being a movie, it is a surprisingly great one. I never really considered Tina Turner to be such a good subject for a biopic, especially not in the '90's. First of all she was still alive and at an all time popular height and second of all, she in my opinion is not a that big star, when compared to all other people who get a biopic made about them. But I must say that after seeing this movie i have a whole lot more respect for her by now and I was definitely wrong about her career and life not being worthy or interesting enough for making a movie about it. The movie was a positive surprise. But nevertheless there still is plenty wrong with it as a biopic. It suffers from lots of the stuff other genre movies often suffer from. Thing with biopics often is that you try to capture a persons entire life and career into a 2 hour long movie. This means some stuff will often get rushed and shoved down your throat. You often just have to take things for granted, without them ever getting developed properly and convincing enough, like would be the case in a normal film drama about a normal average, every day person. And yes, this happens quite a lot in this movie. It often makes some very sudden jumps with its story and make jumps in time as well. We just never get to see how popular Tina Tuner is with the public and some things seem to happen very randomly in this movie, just because they happened in her real life as well. It at times feels like some stuff really got crow-bared into the film. They movie because of that also feels quite distant at times as a biopic, since you don't ever get the feeling you are really getting into the character. But having said all that, the movie still works out great. The story is always intriguing and keeps you interest throughout. It's also really fast-going, which makes this a bit of a distant one when it comes down to its emotions and characters but at the same time keeps this movie consistently good to watch, since you never get bored with things. It's also true that it are the actors performance that keep the movie going and make this a great watch. Angela Bassett really shines and she deserved her Oscar nomination. Same goes for Laurence Fishburne as the abusive Ike Turner, who is perhaps the foremost reason why this movie remains such a good and interesting watch. His character, no matter how awful he is, is still what gives the story as well as the Tina Turner some real depth. Because lets face it, would Tina Turner's life had been interesting enough for a biopic if she had never met Ike? I really don't think so. But of course the movie does not only focus on her personal life but also her career. It's quite fascination to see how she started out and at several points at her career had to start all over again but every time came back stronger, as a performer and person as well. It's why I now have so much more respect for her after seeing this movie. I now kind of wished I would had gone to her concert when she was in town here a decade ago. Besides, I really don't think you have to be a fan of her music in order to enjoy and appreciate her incredible stage presence and performance. Same sort of goes for this movie. You really don't have to be that much in Tina Turner in order to really like and appreciate this movie. 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    This film is truly extraordinary. This is one of those films that you will not forget about. Angela Bassett portrayed Tina Turner perfectly in this movie. Whether you were a fan of Tina Turner's music or not you will feel some type of respect for her and what she went through after watching this film. She lived a life that not too many people were familiar with. This movie teaches you so much about her and what she went through and that celebrities aren't always as happy as they appear to be and that behind the scenes anything goes. Tina's husband Ike Turner, who was played by Laurence Fishburne, used and abused her in the movie. He initially got her started and made her a big star but he controlled all aspects of her musical career, and her life! He became obsessed with her and would beat her a lot. After years of being in this domestic violence filled relationship Tina finally came to her senses and left her, it took a lot of years because she was very gullible. This movie is so interesting and it will keep viewers captured all the way to the end because they want to figure out how it will end. Will she fight back? Will he kill her? Will she kill him? These were questions that were going through my mind as I sat and watched the film. This is one of my favorite films and although the movie reveals Tina's constant struggle with Ike, ironically the movie had it's funny moments. This is a must see. Excellent film 10/10.

    When this movie came out, I was about one year old. When my sister and I were little the only scenes we were allowed to watch were the performance scenes. As time went on, they were the only scenes I remembered. As I got older, I began to have this sudden urge to watch this movie again (the VHS we had once owned had gotten lost somehow). On my 16th birthday, I was given this movie on DVD as a gift. I suddenly realized why I wanted to see this movie again, and it instantly became my favorite movie of all-time. 'What's Love Got To Do With It' is the biopic of Tina Turner, mainly focusing on her turbulent marriage to Ike Turner. The acting is PERFECTION (Angela Bassett starred as Tina Turner, Laurence Fishburne starred as Ike Turner) and the entire movie was COMPELLING, CAPTIVATING, EXCITING, AND INSPIRING. Despite the fact that the two lead stars barely look like who they're portraying, and with a few 'unnecessarily altered' facts for dramatic effect, this movie is a must-see!

    What an incredible film! An inspirational tale of an amazing woman who triumphed against all adversity and quite insurmountable odds to become a truly great star of popular music and also found great spirituality... Quite amazing performances from Angela Basset and Laurence Fishburne. As in so many of these kind of movies, the performances distill the essence of the people they portray so that they are almost more their roles than the people themselves, if that is possible. What more can i say...? I recommend this highly.

    Do not mistake the script of a Hollywood movie for fact. Not a bad movie, actually, just not very accurate or fair to Ike. Annie Mae Bullock was not the innocent little country girl she's made out to be when she met Ike. Ike, in reality, was half Laurence Fishburne's size (and in a punch-up between him & Tina, my money'd be on Tina). And the movie seems to suggest that Ike spent every day of the week beating on Tina, while in reality he was always working: writing, rehearsing the band, recording, organizing tours etc. That is why the group was successful, while the movie seems to suggest that Tina was the only one with talent & Ike was nothing more than a parasite. Ike made much of music history what it is, scouting talent for the Sun & Modern labels for instance. The movie utterly destroyed his reputation & even now that he's dead, he'll never be remembered for his amazing work. Musicians & other close associates from the Ike & Tina days regularly dismiss this movie as a gross distortion of facts. Of course, that's what makes it a good movie - you can't build a story on facts.

    Recent years have seen a number of pop star biopics, such as "Ray", "Walk the Line" and "Dreamgirls", a fictionalised version of the story of Diana Ross and the Supremes. (I understand that a life of Marvin Gaye is to come in the near future). "What's Love Got to Do with It", based on Tina Turner's autobiography, was one of the earliest in this genre. "Ray" and "Walk the Line" both laid considerable emphasis on their subjects' early years. Like Ray Charles and Johnny Cash, Anna Mae Bullock (Tina's real name) was born in America's Deep South in the 1930s and grew up in poverty. Her birthplace, Nutbush, Tennessee, was later immortalised in her song "Nutbush City Limits". (Her promotion of this small village to city status was presumably a piece of sardonic humour). The film does not, however, dwell on her childhood at any length, although there is one scene in which the young Anna Mae is thrown out of her local church choir for singing with too much fervour. (Ironically, she was later to renounce Christianity in favour of Buddhism, and this is dealt with in the film, although we are left with the misleading impression that the Buddhist religion consists of little more than the attainment of inner peace through the repeated chanting of a phrase in a foreign language). There is a convention, observed by most showbiz biographies, that success doesn't come easily. The star must be shown battling against internal demons or external forces which hinder his or her rise to the top and then threaten to destroy his or her career. This convention may be something of a clich&eacute;, yet it is often a necessary one, needed to give dramatic force to narratives that might otherwise be bland and uninteresting. It is for this reason that I found the Jennifer Lopez film "Selena" vaguely unsatisfactory. Selena Quintanilla-Perez seemed to achieve success as easily as breathing and, as portrayed by Lopez, was so innocent and wholesome that the concept of internal demons was entirely foreign to her. Her murder in the final scenes- even though this is what happened to the real Selena- seemed like an ending tacked on from some entirely different movie. In this film the threat to Tina is not an internal demon but an external one, in the shape of her husband, mentor, and performing partner, Ike, The film concentrates largely on the first two decades of Tina's career, and especially on her marriage. Yet, in the early part of the film, Ike is not the villain of the piece. In the 1950s he was an established star in his own right, and the film describes how he met Anna Mae while she was living in St Louis in the late fifties, how he became first her lover, then her husband and how created her career as a performer. They were to win fame in the sixties as a husband-and-wife double-act, "Ike and Tina Turner". (Ike suggested that she take Tina as her stage name). As the film progresses, however, it becomes clear that Ike is an unstable personality with an uncontrollable temper, subject to fits of rage in which he abuses Tina both verbally and physically. Although he created her as a performer, he comes close to destroying her as a person. Eventually, after fifteen years Tina has had enough, and the marriage ends in divorce. The title is taken from another of her well-known songs, although it might also be taken as her comment on her marriage. What had love got to do with the way Ike treated her? The last part of the film deals with Tina's attempts to make a new career as a solo performer, but overlooks her long-standing relationship with her German partner Erwin Bach. Hollywood is often uncomfortable with the idea of mixed-race relationships, even real-life ones. Angela Bassett was very good at conveying the raw energy and sexual power of Tina's stage performances, although it is Tina's voice that we actually hear. I was, however, less impressed by her interpretation of the role in the rest of the film and was surprised that she was nominated for an Oscar, especially as there were some deserving performances that were overlooked (notably Michelle Pfeiffer in "The Age of Innocence"). Bassett's Tina, away from the stage or the recording studio, came across as too passive and willing to submit to Ike's demands, as well as a bit too saintly. Laurence Fishburne was better, bringing out both the Jekyll and the Hyde in Ike's character, both his charisma and his violent fury, although the film perhaps does not explain why their marriage should have lasted for so long. The film may have been based upon Tina's autobiography, but autobiographies are not always the most reliable sources of information, and this reliance on a single, partial, source means that "What's Love Got to Do with It", although a very watchable and at times powerful drama, ends up rather unbalanced, with too many black and white distinctions and too few shades of grey. 6/10

    This film is truly extraordinary. This is one of those films that you will not forget about. Angela Bassett portrayed Tina Turner perfectly in this movie. Whether you were a fan of Tina Turner's music or not you will feel some type of respect for her and what she went through after watching this film. She lived a life that not too many people were familiar with. This movie teaches you so much about her and what she went through and that celebrities aren't always as happy as they appear to be and that behind the scenes anything goes. Tina's husband Ike Turner, who was played by Laurence Fishburne, used and abused her in the movie. He initially got her started and made her a big star but he controlled all aspects of her musical career, and her life! He became obsessed with her and would beat her a lot. After years of being in this domestic violence filled relationship Tina finally came to her senses and left her, it took a lot of years because she was very gullible. This movie is so interesting and it will keep viewers captured all the way to the end because they want to figure out how it will end. Will she fight back? Will he kill her? Will she kill him? These were questions that were going through my mind as I sat and watched the film. This is one of my favorite films and although the movie reveals Tina's constant struggle with Ike, ironically the movie had it's funny moments. This is a must see. Excellent film 10/10.

    When this movie came out, I was about one year old. When my sister and I were little the only scenes we were allowed to watch were the performance scenes. As time went on, they were the only scenes I remembered. As I got older, I began to have this sudden urge to watch this movie again (the VHS we had once owned had gotten lost somehow). On my 16th birthday, I was given this movie on DVD as a gift. I suddenly realized why I wanted to see this movie again, and it instantly became my favorite movie of all-time. 'What's Love Got To Do With It' is the biopic of Tina Turner, mainly focusing on her turbulent marriage to Ike Turner. The acting is PERFECTION (Angela Bassett starred as Tina Turner, Laurence Fishburne starred as Ike Turner) and the entire movie was COMPELLING, CAPTIVATING, EXCITING, AND INSPIRING. Despite the fact that the two lead stars barely look like who they're portraying, and with a few 'unnecessarily altered' facts for dramatic effect, this movie is a must-see!

    What an incredible film! An inspirational tale of an amazing woman who triumphed against all adversity and quite insurmountable odds to become a truly great star of popular music and also found great spirituality... Quite amazing performances from Angela Basset and Laurence Fishburne. As in so many of these kind of movies, the performances distill the essence of the people they portray so that they are almost more their roles than the people themselves, if that is possible. What more can i say...? I recommend this highly.

    Do not mistake the script of a Hollywood movie for fact. Not a bad movie, actually, just not very accurate or fair to Ike. Annie Mae Bullock was not the innocent little country girl she's made out to be when she met Ike. Ike, in reality, was half Laurence Fishburne's size (and in a punch-up between him & Tina, my money'd be on Tina). And the movie seems to suggest that Ike spent every day of the week beating on Tina, while in reality he was always working: writing, rehearsing the band, recording, organizing tours etc. That is why the group was successful, while the movie seems to suggest that Tina was the only one with talent & Ike was nothing more than a parasite. Ike made much of music history what it is, scouting talent for the Sun & Modern labels for instance. The movie utterly destroyed his reputation & even now that he's dead, he'll never be remembered for his amazing work. Musicians & other close associates from the Ike & Tina days regularly dismiss this movie as a gross distortion of facts. Of course, that's what makes it a good movie - you can't build a story on facts.

    Recent years have seen a number of pop star biopics, such as "Ray", "Walk the Line" and "Dreamgirls", a fictionalised version of the story of Diana Ross and the Supremes. (I understand that a life of Marvin Gaye is to come in the near future). "What's Love Got to Do with It", based on Tina Turner's autobiography, was one of the earliest in this genre. "Ray" and "Walk the Line" both laid considerable emphasis on their subjects' early years. Like Ray Charles and Johnny Cash, Anna Mae Bullock (Tina's real name) was born in America's Deep South in the 1930s and grew up in poverty. Her birthplace, Nutbush, Tennessee, was later immortalised in her song "Nutbush City Limits". (Her promotion of this small village to city status was presumably a piece of sardonic humour). The film does not, however, dwell on her childhood at any length, although there is one scene in which the young Anna Mae is thrown out of her local church choir for singing with too much fervour. (Ironically, she was later to renounce Christianity in favour of Buddhism, and this is dealt with in the film, although we are left with the misleading impression that the Buddhist religion consists of little more than the attainment of inner peace through the repeated chanting of a phrase in a foreign language). There is a convention, observed by most showbiz biographies, that success doesn't come easily. The star must be shown battling against internal demons or external forces which hinder his or her rise to the top and then threaten to destroy his or her career. This convention may be something of a clich&eacute;, yet it is often a necessary one, needed to give dramatic force to narratives that might otherwise be bland and uninteresting. It is for this reason that I found the Jennifer Lopez film "Selena" vaguely unsatisfactory. Selena Quintanilla-Perez seemed to achieve success as easily as breathing and, as portrayed by Lopez, was so innocent and wholesome that the concept of internal demons was entirely foreign to her. Her murder in the final scenes- even though this is what happened to the real Selena- seemed like an ending tacked on from some entirely different movie. In this film the threat to Tina is not an internal demon but an external one, in the shape of her husband, mentor, and performing partner, Ike, The film concentrates largely on the first two decades of Tina's career, and especially on her marriage. Yet, in the early part of the film, Ike is not the villain of the piece. In the 1950s he was an established star in his own right, and the film describes how he met Anna Mae while she was living in St Louis in the late fifties, how he became first her lover, then her husband and how created her career as a performer. They were to win fame in the sixties as a husband-and-wife double-act, "Ike and Tina Turner". (Ike suggested that she take Tina as her stage name). As the film progresses, however, it becomes clear that Ike is an unstable personality with an uncontrollable temper, subject to fits of rage in which he abuses Tina both verbally and physically. Although he created her as a performer, he comes close to destroying her as a person. Eventually, after fifteen years Tina has had enough, and the marriage ends in divorce. The title is taken from another of her well-known songs, although it might also be taken as her comment on her marriage. What had love got to do with the way Ike treated her? The last part of the film deals with Tina's attempts to make a new career as a solo performer, but overlooks her long-standing relationship with her German partner Erwin Bach. Hollywood is often uncomfortable with the idea of mixed-race relationships, even real-life ones. Angela Bassett was very good at conveying the raw energy and sexual power of Tina's stage performances, although it is Tina's voice that we actually hear. I was, however, less impressed by her interpretation of the role in the rest of the film and was surprised that she was nominated for an Oscar, especially as there were some deserving performances that were overlooked (notably Michelle Pfeiffer in "The Age of Innocence"). Bassett's Tina, away from the stage or the recording studio, came across as too passive and willing to submit to Ike's demands, as well as a bit too saintly. Laurence Fishburne was better, bringing out both the Jekyll and the Hyde in Ike's character, both his charisma and his violent fury, although the film perhaps does not explain why their marriage should have lasted for so long. The film may have been based upon Tina's autobiography, but autobiographies are not always the most reliable sources of information, and this reliance on a single, partial, source means that "What's Love Got to Do with It", although a very watchable and at times powerful drama, ends up rather unbalanced, with too many black and white distinctions and too few shades of grey. 6/10

    What's Love Got to Do With It If it weren't for females, record labels would have to rely solely on money and cocaine to entice potential male acts. However, the male singer in this biography needs a woman to complete his act. Abandoned by her family, Anna Mae (Angela Bassett) grows up with nothing but her unorthodox singing voice to keep her company. In her teens, she auditions for local bandleader/lothario Ike (Laurence Fishburne), who is impressed by her pipes. Joining him and his band under the moniker Tina, Anna Mae begins banging out the hits, while her new husband begins banging on her. Under Ike's thumb, Tina is unable to branch out and become the star she's destined to be. Based on Tina Turner's biography, WLGTDWI is a superbly acted, heartbreaking tale of overcoming domestic abuse in an era of blind eyes. Fortunately, domestic violence in today's music has been restricted to the Top 40 list. (Green Light)

    Personally I'm not especially keen on this type of movie; movies packed with music numbers. But after all, it is the grand old lady Tina Turner we are talking about; she deserves more than something average. I really did like her songs in the 80s when she got rid of her abusive husband Ike. Her voice was strong and with a great personality. The relationship between Ike and Tina was almost made for a movie; there is drama, violence, and music. The title really says it all. Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne are stunning as the main characters. Bassett got the nearly impossible job to portrait one of the most remarkable female artists in music history especially when it comes to the body language of Tina. However, Angela Bassett did it very well. Also in scenes with playback I could hardly notice it was an actor imitating a great rock star. Overall a very good movie, but like I said; too many music scenes that I felt interrupted the story. But most of the songs are well known - and good!

    It took me a while (18 years), but at my wife's urging I finally got round to watching this superb film about the harrowing life of popular singer Tina Turner. The film is brilliantly directed by the late Brian Gibson, whose previous film in 1991 had been the life story of another famous black singer, Josephine Baker. But the film sizzles and fascinates primarily because of the sensational performance of Angela Bassett as Tina Turner. She is simply a knock-out. I presume her singing may have been dubbed by Turner herself. But whether she sang or not, her performance was dazzling, full of charm and sweetness as well as conveying all the heartache, emotional confusion and weakness, joys and sorrows. This is really a superior biopic, and the true story has plenty to tell! One should not neglect to mention that the little girl who plays Tina as a child, Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly, is also superb. (She has grown up and appeared now in 42 films.) Tina Turner had a rough time in life, and it is shown very vividly in this film. She married an egocentric, violent, borderline psychopath named Ike Turner (died 2007), who beat her up regularly for years. Men who beat up women are really sick, but women who let men beat them up year in and year out without leaving them are sick too. In the film her excuse for not leaving Ike is said to be because she 'can't abandon family', due to the trauma of her horrible mother having abandoned her as a child. That does not wash. But let us not heap blame upon the ravaged Tina Turner for the horrors she endured and for her determination over so many years to remain a victim rather than save herself. At last she did summon up the courage to save herself, and she also went on to reinvent herself. So this is a story of heroic endurance and dedication to her art by a girl who was born to sing. If she suffered a lot along the way, well, that's life. But the songs go on.

    Angela Bassett, as Tina Turner asks the musical question "What's Love Got to Do with It" in this 1993 film also starring Laurence Fishburne, Jenifer Lewis, and Khandi Alexander. The film tells the story of Tina Turner's childhood as Anna Mae Bullock her move to St. Louis after her grandmother's death to live with her mother, her meeting Ike Turner at a nightclub, her subsequent singing with Ike's band, their marriage and divorce. By necessity, biopics have to leave out people and incidents, often combining several incidents into one or skipping several steps. In no way does a knowledge of Tina Turner''s life detract from the impact of this film. It's a story of a woman's determination, beating the odds, suffering, perseverance and ultimate success. Ike's and Tina's marriage was pretty much a horror show. Ike was always controlling, to the detriment of his own career, and as he turned to drugs, his abuse of Tina escalated. The most stunning scene in the film (besides the performances, which are fantastic) occurs when the couple fights in a limo en route to a hotel. Ike becomes physical; Tina has discovered Buddhism and finally gets the courage to fight back. A bloody mess, she runs away from him with only 36 cents in her purse. Angela Bassett gives a searing, electrifying performance as Turner. Her sinewy body is a great match for Turner's, and she uses it to perfection in replicating Turner's performances (Turner's voice is used on the soundtrack). She shows the star's vulnerability, fear, and internal strength throughout. Bassett is matched by Laurence Fishburne's terrifying performance as Ike. Fishburne seethes with manipulation and anger, even in scenes where he's being "nice." When Ike loses his temper, you can see how he can't stop and the violence just gets worth. A brilliant performance. A must see. The latter part of Turner's life is not explored, but while she always remained popular in Europe, it was a long time before she could get a recording contract here after some failed recordings. Today she remains one of the greatest singing stars ever. But there were lots of valleys in between.

    There is plenty wrong with this movie as a biopic, however when you look at it as purely being a movie, it is a surprisingly great one. I never really considered Tina Turner to be such a good subject for a biopic, especially not in the '90's. First of all she was still alive and at an all time popular height and second of all, she in my opinion is not a that big star, when compared to all other people who get a biopic made about them. But I must say that after seeing this movie i have a whole lot more respect for her by now and I was definitely wrong about her career and life not being worthy or interesting enough for making a movie about it. The movie was a positive surprise. But nevertheless there still is plenty wrong with it as a biopic. It suffers from lots of the stuff other genre movies often suffer from. Thing with biopics often is that you try to capture a persons entire life and career into a 2 hour long movie. This means some stuff will often get rushed and shoved down your throat. You often just have to take things for granted, without them ever getting developed properly and convincing enough, like would be the case in a normal film drama about a normal average, every day person. And yes, this happens quite a lot in this movie. It often makes some very sudden jumps with its story and make jumps in time as well. We just never get to see how popular Tina Tuner is with the public and some things seem to happen very randomly in this movie, just because they happened in her real life as well. It at times feels like some stuff really got crow-bared into the film. They movie because of that also feels quite distant at times as a biopic, since you don't ever get the feeling you are really getting into the character. But having said all that, the movie still works out great. The story is always intriguing and keeps you interest throughout. It's also really fast-going, which makes this a bit of a distant one when it comes down to its emotions and characters but at the same time keeps this movie consistently good to watch, since you never get bored with things. It's also true that it are the actors performance that keep the movie going and make this a great watch. Angela Bassett really shines and she deserved her Oscar nomination. Same goes for Laurence Fishburne as the abusive Ike Turner, who is perhaps the foremost reason why this movie remains such a good and interesting watch. His character, no matter how awful he is, is still what gives the story as well as the Tina Turner some real depth. Because lets face it, would Tina Turner's life had been interesting enough for a biopic if she had never met Ike? I really don't think so. But of course the movie does not only focus on her personal life but also her career. It's quite fascination to see how she started out and at several points at her career had to start all over again but every time came back stronger, as a performer and person as well. It's why I now have so much more respect for her after seeing this movie. I now kind of wished I would had gone to her concert when she was in town here a decade ago. Besides, I really don't think you have to be a fan of her music in order to enjoy and appreciate her incredible stage presence and performance. Same sort of goes for this movie. You really don't have to be that much in Tina Turner in order to really like and appreciate this movie. 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
