    I cannot see what the big accolades are for? "Ulee's Gold" is a movie that is so low key, it could easily be recommended as a cure for insomnia. Peter Fonda's performance while certainly good, is his usual monotone laid back mumbling. That alone cannot redeem the slow buildup to an ending that is underwhelming at best. This comes across as an emotional fix for females, much like any "Lifetime Channel" potboiler. It certainly cannot qualify as a revenge movie. As an instructional film for aspiring bee keepers it succeeds quite nicely, but as entertainment it leaves one with an underwhelming impression that makes the movie totally forgettable. - MERK

    After getting about 30 minutes into Ulee's Gold I said to myself, "Great. Another dysfunctional family movie." There are elements of this film that lead you to believe it will be something much bigger and much more original than the average dysfunctional family film. For instance, the dynamics of this family are set up in an interesting way. Ulee (Peter Fonda) is the grandfather of the two children he cares for. The parents of these children are criminals. Their father is in jail and their mother ran off and lives with two sleazy men she and her husband used to work with. Ulee realizes he has to bring this family back together so the plot of the film is him bringing his daughter in law home, and then facing the repercussions of this act. The story has the foundation for something incredibly enthralling, but I was personally underwhelmed as I felt that nothing much was achieved through this film and it wasn't really engaging in the slightest. This film lacks any kind of pizazz or real gripping elements. I'm OK with this when the film makes up for it by being either incredibly well made or proves to be a much more clever and complex story. Ulee's Gold is neither of these things. It just kind of leaves you with a sense of lackluster, half entertained dullness. There isn't much to this film, as far as I could tell, and it didn't really grab me emotionally like I felt it tried to do. While it could have really moved me or really intellectually engaged me, it fell short and I see it now as another film that ends up just being there. It's just another film with nothing very special about it to get my attention. But perhaps I'm being too harsh on the films story just for not living up to my expectations. It is an interesting story and it has its moments that can draw you in, but overall I was underwhelmed. Where this film's major issues stem from is just its overall tone. One of my least favorite things is when a film wants to be dramatic and it just tries too hard to be sincere and depressing. In Ulee's Gold I feel as if every character has just woken up at every moment of the film. They are all so bland and so dull that I just want to yell at them, "Have some enthusiasm! Wake up! Speak up!" The entire film just gives off this unbelievable sense of melodrama with all of the characters acting way too bleak. I understand that they are all in bad situations, and no doubt have a reason to be depressed, but if this monotone attitude could just break for one second I could buy into the drama of this film a little more. But instead the whole film is loaded with unrealistic dialouge that just furthers a one dimensional tone that gets old quickly. There's that split between realistic drama and melodrama. I wouldn't say Ulee's Gold dives head first into the melodrama side, but it certainly leans way too far in that direction for me to consider this emotionally engaging drama. I really wanted to enjoy Ulee's Gold. It had so much going for it and is one of those films that could have been so much better. But try as I might I could only find this film slow, dull, and monotonous. People have revered Peter Fonda's role as Ulee, but I honestly saw nothing in his performance. It fit with the rest of the dreary acting, complete with blank stare and all. I felt nothing while watching this movie, and that includes entertainment. I figure I will forget this movie within a week. Unfortunate, but true.

    I have seen this movie many times, and it gets better each time. The scene when a hive is destroyed and Ulee recovers it is the scene that exposes the parallel themes of the film: keeping his family together, and the bees producing (credited in the end titles). The story has incredible tension, but the film seems almost relaxed; no dramatic music, no fast camera action, but a calm sense of reality. This feeling is accentuated by the beautiful photography. The natural lighting in the grocery store parking lot, and the slightly out-of-focus shot of nurse Hope at the truck with groceries are two shots that just knock me out. The last scene at the prison chokes me up even thinking about it. But with all the pain and trouble, the reward is---honey, Tupelo honey.

    The title of the film "Ulee's Gold" does not inspire most movie-goers to run to their local theaters. As a skeptic, I gave the film a chance on a rainy Thursday evening & what a pleasant surprise. Those of us who enjoy superb acting, a good storyline & script, and a capable leading man are in for a treat. Standoffish, reclusive, & heartbroken beekeeper Ulee Jackson lives a simple life caring for his grandchildren in Florida. But the simple life is not without challenges. Ulee is forced to face his jailed son's crime & cohorts, a daughter-in-law on drugs, raising girls coming of age, & a new neighbor with a big heart. Through it all, Ulee keeps a stiff upper lip & a strong familial presence in order to right the wrongs & keep his simple life whole. Peter Fonda outdoes himself in the title role & gives you reason to believe in Ulee's fortitude. Jessica Biel & Patricia Richardson are more than capable in their respective supporting roles. If you get a chance, give "Ulee's Gold" a gander. You won't be disappointed. Platinum,....simply platinum.

    A beekeeper raising his two granddaughters while his son is in jail must deal with his son's old cohorts. This is a well-acted character study, with Fonda having one of his best roles as a widower who wants to live a quiet existence but must take steps to keep his dysfunctional family together. His low-key performance as a man of quiet integrity recalls his father in films like "The Grapes of Wrath." Richardson is fine as a helpful neighbor while Biel makes her film debut as one of the granddaughters. While most of the film is engaging, the plot is weak, failing to deliver a strong ending to satisfactorily wrap up the story.

    Peter Fonda gives a quietly effective performance as a man struggling to reconnect with his troubled family in this indie drama from 1997. "Ulee's Gold" is the kind of film that's composed of long takes and longer silences. Fonda is taciturn and even unlikable at times -- ditto his daughter-in-law and grandchildren, who he must care for when his son goes to prison. Fonda revealed a talent in the later half of his career that he hadn't -- "Easy Rider" aside -- let the world see before, and hasn't really let anyone see since, to tell the truth. It was enough to win him a Best Actor Academy Award nomination, but not enough to help him beat Jack Nicholson, in a year when the Academy wanted to send a message to the independents that the major studios were alive and kicking. Grade: B+

    Ulee (Peter Fonda) is a beekeeper who produces some of the finest honey available, Tupelo Gold. While there is some very interesting material on beekeeping, this is essentially a good story about a somewhat dysfunctional family. Ulee is a widower raising his two granddaughters on his own while his son is in prison and his daughter-in-law has run off. The cast includes Patricia Richardson (Home Improvement) as a Nurse that lives next door and a potential love interest for Ulee. While Ulee's eldest daughter is played by Jessica Biel in one of her first film roles , I really appreciated the depiction of a character acting heroically in the face of adversity without resorting to the violence that is so common in many Hollywood pictures. The film was written, directed, edited and shot by Victor Nunez on a very limited budget, but I did not find any such limitations at all obvious in the execution. Features an Oscar nominated performance from Peter Fonda, who won numerous awards for the role including a Golden Globe.

    When this film appeared there was a genuine mild Oscar buzz around it, particularly it was said because of Peter Fonda's mesmerising performance. I sat and watched Peter and his cast friends. It was maybe the most painful film I'd ever had to watch. Dull. Slow. I'm a sucker for character-rich films that others can find "too wordy". But, this had nothing. There is one excruciating scene where he stands, with a female friend, in his kitchen first pouring then drinking a glass of water. It lasts for seemingly hours with nothing going on. No chat, nothing. The camera dwells upon Fonda in a way that suggests he is a God about to utter an all-important oratory. But, nothing of note spews out. You hope that maybe one of Fonda's hived bees may provide some captivating diversion. But, no. Then I realised whom must have generated all that original buzz.

    "Peter Fonda was never an action star"... So said Roger Ebert. That captures the essence of Fonda's performance, which is also the essence of "Ulee's Gold". There are those actors of past and present who visibly try to get you to notice them - Alec Baldwin, Robin WIlliams, and Marlon Brando are examples. There are those who do not try, and yet they still attract your attention - Gary Cooper, Steve McQueen, Randolph Scott - because of their charisma in what they say and do, regardless of how seldom they say and do it. Then there is the rarest of all actors - those who seem to be trying to get you to NOT notice them. Then, when their time to shine (their "close up", if you will) come along, you not only notice them, but you remember them. The only two actors I have known to do this are Spencer Tracy and Henry Fonda. In "Ulee's Gold" Peter Fonda shows he too has this ability, even if he seldom gets a chance to use it. In viewing this film, I saw much of Henry in Peter's performance. If you were to view "My Darling CLementine" you would also see the parallels in Henry's performance - how he calmly subdues a drunkard who is shooting up a saloon, and the easily Peter calmly walks into a nest of agitated bees. And the way both men act when harm threatens their family - they are calm and patient on the outside, but only until it is time to act. Then, they perform acts of cunning and bravery. Most of the time, they don't seem to be doing much at all. But you must still watch them because when they do something, you don't want to miss it. Henry made a number of exceptional films over a 45 year career - many good, but none wildly phenomenal. Peter mad the most influential film of his generation ("Easy Rider") while still in his 20s and has not come close to that level since. With "Easy Rider", we knew Peter was an icon. With "Ulee's Gold", we discover that he is Henry's son.

    It's hard for me to watch Ulee's Gold without a couple of big juicy tears welling up ten minutes into the film. That's approximately when Ulee Jackson (Peter Fonda), working in his garage, is drawn into a reluctant conversation with his seven-something granddaughter Penny (Vanessa Zima) about the men in his platoon in Vietnam, none of whom survived. "Those were good guys, Penny." "It's so sad," she says. "You like sad?" "No, but sometimes inside it makes you quiet." That scene and this poignant statement by an adorable little girl give you the essence of the movie: the bittersweet, calm dignity of an honest man's living struggle. In fifteen minutes through his interactions with people in town and briefly at home, the extraordinarily ordinary person of Ulysses Jackson is established: He's a beekeeper, pursues the excellence of Tupelo honey, keeps things to himself, has lost his wife, is taking care of his two granddaughters (the teen is difficult), their father is in prison for robbery, their mother abandoned them, Ulee is physically beatup, and his honey harvest is due. Shortly thereafter Ulee gets a call from his son Jimmy (Tom Wood) insisting Ulee must visit him now. Jimmy's wife Helen (Christine Dunford) has told Jimmy's former cohorts in crime, Eddie Flowers (Steven Flynn) and Ferris Dooley (Dewey Weber), that Jimmy hid some money from the heist. They have her jacked up on roofies (Rohypnol), held hostage. Jimmy pleads with Ulee to retrieve Helen for purely family-value reasons. That's the key decision in the movie, because you see Uleehe deplores Helen for running out on her daughtersweighing all the consequences. He does the hardest thing he's ever done by doing the right thing. In an act of immense courage, with a honey crop to harvest, he travels several more hours the next day to rescue Helen. What happens subsequently bears out his worst fears. Yet through these difficulties the family comes together, Ulee begins to open up to another woman Connie Hope (!) (Patricia Richardson), and each of the Jackson women experience growth or redemption. The scene where Ulee and Connie share tender, illuminating conversation over tea in the kitchen is one of my most memorable moments in cinema. Peter Fonda won a Golden Globe for his performance as Ulee Jackson. The younger actresses got a couple of nominations and awards for lesser known ratings orgs, and Victor Nunez got nods in several independent film venues for director and writer. True to the prizes, Fonda does make the film. ... For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com. Thank you.

Most of the time, they don't seem to be doing much at all. But you must still watch them because when they do something, you don't want to miss it. Henry made a number of exceptional films over a 45 year career - many good, but none wildly phenomenal. Peter mad the most influential film of his generation ("Easy Rider") while still in his 20s and has not come close to that level since. With "Easy Rider", we knew Peter was an icon. With "Ulee's Gold", we discover that he is Henry's son.

    It's hard for me to watch Ulee's Gold without a couple of big juicy tears welling up ten minutes into the film. That's approximately when Ulee Jackson (Peter Fonda), working in his garage, is drawn into a reluctant conversation with his seven-something granddaughter Penny (Vanessa Zima) about the men in his platoon in Vietnam, none of whom survived. "Those were good guys, Penny." "It's so sad," she says. "You like sad?" "No, but sometimes inside it makes you quiet." That scene and this poignant statement by an adorable little girl give you the essence of the movie: the bittersweet, calm dignity of an honest man's living struggle. In fifteen minutes through his interactions with people in town and briefly at home, the extraordinarily ordinary person of Ulysses Jackson is established: He's a beekeeper, pursues the excellence of Tupelo honey, keeps things to himself, has lost his wife, is taking care of his two granddaughters (the teen is difficult), their father is in prison for robbery, their mother abandoned them, Ulee is physically beatup, and his honey harvest is due. Shortly thereafter Ulee gets a call from his son Jimmy (Tom Wood) insisting Ulee must visit him now. Jimmy's wife Helen (Christine Dunford) has told Jimmy's former cohorts in crime, Eddie Flowers (Steven Flynn) and Ferris Dooley (Dewey Weber), that Jimmy hid some money from the heist. They have her jacked up on roofies (Rohypnol), held hostage. Jimmy pleads with Ulee to retrieve Helen for purely family-value reasons. That's the key decision in the movie, because you see Uleehe deplores Helen for running out on her daughtersweighing all the consequences. He does the hardest thing he's ever done by doing the right thing. In an act of immense courage, with a honey crop to harvest, he travels several more hours the next day to rescue Helen. What happens subsequently bears out his worst fears. Yet through these difficulties the family comes together, Ulee begins to open up to another woman Connie Hope (!) (Patricia Richardson), and each of the Jackson women experience growth or redemption. The scene where Ulee and Connie share tender, illuminating conversation over tea in the kitchen is one of my most memorable moments in cinema. Peter Fonda won a Golden Globe for his performance as Ulee Jackson. The younger actresses got a couple of nominations and awards for lesser known ratings orgs, and Victor Nunez got nods in several independent film venues for director and writer. True to the prizes, Fonda does make the film. ... For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com. Thank you.

    I cannot see what the big accolades are for? "Ulee's Gold" is a movie that is so low key, it could easily be recommended as a cure for insomnia. Peter Fonda's performance while certainly good, is his usual monotone laid back mumbling. That alone cannot redeem the slow buildup to an ending that is underwhelming at best. This comes across as an emotional fix for females, much like any "Lifetime Channel" potboiler. It certainly cannot qualify as a revenge movie. As an instructional film for aspiring bee keepers it succeeds quite nicely, but as entertainment it leaves one with an underwhelming impression that makes the movie totally forgettable. - MERK

    After getting about 30 minutes into Ulee's Gold I said to myself, "Great. Another dysfunctional family movie." There are elements of this film that lead you to believe it will be something much bigger and much more original than the average dysfunctional family film. For instance, the dynamics of this family are set up in an interesting way. Ulee (Peter Fonda) is the grandfather of the two children he cares for. The parents of these children are criminals. Their father is in jail and their mother ran off and lives with two sleazy men she and her husband used to work with. Ulee realizes he has to bring this family back together so the plot of the film is him bringing his daughter in law home, and then facing the repercussions of this act. The story has the foundation for something incredibly enthralling, but I was personally underwhelmed as I felt that nothing much was achieved through this film and it wasn't really engaging in the slightest. This film lacks any kind of pizazz or real gripping elements. I'm OK with this when the film makes up for it by being either incredibly well made or proves to be a much more clever and complex story. Ulee's Gold is neither of these things. It just kind of leaves you with a sense of lackluster, half entertained dullness. There isn't much to this film, as far as I could tell, and it didn't really grab me emotionally like I felt it tried to do. While it could have really moved me or really intellectually engaged me, it fell short and I see it now as another film that ends up just being there. It's just another film with nothing very special about it to get my attention. But perhaps I'm being too harsh on the films story just for not living up to my expectations. It is an interesting story and it has its moments that can draw you in, but overall I was underwhelmed. Where this film's major issues stem from is just its overall tone. One of my least favorite things is when a film wants to be dramatic and it just tries too hard to be sincere and depressing. In Ulee's Gold I feel as if every character has just woken up at every moment of the film. They are all so bland and so dull that I just want to yell at them, "Have some enthusiasm! Wake up! Speak up!" The entire film just gives off this unbelievable sense of melodrama with all of the characters acting way too bleak. I understand that they are all in bad situations, and no doubt have a reason to be depressed, but if this monotone attitude could just break for one second I could buy into the drama of this film a little more. But instead the whole film is loaded with unrealistic dialouge that just furthers a one dimensional tone that gets old quickly. There's that split between realistic drama and melodrama. I wouldn't say Ulee's Gold dives head first into the melodrama side, but it certainly leans way too far in that direction for me to consider this emotionally engaging drama. I really wanted to enjoy Ulee's Gold. It had so much going for it and is one of those films that could have been so much better. But try as I might I could only find this film slow, dull, and monotonous. People have revered Peter Fonda's role as Ulee, but I honestly saw nothing in his performance. It fit with the rest of the dreary acting, complete with blank stare and all. I felt nothing while watching this movie, and that includes entertainment. I figure I will forget this movie within a week. Unfortunate, but true.

    I have seen this movie many times, and it gets better each time. The scene when a hive is destroyed and Ulee recovers it is the scene that exposes the parallel themes of the film: keeping his family together, and the bees producing (credited in the end titles). The story has incredible tension, but the film seems almost relaxed; no dramatic music, no fast camera action, but a calm sense of reality. This feeling is accentuated by the beautiful photography. The natural lighting in the grocery store parking lot, and the slightly out-of-focus shot of nurse Hope at the truck with groceries are two shots that just knock me out. The last scene at the prison chokes me up even thinking about it. But with all the pain and trouble, the reward is---honey, Tupelo honey.

    The title of the film "Ulee's Gold" does not inspire most movie-goers to run to their local theaters. As a skeptic, I gave the film a chance on a rainy Thursday evening & what a pleasant surprise. Those of us who enjoy superb acting, a good storyline & script, and a capable leading man are in for a treat. Standoffish, reclusive, & heartbroken beekeeper Ulee Jackson lives a simple life caring for his grandchildren in Florida. But the simple life is not without challenges. Ulee is forced to face his jailed son's crime & cohorts, a daughter-in-law on drugs, raising girls coming of age, & a new neighbor with a big heart. Through it all, Ulee keeps a stiff upper lip & a strong familial presence in order to right the wrongs & keep his simple life whole. Peter Fonda outdoes himself in the title role & gives you reason to believe in Ulee's fortitude. Jessica Biel & Patricia Richardson are more than capable in their respective supporting roles. If you get a chance, give "Ulee's Gold" a gander. You won't be disappointed. Platinum,....simply platinum.

    A beekeeper raising his two granddaughters while his son is in jail must deal with his son's old cohorts. This is a well-acted character study, with Fonda having one of his best roles as a widower who wants to live a quiet existence but must take steps to keep his dysfunctional family together. His low-key performance as a man of quiet integrity recalls his father in films like "The Grapes of Wrath." Richardson is fine as a helpful neighbor while Biel makes her film debut as one of the granddaughters. While most of the film is engaging, the plot is weak, failing to deliver a strong ending to satisfactorily wrap up the story.

    Peter Fonda gives a quietly effective performance as a man struggling to reconnect with his troubled family in this indie drama from 1997. "Ulee's Gold" is the kind of film that's composed of long takes and longer silences. Fonda is taciturn and even unlikable at times -- ditto his daughter-in-law and grandchildren, who he must care for when his son goes to prison. Fonda revealed a talent in the later half of his career that he hadn't -- "Easy Rider" aside -- let the world see before, and hasn't really let anyone see since, to tell the truth. It was enough to win him a Best Actor Academy Award nomination, but not enough to help him beat Jack Nicholson, in a year when the Academy wanted to send a message to the independents that the major studios were alive and kicking.

    Ulee (Peter Fonda) is a beekeeper who produces some of the finest honey available, Tupelo Gold. While there is some very interesting material on beekeeping, this is essentially a good story about a somewhat dysfunctional family. Ulee is a widower raising his two granddaughters on his own while his son is in prison and his daughter-in-law has run off. The cast includes Patricia Richardson (Home Improvement) as a Nurse that lives next door and a potential love interest for Ulee. While Ulee's eldest daughter is played by Jessica Biel in one of her first film roles , I really appreciated the depiction of a character acting heroically in the face of adversity without resorting to the violence that is so common in many Hollywood pictures. The film was written, directed, edited and shot by Victor Nunez on a very limited budget, but I did not find any such limitations at all obvious in the execution. Features an Oscar nominated performance from Peter Fonda, who won numerous awards for the role including a Golden Globe.

    When this film appeared there was a genuine mild Oscar buzz around it, particularly it was said because of Peter Fonda's mesmerising performance. I sat and watched Peter and his cast friends. It was maybe the most painful film I'd ever had to watch. Dull. Slow. I'm a sucker for character-rich films that others can find "too wordy". But, this had nothing. There is one excruciating scene where he stands, with a female friend, in his kitchen first pouring then drinking a glass of water. It lasts for seemingly hours with nothing going on. No chat, nothing. The camera dwells upon Fonda in a way that suggests he is a God about to utter an all-important oratory. But, nothing of note spews out. You hope that maybe one of Fonda's hived bees may provide some captivating diversion. But, no. Then I realised whom must have generated all that original buzz.

    "Peter Fonda was never an action star"... So said Roger Ebert. That captures the essence of Fonda's performance, which is also the essence of "Ulee's Gold". There are those actors of past and present who visibly try to get you to notice them - Alec Baldwin, Robin WIlliams, and Marlon Brando are examples. There are those who do not try, and yet they still attract your attention - Gary Cooper, Steve McQueen, Randolph Scott - because of their charisma in what they say and do, regardless of how seldom they say and do it. Then there is the rarest of all actors - those who seem to be trying to get you to NOT notice them. Then, when their time to shine (their "close up", if you will) come along, you not only notice them, but you remember them. The only two actors I have known to do this are Spencer Tracy and Henry Fonda. In "Ulee's Gold" Peter Fonda shows he too has this ability, even if he seldom gets a chance to use it. In viewing this film, I saw much of Henry in Peter's performance. If you were to view "My Darling CLementine" you would also see the parallels in Henry's performance - how he calmly subdues a drunkard who is shooting up a saloon, and the easily Peter calmly walks into a nest of agitated bees. And the way both men act when harm threatens their family - they are calm and patient on the outside, but only until it is time to act. Then, they perform acts of cunning and bravery. Most of the time, they don't seem to be doing much at all. But you must still watch them because when they do something, you don't want to miss it. Henry made a number of exceptional films over a 45 year career - many good, but none wildly phenomenal. Peter mad the most influential film of his generation ("Easy Rider") while still in his 20s and has not come close to that level since. With "Easy Rider", we knew Peter was an icon. With "Ulee's Gold", we discover that he is Henry's son.

    It's hard for me to watch Ulee's Gold without a couple of big juicy tears welling up ten minutes into the film. That's approximately when Ulee Jackson (Peter Fonda), working in his garage, is drawn into a reluctant conversation with his seven-something granddaughter Penny (Vanessa Zima) about the men in his platoon in Vietnam, none of whom survived.

    "Peter Fonda was never an action star"... So said Roger Ebert. That captures the essence of Fonda's performance, which is also the essence of "Ulee's Gold". There are those actors of past and present who visibly try to get you to notice them - Alec Baldwin, Robin WIlliams, and Marlon Brando are examples. There are those who do not try, and yet they still attract your attention - Gary Cooper, Steve McQueen, Randolph Scott - because of their charisma in what they say and do, regardless of how seldom they say and do it. Then there is the rarest of all actors - those who seem to be trying to get you to NOT notice them. Then, when their time to shine (their "close up", if you will) come along, you not only notice them, but you remember them. The only two actors I have known to do this are Spencer Tracy and Henry Fonda. In "Ulee's Gold" Peter Fonda shows he too has this ability, even if he seldom gets a chance to use it. In viewing this film, I saw much of Henry in Peter's performance. If you were to view "My Darling CLementine" you would also see the parallels in Henry's performance - how he calmly subdues a drunkard who is shooting up a saloon, and the easily Peter calmly walks into a nest of agitated bees. And the way both men act when harm threatens their family - they are calm and patient on the outside, but only until it is time to act. Then, they perform acts of cunning and bravery. Most of the time, they don't seem to be doing much at all. But you must still watch them because when they do something, you don't want to miss it. Henry made a number of exceptional films over a 45 year career - many good, but none wildly phenomenal. Peter mad the most influential film of his generation ("Easy Rider") while still in his 20s and has not come close to that level since. With "Easy Rider", we knew Peter was an icon. With "Ulee's Gold", we discover that he is Henry's son.

    It's hard for me to watch Ulee's Gold without a couple of big juicy tears welling up ten minutes into the film. That's approximately when Ulee Jackson (Peter Fonda), working in his garage, is drawn into a reluctant conversation with his seven-something granddaughter Penny (Vanessa Zima) about the men in his platoon in Vietnam, none of whom survived. "Those were good guys, Penny." "It's so sad," she says. "You like sad?" "No, but sometimes inside it makes you quiet." That scene and this poignant statement by an adorable little girl give you the essence of the movie: the bittersweet, calm dignity of an honest man's living struggle. In fifteen minutes through his interactions with people in town and briefly at home, the extraordinarily ordinary person of Ulysses Jackson is established: He's a beekeeper, pursues the excellence of Tupelo honey, keeps things to himself, has lost his wife, is taking care of his two granddaughters (the teen is difficult), their father is in prison for robbery, their mother abandoned them, Ulee is physically beatup, and his honey harvest is due. Shortly thereafter Ulee gets a call from his son Jimmy (Tom Wood) insisting Ulee must visit him now. Jimmy's wife Helen (Christine Dunford) has told Jimmy's former cohorts in crime, Eddie Flowers (Steven Flynn) and Ferris Dooley (Dewey Weber), that Jimmy hid some money from the heist. They have her jacked up on roofies (Rohypnol), held hostage. Jimmy pleads with Ulee to retrieve Helen for purely family-value reasons. That's the key decision in the movie, because you see Uleehe deplores Helen for running out on her daughtersweighing all the consequences. He does the hardest thing he's ever done by doing the right thing. In an act of immense courage, with a honey crop to harvest, he travels several more hours the next day to rescue Helen. What happens subsequently bears out his worst fears. Yet through these difficulties the family comes together, Ulee begins to open up to another woman Connie Hope (!) (Patricia Richardson), and each of the Jackson women experience growth or redemption. The scene where Ulee and Connie share tender, illuminating conversation over tea in the kitchen is one of my most memorable moments in cinema. Peter Fonda won a Golden Globe for his performance as Ulee Jackson. The younger actresses got a couple of nominations and awards for lesser known ratings orgs, and Victor Nunez got nods in several independent film venues for director and writer. True to the prizes, Fonda does make the film. ... For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com. Thank you.

    I cannot see what the big accolades are for? "Ulee's Gold" is a movie that is so low key, it could easily be recommended as a cure for insomnia. Peter Fonda's performance while certainly good, is his usual monotone laid back mumbling. That alone cannot redeem the slow buildup to an ending that is underwhelming at best. This comes across as an emotional fix for females, much like any "Lifetime Channel" potboiler. It certainly cannot qualify as a revenge movie. As an instructional film for aspiring bee keepers it succeeds quite nicely, but as entertainment it leaves one with an underwhelming impression that makes the movie totally forgettable. - MERK

    After getting about 30 minutes into Ulee's Gold I said to myself, "Great. Another dysfunctional family movie." There are elements of this film that lead you to believe it will be something much bigger and much more original than the average dysfunctional family film. For instance, the dynamics of this family are set up in an interesting way. Ulee (Peter Fonda) is the grandfather of the two children he cares for. The parents of these children are criminals. Their father is in jail and their mother ran off and lives with two sleazy men she and her husband used to work with. Ulee realizes he has to bring this family back together so the plot of the film is him bringing his daughter in law home, and then facing the repercussions of this act. The story has the foundation for something incredibly enthralling, but I was personally underwhelmed as I felt that nothing much was achieved through this film and it wasn't really engaging in the slightest. This film lacks any kind of pizazz or real gripping elements. I'm OK with this when the film makes up for it by being either incredibly well made or proves to be a much more clever and complex story. Ulee's Gold is neither of these things. It just kind of leaves you with a sense of lackluster, half entertained dullness. There isn't much to this film, as far as I could tell, and it didn't really grab me emotionally like I felt it tried to do. While it could have really moved me or really intellectually engaged me, it fell short and I see it now as another film that ends up just being there. It's just another film with nothing very special about it to get my attention. But perhaps I'm being too harsh on the films story just for not living up to my expectations. It is an interesting story and it has its moments that can draw you in, but overall I was underwhelmed. Where this film's major issues stem from is just its overall tone. One of my least favorite things is when a film wants to be dramatic and it just tries too hard to be sincere and depressing. In Ulee's Gold I feel as if every character has just woken up at every moment of the film. They are all so bland and so dull that I just want to yell at them, "Have some enthusiasm! Wake up! Speak up!" The entire film just gives off this unbelievable sense of melodrama with all of the characters acting way too bleak. I understand that they are all in bad situations, and no doubt have a reason to be depressed, but if this monotone attitude could just break for one second I could buy into the drama of this film a little more. But instead the whole film is loaded with unrealistic dialouge that just furthers a one dimensional tone that gets old quickly. There's that split between realistic drama and melodrama. I wouldn't say Ulee's Gold dives head first into the melodrama side, but it certainly leans way too far in that direction for me to consider this emotionally engaging drama. I really wanted to enjoy Ulee's Gold. It had so much going for it and is one of those films that could have been so much better. But try as I might I could only find this film slow, dull, and monotonous. People have revered Peter Fonda's role as Ulee, but I honestly saw nothing in his performance. It fit with the rest of the dreary acting, complete with blank stare and all. I felt nothing while watching this movie, and that includes entertainment. I figure I will forget this movie within a week. Unfortunate, but true.

    I have seen this movie many times, and it gets better each time. The scene when a hive is destroyed and Ulee recovers it is the scene that exposes the parallel themes of the film: keeping his family together, and the bees producing (credited in the end titles). The story has incredible tension, but the film seems almost relaxed; no dramatic music, no fast camera action, but a calm sense of reality. This feeling is accentuated by the beautiful photography. The natural lighting in the grocery store parking lot, and the slightly out-of-focus shot of nurse Hope at the truck with groceries are two shots that just knock me out. The last scene at the prison chokes me up even thinking about it. But with all the pain and trouble, the reward is---honey, Tupelo honey.

    The title of the film "Ulee's Gold" does not inspire most movie-goers to run to their local theaters. As a skeptic, I gave the film a chance on a rainy Thursday evening & what a pleasant surprise. Those of us who enjoy superb acting, a good storyline & script, and a capable leading man are in for a treat. Standoffish, reclusive, & heartbroken beekeeper Ulee Jackson lives a simple life caring for his grandchildren in Florida. But the simple life is not without challenges. Ulee is forced to face his jailed son's crime & cohorts, a daughter-in-law on drugs, raising girls coming of age, & a new neighbor with a big heart. Through it all, Ulee keeps a stiff upper lip & a strong familial presence in order to right the wrongs & keep his simple life whole. Peter Fonda outdoes himself in the title role & gives you reason to believe in Ulee's fortitude. Jessica Biel & Patricia Richardson are more than capable in their respective supporting roles. If you get a chance, give "Ulee's Gold" a gander. You won't be disappointed. Platinum,....simply platinum.

    A beekeeper raising his two granddaughters while his son is in jail must deal with his son's old cohorts. This is a well-acted character study, with Fonda having one of his best roles as a widower who wants to live a quiet existence but must take steps to keep his dysfunctional family together. His low-key performance as a man of quiet integrity recalls his father in films like "The Grapes of Wrath." Richardson is fine as a helpful neighbor while Biel makes her film debut as one of the granddaughters. While most of the film is engaging, the plot is weak, failing to deliver a strong ending to satisfactorily wrap up the story.

"Ulee's Gold" is the kind of film that's composed of long takes and longer silences. Fonda is taciturn and even unlikable at times -- ditto his daughter-in-law and grandchildren, who he must care for when his son goes to prison. Fonda revealed a talent in the later half of his career that he hadn't -- "Easy Rider" aside -- let the world see before, and hasn't really let anyone see since, to tell the truth. It was enough to win him a Best Actor Academy Award nomination, but not enough to help him beat Jack Nicholson, in a year when the Academy wanted to send a message to the independents that the major studios were alive and kicking.

    Ulee (Peter Fonda) is a beekeeper who produces some of the finest honey available, Tupelo Gold. While there is some very interesting material on beekeeping, this is essentially a good story about a somewhat dysfunctional family. Ulee is a widower raising his two granddaughters on his own while his son is in prison and his daughter-in-law has run off. The cast includes Patricia Richardson (Home Improvement) as a Nurse that lives next door and a potential love interest for Ulee. While Ulee's eldest daughter is played by Jessica Biel in one of her first film roles , I really appreciated the depiction of a character acting heroically in the face of adversity without resorting to the violence that is so common in many Hollywood pictures. The film was written, directed, edited and shot by Victor Nunez on a very limited budget, but I did not find any such limitations at all obvious in the execution. Features an Oscar nominated performance from Peter Fonda, who won numerous awards for the role including a Golden Globe.

    When this film appeared there was a genuine mild Oscar buzz around it, particularly it was said because of Peter Fonda's mesmerising performance. I sat and watched Peter and his cast friends. It was maybe the most painful film I'd ever had to watch. Dull. Slow. I'm a sucker for character-rich films that others can find "too wordy". But, this had nothing. There is one excruciating scene where he stands, with a female friend, in his kitchen first pouring then drinking a glass of water. It lasts for seemingly hours with nothing going on. No chat, nothing. The camera dwells upon Fonda in a way that suggests he is a God about to utter an all-important oratory. But, nothing of note spews out. You hope that maybe one of Fonda's hived bees may provide some captivating diversion. But, no. Then I realised whom must have generated all that original buzz.

While Ulee's eldest daughter is played by Jessica Biel in one of her first film roles , I really appreciated the depiction of a character acting heroically in the face of adversity without resorting to the violence that is so common in many Hollywood pictures. The film was written, directed, edited and shot by Victor Nunez on a very limited budget, but I did not find any such limitations at all obvious in the execution. Features an Oscar nominated performance from Peter Fonda, who won numerous awards for the role including a Golden Globe.

    When this film appeared there was a genuine mild Oscar buzz around it, particularly it was said because of Peter Fonda's mesmerising performance. I sat and watched Peter and his cast friends. It was maybe the most painful film I'd ever had to watch. Dull. Slow. I'm a sucker for character-rich films that others can find "too wordy". But, this had nothing. There is one excruciating scene where he stands, with a female friend, in his kitchen first pouring then drinking a glass of water. It lasts for seemingly hours with nothing going on. No chat, nothing. The camera dwells upon Fonda in a way that suggests he is a God about to utter an all-important oratory. But, nothing of note spews out. You hope that maybe one of Fonda's hived bees may provide some captivating diversion. But, no. Then I realised whom must have generated all that original buzz.

    "Peter Fonda was never an action star"... So said Roger Ebert. That captures the essence of Fonda's performance, which is also the essence of "Ulee's Gold". There are those actors of past and present who visibly try to get you to notice them - Alec Baldwin, Robin WIlliams, and Marlon Brando are examples. There are those who do not try, and yet they still attract your attention - Gary Cooper, Steve McQueen, Randolph Scott - because of their charisma in what they say and do, regardless of how seldom they say and do it. Then there is the rarest of all actors - those who seem to be trying to get you to NOT notice them. Then, when their time to shine (their "close up", if you will) come along, you not only notice them, but you remember them. The only two actors I have known to do this are Spencer Tracy and Henry Fonda. In "Ulee's Gold" Peter Fonda shows he too has this ability, even if he seldom gets a chance to use it. In viewing this film, I saw much of Henry in Peter's performance. If you were to view "My Darling CLementine" you would also see the parallels in Henry's performance - how he calmly subdues a drunkard who is shooting up a saloon, and the easily Peter calmly walks into a nest of agitated bees. And the way both men act when harm threatens their family - they are calm and patient on the outside, but only until it is time to act. Then, they perform acts of cunning and bravery. Most of the time, they don't seem to be doing much at all. But you must still watch them because when they do something, you don't want to miss it. Henry made a number of exceptional films over a 45 year career - many good, but none wildly phenomenal. Peter mad the most influential film of his generation ("Easy Rider") while still in his 20s and has not come close to that level since. With "Easy Rider", we knew Peter was an icon. With "Ulee's Gold", we discover that he is Henry's son.

    It's hard for me to watch Ulee's Gold without a couple of big juicy tears welling up ten minutes into the film. That's approximately when Ulee Jackson (Peter Fonda), working in his garage, is drawn into a reluctant conversation with his seven-something granddaughter Penny (Vanessa Zima) about the men in his platoon in Vietnam, none of whom survived. "Those were good guys, Penny." "It's so sad," she says. "You like sad?" "No, but sometimes inside it makes you quiet." That scene and this poignant statement by an adorable little girl give you the essence of the movie: the bittersweet, calm dignity of an honest man's living struggle. In fifteen minutes through his interactions with people in town and briefly at home, the extraordinarily ordinary person of Ulysses Jackson is established: He's a beekeeper, pursues the excellence of Tupelo honey, keeps things to himself, has lost his wife, is taking care of his two granddaughters (the teen is difficult), their father is in prison for robbery, their mother abandoned them, Ulee is physically beatup, and his honey harvest is due. Shortly thereafter Ulee gets a call from his son Jimmy (Tom Wood) insisting Ulee must visit him now. Jimmy's wife Helen (Christine Dunford) has told Jimmy's former cohorts in crime, Eddie Flowers (Steven Flynn) and Ferris Dooley (Dewey Weber), that Jimmy hid some money from the heist. They have her jacked up on roofies (Rohypnol), held hostage. Jimmy pleads with Ulee to retrieve Helen for purely family-value reasons. That's the key decision in the movie, because you see Uleehe deplores Helen for running out on her daughtersweighing all the consequences. He does the hardest thing he's ever done by doing the right thing. In an act of immense courage, with a honey crop to harvest, he travels several more hours the next day to rescue Helen. What happens subsequently bears out his worst fears. Yet through these difficulties the family comes together, Ulee begins to open up to another woman Connie Hope (!) (Patricia Richardson), and each of the Jackson women experience growth or redemption. The scene where Ulee and Connie share tender, illuminating conversation over tea in the kitchen is one of my most memorable moments in cinema. Peter Fonda won a Golden Globe for his performance as Ulee Jackson. The younger actresses got a couple of nominations and awards for lesser known ratings orgs, and Victor Nunez got nods in several independent film venues for director and writer. True to the prizes, Fonda does make the film. ... For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com. Thank you.
