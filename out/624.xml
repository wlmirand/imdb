 <sinopse>
  Donald receives his birthday gifts, which include traditional gifts and information about Brazil (hosted by Z&eacute; Carioca) and Mexico (by Panchito, a Mexican Charro Rooster).
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A large box arrives for Donald on his birthday, three gifts inside. He unwraps one at a time, and each takes him on an adventure. The first is a movie projector with a film about the birds of South American: Donald watches two cartoons, one tells of a penguin who longs to live on a tropical isle and the other about a gaucho boy who hunts the wild ostrich. The second gift is a pop-up book about Brazil. Inside is Z&eacute; Carioca, who takes Donald to Brazil's Bahia for a mix of animation and live action: the two cartoon birds sing and dance with natives. The third gift is a pi&ntilde;ata, accompanied by Panchito. A ride on a magic serape takes the three amigos singing and dancing across Mexico. &iexcl;Ol&eacute;!

    Disney's 7th animated feature film combines animation and live action in a movie which purports to be a travelogue of Latin America in which Donald Duck sees the world, makes a couple of feathered friends, and lusts after a variety of comely young human women. There are a number of different sequences in the film, some musical and some not and, to be frank, not only do they not all fit well, they aren't all up to Disney's usual standard. The penguin sequence is out of place, and much of the central musical sequence, while highly imaginative, is overlong and lacks the discipline which benefited the later Pink Elephants sequence in Dumbo, for instance. And the animation itself isn't always as good as one would expect. And then we have the title song, about three quarters of the way through, in which it all comes gloriously together. Jam packed full of gags, musically full of joy, lyrically clever and witty, and furiously and surrealistically animated, it is a sequence of genius. If only the rest of the film had been as good.

    Well, the first time spent soaking up the sun and South American atmosphere in Saludos Amigos was very enjoyable and felt like a bit of a break from the standard Americanisation of every character that people often assume Disney tends toward. Sadly, the second visit is a much lesser film full of weak musical numbers and recycled ideas. The plot is a simple one - Donald Duck gets a nice birthday present from his friends (including Jose Carioca) and this present allows him to get more of that South American atmosphere into his life for a little while. The first section, all about a penguin trying to reach warmer climes, is actually the highlight of the film because it doesn't feel like just an excuse to fill the screen with some designs and music from South America. Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh, because The Flying Gauchito story/poem is also quite entertaining, but the movie just overstays its welcome by a good 30 minutes or so. Donald Duck is often a lot of fun to watch on screen but his friends aren't quite so entertaining. The usual wealth of writers and directors pitched in to bring this all together and those interested in the history of animation and various styles will find plenty to enjoy (there are some nice, surreal touches that bring music vividly to life and a fun blend of animation and live action in the second half of the film) but it all feels completely superfluous after Saludos Amigos. At the time it was part of a plan to improve American relations with South American countries during WWII, and it has some historic significance, but now it's just an extra oddity that you can take or leave.

    I don't consider this one of the best of Disney, but I do think it is delightful and I also think it is a little better than Saludos Amigos. The Three Caballeros is a little too short and the opening scenes are a tad too coy for my liking, but it gets much better when and if you bear with it. The animation is stunning, with rich bold colours and the characters and backgrounds are beautifully realised. The music is also memorable and give real flavour to some of the scenes. There is also much to enjoy scenes wise, the title number is filled with energy, and You Belong to My Heart is lovely. As entertaining as Jose and Panchito are, what made the movie for me was Donald falls in love with Aurora(sister of Carmen) Miranda and gets caught up in the soundtrack. The whole scene is very charming and funny, and the animated choreography is incredible. Overall, a delightful film and worth seeing for more reasons than just historical value. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Walt Disney's outreach to the South American market resulted in a couple of films--SALUDOS AMIGOS was the first, and THE THREE CABALLEROS came next. To make a comparison, I'd have to see "SA" again, but I do recall that it had some charming musical sequences. The same is true of THE THREE CABALLEROS, especially when the musical score includes the title song (delightully done by Panchito, Jose Carioca and Donald Duck), and repeated throughout, and ballads such as YOU BELONG TO MY HEART and HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO BAIA? All of them are performed with some fantastic art work and animation combining live action and cartoon characters. The last fifteen minutes seems to be scrambling for a way to keep the viewer's attention with some explosive fireworks and a dazzling display of surrealism, minus any conception of a way to end the movie on a high note. The film itself is uneven, offering typical Disney animation for the flying donkey sequence and then resorting to over-the-top fireworks that outdo the Pink Elephants number from DUMBO. But it's hard to resist the bouncy South American flavor of the score and the charming characterizations of Donald, Panchito and Jose Carioca. The stylized conception of a Mexican Christmas by artist Mary Blair is a standout among the art work involved here, although later the pi&ntilde;ata sequence is a bit overwhelming in effects. The dazzling color and the music make it worth watching at least once, although it's hard to make a comparison between this and other Disney full-length features. Some of the action is fast and furious but the sort of thing that will appeal to very young children. Summing up: You will either love it or hate it, but if you're a Disney fan you should see it at least once.

    this is good neighbor PR to Latin America? if i was from another country and viewed this as a public relations machine i would be disturbed. i would probably think Americans and the Disney people were drinking or doing drugs or had just plain lost it. whatever, as a PR machine i just wouldn't get it. as a mind blowingly weird cartoon i understand this. it's lunacy just seems thinly disguised as a travelogue of South America. not that the depictions of South America aren't informing or often charming and musical, the overall effect just seems to make South America seem more like 'Oz' or 'Wonderland' or something. even though a lot of the information is authentic, it makes South America come off like a fantasy or fairy tale rather than something real. and it does have a tendency to make Latin Americans come off as characters in a Disney cartoon rather than real people. especially in the bathing beauty beach scene with Pato Donald. i'm not saying a lot of this isn't the usual Disney cuteness and adorability, a lot of it is. the scene where Pato Donald does a little jitterbug at a outdoor BBQ is precious cute. it's just that when 'Caballeros' gets weird, it fries hard and acidicly. like hard core acid. most of it's visuals and humour are sharp, hot headed and bitingly caustic. although hilariously funny, it sort of leaves the viewer with a sort of a hangover and a disturbed state of mind. i don't think any of this is stereotypical or racist at all. in fact the film is very reverent of South America and it's culture. rather than working as propaganda for the United States, it has a reverse effect of being propaganda for South America instead. the only problem is, having been made mostly by Anglos, i'm not sure a lot of Latinos might feel comfortable being portrayed as larger than life fantasy characters out of a Disney toon. and this does have a bad tendency to portray Latinos as "cute" and doing "cute" things like singing about cookies and doing dances with children. however there is one tough gritty moment with a traditional cock fight. cock fighting here is illegal. as sharp and acerbic as 'Caballeros' gets, it's still very cute and funny and cinematically one of Disney's best works of hand drawn animation. it just sort of makes South America seem like it only exist in fairy tales or something.

    Let me explain my summary. When you are a kid and it's Christmas, think of what it would be like if ALL the beautifully wrapped presents under the tree are actually nothing but underwear! After all, you have very high hopes....only to be bitterly disappointed. As a child, I saw this film and was psyched when it began. The film DID star Donald Duck and like all sane kids, I loved the duck. But then,....it all struck me. It was about as fun as the underwear! Singing, dancing and a travelogue! That was NOT what I'd anticipated. Years later, I rented the film again...assuming my childhood memories must have been wrong. They weren't. The film is a dull and only good to be used as a means to punish misbehaving children. I could imagine a parent saying "If you are good, I'll buy you BEAUTY AND THE BEAST...but if you're bad, THE THREE CABALLEROS!!!". Proof that not everything Disney is good. Aside from nice animation and a catchy theme song, this is dull from start to finish.

    If your kids like this film, IMDb recommends Fellini's 8&frac12;! Yeah, this one's weirder than you thought. The Three Caballeros is essentially a barely narrative series of experimental animated shorts, starting in nature film parody, progressing to a couple of early live-action/animation hybrids, and ending in a lustful interspecies psychedelic freakout--needless to say, it's an influential film. You might have to gag through some touristy Latinisms, but there's some prime Disney surrealism waiting for you if you do. -TK 11/2/10

    Walt Disney was a master at everything in the world of imagination. He made animals talk and never left you disappointed with any of his movies, that is until after his death in 1969, Disney's films slowly started to decline in quality and creativeness. However, good ones do slip in from the early 70s till even now, such as all the Herbie The Love Bug films ('69-'05), the Escape From Witch Mountain films ('73-'74), the Apple Dumpling Gang ('75-'76),Honey I Shrunk The Kids ('89-'97), The Haunted Mansion (2004), Toy Story films ('95-'10), and generally every film out of PIxar (Disney's main animation studio). Good ones do slip in, but now its decreasing more than ever. But let's get back to the golden years of Disney. You honestly never knew what was going to come out. Each film would be different. Walt Disney also made innovations in animation. Now, I'm not talking about Pixar films, but more like how groundbreaking his work was in films such as Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchico. But right now, let's talk a about one of Disney's most peculiar films, The Three Caballeros. So pack your bags for South America, cause that's where we're headed to in this review. The film follows three of Walt's bird friends, Donald Duck, Panchito, and Jose' Carioca through a surreal tour of South America. Not only is the film animated, but it also incorporates real people too, giving it a very interesting feel. Donald and his two other friends all take a look at South America and learn a story about jungle birds and a penguin in search of warmer weather. Th film is greatly entertaining despite how I am making it sound. I don't think this can be described, but just watch and see. One thing I really like about this movie is how exotic Disney makes South America look. They don't do a stereotype of it, but makes a vision of South America and what it would look like if Disney characters came on vacation there. This film is a lot of things and predictable isn't one of them. And that's one of the film's best things, you can't predict it. It's some of Walt Disney's imagination at its best. For me, I wish Walt Disney could've lived forever. His movies and characters never fail to entertain to this very day ! But looking at older Disney films really makes me get mad at what its come to today. Now its TV stations are run by Hannah Montana and the Jonas Bros. I think Walt is spinning in his grave right now; no pun intended. His company has been an absolute mess ever since they put up a Disney channel on TV. They're destroying the Disney image. I don't think Walt Disney himself has anything to do with it anymore. Its just a name now. The name of a brainwashing product designed to make money of kids and release stuff the 'teeny-boppers' and nothing else. Shows like Hannah Montana are the cause of a now new cervical cancer shot for teenagers......... Ouch !

    The Three Caballeros shows Disney at a rather innovative point combining psychedelic imagery with a catchy South American beat. Years before Yellow Submarine, The Three Caballeros brought psychedelic and surreal animation to the stage. Despite a few rocky segments at the beginning, The Three Caballeros ends with energy and visual beauty. The plot is simple, Donald is opening birthday presents (His birthday is humorously on Friday the 13th.) and meeting his old friend Jose Carioca (the Brazilian parrot) and a new friend Panchito Pistoles (the gun-slinging Mexican rooster). The lack of a strong plot and those opening segments (well, the penguin segment was alright, but really The Flying Burrito?)are more than made up in later segments, which takes the form of a travelogue through Bahia in Brazil and Mexico. First stop is Bahia with Jose where live action and animation combine o form a big pop sequence full of bright colors and rollicking samba music. Carmen Miranda's sister Aurora appears in live action singing Os Quidenes de Yaya (The Cookies of Yaya) followed by a surrealist trip through a dance hall full of brightly colored circles, musical instruments playing themselves, and roosters turning into dancers. The second part is a our tour through Mexico on the magical serape. Here Donald chases girls on the beach, dances in traditional Mexican dances and falls in love with a girl singing You Belong to My Heart in Mexico City's nightlife. Thsi leads to one of the most surreal sequences in animation history, full of bouncing flowers, girls running around in neon colors, and a horse with women's legs. This ends in a big sequence with dancing cacti. All finally ends in a fireworks display full of color, and The Three Cablleros have reprise of their signature song. Overall, style 10/10, visuals 10/10, music 10/10, plot 7/10, screenplay 8/10.

    I find it hard to believe that this was a World War II propaganda film. It doesn't really seem to fit that mold. Propaganda of the time was pretty heavy-handed, and most of it isn't all that entertaining today except as an artifact of the period. This movie is a joy to watch in its own right, and if there's an anti-fascist message embedded within, it's awfully subtle. My understanding was that this was Disney's attempt to open up Central and South America as a market for their films, since the war had pretty much eliminated the European market. Whatever its pedigree, though, this is one of the few Disney videos that I don't mind watching endlessly with the kids, especially the parts that involve the titular Caballeros. The movie is somewhat disjointed and episodic, but what holds it all together is good music. My least favorite episode is the story of the flying donkey, which gets old quickly, particularly since (and this is my one complaint) they chose to have a North American announcer attempt a Mexican accent. Why they could not have simply found an actual Mexican actor is beyond me - Los Angeles being in Mexico's backyard, after all. But Disney seemed to enjoy mixing and matching nationalities even into the 1960s, hiring, for example, US actors to play English characters in Mary Poppins, Treasure Island, and 101 Dalmatians; or Hayley Mills, who was a British actress who always seemed to be playing an American. In fact, the latter is something seen commonly nowadays, when it seems half the working actors in Hollywood are British subjects putting on American dialects (Hugh Laurie, Damian Lewis, Christian Bale).

    Walt Disney was a master at everything in the world of imagination. He made animals talk and never left you disappointed with any of his movies, that is until after his death in 1969, Disney's films slowly started to decline in quality and creativeness. However, good ones do slip in from the early 70s till even now, such as all the Herbie The Love Bug films ('69-'05), the Escape From Witch Mountain films ('73-'74), the Apple Dumpling Gang ('75-'76),Honey I Shrunk The Kids ('89-'97), The Haunted Mansion (2004), Toy Story films ('95-'10), and generally every film out of PIxar (Disney's main animation studio). Good ones do slip in, but now its decreasing more than ever. But let's get back to the golden years of Disney. You honestly never knew what was going to come out. Each film would be different. Walt Disney also made innovations in animation. Now, I'm not talking about Pixar films, but more like how groundbreaking his work was in films such as Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchico. But right now, let's talk a about one of Disney's most peculiar films, The Three Caballeros. So pack your bags for South America, cause that's where we're headed to in this review. The film follows three of Walt's bird friends, Donald Duck, Panchito, and Jose' Carioca through a surreal tour of South America. Not only is the film animated, but it also incorporates real people too, giving it a very interesting feel. Donald and his two other friends all take a look at South America and learn a story about jungle birds and a penguin in search of warmer weather. Th film is greatly entertaining despite how I am making it sound. I don't think this can be described, but just watch and see. One thing I really like about this movie is how exotic Disney makes South America look. They don't do a stereotype of it, but makes a vision of South America and what it would look like if Disney characters came on vacation there. This film is a lot of things and predictable isn't one of them. And that's one of the film's best things, you can't predict it. It's some of Walt Disney's imagination at its best. For me, I wish Walt Disney could've lived forever. His movies and characters never fail to entertain to this very day ! But looking at older Disney films really makes me get mad at what its come to today. Now its TV stations are run by Hannah Montana and the Jonas Bros. I think Walt is spinning in his grave right now; no pun intended. His company has been an absolute mess ever since they put up a Disney channel on TV. They're destroying the Disney image. I don't think Walt Disney himself has anything to do with it anymore. Its just a name now. The name of a brainwashing product designed to make money of kids and release stuff the 'teeny-boppers' and nothing else. Shows like Hannah Montana are the cause of a now new cervical cancer shot for teenagers......... Ouch !

    The Three Caballeros shows Disney at a rather innovative point combining psychedelic imagery with a catchy South American beat. Years before Yellow Submarine, The Three Caballeros brought psychedelic and surreal animation to the stage. Despite a few rocky segments at the beginning, The Three Caballeros ends with energy and visual beauty. The plot is simple, Donald is opening birthday presents (His birthday is humorously on Friday the 13th.) and meeting his old friend Jose Carioca (the Brazilian parrot) and a new friend Panchito Pistoles (the gun-slinging Mexican rooster). The lack of a strong plot and those opening segments (well, the penguin segment was alright, but really The Flying Burrito?)are more than made up in later segments, which takes the form of a travelogue through Bahia in Brazil and Mexico. First stop is Bahia with Jose where live action and animation combine o form a big pop sequence full of bright colors and rollicking samba music. Carmen Miranda's sister Aurora appears in live action singing Os Quidenes de Yaya (The Cookies of Yaya) followed by a surrealist trip through a dance hall full of brightly colored circles, musical instruments playing themselves, and roosters turning into dancers. The second part is a our tour through Mexico on the magical serape. Here Donald chases girls on the beach, dances in traditional Mexican dances and falls in love with a girl singing You Belong to My Heart in Mexico City's nightlife. Thsi leads to one of the most surreal sequences in animation history, full of bouncing flowers, girls running around in neon colors, and a horse with women's legs. This ends in a big sequence with dancing cacti. All finally ends in a fireworks display full of color, and The Three Cablleros have reprise of their signature song. Overall, style 10/10, visuals 10/10, music 10/10, plot 7/10, screenplay 8/10.

    I find it hard to believe that this was a World War II propaganda film. It doesn't really seem to fit that mold. Propaganda of the time was pretty heavy-handed, and most of it isn't all that entertaining today except as an artifact of the period. This movie is a joy to watch in its own right, and if there's an anti-fascist message embedded within, it's awfully subtle. My understanding was that this was Disney's attempt to open up Central and South America as a market for their films, since the war had pretty much eliminated the European market. Whatever its pedigree, though, this is one of the few Disney videos that I don't mind watching endlessly with the kids, especially the parts that involve the titular Caballeros. The movie is somewhat disjointed and episodic, but what holds it all together is good music. My least favorite episode is the story of the flying donkey, which gets old quickly, particularly since (and this is my one complaint) they chose to have a North American announcer attempt a Mexican accent. Why they could not have simply found an actual Mexican actor is beyond me - Los Angeles being in Mexico's backyard, after all. But Disney seemed to enjoy mixing and matching nationalities even into the 1960s, hiring, for example, US actors to play English characters in Mary Poppins, Treasure Island, and 101 Dalmatians; or Hayley Mills, who was a British actress who always seemed to be playing an American. In fact, the latter is something seen commonly nowadays, when it seems half the working actors in Hollywood are British subjects putting on American dialects (Hugh Laurie, Damian Lewis, Christian Bale).

    Disney's 7th animated feature film combines animation and live action in a movie which purports to be a travelogue of Latin America in which Donald Duck sees the world, makes a couple of feathered friends, and lusts after a variety of comely young human women. There are a number of different sequences in the film, some musical and some not and, to be frank, not only do they not all fit well, they aren't all up to Disney's usual standard. The penguin sequence is out of place, and much of the central musical sequence, while highly imaginative, is overlong and lacks the discipline which benefited the later Pink Elephants sequence in Dumbo, for instance. And the animation itself isn't always as good as one would expect. And then we have the title song, about three quarters of the way through, in which it all comes gloriously together. Jam packed full of gags, musically full of joy, lyrically clever and witty, and furiously and surrealistically animated, it is a sequence of genius. If only the rest of the film had been as good.

    Well, the first time spent soaking up the sun and South American atmosphere in Saludos Amigos was very enjoyable and felt like a bit of a break from the standard Americanisation of every character that people often assume Disney tends toward. Sadly, the second visit is a much lesser film full of weak musical numbers and recycled ideas. The plot is a simple one - Donald Duck gets a nice birthday present from his friends (including Jose Carioca) and this present allows him to get more of that South American atmosphere into his life for a little while. The first section, all about a penguin trying to reach warmer climes, is actually the highlight of the film because it doesn't feel like just an excuse to fill the screen with some designs and music from South America. Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh, because The Flying Gauchito story/poem is also quite entertaining, but the movie just overstays its welcome by a good 30 minutes or so. Donald Duck is often a lot of fun to watch on screen but his friends aren't quite so entertaining. The usual wealth of writers and directors pitched in to bring this all together and those interested in the history of animation and various styles will find plenty to enjoy (there are some nice, surreal touches that bring music vividly to life and a fun blend of animation and live action in the second half of the film) but it all feels completely superfluous after Saludos Amigos. At the time it was part of a plan to improve American relations with South American countries during WWII, and it has some historic significance, but now it's just an extra oddity that you can take or leave.

    I don't consider this one of the best of Disney, but I do think it is delightful and I also think it is a little better than Saludos Amigos. The Three Caballeros is a little too short and the opening scenes are a tad too coy for my liking, but it gets much better when and if you bear with it. The animation is stunning, with rich bold colours and the characters and backgrounds are beautifully realised. The music is also memorable and give real flavour to some of the scenes. There is also much to enjoy scenes wise, the title number is filled with energy, and You Belong to My Heart is lovely. As entertaining as Jose and Panchito are, what made the movie for me was Donald falls in love with Aurora(sister of Carmen) Miranda and gets caught up in the soundtrack. The whole scene is very charming and funny, and the animated choreography is incredible. Overall, a delightful film and worth seeing for more reasons than just historical value. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Walt Disney's outreach to the South American market resulted in a couple of films--SALUDOS AMIGOS was the first, and THE THREE CABALLEROS came next. To make a comparison, I'd have to see "SA" again, but I do recall that it had some charming musical sequences. The same is true of THE THREE CABALLEROS, especially when the musical score includes the title song (delightully done by Panchito, Jose Carioca and Donald Duck), and repeated throughout, and ballads such as YOU BELONG TO MY HEART and HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO BAIA? All of them are performed with some fantastic art work and animation combining live action and cartoon characters. The last fifteen minutes seems to be scrambling for a way to keep the viewer's attention with some explosive fireworks and a dazzling display of surrealism, minus any conception of a way to end the movie on a high note. The film itself is uneven, offering typical Disney animation for the flying donkey sequence and then resorting to over-the-top fireworks that outdo the Pink Elephants number from DUMBO. But it's hard to resist the bouncy South American flavor of the score and the charming characterizations of Donald, Panchito and Jose Carioca. The stylized conception of a Mexican Christmas by artist Mary Blair is a standout among the art work involved here, although later the pi&ntilde;ata sequence is a bit overwhelming in effects. The dazzling color and the music make it worth watching at least once, although it's hard to make a comparison between this and other Disney full-length features. Some of the action is fast and furious but the sort of thing that will appeal to very young children. Summing up: You will either love it or hate it, but if you're a Disney fan you should see it at least once.

    this is good neighbor PR to Latin America? if i was from another country and viewed this as a public relations machine i would be disturbed. i would probably think Americans and the Disney people were drinking or doing drugs or had just plain lost it. whatever, as a PR machine i just wouldn't get it. as a mind blowingly weird cartoon i understand this. it's lunacy just seems thinly disguised as a travelogue of South America. not that the depictions of South America aren't informing or often charming and musical, the overall effect just seems to make South America seem more like 'Oz' or 'Wonderland' or something. even though a lot of the information is authentic, it makes South America come off like a fantasy or fairy tale rather than something real. and it does have a tendency to make Latin Americans come off as characters in a Disney cartoon rather than real people. especially in the bathing beauty beach scene with Pato Donald. i'm not saying a lot of this isn't the usual Disney cuteness and adorability, a lot of it is. the scene where Pato Donald does a little jitterbug at a outdoor BBQ is precious cute. it's just that when 'Caballeros' gets weird, it fries hard and acidicly. like hard core acid. most of it's visuals and humour are sharp, hot headed and bitingly caustic. although hilariously funny, it sort of leaves the viewer with a sort of a hangover and a disturbed state of mind. i don't think any of this is stereotypical or racist at all. in fact the film is very reverent of South America and it's culture. rather than working as propaganda for the United States, it has a reverse effect of being propaganda for South America instead. the only problem is, having been made mostly by Anglos, i'm not sure a lot of Latinos might feel comfortable being portrayed as larger than life fantasy characters out of a Disney toon. and this does have a bad tendency to portray Latinos as "cute" and doing "cute" things like singing about cookies and doing dances with children. however there is one tough gritty moment with a traditional cock fight. cock fighting here is illegal. as sharp and acerbic as 'Caballeros' gets, it's still very cute and funny and cinematically one of Disney's best works of hand drawn animation. it just sort of makes South America seem like it only exist in fairy tales or something.

    Let me explain my summary. When you are a kid and it's Christmas, think of what it would be like if ALL the beautifully wrapped presents under the tree are actually nothing but underwear! After all, you have very high hopes....only to be bitterly disappointed. As a child, I saw this film and was psyched when it began. The film DID star Donald Duck and like all sane kids, I loved the duck. But then,....it all struck me. It was about as fun as the underwear! Singing, dancing and a travelogue! That was NOT what I'd anticipated. Years later, I rented the film again...assuming my childhood memories must have been wrong. They weren't. The film is a dull and only good to be used as a means to punish misbehaving children. I could imagine a parent saying "If you are good, I'll buy you BEAUTY AND THE BEAST...but if you're bad, THE THREE CABALLEROS!!!". Proof that not everything Disney is good. Aside from nice animation and a catchy theme song, this is dull from start to finish.

    If your kids like this film, IMDb recommends Fellini's 8&frac12;! Yeah, this one's weirder than you thought. The Three Caballeros is essentially a barely narrative series of experimental animated shorts, starting in nature film parody, progressing to a couple of early live-action/animation hybrids, and ending in a lustful interspecies psychedelic freakout--needless to say, it's an influential film. You might have to gag through some touristy Latinisms, but there's some prime Disney surrealism waiting for you if you do. -TK 11/2/10

    this is good neighbor PR to Latin America? if i was from another country and viewed this as a public relations machine i would be disturbed. i would probably think Americans and the Disney people were drinking or doing drugs or had just plain lost it. whatever, as a PR machine i just wouldn't get it. as a mind blowingly weird cartoon i understand this. it's lunacy just seems thinly disguised as a travelogue of South America. not that the depictions of South America aren't informing or often charming and musical, the overall effect just seems to make South America seem more like 'Oz' or 'Wonderland' or something. even though a lot of the information is authentic, it makes South America come off like a fantasy or fairy tale rather than something real. and it does have a tendency to make Latin Americans come off as characters in a Disney cartoon rather than real people. especially in the bathing beauty beach scene with Pato Donald. i'm not saying a lot of this isn't the usual Disney cuteness and adorability, a lot of it is. the scene where Pato Donald does a little jitterbug at a outdoor BBQ is precious cute. it's just that when 'Caballeros' gets weird, it fries hard and acidicly. like hard core acid. most of it's visuals and humour are sharp, hot headed and bitingly caustic. although hilariously funny, it sort of leaves the viewer with a sort of a hangover and a disturbed state of mind. i don't think any of this is stereotypical or racist at all. in fact the film is very reverent of South America and it's culture. rather than working as propaganda for the United States, it has a reverse effect of being propaganda for South America instead. the only problem is, having been made mostly by Anglos, i'm not sure a lot of Latinos might feel comfortable being portrayed as larger than life fantasy characters out of a Disney toon. and this does have a bad tendency to portray Latinos as "cute" and doing "cute" things like singing about cookies and doing dances with children. however there is one tough gritty moment with a traditional cock fight. cock fighting here is illegal. as sharp and acerbic as 'Caballeros' gets, it's still very cute and funny and cinematically one of Disney's best works of hand drawn animation. it just sort of makes South America seem like it only exist in fairy tales or something.

    Let me explain my summary. When you are a kid and it's Christmas, think of what it would be like if ALL the beautifully wrapped presents under the tree are actually nothing but underwear! After all, you have very high hopes....only to be bitterly disappointed. As a child, I saw this film and was psyched when it began. The film DID star Donald Duck and like all sane kids, I loved the duck. But then,....it all struck me. It was about as fun as the underwear! Singing, dancing and a travelogue! That was NOT what I'd anticipated. Years later, I rented the film again...assuming my childhood memories must have been wrong. They weren't. The film is a dull and only good to be used as a means to punish misbehaving children. I could imagine a parent saying "If you are good, I'll buy you BEAUTY AND THE BEAST...but if you're bad, THE THREE CABALLEROS!!!". Proof that not everything Disney is good. Aside from nice animation and a catchy theme song, this is dull from start to finish.

    If your kids like this film, IMDb recommends Fellini's 8&frac12;! Yeah, this one's weirder than you thought. The Three Caballeros is essentially a barely narrative series of experimental animated shorts, starting in nature film parody, progressing to a couple of early live-action/animation hybrids, and ending in a lustful interspecies psychedelic freakout--needless to say, it's an influential film. You might have to gag through some touristy Latinisms, but there's some prime Disney surrealism waiting for you if you do. -TK 11/2/10

    Walt Disney was a master at everything in the world of imagination. He made animals talk and never left you disappointed with any of his movies, that is until after his death in 1969, Disney's films slowly started to decline in quality and creativeness. However, good ones do slip in from the early 70s till even now, such as all the Herbie The Love Bug films ('69-'05), the Escape From Witch Mountain films ('73-'74), the Apple Dumpling Gang ('75-'76),Honey I Shrunk The Kids ('89-'97), The Haunted Mansion (2004), Toy Story films ('95-'10), and generally every film out of PIxar (Disney's main animation studio). Good ones do slip in, but now its decreasing more than ever. But let's get back to the golden years of Disney. You honestly never knew what was going to come out. Each film would be different. Walt Disney also made innovations in animation. Now, I'm not talking about Pixar films, but more like how groundbreaking his work was in films such as Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchico. But right now, let's talk a about one of Disney's most peculiar films, The Three Caballeros. So pack your bags for South America, cause that's where we're headed to in this review. The film follows three of Walt's bird friends, Donald Duck, Panchito, and Jose' Carioca through a surreal tour of South America. Not only is the film animated, but it also incorporates real people too, giving it a very interesting feel. Donald and his two other friends all take a look at South America and learn a story about jungle birds and a penguin in search of warmer weather. Th film is greatly entertaining despite how I am making it sound. I don't think this can be described, but just watch and see. One thing I really like about this movie is how exotic Disney makes South America look. They don't do a stereotype of it, but makes a vision of South America and what it would look like if Disney characters came on vacation there. This film is a lot of things and predictable isn't one of them. And that's one of the film's best things, you can't predict it. It's some of Walt Disney's imagination at its best. For me, I wish Walt Disney could've lived forever. His movies and characters never fail to entertain to this very day ! But looking at older Disney films really makes me get mad at what its come to today. Now its TV stations are run by Hannah Montana and the Jonas Bros. I think Walt is spinning in his grave right now; no pun intended. His company has been an absolute mess ever since they put up a Disney channel on TV. They're destroying the Disney image. I don't think Walt Disney himself has anything to do with it anymore. Its just a name now. The name of a brainwashing product designed to make money of kids and release stuff the 'teeny-boppers' and nothing else. Shows like Hannah Montana are the cause of a now new cervical cancer shot for teenagers......... Ouch !

    The Three Caballeros shows Disney at a rather innovative point combining psychedelic imagery with a catchy South American beat. Years before Yellow Submarine, The Three Caballeros brought psychedelic and surreal animation to the stage. Despite a few rocky segments at the beginning, The Three Caballeros ends with energy and visual beauty. The plot is simple, Donald is opening birthday presents (His birthday is humorously on Friday the 13th.) and meeting his old friend Jose Carioca (the Brazilian parrot) and a new friend Panchito Pistoles (the gun-slinging Mexican rooster). The lack of a strong plot and those opening segments (well, the penguin segment was alright, but really The Flying Burrito?)are more than made up in later segments, which takes the form of a travelogue through Bahia in Brazil and Mexico. First stop is Bahia with Jose where live action and animation combine o form a big pop sequence full of bright colors and rollicking samba music. Carmen Miranda's sister Aurora appears in live action singing Os Quidenes de Yaya (The Cookies of Yaya) followed by a surrealist trip through a dance hall full of brightly colored circles, musical instruments playing themselves, and roosters turning into dancers. The second part is a our tour through Mexico on the magical serape. Here Donald chases girls on the beach, dances in traditional Mexican dances and falls in love with a girl singing You Belong to My Heart in Mexico City's nightlife. Thsi leads to one of the most surreal sequences in animation history, full of bouncing flowers, girls running around in neon colors, and a horse with women's legs. This ends in a big sequence with dancing cacti. All finally ends in a fireworks display full of color, and The Three Cablleros have reprise of their signature song. Overall, style 10/10, visuals 10/10, music 10/10, plot 7/10, screenplay 8/10.

    I find it hard to believe that this was a World War II propaganda film. It doesn't really seem to fit that mold. Propaganda of the time was pretty heavy-handed, and most of it isn't all that entertaining today except as an artifact of the period. This movie is a joy to watch in its own right, and if there's an anti-fascist message embedded within, it's awfully subtle. My understanding was that this was Disney's attempt to open up Central and South America as a market for their films, since the war had pretty much eliminated the European market. Whatever its pedigree, though, this is one of the few Disney videos that I don't mind watching endlessly with the kids, especially the parts that involve the titular Caballeros. The movie is somewhat disjointed and episodic, but what holds it all together is good music. My least favorite episode is the story of the flying donkey, which gets old quickly, particularly since (and this is my one complaint) they chose to have a North American announcer attempt a Mexican accent. Why they could not have simply found an actual Mexican actor is beyond me - Los Angeles being in Mexico's backyard, after all. But Disney seemed to enjoy mixing and matching nationalities even into the 1960s, hiring, for example, US actors to play English characters in Mary Poppins, Treasure Island, and 101 Dalmatians; or Hayley Mills, who was a British actress who always seemed to be playing an American. In fact, the latter is something seen commonly nowadays, when it seems half the working actors in Hollywood are British subjects putting on American dialects (Hugh Laurie, Damian Lewis, Christian Bale).
