    Say cheese. 13 years after Will Vinton invented it, claymation is back. This short film was a milestone in animation history. The fact that Park lost the Best Animated Feature Oscar to himself that year does it no harm. He won with his three follow-up Wallace and Gromit films then, the last being a full feature. I quite like this short film, not as much as The Wrong Trousers, but more than A Close Shave. Park is on such a creative high that year that he brings us Wallace & Gromit, almost in their ultimate shape, with a great catchy tune and also already a prospect of things to come in the famous Aardman sheep on the picture at the wall of the rocket. What do you do when you realize that you've run out of cheese for your crackers. That's right. Go get some and combine with your annual holiday travel by picking the moon as the destination. After all, it's made all of cheese. Gromit's look to the camera says it all. But how did they get the cows up there? Anyway, watching this short film I had to think of French movie pioneer Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s' Trip to the Moon which shows quite a few parallels: the planning, the rocket building and finally the flight from the inhabitants. This can't be a coincidence. After they reach the moon and we get to see a short gravity joke, they run into a cleaning robot, who's quickly fed up with tidying up after the mess Wallace leaves behind after testing different moon cheese culinary meals from several corners of the moon. He is rewarded in the end for his efforts and his dream finally comes true. A must-see for animation lovers.

    Wallace And Gromit In A Grand Day Out is what started it all. Before classic short films such as "Loves Me, Loves Me Not", "Pib And Pog" and of course the other Wallace And Gromit short films and before such great films such as "Chicken Run", "Wallace And Gromit" and "Pirates: An Adventure With Scientists!" We have this wonderful short film created by Nick Park in 1989. The animation isn't as advanced as the animation used in other Aardman's short films, but it certainly brings the characters to life. The music is nostalgic, the plot is understandable for children to follow, the characters are likable and above all, its nostalgic charm makes teens and adults like it just as much as children would. The humor is just right and no childish toilet humor or mature strong language is present. All in all, it is a classic! Overall Rating: 10/10!

    When I think of Wallace and gromit I think of British with a side order of cheese with a balance of fun and scary! This one is mostly fun apart from the robot (which I'm the only one who thinks his money power will run out and be forgotten in space nowhere to be seen on google earth) even if it's more liked by children, that doesn't mean it's bad. Wallaces face is not perfected and not the best of the shorts but I still recommend it. Why? Well it's still Wallace and gromit and your still going to get some funny jokes and a happy ending plus the 2nd best version of the Wallace and gromit theme at the end credits, I really enjoy it. My Favourite parts is the end and building the rocket. Peters voice is great with some great claymation and starting a great score I recommend it!

    Although the Aardman animation (or 'claymation' if you prefer) has improved over the years, I still really love the look and feel of this short. The voice of Peter Sallis as Wallace is perfect I couldn't imagine anyone else voicing the part. I find the comic timing works to a tea and the storyline is both wacky and brilliant. There are very few things that make me laugh out loud, but there are several jokes in this film that still crack me up even 22 years later! Long may the BBC keep showing it! For me VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. My Score: 9.5/10 IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 12,962 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 100/100 (based on 19 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 36/100 'Want to See' (based on 12,098 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

    Aardman Animation started as a small company founded by Peter Lord and David Sproxton in the mid-70s. They're speciality was the almost lost art of stop-motion animation, particularly with claymation figures. They enjoyed some success with the amazing Peter Gabriel music video Sledgehammer, that was an eye-popper in its day. But the company really found its feet when novice animator Nick Park joined the studio. It was Park who would put the company on the map, and introduce two of the most endearing animated characters the world would ever see, Wallace & Gromit. The Wallace & Gromit world is a most peculiar one. Wallace is a scatterbrained inventor, always working on the next madcap invention. Gromit is his faithful dog, and much smarter than Wallace ever will be. With his incredibly expressive monobrow, he watches in silent dismay as Wallace's cock-ups get them into the wackiest adventures. Everyone of the Wallace & Gromit shorts has been a delight. So far we've seen the likes of a skiing oven, robotic trousers, a cyber-dog, a cereal killer, and with they're feature film debut, a Were-Rabbit. The films manage a perfect blend of laugh-aloud comedy and smart visual invention. My mouth always waters at the prospect of the next adventure. And A Grand Day Out is where it all began. Wallace and Gromit are lounging they're Bank Holiday away, but Wallace wants to go somewhere exotic. When there's not a piece of cheese in the house, Wallace on an impulse, decides to build a rocket ship, and fly to the Moon, where everybody knows, is a place paved with cheese. When they get there, they have to contend with a ski-obsessed oven/cooker, who won't leave them in peace. Even in they're debut, Wallace & Gromit and A Grand Day Out is a charming adventure. All of the things we would come to expect about them are plain to see, albeit in a slightly rougher, uncut form. They're characterisations have already been established, with Peter Sallis nailing Wallace's dimwitted inflections. And Aardman's love of nutty contraptions is there too. The film comes with many delightful sight gags packed around every corner. I especially liked the rocket ship's wallpapered interior, and the throwaway sight of a handbrake on the control panel. But the most inspired idea is a coin-operated oven lying neglected on the Moon. I've always been an enormous fan of silent comedy, which is one of the reasons I like Gromit so much as a character. And Park and Aardman create an intriguing character with this oven. Wisely they don't give it a voice of its own (perhaps the budget didn't allow for two voice-over artists?). Instead they just build a character out of incidental details. And its all done in total silence. Like the cooker's daydreams of skiing, giving a parking ticket to Wallace's rocket, gluing the surface of the Moon back together, trying to hit Wallace with a truncheon only for the money to run out mid-swing. Nick Park directs it all with such a light touch that the film breezes by. However, as much as I enjoyed the film, it does have its flaws. A Grand Day Out is probably the weakest of the Wallace & Gromit shorts. The animation is a little rough around the edges, and lacks the pristine sleekness of the subsequent entries. It also falls down in the plot department. All of the other Wallace & Gromit films are driven by far stronger stories. This one is quite thin. For instance, we never learn how the cooker wound up on the Moon in the first place. (You'd almost swear it was something Wallace had dreamt up). The plot, such as it is, is made to take a backseat to the (admittedly funny) visual puns and Wallace & Gromit's effortless double-act. Perhaps A Grand Day Out hasn't aged as well as the other films, but a lot of the things we've come to love about Wallace & Gromit are already in place. One area where it does have the edge is the fact that its the most conceptually ambitious. All of the other films in the series have remained earthbound, and A Grand Day Out is the only one so far to aim for something a little more profound. It touches upon themes that are rarely seen in animation today. If it had the budget accorded to The Curse of the Were-Rabbit then perhaps A Grand Day Out may have become something extraordinary, rather than just an engaging entertainment. To look at it in the harsh light of day, A Grand Day Out is really the prototype. It was The Wrong Trousers that set the style for the series, and struck up the balance between top quality writing, sidesplitting comedy and fabulous animation in all of the right places. Still, a highly promising debut nonetheless, that rightfully converted an entire nation.

    Such a basic film. Sure, it took many years and I must give the director much credit because of this. I wouldn't have the time nor patience to do something that I didn't know would or wouldn't work. The story was a bit basic, however. Going to the moon to take some cheese and eat it with your crackers. Plus, they obviously were in the story world because they didn't have any sort of gear to protect themselves. But you know, I don't really care. These days you have to have things perfect or with a good reason, else it isn't convincing. Back then people accepted things the way they were. Rated 8/10 :)

    This is the start of Wallace and Gromit,the English claymation created by the genius mind of Nick Park,it starts off with Wallace trying to find a place to go for the bank holidays, he then discovers that there is no cheese in the house, (Wallace loves cheese)so they decide to go the moon (the moon being made out of cheese in the Wallace and Gromit world)so they begin working on a space ship,once their finished while waiting for the ship to lift off they discover that they forgot about crackers (hiliarious)they then make it to the moon later on and start eating the cheese and we then discover a robotic oven who has a dream of going skiing on earth he then discovers Wallace and Gromits space ship and tries to get it started and make it to earth, a grand day out is brilliant,it may not look as good as most Wallace and Gromits but its still great.

    I was really young when I first saw this. In fact, I was an really huge fan of Wallace and Gromit even before I saw the shorts, because I have some stuffed toys of a lot of the characters from the shorts. Then I finally saw this movie, when I did, I instantly and immediately became hooked on Wallace and Gromit, I began to watch this every other day! I was really excited when I heard that there were more shorts then just this one, and I have also seen those and loved them! Stop motion is one of my favorite animation genres, because in my opinion, it seems that the more expensive an animated movie is, the better it turns out to be! All who love Wallace and Gromit must see all three of the short films that they are in, I also saw the movie, The Curse if the Were-Rabbit, and I really loved that one to! Wallace and Gromit are phenomenal! I don't know where I would be without them! 10/10

    Nick Park's Oscar-nominated first Wallace and Grommit outing is a strange and basic affair, but displaying all of the typical comic touches associated with his production. The lads run out of cheese at the weekend. So, acting upon an impulse and the myth that the moon is made of it; a rocket is hastily cobbled together and they're off into space. The moonscape is very imaginatively created. Strange lunar stalagmites of incomprehensible cheese sprout upwards conveniently for slicing. Time for a picnic. The world seems to be deserted except for a curious contraption that could only have come from Nick Park's mind. It's a cross between a domestic appliance, parking meter, and security guard. Wallace pops a coin in. It's very delayed-action, so he wanders off and leaves it. This gadget eventually switches on and assumes a strange sentience of its own. What follows is an odd-ball chase across the moon with Wallace coming within an ace of getting clobbered. This was the plasticine pair's first big-screen outing and the economies are obvious. The boys have a very coarse, unfinished appearance, unlike their smooth and slick representation in later works. If anything, they are more endearing and less stylised in this first production. Their characters are not yet fully formed. All's well that ends well. The boys blast-off home cheesated, whilst the bizarre lunar-guard learns to ski. Oddly, it seems no longer to be coin-operated. Strange and hilarious, well worth a watch. Presumably they don't live near Tesco.

    Nick Park has delighted many with his unique creations. Wallace and Gromit is the best of the lot, though Chicken Run is great too. Although this is the weakest offering from them(some of the clay was a bit runny), it is still hilarious. Wallace is superlatively voiced by Peter Sallis, and it is pretty much a one-man show. I loved Gromit, and although he never speaks, his facial expressions are priceless. I loved the idea of Wallace thinking the moon was made of cheese, and the plot never ran out of steam. The scenes on the moon, with the yellow box on wheels, were well done too. in conclusion, although this is the weakest short in terms of quality, the one that started it all is well worth watching. 9/10 Bethany Cox.

Then I finally saw this movie, when I did, I instantly and immediately became hooked on Wallace and Gromit, I began to watch this every other day! I was really excited when I heard that there were more shorts then just this one, and I have also seen those and loved them! Stop motion is one of my favorite animation genres, because in my opinion, it seems that the more expensive an animated movie is, the better it turns out to be! All who love Wallace and Gromit must see all three of the short films that they are in, I also saw the movie, The Curse if the Were-Rabbit, and I really loved that one to! Wallace and Gromit are phenomenal! I don't know where I would be without them! 10/10

    Nick Park's Oscar-nominated first Wallace and Grommit outing is a strange and basic affair, but displaying all of the typical comic touches associated with his production. The lads run out of cheese at the weekend. So, acting upon an impulse and the myth that the moon is made of it; a rocket is hastily cobbled together and they're off into space. The moonscape is very imaginatively created. Strange lunar stalagmites of incomprehensible cheese sprout upwards conveniently for slicing. Time for a picnic. The world seems to be deserted except for a curious contraption that could only have come from Nick Park's mind. It's a cross between a domestic appliance, parking meter, and security guard. Wallace pops a coin in. It's very delayed-action, so he wanders off and leaves it. This gadget eventually switches on and assumes a strange sentience of its own. What follows is an odd-ball chase across the moon with Wallace coming within an ace of getting clobbered. This was the plasticine pair's first big-screen outing and the economies are obvious. The boys have a very coarse, unfinished appearance, unlike their smooth and slick representation in later works. If anything, they are more endearing and less stylised in this first production. Their characters are not yet fully formed. All's well that ends well. The boys blast-off home cheesated, whilst the bizarre lunar-guard learns to ski. Oddly, it seems no longer to be coin-operated. Strange and hilarious, well worth a watch. Presumably they don't live near Tesco.

    Nick Park has delighted many with his unique creations. Wallace and Gromit is the best of the lot, though Chicken Run is great too. Although this is the weakest offering from them(some of the clay was a bit runny), it is still hilarious. Wallace is superlatively voiced by Peter Sallis, and it is pretty much a one-man show. I loved Gromit, and although he never speaks, his facial expressions are priceless. I loved the idea of Wallace thinking the moon was made of cheese, and the plot never ran out of steam. The scenes on the moon, with the yellow box on wheels, were well done too. in conclusion, although this is the weakest short in terms of quality, the one that started it all is well worth watching. 9/10 Bethany Cox.

    Say cheese. 13 years after Will Vinton invented it, claymation is back. This short film was a milestone in animation history. The fact that Park lost the Best Animated Feature Oscar to himself that year does it no harm. He won with his three follow-up Wallace and Gromit films then, the last being a full feature. I quite like this short film, not as much as The Wrong Trousers, but more than A Close Shave. Park is on such a creative high that year that he brings us Wallace & Gromit, almost in their ultimate shape, with a great catchy tune and also already a prospect of things to come in the famous Aardman sheep on the picture at the wall of the rocket. What do you do when you realize that you've run out of cheese for your crackers. That's right. Go get some and combine with your annual holiday travel by picking the moon as the destination. After all, it's made all of cheese. Gromit's look to the camera says it all. But how did they get the cows up there? Anyway, watching this short film I had to think of French movie pioneer Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s' Trip to the Moon which shows quite a few parallels: the planning, the rocket building and finally the flight from the inhabitants. This can't be a coincidence. After they reach the moon and we get to see a short gravity joke, they run into a cleaning robot, who's quickly fed up with tidying up after the mess Wallace leaves behind after testing different moon cheese culinary meals from several corners of the moon. He is rewarded in the end for his efforts and his dream finally comes true. A must-see for animation lovers.

    Wallace And Gromit In A Grand Day Out is what started it all. Before classic short films such as "Loves Me, Loves Me Not", "Pib And Pog" and of course the other Wallace And Gromit short films and before such great films such as "Chicken Run", "Wallace And Gromit" and "Pirates: An Adventure With Scientists!" We have this wonderful short film created by Nick Park in 1989. The animation isn't as advanced as the animation used in other Aardman's short films, but it certainly brings the characters to life. The music is nostalgic, the plot is understandable for children to follow, the characters are likable and above all, its nostalgic charm makes teens and adults like it just as much as children would. The humor is just right and no childish toilet humor or mature strong language is present. All in all, it is a classic! Overall Rating: 10/10!

    When I think of Wallace and gromit I think of British with a side order of cheese with a balance of fun and scary! This one is mostly fun apart from the robot (which I'm the only one who thinks his money power will run out and be forgotten in space nowhere to be seen on google earth) even if it's more liked by children, that doesn't mean it's bad. Wallaces face is not perfected and not the best of the shorts but I still recommend it. Why? Well it's still Wallace and gromit and your still going to get some funny jokes and a happy ending plus the 2nd best version of the Wallace and gromit theme at the end credits, I really enjoy it. My Favourite parts is the end and building the rocket. Peters voice is great with some great claymation and starting a great score I recommend it!

    Although the Aardman animation (or 'claymation' if you prefer) has improved over the years, I still really love the look and feel of this short. The voice of Peter Sallis as Wallace is perfect I couldn't imagine anyone else voicing the part. I find the comic timing works to a tea and the storyline is both wacky and brilliant. There are very few things that make me laugh out loud, but there are several jokes in this film that still crack me up even 22 years later! Long may the BBC keep showing it! For me VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. My Score: 9.5/10 IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 12,962 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 100/100 (based on 19 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 36/100 'Want to See' (based on 12,098 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

    Aardman Animation started as a small company founded by Peter Lord and David Sproxton in the mid-70s. They're speciality was the almost lost art of stop-motion animation, particularly with claymation figures. They enjoyed some success with the amazing Peter Gabriel music video Sledgehammer, that was an eye-popper in its day. But the company really found its feet when novice animator Nick Park joined the studio. It was Park who would put the company on the map, and introduce two of the most endearing animated characters the world would ever see, Wallace & Gromit. The Wallace & Gromit world is a most peculiar one. Wallace is a scatterbrained inventor, always working on the next madcap invention. Gromit is his faithful dog, and much smarter than Wallace ever will be. With his incredibly expressive monobrow, he watches in silent dismay as Wallace's cock-ups get them into the wackiest adventures. Everyone of the Wallace & Gromit shorts has been a delight. So far we've seen the likes of a skiing oven, robotic trousers, a cyber-dog, a cereal killer, and with they're feature film debut, a Were-Rabbit. The films manage a perfect blend of laugh-aloud comedy and smart visual invention. My mouth always waters at the prospect of the next adventure. And A Grand Day Out is where it all began. Wallace and Gromit are lounging they're Bank Holiday away, but Wallace wants to go somewhere exotic. When there's not a piece of cheese in the house, Wallace on an impulse, decides to build a rocket ship, and fly to the Moon, where everybody knows, is a place paved with cheese. When they get there, they have to contend with a ski-obsessed oven/cooker, who won't leave them in peace. Even in they're debut, Wallace & Gromit and A Grand Day Out is a charming adventure. All of the things we would come to expect about them are plain to see, albeit in a slightly rougher, uncut form. They're characterisations have already been established, with Peter Sallis nailing Wallace's dimwitted inflections. And Aardman's love of nutty contraptions is there too. The film comes with many delightful sight gags packed around every corner. I especially liked the rocket ship's wallpapered interior, and the throwaway sight of a handbrake on the control panel. But the most inspired idea is a coin-operated oven lying neglected on the Moon. I've always been an enormous fan of silent comedy, which is one of the reasons I like Gromit so much as a character. And Park and Aardman create an intriguing character with this oven. Wisely they don't give it a voice of its own (perhaps the budget didn't allow for two voice-over artists?). Instead they just build a character out of incidental details. And its all done in total silence. Like the cooker's daydreams of skiing, giving a parking ticket to Wallace's rocket, gluing the surface of the Moon back together, trying to hit Wallace with a truncheon only for the money to run out mid-swing. Nick Park directs it all with such a light touch that the film breezes by. However, as much as I enjoyed the film, it does have its flaws. A Grand Day Out is probably the weakest of the Wallace & Gromit shorts. The animation is a little rough around the edges, and lacks the pristine sleekness of the subsequent entries. It also falls down in the plot department. All of the other Wallace & Gromit films are driven by far stronger stories. This one is quite thin. For instance, we never learn how the cooker wound up on the Moon in the first place. (You'd almost swear it was something Wallace had dreamt up). The plot, such as it is, is made to take a backseat to the (admittedly funny) visual puns and Wallace & Gromit's effortless double-act. Perhaps A Grand Day Out hasn't aged as well as the other films, but a lot of the things we've come to love about Wallace & Gromit are already in place. One area where it does have the edge is the fact that its the most conceptually ambitious. All of the other films in the series have remained earthbound, and A Grand Day Out is the only one so far to aim for something a little more profound. It touches upon themes that are rarely seen in animation today. If it had the budget accorded to The Curse of the Were-Rabbit then perhaps A Grand Day Out may have become something extraordinary, rather than just an engaging entertainment. To look at it in the harsh light of day, A Grand Day Out is really the prototype. It was The Wrong Trousers that set the style for the series, and struck up the balance between top quality writing, sidesplitting comedy and fabulous animation in all of the right places. Still, a highly promising debut nonetheless, that rightfully converted an entire nation.

    Such a basic film. Sure, it took many years and I must give the director much credit because of this. I wouldn't have the time nor patience to do something that I didn't know would or wouldn't work. The story was a bit basic, however. Going to the moon to take some cheese and eat it with your crackers. Plus, they obviously were in the story world because they didn't have any sort of gear to protect themselves. But you know, I don't really care. These days you have to have things perfect or with a good reason, else it isn't convincing. Back then people accepted things the way they were. Rated 8/10 :)

    This is the start of Wallace and Gromit,the English claymation created by the genius mind of Nick Park,it starts off with Wallace trying to find a place to go for the bank holidays, he then discovers that there is no cheese in the house, (Wallace loves cheese)so they decide to go the moon (the moon being made out of cheese in the Wallace and Gromit world)so they begin working on a space ship,once their finished while waiting for the ship to lift off they discover that they forgot about crackers (hiliarious)they then make it to the moon later on and start eating the cheese and we then discover a robotic oven who has a dream of going skiing on earth he then discovers Wallace and Gromits space ship and tries to get it started and make it to earth, a grand day out is brilliant,it may not look as good as most Wallace and Gromits but its still great.

    Nick Park's Oscar-nominated first Wallace and Grommit outing is a strange and basic affair, but displaying all of the typical comic touches associated with his production. The lads run out of cheese at the weekend. So, acting upon an impulse and the myth that the moon is made of it; a rocket is hastily cobbled together and they're off into space. The moonscape is very imaginatively created. Strange lunar stalagmites of incomprehensible cheese sprout upwards conveniently for slicing. Time for a picnic. The world seems to be deserted except for a curious contraption that could only have come from Nick Park's mind. It's a cross between a domestic appliance, parking meter, and security guard. Wallace pops a coin in. It's very delayed-action, so he wanders off and leaves it. This gadget eventually switches on and assumes a strange sentience of its own. What follows is an odd-ball chase across the moon with Wallace coming within an ace of getting clobbered. This was the plasticine pair's first big-screen outing and the economies are obvious. The boys have a very coarse, unfinished appearance, unlike their smooth and slick representation in later works. If anything, they are more endearing and less stylised in this first production. Their characters are not yet fully formed. All's well that ends well. The boys blast-off home cheesated, whilst the bizarre lunar-guard learns to ski. Oddly, it seems no longer to be coin-operated. Strange and hilarious, well worth a watch. Presumably they don't live near Tesco.

But you know, I don't really care. These days you have to have things perfect or with a good reason, else it isn't convincing. Back then people accepted things the way they were. Rated 8/10 :)

    This is the start of Wallace and Gromit,the English claymation created by the genius mind of Nick Park,it starts off with Wallace trying to find a place to go for the bank holidays, he then discovers that there is no cheese in the house, (Wallace loves cheese)so they decide to go the moon (the moon being made out of cheese in the Wallace and Gromit world)so they begin working on a space ship,once their finished while waiting for the ship to lift off they discover that they forgot about crackers (hiliarious)they then make it to the moon later on and start eating the cheese and we then discover a robotic oven who has a dream of going skiing on earth he then discovers Wallace and Gromits space ship and tries to get it started and make it to earth, a grand day out is brilliant,it may not look as good as most Wallace and Gromits but its still great.

    I was really young when I first saw this. In fact, I was an really huge fan of Wallace and Gromit even before I saw the shorts, because I have some stuffed toys of a lot of the characters from the shorts. Then I finally saw this movie, when I did, I instantly and immediately became hooked on Wallace and Gromit, I began to watch this every other day! I was really excited when I heard that there were more shorts then just this one, and I have also seen those and loved them! Stop motion is one of my favorite animation genres, because in my opinion, it seems that the more expensive an animated movie is, the better it turns out to be! All who love Wallace and Gromit must see all three of the short films that they are in, I also saw the movie, The Curse if the Were-Rabbit, and I really loved that one to! Wallace and Gromit are phenomenal! I don't know where I would be without them! 10/10

    Nick Park's Oscar-nominated first Wallace and Grommit outing is a strange and basic affair, but displaying all of the typical comic touches associated with his production. The lads run out of cheese at the weekend. So, acting upon an impulse and the myth that the moon is made of it; a rocket is hastily cobbled together and they're off into space. The moonscape is very imaginatively created. Strange lunar stalagmites of incomprehensible cheese sprout upwards conveniently for slicing. Time for a picnic. The world seems to be deserted except for a curious contraption that could only have come from Nick Park's mind. It's a cross between a domestic appliance, parking meter, and security guard. Wallace pops a coin in. It's very delayed-action, so he wanders off and leaves it. This gadget eventually switches on and assumes a strange sentience of its own. What follows is an odd-ball chase across the moon with Wallace coming within an ace of getting clobbered. This was the plasticine pair's first big-screen outing and the economies are obvious. The boys have a very coarse, unfinished appearance, unlike their smooth and slick representation in later works. If anything, they are more endearing and less stylised in this first production. Their characters are not yet fully formed. All's well that ends well. The boys blast-off home cheesated, whilst the bizarre lunar-guard learns to ski. Oddly, it seems no longer to be coin-operated. Strange and hilarious, well worth a watch. Presumably they don't live near Tesco.

    The weakest of the Wallace and Gromit episodes is still well worth watching!

    Nick Park has delighted many with his unique creations. Wallace and Gromit is the best of the lot, though Chicken Run is great too. Although this is the weakest offering from them(some of the clay was a bit runny), it is still hilarious. Wallace is superlatively voiced by Peter Sallis, and it is pretty much a one-man show. I loved Gromit, and although he never speaks, his facial expressions are priceless. I loved the idea of Wallace thinking the moon was made of cheese, and the plot never ran out of steam. The scenes on the moon, with the yellow box on wheels, were well done too. in conclusion, although this is the weakest short in terms of quality, the one that started it all is well worth watching. 9/10 Bethany Cox.
