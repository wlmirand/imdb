    "Johnny Mnemonic" for many people considered as the harbinger of "The Matrix", but in any case we must not compare these two films. "Johnny Mnemonic" is a really different film from "The Matrix" with a lower budget and a lower improvement from the side of technology. It's a nice movie with a good performance by Keanu Reeves as Johnny Mnemonic and wonderful Dina Meyer as Jane. Ice-T as J-Bone and Takeshi Kitano as Takahashi made a good performances too. The story of this movie regards a man who use his mind as a hard drive and his self as a data courier to deliver packages from one man to another. One package is too big to deliver it but he gets this risk, so he want to deliver it as fast as he can not die from it.

    Dreary SF clunker with a typically uncharismatic Keanu Reeves as the title character, a courier who delivers data by carrying it around in an implant in his head, an upgrade that necessitated dumping portions of his long-term memory (including his acting classes, apparently). An intriguing premise is duly farted away thanks to a stillborn screenplay, flat direction, poor performances and gloomy music; what might have been an exciting thriller along the lines of 'Total Recall' has crawled onto the screen as a muddled, disappointing misfire. There are a couple of rewards along the way, such as the internet sequences, people getting sliced in half back when the visual was a fresh idea, and Dina Meyer, who I fancied like mad at the time.

    I've got a bit of a problem writing this review because immediately after seeing JOHNNY MNEMONIC I can hardly recall a thing about it . If I remember correctly it involves Keanu Reeves playing Keanu Reeves getting something downloaded in to his head and going somewhere to download it in to something and constantly bumping in to foul mouthed non actors every ten minutes . Have I got that right ? The screenplay is written by William Gibson , the purveyor of a science fiction of sub-genre called Cyberpunk which was very popular in the late 1989s and early 1990s but didn't translate at all well in to cinema . Without doubt the most successful Cyberpunk movie was the original version of THE MATRIX and as the sequels even the success of that film was probably down to a case of style over substance . The problem with JM is that too is trying to be style over substance and there's very little style to it It's a film trying to emulate the look of BLADERUNNER but director Robert Longo is no Ridley Scott . He also doesn't do his cause any good by casting Henry Rollins and Ice-T who give the impression they think they were going to be appearing in a cool hip movie only to find they weren't and reacted by giving disinterested performances . The worst aspect is the cinematography were everything is so dimly lit that it's impossible to see what is going on in the background or indeed if there is anything going on the background . Add to this a storyline that is often confusing then you've got a film that fails to hold the interest and is difficult to remember moments after seeing it

    Johnny (Keanu Reeves) lives in 2021. In this world, there is such an overload of technology and instant information from the Internet, that no one's secrets are safe online. For this reason, some men, like Johnny, have had part of their brains removed so that these anatomical parts can hold microchip data. Thus, they are modern couriers who deliver important documents to and fro. Also, the disparity between rich and poor is very prominent, with lots of street people and a few big wigs. Johnny is lucky to be sort of in the middle. One day, Johnny's head is loaded with information from a Japanese firm but there is trouble straight away. First, as Johnny goes to the bathroom, the men who gave him the data are assassinated. Our John barely gets away. Needing the help of some street folks like Jane (Dina Meyer), Spider (Henry Rollins) and J-Bone (Ice-T), the courier learns his brain is way overloaded and he will die if he can't find someone to accept the data. Naturally, the information is ultra-important for the world's health. His boss (Udo Kier) is a double-crosser, so he's no help. Also, a demonic street preacher (Dolph Lundgren) is put on his trail and told to eliminate Johnny. Who will be the last man standing? This story is really intriguing and science fiction fans would love to embrace it wholeheartedly. Unfortunately, the violence is over the top and damages the final product. Reeves does a fine job and looks great while the others do nice work, too, so the viewer does want to keep watching for their sakes. Also of tremendous quality are the special effects and art direction. If you like sci-fi, you might want to give this one a whirl but stay away if blood-and-gore is not your cup of tea.

    Usually when you watch a sci-fi film, the first half usually piques your interest only to sink into a confusing and badly written second half ("Star Trek V" comes to mind.). "Johnny Mnemonic" has the unique distinction of having a rather bad first half being saved by the second half. There were moments of badly delivered lines and situations, which I fully blame the director for. There were cuts where the demeanor of Keanu Reeves changed confusingly. Again I blame the director and continuity supervisor. There was, IMHO, more gore than necessary. But that's a matter of taste. And, to make matters worse, I wasn't sure of what I was watching. There was a LOT of good things about the movie. It told a sci-fi story about a dark and bleak future....somewhat similar to "Blade Runner". And it did it well. There were an amazing amount of sets, extras, and really well done computer effects. There was even one really well filmed shot in a hospital that reminded me of the long scene from "Gone With The Wind" showing the dead and dying in the Atlanta train yard. Many of the secondary actors (especially Henry Rollins as "Spider" and Ice-T as "J-Bone") were surprisingly good and helped to raise my rating of the film from an initial 4.0 to an overall 7.0 rating. If you aren't into a lot of foul language and/or gore, I'd steer clear of this film. But if you want to see a surprisingly well made piece of dark sci-fi, this is a film worth giving a chance to watch.

    I agree with Leonard Maltin's assessment of this movie-it's an intriguing idea that really doesn't get anywhere. The year is 2021, the internet has everyone trapped, and people are suffering from a disease called NAS. Keanu Reeves's character has a chip implanted in his brain that carries the cure, and the bad guys are after both him and it, trying to hunt them down, and a mysterious lady and some other characters are helping him. The movie was OK. Not bad, not great-just OK. My favorite scene was in the junkyard when the helicopter bad guys tried to bomb him, and Reeves gave a speech with some great lines. The special effects were great and were the film's real highlight, but other than that the film didn't have too much to recommend unless you're a scifi and action fan. ** out of ****

    Look, there is no arguing that this movie is dated and is rapidly becoming moreso. However, that does not change the fact that this cyberpunk gem stands firmly between Craig Baldwin's underground Spectres of the Spectrum and the Wachowski's mainstream hit The Matrix as a camp rebellion of digital overload in fetish costuming and grungy spectacle. Gibson provides the meat, Longo provides the gusto. From there, it's only a matter of wishing the acting was better and the graphics more advanced. However, digital effects had to develop somewhere between The Crow and Avatar. Hell, there's still an audience for this: why do you think cult filmgoers are turning out in droves for Repo: the Genetic Opera, arguably the musical version of this? Keanu Reeves plays an unknown prelude to his Neo role via postlude to his Bill and Ted role. To me, this works. For others, I can see what their problem is. But even beyond that, you still have Takeshi Kitano and Henry Rollins to contend with, and they take to their roles without any hesitation, and the result is good. You also have the, in my mind always appealing, assets in radiowave revolutionaries who fight the corporate machine in dirty reverse-engineered hacker lairs while still finding time to put on fantastic make-up and pleather over mesh clothing, Yakuza gangsters with katanas, guns, and lazer-strengthened piano wire, and tripped out mercenaries looking for a client while desperately staving off a tweaked-out race against time. Oh, and hacker dolphins. YEAH YOU HEARD ME. Hacker dolphins. So hate this movie if you want but this is the roots of all cyberpunk entertainment to me. --PolarisDiB

    I saw it shortly after it was released and I really liked it. At the time I had read several cyberpunk novels including some by William Gibson and to me. the movie seemed to capture the atmosphere of some of the novels very well. I found young Keanu Reeves highly credible as a surgically enhanced human (he'd be credible as a projection of artificial life...). I enjoyed the movie a lot and to this day I think it is a great adaptation of a cyberpunk novel to cinema. I did not give it a 10 because at times it seems too slavishly following the book and some reinterpretations for cinema might have benefited the movie. I have watched it maybe every 5 years since it was released and liked it a lot every time.

    In the year 2021, "Keanu Reeves is a space-age courier who's plugged in, turned on, and buffed up to deliver the most important data of the 21st century, wet-wired directly into his brain," according to the DVD sleeve's description. What Mr. Reeves doesn't know is that his latest download may be connected to the cure for the computer era's most deadly disease, a malady called Nerve Attenuation Syndrome (NAS). Everyone in the future seems to be at risk for NAS - something like this will probably happen in real life. Even Reeves' bodyguard, sexy Dina Meyer (as Jane), is afflicted. Needless to say, our hero and Ms. Meyer find themselves in mortal danger. Nasty Takeshi Kitano (as Takahashi) is willing to chop off Reeves' eyebrow-plucked head to get the valuable data loaded in the handsome courier's brain, but he'll have to beat dangerous street preacher Dolph Lundgren (as Karl) to the punch. Rapper Ice-T (as J-Bone) and rocker Henry Rollins (as Spider) join Meyer in trying to keep Reeves' from losing his head. Director Robert Longo brings writer William Gibson's story to the screen with some arresting visuals; but, their "Johnny Mnemonic" is disappointing. The bigger names in the cast seem unfocused, with only Mr. Lundgren and some of the minor characters providing focused characterizations. ***** Johnny Mnemonic (4/15/95) Robert Longo ~ Keanu Reeves, Dina Meyer, Ice-T, Dolph Lundgren

    Before "The Matrix" trilogy, Keanu Reeves starred in this cyberpunk film about a "data carrier" who gets entangled in a half baked tale of techno-espionage. The film was based on a great short story by legendary author William Gibson (who coined the term cyberspace), but the film itself doesn't have the budget or talent necessary to make Gibson's dystopian future come to life. Today the film is notable for several "virtual reality" sequences in which Keanu Reeves uses "cybernetic gloves" to navigate a futuristic version of "the internet". Sequences like this were found in many similar films at the time. For example, "Hackers", "Lawnmower Man", "Sneakers", "Tron", "Blade Runner" etc, all have scenes in which heroes use "interfaces" to "enter an image" or "program" and "find information". This was a big deal back in the days, but today you can find similar interactive sequences in everything from "Virtuosity" to "Minority Report". Interestingly, the best of these scenes is still "Blade Runner", with its rather low tech approach. In Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner", Harrison Ford uses a computer to slowly navigate his way through a simple celluloid photograph. Compare this to the wild arm movements, jazzy special effects, needless classical music and loud camera work of Tom Cruise's "data scrub" in "Minority Report". But more importantly, watch how the images in Spielberg's "data scrub" sequences are two dimensional, and watch how the sequences in "Blade Runner" and "Johnny Mneumonic" all stress three dimensional space. 6/10  The "virtual reality sequences" in this film were outsourced to another production team, which is why they are the only things, for historical purposes, worth watching here. They're pretty cool sequences, Keanu Reeves literally tearing through a futuristic version of the internet with dancing hands and electronic gloves. One scene can be watched on youtube by typing "Johnny Mnemonic Future Internet" in the search bar. Before modems and personal computers were commonplace, this is how artists perceived our cyber-future. Worth one viewing.

    Before "The Matrix" trilogy, Keanu Reeves starred in this cyberpunk film about a "data carrier" who gets entangled in a half baked tale of techno-espionage. The film was based on a great short story by legendary author William Gibson (who coined the term cyberspace), but the film itself doesn't have the budget or talent necessary to make Gibson's dystopian future come to life. Today the film is notable for several "virtual reality" sequences in which Keanu Reeves uses "cybernetic gloves" to navigate a futuristic version of "the internet". Sequences like this were found in many similar films at the time. For example, "Hackers", "Lawnmower Man", "Sneakers", "Tron", "Blade Runner" etc, all have scenes in which heroes use "interfaces" to "enter an image" or "program" and "find information". This was a big deal back in the days, but today you can find similar interactive sequences in everything from "Virtuosity" to "Minority Report". Interestingly, the best of these scenes is still "Blade Runner", with its rather low tech approach. In Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner", Harrison Ford uses a computer to slowly navigate his way through a simple celluloid photograph. Compare this to the wild arm movements, jazzy special effects, needless classical music and loud camera work of Tom Cruise's "data scrub" in "Minority Report". But more importantly, watch how the images in Spielberg's "data scrub" sequences are two dimensional, and watch how the sequences in "Blade Runner" and "Johnny Mneumonic" all stress three dimensional space. 6/10  The "virtual reality sequences" in this film were outsourced to another production team, which is why they are the only things, for historical purposes, worth watching here. They're pretty cool sequences, Keanu Reeves literally tearing through a futuristic version of the internet with dancing hands and electronic gloves. One scene can be watched on youtube by typing "Johnny Mnemonic Future Internet" in the search bar. Before modems and personal computers were commonplace, this is how artists perceived our cyber-future. Worth one viewing.

    "Johnny Mnemonic" for many people considered as the harbinger of "The Matrix", but in any case we must not compare these two films. "Johnny Mnemonic" is a really different film from "The Matrix" with a lower budget and a lower improvement from the side of technology. It's a nice movie with a good performance by Keanu Reeves as Johnny Mnemonic and wonderful Dina Meyer as Jane. Ice-T as J-Bone and Takeshi Kitano as Takahashi made a good performances too. The story of this movie regards a man who use his mind as a hard drive and his self as a data courier to deliver packages from one man to another. One package is too big to deliver it but he gets this risk, so he want to deliver it as fast as he can not die from it.

    Dreary SF clunker with a typically uncharismatic Keanu Reeves as the title character, a courier who delivers data by carrying it around in an implant in his head, an upgrade that necessitated dumping portions of his long-term memory (including his acting classes, apparently). An intriguing premise is duly farted away thanks to a stillborn screenplay, flat direction, poor performances and gloomy music; what might have been an exciting thriller along the lines of 'Total Recall' has crawled onto the screen as a muddled, disappointing misfire. There are a couple of rewards along the way, such as the internet sequences, people getting sliced in half back when the visual was a fresh idea, and Dina Meyer, who I fancied like mad at the time.

    I've got a bit of a problem writing this review because immediately after seeing JOHNNY MNEMONIC I can hardly recall a thing about it . If I remember correctly it involves Keanu Reeves playing Keanu Reeves getting something downloaded in to his head and going somewhere to download it in to something and constantly bumping in to foul mouthed non actors every ten minutes . Have I got that right ? The screenplay is written by William Gibson , the purveyor of a science fiction of sub-genre called Cyberpunk which was very popular in the late 1989s and early 1990s but didn't translate at all well in to cinema . Without doubt the most successful Cyberpunk movie was the original version of THE MATRIX and as the sequels even the success of that film was probably down to a case of style over substance . The problem with JM is that too is trying to be style over substance and there's very little style to it It's a film trying to emulate the look of BLADERUNNER but director Robert Longo is no Ridley Scott . He also doesn't do his cause any good by casting Henry Rollins and Ice-T who give the impression they think they were going to be appearing in a cool hip movie only to find they weren't and reacted by giving disinterested performances . The worst aspect is the cinematography were everything is so dimly lit that it's impossible to see what is going on in the background or indeed if there is anything going on the background . Add to this a storyline that is often confusing then you've got a film that fails to hold the interest and is difficult to remember moments after seeing it

    Johnny (Keanu Reeves) lives in 2021. In this world, there is such an overload of technology and instant information from the Internet, that no one's secrets are safe online. For this reason, some men, like Johnny, have had part of their brains removed so that these anatomical parts can hold microchip data. Thus, they are modern couriers who deliver important documents to and fro. Also, the disparity between rich and poor is very prominent, with lots of street people and a few big wigs. Johnny is lucky to be sort of in the middle. One day, Johnny's head is loaded with information from a Japanese firm but there is trouble straight away. First, as Johnny goes to the bathroom, the men who gave him the data are assassinated. Our John barely gets away. Needing the help of some street folks like Jane (Dina Meyer), Spider (Henry Rollins) and J-Bone (Ice-T), the courier learns his brain is way overloaded and he will die if he can't find someone to accept the data. Naturally, the information is ultra-important for the world's health. His boss (Udo Kier) is a double-crosser, so he's no help. Also, a demonic street preacher (Dolph Lundgren) is put on his trail and told to eliminate Johnny. Who will be the last man standing? This story is really intriguing and science fiction fans would love to embrace it wholeheartedly. Unfortunately, the violence is over the top and damages the final product. Reeves does a fine job and looks great while the others do nice work, too, so the viewer does want to keep watching for their sakes. Also of tremendous quality are the special effects and art direction. If you like sci-fi, you might want to give this one a whirl but stay away if blood-and-gore is not your cup of tea.

    Usually when you watch a sci-fi film, the first half usually piques your interest only to sink into a confusing and badly written second half ("Star Trek V" comes to mind.). "Johnny Mnemonic" has the unique distinction of having a rather bad first half being saved by the second half. There were moments of badly delivered lines and situations, which I fully blame the director for. There were cuts where the demeanor of Keanu Reeves changed confusingly. Again I blame the director and continuity supervisor. There was, IMHO, more gore than necessary. But that's a matter of taste. And, to make matters worse, I wasn't sure of what I was watching. There was a LOT of good things about the movie. It told a sci-fi story about a dark and bleak future....somewhat similar to "Blade Runner". And it did it well. There were an amazing amount of sets, extras, and really well done computer effects. There was even one really well filmed shot in a hospital that reminded me of the long scene from "Gone With The Wind" showing the dead and dying in the Atlanta train yard. Many of the secondary actors (especially Henry Rollins as "Spider" and Ice-T as "J-Bone") were surprisingly good and helped to raise my rating of the film from an initial 4.0 to an overall 7.0 rating. If you aren't into a lot of foul language and/or gore, I'd steer clear of this film. But if you want to see a surprisingly well made piece of dark sci-fi, this is a film worth giving a chance to watch.

    I agree with Leonard Maltin's assessment of this movie-it's an intriguing idea that really doesn't get anywhere. The year is 2021, the internet has everyone trapped, and people are suffering from a disease called NAS. Keanu Reeves's character has a chip implanted in his brain that carries the cure, and the bad guys are after both him and it, trying to hunt them down, and a mysterious lady and some other characters are helping him. The movie was OK. Not bad, not great-just OK. My favorite scene was in the junkyard when the helicopter bad guys tried to bomb him, and Reeves gave a speech with some great lines. The special effects were great and were the film's real highlight, but other than that the film didn't have too much to recommend unless you're a scifi and action fan. ** out of ****

    Look, there is no arguing that this movie is dated and is rapidly becoming moreso. However, that does not change the fact that this cyberpunk gem stands firmly between Craig Baldwin's underground Spectres of the Spectrum and the Wachowski's mainstream hit The Matrix as a camp rebellion of digital overload in fetish costuming and grungy spectacle. Gibson provides the meat, Longo provides the gusto. From there, it's only a matter of wishing the acting was better and the graphics more advanced. However, digital effects had to develop somewhere between The Crow and Avatar. Hell, there's still an audience for this: why do you think cult filmgoers are turning out in droves for Repo: the Genetic Opera, arguably the musical version of this? Keanu Reeves plays an unknown prelude to his Neo role via postlude to his Bill and Ted role. To me, this works. For others, I can see what their problem is. But even beyond that, you still have Takeshi Kitano and Henry Rollins to contend with, and they take to their roles without any hesitation, and the result is good. You also have the, in my mind always appealing, assets in radiowave revolutionaries who fight the corporate machine in dirty reverse-engineered hacker lairs while still finding time to put on fantastic make-up and pleather over mesh clothing, Yakuza gangsters with katanas, guns, and lazer-strengthened piano wire, and tripped out mercenaries looking for a client while desperately staving off a tweaked-out race against time. Oh, and hacker dolphins. YEAH YOU HEARD ME. Hacker dolphins. So hate this movie if you want but this is the roots of all cyberpunk entertainment to me. --PolarisDiB

    I saw it shortly after it was released and I really liked it. At the time I had read several cyberpunk novels including some by William Gibson and to me. the movie seemed to capture the atmosphere of some of the novels very well. I found young Keanu Reeves highly credible as a surgically enhanced human (he'd be credible as a projection of artificial life...). I enjoyed the movie a lot and to this day I think it is a great adaptation of a cyberpunk novel to cinema. I did not give it a 10 because at times it seems too slavishly following the book and some reinterpretations for cinema might have benefited the movie. I have watched it maybe every 5 years since it was released and liked it a lot every time.

    In the year 2021, "Keanu Reeves is a space-age courier who's plugged in, turned on, and buffed up to deliver the most important data of the 21st century, wet-wired directly into his brain," according to the DVD sleeve's description. What Mr. Reeves doesn't know is that his latest download may be connected to the cure for the computer era's most deadly disease, a malady called Nerve Attenuation Syndrome (NAS). Everyone in the future seems to be at risk for NAS - something like this will probably happen in real life. Even Reeves' bodyguard, sexy Dina Meyer (as Jane), is afflicted. Needless to say, our hero and Ms. Meyer find themselves in mortal danger. Nasty Takeshi Kitano (as Takahashi) is willing to chop off Reeves' eyebrow-plucked head to get the valuable data loaded in the handsome courier's brain, but he'll have to beat dangerous street preacher Dolph Lundgren (as Karl) to the punch. Rapper Ice-T (as J-Bone) and rocker Henry Rollins (as Spider) join Meyer in trying to keep Reeves' from losing his head. Director Robert Longo brings writer William Gibson's story to the screen with some arresting visuals; but, their "Johnny Mnemonic" is disappointing. The bigger names in the cast seem unfocused, with only Mr. Lundgren and some of the minor characters providing focused characterizations. ***** Johnny Mnemonic (4/15/95) Robert Longo ~ Keanu Reeves, Dina Meyer, Ice-T, Dolph Lundgren

    Before "The Matrix" trilogy, Keanu Reeves starred in this cyberpunk film about a "data carrier" who gets entangled in a half baked tale of techno-espionage. The film was based on a great short story by legendary author William Gibson (who coined the term cyberspace), but the film itself doesn't have the budget or talent necessary to make Gibson's dystopian future come to life. Today the film is notable for several "virtual reality" sequences in which Keanu Reeves uses "cybernetic gloves" to navigate a futuristic version of "the internet". Sequences like this were found in many similar films at the time. For example, "Hackers", "Lawnmower Man", "Sneakers", "Tron", "Blade Runner" etc, all have scenes in which heroes use "interfaces" to "enter an image" or "program" and "find information". This was a big deal back in the days, but today you can find similar interactive sequences in everything from "Virtuosity" to "Minority Report". Interestingly, the best of these scenes is still "Blade Runner", with its rather low tech approach. In Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner", Harrison Ford uses a computer to slowly navigate his way through a simple celluloid photograph. Compare this to the wild arm movements, jazzy special effects, needless classical music and loud camera work of Tom Cruise's "data scrub" in "Minority Report". But more importantly, watch how the images in Spielberg's "data scrub" sequences are two dimensional, and watch how the sequences in "Blade Runner" and "Johnny Mneumonic" all stress three dimensional space. 6/10  The "virtual reality sequences" in this film were outsourced to another production team, which is why they are the only things, for historical purposes, worth watching here. They're pretty cool sequences, Keanu Reeves literally tearing through a futuristic version of the internet with dancing hands and electronic gloves. One scene can be watched on youtube by typing "Johnny Mnemonic Future Internet" in the search bar. Before modems and personal computers were commonplace, this is how artists perceived our cyber-future. Worth one viewing.

    "Johnny Mnemonic" for many people considered as the harbinger of "The Matrix", but in any case we must not compare these two films. "Johnny Mnemonic" is a really different film from "The Matrix" with a lower budget and a lower improvement from the side of technology. It's a nice movie with a good performance by Keanu Reeves as Johnny Mnemonic and wonderful Dina Meyer as Jane. Ice-T as J-Bone and Takeshi Kitano as Takahashi made a good performances too. The story of this movie regards a man who use his mind as a hard drive and his self as a data courier to deliver packages from one man to another. One package is too big to deliver it but he gets this risk, so he want to deliver it as fast as he can not die from it.

    Dreary SF clunker with a typically uncharismatic Keanu Reeves as the title character, a courier who delivers data by carrying it around in an implant in his head, an upgrade that necessitated dumping portions of his long-term memory (including his acting classes, apparently). An intriguing premise is duly farted away thanks to a stillborn screenplay, flat direction, poor performances and gloomy music; what might have been an exciting thriller along the lines of 'Total Recall' has crawled onto the screen as a muddled, disappointing misfire. There are a couple of rewards along the way, such as the internet sequences, people getting sliced in half back when the visual was a fresh idea, and Dina Meyer, who I fancied like mad at the time.

    I've got a bit of a problem writing this review because immediately after seeing JOHNNY MNEMONIC I can hardly recall a thing about it . If I remember correctly it involves Keanu Reeves playing Keanu Reeves getting something downloaded in to his head and going somewhere to download it in to something and constantly bumping in to foul mouthed non actors every ten minutes . Have I got that right ? The screenplay is written by William Gibson , the purveyor of a science fiction of sub-genre called Cyberpunk which was very popular in the late 1989s and early 1990s but didn't translate at all well in to cinema . Without doubt the most successful Cyberpunk movie was the original version of THE MATRIX and as the sequels even the success of that film was probably down to a case of style over substance . The problem with JM is that too is trying to be style over substance and there's very little style to it It's a film trying to emulate the look of BLADERUNNER but director Robert Longo is no Ridley Scott . He also doesn't do his cause any good by casting Henry Rollins and Ice-T who give the impression they think they were going to be appearing in a cool hip movie only to find they weren't and reacted by giving disinterested performances . The worst aspect is the cinematography were everything is so dimly lit that it's impossible to see what is going on in the background or indeed if there is anything going on the background . Add to this a storyline that is often confusing then you've got a film that fails to hold the interest and is difficult to remember moments after seeing it

    Johnny (Keanu Reeves) lives in 2021. In this world, there is such an overload of technology and instant information from the Internet, that no one's secrets are safe online. For this reason, some men, like Johnny, have had part of their brains removed so that these anatomical parts can hold microchip data. Thus, they are modern couriers who deliver important documents to and fro. Also, the disparity between rich and poor is very prominent, with lots of street people and a few big wigs. Johnny is lucky to be sort of in the middle. One day, Johnny's head is loaded with information from a Japanese firm but there is trouble straight away. First, as Johnny goes to the bathroom, the men who gave him the data are assassinated. Our John barely gets away. Needing the help of some street folks like Jane (Dina Meyer), Spider (Henry Rollins) and J-Bone (Ice-T), the courier learns his brain is way overloaded and he will die if he can't find someone to accept the data. Naturally, the information is ultra-important for the world's health. His boss (Udo Kier) is a double-crosser, so he's no help. Also, a demonic street preacher (Dolph Lundgren) is put on his trail and told to eliminate Johnny. Who will be the last man standing? This story is really intriguing and science fiction fans would love to embrace it wholeheartedly. Unfortunately, the violence is over the top and damages the final product. Reeves does a fine job and looks great while the others do nice work, too, so the viewer does want to keep watching for their sakes. Also of tremendous quality are the special effects and art direction. If you like sci-fi, you might want to give this one a whirl but stay away if blood-and-gore is not your cup of tea.

    Usually when you watch a sci-fi film, the first half usually piques your interest only to sink into a confusing and badly written second half ("Star Trek V" comes to mind.). "Johnny Mnemonic" has the unique distinction of having a rather bad first half being saved by the second half. There were moments of badly delivered lines and situations, which I fully blame the director for. There were cuts where the demeanor of Keanu Reeves changed confusingly. Again I blame the director and continuity supervisor. There was, IMHO, more gore than necessary. But that's a matter of taste. And, to make matters worse, I wasn't sure of what I was watching. There was a LOT of good things about the movie. It told a sci-fi story about a dark and bleak future....somewhat similar to "Blade Runner". And it did it well. There were an amazing amount of sets, extras, and really well done computer effects. There was even one really well filmed shot in a hospital that reminded me of the long scene from "Gone With The Wind" showing the dead and dying in the Atlanta train yard. Many of the secondary actors (especially Henry Rollins as "Spider" and Ice-T as "J-Bone") were surprisingly good and helped to raise my rating of the film from an initial 4.0 to an overall 7.0 rating. If you aren't into a lot of foul language and/or gore, I'd steer clear of this film. But if you want to see a surprisingly well made piece of dark sci-fi, this is a film worth giving a chance to watch.

    I agree with Leonard Maltin's assessment of this movie-it's an intriguing idea that really doesn't get anywhere. The year is 2021, the internet has everyone trapped, and people are suffering from a disease called NAS. Keanu Reeves's character has a chip implanted in his brain that carries the cure, and the bad guys are after both him and it, trying to hunt them down, and a mysterious lady and some other characters are helping him. The movie was OK. Not bad, not great-just OK. My favorite scene was in the junkyard when the helicopter bad guys tried to bomb him, and Reeves gave a speech with some great lines. The special effects were great and were the film's real highlight, but other than that the film didn't have too much to recommend unless you're a scifi and action fan. ** out of ****

    Look, there is no arguing that this movie is dated and is rapidly becoming moreso. However, that does not change the fact that this cyberpunk gem stands firmly between Craig Baldwin's underground Spectres of the Spectrum and the Wachowski's mainstream hit The Matrix as a camp rebellion of digital overload in fetish costuming and grungy spectacle. Gibson provides the meat, Longo provides the gusto. From there, it's only a matter of wishing the acting was better and the graphics more advanced. However, digital effects had to develop somewhere between The Crow and Avatar. Hell, there's still an audience for this: why do you think cult filmgoers are turning out in droves for Repo: the Genetic Opera, arguably the musical version of this? Keanu Reeves plays an unknown prelude to his Neo role via postlude to his Bill and Ted role. To me, this works. For others, I can see what their problem is. But even beyond that, you still have Takeshi Kitano and Henry Rollins to contend with, and they take to their roles without any hesitation, and the result is good. You also have the, in my mind always appealing, assets in radiowave revolutionaries who fight the corporate machine in dirty reverse-engineered hacker lairs while still finding time to put on fantastic make-up and pleather over mesh clothing, Yakuza gangsters with katanas, guns, and lazer-strengthened piano wire, and tripped out mercenaries looking for a client while desperately staving off a tweaked-out race against time. Oh, and hacker dolphins. YEAH YOU HEARD ME. Hacker dolphins. So hate this movie if you want but this is the roots of all cyberpunk entertainment to me. --PolarisDiB

    I saw it shortly after it was released and I really liked it. At the time I had read several cyberpunk novels including some by William Gibson and to me. the movie seemed to capture the atmosphere of some of the novels very well. I found young Keanu Reeves highly credible as a surgically enhanced human (he'd be credible as a projection of artificial life...). I enjoyed the movie a lot and to this day I think it is a great adaptation of a cyberpunk novel to cinema. I did not give it a 10 because at times it seems too slavishly following the book and some reinterpretations for cinema might have benefited the movie. I have watched it maybe every 5 years since it was released and liked it a lot every time.

    In the year 2021, "Keanu Reeves is a space-age courier who's plugged in, turned on, and buffed up to deliver the most important data of the 21st century, wet-wired directly into his brain," according to the DVD sleeve's description. What Mr. Reeves doesn't know is that his latest download may be connected to the cure for the computer era's most deadly disease, a malady called Nerve Attenuation Syndrome (NAS). Everyone in the future seems to be at risk for NAS - something like this will probably happen in real life. Even Reeves' bodyguard, sexy Dina Meyer (as Jane), is afflicted. Needless to say, our hero and Ms. Meyer find themselves in mortal danger. Nasty Takeshi Kitano (as Takahashi) is willing to chop off Reeves' eyebrow-plucked head to get the valuable data loaded in the handsome courier's brain, but he'll have to beat dangerous street preacher Dolph Lundgren (as Karl) to the punch. Rapper Ice-T (as J-Bone) and rocker Henry Rollins (as Spider) join Meyer in trying to keep Reeves' from losing his head. Director Robert Longo brings writer William Gibson's story to the screen with some arresting visuals; but, their "Johnny Mnemonic" is disappointing. The bigger names in the cast seem unfocused, with only Mr. Lundgren and some of the minor characters providing focused characterizations. ***** Johnny Mnemonic (4/15/95) Robert Longo ~ Keanu Reeves, Dina Meyer, Ice-T, Dolph Lundgren

    Before "The Matrix" trilogy, Keanu Reeves starred in this cyberpunk film about a "data carrier" who gets entangled in a half baked tale of techno-espionage. The film was based on a great short story by legendary author William Gibson (who coined the term cyberspace), but the film itself doesn't have the budget or talent necessary to make Gibson's dystopian future come to life. Today the film is notable for several "virtual reality" sequences in which Keanu Reeves uses "cybernetic gloves" to navigate a futuristic version of "the internet". Sequences like this were found in many similar films at the time. For example, "Hackers", "Lawnmower Man", "Sneakers", "Tron", "Blade Runner" etc, all have scenes in which heroes use "interfaces" to "enter an image" or "program" and "find information". This was a big deal back in the days, but today you can find similar interactive sequences in everything from "Virtuosity" to "Minority Report". Interestingly, the best of these scenes is still "Blade Runner", with its rather low tech approach. In Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner", Harrison Ford uses a computer to slowly navigate his way through a simple celluloid photograph. Compare this to the wild arm movements, jazzy special effects, needless classical music and loud camera work of Tom Cruise's "data scrub" in "Minority Report". But more importantly, watch how the images in Spielberg's "data scrub" sequences are two dimensional, and watch how the sequences in "Blade Runner" and "Johnny Mneumonic" all stress three dimensional space. 6/10  The "virtual reality sequences" in this film were outsourced to another production team, which is why they are the only things, for historical purposes, worth watching here. They're pretty cool sequences, Keanu Reeves literally tearing through a futuristic version of the internet with dancing hands and electronic gloves. One scene can be watched on youtube by typing "Johnny Mnemonic Future Internet" in the search bar. Before modems and personal computers were commonplace, this is how artists perceived our cyber-future. Worth one viewing.

    "Johnny Mnemonic" for many people considered as the harbinger of "The Matrix", but in any case we must not compare these two films. "Johnny Mnemonic" is a really different film from "The Matrix" with a lower budget and a lower improvement from the side of technology. It's a nice movie with a good performance by Keanu Reeves as Johnny Mnemonic and wonderful Dina Meyer as Jane. Ice-T as J-Bone and Takeshi Kitano as Takahashi made a good performances too. The story of this movie regards a man who use his mind as a hard drive and his self as a data courier to deliver packages from one man to another. One package is too big to deliver it but he gets this risk, so he want to deliver it as fast as he can not die from it.

    Dreary SF clunker with a typically uncharismatic Keanu Reeves as the title character, a courier who delivers data by carrying it around in an implant in his head, an upgrade that necessitated dumping portions of his long-term memory (including his acting classes, apparently). An intriguing premise is duly farted away thanks to a stillborn screenplay, flat direction, poor performances and gloomy music; what might have been an exciting thriller along the lines of 'Total Recall' has crawled onto the screen as a muddled, disappointing misfire. There are a couple of rewards along the way, such as the internet sequences, people getting sliced in half back when the visual was a fresh idea, and Dina Meyer, who I fancied like mad at the time.

    I've got a bit of a problem writing this review because immediately after seeing JOHNNY MNEMONIC I can hardly recall a thing about it . If I remember correctly it involves Keanu Reeves playing Keanu Reeves getting something downloaded in to his head and going somewhere to download it in to something and constantly bumping in to foul mouthed non actors every ten minutes . Have I got that right ? The screenplay is written by William Gibson , the purveyor of a science fiction of sub-genre called Cyberpunk which was very popular in the late 1989s and early 1990s but didn't translate at all well in to cinema . Without doubt the most successful Cyberpunk movie was the original version of THE MATRIX and as the sequels even the success of that film was probably down to a case of style over substance . The problem with JM is that too is trying to be style over substance and there's very little style to it It's a film trying to emulate the look of BLADERUNNER but director Robert Longo is no Ridley Scott . He also doesn't do his cause any good by casting Henry Rollins and Ice-T who give the impression they think they were going to be appearing in a cool hip movie only to find they weren't and reacted by giving disinterested performances . The worst aspect is the cinematography were everything is so dimly lit that it's impossible to see what is going on in the background or indeed if there is anything going on the background . Add to this a storyline that is often confusing then you've got a film that fails to hold the interest and is difficult to remember moments after seeing it

    Johnny (Keanu Reeves) lives in 2021. In this world, there is such an overload of technology and instant information from the Internet, that no one's secrets are safe online. For this reason, some men, like Johnny, have had part of their brains removed so that these anatomical parts can hold microchip data. Thus, they are modern couriers who deliver important documents to and fro. Also, the disparity between rich and poor is very prominent, with lots of street people and a few big wigs. Johnny is lucky to be sort of in the middle. One day, Johnny's head is loaded with information from a Japanese firm but there is trouble straight away. First, as Johnny goes to the bathroom, the men who gave him the data are assassinated. Our John barely gets away. Needing the help of some street folks like Jane (Dina Meyer), Spider (Henry Rollins) and J-Bone (Ice-T), the courier learns his brain is way overloaded and he will die if he can't find someone to accept the data. Naturally, the information is ultra-important for the world's health. His boss (Udo Kier) is a double-crosser, so he's no help. Also, a demonic street preacher (Dolph Lundgren) is put on his trail and told to eliminate Johnny. Who will be the last man standing? This story is really intriguing and science fiction fans would love to embrace it wholeheartedly. Unfortunately, the violence is over the top and damages the final product. Reeves does a fine job and looks great while the others do nice work, too, so the viewer does want to keep watching for their sakes. Also of tremendous quality are the special effects and art direction. If you like sci-fi, you might want to give this one a whirl but stay away if blood-and-gore is not your cup of tea.

    Usually when you watch a sci-fi film, the first half usually piques your interest only to sink into a confusing and badly written second half ("Star Trek V" comes to mind.). "Johnny Mnemonic" has the unique distinction of having a rather bad first half being saved by the second half. There were moments of badly delivered lines and situations, which I fully blame the director for. There were cuts where the demeanor of Keanu Reeves changed confusingly. Again I blame the director and continuity supervisor. There was, IMHO, more gore than necessary. But that's a matter of taste. And, to make matters worse, I wasn't sure of what I was watching. There was a LOT of good things about the movie. It told a sci-fi story about a dark and bleak future....somewhat similar to "Blade Runner". And it did it well. There were an amazing amount of sets, extras, and really well done computer effects. There was even one really well filmed shot in a hospital that reminded me of the long scene from "Gone With The Wind" showing the dead and dying in the Atlanta train yard. Many of the secondary actors (especially Henry Rollins as "Spider" and Ice-T as "J-Bone") were surprisingly good and helped to raise my rating of the film from an initial 4.0 to an overall 7.0 rating. If you aren't into a lot of foul language and/or gore, I'd steer clear of this film. But if you want to see a surprisingly well made piece of dark sci-fi, this is a film worth giving a chance to watch.

    I agree with Leonard Maltin's assessment of this movie-it's an intriguing idea that really doesn't get anywhere. The year is 2021, the internet has everyone trapped, and people are suffering from a disease called NAS. Keanu Reeves's character has a chip implanted in his brain that carries the cure, and the bad guys are after both him and it, trying to hunt them down, and a mysterious lady and some other characters are helping him. The movie was OK. Not bad, not great-just OK. My favorite scene was in the junkyard when the helicopter bad guys tried to bomb him, and Reeves gave a speech with some great lines. The special effects were great and were the film's real highlight, but other than that the film didn't have too much to recommend unless you're a scifi and action fan. ** out of ****

    Look, there is no arguing that this movie is dated and is rapidly becoming moreso. However, that does not change the fact that this cyberpunk gem stands firmly between Craig Baldwin's underground Spectres of the Spectrum and the Wachowski's mainstream hit The Matrix as a camp rebellion of digital overload in fetish costuming and grungy spectacle. Gibson provides the meat, Longo provides the gusto. From there, it's only a matter of wishing the acting was better and the graphics more advanced. However, digital effects had to develop somewhere between The Crow and Avatar. Hell, there's still an audience for this: why do you think cult filmgoers are turning out in droves for Repo: the Genetic Opera, arguably the musical version of this? Keanu Reeves plays an unknown prelude to his Neo role via postlude to his Bill and Ted role. To me, this works. For others, I can see what their problem is. But even beyond that, you still have Takeshi Kitano and Henry Rollins to contend with, and they take to their roles without any hesitation, and the result is good. You also have the, in my mind always appealing, assets in radiowave revolutionaries who fight the corporate machine in dirty reverse-engineered hacker lairs while still finding time to put on fantastic make-up and pleather over mesh clothing, Yakuza gangsters with katanas, guns, and lazer-strengthened piano wire, and tripped out mercenaries looking for a client while desperately staving off a tweaked-out race against time. Oh, and hacker dolphins. YEAH YOU HEARD ME. Hacker dolphins. So hate this movie if you want but this is the roots of all cyberpunk entertainment to me. --PolarisDiB

    I saw it shortly after it was released and I really liked it. At the time I had read several cyberpunk novels including some by William Gibson and to me. the movie seemed to capture the atmosphere of some of the novels very well. I found young Keanu Reeves highly credible as a surgically enhanced human (he'd be credible as a projection of artificial life...). I enjoyed the movie a lot and to this day I think it is a great adaptation of a cyberpunk novel to cinema. I did not give it a 10 because at times it seems too slavishly following the book and some reinterpretations for cinema might have benefited the movie. I have watched it maybe every 5 years since it was released and liked it a lot every time.

    In the year 2021, "Keanu Reeves is a space-age courier who's plugged in, turned on, and buffed up to deliver the most important data of the 21st century, wet-wired directly into his brain," according to the DVD sleeve's description. What Mr. Reeves doesn't know is that his latest download may be connected to the cure for the computer era's most deadly disease, a malady called Nerve Attenuation Syndrome (NAS). Everyone in the future seems to be at risk for NAS - something like this will probably happen in real life. Even Reeves' bodyguard, sexy Dina Meyer (as Jane), is afflicted. Needless to say, our hero and Ms. Meyer find themselves in mortal danger. Nasty Takeshi Kitano (as Takahashi) is willing to chop off Reeves' eyebrow-plucked head to get the valuable data loaded in the handsome courier's brain, but he'll have to beat dangerous street preacher Dolph Lundgren (as Karl) to the punch. Rapper Ice-T (as J-Bone) and rocker Henry Rollins (as Spider) join Meyer in trying to keep Reeves' from losing his head. Director Robert Longo brings writer William Gibson's story to the screen with some arresting visuals; but, their "Johnny Mnemonic" is disappointing. The bigger names in the cast seem unfocused, with only Mr. Lundgren and some of the minor characters providing focused characterizations. ***** Johnny Mnemonic (4/15/95) Robert Longo ~ Keanu Reeves, Dina Meyer, Ice-T, Dolph Lundgren

    Before "The Matrix" trilogy, Keanu Reeves starred in this cyberpunk film about a "data carrier" who gets entangled in a half baked tale of techno-espionage. The film was based on a great short story by legendary author William Gibson (who coined the term cyberspace), but the film itself doesn't have the budget or talent necessary to make Gibson's dystopian future come to life. Today the film is notable for several "virtual reality" sequences in which Keanu Reeves uses "cybernetic gloves" to navigate a futuristic version of "the internet". Sequences like this were found in many similar films at the time. For example, "Hackers", "Lawnmower Man", "Sneakers", "Tron", "Blade Runner" etc, all have scenes in which heroes use "interfaces" to "enter an image" or "program" and "find information". This was a big deal back in the days, but today you can find similar interactive sequences in everything from "Virtuosity" to "Minority Report". Interestingly, the best of these scenes is still "Blade Runner", with its rather low tech approach. In Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner", Harrison Ford uses a computer to slowly navigate his way through a simple celluloid photograph. Compare this to the wild arm movements, jazzy special effects, needless classical music and loud camera work of Tom Cruise's "data scrub" in "Minority Report". But more importantly, watch how the images in Spielberg's "data scrub" sequences are two dimensional, and watch how the sequences in "Blade Runner" and "Johnny Mneumonic" all stress three dimensional space. 6/10  The "virtual reality sequences" in this film were outsourced to another production team, which is why they are the only things, for historical purposes, worth watching here. They're pretty cool sequences, Keanu Reeves literally tearing through a futuristic version of the internet with dancing hands and electronic gloves. One scene can be watched on youtube by typing "Johnny Mnemonic Future Internet" in the search bar. Before modems and personal computers were commonplace, this is how artists perceived our cyber-future. Worth one viewing.

    "Johnny Mnemonic" for many people considered as the harbinger of "The Matrix", but in any case we must not compare these two films. "Johnny Mnemonic" is a really different film from "The Matrix" with a lower budget and a lower improvement from the side of technology. It's a nice movie with a good performance by Keanu Reeves as Johnny Mnemonic and wonderful Dina Meyer as Jane. Ice-T as J-Bone and Takeshi Kitano as Takahashi made a good performances too. The story of this movie regards a man who use his mind as a hard drive and his self as a data courier to deliver packages from one man to another. One package is too big to deliver it but he gets this risk, so he want to deliver it as fast as he can not die from it.

    Dreary SF clunker with a typically uncharismatic Keanu Reeves as the title character, a courier who delivers data by carrying it around in an implant in his head, an upgrade that necessitated dumping portions of his long-term memory (including his acting classes, apparently). An intriguing premise is duly farted away thanks to a stillborn screenplay, flat direction, poor performances and gloomy music; what might have been an exciting thriller along the lines of 'Total Recall' has crawled onto the screen as a muddled, disappointing misfire. There are a couple of rewards along the way, such as the internet sequences, people getting sliced in half back when the visual was a fresh idea, and Dina Meyer, who I fancied like mad at the time.

    I've got a bit of a problem writing this review because immediately after seeing JOHNNY MNEMONIC I can hardly recall a thing about it . If I remember correctly it involves Keanu Reeves playing Keanu Reeves getting something downloaded in to his head and going somewhere to download it in to something and constantly bumping in to foul mouthed non actors every ten minutes . Have I got that right ? The screenplay is written by William Gibson , the purveyor of a science fiction of sub-genre called Cyberpunk which was very popular in the late 1989s and early 1990s but didn't translate at all well in to cinema . Without doubt the most successful Cyberpunk movie was the original version of THE MATRIX and as the sequels even the success of that film was probably down to a case of style over substance . The problem with JM is that too is trying to be style over substance and there's very little style to it It's a film trying to emulate the look of BLADERUNNER but director Robert Longo is no Ridley Scott . He also doesn't do his cause any good by casting Henry Rollins and Ice-T who give the impression they think they were going to be appearing in a cool hip movie only to find they weren't and reacted by giving disinterested performances . The worst aspect is the cinematography were everything is so dimly lit that it's impossible to see what is going on in the background or indeed if there is anything going on the background . Add to this a storyline that is often confusing then you've got a film that fails to hold the interest and is difficult to remember moments after seeing it

    Johnny (Keanu Reeves) lives in 2021. In this world, there is such an overload of technology and instant information from the Internet, that no one's secrets are safe online. For this reason, some men, like Johnny, have had part of their brains removed so that these anatomical parts can hold microchip data. Thus, they are modern couriers who deliver important documents to and fro. Also, the disparity between rich and poor is very prominent, with lots of street people and a few big wigs. Johnny is lucky to be sort of in the middle. One day, Johnny's head is loaded with information from a Japanese firm but there is trouble straight away. First, as Johnny goes to the bathroom, the men who gave him the data are assassinated. Our John barely gets away. Needing the help of some street folks like Jane (Dina Meyer), Spider (Henry Rollins) and J-Bone (Ice-T), the courier learns his brain is way overloaded and he will die if he can't find someone to accept the data. Naturally, the information is ultra-important for the world's health. His boss (Udo Kier) is a double-crosser, so he's no help. Also, a demonic street preacher (Dolph Lundgren) is put on his trail and told to eliminate Johnny. Who will be the last man standing? This story is really intriguing and science fiction fans would love to embrace it wholeheartedly. Unfortunately, the violence is over the top and damages the final product. Reeves does a fine job and looks great while the others do nice work, too, so the viewer does want to keep watching for their sakes. Also of tremendous quality are the special effects and art direction. If you like sci-fi, you might want to give this one a whirl but stay away if blood-and-gore is not your cup of tea.

    Usually when you watch a sci-fi film, the first half usually piques your interest only to sink into a confusing and badly written second half ("Star Trek V" comes to mind.). "Johnny Mnemonic" has the unique distinction of having a rather bad first half being saved by the second half. There were moments of badly delivered lines and situations, which I fully blame the director for. There were cuts where the demeanor of Keanu Reeves changed confusingly. Again I blame the director and continuity supervisor. There was, IMHO, more gore than necessary. But that's a matter of taste. And, to make matters worse, I wasn't sure of what I was watching. There was a LOT of good things about the movie. It told a sci-fi story about a dark and bleak future....somewhat similar to "Blade Runner". And it did it well. There were an amazing amount of sets, extras, and really well done computer effects. There was even one really well filmed shot in a hospital that reminded me of the long scene from "Gone With The Wind" showing the dead and dying in the Atlanta train yard. Many of the secondary actors (especially Henry Rollins as "Spider" and Ice-T as "J-Bone") were surprisingly good and helped to raise my rating of the film from an initial 4.0 to an overall 7.0 rating. If you aren't into a lot of foul language and/or gore, I'd steer clear of this film. But if you want to see a surprisingly well made piece of dark sci-fi, this is a film worth giving a chance to watch.

    I agree with Leonard Maltin's assessment of this movie-it's an intriguing idea that really doesn't get anywhere. The year is 2021, the internet has everyone trapped, and people are suffering from a disease called NAS. Keanu Reeves's character has a chip implanted in his brain that carries the cure, and the bad guys are after both him and it, trying to hunt them down, and a mysterious lady and some other characters are helping him. The movie was OK. Not bad, not great-just OK. My favorite scene was in the junkyard when the helicopter bad guys tried to bomb him, and Reeves gave a speech with some great lines. The special effects were great and were the film's real highlight, but other than that the film didn't have too much to recommend unless you're a scifi and action fan. ** out of ****

    Look, there is no arguing that this movie is dated and is rapidly becoming moreso. However, that does not change the fact that this cyberpunk gem stands firmly between Craig Baldwin's underground Spectres of the Spectrum and the Wachowski's mainstream hit The Matrix as a camp rebellion of digital overload in fetish costuming and grungy spectacle. Gibson provides the meat, Longo provides the gusto. From there, it's only a matter of wishing the acting was better and the graphics more advanced. However, digital effects had to develop somewhere between The Crow and Avatar. Hell, there's still an audience for this: why do you think cult filmgoers are turning out in droves for Repo: the Genetic Opera, arguably the musical version of this? Keanu Reeves plays an unknown prelude to his Neo role via postlude to his Bill and Ted role. To me, this works. For others, I can see what their problem is. But even beyond that, you still have Takeshi Kitano and Henry Rollins to contend with, and they take to their roles without any hesitation, and the result is good. You also have the, in my mind always appealing, assets in radiowave revolutionaries who fight the corporate machine in dirty reverse-engineered hacker lairs while still finding time to put on fantastic make-up and pleather over mesh clothing, Yakuza gangsters with katanas, guns, and lazer-strengthened piano wire, and tripped out mercenaries looking for a client while desperately staving off a tweaked-out race against time. Oh, and hacker dolphins. YEAH YOU HEARD ME. Hacker dolphins. So hate this movie if you want but this is the roots of all cyberpunk entertainment to me. --PolarisDiB

    I saw it shortly after it was released and I really liked it. At the time I had read several cyberpunk novels including some by William Gibson and to me. the movie seemed to capture the atmosphere of some of the novels very well. I found young Keanu Reeves highly credible as a surgically enhanced human (he'd be credible as a projection of artificial life...). I enjoyed the movie a lot and to this day I think it is a great adaptation of a cyberpunk novel to cinema. I did not give it a 10 because at times it seems too slavishly following the book and some reinterpretations for cinema might have benefited the movie. I have watched it maybe every 5 years since it was released and liked it a lot every time.

    In the year 2021, "Keanu Reeves is a space-age courier who's plugged in, turned on, and buffed up to deliver the most important data of the 21st century, wet-wired directly into his brain," according to the DVD sleeve's description. What Mr. Reeves doesn't know is that his latest download may be connected to the cure for the computer era's most deadly disease, a malady called Nerve Attenuation Syndrome (NAS). Everyone in the future seems to be at risk for NAS - something like this will probably happen in real life. Even Reeves' bodyguard, sexy Dina Meyer (as Jane), is afflicted. Needless to say, our hero and Ms. Meyer find themselves in mortal danger. Nasty Takeshi Kitano (as Takahashi) is willing to chop off Reeves' eyebrow-plucked head to get the valuable data loaded in the handsome courier's brain, but he'll have to beat dangerous street preacher Dolph Lundgren (as Karl) to the punch. Rapper Ice-T (as J-Bone) and rocker Henry Rollins (as Spider) join Meyer in trying to keep Reeves' from losing his head. Director Robert Longo brings writer William Gibson's story to the screen with some arresting visuals; but, their "Johnny Mnemonic" is disappointing. The bigger names in the cast seem unfocused, with only Mr. Lundgren and some of the minor characters providing focused characterizations. ***** Johnny Mnemonic (4/15/95) Robert Longo ~ Keanu Reeves, Dina Meyer, Ice-T, Dolph Lundgren

    Before "The Matrix" trilogy, Keanu Reeves starred in this cyberpunk film about a "data carrier" who gets entangled in a half baked tale of techno-espionage. The film was based on a great short story by legendary author William Gibson (who coined the term cyberspace), but the film itself doesn't have the budget or talent necessary to make Gibson's dystopian future come to life. Today the film is notable for several "virtual reality" sequences in which Keanu Reeves uses "cybernetic gloves" to navigate a futuristic version of "the internet". Sequences like this were found in many similar films at the time. For example, "Hackers", "Lawnmower Man", "Sneakers", "Tron", "Blade Runner" etc, all have scenes in which heroes use "interfaces" to "enter an image" or "program" and "find information". This was a big deal back in the days, but today you can find similar interactive sequences in everything from "Virtuosity" to "Minority Report". Interestingly, the best of these scenes is still "Blade Runner", with its rather low tech approach. In Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner", Harrison Ford uses a computer to slowly navigate his way through a simple celluloid photograph. Compare this to the wild arm movements, jazzy special effects, needless classical music and loud camera work of Tom Cruise's "data scrub" in "Minority Report". But more importantly, watch how the images in Spielberg's "data scrub" sequences are two dimensional, and watch how the sequences in "Blade Runner" and "Johnny Mneumonic" all stress three dimensional space. 6/10  The "virtual reality sequences" in this film were outsourced to another production team, which is why they are the only things, for historical purposes, worth watching here. They're pretty cool sequences, Keanu Reeves literally tearing through a futuristic version of the internet with dancing hands and electronic gloves. One scene can be watched on youtube by typing "Johnny Mnemonic Future Internet" in the search bar. Before modems and personal computers were commonplace, this is how artists perceived our cyber-future. Worth one viewing.
