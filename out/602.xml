    Jerry Mulligan (Gene Kelly) is a struggling American painter who quit his job in the army to pursue his passion in the sizzling Paris. His good friend includes Adam Cook (Oscar Levant) an unknown pianist who lives in an apartment nearby. Adam introduces Jerry to Henri Baurel (Georges Guetary) a popular local crooner, who is to marry a 'vivacious, modern, enchanting, fascinating, exciting, sweet, shy and scholarly' dancer Lise ( Jerry does not know about this, however). Jerry puts his landscape paintings on display along the brick walls in the streets of Paris, and makes a paltry living out of it. His character is somewhat nasty, but many struggling street artists whom I have met are actually nasty with their take-it-or-leave attitude. He meets Milo (Nina Foch) a middle-aged rich woman who takes fancy to his paintings and agrees to buy two of his works. However, it can be observed here how Milo is actually trying to woo Jerry, as she tells Jerry that she does not have enough money and invites him to her hotel room. Madonna of the 50s, I say! Jerry does not respond well to her advances and starts flirting unabashedly with a young girl at the pub aka Lise. Jerry gets her number and almost prowls her to fall in love with him, which she eventually does. Conversely, Lise sets out more traps for Jerry. The rest is well. obvious. The Oscar and Golden Globes Associations have infamously awarded lesser deserving films, actors, actresses, supporting actors, supporting actresses, documentaries, music, screenplay. For example, Sandra Bullock's tough white compassionate mother act that paled even in comparison to a similar tough mom act by Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich. Or take the complete failure of recognition of 1952s 'Singin' in The Rain', a definitive musical masterpiece also starring Gene Kelly, and my personal choice for the greatest film of the 20th century. But to see 'An American in Paris' win Best Picture and Best Screenplay (!!!) is an unexpected and somewhat sour surprise. Why? Because An American in Paris is an incomplete film, lacking a thorough script, thin of memorable songs and dance sequences, short of convincing performances and devoid of a proper conclusion. How can this be rewarded the best script when the last twenty minutes did not receive enough momentum from the first ninety minutes, thus making the entire attempt somewhat flat? Gene Kelly's larger-than-life, showy persona proved an advantage in 'SITR' but here, where he has to downplay his character, it militates his likability. Also, his treatment of Jean Hagen's Lena Lamont in SITR was correct because of Lena's demanding diva personality. But to behave in the same way with Milo in AAIP made him a bit of a cad, especially when he drops her like a brick in the end without even considering her feelings for once, that too when he was acting in the same fashion albeit to woo Lise. He also has this slightly putting off habit of acting and moving in an affected way that is paradoxical to his role. Watch the first scene where he gets up fully aware that there is a camera in front of him, and then performs various movements in a rehearsed fashion. Works well at times, especially during the sing and dance numbers but lacks trueness otherwise. Hard to blame him though, since many actors 'act' this way. Leslie Caron does not live up to all the qualities mentioned about her by Henri. She seems shy, somewhat traditional and even reticent, like Talia Shire's character in Rocky. It is only when she dances that there comes some personality in her. But she still does not have the desired screen presence during the numbers, and cannot stand out when performing in a group. Also her chemistry with Gene is often bland and one-sided; Gene at least manages to show some fondness towards her while Leslie looks as if she is just playing along with him. Henri can sing well and act charmingly, but his character too is poorly given the chauffeur/dad-who-opposes-then-concedes treatment. They could have had some dialog between Henri and Lise, since love can't be so easily given up. And don't get me started on the ridiculous superhero-like costumes both Gene and Henri were wearing in the otherwise serious scene before the final performance! Oscar Levant was utterly wasted; he had a promising back-story or whatever you call it. They could have especially done more after his daydreaming concert act to draw attention upon his unfulfilled desires of becoming famous before the party scene. Oscar Levant, like many other actors, just parrots his lines without adding any gravity to it. Nina Foch was the only actor truly worth mentioning here; she conveys her dry charm, furtiveness and ultimately disappointment well. All of the songs are melodious but not catchy. However, they have the French charm that gives fervor to the movie. Even 'My Fair Lady' had fabulous numbers but I cannot remember any; it is because unlike Singing in the Rain or Marry Poppins or Sound of Music, they don't carry indelible hooks. So it isn't a fault, just a lacking. But the fault was to place all these numbers in this film; they failed to add up and boost the finale. Conversely, SITR placed its numbers so well that the 12 minute Broadway Melody spectacle at the end was just dazzling. I have to commend the unique filming techniques in the film: Lise could not be described more wonderfully, the one-man band was clever and the theatrical finishing was ingenious. The performances, especially the one between Kelly and Guetary brought a smile to my face. But the movie itself disappointed me; it seems like a beta version when compared to Singing in the Rain, but as a standalone, it was underwhelming. My Rating: 5.5 out of 10

    Take an accomplished director, one of the world's most famous dancers, a dreamily romantic setting and music from none other than George Gershwin and what do you have? In the case of An American in Paris, you have a film which, for me, falls flat on its face. The winning combination of talent and reputation thrilled the critics, back in 1951 and the film was showered with awards including six Oscars. But, looked at coldly and in retrospect, it's difficult to understand why . Right from the opening scene, when Gene Kelly  who is supposed to be starving in a Paris garret  wakes up looking prosperous, over-confident and heavily made-up, you can already hear the turkey feathers starting to rustle. The story falters and bumbles its way through yawning intervals which separate the big numbers and the characters become less convincing with every scene. Leslie Caron, when she finally turns up, looks terrified and toothy and though she dances superbly, seems too timid to bring magic to any of her scenes. She and Kelly dance pretty well together, technically, but without the slightest sense of partnership. Watching them, I got the impression that each would rather have been somewhere else. The music, despite such great numbers, seems to have been shoe-horned into the narrative and often, doesn't fit. The scene where Gershwin's rattlingly wonderful Concerto in F is performed, for instance, has nothing to do with anything else in the film. It does, however, provide moments of sweet relief from the limping story and embarrassingly stilted scenes. It's hard to believe that Oklahoma was released only four years later, in 1955 and yet, seems to belong to a different era. Oklahoma succeeds in every respect where An American in Paris fails. The acting is convincing, the story works well, the casting is faultless, the choreography - apart from the disappointing dream sequence - is sublime. But above all, the characters in Oklahoma perform with zest and sparkle in overdrive. That makes the film overflow with a sense of freshness, excitement and overflowing 'joy de vivre'. What a difference!

    After service in World War II, singer-dancer and struggling painter Gene Kelly (as Jerry Mulligan) settles on the Left Bank of Paris. His handsome features attract heiress Nina Foch (as Milo Roberts) and Mr. Kelly quickly becomes her escort. While out nightclubbing with his sponsor, Kelly sets he his sights on pretty young Leslie Caron (as Lise Bouvier). However, she is seeing local entertainer Georges Guetary (as Henri Baurel). Another American in Paris, pianist Oscar Levant (as Adam Cook), connects the lovers. Outstanding singing, dancing, impressions and setting in a too long and flimsy story; the art remains. ******** An American in Paris (8/26/51) Vincente Minnelli ~ Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant, Georges Guetary

    Fans of the movie genres known as "Musical", "Classic", and "Romance" and pure true lovers, lend me your ear. If you looking for the perfect romance musical, then the Oscar-winning "An American in Paris" is really the right movie for you. From the first minute, you, fellow viewer and reader, has been transformed into a cinematic world of lavishing color, enchanting magic and endless delights. After the end, even the whole movie stays with you for long as you can remember. This is the story of Jerry Mulligan {Gene Kelly}, a former American GI living in Paris making paintings and making friends with pianist Adam Cook {Oscar Levant} and singer Henri Baurel {Georges Guetary}. He soon finds love in the form of Lise Bouvier {Leslie Caron}, but soon romantic problems develop and Lise is not sure of what to do with her future with Jerry. This is one of the most delicious and most shining musicals around, and the superb score and choreography shows why this film feels not really dated. George and Ira Gershwin has mastered a genius of a lovely score right here, filled with so much many hummable songs such as "I Got Rhythm", "Our Love is Here to Stay", "Stairway to Paradise" and so much more. This is really and truly better than most of the music we have today. The choreography by Kelly is and truly a revelation. The most memorable of these, the ballet in the end, is one of the most ingenious and wondrous musical numbers we have ever seen in the history of the American musical. Kelly gives an everyday guy persona to Jerry. Once he becomes a character, we stay with him that way. The way he acts, the way he really dances, the way he sings, he really is a different type of a character. Caron really delivers in her first film role as Lise. She gives a lighting spark of radiance and power to the character. The moments that Kelly and Caron are together, the heart of romance goes aflutter and the viewer suddenly has gone love struck, rooting for them all the way. Even the supporting cast is feeling the magic as we speak. Levant is very funny and sensational. He delivers the film's comic moment when he conducts his own orchestra performing his own piece in a hilarious dream. Guetary is all dapper and gay. He is truly a wonder performing "Stairway to Paradise". Nina Foch also delivers as Jerry's society friend, Milo. She delivers one of the film's best one liners when waiting for a date with Jerry and another girl, Jerry asks "Who is the other girl?" Milo says "Me." Vincente Minnelli delivers a fantastic film here. Alan Jay Lerner's script is nothing short of delightful. The costumes and the sets by Orry-Kelly, Preston Kelly and Cedric Gibbons, respectively, are full of splendor and life. This is really a magnificent and can't miss film to watch not just by yourself, but for the whole entire family, even your pet. Rarely has a musical felt so much lovely and perfectly as this. My Pick: Green Light {See It}

    The story is surprisingly intense and actually eclipses the dancing sequences which are impressive. As much as the movies's plot may seem hokey and contrived, it really isn't. The story is plausible; people can fall in love immediately and get swept up in their emotions. Gene Kelly gives a great performance as an expatriate American and Leslie Caron proves to be dynamic in her role. The final dance sequence is incredible, combining several different dance forms. What makes this movie even stronger is that the story is simple, the characters likable and the music outstanding. The dream sequence with Oscar Levant was brilliant. There is nothing wrong with an upbeat movie featuring wonderfully talented actors who actually entertain. They sing, they dance, there is music and a happy ending. What's wrong with that? Nothing. This movie deserved the honors it received. Street Car and A Place in the Sun were marvelous movies, but a quality musical will trump a bleak, black-and-white drama anytime, like it did in 1951. Who would an audience rather watch: Gene Kelly laughing and dancing with Leslie Caron to the music of George Gershwin or gloomy Montgomery Clift plotting to kill a hapless Shelly Winters?

    I'e been a huge fan of "Singin' in the Rain" for quite some time now. I loved the songs, costumes, story, and actors in that one. I had heard of AAIP for a while, too. I've heard it was spectacular and decided to give it a whirl. It's not the worst I've ever seen, oh no. But definitely one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. First of all, Gene Kelly wasn't my favorite in SITR (I prefer Donald O'Connor). But I still thought he was alright. But he wasn't nearly as good in AAIP. His singing is okay here and there. But he doesn't do anything that makes me stare with wide eyes. I've always thought he was overrated. Not bad. But definitely overrated. And I didn't like his character much in this one, either. Also, his chemistry with Leslie Caron is not very believable, in my opinion. Speaking of Leslie, this was her first film. So I understand how she might be uncomfortable. But, am I the only one who doesn't think she's that pretty in this one? I thought she was fabulous in "Gigi" (1958). She was gorgeous and very talented in that one. But this one, she was missing something. But it was fun to watch her dance on pointe. Kelly's pal, Oscar Levant, is supposed to be the comic relief. Well, he wasn't at all comical, or at all a relief, for that matter. I loved his piano playing and I hope to be as good as him someday. But he was about as humorous as a brick and not a good actor, either. If you want a real good Gene Kelly pal, watch Donald O'Connor in SITR. He's actually funny and talented in many ways. So, I only gave this a 5 because of Levant's piano playing (which was magnificent), Kelly's "I Got Rhythmn" number with the little kids (but I do still prefer Judy Garland's version of the song), and the ballet at the end. As much as I love SITR, it's ballet was not as exciting. I did like the ballet in AAIP very much. So, all in all, it's a so-so movie. If you like that sort of thing, go ahead and watch it. But I'm warning you. You'd be much better off with watching "Singin' in the Rain".

    Movie musicals aren't my strong suit, but most of the time when I see one it manages to be entertaining enough. Gene Kelly has a way of making all of his dance moves seem effortlessly easy, and watching Leslie Caron keep in step with him is one of the highlights of the film. I wasn't too crazy about the romantic entanglements in the story, as Jerry Mulligan (Kelly) seemed better suited to end up with his sponsor Milo Roberts (Nina Foch); while Caron's character didn't seem to be a match for either Jerry or her fianc&eacute;e. I never could quite understand how a jilted lover, in this case Henri (Georges Guetary), manages to be so gallant in the end when his girlfriend goes off with another man. The main attraction here is the song and dance. Kelly is fun to watch in every one of his numbers, and the sequence featuring his pianist buddy Adam (Oscar Levant) was fairly innovative and entertaining. I got a kick out of the way Levant reacted to Henri's counsel for Jerry in matters of love and romance. Even though the picture relied heavily on extravagant use of color, it was interesting to see the gala black and white Mardi Gras style party in costumed splendor. As befitting the title of the picture, a couple more of the lavish dance sequences relied heavily on red, white and blue, an appropriate statement considering Kelly's character an ex-GI. This film made AFI's original Top 100 Movies of all time in 1997, but dropped off a decade later when the listing was revised in 2007. Considering it's competition for the Best Picture Oscar in 1952, namely "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun", it's curious to me how this one would have taken top honors, but I've stopped fretting about these things a long time ago. For my money, I'll take Kelly's follow up a year later, "Singin' in the Rain", but if you're a fan of movie musicals, there's enough entertainment value in both to keep one satisfied.

    Jerry Mulligan is a struggling American artist in Paris, he gets coveted by a rich heiress who can help his struggling career. However, a visit to a night club and a meeting with a delicate young, but spoken for, French girl, leads him into a battle with himself. Winner of seven Academy Awards, An American In Paris is of course a delightful and breezy picture from the MGM vault. Said to be the personal favourite movie of Gene Kelly, it boasts wonderful tunes from George & Ira Gershwin, brilliant art direction from Cedric Gibbons, vivid Technicolor that fills the eyes, and quite stunning choreography from Gene Kelly. The film, all told, is high on production value and entertaining enough from start to finish. Yet the film's plot is showing definite age problems now, and it also lacks the ode to joy sense of purpose that, for example, Singing In The Rain has. I also feel it's a missed opportunity to actually film the picture entirely on location in Paris instead of on the MGM lot, because a bit of earthy core feels missing from the unfolding story. Leslie Caron as the love rival to the smokingly hot older woman played by Nina Foch, is majestic dance wise, but acting she's very staid, and this too is an irritation. However, I still adore this film very much, just not as much as Gene and the Academy did, apparently! Come the grand finale it's hard to be too critical when so much energy and deftness of feet has been constructed for our entertainment. With such a production it's suffice to say that now, with all the technological advances made in home entertainment, An American in Paris is an High Definition essential. 7/10

    This is a film, I've found, about which nobody can ever be persuaded. It's too much an example of its various genres (musical, dance-fest, inevitable romance, exotic setting) to ever transcend them. That locks one's reaction to this undeniable classic of the studio system  "Made in Hollywood, U.S.A.," indeed  into whether one likes those genres. If you love any or all of George (and Ira) Gershwin's work, intricate choreography, ballet taken to literally Impressionistic heights, Paris long-shots (yes, the second unit did go there, it wasn't all done in Culver City), and happy endings, you'll dote on this film. If you can't stand plots that mainly tie musical performances together, actors who are chosen for dance or singing talent more than thespian skills, or back-lot artifice (yes, the brilliant 17-minute ballet at the end is the ultimate example), you won't see it twice. That makes one smoothly written appraisal difficult. It's full of elements popping up from each genre. It's the studio system at its most and least successful. (Not "worst." Nothing with the Gershwins' work can EVER be a "worst.") So I'll jump in to defend several elements against some strong criticisms. Some of this depends on remembering the elephant on those "Parisian" streets: There'd been a war on. ~ Gene Kelly (Jerry Mulligan): He's frequently derided as too old, either in absolute terms or relative to the rest of the cast. Not at all! Exuberant skill undercuts his physical age by at least 15 years here. It also makes Jerry's pursuit of Lise far more plausible. I'm sorry, but it's just not "stalking," then or now. It's elegantly converted from machismo, the kind that many women have complained about when seeing it ... and even more when they don't see it. Nor is Kelly so overambitious as to fit uncomfortably in a penniless-painter role, as some have said. It's too easy to forget that Jerry's been in Paris since the Second World War ended. That tore spirits or bodies apart for nearly all the Americans who fought in it, sooner or later, partly from most being forced into a crusader role they didn't want. This G.I. could need a few years to reawaken his capacity for talented work and fervent love. ~ Leslie Caron (Lise): She didn't show earnest or assertive acting until "Gigi," true enough. She was a brilliant dancing partner for Kelly, and not much more. (Those eyes and that smile, though, were to die for even at that age.) Yet consider Lise's back story, such as it is  losing her parents, Resistance fighters, before adolescence, and growing up with mentors instead. Wouldn't that have made her less confident about what the world would bring to her? She, as well as Mulligan, blossoms slowly after a dry spell. ~ Georges Gu&eacute;tary (Henri): He's the grounded contrast to Jerry's shallower-rooted American. His confidence and resilience aren't at all overblown. He's had a performing career and he's sticking to making the most of it, which will include Lise if it can, but will ultimately go on without her if it must. This boulevardier has a quiet persistence that isn't immediately evident. ~ Oscar Levant (Adam): No, he is not at all superfluous to the story, nor to the romantic entanglements. Just look at the scene in the caf&eacute; where he's sitting between Henri and Jerry, and only he knows that the others love the same girl. His frantic reactions, when the men unknowingly talk about the same object of affection, show priceless comic timing and subtly discharge any over-emotion. Levant was a brilliant pianist, and this friend of the composer had to have a Gershwin showcase. (The last movement of the "Concerto in F," where he's imagining himself also as orchestra, conductor, and audience.) Yet he's not a survivor, as Jerry and Lise are, and he's not above it all, as Henri is. He has unfulfilled ambition and imagination, yet stays involved enough in life to appreciate enthusiasm and stay connected to friends. His deflation of Jerry's sponsor at the end is not just a bon mot, but an act of loyalty. ~ Nina Foch (Milo): Okay, she's a bit too young and beautiful to be entirely convincing as Jerry's older patron. Yet she has the most acting skills of any of the main characters, and she takes a thankless position in the story and makes it both dignified and funny. Her possessiveness about Jerry is understandable and is offset by considerable good humor and charm. She has ambitions, romantic and otherwise, but she's not insincere about them, as out-sized as they may be. Milo's rising interest and final withdrawal are both quietly skilled and acted out in a minimum of screen time. ~ The plot: Yes, it mainly ties the music together and compresses events to make room. Yes, at times it makes Jerry too persistent, Adam too acerbic, Milo too grasping, Lise too unquestioning, Henri too accepting. Yet it remains remarkable for making so many genres work together at all! Alan Jay Lerner knew it was just functional (Oscar notwithstanding). It was meant to turn an artistic salad, with Gershwin lettuce, into a tasty meal for the viewer, and it more than succeeded in doing so. ... So is this, even for a lover of the Gershwins' music, anywhere near perfect? It comes very close. The plot more than exceeds the burdens put upon it, but it still has little resonance, so I take away one star. Yet the actors rise to their situations and show their strengths beautifully. It really comes down to one truth, as a lyric says: "Our love is here to stay." Not necessarily for the studio confectionery, or the mannered acting, or the utility plot. But for the incomparable Gershwins, and for what could be so ably strung upon their brilliance.

    I watched this movie 59 years after it was released (God bless technology) and what struck me most was the difference in the culture. The love connection that drives the story is created when he literally stalks her until she laughingly concedes after which point, their love is assumed as a given. And for the "other guy" to deliver his cheating fianc&eacute;e to him at the end of the movie WITH A SMILE(!!??!!) is so far beyond ridiculous, I'm not even sure I saw it right. There were other instances but I think I've made my point. I don't think the story was intended to be the real draw here. At least I hope not. The music and dancing were so good (Gene Kelly has more charm and charisma in any single scene than most Hollywood studios can dream of cramming into their products these days), that despite the story line and the relationships portrayed being mind-boggling, the movie is fun and engaging. What motivated the characters to make some of the decisions they made is simply beyond me but I guess it was just a different time with different social norms and since the real selling points of the movie (the Gershwins music and Gene Kelly's screen presence) needed the plot to go a certain way in order to do their thing, it just did and all told, that's fine with me. If it wasn't for Gene Kelly and the Gershwins, this movie would have been a non-starter but with their immeasurable talent, it is a movie worth watching. Leslie Caron as a leading lady was an epic fail but I'm sure a lot of the blame for that lies in the story itself. It cannot be easy to play a lady who switches from angrily saying "You are downright annoying!" to giggling and agreeing to meet for a date a split second later because he refused to take no for an answer. But that's just my two scents. ;)

    Jerry Mulligan (Gene Kelly) is a struggling American painter who quit his job in the army to pursue his passion in the sizzling Paris. His good friend includes Adam Cook (Oscar Levant) an unknown pianist who lives in an apartment nearby. Adam introduces Jerry to Henri Baurel (Georges Guetary) a popular local crooner, who is to marry a 'vivacious, modern, enchanting, fascinating, exciting, sweet, shy and scholarly' dancer Lise ( Jerry does not know about this, however). Jerry puts his landscape paintings on display along the brick walls in the streets of Paris, and makes a paltry living out of it. His character is somewhat nasty, but many struggling street artists whom I have met are actually nasty with their take-it-or-leave attitude. He meets Milo (Nina Foch) a middle-aged rich woman who takes fancy to his paintings and agrees to buy two of his works. However, it can be observed here how Milo is actually trying to woo Jerry, as she tells Jerry that she does not have enough money and invites him to her hotel room. Madonna of the 50s, I say! Jerry does not respond well to her advances and starts flirting unabashedly with a young girl at the pub aka Lise. Jerry gets her number and almost prowls her to fall in love with him, which she eventually does. Conversely, Lise sets out more traps for Jerry. The rest is well. obvious. The Oscar and Golden Globes Associations have infamously awarded lesser deserving films, actors, actresses, supporting actors, supporting actresses, documentaries, music, screenplay. For example, Sandra Bullock's tough white compassionate mother act that paled even in comparison to a similar tough mom act by Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich. Or take the complete failure of recognition of 1952s 'Singin' in The Rain', a definitive musical masterpiece also starring Gene Kelly, and my personal choice for the greatest film of the 20th century. But to see 'An American in Paris' win Best Picture and Best Screenplay (!!!) is an unexpected and somewhat sour surprise. Why? Because An American in Paris is an incomplete film, lacking a thorough script, thin of memorable songs and dance sequences, short of convincing performances and devoid of a proper conclusion. How can this be rewarded the best script when the last twenty minutes did not receive enough momentum from the first ninety minutes, thus making the entire attempt somewhat flat? Gene Kelly's larger-than-life, showy persona proved an advantage in 'SITR' but here, where he has to downplay his character, it militates his likability. Also, his treatment of Jean Hagen's Lena Lamont in SITR was correct because of Lena's demanding diva personality. But to behave in the same way with Milo in AAIP made him a bit of a cad, especially when he drops her like a brick in the end without even considering her feelings for once, that too when he was acting in the same fashion albeit to woo Lise. He also has this slightly putting off habit of acting and moving in an affected way that is paradoxical to his role. Watch the first scene where he gets up fully aware that there is a camera in front of him, and then performs various movements in a rehearsed fashion. Works well at times, especially during the sing and dance numbers but lacks trueness otherwise. Hard to blame him though, since many actors 'act' this way. Leslie Caron does not live up to all the qualities mentioned about her by Henri. She seems shy, somewhat traditional and even reticent, like Talia Shire's character in Rocky. It is only when she dances that there comes some personality in her. But she still does not have the desired screen presence during the numbers, and cannot stand out when performing in a group. Also her chemistry with Gene is often bland and one-sided; Gene at least manages to show some fondness towards her while Leslie looks as if she is just playing along with him. Henri can sing well and act charmingly, but his character too is poorly given the chauffeur/dad-who-opposes-then-concedes treatment. They could have had some dialog between Henri and Lise, since love can't be so easily given up. And don't get me started on the ridiculous superhero-like costumes both Gene and Henri were wearing in the otherwise serious scene before the final performance! Oscar Levant was utterly wasted; he had a promising back-story or whatever you call it. They could have especially done more after his daydreaming concert act to draw attention upon his unfulfilled desires of becoming famous before the party scene. Oscar Levant, like many other actors, just parrots his lines without adding any gravity to it. Nina Foch was the only actor truly worth mentioning here; she conveys her dry charm, furtiveness and ultimately disappointment well. All of the songs are melodious but not catchy. However, they have the French charm that gives fervor to the movie. Even 'My Fair Lady' had fabulous numbers but I cannot remember any; it is because unlike Singing in the Rain or Marry Poppins or Sound of Music, they don't carry indelible hooks. So it isn't a fault, just a lacking. But the fault was to place all these numbers in this film; they failed to add up and boost the finale. Conversely, SITR placed its numbers so well that the 12 minute Broadway Melody spectacle at the end was just dazzling. I have to commend the unique filming techniques in the film: Lise could not be described more wonderfully, the one-man band was clever and the theatrical finishing was ingenious. The performances, especially the one between Kelly and Guetary brought a smile to my face. But the movie itself disappointed me; it seems like a beta version when compared to Singing in the Rain, but as a standalone, it was underwhelming. My Rating: 5.5 out of 10

    Take an accomplished director, one of the world's most famous dancers, a dreamily romantic setting and music from none other than George Gershwin and what do you have? In the case of An American in Paris, you have a film which, for me, falls flat on its face. The winning combination of talent and reputation thrilled the critics, back in 1951 and the film was showered with awards including six Oscars. But, looked at coldly and in retrospect, it's difficult to understand why . Right from the opening scene, when Gene Kelly  who is supposed to be starving in a Paris garret  wakes up looking prosperous, over-confident and heavily made-up, you can already hear the turkey feathers starting to rustle. The story falters and bumbles its way through yawning intervals which separate the big numbers and the characters become less convincing with every scene. Leslie Caron, when she finally turns up, looks terrified and toothy and though she dances superbly, seems too timid to bring magic to any of her scenes. She and Kelly dance pretty well together, technically, but without the slightest sense of partnership. Watching them, I got the impression that each would rather have been somewhere else. The music, despite such great numbers, seems to have been shoe-horned into the narrative and often, doesn't fit. The scene where Gershwin's rattlingly wonderful Concerto in F is performed, for instance, has nothing to do with anything else in the film. It does, however, provide moments of sweet relief from the limping story and embarrassingly stilted scenes. It's hard to believe that Oklahoma was released only four years later, in 1955 and yet, seems to belong to a different era. Oklahoma succeeds in every respect where An American in Paris fails. The acting is convincing, the story works well, the casting is faultless, the choreography - apart from the disappointing dream sequence - is sublime. But above all, the characters in Oklahoma perform with zest and sparkle in overdrive. That makes the film overflow with a sense of freshness, excitement and overflowing 'joy de vivre'. What a difference!

    After service in World War II, singer-dancer and struggling painter Gene Kelly (as Jerry Mulligan) settles on the Left Bank of Paris. His handsome features attract heiress Nina Foch (as Milo Roberts) and Mr. Kelly quickly becomes her escort. While out nightclubbing with his sponsor, Kelly sets he his sights on pretty young Leslie Caron (as Lise Bouvier). However, she is seeing local entertainer Georges Guetary (as Henri Baurel). Another American in Paris, pianist Oscar Levant (as Adam Cook), connects the lovers. Outstanding singing, dancing, impressions and setting in a too long and flimsy story; the art remains. ******** An American in Paris (8/26/51) Vincente Minnelli ~ Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant, Georges Guetary

    Fans of the movie genres known as "Musical", "Classic", and "Romance" and pure true lovers, lend me your ear. If you looking for the perfect romance musical, then the Oscar-winning "An American in Paris" is really the right movie for you. From the first minute, you, fellow viewer and reader, has been transformed into a cinematic world of lavishing color, enchanting magic and endless delights. After the end, even the whole movie stays with you for long as you can remember. This is the story of Jerry Mulligan {Gene Kelly}, a former American GI living in Paris making paintings and making friends with pianist Adam Cook {Oscar Levant} and singer Henri Baurel {Georges Guetary}. He soon finds love in the form of Lise Bouvier {Leslie Caron}, but soon romantic problems develop and Lise is not sure of what to do with her future with Jerry. This is one of the most delicious and most shining musicals around, and the superb score and choreography shows why this film feels not really dated. George and Ira Gershwin has mastered a genius of a lovely score right here, filled with so much many hummable songs such as "I Got Rhythm", "Our Love is Here to Stay", "Stairway to Paradise" and so much more. This is really and truly better than most of the music we have today. The choreography by Kelly is and truly a revelation. The most memorable of these, the ballet in the end, is one of the most ingenious and wondrous musical numbers we have ever seen in the history of the American musical. Kelly gives an everyday guy persona to Jerry. Once he becomes a character, we stay with him that way. The way he acts, the way he really dances, the way he sings, he really is a different type of a character. Caron really delivers in her first film role as Lise. She gives a lighting spark of radiance and power to the character. The moments that Kelly and Caron are together, the heart of romance goes aflutter and the viewer suddenly has gone love struck, rooting for them all the way. Even the supporting cast is feeling the magic as we speak. Levant is very funny and sensational. He delivers the film's comic moment when he conducts his own orchestra performing his own piece in a hilarious dream. Guetary is all dapper and gay. He is truly a wonder performing "Stairway to Paradise". Nina Foch also delivers as Jerry's society friend, Milo. She delivers one of the film's best one liners when waiting for a date with Jerry and another girl, Jerry asks "Who is the other girl?" Milo says "Me." Vincente Minnelli delivers a fantastic film here. Alan Jay Lerner's script is nothing short of delightful. The costumes and the sets by Orry-Kelly, Preston Kelly and Cedric Gibbons, respectively, are full of splendor and life. This is really a magnificent and can't miss film to watch not just by yourself, but for the whole entire family, even your pet. Rarely has a musical felt so much lovely and perfectly as this. My Pick: Green Light {See It}

    The story is surprisingly intense and actually eclipses the dancing sequences which are impressive. As much as the movies's plot may seem hokey and contrived, it really isn't. The story is plausible; people can fall in love immediately and get swept up in their emotions. Gene Kelly gives a great performance as an expatriate American and Leslie Caron proves to be dynamic in her role. The final dance sequence is incredible, combining several different dance forms. What makes this movie even stronger is that the story is simple, the characters likable and the music outstanding. The dream sequence with Oscar Levant was brilliant. There is nothing wrong with an upbeat movie featuring wonderfully talented actors who actually entertain. They sing, they dance, there is music and a happy ending. What's wrong with that? Nothing. This movie deserved the honors it received. Street Car and A Place in the Sun were marvelous movies, but a quality musical will trump a bleak, black-and-white drama anytime, like it did in 1951. Who would an audience rather watch: Gene Kelly laughing and dancing with Leslie Caron to the music of George Gershwin or gloomy Montgomery Clift plotting to kill a hapless Shelly Winters?

    I'e been a huge fan of "Singin' in the Rain" for quite some time now. I loved the songs, costumes, story, and actors in that one. I had heard of AAIP for a while, too. I've heard it was spectacular and decided to give it a whirl. It's not the worst I've ever seen, oh no. But definitely one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. First of all, Gene Kelly wasn't my favorite in SITR (I prefer Donald O'Connor). But I still thought he was alright. But he wasn't nearly as good in AAIP. His singing is okay here and there. But he doesn't do anything that makes me stare with wide eyes. I've always thought he was overrated. Not bad. But definitely overrated. And I didn't like his character much in this one, either. Also, his chemistry with Leslie Caron is not very believable, in my opinion. Speaking of Leslie, this was her first film. So I understand how she might be uncomfortable. But, am I the only one who doesn't think she's that pretty in this one? I thought she was fabulous in "Gigi" (1958). She was gorgeous and very talented in that one. But this one, she was missing something. But it was fun to watch her dance on pointe. Kelly's pal, Oscar Levant, is supposed to be the comic relief. Well, he wasn't at all comical, or at all a relief, for that matter. I loved his piano playing and I hope to be as good as him someday. But he was about as humorous as a brick and not a good actor, either. If you want a real good Gene Kelly pal, watch Donald O'Connor in SITR. He's actually funny and talented in many ways. So, I only gave this a 5 because of Levant's piano playing (which was magnificent), Kelly's "I Got Rhythmn" number with the little kids (but I do still prefer Judy Garland's version of the song), and the ballet at the end. As much as I love SITR, it's ballet was not as exciting. I did like the ballet in AAIP very much. So, all in all, it's a so-so movie. If you like that sort of thing, go ahead and watch it. But I'm warning you. You'd be much better off with watching "Singin' in the Rain".

    Movie musicals aren't my strong suit, but most of the time when I see one it manages to be entertaining enough. Gene Kelly has a way of making all of his dance moves seem effortlessly easy, and watching Leslie Caron keep in step with him is one of the highlights of the film. I wasn't too crazy about the romantic entanglements in the story, as Jerry Mulligan (Kelly) seemed better suited to end up with his sponsor Milo Roberts (Nina Foch); while Caron's character didn't seem to be a match for either Jerry or her fianc&eacute;e. I never could quite understand how a jilted lover, in this case Henri (Georges Guetary), manages to be so gallant in the end when his girlfriend goes off with another man. The main attraction here is the song and dance. Kelly is fun to watch in every one of his numbers, and the sequence featuring his pianist buddy Adam (Oscar Levant) was fairly innovative and entertaining. I got a kick out of the way Levant reacted to Henri's counsel for Jerry in matters of love and romance. Even though the picture relied heavily on extravagant use of color, it was interesting to see the gala black and white Mardi Gras style party in costumed splendor. As befitting the title of the picture, a couple more of the lavish dance sequences relied heavily on red, white and blue, an appropriate statement considering Kelly's character an ex-GI. This film made AFI's original Top 100 Movies of all time in 1997, but dropped off a decade later when the listing was revised in 2007. Considering it's competition for the Best Picture Oscar in 1952, namely "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun", it's curious to me how this one would have taken top honors, but I've stopped fretting about these things a long time ago. For my money, I'll take Kelly's follow up a year later, "Singin' in the Rain", but if you're a fan of movie musicals, there's enough entertainment value in both to keep one satisfied.

    Jerry Mulligan is a struggling American artist in Paris, he gets coveted by a rich heiress who can help his struggling career. However, a visit to a night club and a meeting with a delicate young, but spoken for, French girl, leads him into a battle with himself. Winner of seven Academy Awards, An American In Paris is of course a delightful and breezy picture from the MGM vault. Said to be the personal favourite movie of Gene Kelly, it boasts wonderful tunes from George & Ira Gershwin, brilliant art direction from Cedric Gibbons, vivid Technicolor that fills the eyes, and quite stunning choreography from Gene Kelly. The film, all told, is high on production value and entertaining enough from start to finish. Yet the film's plot is showing definite age problems now, and it also lacks the ode to joy sense of purpose that, for example, Singing In The Rain has. I also feel it's a missed opportunity to actually film the picture entirely on location in Paris instead of on the MGM lot, because a bit of earthy core feels missing from the unfolding story. Leslie Caron as the love rival to the smokingly hot older woman played by Nina Foch, is majestic dance wise, but acting she's very staid, and this too is an irritation. However, I still adore this film very much, just not as much as Gene and the Academy did, apparently! Come the grand finale it's hard to be too critical when so much energy and deftness of feet has been constructed for our entertainment. With such a production it's suffice to say that now, with all the technological advances made in home entertainment, An American in Paris is an High Definition essential. 7/10

    This is a film, I've found, about which nobody can ever be persuaded. It's too much an example of its various genres (musical, dance-fest, inevitable romance, exotic setting) to ever transcend them. That locks one's reaction to this undeniable classic of the studio system  "Made in Hollywood, U.S.A.," indeed  into whether one likes those genres. If you love any or all of George (and Ira) Gershwin's work, intricate choreography, ballet taken to literally Impressionistic heights, Paris long-shots (yes, the second unit did go there, it wasn't all done in Culver City), and happy endings, you'll dote on this film. If you can't stand plots that mainly tie musical performances together, actors who are chosen for dance or singing talent more than thespian skills, or back-lot artifice (yes, the brilliant 17-minute ballet at the end is the ultimate example), you won't see it twice. That makes one smoothly written appraisal difficult. It's full of elements popping up from each genre. It's the studio system at its most and least successful. (Not "worst." Nothing with the Gershwins' work can EVER be a "worst.") So I'll jump in to defend several elements against some strong criticisms. Some of this depends on remembering the elephant on those "Parisian" streets: There'd been a war on. ~ Gene Kelly (Jerry Mulligan): He's frequently derided as too old, either in absolute terms or relative to the rest of the cast. Not at all! Exuberant skill undercuts his physical age by at least 15 years here. It also makes Jerry's pursuit of Lise far more plausible. I'm sorry, but it's just not "stalking," then or now. It's elegantly converted from machismo, the kind that many women have complained about when seeing it ... and even more when they don't see it. Nor is Kelly so overambitious as to fit uncomfortably in a penniless-painter role, as some have said. It's too easy to forget that Jerry's been in Paris since the Second World War ended. That tore spirits or bodies apart for nearly all the Americans who fought in it, sooner or later, partly from most being forced into a crusader role they didn't want. This G.I. could need a few years to reawaken his capacity for talented work and fervent love. ~ Leslie Caron (Lise): She didn't show earnest or assertive acting until "Gigi," true enough. She was a brilliant dancing partner for Kelly, and not much more. (Those eyes and that smile, though, were to die for even at that age.) Yet consider Lise's back story, such as it is  losing her parents, Resistance fighters, before adolescence, and growing up with mentors instead. Wouldn't that have made her less confident about what the world would bring to her? She, as well as Mulligan, blossoms slowly after a dry spell. ~ Georges Gu&eacute;tary (Henri): He's the grounded contrast to Jerry's shallower-rooted American. His confidence and resilience aren't at all overblown. He's had a performing career and he's sticking to making the most of it, which will include Lise if it can, but will ultimately go on without her if it must. This boulevardier has a quiet persistence that isn't immediately evident. ~ Oscar Levant (Adam): No, he is not at all superfluous to the story, nor to the romantic entanglements. Just look at the scene in the caf&eacute; where he's sitting between Henri and Jerry, and only he knows that the others love the same girl. His frantic reactions, when the men unknowingly talk about the same object of affection, show priceless comic timing and subtly discharge any over-emotion. Levant was a brilliant pianist, and this friend of the composer had to have a Gershwin showcase. (The last movement of the "Concerto in F," where he's imagining himself also as orchestra, conductor, and audience.) Yet he's not a survivor, as Jerry and Lise are, and he's not above it all, as Henri is. He has unfulfilled ambition and imagination, yet stays involved enough in life to appreciate enthusiasm and stay connected to friends. His deflation of Jerry's sponsor at the end is not just a bon mot, but an act of loyalty. ~ Nina Foch (Milo): Okay, she's a bit too young and beautiful to be entirely convincing as Jerry's older patron. Yet she has the most acting skills of any of the main characters, and she takes a thankless position in the story and makes it both dignified and funny. Her possessiveness about Jerry is understandable and is offset by considerable good humor and charm. She has ambitions, romantic and otherwise, but she's not insincere about them, as out-sized as they may be. Milo's rising interest and final withdrawal are both quietly skilled and acted out in a minimum of screen time. ~ The plot: Yes, it mainly ties the music together and compresses events to make room. Yes, at times it makes Jerry too persistent, Adam too acerbic, Milo too grasping, Lise too unquestioning, Henri too accepting. Yet it remains remarkable for making so many genres work together at all! Alan Jay Lerner knew it was just functional (Oscar notwithstanding). It was meant to turn an artistic salad, with Gershwin lettuce, into a tasty meal for the viewer, and it more than succeeded in doing so. ... So is this, even for a lover of the Gershwins' music, anywhere near perfect? It comes very close. The plot more than exceeds the burdens put upon it, but it still has little resonance, so I take away one star. Yet the actors rise to their situations and show their strengths beautifully. It really comes down to one truth, as a lyric says: "Our love is here to stay." Not necessarily for the studio confectionery, or the mannered acting, or the utility plot. But for the incomparable Gershwins, and for what could be so ably strung upon their brilliance.

    I watched this movie 59 years after it was released (God bless technology) and what struck me most was the difference in the culture. The love connection that drives the story is created when he literally stalks her until she laughingly concedes after which point, their love is assumed as a given. And for the "other guy" to deliver his cheating fianc&eacute;e to him at the end of the movie WITH A SMILE(!!??!!) is so far beyond ridiculous, I'm not even sure I saw it right. There were other instances but I think I've made my point. I don't think the story was intended to be the real draw here. At least I hope not. The music and dancing were so good (Gene Kelly has more charm and charisma in any single scene than most Hollywood studios can dream of cramming into their products these days), that despite the story line and the relationships portrayed being mind-boggling, the movie is fun and engaging. What motivated the characters to make some of the decisions they made is simply beyond me but I guess it was just a different time with different social norms and since the real selling points of the movie (the Gershwins music and Gene Kelly's screen presence) needed the plot to go a certain way in order to do their thing, it just did and all told, that's fine with me. If it wasn't for Gene Kelly and the Gershwins, this movie would have been a non-starter but with their immeasurable talent, it is a movie worth watching. Leslie Caron as a leading lady was an epic fail but I'm sure a lot of the blame for that lies in the story itself. It cannot be easy to play a lady who switches from angrily saying "You are downright annoying!" to giggling and agreeing to meet for a date a split second later because he refused to take no for an answer. But that's just my two scents. ;)

    Jerry Mulligan (Gene Kelly) is a struggling American painter who quit his job in the army to pursue his passion in the sizzling Paris. His good friend includes Adam Cook (Oscar Levant) an unknown pianist who lives in an apartment nearby. Adam introduces Jerry to Henri Baurel (Georges Guetary) a popular local crooner, who is to marry a 'vivacious, modern, enchanting, fascinating, exciting, sweet, shy and scholarly' dancer Lise ( Jerry does not know about this, however). Jerry puts his landscape paintings on display along the brick walls in the streets of Paris, and makes a paltry living out of it. His character is somewhat nasty, but many struggling street artists whom I have met are actually nasty with their take-it-or-leave attitude. He meets Milo (Nina Foch) a middle-aged rich woman who takes fancy to his paintings and agrees to buy two of his works. However, it can be observed here how Milo is actually trying to woo Jerry, as she tells Jerry that she does not have enough money and invites him to her hotel room. Madonna of the 50s, I say! Jerry does not respond well to her advances and starts flirting unabashedly with a young girl at the pub aka Lise. Jerry gets her number and almost prowls her to fall in love with him, which she eventually does. Conversely, Lise sets out more traps for Jerry. The rest is well. obvious. The Oscar and Golden Globes Associations have infamously awarded lesser deserving films, actors, actresses, supporting actors, supporting actresses, documentaries, music, screenplay. For example, Sandra Bullock's tough white compassionate mother act that paled even in comparison to a similar tough mom act by Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich. Or take the complete failure of recognition of 1952s 'Singin' in The Rain', a definitive musical masterpiece also starring Gene Kelly, and my personal choice for the greatest film of the 20th century. But to see 'An American in Paris' win Best Picture and Best Screenplay (!!!) is an unexpected and somewhat sour surprise. Why? Because An American in Paris is an incomplete film, lacking a thorough script, thin of memorable songs and dance sequences, short of convincing performances and devoid of a proper conclusion. How can this be rewarded the best script when the last twenty minutes did not receive enough momentum from the first ninety minutes, thus making the entire attempt somewhat flat? Gene Kelly's larger-than-life, showy persona proved an advantage in 'SITR' but here, where he has to downplay his character, it militates his likability. Also, his treatment of Jean Hagen's Lena Lamont in SITR was correct because of Lena's demanding diva personality. But to behave in the same way with Milo in AAIP made him a bit of a cad, especially when he drops her like a brick in the end without even considering her feelings for once, that too when he was acting in the same fashion albeit to woo Lise. He also has this slightly putting off habit of acting and moving in an affected way that is paradoxical to his role. Watch the first scene where he gets up fully aware that there is a camera in front of him, and then performs various movements in a rehearsed fashion. Works well at times, especially during the sing and dance numbers but lacks trueness otherwise. Hard to blame him though, since many actors 'act' this way. Leslie Caron does not live up to all the qualities mentioned about her by Henri. She seems shy, somewhat traditional and even reticent, like Talia Shire's character in Rocky. It is only when she dances that there comes some personality in her. But she still does not have the desired screen presence during the numbers, and cannot stand out when performing in a group. Also her chemistry with Gene is often bland and one-sided; Gene at least manages to show some fondness towards her while Leslie looks as if she is just playing along with him. Henri can sing well and act charmingly, but his character too is poorly given the chauffeur/dad-who-opposes-then-concedes treatment. They could have had some dialog between Henri and Lise, since love can't be so easily given up. And don't get me started on the ridiculous superhero-like costumes both Gene and Henri were wearing in the otherwise serious scene before the final performance! Oscar Levant was utterly wasted; he had a promising back-story or whatever you call it. They could have especially done more after his daydreaming concert act to draw attention upon his unfulfilled desires of becoming famous before the party scene. Oscar Levant, like many other actors, just parrots his lines without adding any gravity to it. Nina Foch was the only actor truly worth mentioning here; she conveys her dry charm, furtiveness and ultimately disappointment well. All of the songs are melodious but not catchy. However, they have the French charm that gives fervor to the movie. Even 'My Fair Lady' had fabulous numbers but I cannot remember any; it is because unlike Singing in the Rain or Marry Poppins or Sound of Music, they don't carry indelible hooks. So it isn't a fault, just a lacking. But the fault was to place all these numbers in this film; they failed to add up and boost the finale. Conversely, SITR placed its numbers so well that the 12 minute Broadway Melody spectacle at the end was just dazzling. I have to commend the unique filming techniques in the film: Lise could not be described more wonderfully, the one-man band was clever and the theatrical finishing was ingenious. The performances, especially the one between Kelly and Guetary brought a smile to my face. But the movie itself disappointed me; it seems like a beta version when compared to Singing in the Rain, but as a standalone, it was underwhelming. My Rating: 5.5 out of 10

    Take an accomplished director, one of the world's most famous dancers, a dreamily romantic setting and music from none other than George Gershwin and what do you have? In the case of An American in Paris, you have a film which, for me, falls flat on its face. The winning combination of talent and reputation thrilled the critics, back in 1951 and the film was showered with awards including six Oscars. But, looked at coldly and in retrospect, it's difficult to understand why . Right from the opening scene, when Gene Kelly  who is supposed to be starving in a Paris garret  wakes up looking prosperous, over-confident and heavily made-up, you can already hear the turkey feathers starting to rustle. The story falters and bumbles its way through yawning intervals which separate the big numbers and the characters become less convincing with every scene. Leslie Caron, when she finally turns up, looks terrified and toothy and though she dances superbly, seems too timid to bring magic to any of her scenes. She and Kelly dance pretty well together, technically, but without the slightest sense of partnership. Watching them, I got the impression that each would rather have been somewhere else. The music, despite such great numbers, seems to have been shoe-horned into the narrative and often, doesn't fit. The scene where Gershwin's rattlingly wonderful Concerto in F is performed, for instance, has nothing to do with anything else in the film. It does, however, provide moments of sweet relief from the limping story and embarrassingly stilted scenes. It's hard to believe that Oklahoma was released only four years later, in 1955 and yet, seems to belong to a different era. Oklahoma succeeds in every respect where An American in Paris fails. The acting is convincing, the story works well, the casting is faultless, the choreography - apart from the disappointing dream sequence - is sublime. But above all, the characters in Oklahoma perform with zest and sparkle in overdrive. That makes the film overflow with a sense of freshness, excitement and overflowing 'joy de vivre'. What a difference!

    After service in World War II, singer-dancer and struggling painter Gene Kelly (as Jerry Mulligan) settles on the Left Bank of Paris. His handsome features attract heiress Nina Foch (as Milo Roberts) and Mr. Kelly quickly becomes her escort. While out nightclubbing with his sponsor, Kelly sets he his sights on pretty young Leslie Caron (as Lise Bouvier). However, she is seeing local entertainer Georges Guetary (as Henri Baurel). Another American in Paris, pianist Oscar Levant (as Adam Cook), connects the lovers. Outstanding singing, dancing, impressions and setting in a too long and flimsy story; the art remains. ******** An American in Paris (8/26/51) Vincente Minnelli ~ Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant, Georges Guetary

    Fans of the movie genres known as "Musical", "Classic", and "Romance" and pure true lovers, lend me your ear. If you looking for the perfect romance musical, then the Oscar-winning "An American in Paris" is really the right movie for you. From the first minute, you, fellow viewer and reader, has been transformed into a cinematic world of lavishing color, enchanting magic and endless delights. After the end, even the whole movie stays with you for long as you can remember. This is the story of Jerry Mulligan {Gene Kelly}, a former American GI living in Paris making paintings and making friends with pianist Adam Cook {Oscar Levant} and singer Henri Baurel {Georges Guetary}. He soon finds love in the form of Lise Bouvier {Leslie Caron}, but soon romantic problems develop and Lise is not sure of what to do with her future with Jerry. This is one of the most delicious and most shining musicals around, and the superb score and choreography shows why this film feels not really dated. George and Ira Gershwin has mastered a genius of a lovely score right here, filled with so much many hummable songs such as "I Got Rhythm", "Our Love is Here to Stay", "Stairway to Paradise" and so much more. This is really and truly better than most of the music we have today. The choreography by Kelly is and truly a revelation. The most memorable of these, the ballet in the end, is one of the most ingenious and wondrous musical numbers we have ever seen in the history of the American musical. Kelly gives an everyday guy persona to Jerry. Once he becomes a character, we stay with him that way. The way he acts, the way he really dances, the way he sings, he really is a different type of a character. Caron really delivers in her first film role as Lise. She gives a lighting spark of radiance and power to the character. The moments that Kelly and Caron are together, the heart of romance goes aflutter and the viewer suddenly has gone love struck, rooting for them all the way. Even the supporting cast is feeling the magic as we speak. Levant is very funny and sensational. He delivers the film's comic moment when he conducts his own orchestra performing his own piece in a hilarious dream. Guetary is all dapper and gay. He is truly a wonder performing "Stairway to Paradise". Nina Foch also delivers as Jerry's society friend, Milo. She delivers one of the film's best one liners when waiting for a date with Jerry and another girl, Jerry asks "Who is the other girl?" Milo says "Me." Vincente Minnelli delivers a fantastic film here. Alan Jay Lerner's script is nothing short of delightful. The costumes and the sets by Orry-Kelly, Preston Kelly and Cedric Gibbons, respectively, are full of splendor and life. This is really a magnificent and can't miss film to watch not just by yourself, but for the whole entire family, even your pet. Rarely has a musical felt so much lovely and perfectly as this.

    The story is surprisingly intense and actually eclipses the dancing sequences which are impressive. As much as the movies's plot may seem hokey and contrived, it really isn't. The story is plausible; people can fall in love immediately and get swept up in their emotions. Gene Kelly gives a great performance as an expatriate American and Leslie Caron proves to be dynamic in her role. The final dance sequence is incredible, combining several different dance forms. What makes this movie even stronger is that the story is simple, the characters likable and the music outstanding. The dream sequence with Oscar Levant was brilliant. There is nothing wrong with an upbeat movie featuring wonderfully talented actors who actually entertain. They sing, they dance, there is music and a happy ending. What's wrong with that? Nothing. This movie deserved the honors it received. Street Car and A Place in the Sun were marvelous movies, but a quality musical will trump a bleak, black-and-white drama anytime, like it did in 1951. Who would an audience rather watch: Gene Kelly laughing and dancing with Leslie Caron to the music of George Gershwin or gloomy Montgomery Clift plotting to kill a hapless Shelly Winters?

    I'e been a huge fan of "Singin' in the Rain" for quite some time now. I loved the songs, costumes, story, and actors in that one. I had heard of AAIP for a while, too. I've heard it was spectacular and decided to give it a whirl. It's not the worst I've ever seen, oh no. But definitely one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. First of all, Gene Kelly wasn't my favorite in SITR (I prefer Donald O'Connor). But I still thought he was alright. But he wasn't nearly as good in AAIP. His singing is okay here and there. But he doesn't do anything that makes me stare with wide eyes. I've always thought he was overrated. Not bad. But definitely overrated. And I didn't like his character much in this one, either. Also, his chemistry with Leslie Caron is not very believable, in my opinion. Speaking of Leslie, this was her first film. So I understand how she might be uncomfortable. But, am I the only one who doesn't think she's that pretty in this one? I thought she was fabulous in "Gigi" (1958). She was gorgeous and very talented in that one. But this one, she was missing something. But it was fun to watch her dance on pointe. Kelly's pal, Oscar Levant, is supposed to be the comic relief. Well, he wasn't at all comical, or at all a relief, for that matter. I loved his piano playing and I hope to be as good as him someday. But he was about as humorous as a brick and not a good actor, either. If you want a real good Gene Kelly pal, watch Donald O'Connor in SITR. He's actually funny and talented in many ways. So, I only gave this a 5 because of Levant's piano playing (which was magnificent), Kelly's "I Got Rhythmn" number with the little kids (but I do still prefer Judy Garland's version of the song), and the ballet at the end. As much as I love SITR, it's ballet was not as exciting. I did like the ballet in AAIP very much. So, all in all, it's a so-so movie. If you like that sort of thing, go ahead and watch it. But I'm warning you. You'd be much better off with watching "Singin' in the Rain".

    Movie musicals aren't my strong suit, but most of the time when I see one it manages to be entertaining enough. Gene Kelly has a way of making all of his dance moves seem effortlessly easy, and watching Leslie Caron keep in step with him is one of the highlights of the film. I wasn't too crazy about the romantic entanglements in the story, as Jerry Mulligan (Kelly) seemed better suited to end up with his sponsor Milo Roberts (Nina Foch); while Caron's character didn't seem to be a match for either Jerry or her fianc&eacute;e. I never could quite understand how a jilted lover, in this case Henri (Georges Guetary), manages to be so gallant in the end when his girlfriend goes off with another man. The main attraction here is the song and dance. Kelly is fun to watch in every one of his numbers, and the sequence featuring his pianist buddy Adam (Oscar Levant) was fairly innovative and entertaining. I got a kick out of the way Levant reacted to Henri's counsel for Jerry in matters of love and romance. Even though the picture relied heavily on extravagant use of color, it was interesting to see the gala black and white Mardi Gras style party in costumed splendor. As befitting the title of the picture, a couple more of the lavish dance sequences relied heavily on red, white and blue, an appropriate statement considering Kelly's character an ex-GI. This film made AFI's original Top 100 Movies of all time in 1997, but dropped off a decade later when the listing was revised in 2007. Considering it's competition for the Best Picture Oscar in 1952, namely "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun", it's curious to me how this one would have taken top honors, but I've stopped fretting about these things a long time ago. For my money, I'll take Kelly's follow up a year later, "Singin' in the Rain", but if you're a fan of movie musicals, there's enough entertainment value in both to keep one satisfied.

    Jerry Mulligan is a struggling American artist in Paris, he gets coveted by a rich heiress who can help his struggling career. However, a visit to a night club and a meeting with a delicate young, but spoken for, French girl, leads him into a battle with himself. Winner of seven Academy Awards, An American In Paris is of course a delightful and breezy picture from the MGM vault. Said to be the personal favourite movie of Gene Kelly, it boasts wonderful tunes from George & Ira Gershwin, brilliant art direction from Cedric Gibbons, vivid Technicolor that fills the eyes, and quite stunning choreography from Gene Kelly. The film, all told, is high on production value and entertaining enough from start to finish. Yet the film's plot is showing definite age problems now, and it also lacks the ode to joy sense of purpose that, for example, Singing In The Rain has. I also feel it's a missed opportunity to actually film the picture entirely on location in Paris instead of on the MGM lot, because a bit of earthy core feels missing from the unfolding story. Leslie Caron as the love rival to the smokingly hot older woman played by Nina Foch, is majestic dance wise, but acting she's very staid, and this too is an irritation. However, I still adore this film very much, just not as much as Gene and the Academy did, apparently! Come the grand finale it's hard to be too critical when so much energy and deftness of feet has been constructed for our entertainment. With such a production it's suffice to say that now, with all the technological advances made in home entertainment, An American in Paris is an High Definition essential. 7/10

    This is a film, I've found, about which nobody can ever be persuaded. It's too much an example of its various genres (musical, dance-fest, inevitable romance, exotic setting) to ever transcend them. That locks one's reaction to this undeniable classic of the studio system  "Made in Hollywood, U.S.A.," indeed  into whether one likes those genres. If you love any or all of George (and Ira) Gershwin's work, intricate choreography, ballet taken to literally Impressionistic heights, Paris long-shots (yes, the second unit did go there, it wasn't all done in Culver City), and happy endings, you'll dote on this film. If you can't stand plots that mainly tie musical performances together, actors who are chosen for dance or singing talent more than thespian skills, or back-lot artifice (yes, the brilliant 17-minute ballet at the end is the ultimate example), you won't see it twice. That makes one smoothly written appraisal difficult. It's full of elements popping up from each genre. It's the studio system at its most and least successful. (Not "worst." Nothing with the Gershwins' work can EVER be a "worst.") So I'll jump in to defend several elements against some strong criticisms. Some of this depends on remembering the elephant on those "Parisian" streets: There'd been a war on. ~ Gene Kelly (Jerry Mulligan): He's frequently derided as too old, either in absolute terms or relative to the rest of the cast. Not at all! Exuberant skill undercuts his physical age by at least 15 years here. It also makes Jerry's pursuit of Lise far more plausible. I'm sorry, but it's just not "stalking," then or now. It's elegantly converted from machismo, the kind that many women have complained about when seeing it ... and even more when they don't see it. Nor is Kelly so overambitious as to fit uncomfortably in a penniless-painter role, as some have said. It's too easy to forget that Jerry's been in Paris since the Second World War ended. That tore spirits or bodies apart for nearly all the Americans who fought in it, sooner or later, partly from most being forced into a crusader role they didn't want. This G.I. could need a few years to reawaken his capacity for talented work and fervent love. ~ Leslie Caron (Lise): She didn't show earnest or assertive acting until "Gigi," true enough. She was a brilliant dancing partner for Kelly, and not much more. (Those eyes and that smile, though, were to die for even at that age.) Yet consider Lise's back story, such as it is  losing her parents, Resistance fighters, before adolescence, and growing up with mentors instead. Wouldn't that have made her less confident about what the world would bring to her? She, as well as Mulligan, blossoms slowly after a dry spell. ~ Georges Gu&eacute;tary (Henri): He's the grounded contrast to Jerry's shallower-rooted American. His confidence and resilience aren't at all overblown. He's had a performing career and he's sticking to making the most of it, which will include Lise if it can, but will ultimately go on without her if it must. This boulevardier has a quiet persistence that isn't immediately evident. ~ Oscar Levant (Adam): No, he is not at all superfluous to the story, nor to the romantic entanglements. Just look at the scene in the caf&eacute; where he's sitting between Henri and Jerry, and only he knows that the others love the same girl. His frantic reactions, when the men unknowingly talk about the same object of affection, show priceless comic timing and subtly discharge any over-emotion. Levant was a brilliant pianist, and this friend of the composer had to have a Gershwin showcase. (The last movement of the "Concerto in F," where he's imagining himself also as orchestra, conductor, and audience.) Yet he's not a survivor, as Jerry and Lise are, and he's not above it all, as Henri is. He has unfulfilled ambition and imagination, yet stays involved enough in life to appreciate enthusiasm and stay connected to friends. His deflation of Jerry's sponsor at the end is not just a bon mot, but an act of loyalty. ~ Nina Foch (Milo): Okay, she's a bit too young and beautiful to be entirely convincing as Jerry's older patron. Yet she has the most acting skills of any of the main characters, and she takes a thankless position in the story and makes it both dignified and funny. Her possessiveness about Jerry is understandable and is offset by considerable good humor and charm. She has ambitions, romantic and otherwise, but she's not insincere about them, as out-sized as they may be. Milo's rising interest and final withdrawal are both quietly skilled and acted out in a minimum of screen time. ~ The plot: Yes, it mainly ties the music together and compresses events to make room. Yes, at times it makes Jerry too persistent, Adam too acerbic, Milo too grasping, Lise too unquestioning, Henri too accepting. Yet it remains remarkable for making so many genres work together at all! Alan Jay Lerner knew it was just functional (Oscar notwithstanding). It was meant to turn an artistic salad, with Gershwin lettuce, into a tasty meal for the viewer, and it more than succeeded in doing so. ... So is this, even for a lover of the Gershwins' music, anywhere near perfect? It comes very close. The plot more than exceeds the burdens put upon it, but it still has little resonance, so I take away one star. Yet the actors rise to their situations and show their strengths beautifully. It really comes down to one truth, as a lyric says: "Our love is here to stay." Not necessarily for the studio confectionery, or the mannered acting, or the utility plot. But for the incomparable Gershwins, and for what could be so ably strung upon their brilliance.

    I watched this movie 59 years after it was released (God bless technology) and what struck me most was the difference in the culture. The love connection that drives the story is created when he literally stalks her until she laughingly concedes after which point, their love is assumed as a given. And for the "other guy" to deliver his cheating fianc&eacute;e to him at the end of the movie WITH A SMILE(!!??!!) is so far beyond ridiculous, I'm not even sure I saw it right. There were other instances but I think I've made my point. I don't think the story was intended to be the real draw here. At least I hope not. The music and dancing were so good (Gene Kelly has more charm and charisma in any single scene than most Hollywood studios can dream of cramming into their products these days), that despite the story line and the relationships portrayed being mind-boggling, the movie is fun and engaging. What motivated the characters to make some of the decisions they made is simply beyond me but I guess it was just a different time with different social norms and since the real selling points of the movie (the Gershwins music and Gene Kelly's screen presence) needed the plot to go a certain way in order to do their thing, it just did and all told, that's fine with me. If it wasn't for Gene Kelly and the Gershwins, this movie would have been a non-starter but with their immeasurable talent, it is a movie worth watching. Leslie Caron as a leading lady was an epic fail but I'm sure a lot of the blame for that lies in the story itself. It cannot be easy to play a lady who switches from angrily saying "You are downright annoying!" to giggling and agreeing to meet for a date a split second later because he refused to take no for an answer. But that's just my two scents. ;)

    Jerry Mulligan (Gene Kelly) is a struggling American painter who quit his job in the army to pursue his passion in the sizzling Paris. His good friend includes Adam Cook (Oscar Levant) an unknown pianist who lives in an apartment nearby. Adam introduces Jerry to Henri Baurel (Georges Guetary) a popular local crooner, who is to marry a 'vivacious, modern, enchanting, fascinating, exciting, sweet, shy and scholarly' dancer Lise ( Jerry does not know about this, however). Jerry puts his landscape paintings on display along the brick walls in the streets of Paris, and makes a paltry living out of it. His character is somewhat nasty, but many struggling street artists whom I have met are actually nasty with their take-it-or-leave attitude. He meets Milo (Nina Foch) a middle-aged rich woman who takes fancy to his paintings and agrees to buy two of his works. However, it can be observed here how Milo is actually trying to woo Jerry, as she tells Jerry that she does not have enough money and invites him to her hotel room. Madonna of the 50s, I say! Jerry does not respond well to her advances and starts flirting unabashedly with a young girl at the pub aka Lise. Jerry gets her number and almost prowls her to fall in love with him, which she eventually does. Conversely, Lise sets out more traps for Jerry. The rest is well. obvious. The Oscar and Golden Globes Associations have infamously awarded lesser deserving films, actors, actresses, supporting actors, supporting actresses, documentaries, music, screenplay. For example, Sandra Bullock's tough white compassionate mother act that paled even in comparison to a similar tough mom act by Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich. Or take the complete failure of recognition of 1952s 'Singin' in The Rain', a definitive musical masterpiece also starring Gene Kelly, and my personal choice for the greatest film of the 20th century. But to see 'An American in Paris' win Best Picture and Best Screenplay (!!!) is an unexpected and somewhat sour surprise. Why? Because An American in Paris is an incomplete film, lacking a thorough script, thin of memorable songs and dance sequences, short of convincing performances and devoid of a proper conclusion. How can this be rewarded the best script when the last twenty minutes did not receive enough momentum from the first ninety minutes, thus making the entire attempt somewhat flat? Gene Kelly's larger-than-life, showy persona proved an advantage in 'SITR' but here, where he has to downplay his character, it militates his likability. Also, his treatment of Jean Hagen's Lena Lamont in SITR was correct because of Lena's demanding diva personality. But to behave in the same way with Milo in AAIP made him a bit of a cad, especially when he drops her like a brick in the end without even considering her feelings for once, that too when he was acting in the same fashion albeit to woo Lise. He also has this slightly putting off habit of acting and moving in an affected way that is paradoxical to his role. Watch the first scene where he gets up fully aware that there is a camera in front of him, and then performs various movements in a rehearsed fashion. Works well at times, especially during the sing and dance numbers but lacks trueness otherwise. Hard to blame him though, since many actors 'act' this way. Leslie Caron does not live up to all the qualities mentioned about her by Henri. She seems shy, somewhat traditional and even reticent, like Talia Shire's character in Rocky. It is only when she dances that there comes some personality in her. But she still does not have the desired screen presence during the numbers, and cannot stand out when performing in a group. Also her chemistry with Gene is often bland and one-sided; Gene at least manages to show some fondness towards her while Leslie looks as if she is just playing along with him. Henri can sing well and act charmingly, but his character too is poorly given the chauffeur/dad-who-opposes-then-concedes treatment. They could have had some dialog between Henri and Lise, since love can't be so easily given up. And don't get me started on the ridiculous superhero-like costumes both Gene and Henri were wearing in the otherwise serious scene before the final performance! Oscar Levant was utterly wasted; he had a promising back-story or whatever you call it. They could have especially done more after his daydreaming concert act to draw attention upon his unfulfilled desires of becoming famous before the party scene. Oscar Levant, like many other actors, just parrots his lines without adding any gravity to it. Nina Foch was the only actor truly worth mentioning here; she conveys her dry charm, furtiveness and ultimately disappointment well. All of the songs are melodious but not catchy. However, they have the French charm that gives fervor to the movie. Even 'My Fair Lady' had fabulous numbers but I cannot remember any; it is because unlike Singing in the Rain or Marry Poppins or Sound of Music, they don't carry indelible hooks. So it isn't a fault, just a lacking. But the fault was to place all these numbers in this film; they failed to add up and boost the finale. Conversely, SITR placed its numbers so well that the 12 minute Broadway Melody spectacle at the end was just dazzling. I have to commend the unique filming techniques in the film: Lise could not be described more wonderfully, the one-man band was clever and the theatrical finishing was ingenious. The performances, especially the one between Kelly and Guetary brought a smile to my face. But the movie itself disappointed me; it seems like a beta version when compared to Singing in the Rain, but as a standalone, it was underwhelming. My Rating: 5.5 out of 10

    Take an accomplished director, one of the world's most famous dancers, a dreamily romantic setting and music from none other than George Gershwin and what do you have? In the case of An American in Paris, you have a film which, for me, falls flat on its face. The winning combination of talent and reputation thrilled the critics, back in 1951 and the film was showered with awards including six Oscars. But, looked at coldly and in retrospect, it's difficult to understand why . Right from the opening scene, when Gene Kelly  who is supposed to be starving in a Paris garret  wakes up looking prosperous, over-confident and heavily made-up, you can already hear the turkey feathers starting to rustle. The story falters and bumbles its way through yawning intervals which separate the big numbers and the characters become less convincing with every scene. Leslie Caron, when she finally turns up, looks terrified and toothy and though she dances superbly, seems too timid to bring magic to any of her scenes. She and Kelly dance pretty well together, technically, but without the slightest sense of partnership. Watching them, I got the impression that each would rather have been somewhere else. The music, despite such great numbers, seems to have been shoe-horned into the narrative and often, doesn't fit. The scene where Gershwin's rattlingly wonderful Concerto in F is performed, for instance, has nothing to do with anything else in the film. It does, however, provide moments of sweet relief from the limping story and embarrassingly stilted scenes. It's hard to believe that Oklahoma was released only four years later, in 1955 and yet, seems to belong to a different era. Oklahoma succeeds in every respect where An American in Paris fails. The acting is convincing, the story works well, the casting is faultless, the choreography - apart from the disappointing dream sequence - is sublime. But above all, the characters in Oklahoma perform with zest and sparkle in overdrive. That makes the film overflow with a sense of freshness, excitement and overflowing 'joy de vivre'. What a difference!

    Fans of the movie genres known as "Musical", "Classic", and "Romance" and pure true lovers, lend me your ear. If you looking for the perfect romance musical, then the Oscar-winning "An American in Paris" is really the right movie for you. From the first minute, you, fellow viewer and reader, has been transformed into a cinematic world of lavishing color, enchanting magic and endless delights. After the end, even the whole movie stays with you for long as you can remember. This is the story of Jerry Mulligan {Gene Kelly}, a former American GI living in Paris making paintings and making friends with pianist Adam Cook {Oscar Levant} and singer Henri Baurel {Georges Guetary}. He soon finds love in the form of Lise Bouvier {Leslie Caron}, but soon romantic problems develop and Lise is not sure of what to do with her future with Jerry. This is one of the most delicious and most shining musicals around, and the superb score and choreography shows why this film feels not really dated. George and Ira Gershwin has mastered a genius of a lovely score right here, filled with so much many hummable songs such as "I Got Rhythm", "Our Love is Here to Stay", "Stairway to Paradise" and so much more. This is really and truly better than most of the music we have today. The choreography by Kelly is and truly a revelation. The most memorable of these, the ballet in the end, is one of the most ingenious and wondrous musical numbers we have ever seen in the history of the American musical. Kelly gives an everyday guy persona to Jerry. Once he becomes a character, we stay with him that way. The way he acts, the way he really dances, the way he sings, he really is a different type of a character. Caron really delivers in her first film role as Lise. She gives a lighting spark of radiance and power to the character. The moments that Kelly and Caron are together, the heart of romance goes aflutter and the viewer suddenly has gone love struck, rooting for them all the way. Even the supporting cast is feeling the magic as we speak. Levant is very funny and sensational. He delivers the film's comic moment when he conducts his own orchestra performing his own piece in a hilarious dream. Guetary is all dapper and gay. He is truly a wonder performing "Stairway to Paradise". Nina Foch also delivers as Jerry's society friend, Milo. She delivers one of the film's best one liners when waiting for a date with Jerry and another girl, Jerry asks "Who is the other girl?" Milo says "Me." Vincente Minnelli delivers a fantastic film here. Alan Jay Lerner's script is nothing short of delightful. The costumes and the sets by Orry-Kelly, Preston Kelly and Cedric Gibbons, respectively, are full of splendor and life. This is really a magnificent and can't miss film to watch not just by yourself, but for the whole entire family, even your pet. Rarely has a musical felt so much lovely and perfectly as this.

    The story is surprisingly intense and actually eclipses the dancing sequences which are impressive. As much as the movies's plot may seem hokey and contrived, it really isn't. The story is plausible; people can fall in love immediately and get swept up in their emotions. Gene Kelly gives a great performance as an expatriate American and Leslie Caron proves to be dynamic in her role. The final dance sequence is incredible, combining several different dance forms. What makes this movie even stronger is that the story is simple, the characters likable and the music outstanding. The dream sequence with Oscar Levant was brilliant. There is nothing wrong with an upbeat movie featuring wonderfully talented actors who actually entertain. They sing, they dance, there is music and a happy ending. What's wrong with that? Nothing. This movie deserved the honors it received. Street Car and A Place in the Sun were marvelous movies, but a quality musical will trump a bleak, black-and-white drama anytime, like it did in 1951. Who would an audience rather watch: Gene Kelly laughing and dancing with Leslie Caron to the music of George Gershwin or gloomy Montgomery Clift plotting to kill a hapless Shelly Winters?

    I'e been a huge fan of "Singin' in the Rain" for quite some time now. I loved the songs, costumes, story, and actors in that one. I had heard of AAIP for a while, too. I've heard it was spectacular and decided to give it a whirl. It's not the worst I've ever seen, oh no. But definitely one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. First of all, Gene Kelly wasn't my favorite in SITR (I prefer Donald O'Connor). But I still thought he was alright. But he wasn't nearly as good in AAIP. His singing is okay here and there. But he doesn't do anything that makes me stare with wide eyes. I've always thought he was overrated. Not bad. But definitely overrated. And I didn't like his character much in this one, either. Also, his chemistry with Leslie Caron is not very believable, in my opinion. Speaking of Leslie, this was her first film. So I understand how she might be uncomfortable. But, am I the only one who doesn't think she's that pretty in this one? I thought she was fabulous in "Gigi" (1958). She was gorgeous and very talented in that one. But this one, she was missing something. But it was fun to watch her dance on pointe. Kelly's pal, Oscar Levant, is supposed to be the comic relief. Well, he wasn't at all comical, or at all a relief, for that matter. I loved his piano playing and I hope to be as good as him someday. But he was about as humorous as a brick and not a good actor, either. If you want a real good Gene Kelly pal, watch Donald O'Connor in SITR. He's actually funny and talented in many ways. So, I only gave this a 5 because of Levant's piano playing (which was magnificent), Kelly's "I Got Rhythmn" number with the little kids (but I do still prefer Judy Garland's version of the song), and the ballet at the end. As much as I love SITR, it's ballet was not as exciting. I did like the ballet in AAIP very much. So, all in all, it's a so-so movie. If you like that sort of thing, go ahead and watch it. But I'm warning you. You'd be much better off with watching "Singin' in the Rain".

    Movie musicals aren't my strong suit, but most of the time when I see one it manages to be entertaining enough. Gene Kelly has a way of making all of his dance moves seem effortlessly easy, and watching Leslie Caron keep in step with him is one of the highlights of the film. I wasn't too crazy about the romantic entanglements in the story, as Jerry Mulligan (Kelly) seemed better suited to end up with his sponsor Milo Roberts (Nina Foch); while Caron's character didn't seem to be a match for either Jerry or her fianc&eacute;e. I never could quite understand how a jilted lover, in this case Henri (Georges Guetary), manages to be so gallant in the end when his girlfriend goes off with another man. The main attraction here is the song and dance. Kelly is fun to watch in every one of his numbers, and the sequence featuring his pianist buddy Adam (Oscar Levant) was fairly innovative and entertaining. I got a kick out of the way Levant reacted to Henri's counsel for Jerry in matters of love and romance. Even though the picture relied heavily on extravagant use of color, it was interesting to see the gala black and white Mardi Gras style party in costumed splendor. As befitting the title of the picture, a couple more of the lavish dance sequences relied heavily on red, white and blue, an appropriate statement considering Kelly's character an ex-GI. This film made AFI's original Top 100 Movies of all time in 1997, but dropped off a decade later when the listing was revised in 2007. Considering it's competition for the Best Picture Oscar in 1952, namely "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun", it's curious to me how this one would have taken top honors, but I've stopped fretting about these things a long time ago. For my money, I'll take Kelly's follow up a year later, "Singin' in the Rain", but if you're a fan of movie musicals, there's enough entertainment value in both to keep one satisfied.

    Jerry Mulligan is a struggling American artist in Paris, he gets coveted by a rich heiress who can help his struggling career. However, a visit to a night club and a meeting with a delicate young, but spoken for, French girl, leads him into a battle with himself. Winner of seven Academy Awards, An American In Paris is of course a delightful and breezy picture from the MGM vault. Said to be the personal favourite movie of Gene Kelly, it boasts wonderful tunes from George & Ira Gershwin, brilliant art direction from Cedric Gibbons, vivid Technicolor that fills the eyes, and quite stunning choreography from Gene Kelly. The film, all told, is high on production value and entertaining enough from start to finish. Yet the film's plot is showing definite age problems now, and it also lacks the ode to joy sense of purpose that, for example, Singing In The Rain has. I also feel it's a missed opportunity to actually film the picture entirely on location in Paris instead of on the MGM lot, because a bit of earthy core feels missing from the unfolding story. Leslie Caron as the love rival to the smokingly hot older woman played by Nina Foch, is majestic dance wise, but acting she's very staid, and this too is an irritation. However, I still adore this film very much, just not as much as Gene and the Academy did, apparently! Come the grand finale it's hard to be too critical when so much energy and deftness of feet has been constructed for our entertainment. With such a production it's suffice to say that now, with all the technological advances made in home entertainment, An American in Paris is an High Definition essential. 7/10

    This is a film, I've found, about which nobody can ever be persuaded. It's too much an example of its various genres (musical, dance-fest, inevitable romance, exotic setting) to ever transcend them. That locks one's reaction to this undeniable classic of the studio system  "Made in Hollywood, U.S.A.," indeed  into whether one likes those genres. If you love any or all of George (and Ira) Gershwin's work, intricate choreography, ballet taken to literally Impressionistic heights, Paris long-shots (yes, the second unit did go there, it wasn't all done in Culver City), and happy endings, you'll dote on this film. If you can't stand plots that mainly tie musical performances together, actors who are chosen for dance or singing talent more than thespian skills, or back-lot artifice (yes, the brilliant 17-minute ballet at the end is the ultimate example), you won't see it twice. That makes one smoothly written appraisal difficult. It's full of elements popping up from each genre. It's the studio system at its most and least successful. (Not "worst." Nothing with the Gershwins' work can EVER be a "worst.") So I'll jump in to defend several elements against some strong criticisms. Some of this depends on remembering the elephant on those "Parisian" streets: There'd been a war on. ~ Gene Kelly (Jerry Mulligan): He's frequently derided as too old, either in absolute terms or relative to the rest of the cast. Not at all! Exuberant skill undercuts his physical age by at least 15 years here. It also makes Jerry's pursuit of Lise far more plausible. I'm sorry, but it's just not "stalking," then or now. It's elegantly converted from machismo, the kind that many women have complained about when seeing it ... and even more when they don't see it. Nor is Kelly so overambitious as to fit uncomfortably in a penniless-painter role, as some have said. It's too easy to forget that Jerry's been in Paris since the Second World War ended. That tore spirits or bodies apart for nearly all the Americans who fought in it, sooner or later, partly from most being forced into a crusader role they didn't want. This G.I. could need a few years to reawaken his capacity for talented work and fervent love. ~ Leslie Caron (Lise): She didn't show earnest or assertive acting until "Gigi," true enough. She was a brilliant dancing partner for Kelly, and not much more. (Those eyes and that smile, though, were to die for even at that age.) Yet consider Lise's back story, such as it is  losing her parents, Resistance fighters, before adolescence, and growing up with mentors instead. Wouldn't that have made her less confident about what the world would bring to her? She, as well as Mulligan, blossoms slowly after a dry spell. ~ Georges Gu&eacute;tary (Henri): He's the grounded contrast to Jerry's shallower-rooted American. His confidence and resilience aren't at all overblown. He's had a performing career and he's sticking to making the most of it, which will include Lise if it can, but will ultimately go on without her if it must. This boulevardier has a quiet persistence that isn't immediately evident. ~ Oscar Levant (Adam): No, he is not at all superfluous to the story, nor to the romantic entanglements. Just look at the scene in the caf&eacute; where he's sitting between Henri and Jerry, and only he knows that the others love the same girl. His frantic reactions, when the men unknowingly talk about the same object of affection, show priceless comic timing and subtly discharge any over-emotion. Levant was a brilliant pianist, and this friend of the composer had to have a Gershwin showcase. (The last movement of the "Concerto in F," where he's imagining himself also as orchestra, conductor, and audience.) Yet he's not a survivor, as Jerry and Lise are, and he's not above it all, as Henri is. He has unfulfilled ambition and imagination, yet stays involved enough in life to appreciate enthusiasm and stay connected to friends. His deflation of Jerry's sponsor at the end is not just a bon mot, but an act of loyalty. ~ Nina Foch (Milo): Okay, she's a bit too young and beautiful to be entirely convincing as Jerry's older patron. Yet she has the most acting skills of any of the main characters, and she takes a thankless position in the story and makes it both dignified and funny. Her possessiveness about Jerry is understandable and is offset by considerable good humor and charm. She has ambitions, romantic and otherwise, but she's not insincere about them, as out-sized as they may be. Milo's rising interest and final withdrawal are both quietly skilled and acted out in a minimum of screen time. ~ The plot: Yes, it mainly ties the music together and compresses events to make room. Yes, at times it makes Jerry too persistent, Adam too acerbic, Milo too grasping, Lise too unquestioning, Henri too accepting. Yet it remains remarkable for making so many genres work together at all! Alan Jay Lerner knew it was just functional (Oscar notwithstanding). It was meant to turn an artistic salad, with Gershwin lettuce, into a tasty meal for the viewer, and it more than succeeded in doing so. ... So is this, even for a lover of the Gershwins' music, anywhere near perfect? It comes very close. The plot more than exceeds the burdens put upon it, but it still has little resonance, so I take away one star. Yet the actors rise to their situations and show their strengths beautifully. It really comes down to one truth, as a lyric says: "Our love is here to stay." Not necessarily for the studio confectionery, or the mannered acting, or the utility plot. But for the incomparable Gershwins, and for what could be so ably strung upon their brilliance.

    I watched this movie 59 years after it was released (God bless technology) and what struck me most was the difference in the culture. The love connection that drives the story is created when he literally stalks her until she laughingly concedes after which point, their love is assumed as a given. And for the "other guy" to deliver his cheating fianc&eacute;e to him at the end of the movie WITH A SMILE(!!??!!) is so far beyond ridiculous, I'm not even sure I saw it right. There were other instances but I think I've made my point. I don't think the story was intended to be the real draw here. At least I hope not. The music and dancing were so good (Gene Kelly has more charm and charisma in any single scene than most Hollywood studios can dream of cramming into their products these days), that despite the story line and the relationships portrayed being mind-boggling, the movie is fun and engaging. What motivated the characters to make some of the decisions they made is simply beyond me but I guess it was just a different time with different social norms and since the real selling points of the movie (the Gershwins music and Gene Kelly's screen presence) needed the plot to go a certain way in order to do their thing, it just did and all told, that's fine with me. If it wasn't for Gene Kelly and the Gershwins, this movie would have been a non-starter but with their immeasurable talent, it is a movie worth watching. Leslie Caron as a leading lady was an epic fail but I'm sure a lot of the blame for that lies in the story itself. It cannot be easy to play a lady who switches from angrily saying "You are downright annoying!" to giggling and agreeing to meet for a date a split second later because he refused to take no for an answer. But that's just my two scents. ;)

    Jerry Mulligan (Gene Kelly) is a struggling American painter who quit his job in the army to pursue his passion in the sizzling Paris. His good friend includes Adam Cook (Oscar Levant) an unknown pianist who lives in an apartment nearby. Adam introduces Jerry to Henri Baurel (Georges Guetary) a popular local crooner, who is to marry a 'vivacious, modern, enchanting, fascinating, exciting, sweet, shy and scholarly' dancer Lise ( Jerry does not know about this, however). Jerry puts his landscape paintings on display along the brick walls in the streets of Paris, and makes a paltry living out of it. His character is somewhat nasty, but many struggling street artists whom I have met are actually nasty with their take-it-or-leave attitude. He meets Milo (Nina Foch) a middle-aged rich woman who takes fancy to his paintings and agrees to buy two of his works. However, it can be observed here how Milo is actually trying to woo Jerry, as she tells Jerry that she does not have enough money and invites him to her hotel room. Madonna of the 50s, I say! Jerry does not respond well to her advances and starts flirting unabashedly with a young girl at the pub aka Lise. Jerry gets her number and almost prowls her to fall in love with him, which she eventually does. Conversely, Lise sets out more traps for Jerry. The rest is well. obvious. The Oscar and Golden Globes Associations have infamously awarded lesser deserving films, actors, actresses, supporting actors, supporting actresses, documentaries, music, screenplay. For example, Sandra Bullock's tough white compassionate mother act that paled even in comparison to a similar tough mom act by Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich. Or take the complete failure of recognition of 1952s 'Singin' in The Rain', a definitive musical masterpiece also starring Gene Kelly, and my personal choice for the greatest film of the 20th century. But to see 'An American in Paris' win Best Picture and Best Screenplay (!!!) is an unexpected and somewhat sour surprise. Why? Because An American in Paris is an incomplete film, lacking a thorough script, thin of memorable songs and dance sequences, short of convincing performances and devoid of a proper conclusion. How can this be rewarded the best script when the last twenty minutes did not receive enough momentum from the first ninety minutes, thus making the entire attempt somewhat flat? Gene Kelly's larger-than-life, showy persona proved an advantage in 'SITR' but here, where he has to downplay his character, it militates his likability. Also, his treatment of Jean Hagen's Lena Lamont in SITR was correct because of Lena's demanding diva personality. But to behave in the same way with Milo in AAIP made him a bit of a cad, especially when he drops her like a brick in the end without even considering her feelings for once, that too when he was acting in the same fashion albeit to woo Lise. He also has this slightly putting off habit of acting and moving in an affected way that is paradoxical to his role. Watch the first scene where he gets up fully aware that there is a camera in front of him, and then performs various movements in a rehearsed fashion. Works well at times, especially during the sing and dance numbers but lacks trueness otherwise. Hard to blame him though, since many actors 'act' this way. Leslie Caron does not live up to all the qualities mentioned about her by Henri. She seems shy, somewhat traditional and even reticent, like Talia Shire's character in Rocky. It is only when she dances that there comes some personality in her. But she still does not have the desired screen presence during the numbers, and cannot stand out when performing in a group. Also her chemistry with Gene is often bland and one-sided; Gene at least manages to show some fondness towards her while Leslie looks as if she is just playing along with him. Henri can sing well and act charmingly, but his character too is poorly given the chauffeur/dad-who-opposes-then-concedes treatment. They could have had some dialog between Henri and Lise, since love can't be so easily given up. And don't get me started on the ridiculous superhero-like costumes both Gene and Henri were wearing in the otherwise serious scene before the final performance! Oscar Levant was utterly wasted; he had a promising back-story or whatever you call it. They could have especially done more after his daydreaming concert act to draw attention upon his unfulfilled desires of becoming famous before the party scene. Oscar Levant, like many other actors, just parrots his lines without adding any gravity to it. Nina Foch was the only actor truly worth mentioning here; she conveys her dry charm, furtiveness and ultimately disappointment well. All of the songs are melodious but not catchy. However, they have the French charm that gives fervor to the movie. Even 'My Fair Lady' had fabulous numbers but I cannot remember any; it is because unlike Singing in the Rain or Marry Poppins or Sound of Music, they don't carry indelible hooks. So it isn't a fault, just a lacking. But the fault was to place all these numbers in this film; they failed to add up and boost the finale. Conversely, SITR placed its numbers so well that the 12 minute Broadway Melody spectacle at the end was just dazzling. I have to commend the unique filming techniques in the film: Lise could not be described more wonderfully, the one-man band was clever and the theatrical finishing was ingenious. The performances, especially the one between Kelly and Guetary brought a smile to my face. But the movie itself disappointed me; it seems like a beta version when compared to Singing in the Rain, but as a standalone, it was underwhelming. My Rating: 5.5 out of 10

    Take an accomplished director, one of the world's most famous dancers, a dreamily romantic setting and music from none other than George Gershwin and what do you have? In the case of An American in Paris, you have a film which, for me, falls flat on its face. The winning combination of talent and reputation thrilled the critics, back in 1951 and the film was showered with awards including six Oscars. But, looked at coldly and in retrospect, it's difficult to understand why . Right from the opening scene, when Gene Kelly  who is supposed to be starving in a Paris garret  wakes up looking prosperous, over-confident and heavily made-up, you can already hear the turkey feathers starting to rustle. The story falters and bumbles its way through yawning intervals which separate the big numbers and the characters become less convincing with every scene. Leslie Caron, when she finally turns up, looks terrified and toothy and though she dances superbly, seems too timid to bring magic to any of her scenes. She and Kelly dance pretty well together, technically, but without the slightest sense of partnership. Watching them, I got the impression that each would rather have been somewhere else. The music, despite such great numbers, seems to have been shoe-horned into the narrative and often, doesn't fit. The scene where Gershwin's rattlingly wonderful Concerto in F is performed, for instance, has nothing to do with anything else in the film. It does, however, provide moments of sweet relief from the limping story and embarrassingly stilted scenes. It's hard to believe that Oklahoma was released only four years later, in 1955 and yet, seems to belong to a different era. Oklahoma succeeds in every respect where An American in Paris fails. The acting is convincing, the story works well, the casting is faultless, the choreography - apart from the disappointing dream sequence - is sublime. But above all, the characters in Oklahoma perform with zest and sparkle in overdrive. That makes the film overflow with a sense of freshness, excitement and overflowing 'joy de vivre'. What a difference!

    After service in World War II, singer-dancer and struggling painter Gene Kelly (as Jerry Mulligan) settles on the Left Bank of Paris. His handsome features attract heiress Nina Foch (as Milo Roberts) and Mr. Kelly quickly becomes her escort. While out nightclubbing with his sponsor, Kelly sets he his sights on pretty young Leslie Caron (as Lise Bouvier). However, she is seeing local entertainer Georges Guetary (as Henri Baurel). Another American in Paris, pianist Oscar Levant (as Adam Cook), connects the lovers. Outstanding singing, dancing, impressions and setting in a too long and flimsy story; the art remains. ******** An American in Paris (8/26/51) Vincente Minnelli ~ Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant, Georges Guetary

    Fans of the movie genres known as "Musical", "Classic", and "Romance" and pure true lovers, lend me your ear. If you looking for the perfect romance musical, then the Oscar-winning "An American in Paris" is really the right movie for you. From the first minute, you, fellow viewer and reader, has been transformed into a cinematic world of lavishing color, enchanting magic and endless delights. After the end, even the whole movie stays with you for long as you can remember. This is the story of Jerry Mulligan {Gene Kelly}, a former American GI living in Paris making paintings and making friends with pianist Adam Cook {Oscar Levant} and singer Henri Baurel {Georges Guetary}. He soon finds love in the form of Lise Bouvier {Leslie Caron}, but soon romantic problems develop and Lise is not sure of what to do with her future with Jerry. This is one of the most delicious and most shining musicals around, and the superb score and choreography shows why this film feels not really dated. George and Ira Gershwin has mastered a genius of a lovely score right here, filled with so much many hummable songs such as "I Got Rhythm", "Our Love is Here to Stay", "Stairway to Paradise" and so much more. This is really and truly better than most of the music we have today. The choreography by Kelly is and truly a revelation. The most memorable of these, the ballet in the end, is one of the most ingenious and wondrous musical numbers we have ever seen in the history of the American musical. Kelly gives an everyday guy persona to Jerry. Once he becomes a character, we stay with him that way. The way he acts, the way he really dances, the way he sings, he really is a different type of a character. Caron really delivers in her first film role as Lise. She gives a lighting spark of radiance and power to the character. The moments that Kelly and Caron are together, the heart of romance goes aflutter and the viewer suddenly has gone love struck, rooting for them all the way. Even the supporting cast is feeling the magic as we speak. Levant is very funny and sensational. He delivers the film's comic moment when he conducts his own orchestra performing his own piece in a hilarious dream. Guetary is all dapper and gay. He is truly a wonder performing "Stairway to Paradise". Nina Foch also delivers as Jerry's society friend, Milo. She delivers one of the film's best one liners when waiting for a date with Jerry and another girl, Jerry asks "Who is the other girl?" Milo says "Me." Vincente Minnelli delivers a fantastic film here. Alan Jay Lerner's script is nothing short of delightful. The costumes and the sets by Orry-Kelly, Preston Kelly and Cedric Gibbons, respectively, are full of splendor and life. This is really a magnificent and can't miss film to watch not just by yourself, but for the whole entire family, even your pet. Rarely has a musical felt so much lovely and perfectly as this.

    The story is surprisingly intense and actually eclipses the dancing sequences which are impressive. As much as the movies's plot may seem hokey and contrived, it really isn't. The story is plausible; people can fall in love immediately and get swept up in their emotions. Gene Kelly gives a great performance as an expatriate American and Leslie Caron proves to be dynamic in her role. The final dance sequence is incredible, combining several different dance forms. What makes this movie even stronger is that the story is simple, the characters likable and the music outstanding. The dream sequence with Oscar Levant was brilliant. There is nothing wrong with an upbeat movie featuring wonderfully talented actors who actually entertain. They sing, they dance, there is music and a happy ending. What's wrong with that? Nothing. This movie deserved the honors it received. Street Car and A Place in the Sun were marvelous movies, but a quality musical will trump a bleak, black-and-white drama anytime, like it did in 1951. Who would an audience rather watch: Gene Kelly laughing and dancing with Leslie Caron to the music of George Gershwin or gloomy Montgomery Clift plotting to kill a hapless Shelly Winters?

    I'e been a huge fan of "Singin' in the Rain" for quite some time now. I loved the songs, costumes, story, and actors in that one. I had heard of AAIP for a while, too. I've heard it was spectacular and decided to give it a whirl. It's not the worst I've ever seen, oh no. But definitely one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. First of all, Gene Kelly wasn't my favorite in SITR (I prefer Donald O'Connor). But I still thought he was alright. But he wasn't nearly as good in AAIP. His singing is okay here and there. But he doesn't do anything that makes me stare with wide eyes. I've always thought he was overrated. Not bad. But definitely overrated. And I didn't like his character much in this one, either. Also, his chemistry with Leslie Caron is not very believable, in my opinion. Speaking of Leslie, this was her first film. So I understand how she might be uncomfortable. But, am I the only one who doesn't think she's that pretty in this one? I thought she was fabulous in "Gigi" (1958). She was gorgeous and very talented in that one. But this one, she was missing something. But it was fun to watch her dance on pointe. Kelly's pal, Oscar Levant, is supposed to be the comic relief. Well, he wasn't at all comical, or at all a relief, for that matter. I loved his piano playing and I hope to be as good as him someday. But he was about as humorous as a brick and not a good actor, either. If you want a real good Gene Kelly pal, watch Donald O'Connor in SITR. He's actually funny and talented in many ways. So, I only gave this a 5 because of Levant's piano playing (which was magnificent), Kelly's "I Got Rhythmn" number with the little kids (but I do still prefer Judy Garland's version of the song), and the ballet at the end. As much as I love SITR, it's ballet was not as exciting. I did like the ballet in AAIP very much. So, all in all, it's a so-so movie. If you like that sort of thing, go ahead and watch it. But I'm warning you. You'd be much better off with watching "Singin' in the Rain".

    Movie musicals aren't my strong suit, but most of the time when I see one it manages to be entertaining enough. Gene Kelly has a way of making all of his dance moves seem effortlessly easy, and watching Leslie Caron keep in step with him is one of the highlights of the film. I wasn't too crazy about the romantic entanglements in the story, as Jerry Mulligan (Kelly) seemed better suited to end up with his sponsor Milo Roberts (Nina Foch); while Caron's character didn't seem to be a match for either Jerry or her fianc&eacute;e. I never could quite understand how a jilted lover, in this case Henri (Georges Guetary), manages to be so gallant in the end when his girlfriend goes off with another man. The main attraction here is the song and dance. Kelly is fun to watch in every one of his numbers, and the sequence featuring his pianist buddy Adam (Oscar Levant) was fairly innovative and entertaining. I got a kick out of the way Levant reacted to Henri's counsel for Jerry in matters of love and romance. Even though the picture relied heavily on extravagant use of color, it was interesting to see the gala black and white Mardi Gras style party in costumed splendor. As befitting the title of the picture, a couple more of the lavish dance sequences relied heavily on red, white and blue, an appropriate statement considering Kelly's character an ex-GI. This film made AFI's original Top 100 Movies of all time in 1997, but dropped off a decade later when the listing was revised in 2007. Considering it's competition for the Best Picture Oscar in 1952, namely "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun", it's curious to me how this one would have taken top honors, but I've stopped fretting about these things a long time ago. For my money, I'll take Kelly's follow up a year later, "Singin' in the Rain", but if you're a fan of movie musicals, there's enough entertainment value in both to keep one satisfied.

    Jerry Mulligan is a struggling American artist in Paris, he gets coveted by a rich heiress who can help his struggling career. However, a visit to a night club and a meeting with a delicate young, but spoken for, French girl, leads him into a battle with himself. Winner of seven Academy Awards, An American In Paris is of course a delightful and breezy picture from the MGM vault. Said to be the personal favourite movie of Gene Kelly, it boasts wonderful tunes from George & Ira Gershwin, brilliant art direction from Cedric Gibbons, vivid Technicolor that fills the eyes, and quite stunning choreography from Gene Kelly. The film, all told, is high on production value and entertaining enough from start to finish. Yet the film's plot is showing definite age problems now, and it also lacks the ode to joy sense of purpose that, for example, Singing In The Rain has. I also feel it's a missed opportunity to actually film the picture entirely on location in Paris instead of on the MGM lot, because a bit of earthy core feels missing from the unfolding story. Leslie Caron as the love rival to the smokingly hot older woman played by Nina Foch, is majestic dance wise, but acting she's very staid, and this too is an irritation. However, I still adore this film very much, just not as much as Gene and the Academy did, apparently! Come the grand finale it's hard to be too critical when so much energy and deftness of feet has been constructed for our entertainment. With such a production it's suffice to say that now, with all the technological advances made in home entertainment, An American in Paris is an High Definition essential. 7/10

    This is a film, I've found, about which nobody can ever be persuaded. It's too much an example of its various genres (musical, dance-fest, inevitable romance, exotic setting) to ever transcend them. That locks one's reaction to this undeniable classic of the studio system  "Made in Hollywood, U.S.A.," indeed  into whether one likes those genres. If you love any or all of George (and Ira) Gershwin's work, intricate choreography, ballet taken to literally Impressionistic heights, Paris long-shots (yes, the second unit did go there, it wasn't all done in Culver City), and happy endings, you'll dote on this film. If you can't stand plots that mainly tie musical performances together, actors who are chosen for dance or singing talent more than thespian skills, or back-lot artifice (yes, the brilliant 17-minute ballet at the end is the ultimate example), you won't see it twice. That makes one smoothly written appraisal difficult. It's full of elements popping up from each genre. It's the studio system at its most and least successful. (Not "worst." Nothing with the Gershwins' work can EVER be a "worst.") So I'll jump in to defend several elements against some strong criticisms. Some of this depends on remembering the elephant on those "Parisian" streets: There'd been a war on. ~ Gene Kelly (Jerry Mulligan): He's frequently derided as too old, either in absolute terms or relative to the rest of the cast. Not at all! Exuberant skill undercuts his physical age by at least 15 years here. It also makes Jerry's pursuit of Lise far more plausible. I'm sorry, but it's just not "stalking," then or now. It's elegantly converted from machismo, the kind that many women have complained about when seeing it ... and even more when they don't see it. Nor is Kelly so overambitious as to fit uncomfortably in a penniless-painter role, as some have said. It's too easy to forget that Jerry's been in Paris since the Second World War ended. That tore spirits or bodies apart for nearly all the Americans who fought in it, sooner or later, partly from most being forced into a crusader role they didn't want. This G.I. could need a few years to reawaken his capacity for talented work and fervent love. ~ Leslie Caron (Lise): She didn't show earnest or assertive acting until "Gigi," true enough. She was a brilliant dancing partner for Kelly, and not much more. (Those eyes and that smile, though, were to die for even at that age.) Yet consider Lise's back story, such as it is  losing her parents, Resistance fighters, before adolescence, and growing up with mentors instead. Wouldn't that have made her less confident about what the world would bring to her? She, as well as Mulligan, blossoms slowly after a dry spell. ~ Georges Gu&eacute;tary (Henri): He's the grounded contrast to Jerry's shallower-rooted American. His confidence and resilience aren't at all overblown. He's had a performing career and he's sticking to making the most of it, which will include Lise if it can, but will ultimately go on without her if it must. This boulevardier has a quiet persistence that isn't immediately evident. ~ Oscar Levant (Adam): No, he is not at all superfluous to the story, nor to the romantic entanglements. Just look at the scene in the caf&eacute; where he's sitting between Henri and Jerry, and only he knows that the others love the same girl. His frantic reactions, when the men unknowingly talk about the same object of affection, show priceless comic timing and subtly discharge any over-emotion. Levant was a brilliant pianist, and this friend of the composer had to have a Gershwin showcase. (The last movement of the "Concerto in F," where he's imagining himself also as orchestra, conductor, and audience.) Yet he's not a survivor, as Jerry and Lise are, and he's not above it all, as Henri is. He has unfulfilled ambition and imagination, yet stays involved enough in life to appreciate enthusiasm and stay connected to friends. His deflation of Jerry's sponsor at the end is not just a bon mot, but an act of loyalty. ~ Nina Foch (Milo): Okay, she's a bit too young and beautiful to be entirely convincing as Jerry's older patron. Yet she has the most acting skills of any of the main characters, and she takes a thankless position in the story and makes it both dignified and funny. Her possessiveness about Jerry is understandable and is offset by considerable good humor and charm. She has ambitions, romantic and otherwise, but she's not insincere about them, as out-sized as they may be. Milo's rising interest and final withdrawal are both quietly skilled and acted out in a minimum of screen time. ~ The plot: Yes, it mainly ties the music together and compresses events to make room. Yes, at times it makes Jerry too persistent, Adam too acerbic, Milo too grasping, Lise too unquestioning, Henri too accepting. Yet it remains remarkable for making so many genres work together at all! Alan Jay Lerner knew it was just functional (Oscar notwithstanding). It was meant to turn an artistic salad, with Gershwin lettuce, into a tasty meal for the viewer, and it more than succeeded in doing so. ... So is this, even for a lover of the Gershwins' music, anywhere near perfect? It comes very close. The plot more than exceeds the burdens put upon it, but it still has little resonance, so I take away one star. Yet the actors rise to their situations and show their strengths beautifully. It really comes down to one truth, as a lyric says: "Our love is here to stay." Not necessarily for the studio confectionery, or the mannered acting, or the utility plot. But for the incomparable Gershwins, and for what could be so ably strung upon their brilliance.

    I watched this movie 59 years after it was released (God bless technology) and what struck me most was the difference in the culture. The love connection that drives the story is created when he literally stalks her until she laughingly concedes after which point, their love is assumed as a given. And for the "other guy" to deliver his cheating fianc&eacute;e to him at the end of the movie WITH A SMILE(!!??!!) is so far beyond ridiculous, I'm not even sure I saw it right. There were other instances but I think I've made my point. I don't think the story was intended to be the real draw here. At least I hope not. The music and dancing were so good (Gene Kelly has more charm and charisma in any single scene than most Hollywood studios can dream of cramming into their products these days), that despite the story line and the relationships portrayed being mind-boggling, the movie is fun and engaging. What motivated the characters to make some of the decisions they made is simply beyond me but I guess it was just a different time with different social norms and since the real selling points of the movie (the Gershwins music and Gene Kelly's screen presence) needed the plot to go a certain way in order to do their thing, it just did and all told, that's fine with me. If it wasn't for Gene Kelly and the Gershwins, this movie would have been a non-starter but with their immeasurable talent, it is a movie worth watching. Leslie Caron as a leading lady was an epic fail but I'm sure a lot of the blame for that lies in the story itself. It cannot be easy to play a lady who switches from angrily saying "You are downright annoying!" to giggling and agreeing to meet for a date a split second later because he refused to take no for an answer. But that's just my two scents. ;)

    Jerry Mulligan (Gene Kelly) is a struggling American painter who quit his job in the army to pursue his passion in the sizzling Paris. His good friend includes Adam Cook (Oscar Levant) an unknown pianist who lives in an apartment nearby. Adam introduces Jerry to Henri Baurel (Georges Guetary) a popular local crooner, who is to marry a 'vivacious, modern, enchanting, fascinating, exciting, sweet, shy and scholarly' dancer Lise ( Jerry does not know about this, however). Jerry puts his landscape paintings on display along the brick walls in the streets of Paris, and makes a paltry living out of it. His character is somewhat nasty, but many struggling street artists whom I have met are actually nasty with their take-it-or-leave attitude. He meets Milo (Nina Foch) a middle-aged rich woman who takes fancy to his paintings and agrees to buy two of his works. However, it can be observed here how Milo is actually trying to woo Jerry, as she tells Jerry that she does not have enough money and invites him to her hotel room. Madonna of the 50s, I say! Jerry does not respond well to her advances and starts flirting unabashedly with a young girl at the pub aka Lise. Jerry gets her number and almost prowls her to fall in love with him, which she eventually does. Conversely, Lise sets out more traps for Jerry. The rest is well. obvious. The Oscar and Golden Globes Associations have infamously awarded lesser deserving films, actors, actresses, supporting actors, supporting actresses, documentaries, music, screenplay. For example, Sandra Bullock's tough white compassionate mother act that paled even in comparison to a similar tough mom act by Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich. Or take the complete failure of recognition of 1952s 'Singin' in The Rain', a definitive musical masterpiece also starring Gene Kelly, and my personal choice for the greatest film of the 20th century. But to see 'An American in Paris' win Best Picture and Best Screenplay (!!!) is an unexpected and somewhat sour surprise. Why? Because An American in Paris is an incomplete film, lacking a thorough script, thin of memorable songs and dance sequences, short of convincing performances and devoid of a proper conclusion. How can this be rewarded the best script when the last twenty minutes did not receive enough momentum from the first ninety minutes, thus making the entire attempt somewhat flat? Gene Kelly's larger-than-life, showy persona proved an advantage in 'SITR' but here, where he has to downplay his character, it militates his likability. Also, his treatment of Jean Hagen's Lena Lamont in SITR was correct because of Lena's demanding diva personality. But to behave in the same way with Milo in AAIP made him a bit of a cad, especially when he drops her like a brick in the end without even considering her feelings for once, that too when he was acting in the same fashion albeit to woo Lise. He also has this slightly putting off habit of acting and moving in an affected way that is paradoxical to his role. Watch the first scene where he gets up fully aware that there is a camera in front of him, and then performs various movements in a rehearsed fashion. Works well at times, especially during the sing and dance numbers but lacks trueness otherwise. Hard to blame him though, since many actors 'act' this way. Leslie Caron does not live up to all the qualities mentioned about her by Henri. She seems shy, somewhat traditional and even reticent, like Talia Shire's character in Rocky. It is only when she dances that there comes some personality in her. But she still does not have the desired screen presence during the numbers, and cannot stand out when performing in a group. Also her chemistry with Gene is often bland and one-sided; Gene at least manages to show some fondness towards her while Leslie looks as if she is just playing along with him. Henri can sing well and act charmingly, but his character too is poorly given the chauffeur/dad-who-opposes-then-concedes treatment. They could have had some dialog between Henri and Lise, since love can't be so easily given up. And don't get me started on the ridiculous superhero-like costumes both Gene and Henri were wearing in the otherwise serious scene before the final performance! Oscar Levant was utterly wasted; he had a promising back-story or whatever you call it. They could have especially done more after his daydreaming concert act to draw attention upon his unfulfilled desires of becoming famous before the party scene. Oscar Levant, like many other actors, just parrots his lines without adding any gravity to it. Nina Foch was the only actor truly worth mentioning here; she conveys her dry charm, furtiveness and ultimately disappointment well. All of the songs are melodious but not catchy. However, they have the French charm that gives fervor to the movie. Even 'My Fair Lady' had fabulous numbers but I cannot remember any; it is because unlike Singing in the Rain or Marry Poppins or Sound of Music, they don't carry indelible hooks. So it isn't a fault, just a lacking. But the fault was to place all these numbers in this film; they failed to add up and boost the finale. Conversely, SITR placed its numbers so well that the 12 minute Broadway Melody spectacle at the end was just dazzling. I have to commend the unique filming techniques in the film: Lise could not be described more wonderfully, the one-man band was clever and the theatrical finishing was ingenious. The performances, especially the one between Kelly and Guetary brought a smile to my face. But the movie itself disappointed me; it seems like a beta version when compared to Singing in the Rain, but as a standalone, it was underwhelming. My Rating: 5.5 out of 10

    Take an accomplished director, one of the world's most famous dancers, a dreamily romantic setting and music from none other than George Gershwin and what do you have? In the case of An American in Paris, you have a film which, for me, falls flat on its face. The winning combination of talent and reputation thrilled the critics, back in 1951 and the film was showered with awards including six Oscars. But, looked at coldly and in retrospect, it's difficult to understand why . Right from the opening scene, when Gene Kelly  who is supposed to be starving in a Paris garret  wakes up looking prosperous, over-confident and heavily made-up, you can already hear the turkey feathers starting to rustle. The story falters and bumbles its way through yawning intervals which separate the big numbers and the characters become less convincing with every scene. Leslie Caron, when she finally turns up, looks terrified and toothy and though she dances superbly, seems too timid to bring magic to any of her scenes. She and Kelly dance pretty well together, technically, but without the slightest sense of partnership. Watching them, I got the impression that each would rather have been somewhere else. The music, despite such great numbers, seems to have been shoe-horned into the narrative and often, doesn't fit. The scene where Gershwin's rattlingly wonderful Concerto in F is performed, for instance, has nothing to do with anything else in the film. It does, however, provide moments of sweet relief from the limping story and embarrassingly stilted scenes. It's hard to believe that Oklahoma was released only four years later, in 1955 and yet, seems to belong to a different era. Oklahoma succeeds in every respect where An American in Paris fails. The acting is convincing, the story works well, the casting is faultless, the choreography - apart from the disappointing dream sequence - is sublime. But above all, the characters in Oklahoma perform with zest and sparkle in overdrive. That makes the film overflow with a sense of freshness, excitement and overflowing 'joy de vivre'. What a difference!

    After service in World War II, singer-dancer and struggling painter Gene Kelly (as Jerry Mulligan) settles on the Left Bank of Paris. His handsome features attract heiress Nina Foch (as Milo Roberts) and Mr. Kelly quickly becomes her escort. While out nightclubbing with his sponsor, Kelly sets he his sights on pretty young Leslie Caron (as Lise Bouvier). However, she is seeing local entertainer Georges Guetary (as Henri Baurel). Another American in Paris, pianist Oscar Levant (as Adam Cook), connects the lovers. Outstanding singing, dancing, impressions and setting in a too long and flimsy story; the art remains. ******** An American in Paris (8/26/51) Vincente Minnelli ~ Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant, Georges Guetary

    Fans of the movie genres known as "Musical", "Classic", and "Romance" and pure true lovers, lend me your ear. If you looking for the perfect romance musical, then the Oscar-winning "An American in Paris" is really the right movie for you. From the first minute, you, fellow viewer and reader, has been transformed into a cinematic world of lavishing color, enchanting magic and endless delights. After the end, even the whole movie stays with you for long as you can remember. This is the story of Jerry Mulligan {Gene Kelly}, a former American GI living in Paris making paintings and making friends with pianist Adam Cook {Oscar Levant} and singer Henri Baurel {Georges Guetary}. He soon finds love in the form of Lise Bouvier {Leslie Caron}, but soon romantic problems develop and Lise is not sure of what to do with her future with Jerry. This is one of the most delicious and most shining musicals around, and the superb score and choreography shows why this film feels not really dated. George and Ira Gershwin has mastered a genius of a lovely score right here, filled with so much many hummable songs such as "I Got Rhythm", "Our Love is Here to Stay", "Stairway to Paradise" and so much more. This is really and truly better than most of the music we have today. The choreography by Kelly is and truly a revelation. The most memorable of these, the ballet in the end, is one of the most ingenious and wondrous musical numbers we have ever seen in the history of the American musical. Kelly gives an everyday guy persona to Jerry. Once he becomes a character, we stay with him that way. The way he acts, the way he really dances, the way he sings, he really is a different type of a character. Caron really delivers in her first film role as Lise. She gives a lighting spark of radiance and power to the character. The moments that Kelly and Caron are together, the heart of romance goes aflutter and the viewer suddenly has gone love struck, rooting for them all the way. Even the supporting cast is feeling the magic as we speak. Levant is very funny and sensational. He delivers the film's comic moment when he conducts his own orchestra performing his own piece in a hilarious dream. Guetary is all dapper and gay. He is truly a wonder performing "Stairway to Paradise". Nina Foch also delivers as Jerry's society friend, Milo. She delivers one of the film's best one liners when waiting for a date with Jerry and another girl, Jerry asks "Who is the other girl?" Milo says "Me." Vincente Minnelli delivers a fantastic film here. Alan Jay Lerner's script is nothing short of delightful. The costumes and the sets by Orry-Kelly, Preston Kelly and Cedric Gibbons, respectively, are full of splendor and life. This is really a magnificent and can't miss film to watch not just by yourself, but for the whole entire family, even your pet. Rarely has a musical felt so much lovely and perfectly as this.

    The story is surprisingly intense and actually eclipses the dancing sequences which are impressive. As much as the movies's plot may seem hokey and contrived, it really isn't. The story is plausible; people can fall in love immediately and get swept up in their emotions. Gene Kelly gives a great performance as an expatriate American and Leslie Caron proves to be dynamic in her role. The final dance sequence is incredible, combining several different dance forms. What makes this movie even stronger is that the story is simple, the characters likable and the music outstanding. The dream sequence with Oscar Levant was brilliant. There is nothing wrong with an upbeat movie featuring wonderfully talented actors who actually entertain. They sing, they dance, there is music and a happy ending. What's wrong with that? Nothing. This movie deserved the honors it received. Street Car and A Place in the Sun were marvelous movies, but a quality musical will trump a bleak, black-and-white drama anytime, like it did in 1951. Who would an audience rather watch: Gene Kelly laughing and dancing with Leslie Caron to the music of George Gershwin or gloomy Montgomery Clift plotting to kill a hapless Shelly Winters?

    I'e been a huge fan of "Singin' in the Rain" for quite some time now. I loved the songs, costumes, story, and actors in that one. I had heard of AAIP for a while, too. I've heard it was spectacular and decided to give it a whirl. It's not the worst I've ever seen, oh no. But definitely one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. First of all, Gene Kelly wasn't my favorite in SITR (I prefer Donald O'Connor). But I still thought he was alright. But he wasn't nearly as good in AAIP. His singing is okay here and there. But he doesn't do anything that makes me stare with wide eyes. I've always thought he was overrated. Not bad. But definitely overrated. And I didn't like his character much in this one, either. Also, his chemistry with Leslie Caron is not very believable, in my opinion. Speaking of Leslie, this was her first film. So I understand how she might be uncomfortable. But, am I the only one who doesn't think she's that pretty in this one? I thought she was fabulous in "Gigi" (1958). She was gorgeous and very talented in that one. But this one, she was missing something. But it was fun to watch her dance on pointe. Kelly's pal, Oscar Levant, is supposed to be the comic relief. Well, he wasn't at all comical, or at all a relief, for that matter. I loved his piano playing and I hope to be as good as him someday. But he was about as humorous as a brick and not a good actor, either. If you want a real good Gene Kelly pal, watch Donald O'Connor in SITR. He's actually funny and talented in many ways. So, I only gave this a 5 because of Levant's piano playing (which was magnificent), Kelly's "I Got Rhythmn" number with the little kids (but I do still prefer Judy Garland's version of the song), and the ballet at the end. As much as I love SITR, it's ballet was not as exciting. I did like the ballet in AAIP very much. So, all in all, it's a so-so movie. If you like that sort of thing, go ahead and watch it. But I'm warning you. You'd be much better off with watching "Singin' in the Rain".

    Movie musicals aren't my strong suit, but most of the time when I see one it manages to be entertaining enough. Gene Kelly has a way of making all of his dance moves seem effortlessly easy, and watching Leslie Caron keep in step with him is one of the highlights of the film. I wasn't too crazy about the romantic entanglements in the story, as Jerry Mulligan (Kelly) seemed better suited to end up with his sponsor Milo Roberts (Nina Foch); while Caron's character didn't seem to be a match for either Jerry or her fianc&eacute;e. I never could quite understand how a jilted lover, in this case Henri (Georges Guetary), manages to be so gallant in the end when his girlfriend goes off with another man. The main attraction here is the song and dance. Kelly is fun to watch in every one of his numbers, and the sequence featuring his pianist buddy Adam (Oscar Levant) was fairly innovative and entertaining. I got a kick out of the way Levant reacted to Henri's counsel for Jerry in matters of love and romance. Even though the picture relied heavily on extravagant use of color, it was interesting to see the gala black and white Mardi Gras style party in costumed splendor. As befitting the title of the picture, a couple more of the lavish dance sequences relied heavily on red, white and blue, an appropriate statement considering Kelly's character an ex-GI. This film made AFI's original Top 100 Movies of all time in 1997, but dropped off a decade later when the listing was revised in 2007. Considering it's competition for the Best Picture Oscar in 1952, namely "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun", it's curious to me how this one would have taken top honors, but I've stopped fretting about these things a long time ago. For my money, I'll take Kelly's follow up a year later, "Singin' in the Rain", but if you're a fan of movie musicals, there's enough entertainment value in both to keep one satisfied.

    Jerry Mulligan is a struggling American artist in Paris, he gets coveted by a rich heiress who can help his struggling career. However, a visit to a night club and a meeting with a delicate young, but spoken for, French girl, leads him into a battle with himself. Winner of seven Academy Awards, An American In Paris is of course a delightful and breezy picture from the MGM vault. Said to be the personal favourite movie of Gene Kelly, it boasts wonderful tunes from George & Ira Gershwin, brilliant art direction from Cedric Gibbons, vivid Technicolor that fills the eyes, and quite stunning choreography from Gene Kelly. The film, all told, is high on production value and entertaining enough from start to finish. Yet the film's plot is showing definite age problems now, and it also lacks the ode to joy sense of purpose that, for example, Singing In The Rain has. I also feel it's a missed opportunity to actually film the picture entirely on location in Paris instead of on the MGM lot, because a bit of earthy core feels missing from the unfolding story. Leslie Caron as the love rival to the smokingly hot older woman played by Nina Foch, is majestic dance wise, but acting she's very staid, and this too is an irritation. However, I still adore this film very much, just not as much as Gene and the Academy did, apparently! Come the grand finale it's hard to be too critical when so much energy and deftness of feet has been constructed for our entertainment. With such a production it's suffice to say that now, with all the technological advances made in home entertainment, An American in Paris is an High Definition essential. 7/10

    This is a film, I've found, about which nobody can ever be persuaded. It's too much an example of its various genres (musical, dance-fest, inevitable romance, exotic setting) to ever transcend them. That locks one's reaction to this undeniable classic of the studio system  "Made in Hollywood, U.S.A.," indeed  into whether one likes those genres. If you love any or all of George (and Ira) Gershwin's work, intricate choreography, ballet taken to literally Impressionistic heights, Paris long-shots (yes, the second unit did go there, it wasn't all done in Culver City), and happy endings, you'll dote on this film. If you can't stand plots that mainly tie musical performances together, actors who are chosen for dance or singing talent more than thespian skills, or back-lot artifice (yes, the brilliant 17-minute ballet at the end is the ultimate example), you won't see it twice. That makes one smoothly written appraisal difficult. It's full of elements popping up from each genre. It's the studio system at its most and least successful. (Not "worst." Nothing with the Gershwins' work can EVER be a "worst.") So I'll jump in to defend several elements against some strong criticisms. Some of this depends on remembering the elephant on those "Parisian" streets: There'd been a war on. ~ Gene Kelly (Jerry Mulligan): He's frequently derided as too old, either in absolute terms or relative to the rest of the cast. Not at all! Exuberant skill undercuts his physical age by at least 15 years here. It also makes Jerry's pursuit of Lise far more plausible. I'm sorry, but it's just not "stalking," then or now. It's elegantly converted from machismo, the kind that many women have complained about when seeing it ... and even more when they don't see it. Nor is Kelly so overambitious as to fit uncomfortably in a penniless-painter role, as some have said. It's too easy to forget that Jerry's been in Paris since the Second World War ended. That tore spirits or bodies apart for nearly all the Americans who fought in it, sooner or later, partly from most being forced into a crusader role they didn't want. This G.I. could need a few years to reawaken his capacity for talented work and fervent love. ~ Leslie Caron (Lise): She didn't show earnest or assertive acting until "Gigi," true enough. She was a brilliant dancing partner for Kelly, and not much more. (Those eyes and that smile, though, were to die for even at that age.) Yet consider Lise's back story, such as it is  losing her parents, Resistance fighters, before adolescence, and growing up with mentors instead. Wouldn't that have made her less confident about what the world would bring to her? She, as well as Mulligan, blossoms slowly after a dry spell. ~ Georges Gu&eacute;tary (Henri): He's the grounded contrast to Jerry's shallower-rooted American. His confidence and resilience aren't at all overblown. He's had a performing career and he's sticking to making the most of it, which will include Lise if it can, but will ultimately go on without her if it must. This boulevardier has a quiet persistence that isn't immediately evident. ~ Oscar Levant (Adam): No, he is not at all superfluous to the story, nor to the romantic entanglements. Just look at the scene in the caf&eacute; where he's sitting between Henri and Jerry, and only he knows that the others love the same girl. His frantic reactions, when the men unknowingly talk about the same object of affection, show priceless comic timing and subtly discharge any over-emotion. Levant was a brilliant pianist, and this friend of the composer had to have a Gershwin showcase. (The last movement of the "Concerto in F," where he's imagining himself also as orchestra, conductor, and audience.) Yet he's not a survivor, as Jerry and Lise are, and he's not above it all, as Henri is. He has unfulfilled ambition and imagination, yet stays involved enough in life to appreciate enthusiasm and stay connected to friends. His deflation of Jerry's sponsor at the end is not just a bon mot, but an act of loyalty. ~ Nina Foch (Milo): Okay, she's a bit too young and beautiful to be entirely convincing as Jerry's older patron. Yet she has the most acting skills of any of the main characters, and she takes a thankless position in the story and makes it both dignified and funny. Her possessiveness about Jerry is understandable and is offset by considerable good humor and charm. She has ambitions, romantic and otherwise, but she's not insincere about them, as out-sized as they may be. Milo's rising interest and final withdrawal are both quietly skilled and acted out in a minimum of screen time. ~ The plot: Yes, it mainly ties the music together and compresses events to make room. Yes, at times it makes Jerry too persistent, Adam too acerbic, Milo too grasping, Lise too unquestioning, Henri too accepting. Yet it remains remarkable for making so many genres work together at all! Alan Jay Lerner knew it was just functional (Oscar notwithstanding). It was meant to turn an artistic salad, with Gershwin lettuce, into a tasty meal for the viewer, and it more than succeeded in doing so. ... So is this, even for a lover of the Gershwins' music, anywhere near perfect? It comes very close. The plot more than exceeds the burdens put upon it, but it still has little resonance, so I take away one star. Yet the actors rise to their situations and show their strengths beautifully. It really comes down to one truth, as a lyric says: "Our love is here to stay." Not necessarily for the studio confectionery, or the mannered acting, or the utility plot. But for the incomparable Gershwins, and for what could be so ably strung upon their brilliance.

    I watched this movie 59 years after it was released (God bless technology) and what struck me most was the difference in the culture. The love connection that drives the story is created when he literally stalks her until she laughingly concedes after which point, their love is assumed as a given. And for the "other guy" to deliver his cheating fianc&eacute;e to him at the end of the movie WITH A SMILE(!!??!!) is so far beyond ridiculous, I'm not even sure I saw it right. There were other instances but I think I've made my point. I don't think the story was intended to be the real draw here. At least I hope not. The music and dancing were so good (Gene Kelly has more charm and charisma in any single scene than most Hollywood studios can dream of cramming into their products these days), that despite the story line and the relationships portrayed being mind-boggling, the movie is fun and engaging. What motivated the characters to make some of the decisions they made is simply beyond me but I guess it was just a different time with different social norms and since the real selling points of the movie (the Gershwins music and Gene Kelly's screen presence) needed the plot to go a certain way in order to do their thing, it just did and all told, that's fine with me. If it wasn't for Gene Kelly and the Gershwins, this movie would have been a non-starter but with their immeasurable talent, it is a movie worth watching. Leslie Caron as a leading lady was an epic fail but I'm sure a lot of the blame for that lies in the story itself. It cannot be easy to play a lady who switches from angrily saying "You are downright annoying!" to giggling and agreeing to meet for a date a split second later because he refused to take no for an answer. But that's just my two scents. ;)

    Jerry Mulligan (Gene Kelly) is a struggling American painter who quit his job in the army to pursue his passion in the sizzling Paris. His good friend includes Adam Cook (Oscar Levant) an unknown pianist who lives in an apartment nearby. Adam introduces Jerry to Henri Baurel (Georges Guetary) a popular local crooner, who is to marry a 'vivacious, modern, enchanting, fascinating, exciting, sweet, shy and scholarly' dancer Lise ( Jerry does not know about this, however). Jerry puts his landscape paintings on display along the brick walls in the streets of Paris, and makes a paltry living out of it. His character is somewhat nasty, but many struggling street artists whom I have met are actually nasty with their take-it-or-leave attitude. He meets Milo (Nina Foch) a middle-aged rich woman who takes fancy to his paintings and agrees to buy two of his works. However, it can be observed here how Milo is actually trying to woo Jerry, as she tells Jerry that she does not have enough money and invites him to her hotel room. Madonna of the 50s, I say! Jerry does not respond well to her advances and starts flirting unabashedly with a young girl at the pub aka Lise. Jerry gets her number and almost prowls her to fall in love with him, which she eventually does. Conversely, Lise sets out more traps for Jerry. The rest is well. obvious. The Oscar and Golden Globes Associations have infamously awarded lesser deserving films, actors, actresses, supporting actors, supporting actresses, documentaries, music, screenplay. For example, Sandra Bullock's tough white compassionate mother act that paled even in comparison to a similar tough mom act by Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich. Or take the complete failure of recognition of 1952s 'Singin' in The Rain', a definitive musical masterpiece also starring Gene Kelly, and my personal choice for the greatest film of the 20th century. But to see 'An American in Paris' win Best Picture and Best Screenplay (!!!) is an unexpected and somewhat sour surprise. Why? Because An American in Paris is an incomplete film, lacking a thorough script, thin of memorable songs and dance sequences, short of convincing performances and devoid of a proper conclusion. How can this be rewarded the best script when the last twenty minutes did not receive enough momentum from the first ninety minutes, thus making the entire attempt somewhat flat? Gene Kelly's larger-than-life, showy persona proved an advantage in 'SITR' but here, where he has to downplay his character, it militates his likability. Also, his treatment of Jean Hagen's Lena Lamont in SITR was correct because of Lena's demanding diva personality. But to behave in the same way with Milo in AAIP made him a bit of a cad, especially when he drops her like a brick in the end without even considering her feelings for once, that too when he was acting in the same fashion albeit to woo Lise. He also has this slightly putting off habit of acting and moving in an affected way that is paradoxical to his role. Watch the first scene where he gets up fully aware that there is a camera in front of him, and then performs various movements in a rehearsed fashion. Works well at times, especially during the sing and dance numbers but lacks trueness otherwise. Hard to blame him though, since many actors 'act' this way. Leslie Caron does not live up to all the qualities mentioned about her by Henri. She seems shy, somewhat traditional and even reticent, like Talia Shire's character in Rocky. It is only when she dances that there comes some personality in her. But she still does not have the desired screen presence during the numbers, and cannot stand out when performing in a group. Also her chemistry with Gene is often bland and one-sided; Gene at least manages to show some fondness towards her while Leslie looks as if she is just playing along with him. Henri can sing well and act charmingly, but his character too is poorly given the chauffeur/dad-who-opposes-then-concedes treatment. They could have had some dialog between Henri and Lise, since love can't be so easily given up. And don't get me started on the ridiculous superhero-like costumes both Gene and Henri were wearing in the otherwise serious scene before the final performance! Oscar Levant was utterly wasted; he had a promising back-story or whatever you call it. They could have especially done more after his daydreaming concert act to draw attention upon his unfulfilled desires of becoming famous before the party scene. Oscar Levant, like many other actors, just parrots his lines without adding any gravity to it. Nina Foch was the only actor truly worth mentioning here; she conveys her dry charm, furtiveness and ultimately disappointment well. All of the songs are melodious but not catchy. However, they have the French charm that gives fervor to the movie. Even 'My Fair Lady' had fabulous numbers but I cannot remember any; it is because unlike Singing in the Rain or Marry Poppins or Sound of Music, they don't carry indelible hooks. So it isn't a fault, just a lacking. But the fault was to place all these numbers in this film; they failed to add up and boost the finale. Conversely, SITR placed its numbers so well that the 12 minute Broadway Melody spectacle at the end was just dazzling. I have to commend the unique filming techniques in the film: Lise could not be described more wonderfully, the one-man band was clever and the theatrical finishing was ingenious. The performances, especially the one between Kelly and Guetary brought a smile to my face. But the movie itself disappointed me; it seems like a beta version when compared to Singing in the Rain, but as a standalone, it was underwhelming. My Rating: 5.5 out of 10

    Take an accomplished director, one of the world's most famous dancers, a dreamily romantic setting and music from none other than George Gershwin and what do you have? In the case of An American in Paris, you have a film which, for me, falls flat on its face. The winning combination of talent and reputation thrilled the critics, back in 1951 and the film was showered with awards including six Oscars. But, looked at coldly and in retrospect, it's difficult to understand why . Right from the opening scene, when Gene Kelly  who is supposed to be starving in a Paris garret  wakes up looking prosperous, over-confident and heavily made-up, you can already hear the turkey feathers starting to rustle. The story falters and bumbles its way through yawning intervals which separate the big numbers and the characters become less convincing with every scene. Leslie Caron, when she finally turns up, looks terrified and toothy and though she dances superbly, seems too timid to bring magic to any of her scenes. She and Kelly dance pretty well together, technically, but without the slightest sense of partnership. Watching them, I got the impression that each would rather have been somewhere else. The music, despite such great numbers, seems to have been shoe-horned into the narrative and often, doesn't fit. The scene where Gershwin's rattlingly wonderful Concerto in F is performed, for instance, has nothing to do with anything else in the film. It does, however, provide moments of sweet relief from the limping story and embarrassingly stilted scenes. It's hard to believe that Oklahoma was released only four years later, in 1955 and yet, seems to belong to a different era. Oklahoma succeeds in every respect where An American in Paris fails. The acting is convincing, the story works well, the casting is faultless, the choreography - apart from the disappointing dream sequence - is sublime. But above all, the characters in Oklahoma perform with zest and sparkle in overdrive. That makes the film overflow with a sense of freshness, excitement and overflowing 'joy de vivre'. What a difference!

    After service in World War II, singer-dancer and struggling painter Gene Kelly (as Jerry Mulligan) settles on the Left Bank of Paris. His handsome features attract heiress Nina Foch (as Milo Roberts) and Mr. Kelly quickly becomes her escort. While out nightclubbing with his sponsor, Kelly sets he his sights on pretty young Leslie Caron (as Lise Bouvier). However, she is seeing local entertainer Georges Guetary (as Henri Baurel). Another American in Paris, pianist Oscar Levant (as Adam Cook), connects the lovers. Outstanding singing, dancing, impressions and setting in a too long and flimsy story; the art remains. ******** An American in Paris (8/26/51) Vincente Minnelli ~ Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant, Georges Guetary

    Fans of the movie genres known as "Musical", "Classic", and "Romance" and pure true lovers, lend me your ear. If you looking for the perfect romance musical, then the Oscar-winning "An American in Paris" is really the right movie for you. From the first minute, you, fellow viewer and reader, has been transformed into a cinematic world of lavishing color, enchanting magic and endless delights. After the end, even the whole movie stays with you for long as you can remember. This is the story of Jerry Mulligan {Gene Kelly}, a former American GI living in Paris making paintings and making friends with pianist Adam Cook {Oscar Levant} and singer Henri Baurel {Georges Guetary}. He soon finds love in the form of Lise Bouvier {Leslie Caron}, but soon romantic problems develop and Lise is not sure of what to do with her future with Jerry. This is one of the most delicious and most shining musicals around, and the superb score and choreography shows why this film feels not really dated. George and Ira Gershwin has mastered a genius of a lovely score right here, filled with so much many hummable songs such as "I Got Rhythm", "Our Love is Here to Stay", "Stairway to Paradise" and so much more. This is really and truly better than most of the music we have today. The choreography by Kelly is and truly a revelation. The most memorable of these, the ballet in the end, is one of the most ingenious and wondrous musical numbers we have ever seen in the history of the American musical. Kelly gives an everyday guy persona to Jerry. Once he becomes a character, we stay with him that way. The way he acts, the way he really dances, the way he sings, he really is a different type of a character. Caron really delivers in her first film role as Lise. She gives a lighting spark of radiance and power to the character. The moments that Kelly and Caron are together, the heart of romance goes aflutter and the viewer suddenly has gone love struck, rooting for them all the way. Even the supporting cast is feeling the magic as we speak. Levant is very funny and sensational. He delivers the film's comic moment when he conducts his own orchestra performing his own piece in a hilarious dream. Guetary is all dapper and gay. He is truly a wonder performing "Stairway to Paradise". Nina Foch also delivers as Jerry's society friend, Milo. She delivers one of the film's best one liners when waiting for a date with Jerry and another girl, Jerry asks "Who is the other girl?" Milo says "Me." Vincente Minnelli delivers a fantastic film here. Alan Jay Lerner's script is nothing short of delightful. The costumes and the sets by Orry-Kelly, Preston Kelly and Cedric Gibbons, respectively, are full of splendor and life. This is really a magnificent and can't miss film to watch not just by yourself, but for the whole entire family, even your pet. Rarely has a musical felt so much lovely and perfectly as this. My Pick: Green Light {See It}

    The story is surprisingly intense and actually eclipses the dancing sequences which are impressive. As much as the movies's plot may seem hokey and contrived, it really isn't. The story is plausible; people can fall in love immediately and get swept up in their emotions. Gene Kelly gives a great performance as an expatriate American and Leslie Caron proves to be dynamic in her role. The final dance sequence is incredible, combining several different dance forms. What makes this movie even stronger is that the story is simple, the characters likable and the music outstanding. The dream sequence with Oscar Levant was brilliant. There is nothing wrong with an upbeat movie featuring wonderfully talented actors who actually entertain. They sing, they dance, there is music and a happy ending. What's wrong with that? Nothing. This movie deserved the honors it received. Street Car and A Place in the Sun were marvelous movies, but a quality musical will trump a bleak, black-and-white drama anytime, like it did in 1951. Who would an audience rather watch: Gene Kelly laughing and dancing with Leslie Caron to the music of George Gershwin or gloomy Montgomery Clift plotting to kill a hapless Shelly Winters?

    I'e been a huge fan of "Singin' in the Rain" for quite some time now. I loved the songs, costumes, story, and actors in that one. I had heard of AAIP for a while, too. I've heard it was spectacular and decided to give it a whirl. It's not the worst I've ever seen, oh no. But definitely one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. First of all, Gene Kelly wasn't my favorite in SITR (I prefer Donald O'Connor). But I still thought he was alright. But he wasn't nearly as good in AAIP. His singing is okay here and there. But he doesn't do anything that makes me stare with wide eyes. I've always thought he was overrated. Not bad. But definitely overrated. And I didn't like his character much in this one, either. Also, his chemistry with Leslie Caron is not very believable, in my opinion. Speaking of Leslie, this was her first film. So I understand how she might be uncomfortable. But, am I the only one who doesn't think she's that pretty in this one? I thought she was fabulous in "Gigi" (1958). She was gorgeous and very talented in that one. But this one, she was missing something. But it was fun to watch her dance on pointe. Kelly's pal, Oscar Levant, is supposed to be the comic relief. Well, he wasn't at all comical, or at all a relief, for that matter. I loved his piano playing and I hope to be as good as him someday. But he was about as humorous as a brick and not a good actor, either. If you want a real good Gene Kelly pal, watch Donald O'Connor in SITR. He's actually funny and talented in many ways. So, I only gave this a 5 because of Levant's piano playing (which was magnificent), Kelly's "I Got Rhythmn" number with the little kids (but I do still prefer Judy Garland's version of the song), and the ballet at the end. As much as I love SITR, it's ballet was not as exciting. I did like the ballet in AAIP very much. So, all in all, it's a so-so movie. If you like that sort of thing, go ahead and watch it. But I'm warning you. You'd be much better off with watching "Singin' in the Rain".

    Movie musicals aren't my strong suit, but most of the time when I see one it manages to be entertaining enough. Gene Kelly has a way of making all of his dance moves seem effortlessly easy, and watching Leslie Caron keep in step with him is one of the highlights of the film. I wasn't too crazy about the romantic entanglements in the story, as Jerry Mulligan (Kelly) seemed better suited to end up with his sponsor Milo Roberts (Nina Foch); while Caron's character didn't seem to be a match for either Jerry or her fianc&eacute;e. I never could quite understand how a jilted lover, in this case Henri (Georges Guetary), manages to be so gallant in the end when his girlfriend goes off with another man. The main attraction here is the song and dance. Kelly is fun to watch in every one of his numbers, and the sequence featuring his pianist buddy Adam (Oscar Levant) was fairly innovative and entertaining. I got a kick out of the way Levant reacted to Henri's counsel for Jerry in matters of love and romance. Even though the picture relied heavily on extravagant use of color, it was interesting to see the gala black and white Mardi Gras style party in costumed splendor. As befitting the title of the picture, a couple more of the lavish dance sequences relied heavily on red, white and blue, an appropriate statement considering Kelly's character an ex-GI. This film made AFI's original Top 100 Movies of all time in 1997, but dropped off a decade later when the listing was revised in 2007. Considering it's competition for the Best Picture Oscar in 1952, namely "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun", it's curious to me how this one would have taken top honors, but I've stopped fretting about these things a long time ago. For my money, I'll take Kelly's follow up a year later, "Singin' in the Rain", but if you're a fan of movie musicals, there's enough entertainment value in both to keep one satisfied.

    Jerry Mulligan is a struggling American artist in Paris, he gets coveted by a rich heiress who can help his struggling career. However, a visit to a night club and a meeting with a delicate young, but spoken for, French girl, leads him into a battle with himself. Winner of seven Academy Awards, An American In Paris is of course a delightful and breezy picture from the MGM vault. Said to be the personal favourite movie of Gene Kelly, it boasts wonderful tunes from George & Ira Gershwin, brilliant art direction from Cedric Gibbons, vivid Technicolor that fills the eyes, and quite stunning choreography from Gene Kelly. The film, all told, is high on production value and entertaining enough from start to finish. Yet the film's plot is showing definite age problems now, and it also lacks the ode to joy sense of purpose that, for example, Singing In The Rain has. I also feel it's a missed opportunity to actually film the picture entirely on location in Paris instead of on the MGM lot, because a bit of earthy core feels missing from the unfolding story. Leslie Caron as the love rival to the smokingly hot older woman played by Nina Foch, is majestic dance wise, but acting she's very staid, and this too is an irritation. However, I still adore this film very much, just not as much as Gene and the Academy did, apparently! Come the grand finale it's hard to be too critical when so much energy and deftness of feet has been constructed for our entertainment. With such a production it's suffice to say that now, with all the technological advances made in home entertainment, An American in Paris is an High Definition essential. 7/10

    This is a film, I've found, about which nobody can ever be persuaded. It's too much an example of its various genres (musical, dance-fest, inevitable romance, exotic setting) to ever transcend them. That locks one's reaction to this undeniable classic of the studio system  "Made in Hollywood, U.S.A.," indeed  into whether one likes those genres. If you love any or all of George (and Ira) Gershwin's work, intricate choreography, ballet taken to literally Impressionistic heights, Paris long-shots (yes, the second unit did go there, it wasn't all done in Culver City), and happy endings, you'll dote on this film. If you can't stand plots that mainly tie musical performances together, actors who are chosen for dance or singing talent more than thespian skills, or back-lot artifice (yes, the brilliant 17-minute ballet at the end is the ultimate example), you won't see it twice. That makes one smoothly written appraisal difficult. It's full of elements popping up from each genre. It's the studio system at its most and least successful. (Not "worst." Nothing with the Gershwins' work can EVER be a "worst.") So I'll jump in to defend several elements against some strong criticisms. Some of this depends on remembering the elephant on those "Parisian" streets: There'd been a war on. ~ Gene Kelly (Jerry Mulligan): He's frequently derided as too old, either in absolute terms or relative to the rest of the cast. Not at all! Exuberant skill undercuts his physical age by at least 15 years here. It also makes Jerry's pursuit of Lise far more plausible. I'm sorry, but it's just not "stalking," then or now. It's elegantly converted from machismo, the kind that many women have complained about when seeing it ... and even more when they don't see it. Nor is Kelly so overambitious as to fit uncomfortably in a penniless-painter role, as some have said. It's too easy to forget that Jerry's been in Paris since the Second World War ended. That tore spirits or bodies apart for nearly all the Americans who fought in it, sooner or later, partly from most being forced into a crusader role they didn't want. This G.I. could need a few years to reawaken his capacity for talented work and fervent love. ~ Leslie Caron (Lise): She didn't show earnest or assertive acting until "Gigi," true enough. She was a brilliant dancing partner for Kelly, and not much more. (Those eyes and that smile, though, were to die for even at that age.) Yet consider Lise's back story, such as it is  losing her parents, Resistance fighters, before adolescence, and growing up with mentors instead. Wouldn't that have made her less confident about what the world would bring to her? She, as well as Mulligan, blossoms slowly after a dry spell. ~ Georges Gu&eacute;tary (Henri): He's the grounded contrast to Jerry's shallower-rooted American. His confidence and resilience aren't at all overblown. He's had a performing career and he's sticking to making the most of it, which will include Lise if it can, but will ultimately go on without her if it must. This boulevardier has a quiet persistence that isn't immediately evident. ~ Oscar Levant (Adam): No, he is not at all superfluous to the story, nor to the romantic entanglements. Just look at the scene in the caf&eacute; where he's sitting between Henri and Jerry, and only he knows that the others love the same girl. His frantic reactions, when the men unknowingly talk about the same object of affection, show priceless comic timing and subtly discharge any over-emotion. Levant was a brilliant pianist, and this friend of the composer had to have a Gershwin showcase. (The last movement of the "Concerto in F," where he's imagining himself also as orchestra, conductor, and audience.) Yet he's not a survivor, as Jerry and Lise are, and he's not above it all, as Henri is. He has unfulfilled ambition and imagination, yet stays involved enough in life to appreciate enthusiasm and stay connected to friends. His deflation of Jerry's sponsor at the end is not just a bon mot, but an act of loyalty. ~ Nina Foch (Milo): Okay, she's a bit too young and beautiful to be entirely convincing as Jerry's older patron. Yet she has the most acting skills of any of the main characters, and she takes a thankless position in the story and makes it both dignified and funny. Her possessiveness about Jerry is understandable and is offset by considerable good humor and charm. She has ambitions, romantic and otherwise, but she's not insincere about them, as out-sized as they may be. Milo's rising interest and final withdrawal are both quietly skilled and acted out in a minimum of screen time. ~ The plot: Yes, it mainly ties the music together and compresses events to make room. Yes, at times it makes Jerry too persistent, Adam too acerbic, Milo too grasping, Lise too unquestioning, Henri too accepting. Yet it remains remarkable for making so many genres work together at all! Alan Jay Lerner knew it was just functional (Oscar notwithstanding). It was meant to turn an artistic salad, with Gershwin lettuce, into a tasty meal for the viewer, and it more than succeeded in doing so. ... So is this, even for a lover of the Gershwins' music, anywhere near perfect? It comes very close. The plot more than exceeds the burdens put upon it, but it still has little resonance, so I take away one star. Yet the actors rise to their situations and show their strengths beautifully. It really comes down to one truth, as a lyric says: "Our love is here to stay." Not necessarily for the studio confectionery, or the mannered acting, or the utility plot. But for the incomparable Gershwins, and for what could be so ably strung upon their brilliance.

    I watched this movie 59 years after it was released (God bless technology) and what struck me most was the difference in the culture. The love connection that drives the story is created when he literally stalks her until she laughingly concedes after which point, their love is assumed as a given. And for the "other guy" to deliver his cheating fianc&eacute;e to him at the end of the movie WITH A SMILE(!!??!!) is so far beyond ridiculous, I'm not even sure I saw it right. There were other instances but I think I've made my point. I don't think the story was intended to be the real draw here. At least I hope not. The music and dancing were so good (Gene Kelly has more charm and charisma in any single scene than most Hollywood studios can dream of cramming into their products these days), that despite the story line and the relationships portrayed being mind-boggling, the movie is fun and engaging. What motivated the characters to make some of the decisions they made is simply beyond me but I guess it was just a different time with different social norms and since the real selling points of the movie (the Gershwins music and Gene Kelly's screen presence) needed the plot to go a certain way in order to do their thing, it just did and all told, that's fine with me. If it wasn't for Gene Kelly and the Gershwins, this movie would have been a non-starter but with their immeasurable talent, it is a movie worth watching. Leslie Caron as a leading lady was an epic fail but I'm sure a lot of the blame for that lies in the story itself. It cannot be easy to play a lady who switches from angrily saying "You are downright annoying!" to giggling and agreeing to meet for a date a split second later because he refused to take no for an answer. But that's just my two scents. ;)

    Jerry Mulligan (Gene Kelly) is a struggling American painter who quit his job in the army to pursue his passion in the sizzling Paris. His good friend includes Adam Cook (Oscar Levant) an unknown pianist who lives in an apartment nearby. Adam introduces Jerry to Henri Baurel (Georges Guetary) a popular local crooner, who is to marry a 'vivacious, modern, enchanting, fascinating, exciting, sweet, shy and scholarly' dancer Lise ( Jerry does not know about this, however). Jerry puts his landscape paintings on display along the brick walls in the streets of Paris, and makes a paltry living out of it. His character is somewhat nasty, but many struggling street artists whom I have met are actually nasty with their take-it-or-leave attitude. He meets Milo (Nina Foch) a middle-aged rich woman who takes fancy to his paintings and agrees to buy two of his works. However, it can be observed here how Milo is actually trying to woo Jerry, as she tells Jerry that she does not have enough money and invites him to her hotel room. Madonna of the 50s, I say! Jerry does not respond well to her advances and starts flirting unabashedly with a young girl at the pub aka Lise. Jerry gets her number and almost prowls her to fall in love with him, which she eventually does. Conversely, Lise sets out more traps for Jerry. The rest is well. obvious. The Oscar and Golden Globes Associations have infamously awarded lesser deserving films, actors, actresses, supporting actors, supporting actresses, documentaries, music, screenplay. For example, Sandra Bullock's tough white compassionate mother act that paled even in comparison to a similar tough mom act by Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich. Or take the complete failure of recognition of 1952s 'Singin' in The Rain', a definitive musical masterpiece also starring Gene Kelly, and my personal choice for the greatest film of the 20th century. But to see 'An American in Paris' win Best Picture and Best Screenplay (!!!) is an unexpected and somewhat sour surprise. Why? Because An American in Paris is an incomplete film, lacking a thorough script, thin of memorable songs and dance sequences, short of convincing performances and devoid of a proper conclusion. How can this be rewarded the best script when the last twenty minutes did not receive enough momentum from the first ninety minutes, thus making the entire attempt somewhat flat? Gene Kelly's larger-than-life, showy persona proved an advantage in 'SITR' but here, where he has to downplay his character, it militates his likability. Also, his treatment of Jean Hagen's Lena Lamont in SITR was correct because of Lena's demanding diva personality. But to behave in the same way with Milo in AAIP made him a bit of a cad, especially when he drops her like a brick in the end without even considering her feelings for once, that too when he was acting in the same fashion albeit to woo Lise. He also has this slightly putting off habit of acting and moving in an affected way that is paradoxical to his role. Watch the first scene where he gets up fully aware that there is a camera in front of him, and then performs various movements in a rehearsed fashion. Works well at times, especially during the sing and dance numbers but lacks trueness otherwise. Hard to blame him though, since many actors 'act' this way. Leslie Caron does not live up to all the qualities mentioned about her by Henri. She seems shy, somewhat traditional and even reticent, like Talia Shire's character in Rocky. It is only when she dances that there comes some personality in her. But she still does not have the desired screen presence during the numbers, and cannot stand out when performing in a group. Also her chemistry with Gene is often bland and one-sided; Gene at least manages to show some fondness towards her while Leslie looks as if she is just playing along with him. Henri can sing well and act charmingly, but his character too is poorly given the chauffeur/dad-who-opposes-then-concedes treatment. They could have had some dialog between Henri and Lise, since love can't be so easily given up. And don't get me started on the ridiculous superhero-like costumes both Gene and Henri were wearing in the otherwise serious scene before the final performance! Oscar Levant was utterly wasted; he had a promising back-story or whatever you call it. They could have especially done more after his daydreaming concert act to draw attention upon his unfulfilled desires of becoming famous before the party scene. Oscar Levant, like many other actors, just parrots his lines without adding any gravity to it. Nina Foch was the only actor truly worth mentioning here; she conveys her dry charm, furtiveness and ultimately disappointment well. All of the songs are melodious but not catchy. However, they have the French charm that gives fervor to the movie. Even 'My Fair Lady' had fabulous numbers but I cannot remember any; it is because unlike Singing in the Rain or Marry Poppins or Sound of Music, they don't carry indelible hooks. So it isn't a fault, just a lacking. But the fault was to place all these numbers in this film; they failed to add up and boost the finale. Conversely, SITR placed its numbers so well that the 12 minute Broadway Melody spectacle at the end was just dazzling. I have to commend the unique filming techniques in the film: Lise could not be described more wonderfully, the one-man band was clever and the theatrical finishing was ingenious. The performances, especially the one between Kelly and Guetary brought a smile to my face. But the movie itself disappointed me; it seems like a beta version when compared to Singing in the Rain, but as a standalone, it was underwhelming. My Rating: 5.5 out of 10

    Take an accomplished director, one of the world's most famous dancers, a dreamily romantic setting and music from none other than George Gershwin and what do you have? In the case of An American in Paris, you have a film which, for me, falls flat on its face. The winning combination of talent and reputation thrilled the critics, back in 1951 and the film was showered with awards including six Oscars. But, looked at coldly and in retrospect, it's difficult to understand why . Right from the opening scene, when Gene Kelly  who is supposed to be starving in a Paris garret  wakes up looking prosperous, over-confident and heavily made-up, you can already hear the turkey feathers starting to rustle. The story falters and bumbles its way through yawning intervals which separate the big numbers and the characters become less convincing with every scene. Leslie Caron, when she finally turns up, looks terrified and toothy and though she dances superbly, seems too timid to bring magic to any of her scenes. She and Kelly dance pretty well together, technically, but without the slightest sense of partnership. Watching them, I got the impression that each would rather have been somewhere else. The music, despite such great numbers, seems to have been shoe-horned into the narrative and often, doesn't fit. The scene where Gershwin's rattlingly wonderful Concerto in F is performed, for instance, has nothing to do with anything else in the film. It does, however, provide moments of sweet relief from the limping story and embarrassingly stilted scenes. It's hard to believe that Oklahoma was released only four years later, in 1955 and yet, seems to belong to a different era. Oklahoma succeeds in every respect where An American in Paris fails. The acting is convincing, the story works well, the casting is faultless, the choreography - apart from the disappointing dream sequence - is sublime. But above all, the characters in Oklahoma perform with zest and sparkle in overdrive. That makes the film overflow with a sense of freshness, excitement and overflowing 'joy de vivre'. What a difference!

    After service in World War II, singer-dancer and struggling painter Gene Kelly (as Jerry Mulligan) settles on the Left Bank of Paris. His handsome features attract heiress Nina Foch (as Milo Roberts) and Mr. Kelly quickly becomes her escort. While out nightclubbing with his sponsor, Kelly sets he his sights on pretty young Leslie Caron (as Lise Bouvier). However, she is seeing local entertainer Georges Guetary (as Henri Baurel). Another American in Paris, pianist Oscar Levant (as Adam Cook), connects the lovers. Outstanding singing, dancing, impressions and setting in a too long and flimsy story; the art remains. ******** An American in Paris (8/26/51) Vincente Minnelli ~ Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant, Georges Guetary

    Fans of the movie genres known as "Musical", "Classic", and "Romance" and pure true lovers, lend me your ear. If you looking for the perfect romance musical, then the Oscar-winning "An American in Paris" is really the right movie for you. From the first minute, you, fellow viewer and reader, has been transformed into a cinematic world of lavishing color, enchanting magic and endless delights. After the end, even the whole movie stays with you for long as you can remember. This is the story of Jerry Mulligan {Gene Kelly}, a former American GI living in Paris making paintings and making friends with pianist Adam Cook {Oscar Levant} and singer Henri Baurel {Georges Guetary}. He soon finds love in the form of Lise Bouvier {Leslie Caron}, but soon romantic problems develop and Lise is not sure of what to do with her future with Jerry. This is one of the most delicious and most shining musicals around, and the superb score and choreography shows why this film feels not really dated. George and Ira Gershwin has mastered a genius of a lovely score right here, filled with so much many hummable songs such as "I Got Rhythm", "Our Love is Here to Stay", "Stairway to Paradise" and so much more. This is really and truly better than most of the music we have today. The choreography by Kelly is and truly a revelation. The most memorable of these, the ballet in the end, is one of the most ingenious and wondrous musical numbers we have ever seen in the history of the American musical. Kelly gives an everyday guy persona to Jerry. Once he becomes a character, we stay with him that way. The way he acts, the way he really dances, the way he sings, he really is a different type of a character. Caron really delivers in her first film role as Lise. She gives a lighting spark of radiance and power to the character. The moments that Kelly and Caron are together, the heart of romance goes aflutter and the viewer suddenly has gone love struck, rooting for them all the way. Even the supporting cast is feeling the magic as we speak. Levant is very funny and sensational. He delivers the film's comic moment when he conducts his own orchestra performing his own piece in a hilarious dream. Guetary is all dapper and gay. He is truly a wonder performing "Stairway to Paradise". Nina Foch also delivers as Jerry's society friend, Milo. She delivers one of the film's best one liners when waiting for a date with Jerry and another girl, Jerry asks "Who is the other girl?" Milo says "Me." Vincente Minnelli delivers a fantastic film here. Alan Jay Lerner's script is nothing short of delightful. The costumes and the sets by Orry-Kelly, Preston Kelly and Cedric Gibbons, respectively, are full of splendor and life. This is really a magnificent and can't miss film to watch not just by yourself, but for the whole entire family, even your pet. Rarely has a musical felt so much lovely and perfectly as this.

    The story is surprisingly intense and actually eclipses the dancing sequences which are impressive. As much as the movies's plot may seem hokey and contrived, it really isn't. The story is plausible; people can fall in love immediately and get swept up in their emotions. Gene Kelly gives a great performance as an expatriate American and Leslie Caron proves to be dynamic in her role. The final dance sequence is incredible, combining several different dance forms. What makes this movie even stronger is that the story is simple, the characters likable and the music outstanding. The dream sequence with Oscar Levant was brilliant. There is nothing wrong with an upbeat movie featuring wonderfully talented actors who actually entertain. They sing, they dance, there is music and a happy ending. What's wrong with that? Nothing. This movie deserved the honors it received. Street Car and A Place in the Sun were marvelous movies, but a quality musical will trump a bleak, black-and-white drama anytime, like it did in 1951. Who would an audience rather watch: Gene Kelly laughing and dancing with Leslie Caron to the music of George Gershwin or gloomy Montgomery Clift plotting to kill a hapless Shelly Winters?

    I'e been a huge fan of "Singin' in the Rain" for quite some time now. I loved the songs, costumes, story, and actors in that one. I had heard of AAIP for a while, too. I've heard it was spectacular and decided to give it a whirl. It's not the worst I've ever seen, oh no. But definitely one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. First of all, Gene Kelly wasn't my favorite in SITR (I prefer Donald O'Connor). But I still thought he was alright. But he wasn't nearly as good in AAIP. His singing is okay here and there. But he doesn't do anything that makes me stare with wide eyes. I've always thought he was overrated. Not bad. But definitely overrated. And I didn't like his character much in this one, either. Also, his chemistry with Leslie Caron is not very believable, in my opinion. Speaking of Leslie, this was her first film. So I understand how she might be uncomfortable. But, am I the only one who doesn't think she's that pretty in this one? I thought she was fabulous in "Gigi" (1958). She was gorgeous and very talented in that one. But this one, she was missing something. But it was fun to watch her dance on pointe. Kelly's pal, Oscar Levant, is supposed to be the comic relief. Well, he wasn't at all comical, or at all a relief, for that matter. I loved his piano playing and I hope to be as good as him someday. But he was about as humorous as a brick and not a good actor, either. If you want a real good Gene Kelly pal, watch Donald O'Connor in SITR. He's actually funny and talented in many ways. So, I only gave this a 5 because of Levant's piano playing (which was magnificent), Kelly's "I Got Rhythmn" number with the little kids (but I do still prefer Judy Garland's version of the song), and the ballet at the end. As much as I love SITR, it's ballet was not as exciting. I did like the ballet in AAIP very much. So, all in all, it's a so-so movie. If you like that sort of thing, go ahead and watch it. But I'm warning you. You'd be much better off with watching "Singin' in the Rain".

    Movie musicals aren't my strong suit, but most of the time when I see one it manages to be entertaining enough. Gene Kelly has a way of making all of his dance moves seem effortlessly easy, and watching Leslie Caron keep in step with him is one of the highlights of the film. I wasn't too crazy about the romantic entanglements in the story, as Jerry Mulligan (Kelly) seemed better suited to end up with his sponsor Milo Roberts (Nina Foch); while Caron's character didn't seem to be a match for either Jerry or her fianc&eacute;e. I never could quite understand how a jilted lover, in this case Henri (Georges Guetary), manages to be so gallant in the end when his girlfriend goes off with another man. The main attraction here is the song and dance. Kelly is fun to watch in every one of his numbers, and the sequence featuring his pianist buddy Adam (Oscar Levant) was fairly innovative and entertaining. I got a kick out of the way Levant reacted to Henri's counsel for Jerry in matters of love and romance. Even though the picture relied heavily on extravagant use of color, it was interesting to see the gala black and white Mardi Gras style party in costumed splendor. As befitting the title of the picture, a couple more of the lavish dance sequences relied heavily on red, white and blue, an appropriate statement considering Kelly's character an ex-GI. This film made AFI's original Top 100 Movies of all time in 1997, but dropped off a decade later when the listing was revised in 2007. Considering it's competition for the Best Picture Oscar in 1952, namely "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun", it's curious to me how this one would have taken top honors, but I've stopped fretting about these things a long time ago. For my money, I'll take Kelly's follow up a year later, "Singin' in the Rain", but if you're a fan of movie musicals, there's enough entertainment value in both to keep one satisfied.

    Jerry Mulligan is a struggling American artist in Paris, he gets coveted by a rich heiress who can help his struggling career. However, a visit to a night club and a meeting with a delicate young, but spoken for, French girl, leads him into a battle with himself. Winner of seven Academy Awards, An American In Paris is of course a delightful and breezy picture from the MGM vault. Said to be the personal favourite movie of Gene Kelly, it boasts wonderful tunes from George & Ira Gershwin, brilliant art direction from Cedric Gibbons, vivid Technicolor that fills the eyes, and quite stunning choreography from Gene Kelly. The film, all told, is high on production value and entertaining enough from start to finish. Yet the film's plot is showing definite age problems now, and it also lacks the ode to joy sense of purpose that, for example, Singing In The Rain has. I also feel it's a missed opportunity to actually film the picture entirely on location in Paris instead of on the MGM lot, because a bit of earthy core feels missing from the unfolding story. Leslie Caron as the love rival to the smokingly hot older woman played by Nina Foch, is majestic dance wise, but acting she's very staid, and this too is an irritation. However, I still adore this film very much, just not as much as Gene and the Academy did, apparently! Come the grand finale it's hard to be too critical when so much energy and deftness of feet has been constructed for our entertainment. With such a production it's suffice to say that now, with all the technological advances made in home entertainment, An American in Paris is an High Definition essential. 7/10

    This is a film, I've found, about which nobody can ever be persuaded. It's too much an example of its various genres (musical, dance-fest, inevitable romance, exotic setting) to ever transcend them. That locks one's reaction to this undeniable classic of the studio system  "Made in Hollywood, U.S.A.," indeed  into whether one likes those genres. If you love any or all of George (and Ira) Gershwin's work, intricate choreography, ballet taken to literally Impressionistic heights, Paris long-shots (yes, the second unit did go there, it wasn't all done in Culver City), and happy endings, you'll dote on this film. If you can't stand plots that mainly tie musical performances together, actors who are chosen for dance or singing talent more than thespian skills, or back-lot artifice (yes, the brilliant 17-minute ballet at the end is the ultimate example), you won't see it twice. That makes one smoothly written appraisal difficult. It's full of elements popping up from each genre. It's the studio system at its most and least successful. (Not "worst." Nothing with the Gershwins' work can EVER be a "worst.") So I'll jump in to defend several elements against some strong criticisms. Some of this depends on remembering the elephant on those "Parisian" streets: There'd been a war on. ~ Gene Kelly (Jerry Mulligan): He's frequently derided as too old, either in absolute terms or relative to the rest of the cast. Not at all! Exuberant skill undercuts his physical age by at least 15 years here. It also makes Jerry's pursuit of Lise far more plausible. I'm sorry, but it's just not "stalking," then or now. It's elegantly converted from machismo, the kind that many women have complained about when seeing it ... and even more when they don't see it. Nor is Kelly so overambitious as to fit uncomfortably in a penniless-painter role, as some have said. It's too easy to forget that Jerry's been in Paris since the Second World War ended. That tore spirits or bodies apart for nearly all the Americans who fought in it, sooner or later, partly from most being forced into a crusader role they didn't want. This G.I. could need a few years to reawaken his capacity for talented work and fervent love. ~ Leslie Caron (Lise): She didn't show earnest or assertive acting until "Gigi," true enough. She was a brilliant dancing partner for Kelly, and not much more. (Those eyes and that smile, though, were to die for even at that age.) Yet consider Lise's back story, such as it is  losing her parents, Resistance fighters, before adolescence, and growing up with mentors instead. Wouldn't that have made her less confident about what the world would bring to her? She, as well as Mulligan, blossoms slowly after a dry spell. ~ Georges Gu&eacute;tary (Henri): He's the grounded contrast to Jerry's shallower-rooted American. His confidence and resilience aren't at all overblown. He's had a performing career and he's sticking to making the most of it, which will include Lise if it can, but will ultimately go on without her if it must. This boulevardier has a quiet persistence that isn't immediately evident. ~ Oscar Levant (Adam): No, he is not at all superfluous to the story, nor to the romantic entanglements. Just look at the scene in the caf&eacute; where he's sitting between Henri and Jerry, and only he knows that the others love the same girl. His frantic reactions, when the men unknowingly talk about the same object of affection, show priceless comic timing and subtly discharge any over-emotion. Levant was a brilliant pianist, and this friend of the composer had to have a Gershwin showcase. (The last movement of the "Concerto in F," where he's imagining himself also as orchestra, conductor, and audience.) Yet he's not a survivor, as Jerry and Lise are, and he's not above it all, as Henri is. He has unfulfilled ambition and imagination, yet stays involved enough in life to appreciate enthusiasm and stay connected to friends. His deflation of Jerry's sponsor at the end is not just a bon mot, but an act of loyalty. ~ Nina Foch (Milo): Okay, she's a bit too young and beautiful to be entirely convincing as Jerry's older patron. Yet she has the most acting skills of any of the main characters, and she takes a thankless position in the story and makes it both dignified and funny. Her possessiveness about Jerry is understandable and is offset by considerable good humor and charm. She has ambitions, romantic and otherwise, but she's not insincere about them, as out-sized as they may be. Milo's rising interest and final withdrawal are both quietly skilled and acted out in a minimum of screen time. ~ The plot: Yes, it mainly ties the music together and compresses events to make room. Yes, at times it makes Jerry too persistent, Adam too acerbic, Milo too grasping, Lise too unquestioning, Henri too accepting. Yet it remains remarkable for making so many genres work together at all! Alan Jay Lerner knew it was just functional (Oscar notwithstanding). It was meant to turn an artistic salad, with Gershwin lettuce, into a tasty meal for the viewer, and it more than succeeded in doing so. ... So is this, even for a lover of the Gershwins' music, anywhere near perfect? It comes very close. The plot more than exceeds the burdens put upon it, but it still has little resonance, so I take away one star. Yet the actors rise to their situations and show their strengths beautifully. It really comes down to one truth, as a lyric says: "Our love is here to stay." Not necessarily for the studio confectionery, or the mannered acting, or the utility plot. But for the incomparable Gershwins, and for what could be so ably strung upon their brilliance.

    I watched this movie 59 years after it was released (God bless technology) and what struck me most was the difference in the culture. The love connection that drives the story is created when he literally stalks her until she laughingly concedes after which point, their love is assumed as a given. And for the "other guy" to deliver his cheating fianc&eacute;e to him at the end of the movie WITH A SMILE(!!??!!) is so far beyond ridiculous, I'm not even sure I saw it right. There were other instances but I think I've made my point. I don't think the story was intended to be the real draw here. At least I hope not. The music and dancing were so good (Gene Kelly has more charm and charisma in any single scene than most Hollywood studios can dream of cramming into their products these days), that despite the story line and the relationships portrayed being mind-boggling, the movie is fun and engaging. What motivated the characters to make some of the decisions they made is simply beyond me but I guess it was just a different time with different social norms and since the real selling points of the movie (the Gershwins music and Gene Kelly's screen presence) needed the plot to go a certain way in order to do their thing, it just did and all told, that's fine with me. If it wasn't for Gene Kelly and the Gershwins, this movie would have been a non-starter but with their immeasurable talent, it is a movie worth watching. Leslie Caron as a leading lady was an epic fail but I'm sure a lot of the blame for that lies in the story itself. It cannot be easy to play a lady who switches from angrily saying "You are downright annoying!" to giggling and agreeing to meet for a date a split second later because he refused to take no for an answer. But that's just my two scents. ;)

    Jerry Mulligan (Gene Kelly) is a struggling American painter who quit his job in the army to pursue his passion in the sizzling Paris. His good friend includes Adam Cook (Oscar Levant) an unknown pianist who lives in an apartment nearby. Adam introduces Jerry to Henri Baurel (Georges Guetary) a popular local crooner, who is to marry a 'vivacious, modern, enchanting, fascinating, exciting, sweet, shy and scholarly' dancer Lise ( Jerry does not know about this, however). Jerry puts his landscape paintings on display along the brick walls in the streets of Paris, and makes a paltry living out of it. His character is somewhat nasty, but many struggling street artists whom I have met are actually nasty with their take-it-or-leave attitude. He meets Milo (Nina Foch) a middle-aged rich woman who takes fancy to his paintings and agrees to buy two of his works. However, it can be observed here how Milo is actually trying to woo Jerry, as she tells Jerry that she does not have enough money and invites him to her hotel room. Madonna of the 50s, I say! Jerry does not respond well to her advances and starts flirting unabashedly with a young girl at the pub aka Lise. Jerry gets her number and almost prowls her to fall in love with him, which she eventually does. Conversely, Lise sets out more traps for Jerry. The rest is well. obvious. The Oscar and Golden Globes Associations have infamously awarded lesser deserving films, actors, actresses, supporting actors, supporting actresses, documentaries, music, screenplay. For example, Sandra Bullock's tough white compassionate mother act that paled even in comparison to a similar tough mom act by Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich. Or take the complete failure of recognition of 1952s 'Singin' in The Rain', a definitive musical masterpiece also starring Gene Kelly, and my personal choice for the greatest film of the 20th century. But to see 'An American in Paris' win Best Picture and Best Screenplay (!!!) is an unexpected and somewhat sour surprise. Why? Because An American in Paris is an incomplete film, lacking a thorough script, thin of memorable songs and dance sequences, short of convincing performances and devoid of a proper conclusion. How can this be rewarded the best script when the last twenty minutes did not receive enough momentum from the first ninety minutes, thus making the entire attempt somewhat flat? Gene Kelly's larger-than-life, showy persona proved an advantage in 'SITR' but here, where he has to downplay his character, it militates his likability. Also, his treatment of Jean Hagen's Lena Lamont in SITR was correct because of Lena's demanding diva personality. But to behave in the same way with Milo in AAIP made him a bit of a cad, especially when he drops her like a brick in the end without even considering her feelings for once, that too when he was acting in the same fashion albeit to woo Lise. He also has this slightly putting off habit of acting and moving in an affected way that is paradoxical to his role. Watch the first scene where he gets up fully aware that there is a camera in front of him, and then performs various movements in a rehearsed fashion. Works well at times, especially during the sing and dance numbers but lacks trueness otherwise. Hard to blame him though, since many actors 'act' this way. Leslie Caron does not live up to all the qualities mentioned about her by Henri. She seems shy, somewhat traditional and even reticent, like Talia Shire's character in Rocky. It is only when she dances that there comes some personality in her. But she still does not have the desired screen presence during the numbers, and cannot stand out when performing in a group. Also her chemistry with Gene is often bland and one-sided; Gene at least manages to show some fondness towards her while Leslie looks as if she is just playing along with him. Henri can sing well and act charmingly, but his character too is poorly given the chauffeur/dad-who-opposes-then-concedes treatment. They could have had some dialog between Henri and Lise, since love can't be so easily given up. And don't get me started on the ridiculous superhero-like costumes both Gene and Henri were wearing in the otherwise serious scene before the final performance! Oscar Levant was utterly wasted; he had a promising back-story or whatever you call it. They could have especially done more after his daydreaming concert act to draw attention upon his unfulfilled desires of becoming famous before the party scene. Oscar Levant, like many other actors, just parrots his lines without adding any gravity to it. Nina Foch was the only actor truly worth mentioning here; she conveys her dry charm, furtiveness and ultimately disappointment well. All of the songs are melodious but not catchy. However, they have the French charm that gives fervor to the movie. Even 'My Fair Lady' had fabulous numbers but I cannot remember any; it is because unlike Singing in the Rain or Marry Poppins or Sound of Music, they don't carry indelible hooks. So it isn't a fault, just a lacking. But the fault was to place all these numbers in this film; they failed to add up and boost the finale. Conversely, SITR placed its numbers so well that the 12 minute Broadway Melody spectacle at the end was just dazzling. I have to commend the unique filming techniques in the film: Lise could not be described more wonderfully, the one-man band was clever and the theatrical finishing was ingenious. The performances, especially the one between Kelly and Guetary brought a smile to my face. But the movie itself disappointed me; it seems like a beta version when compared to Singing in the Rain, but as a standalone, it was underwhelming. My Rating: 5.5 out of 10

    Take an accomplished director, one of the world's most famous dancers, a dreamily romantic setting and music from none other than George Gershwin and what do you have? In the case of An American in Paris, you have a film which, for me, falls flat on its face. The winning combination of talent and reputation thrilled the critics, back in 1951 and the film was showered with awards including six Oscars. But, looked at coldly and in retrospect, it's difficult to understand why . Right from the opening scene, when Gene Kelly  who is supposed to be starving in a Paris garret  wakes up looking prosperous, over-confident and heavily made-up, you can already hear the turkey feathers starting to rustle. The story falters and bumbles its way through yawning intervals which separate the big numbers and the characters become less convincing with every scene. Leslie Caron, when she finally turns up, looks terrified and toothy and though she dances superbly, seems too timid to bring magic to any of her scenes. She and Kelly dance pretty well together, technically, but without the slightest sense of partnership. Watching them, I got the impression that each would rather have been somewhere else. The music, despite such great numbers, seems to have been shoe-horned into the narrative and often, doesn't fit. The scene where Gershwin's rattlingly wonderful Concerto in F is performed, for instance, has nothing to do with anything else in the film. It does, however, provide moments of sweet relief from the limping story and embarrassingly stilted scenes. It's hard to believe that Oklahoma was released only four years later, in 1955 and yet, seems to belong to a different era. Oklahoma succeeds in every respect where An American in Paris fails. The acting is convincing, the story works well, the casting is faultless, the choreography - apart from the disappointing dream sequence - is sublime. But above all, the characters in Oklahoma perform with zest and sparkle in overdrive. That makes the film overflow with a sense of freshness, excitement and overflowing 'joy de vivre'. What a difference!

    After service in World War II, singer-dancer and struggling painter Gene Kelly (as Jerry Mulligan) settles on the Left Bank of Paris. His handsome features attract heiress Nina Foch (as Milo Roberts) and Mr. Kelly quickly becomes her escort. While out nightclubbing with his sponsor, Kelly sets he his sights on pretty young Leslie Caron (as Lise Bouvier). However, she is seeing local entertainer Georges Guetary (as Henri Baurel). Another American in Paris, pianist Oscar Levant (as Adam Cook), connects the lovers. Outstanding singing, dancing, impressions and setting in a too long and flimsy story; the art remains. ******** An American in Paris (8/26/51) Vincente Minnelli ~ Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant, Georges Guetary

    Fans of the movie genres known as "Musical", "Classic", and "Romance" and pure true lovers, lend me your ear. If you looking for the perfect romance musical, then the Oscar-winning "An American in Paris" is really the right movie for you. From the first minute, you, fellow viewer and reader, has been transformed into a cinematic world of lavishing color, enchanting magic and endless delights. After the end, even the whole movie stays with you for long as you can remember. This is the story of Jerry Mulligan {Gene Kelly}, a former American GI living in Paris making paintings and making friends with pianist Adam Cook {Oscar Levant} and singer Henri Baurel {Georges Guetary}. He soon finds love in the form of Lise Bouvier {Leslie Caron}, but soon romantic problems develop and Lise is not sure of what to do with her future with Jerry. This is one of the most delicious and most shining musicals around, and the superb score and choreography shows why this film feels not really dated. George and Ira Gershwin has mastered a genius of a lovely score right here, filled with so much many hummable songs such as "I Got Rhythm", "Our Love is Here to Stay", "Stairway to Paradise" and so much more. This is really and truly better than most of the music we have today. The choreography by Kelly is and truly a revelation. The most memorable of these, the ballet in the end, is one of the most ingenious and wondrous musical numbers we have ever seen in the history of the American musical. Kelly gives an everyday guy persona to Jerry. Once he becomes a character, we stay with him that way. The way he acts, the way he really dances, the way he sings, he really is a different type of a character. Caron really delivers in her first film role as Lise. She gives a lighting spark of radiance and power to the character. The moments that Kelly and Caron are together, the heart of romance goes aflutter and the viewer suddenly has gone love struck, rooting for them all the way. Even the supporting cast is feeling the magic as we speak. Levant is very funny and sensational. He delivers the film's comic moment when he conducts his own orchestra performing his own piece in a hilarious dream. Guetary is all dapper and gay. He is truly a wonder performing "Stairway to Paradise". Nina Foch also delivers as Jerry's society friend, Milo. She delivers one of the film's best one liners when waiting for a date with Jerry and another girl, Jerry asks "Who is the other girl?" Milo says "Me." Vincente Minnelli delivers a fantastic film here. Alan Jay Lerner's script is nothing short of delightful. The costumes and the sets by Orry-Kelly, Preston Kelly and Cedric Gibbons, respectively, are full of splendor and life. This is really a magnificent and can't miss film to watch not just by yourself, but for the whole entire family, even your pet. Rarely has a musical felt so much lovely and perfectly as this.

    The story is surprisingly intense and actually eclipses the dancing sequences which are impressive. As much as the movies's plot may seem hokey and contrived, it really isn't. The story is plausible; people can fall in love immediately and get swept up in their emotions. Gene Kelly gives a great performance as an expatriate American and Leslie Caron proves to be dynamic in her role. The final dance sequence is incredible, combining several different dance forms. What makes this movie even stronger is that the story is simple, the characters likable and the music outstanding. The dream sequence with Oscar Levant was brilliant. There is nothing wrong with an upbeat movie featuring wonderfully talented actors who actually entertain. They sing, they dance, there is music and a happy ending. What's wrong with that? Nothing. This movie deserved the honors it received. Street Car and A Place in the Sun were marvelous movies, but a quality musical will trump a bleak, black-and-white drama anytime, like it did in 1951. Who would an audience rather watch: Gene Kelly laughing and dancing with Leslie Caron to the music of George Gershwin or gloomy Montgomery Clift plotting to kill a hapless Shelly Winters?

    I'e been a huge fan of "Singin' in the Rain" for quite some time now. I loved the songs, costumes, story, and actors in that one. I had heard of AAIP for a while, too. I've heard it was spectacular and decided to give it a whirl. It's not the worst I've ever seen, oh no. But definitely one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. First of all, Gene Kelly wasn't my favorite in SITR (I prefer Donald O'Connor). But I still thought he was alright. But he wasn't nearly as good in AAIP. His singing is okay here and there. But he doesn't do anything that makes me stare with wide eyes. I've always thought he was overrated. Not bad. But definitely overrated. And I didn't like his character much in this one, either. Also, his chemistry with Leslie Caron is not very believable, in my opinion. Speaking of Leslie, this was her first film. So I understand how she might be uncomfortable. But, am I the only one who doesn't think she's that pretty in this one? I thought she was fabulous in "Gigi" (1958). She was gorgeous and very talented in that one. But this one, she was missing something. But it was fun to watch her dance on pointe. Kelly's pal, Oscar Levant, is supposed to be the comic relief. Well, he wasn't at all comical, or at all a relief, for that matter. I loved his piano playing and I hope to be as good as him someday. But he was about as humorous as a brick and not a good actor, either. If you want a real good Gene Kelly pal, watch Donald O'Connor in SITR. He's actually funny and talented in many ways. So, I only gave this a 5 because of Levant's piano playing (which was magnificent), Kelly's "I Got Rhythmn" number with the little kids (but I do still prefer Judy Garland's version of the song), and the ballet at the end. As much as I love SITR, it's ballet was not as exciting. I did like the ballet in AAIP very much. So, all in all, it's a so-so movie. If you like that sort of thing, go ahead and watch it. But I'm warning you. You'd be much better off with watching "Singin' in the Rain".

    Movie musicals aren't my strong suit, but most of the time when I see one it manages to be entertaining enough. Gene Kelly has a way of making all of his dance moves seem effortlessly easy, and watching Leslie Caron keep in step with him is one of the highlights of the film. I wasn't too crazy about the romantic entanglements in the story, as Jerry Mulligan (Kelly) seemed better suited to end up with his sponsor Milo Roberts (Nina Foch); while Caron's character didn't seem to be a match for either Jerry or her fianc&eacute;e. I never could quite understand how a jilted lover, in this case Henri (Georges Guetary), manages to be so gallant in the end when his girlfriend goes off with another man. The main attraction here is the song and dance. Kelly is fun to watch in every one of his numbers, and the sequence featuring his pianist buddy Adam (Oscar Levant) was fairly innovative and entertaining. I got a kick out of the way Levant reacted to Henri's counsel for Jerry in matters of love and romance. Even though the picture relied heavily on extravagant use of color, it was interesting to see the gala black and white Mardi Gras style party in costumed splendor. As befitting the title of the picture, a couple more of the lavish dance sequences relied heavily on red, white and blue, an appropriate statement considering Kelly's character an ex-GI. This film made AFI's original Top 100 Movies of all time in 1997, but dropped off a decade later when the listing was revised in 2007. Considering it's competition for the Best Picture Oscar in 1952, namely "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun", it's curious to me how this one would have taken top honors, but I've stopped fretting about these things a long time ago. For my money, I'll take Kelly's follow up a year later, "Singin' in the Rain", but if you're a fan of movie musicals, there's enough entertainment value in both to keep one satisfied.

    Jerry Mulligan is a struggling American artist in Paris, he gets coveted by a rich heiress who can help his struggling career. However, a visit to a night club and a meeting with a delicate young, but spoken for, French girl, leads him into a battle with himself. Winner of seven Academy Awards, An American In Paris is of course a delightful and breezy picture from the MGM vault. Said to be the personal favourite movie of Gene Kelly, it boasts wonderful tunes from George & Ira Gershwin, brilliant art direction from Cedric Gibbons, vivid Technicolor that fills the eyes, and quite stunning choreography from Gene Kelly. The film, all told, is high on production value and entertaining enough from start to finish. Yet the film's plot is showing definite age problems now, and it also lacks the ode to joy sense of purpose that, for example, Singing In The Rain has. I also feel it's a missed opportunity to actually film the picture entirely on location in Paris instead of on the MGM lot, because a bit of earthy core feels missing from the unfolding story. Leslie Caron as the love rival to the smokingly hot older woman played by Nina Foch, is majestic dance wise, but acting she's very staid, and this too is an irritation. However, I still adore this film very much, just not as much as Gene and the Academy did, apparently! Come the grand finale it's hard to be too critical when so much energy and deftness of feet has been constructed for our entertainment. With such a production it's suffice to say that now, with all the technological advances made in home entertainment, An American in Paris is an High Definition essential. 7/10

    This is a film, I've found, about which nobody can ever be persuaded. It's too much an example of its various genres (musical, dance-fest, inevitable romance, exotic setting) to ever transcend them. That locks one's reaction to this undeniable classic of the studio system  "Made in Hollywood, U.S.A.," indeed  into whether one likes those genres. If you love any or all of George (and Ira) Gershwin's work, intricate choreography, ballet taken to literally Impressionistic heights, Paris long-shots (yes, the second unit did go there, it wasn't all done in Culver City), and happy endings, you'll dote on this film. If you can't stand plots that mainly tie musical performances together, actors who are chosen for dance or singing talent more than thespian skills, or back-lot artifice (yes, the brilliant 17-minute ballet at the end is the ultimate example), you won't see it twice. That makes one smoothly written appraisal difficult. It's full of elements popping up from each genre. It's the studio system at its most and least successful. (Not "worst." Nothing with the Gershwins' work can EVER be a "worst.") So I'll jump in to defend several elements against some strong criticisms. Some of this depends on remembering the elephant on those "Parisian" streets: There'd been a war on. ~ Gene Kelly (Jerry Mulligan): He's frequently derided as too old, either in absolute terms or relative to the rest of the cast. Not at all! Exuberant skill undercuts his physical age by at least 15 years here. It also makes Jerry's pursuit of Lise far more plausible. I'm sorry, but it's just not "stalking," then or now. It's elegantly converted from machismo, the kind that many women have complained about when seeing it ... and even more when they don't see it. Nor is Kelly so overambitious as to fit uncomfortably in a penniless-painter role, as some have said. It's too easy to forget that Jerry's been in Paris since the Second World War ended. That tore spirits or bodies apart for nearly all the Americans who fought in it, sooner or later, partly from most being forced into a crusader role they didn't want. This G.I. could need a few years to reawaken his capacity for talented work and fervent love. ~ Leslie Caron (Lise): She didn't show earnest or assertive acting until "Gigi," true enough. She was a brilliant dancing partner for Kelly, and not much more. (Those eyes and that smile, though, were to die for even at that age.) Yet consider Lise's back story, such as it is  losing her parents, Resistance fighters, before adolescence, and growing up with mentors instead. Wouldn't that have made her less confident about what the world would bring to her? She, as well as Mulligan, blossoms slowly after a dry spell. ~ Georges Gu&eacute;tary (Henri): He's the grounded contrast to Jerry's shallower-rooted American. His confidence and resilience aren't at all overblown. He's had a performing career and he's sticking to making the most of it, which will include Lise if it can, but will ultimately go on without her if it must. This boulevardier has a quiet persistence that isn't immediately evident. ~ Oscar Levant (Adam): No, he is not at all superfluous to the story, nor to the romantic entanglements. Just look at the scene in the caf&eacute; where he's sitting between Henri and Jerry, and only he knows that the others love the same girl. His frantic reactions, when the men unknowingly talk about the same object of affection, show priceless comic timing and subtly discharge any over-emotion. Levant was a brilliant pianist, and this friend of the composer had to have a Gershwin showcase. (The last movement of the "Concerto in F," where he's imagining himself also as orchestra, conductor, and audience.) Yet he's not a survivor, as Jerry and Lise are, and he's not above it all, as Henri is. He has unfulfilled ambition and imagination, yet stays involved enough in life to appreciate enthusiasm and stay connected to friends. His deflation of Jerry's sponsor at the end is not just a bon mot, but an act of loyalty. ~ Nina Foch (Milo): Okay, she's a bit too young and beautiful to be entirely convincing as Jerry's older patron. Yet she has the most acting skills of any of the main characters, and she takes a thankless position in the story and makes it both dignified and funny. Her possessiveness about Jerry is understandable and is offset by considerable good humor and charm. She has ambitions, romantic and otherwise, but she's not insincere about them, as out-sized as they may be. Milo's rising interest and final withdrawal are both quietly skilled and acted out in a minimum of screen time. ~ The plot: Yes, it mainly ties the music together and compresses events to make room. Yes, at times it makes Jerry too persistent, Adam too acerbic, Milo too grasping, Lise too unquestioning, Henri too accepting. Yet it remains remarkable for making so many genres work together at all! Alan Jay Lerner knew it was just functional (Oscar notwithstanding). It was meant to turn an artistic salad, with Gershwin lettuce, into a tasty meal for the viewer, and it more than succeeded in doing so. ... So is this, even for a lover of the Gershwins' music, anywhere near perfect? It comes very close. The plot more than exceeds the burdens put upon it, but it still has little resonance, so I take away one star. Yet the actors rise to their situations and show their strengths beautifully. It really comes down to one truth, as a lyric says: "Our love is here to stay." Not necessarily for the studio confectionery, or the mannered acting, or the utility plot. But for the incomparable Gershwins, and for what could be so ably strung upon their brilliance.

    I watched this movie 59 years after it was released (God bless technology) and what struck me most was the difference in the culture. The love connection that drives the story is created when he literally stalks her until she laughingly concedes after which point, their love is assumed as a given. And for the "other guy" to deliver his cheating fianc&eacute;e to him at the end of the movie WITH A SMILE(!!??!!) is so far beyond ridiculous, I'm not even sure I saw it right. There were other instances but I think I've made my point. I don't think the story was intended to be the real draw here. At least I hope not. The music and dancing were so good (Gene Kelly has more charm and charisma in any single scene than most Hollywood studios can dream of cramming into their products these days), that despite the story line and the relationships portrayed being mind-boggling, the movie is fun and engaging. What motivated the characters to make some of the decisions they made is simply beyond me but I guess it was just a different time with different social norms and since the real selling points of the movie (the Gershwins music and Gene Kelly's screen presence) needed the plot to go a certain way in order to do their thing, it just did and all told, that's fine with me. If it wasn't for Gene Kelly and the Gershwins, this movie would have been a non-starter but with their immeasurable talent, it is a movie worth watching. Leslie Caron as a leading lady was an epic fail but I'm sure a lot of the blame for that lies in the story itself. It cannot be easy to play a lady who switches from angrily saying "You are downright annoying!" to giggling and agreeing to meet for a date a split second later because he refused to take no for an answer. But that's just my two scents. ;)

    Jerry Mulligan (Gene Kelly) is a struggling American painter who quit his job in the army to pursue his passion in the sizzling Paris. His good friend includes Adam Cook (Oscar Levant) an unknown pianist who lives in an apartment nearby. Adam introduces Jerry to Henri Baurel (Georges Guetary) a popular local crooner, who is to marry a 'vivacious, modern, enchanting, fascinating, exciting, sweet, shy and scholarly' dancer Lise ( Jerry does not know about this, however). Jerry puts his landscape paintings on display along the brick walls in the streets of Paris, and makes a paltry living out of it. His character is somewhat nasty, but many struggling street artists whom I have met are actually nasty with their take-it-or-leave attitude. He meets Milo (Nina Foch) a middle-aged rich woman who takes fancy to his paintings and agrees to buy two of his works. However, it can be observed here how Milo is actually trying to woo Jerry, as she tells Jerry that she does not have enough money and invites him to her hotel room. Madonna of the 50s, I say! Jerry does not respond well to her advances and starts flirting unabashedly with a young girl at the pub aka Lise. Jerry gets her number and almost prowls her to fall in love with him, which she eventually does. Conversely, Lise sets out more traps for Jerry. The rest is well. obvious. The Oscar and Golden Globes Associations have infamously awarded lesser deserving films, actors, actresses, supporting actors, supporting actresses, documentaries, music, screenplay. For example, Sandra Bullock's tough white compassionate mother act that paled even in comparison to a similar tough mom act by Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich. Or take the complete failure of recognition of 1952s 'Singin' in The Rain', a definitive musical masterpiece also starring Gene Kelly, and my personal choice for the greatest film of the 20th century. But to see 'An American in Paris' win Best Picture and Best Screenplay (!!!) is an unexpected and somewhat sour surprise. Why? Because An American in Paris is an incomplete film, lacking a thorough script, thin of memorable songs and dance sequences, short of convincing performances and devoid of a proper conclusion. How can this be rewarded the best script when the last twenty minutes did not receive enough momentum from the first ninety minutes, thus making the entire attempt somewhat flat? Gene Kelly's larger-than-life, showy persona proved an advantage in 'SITR' but here, where he has to downplay his character, it militates his likability. Also, his treatment of Jean Hagen's Lena Lamont in SITR was correct because of Lena's demanding diva personality. But to behave in the same way with Milo in AAIP made him a bit of a cad, especially when he drops her like a brick in the end without even considering her feelings for once, that too when he was acting in the same fashion albeit to woo Lise. He also has this slightly putting off habit of acting and moving in an affected way that is paradoxical to his role. Watch the first scene where he gets up fully aware that there is a camera in front of him, and then performs various movements in a rehearsed fashion. Works well at times, especially during the sing and dance numbers but lacks trueness otherwise. Hard to blame him though, since many actors 'act' this way. Leslie Caron does not live up to all the qualities mentioned about her by Henri. She seems shy, somewhat traditional and even reticent, like Talia Shire's character in Rocky. It is only when she dances that there comes some personality in her. But she still does not have the desired screen presence during the numbers, and cannot stand out when performing in a group. Also her chemistry with Gene is often bland and one-sided; Gene at least manages to show some fondness towards her while Leslie looks as if she is just playing along with him. Henri can sing well and act charmingly, but his character too is poorly given the chauffeur/dad-who-opposes-then-concedes treatment. They could have had some dialog between Henri and Lise, since love can't be so easily given up. And don't get me started on the ridiculous superhero-like costumes both Gene and Henri were wearing in the otherwise serious scene before the final performance! Oscar Levant was utterly wasted; he had a promising back-story or whatever you call it. They could have especially done more after his daydreaming concert act to draw attention upon his unfulfilled desires of becoming famous before the party scene. Oscar Levant, like many other actors, just parrots his lines without adding any gravity to it. Nina Foch was the only actor truly worth mentioning here; she conveys her dry charm, furtiveness and ultimately disappointment well. All of the songs are melodious but not catchy. However, they have the French charm that gives fervor to the movie. Even 'My Fair Lady' had fabulous numbers but I cannot remember any; it is because unlike Singing in the Rain or Marry Poppins or Sound of Music, they don't carry indelible hooks. So it isn't a fault, just a lacking. But the fault was to place all these numbers in this film; they failed to add up and boost the finale. Conversely, SITR placed its numbers so well that the 12 minute Broadway Melody spectacle at the end was just dazzling. I have to commend the unique filming techniques in the film: Lise could not be described more wonderfully, the one-man band was clever and the theatrical finishing was ingenious. The performances, especially the one between Kelly and Guetary brought a smile to my face. But the movie itself disappointed me; it seems like a beta version when compared to Singing in the Rain, but as a standalone, it was underwhelming. My Rating: 5.5 out of 10

    Take an accomplished director, one of the world's most famous dancers, a dreamily romantic setting and music from none other than George Gershwin and what do you have? In the case of An American in Paris, you have a film which, for me, falls flat on its face. The winning combination of talent and reputation thrilled the critics, back in 1951 and the film was showered with awards including six Oscars. But, looked at coldly and in retrospect, it's difficult to understand why . Right from the opening scene, when Gene Kelly  who is supposed to be starving in a Paris garret  wakes up looking prosperous, over-confident and heavily made-up, you can already hear the turkey feathers starting to rustle. The story falters and bumbles its way through yawning intervals which separate the big numbers and the characters become less convincing with every scene. Leslie Caron, when she finally turns up, looks terrified and toothy and though she dances superbly, seems too timid to bring magic to any of her scenes. She and Kelly dance pretty well together, technically, but without the slightest sense of partnership. Watching them, I got the impression that each would rather have been somewhere else. The music, despite such great numbers, seems to have been shoe-horned into the narrative and often, doesn't fit. The scene where Gershwin's rattlingly wonderful Concerto in F is performed, for instance, has nothing to do with anything else in the film. It does, however, provide moments of sweet relief from the limping story and embarrassingly stilted scenes. It's hard to believe that Oklahoma was released only four years later, in 1955 and yet, seems to belong to a different era. Oklahoma succeeds in every respect where An American in Paris fails. The acting is convincing, the story works well, the casting is faultless, the choreography - apart from the disappointing dream sequence - is sublime. But above all, the characters in Oklahoma perform with zest and sparkle in overdrive. That makes the film overflow with a sense of freshness, excitement and overflowing 'joy de vivre'. What a difference!

    After service in World War II, singer-dancer and struggling painter Gene Kelly (as Jerry Mulligan) settles on the Left Bank of Paris. His handsome features attract heiress Nina Foch (as Milo Roberts) and Mr. Kelly quickly becomes her escort. While out nightclubbing with his sponsor, Kelly sets he his sights on pretty young Leslie Caron (as Lise Bouvier). However, she is seeing local entertainer Georges Guetary (as Henri Baurel). Another American in Paris, pianist Oscar Levant (as Adam Cook), connects the lovers. Outstanding singing, dancing, impressions and setting in a too long and flimsy story; the art remains. ******** An American in Paris (8/26/51) Vincente Minnelli ~ Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant, Georges Guetary

    Fans of the movie genres known as "Musical", "Classic", and "Romance" and pure true lovers, lend me your ear. If you looking for the perfect romance musical, then the Oscar-winning "An American in Paris" is really the right movie for you. From the first minute, you, fellow viewer and reader, has been transformed into a cinematic world of lavishing color, enchanting magic and endless delights. After the end, even the whole movie stays with you for long as you can remember. This is the story of Jerry Mulligan {Gene Kelly}, a former American GI living in Paris making paintings and making friends with pianist Adam Cook {Oscar Levant} and singer Henri Baurel {Georges Guetary}. He soon finds love in the form of Lise Bouvier {Leslie Caron}, but soon romantic problems develop and Lise is not sure of what to do with her future with Jerry. This is one of the most delicious and most shining musicals around, and the superb score and choreography shows why this film feels not really dated. George and Ira Gershwin has mastered a genius of a lovely score right here, filled with so much many hummable songs such as "I Got Rhythm", "Our Love is Here to Stay", "Stairway to Paradise" and so much more. This is really and truly better than most of the music we have today. The choreography by Kelly is and truly a revelation. The most memorable of these, the ballet in the end, is one of the most ingenious and wondrous musical numbers we have ever seen in the history of the American musical. Kelly gives an everyday guy persona to Jerry. Once he becomes a character, we stay with him that way. The way he acts, the way he really dances, the way he sings, he really is a different type of a character. Caron really delivers in her first film role as Lise. She gives a lighting spark of radiance and power to the character. The moments that Kelly and Caron are together, the heart of romance goes aflutter and the viewer suddenly has gone love struck, rooting for them all the way. Even the supporting cast is feeling the magic as we speak. Levant is very funny and sensational. He delivers the film's comic moment when he conducts his own orchestra performing his own piece in a hilarious dream. Guetary is all dapper and gay. He is truly a wonder performing "Stairway to Paradise". Nina Foch also delivers as Jerry's society friend, Milo. She delivers one of the film's best one liners when waiting for a date with Jerry and another girl, Jerry asks "Who is the other girl?" Milo says "Me." Vincente Minnelli delivers a fantastic film here. Alan Jay Lerner's script is nothing short of delightful. The costumes and the sets by Orry-Kelly, Preston Kelly and Cedric Gibbons, respectively, are full of splendor and life. This is really a magnificent and can't miss film to watch not just by yourself, but for the whole entire family, even your pet. Rarely has a musical felt so much lovely and perfectly as this. My Pick: Green Light {See It}

    The story is surprisingly intense and actually eclipses the dancing sequences which are impressive. As much as the movies's plot may seem hokey and contrived, it really isn't. The story is plausible; people can fall in love immediately and get swept up in their emotions. Gene Kelly gives a great performance as an expatriate American and Leslie Caron proves to be dynamic in her role. The final dance sequence is incredible, combining several different dance forms. What makes this movie even stronger is that the story is simple, the characters likable and the music outstanding. The dream sequence with Oscar Levant was brilliant. There is nothing wrong with an upbeat movie featuring wonderfully talented actors who actually entertain. They sing, they dance, there is music and a happy ending. What's wrong with that? Nothing. This movie deserved the honors it received. Street Car and A Place in the Sun were marvelous movies, but a quality musical will trump a bleak, black-and-white drama anytime, like it did in 1951. Who would an audience rather watch: Gene Kelly laughing and dancing with Leslie Caron to the music of George Gershwin or gloomy Montgomery Clift plotting to kill a hapless Shelly Winters?

    I'e been a huge fan of "Singin' in the Rain" for quite some time now. I loved the songs, costumes, story, and actors in that one. I had heard of AAIP for a while, too. I've heard it was spectacular and decided to give it a whirl. It's not the worst I've ever seen, oh no. But definitely one of the most disappointing movies I've seen. First of all, Gene Kelly wasn't my favorite in SITR (I prefer Donald O'Connor). But I still thought he was alright. But he wasn't nearly as good in AAIP. His singing is okay here and there. But he doesn't do anything that makes me stare with wide eyes. I've always thought he was overrated. Not bad. But definitely overrated. And I didn't like his character much in this one, either. Also, his chemistry with Leslie Caron is not very believable, in my opinion. Speaking of Leslie, this was her first film. So I understand how she might be uncomfortable. But, am I the only one who doesn't think she's that pretty in this one? I thought she was fabulous in "Gigi" (1958). She was gorgeous and very talented in that one. But this one, she was missing something. But it was fun to watch her dance on pointe. Kelly's pal, Oscar Levant, is supposed to be the comic relief. Well, he wasn't at all comical, or at all a relief, for that matter. I loved his piano playing and I hope to be as good as him someday. But he was about as humorous as a brick and not a good actor, either. If you want a real good Gene Kelly pal, watch Donald O'Connor in SITR. He's actually funny and talented in many ways. So, I only gave this a 5 because of Levant's piano playing (which was magnificent), Kelly's "I Got Rhythmn" number with the little kids (but I do still prefer Judy Garland's version of the song), and the ballet at the end. As much as I love SITR, it's ballet was not as exciting. I did like the ballet in AAIP very much. So, all in all, it's a so-so movie. If you like that sort of thing, go ahead and watch it. But I'm warning you. You'd be much better off with watching "Singin' in the Rain".

    Movie musicals aren't my strong suit, but most of the time when I see one it manages to be entertaining enough. Gene Kelly has a way of making all of his dance moves seem effortlessly easy, and watching Leslie Caron keep in step with him is one of the highlights of the film. I wasn't too crazy about the romantic entanglements in the story, as Jerry Mulligan (Kelly) seemed better suited to end up with his sponsor Milo Roberts (Nina Foch); while Caron's character didn't seem to be a match for either Jerry or her fianc&eacute;e. I never could quite understand how a jilted lover, in this case Henri (Georges Guetary), manages to be so gallant in the end when his girlfriend goes off with another man. The main attraction here is the song and dance. Kelly is fun to watch in every one of his numbers, and the sequence featuring his pianist buddy Adam (Oscar Levant) was fairly innovative and entertaining. I got a kick out of the way Levant reacted to Henri's counsel for Jerry in matters of love and romance. Even though the picture relied heavily on extravagant use of color, it was interesting to see the gala black and white Mardi Gras style party in costumed splendor. As befitting the title of the picture, a couple more of the lavish dance sequences relied heavily on red, white and blue, an appropriate statement considering Kelly's character an ex-GI. This film made AFI's original Top 100 Movies of all time in 1997, but dropped off a decade later when the listing was revised in 2007. Considering it's competition for the Best Picture Oscar in 1952, namely "A Streetcar Named Desire" and "A Place in the Sun", it's curious to me how this one would have taken top honors, but I've stopped fretting about these things a long time ago. For my money, I'll take Kelly's follow up a year later, "Singin' in the Rain", but if you're a fan of movie musicals, there's enough entertainment value in both to keep one satisfied.

    Jerry Mulligan is a struggling American artist in Paris, he gets coveted by a rich heiress who can help his struggling career. However, a visit to a night club and a meeting with a delicate young, but spoken for, French girl, leads him into a battle with himself. Winner of seven Academy Awards, An American In Paris is of course a delightful and breezy picture from the MGM vault. Said to be the personal favourite movie of Gene Kelly, it boasts wonderful tunes from George & Ira Gershwin, brilliant art direction from Cedric Gibbons, vivid Technicolor that fills the eyes, and quite stunning choreography from Gene Kelly. The film, all told, is high on production value and entertaining enough from start to finish. Yet the film's plot is showing definite age problems now, and it also lacks the ode to joy sense of purpose that, for example, Singing In The Rain has. I also feel it's a missed opportunity to actually film the picture entirely on location in Paris instead of on the MGM lot, because a bit of earthy core feels missing from the unfolding story. Leslie Caron as the love rival to the smokingly hot older woman played by Nina Foch, is majestic dance wise, but acting she's very staid, and this too is an irritation. However, I still adore this film very much, just not as much as Gene and the Academy did, apparently! Come the grand finale it's hard to be too critical when so much energy and deftness of feet has been constructed for our entertainment. With such a production it's suffice to say that now, with all the technological advances made in home entertainment, An American in Paris is an High Definition essential. 7/10

    This is a film, I've found, about which nobody can ever be persuaded. It's too much an example of its various genres (musical, dance-fest, inevitable romance, exotic setting) to ever transcend them. That locks one's reaction to this undeniable classic of the studio system  "Made in Hollywood, U.S.A.," indeed  into whether one likes those genres. If you love any or all of George (and Ira) Gershwin's work, intricate choreography, ballet taken to literally Impressionistic heights, Paris long-shots (yes, the second unit did go there, it wasn't all done in Culver City), and happy endings, you'll dote on this film. If you can't stand plots that mainly tie musical performances together, actors who are chosen for dance or singing talent more than thespian skills, or back-lot artifice (yes, the brilliant 17-minute ballet at the end is the ultimate example), you won't see it twice. That makes one smoothly written appraisal difficult. It's full of elements popping up from each genre. It's the studio system at its most and least successful. (Not "worst." Nothing with the Gershwins' work can EVER be a "worst.") So I'll jump in to defend several elements against some strong criticisms. Some of this depends on remembering the elephant on those "Parisian" streets: There'd been a war on. ~ Gene Kelly (Jerry Mulligan): He's frequently derided as too old, either in absolute terms or relative to the rest of the cast. Not at all! Exuberant skill undercuts his physical age by at least 15 years here. It also makes Jerry's pursuit of Lise far more plausible. I'm sorry, but it's just not "stalking," then or now. It's elegantly converted from machismo, the kind that many women have complained about when seeing it ... and even more when they don't see it. Nor is Kelly so overambitious as to fit uncomfortably in a penniless-painter role, as some have said. It's too easy to forget that Jerry's been in Paris since the Second World War ended. That tore spirits or bodies apart for nearly all the Americans who fought in it, sooner or later, partly from most being forced into a crusader role they didn't want. This G.I. could need a few years to reawaken his capacity for talented work and fervent love. ~ Leslie Caron (Lise): She didn't show earnest or assertive acting until "Gigi," true enough. She was a brilliant dancing partner for Kelly, and not much more. (Those eyes and that smile, though, were to die for even at that age.) Yet consider Lise's back story, such as it is  losing her parents, Resistance fighters, before adolescence, and growing up with mentors instead. Wouldn't that have made her less confident about what the world would bring to her? She, as well as Mulligan, blossoms slowly after a dry spell. ~ Georges Gu&eacute;tary (Henri): He's the grounded contrast to Jerry's shallower-rooted American. His confidence and resilience aren't at all overblown. He's had a performing career and he's sticking to making the most of it, which will include Lise if it can, but will ultimately go on without her if it must. This boulevardier has a quiet persistence that isn't immediately evident. ~ Oscar Levant (Adam): No, he is not at all superfluous to the story, nor to the romantic entanglements. Just look at the scene in the caf&eacute; where he's sitting between Henri and Jerry, and only he knows that the others love the same girl. His frantic reactions, when the men unknowingly talk about the same object of affection, show priceless comic timing and subtly discharge any over-emotion. Levant was a brilliant pianist, and this friend of the composer had to have a Gershwin showcase. (The last movement of the "Concerto in F," where he's imagining himself also as orchestra, conductor, and audience.) Yet he's not a survivor, as Jerry and Lise are, and he's not above it all, as Henri is. He has unfulfilled ambition and imagination, yet stays involved enough in life to appreciate enthusiasm and stay connected to friends. His deflation of Jerry's sponsor at the end is not just a bon mot, but an act of loyalty. ~ Nina Foch (Milo): Okay, she's a bit too young and beautiful to be entirely convincing as Jerry's older patron. Yet she has the most acting skills of any of the main characters, and she takes a thankless position in the story and makes it both dignified and funny. Her possessiveness about Jerry is understandable and is offset by considerable good humor and charm. She has ambitions, romantic and otherwise, but she's not insincere about them, as out-sized as they may be. Milo's rising interest and final withdrawal are both quietly skilled and acted out in a minimum of screen time. ~ The plot: Yes, it mainly ties the music together and compresses events to make room. Yes, at times it makes Jerry too persistent, Adam too acerbic, Milo too grasping, Lise too unquestioning, Henri too accepting. Yet it remains remarkable for making so many genres work together at all! Alan Jay Lerner knew it was just functional (Oscar notwithstanding). It was meant to turn an artistic salad, with Gershwin lettuce, into a tasty meal for the viewer, and it more than succeeded in doing so. ... So is this, even for a lover of the Gershwins' music, anywhere near perfect? It comes very close. The plot more than exceeds the burdens put upon it, but it still has little resonance, so I take away one star. Yet the actors rise to their situations and show their strengths beautifully. It really comes down to one truth, as a lyric says: "Our love is here to stay." Not necessarily for the studio confectionery, or the mannered acting, or the utility plot. But for the incomparable Gershwins, and for what could be so ably strung upon their brilliance.

    I watched this movie 59 years after it was released (God bless technology) and what struck me most was the difference in the culture. The love connection that drives the story is created when he literally stalks her until she laughingly concedes after which point, their love is assumed as a given. And for the "other guy" to deliver his cheating fianc&eacute;e to him at the end of the movie WITH A SMILE(!!??!!) is so far beyond ridiculous, I'm not even sure I saw it right. There were other instances but I think I've made my point. I don't think the story was intended to be the real draw here. At least I hope not. The music and dancing were so good (Gene Kelly has more charm and charisma in any single scene than most Hollywood studios can dream of cramming into their products these days), that despite the story line and the relationships portrayed being mind-boggling, the movie is fun and engaging. What motivated the characters to make some of the decisions they made is simply beyond me but I guess it was just a different time with different social norms and since the real selling points of the movie (the Gershwins music and Gene Kelly's screen presence) needed the plot to go a certain way in order to do their thing, it just did and all told, that's fine with me. If it wasn't for Gene Kelly and the Gershwins, this movie would have been a non-starter but with their immeasurable talent, it is a movie worth watching. Leslie Caron as a leading lady was an epic fail but I'm sure a lot of the blame for that lies in the story itself. It cannot be easy to play a lady who switches from angrily saying "You are downright annoying!" to giggling and agreeing to meet for a date a split second later because he refused to take no for an answer. But that's just my two scents. ;)
