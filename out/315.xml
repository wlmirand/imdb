    Apt Pupil is a simple story about a disturbed teenage boy living in urban Los Angeles. When he discovers that a neighbor of his is a war criminal who used to run a Nazi concentration camp, he can't resist blackmailing the poor old man. However as the film develops the old man begins to turn the tables on the boy and starts blackmailing him instead. A sort of psychological game develops between the two and along with it, an odd, scary friendship. Apt Pupil was originally written by Stephen King but in my opinion, the film is superior to the novel, which I feel is excessively violent and gratuitous in how it described rape, torture, murder and killing sprees. The novel may have done a better job of describing a psychotic mind, but Apt Pupil goes to the trouble of developing said mind and showing how a child loses his innocence and deteriorates into this sociopathic shell. I also like how the film portrayed Dussander as a sympathetic character at first, although I felt the book did that aspect better. Dussander is ashamed of himself for what he has done but as the film goes on, his mind, too, starts to lose itself and he starts to embrace nazism. This film itself is just plain scary in its depiction of human nature and what we're all capable of. Apt Pupil won't be liked by many because it requires an attention span, a tolerance of disturbing and dark material, and an imagination to appreciate. People who dislike this film are missing the point. It's a wonderful story of a partnership between two individuals who each have their demons that they must face, along with some deadly secrets that could cripple their existence. This film is spellbinding and dazzling. If you can take what it dishes out, you will love it. If you have a faint heart, go watch something else. But if you want to learn how two men blackmail each other and how ultimately their plan fails, watch this movie for the psychology of it. The direction by Bryan Singer is superb and the camera-work creates some of the most powerful and tragic scenes in recent memory. The part where the man in the hospital recognizes Dussander is gut-wrenching alone. This is an amazing film. If you want to look into the darkness inside yourself, watch this movie, and then contemplate it. You'd be surprised what you are capable of.

    There have been many films and books that attempt to explain the horror that we humans are capable of. While I haven't read the Stephen King nouvelle "Apt Pupil", I can tell you this film adaptation kept my attention and threw out some new ideas I hadn't really considered. If you haven't already seen it, search for the Stanley Milgram experiment. It was a psychological test done by a Yale student back in the 1960s offering one of the most chilling explanations for the phenomenon of Nazism, a convincing illustration of how humans can do horrific things. The gist is that we convince ourselves that we're doing what we're supposed to be doing ("just following orders" or "everyone told me to do it"). The video is online on dailymotion. "Apt Pupil" surprised me by taking a very different approach which I won't ruin for you. I'll just say that it weaves a complex Machiavellian scheme, where evil is deliberate and conscious of itself. It finds its footing by creating a balance of power, reminiscent of the "mutual assured destruction" philosophy in the 80s that led the USA and Russia to stockpile enough nukes to send us to the Smurf universe. OK, enough background. Let's talk about the film already. If the premise doesn't capture you instantly, the impressive directing and musical score should suck you in with its heavy, foreboding mood. Ian McKellan (probably best known as Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings but also an accomplished Shakespearean actor) is excellent in the role of an ex- Nazi... a menacing enigma somewhere between a serial killer and a cranky grandfather. Brad Renfro appears on screen as the perfect na&iuml;ve kid with a perpetual deer-in-the- headlights expression, sort of like John Cusack in the 80s but without the laughs. The film focuses mainly on the transformation of Renfro's character. It's here where I was unconvinced, and I docked the film a point or 2. Renfro's character mutates so suddenly and drastically you'd think he sucked down some radioactive sludge. I feel a lot of his "experiments with evil" were uncharacteristic and thrown in for shock value. No matter how curious a person is, nobody goes from Pollyanna to animal mutilations in just a month or two. It was this seemingly random, inexplicable moral decay which I felt was just injected for cheap shock value. If you can get past that, the real theme emerges. The root of human evil, according to "Apt Pupil," is not random moral decay but actually a complex struggle for power. When this theme emerged in the latter half, that's when I perked up and paid attention. The story then takes on a suspenseful air, and the kid & the Nazi get into an interesting game of cat & mouse. Overall, I'll stick with the Stanley Milgram experiment for the most convincing explanation of human atrocities. But "Apt Pupil" definitely delivers some food for thought. Another film that provides insight is the criminally underrated "Exorcist III" with George C. Scott and Brad Dourif playing mind games in an insane asylum. Also check out the documentary "Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer," or on the lighter side, "Dr. Strangelove" makes an interesting commentary on why humans commit genocide. Who knows why humans kill, maim and torture. But as long as we keep investigating there may be hope for us.

    a Stephen King adaptation. good basis and seductive invitation for public. and the film is really correct work. tension, performance, levels of darkness. only problem - its message is too obvious. the story desires tell everything. and that everything is great cage for actors and viewer. because the powerful colors has not nuances. and the fight with shadows is a little delicate. but, it is a good film. that fact is not a surprise - Ian McKellen is great at all and Brad Renfro makes the best for his character - but it is something strange and confuse, unrealistic and forced. but the error must be novel author sin. short - a movie about evil. like a mirror almost clear.

    "Apt Pupil" refers to a teen (Todd) played by Brad Renfro, who discovers that a neighbor (Kurt Dussander) was a Nazi at several death camps. Todd becomes the apt pupil of Dussander. In one parallel, Dussander attempts to kill a cat, while Todd kills a pigeon. At the end, Todd threatens a guidance counselor who may expose his misbehavior, using the same threats that Dussander eventually used on him. And in the most direct parallel, Dussander thinks he has killed a man who knows about him, but Todd finishes off the man brutally. Subsequently, Dussander reflects back on the boy the same question asked of him as to how this felt. Todd's evil side blossoms as he exercises his domination over Dussander. Todd is the apt pupil, but he comes to it primed already. Dussander is like a reflecting mirror, and the more that Todd looks into this mirror, the more he becomes the Nazi character that he is seeing there. The story is unusual. Todd is a bright teen who discovers that Dussander was at the camps killing Jews. Instead of turning him in, he blackmails him. He threatens him with revealing his identity if he will only tell him stories of the death and how he felt about what he did. This is not through any kind of conscience or attempt at punishing the old man, played by Ian McKellen. Rather, the boy is fascinated by the evil and seems to want to participate and find out how it feels. As the story proceeds, Todd more and more gets drawn into evil behavior. The old man, humiliated and made to wear an old Nazi uniform, manages to turn the tables on the boy who then, toward the end of the story, scrambles to extricate himself. He succeeds, but not before having damaged his own character, or brought out its evil side so thoroughly, that there will be no going back.

    Between the making of The Usual Suspects and X-Men Bryan Singer made a small psychological thriller based on the Stephen King novella Apt Pupil. This was a story with a interesting premise but an uneven execution. In California town in 1984 Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a straight A-Level student and at the age of 16 he is already a High School student. When studying the Holocaust he discovers one of his neighbours, Arthur Denker (Ian McKellen) is actually a SS death camp commander and a wanted war criminal. Instead of telling the police Todd blackmails Denker to tell him stories about the Holocaust. Both character slowly end up playing mind games and powerplays with each other and awakening their darks demons within them. The basic idea had a lot of a potential and there were many different directions it could have gone. It could have been the boy finds out about the war criminal and the turns into an examination of the nature of guilt and evil, explore who is really the evil one in the relationship, a look a modern Nazism. The other way it could have gone is the boy could found the secret and does not know where to turn or finds its out the secret after befriending the man. The direction Apt Pupil starred off well enough as it better of wits between Todd and Denker but it slowly turns into more of a horror movie as both characters start to display the behaviour of emerging serial killers. It felt like this was a film wanting to be a thriller and horror more the being a more in depth study which it should have been and what Singer is more than capable of. It was the screenplay that lets the film down with forced moments (i.e. how Denker was discovered by the authorities) to some unrealistic character development. Renfro was a very stiff actor in the lead role and was a truly unlikeable character to lead the film. There was no real charm to him nor the charisma that a character like that needed to make you to make you care about what happened to him. But we were luckily were compensated with an excellent and dark performance from McKellen, playing a character who wants a quiet life and forced to relive his memories and by doing this his old dark and sadistic side. Singer is of course a talented director and he does bring some moments of visual flair involving dreams. There are some creepy looking scenes and the one where Todd was in the shower, the camera pans and changes filter was very well. The pacing is right throughout, Singer and his editor new when to speed up or slow down when needed and the scenes between Todd and Denker were filled with tension. A knife could have cut it as the two men tried to best the other one. There are themes about obsession, violence and the dark nature of humanity. A particular idea that was well done was how people can dream and be interest of violence and the darker elements of life but very different when actually confronted with it. Apt Pupil is the weakest film from Singer's filmography I have seen but it still a well made and compelling film. What lets it down is the weak script that was provided and it was really just a small film for Singer to keep himself busy before he got the X-Men gig (which I am thankful for).

    They take so many of Steven Kings many best sellers and turn them into movies. For the most part they miss the mark by a longshot with only around three exceptions maybe 5 depending on who you ask these include The Shining, Stand by Me, and the Shawshank Redemtion. Most of his books tuned into movies are terrible and this is one of those. The acting is alright but its nothing like the book at all. The book was very disturbing while this is not in the least disturbing. The story line is not even kept the same. It was the biggest disappointment since "IT" you should only really watch this if you have not read the book but then again Id just say read the book. This movie is about a young boy who finds out one of the elderly men in his neighbourhood is actually a Nazi war criminal. He ends up blackmailing him into telling him the horrors of the Nazi death camps because the kid has a sick obsession with it. He thinks he has all the control over the old man but the old has his tricks. Like I said this movie is no where near as good as the book. If you want a really intense disturbing book read it stay away from the movie unless there is no chance you will ever read the book.

    In the late 1990's there was a small resurgence in interest in the work of Stephen King, who had been popularised in the 1970's and '80's as the prime horror author. What was slightly more interesting about this late reprisal, was that the stories were not directly linked to the horror genre, and led to one of the most loved films of the 1990's, The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Whilst this film did not do well in the cinemas, it made it's impact on video, and therefore the more dramatic, cerebral and often realistic King adaptation's were given the green light. Hot off the success of 1995's The Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer was brought in to direct this story of power over other humans, and the devastation this can cause. Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a top student in his high-school, and the film opens on a closing class focusing on the holocaust. The subject has clearly opened up something in the young man. Being convinced that there is an ex-Nazi officer living secretly in his neighbourhood, he decides to pay the man, Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellen), a visit. What transpires is that Todd had collected research on the subject, and uses this to blackmail Kurt into revisiting and verbalising his war stories, with particularly macabre focus on the killing of Jews. As the relationship between the two progresses it becomes clear that what fascinates Todd the most, is the power that was exerted over a people, and he has a hunger to know what this power is like. This begins with his power over Kurt; he revels in a display of power after he purchases a Nazi uniform for Kurt and makes him march on the spot. However the power that Todd exposes, is also resurfaced in the very isolated old man. Well, as this is a Stephen King adaptation, the film obviously leads to murder. But the main theme of the film is the abuses of power, and the corrupting nature of power over others. It's a very interesting film, and Singer's direction is spot on. Seeing this now also highlights the loss of a very promising actor, Brad Renfro, who unfortunately died of a drug overdose in 2008. However, without any doubt this is McKellen's film. He is note perfect for this ageing, lonely man, who has had to live with his knowledge of the concentration camps for many years. The film does tend to lose it's effect at times, and falls into a clich&eacute;d trap; for example, after Kurt has attempted to kill a homeless guy, but has to get the young Todd to finish the job after suffering a heart attack, Todd repeatedly hits the tramp with a shovel - a jump moment proceeds as the tramp gets back up after 'being killed' - yawn. However, this seems mainly to be the fault of the narrative, and is easy to overcome, particularly with the two fine central performances. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Sadly whatever made the novel good is lacking in this adaptation. Apt Pupil is a movie that feels like a new director took over every five minutes with a different idea of where the movie should go. It creates a vortex that sucks up any chance at emotional connection to the characters or overall film. What little plot there is gets rushed. There are several times when the film is too lazy or simply incapable of properly showing passages of time so it simply cuts to black 'X weeks/months later..' screens. Poor editing destroys any chance to introspect on the conversations between Kurt and Todd. One moment Kurt will be describing Holocaust victims defecating on themselves in the gas chamber and then abruptly a basketball is on screen and Todd is at school in gym class. Then a moment later his friend is talking about dates and parties in the locker-room. The on screen chemistry between Kurt and Todd is that of a wet paper-towel. The characterizations feel wrong and not in an interesting way. Think of an adult being scared of a baby. That's basically what you get. Kurt, a former SS officer who worked in both Bergen-Belsen and the notorious Auschwitz camp shrinks constantly away at Todd who is nothing but an angsty spoiled emo teenager. The movie would've been far better served with a more aggressive stance from Kurt, especially when the movie is attempting to show how evil and 'badass' the Nazis were. Even without any sort of chemistry and with Kurt being blackmailed and forced to dress up for Todd, he abruptly takes a shine to him ala Miyagi style and impersonates being his Grandfather to the guidance counsellor and the movie shifts into Todd's school life and trying to get his grades up. Then it shifts back to them hating each other. Then abruptly Kurt, who is a wanted fugitive who has intelligently and carefully concealed his identity for decades and lived a law-abiding life in the US decides to stab someone. None of it makes much sense and we care even less to figure out why because he doesn't like Todd and Todd seems to be a blossoming sociopath who doesn't like anyone except himself. Ultimately I feel like what I watched was a boy's masturbatory fantasy about having his own private SS officer to dress up, interrogate and harass mixed in with odd and boring clips of teenage high school angst. Not good for a movie that bills itself to be basically a Nazi thriller.

    'The Usual Suspects' is one of my favorite films, and 'Apt Pupil' is the closest that Bryan Singer has ever come to recreating the atmosphere and intensity of his prior work. 'Pupil' is a very flawed film, but still an entertaining and insightful one. I haven't read the Stephen King novella which it is based upon for quite some time, so I don't recall all of the differences between the two works. Todd Bowden is a seemingly above average high school student. In 1984, he is a sixteen year old high school senior who is also a star pitcher for his school's baseball team. Basically he is the kind of kid that every parent wishes they had, except that he has a hidden dark side. This dark side manifests itself in a morbid fascination with the horrific crimes against humanity that were committed by the third Reich. An uncredited Christopher McQuarrie opens the film with a fantastically written narration, asking whether the Nazis actions were the result of economic, cultural, or social influences. He then posits that it may simply have been human nature. On the bus home one night, Todd recognizes an old man named Kurt Dussander as one of the famous war criminals he has been obsessively studying. The look of recognition in actor Brad Renfro's eye as the camera pans in is subtly and fantastically depicted. Bowden goes to great lengths to ensure that he has the right man before he confronts him (to include analyzing fingerprints). Todd has no interest in turning the Dussander in; instead he blackmails him into giving detailed recollections of his grisly past. The movie slowly becomes a chess game between the two, and soon they are blackmailing each other. As Dussander warns, Todd is playing with fire. John Ottman's opening score was disappointing, but the rest of the music and his editing were top notch. The film's primary flaw is that ten minutes or so could have been edited out of the middle portion of the film. Elias Koteas is a great actor, but his scenes go on for far too long, to the point of undermining the suspense. Tighter editing could have made this a much more popular film in my opinion, because the performances are stunning. Most of the film consists of Ian McKellan and Brad Renfro's characters in Dussander's house, and to their credit they're always compelling. Two scenes stand out for me. One is the dinner table scene, where Dussander easily wins over Todd's entire family with effortless charm. The second is where Todd forces him to wear an SS officer's uniform procured from a costumer (Dussander wryly notes that he's been promoted when he sees the rank tabs). His gradual descent back into his former self is chilling and McKellan plays it perfectly. Brandon Boyce's script and Bryan Singer's direction are dead on, except as I already mentioned more editing was needed in the middle of the film. The last half hour was masterfully constructed, and although the ending departs from the novella I preferred it. I think it had a lot more substance and was more unnerving than King's sudden, shocker ending. Does the film rely on a two amazing coincidences (Todd recognizing Dussander, and the old man sharing a hospital room with Dussander)? You bet. Does it work? I think so. Overall it's a good film with some interesting suppositions about the nature of evil, and it's a shame that it faded into obscurity.

    The movie Apt Pupil begins with a slow, but definitely solid start. Our protagonist, Todd Bowen, is an honor student at his high school. His history teacher is teaching "holocaust week" and Todd becomes intrigued and heads off to the library after class for more information. On his bus ride home, he spots a man who looks familiar- a little too familiar. Todd recognizes him to be Kurt Dussander, a Nazi who is being hunted for various crimes he committed during the second world war. After collecting a lot of evidence proving that the man he spotted was indeed Kurt Dussander, Todd decides to confront him. He gives Dussander (who is living under the alias Arthur Denker) an ultimatum; tell me all about your involvement in the holocaust, or I turn you and all the evidence over to the police. Dussander agrees to share his stories with Todd, and thus was the beginning of a confederacy that was to lead both parties involved down a path of darkness. Ian McKellan gives an amazing performance as the sarcastic and witty Kurt Dussander. In my opinion, McKellan definitely carried the movie. He was totally convincing as the seventy-five year-old former Nazi, so much so that it was almost hard to imagine him as the same man who would later play as the vivacious villain Magneto of the X-men series, or the kindhearted and powerful wizard Gandalf of the Lord of the of the Rings. Brad Renfro gave a less thrilling performance as Todd Bowen, the highly intelligent protagonist with a shade for the sadistic. Renfro was too many sullen stares, bored smirks and petulant exclamations, and too little harsh resolve, but at moments he did shine. And perhaps his moody performance was somewhat appropriate to the character, a teenage boy entangled in something from which he could not escape. I cannot accurately draw a comparison between the book and the movie, having only seen the movie, but I can say that from what I've heard and read, the book and movie should be judged on their own merits. The movie isn't so much as an adaptation as much as almost a reinterpretation or retelling of the original story, and has a drastically different ending from the book. All in all I can say that I enjoyed the film- it didn't absolutely blow me away or have me eager to watch it a second time- but it was worth the paltry sum that I paid for it and maybe more.

The root of human evil, according to "Apt Pupil," is not random moral decay but actually a complex struggle for power. When this theme emerged in the latter half, that's when I perked up and paid attention. The story then takes on a suspenseful air, and the kid & the Nazi get into an interesting game of cat & mouse. Overall, I'll stick with the Stanley Milgram experiment for the most convincing explanation of human atrocities. But "Apt Pupil" definitely delivers some food for thought. Another film that provides insight is the criminally underrated "Exorcist III" with George C. Scott and Brad Dourif playing mind games in an insane asylum. Also check out the documentary "Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer," or on the lighter side, "Dr. Strangelove" makes an interesting commentary on why humans commit genocide. Who knows why humans kill, maim and torture. But as long as we keep investigating there may be hope for us.

    a Stephen King adaptation. good basis and seductive invitation for public. and the film is really correct work. tension, performance, levels of darkness. only problem - its message is too obvious. the story desires tell everything. and that everything is great cage for actors and viewer. because the powerful colors has not nuances. and the fight with shadows is a little delicate. but, it is a good film. that fact is not a surprise - Ian McKellen is great at all and Brad Renfro makes the best for his character - but it is something strange and confuse, unrealistic and forced. but the error must be novel author sin. short - a movie about evil. like a mirror almost clear.

    "Apt Pupil" refers to a teen (Todd) played by Brad Renfro, who discovers that a neighbor (Kurt Dussander) was a Nazi at several death camps. Todd becomes the apt pupil of Dussander. In one parallel, Dussander attempts to kill a cat, while Todd kills a pigeon. At the end, Todd threatens a guidance counselor who may expose his misbehavior, using the same threats that Dussander eventually used on him. And in the most direct parallel, Dussander thinks he has killed a man who knows about him, but Todd finishes off the man brutally. Subsequently, Dussander reflects back on the boy the same question asked of him as to how this felt. Todd's evil side blossoms as he exercises his domination over Dussander. Todd is the apt pupil, but he comes to it primed already. Dussander is like a reflecting mirror, and the more that Todd looks into this mirror, the more he becomes the Nazi character that he is seeing there. The story is unusual. Todd is a bright teen who discovers that Dussander was at the camps killing Jews. Instead of turning him in, he blackmails him. He threatens him with revealing his identity if he will only tell him stories of the death and how he felt about what he did. This is not through any kind of conscience or attempt at punishing the old man, played by Ian McKellen. Rather, the boy is fascinated by the evil and seems to want to participate and find out how it feels. As the story proceeds, Todd more and more gets drawn into evil behavior. The old man, humiliated and made to wear an old Nazi uniform, manages to turn the tables on the boy who then, toward the end of the story, scrambles to extricate himself. He succeeds, but not before having damaged his own character, or brought out its evil side so thoroughly, that there will be no going back.

    Between the making of The Usual Suspects and X-Men Bryan Singer made a small psychological thriller based on the Stephen King novella Apt Pupil. This was a story with a interesting premise but an uneven execution. In California town in 1984 Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a straight A-Level student and at the age of 16 he is already a High School student. When studying the Holocaust he discovers one of his neighbours, Arthur Denker (Ian McKellen) is actually a SS death camp commander and a wanted war criminal. Instead of telling the police Todd blackmails Denker to tell him stories about the Holocaust. Both character slowly end up playing mind games and powerplays with each other and awakening their darks demons within them. The basic idea had a lot of a potential and there were many different directions it could have gone. It could have been the boy finds out about the war criminal and the turns into an examination of the nature of guilt and evil, explore who is really the evil one in the relationship, a look a modern Nazism. The other way it could have gone is the boy could found the secret and does not know where to turn or finds its out the secret after befriending the man. The direction Apt Pupil starred off well enough as it better of wits between Todd and Denker but it slowly turns into more of a horror movie as both characters start to display the behaviour of emerging serial killers. It felt like this was a film wanting to be a thriller and horror more the being a more in depth study which it should have been and what Singer is more than capable of. It was the screenplay that lets the film down with forced moments (i.e. how Denker was discovered by the authorities) to some unrealistic character development. Renfro was a very stiff actor in the lead role and was a truly unlikeable character to lead the film. There was no real charm to him nor the charisma that a character like that needed to make you to make you care about what happened to him. But we were luckily were compensated with an excellent and dark performance from McKellen, playing a character who wants a quiet life and forced to relive his memories and by doing this his old dark and sadistic side. Singer is of course a talented director and he does bring some moments of visual flair involving dreams. There are some creepy looking scenes and the one where Todd was in the shower, the camera pans and changes filter was very well. The pacing is right throughout, Singer and his editor new when to speed up or slow down when needed and the scenes between Todd and Denker were filled with tension. A knife could have cut it as the two men tried to best the other one. There are themes about obsession, violence and the dark nature of humanity. A particular idea that was well done was how people can dream and be interest of violence and the darker elements of life but very different when actually confronted with it. Apt Pupil is the weakest film from Singer's filmography I have seen but it still a well made and compelling film. What lets it down is the weak script that was provided and it was really just a small film for Singer to keep himself busy before he got the X-Men gig (which I am thankful for).

    They take so many of Steven Kings many best sellers and turn them into movies. For the most part they miss the mark by a longshot with only around three exceptions maybe 5 depending on who you ask these include The Shining, Stand by Me, and the Shawshank Redemtion. Most of his books tuned into movies are terrible and this is one of those. The acting is alright but its nothing like the book at all. The book was very disturbing while this is not in the least disturbing. The story line is not even kept the same. It was the biggest disappointment since "IT" you should only really watch this if you have not read the book but then again Id just say read the book. This movie is about a young boy who finds out one of the elderly men in his neighbourhood is actually a Nazi war criminal. He ends up blackmailing him into telling him the horrors of the Nazi death camps because the kid has a sick obsession with it. He thinks he has all the control over the old man but the old has his tricks. Like I said this movie is no where near as good as the book. If you want a really intense disturbing book read it stay away from the movie unless there is no chance you will ever read the book.

    In the late 1990's there was a small resurgence in interest in the work of Stephen King, who had been popularised in the 1970's and '80's as the prime horror author. What was slightly more interesting about this late reprisal, was that the stories were not directly linked to the horror genre, and led to one of the most loved films of the 1990's, The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Whilst this film did not do well in the cinemas, it made it's impact on video, and therefore the more dramatic, cerebral and often realistic King adaptation's were given the green light. Hot off the success of 1995's The Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer was brought in to direct this story of power over other humans, and the devastation this can cause. Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a top student in his high-school, and the film opens on a closing class focusing on the holocaust. The subject has clearly opened up something in the young man. Being convinced that there is an ex-Nazi officer living secretly in his neighbourhood, he decides to pay the man, Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellen), a visit. What transpires is that Todd had collected research on the subject, and uses this to blackmail Kurt into revisiting and verbalising his war stories, with particularly macabre focus on the killing of Jews. As the relationship between the two progresses it becomes clear that what fascinates Todd the most, is the power that was exerted over a people, and he has a hunger to know what this power is like. This begins with his power over Kurt; he revels in a display of power after he purchases a Nazi uniform for Kurt and makes him march on the spot. However the power that Todd exposes, is also resurfaced in the very isolated old man. Well, as this is a Stephen King adaptation, the film obviously leads to murder. But the main theme of the film is the abuses of power, and the corrupting nature of power over others. It's a very interesting film, and Singer's direction is spot on. Seeing this now also highlights the loss of a very promising actor, Brad Renfro, who unfortunately died of a drug overdose in 2008. However, without any doubt this is McKellen's film. He is note perfect for this ageing, lonely man, who has had to live with his knowledge of the concentration camps for many years. The film does tend to lose it's effect at times, and falls into a clich&eacute;d trap; for example, after Kurt has attempted to kill a homeless guy, but has to get the young Todd to finish the job after suffering a heart attack, Todd repeatedly hits the tramp with a shovel - a jump moment proceeds as the tramp gets back up after 'being killed' - yawn. However, this seems mainly to be the fault of the narrative, and is easy to overcome, particularly with the two fine central performances. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Sadly whatever made the novel good is lacking in this adaptation. Apt Pupil is a movie that feels like a new director took over every five minutes with a different idea of where the movie should go. It creates a vortex that sucks up any chance at emotional connection to the characters or overall film. What little plot there is gets rushed. There are several times when the film is too lazy or simply incapable of properly showing passages of time so it simply cuts to black 'X weeks/months later..' screens. Poor editing destroys any chance to introspect on the conversations between Kurt and Todd. One moment Kurt will be describing Holocaust victims defecating on themselves in the gas chamber and then abruptly a basketball is on screen and Todd is at school in gym class. Then a moment later his friend is talking about dates and parties in the locker-room. The on screen chemistry between Kurt and Todd is that of a wet paper-towel. The characterizations feel wrong and not in an interesting way. Think of an adult being scared of a baby. That's basically what you get. Kurt, a former SS officer who worked in both Bergen-Belsen and the notorious Auschwitz camp shrinks constantly away at Todd who is nothing but an angsty spoiled emo teenager. The movie would've been far better served with a more aggressive stance from Kurt, especially when the movie is attempting to show how evil and 'badass' the Nazis were. Even without any sort of chemistry and with Kurt being blackmailed and forced to dress up for Todd, he abruptly takes a shine to him ala Miyagi style and impersonates being his Grandfather to the guidance counsellor and the movie shifts into Todd's school life and trying to get his grades up. Then it shifts back to them hating each other. Then abruptly Kurt, who is a wanted fugitive who has intelligently and carefully concealed his identity for decades and lived a law-abiding life in the US decides to stab someone. None of it makes much sense and we care even less to figure out why because he doesn't like Todd and Todd seems to be a blossoming sociopath who doesn't like anyone except himself. Ultimately I feel like what I watched was a boy's masturbatory fantasy about having his own private SS officer to dress up, interrogate and harass mixed in with odd and boring clips of teenage high school angst. Not good for a movie that bills itself to be basically a Nazi thriller.

    'The Usual Suspects' is one of my favorite films, and 'Apt Pupil' is the closest that Bryan Singer has ever come to recreating the atmosphere and intensity of his prior work. 'Pupil' is a very flawed film, but still an entertaining and insightful one. I haven't read the Stephen King novella which it is based upon for quite some time, so I don't recall all of the differences between the two works. Todd Bowden is a seemingly above average high school student. In 1984, he is a sixteen year old high school senior who is also a star pitcher for his school's baseball team. Basically he is the kind of kid that every parent wishes they had, except that he has a hidden dark side. This dark side manifests itself in a morbid fascination with the horrific crimes against humanity that were committed by the third Reich. An uncredited Christopher McQuarrie opens the film with a fantastically written narration, asking whether the Nazis actions were the result of economic, cultural, or social influences. He then posits that it may simply have been human nature. On the bus home one night, Todd recognizes an old man named Kurt Dussander as one of the famous war criminals he has been obsessively studying. The look of recognition in actor Brad Renfro's eye as the camera pans in is subtly and fantastically depicted. Bowden goes to great lengths to ensure that he has the right man before he confronts him (to include analyzing fingerprints). Todd has no interest in turning the Dussander in; instead he blackmails him into giving detailed recollections of his grisly past. The movie slowly becomes a chess game between the two, and soon they are blackmailing each other. As Dussander warns, Todd is playing with fire. John Ottman's opening score was disappointing, but the rest of the music and his editing were top notch. The film's primary flaw is that ten minutes or so could have been edited out of the middle portion of the film. Elias Koteas is a great actor, but his scenes go on for far too long, to the point of undermining the suspense. Tighter editing could have made this a much more popular film in my opinion, because the performances are stunning. Most of the film consists of Ian McKellan and Brad Renfro's characters in Dussander's house, and to their credit they're always compelling. Two scenes stand out for me. One is the dinner table scene, where Dussander easily wins over Todd's entire family with effortless charm. The second is where Todd forces him to wear an SS officer's uniform procured from a costumer (Dussander wryly notes that he's been promoted when he sees the rank tabs). His gradual descent back into his former self is chilling and McKellan plays it perfectly. Brandon Boyce's script and Bryan Singer's direction are dead on, except as I already mentioned more editing was needed in the middle of the film. The last half hour was masterfully constructed, and although the ending departs from the novella I preferred it. I think it had a lot more substance and was more unnerving than King's sudden, shocker ending. Does the film rely on a two amazing coincidences (Todd recognizing Dussander, and the old man sharing a hospital room with Dussander)? You bet. Does it work? I think so. Overall it's a good film with some interesting suppositions about the nature of evil, and it's a shame that it faded into obscurity.

    The movie Apt Pupil begins with a slow, but definitely solid start. Our protagonist, Todd Bowen, is an honor student at his high school. His history teacher is teaching "holocaust week" and Todd becomes intrigued and heads off to the library after class for more information. On his bus ride home, he spots a man who looks familiar- a little too familiar. Todd recognizes him to be Kurt Dussander, a Nazi who is being hunted for various crimes he committed during the second world war. After collecting a lot of evidence proving that the man he spotted was indeed Kurt Dussander, Todd decides to confront him. He gives Dussander (who is living under the alias Arthur Denker) an ultimatum; tell me all about your involvement in the holocaust, or I turn you and all the evidence over to the police. Dussander agrees to share his stories with Todd, and thus was the beginning of a confederacy that was to lead both parties involved down a path of darkness. Ian McKellan gives an amazing performance as the sarcastic and witty Kurt Dussander. In my opinion, McKellan definitely carried the movie. He was totally convincing as the seventy-five year-old former Nazi, so much so that it was almost hard to imagine him as the same man who would later play as the vivacious villain Magneto of the X-men series, or the kindhearted and powerful wizard Gandalf of the Lord of the of the Rings. Brad Renfro gave a less thrilling performance as Todd Bowen, the highly intelligent protagonist with a shade for the sadistic. Renfro was too many sullen stares, bored smirks and petulant exclamations, and too little harsh resolve, but at moments he did shine. And perhaps his moody performance was somewhat appropriate to the character, a teenage boy entangled in something from which he could not escape. I cannot accurately draw a comparison between the book and the movie, having only seen the movie, but I can say that from what I've heard and read, the book and movie should be judged on their own merits. The movie isn't so much as an adaptation as much as almost a reinterpretation or retelling of the original story, and has a drastically different ending from the book. All in all I can say that I enjoyed the film- it didn't absolutely blow me away or have me eager to watch it a second time- but it was worth the paltry sum that I paid for it and maybe more.

    Apt Pupil is a simple story about a disturbed teenage boy living in urban Los Angeles. When he discovers that a neighbor of his is a war criminal who used to run a Nazi concentration camp, he can't resist blackmailing the poor old man. However as the film develops the old man begins to turn the tables on the boy and starts blackmailing him instead. A sort of psychological game develops between the two and along with it, an odd, scary friendship. Apt Pupil was originally written by Stephen King but in my opinion, the film is superior to the novel, which I feel is excessively violent and gratuitous in how it described rape, torture, murder and killing sprees. The novel may have done a better job of describing a psychotic mind, but Apt Pupil goes to the trouble of developing said mind and showing how a child loses his innocence and deteriorates into this sociopathic shell. I also like how the film portrayed Dussander as a sympathetic character at first, although I felt the book did that aspect better. Dussander is ashamed of himself for what he has done but as the film goes on, his mind, too, starts to lose itself and he starts to embrace nazism. This film itself is just plain scary in its depiction of human nature and what we're all capable of. Apt Pupil won't be liked by many because it requires an attention span, a tolerance of disturbing and dark material, and an imagination to appreciate. People who dislike this film are missing the point. It's a wonderful story of a partnership between two individuals who each have their demons that they must face, along with some deadly secrets that could cripple their existence. This film is spellbinding and dazzling. If you can take what it dishes out, you will love it. If you have a faint heart, go watch something else. But if you want to learn how two men blackmail each other and how ultimately their plan fails, watch this movie for the psychology of it. The direction by Bryan Singer is superb and the camera-work creates some of the most powerful and tragic scenes in recent memory. The part where the man in the hospital recognizes Dussander is gut-wrenching alone. This is an amazing film. If you want to look into the darkness inside yourself, watch this movie, and then contemplate it. You'd be surprised what you are capable of.

    There have been many films and books that attempt to explain the horror that we humans are capable of. While I haven't read the Stephen King nouvelle "Apt Pupil", I can tell you this film adaptation kept my attention and threw out some new ideas I hadn't really considered. If you haven't already seen it, search for the Stanley Milgram experiment. It was a psychological test done by a Yale student back in the 1960s offering one of the most chilling explanations for the phenomenon of Nazism, a convincing illustration of how humans can do horrific things. The gist is that we convince ourselves that we're doing what we're supposed to be doing ("just following orders" or "everyone told me to do it"). The video is online on dailymotion. "Apt Pupil" surprised me by taking a very different approach which I won't ruin for you. I'll just say that it weaves a complex Machiavellian scheme, where evil is deliberate and conscious of itself. It finds its footing by creating a balance of power, reminiscent of the "mutual assured destruction" philosophy in the 80s that led the USA and Russia to stockpile enough nukes to send us to the Smurf universe. OK, enough background. Let's talk about the film already. If the premise doesn't capture you instantly, the impressive directing and musical score should suck you in with its heavy, foreboding mood. Ian McKellan (probably best known as Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings but also an accomplished Shakespearean actor) is excellent in the role of an ex- Nazi... a menacing enigma somewhere between a serial killer and a cranky grandfather. Brad Renfro appears on screen as the perfect na&iuml;ve kid with a perpetual deer-in-the- headlights expression, sort of like John Cusack in the 80s but without the laughs. The film focuses mainly on the transformation of Renfro's character. It's here where I was unconvinced, and I docked the film a point or 2. Renfro's character mutates so suddenly and drastically you'd think he sucked down some radioactive sludge. I feel a lot of his "experiments with evil" were uncharacteristic and thrown in for shock value. No matter how curious a person is, nobody goes from Pollyanna to animal mutilations in just a month or two. It was this seemingly random, inexplicable moral decay which I felt was just injected for cheap shock value. If you can get past that, the real theme emerges. The root of human evil, according to "Apt Pupil," is not random moral decay but actually a complex struggle for power. When this theme emerged in the latter half, that's when I perked up and paid attention. The story then takes on a suspenseful air, and the kid & the Nazi get into an interesting game of cat & mouse. Overall, I'll stick with the Stanley Milgram experiment for the most convincing explanation of human atrocities. But "Apt Pupil" definitely delivers some food for thought. Another film that provides insight is the criminally underrated "Exorcist III" with George C. Scott and Brad Dourif playing mind games in an insane asylum. Also check out the documentary "Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer," or on the lighter side, "Dr. Strangelove" makes an interesting commentary on why humans commit genocide. Who knows why humans kill, maim and torture. But as long as we keep investigating there may be hope for us.

Apt Pupil is the weakest film from Singer's filmography I have seen but it still a well made and compelling film. What lets it down is the weak script that was provided and it was really just a small film for Singer to keep himself busy before he got the X-Men gig (which I am thankful for).

    They take so many of Steven Kings many best sellers and turn them into movies. For the most part they miss the mark by a longshot with only around three exceptions maybe 5 depending on who you ask these include The Shining, Stand by Me, and the Shawshank Redemtion. Most of his books tuned into movies are terrible and this is one of those. The acting is alright but its nothing like the book at all. The book was very disturbing while this is not in the least disturbing. The story line is not even kept the same. It was the biggest disappointment since "IT" you should only really watch this if you have not read the book but then again Id just say read the book. This movie is about a young boy who finds out one of the elderly men in his neighbourhood is actually a Nazi war criminal. He ends up blackmailing him into telling him the horrors of the Nazi death camps because the kid has a sick obsession with it. He thinks he has all the control over the old man but the old has his tricks. Like I said this movie is no where near as good as the book. If you want a really intense disturbing book read it stay away from the movie unless there is no chance you will ever read the book.

    In the late 1990's there was a small resurgence in interest in the work of Stephen King, who had been popularised in the 1970's and '80's as the prime horror author. What was slightly more interesting about this late reprisal, was that the stories were not directly linked to the horror genre, and led to one of the most loved films of the 1990's, The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Whilst this film did not do well in the cinemas, it made it's impact on video, and therefore the more dramatic, cerebral and often realistic King adaptation's were given the green light. Hot off the success of 1995's The Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer was brought in to direct this story of power over other humans, and the devastation this can cause. Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a top student in his high-school, and the film opens on a closing class focusing on the holocaust. The subject has clearly opened up something in the young man. Being convinced that there is an ex-Nazi officer living secretly in his neighbourhood, he decides to pay the man, Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellen), a visit. What transpires is that Todd had collected research on the subject, and uses this to blackmail Kurt into revisiting and verbalising his war stories, with particularly macabre focus on the killing of Jews. As the relationship between the two progresses it becomes clear that what fascinates Todd the most, is the power that was exerted over a people, and he has a hunger to know what this power is like. This begins with his power over Kurt; he revels in a display of power after he purchases a Nazi uniform for Kurt and makes him march on the spot. However the power that Todd exposes, is also resurfaced in the very isolated old man. Well, as this is a Stephen King adaptation, the film obviously leads to murder. But the main theme of the film is the abuses of power, and the corrupting nature of power over others. It's a very interesting film, and Singer's direction is spot on. Seeing this now also highlights the loss of a very promising actor, Brad Renfro, who unfortunately died of a drug overdose in 2008. However, without any doubt this is McKellen's film. He is note perfect for this ageing, lonely man, who has had to live with his knowledge of the concentration camps for many years. The film does tend to lose it's effect at times, and falls into a clich&eacute;d trap; for example, after Kurt has attempted to kill a homeless guy, but has to get the young Todd to finish the job after suffering a heart attack, Todd repeatedly hits the tramp with a shovel - a jump moment proceeds as the tramp gets back up after 'being killed' - yawn. However, this seems mainly to be the fault of the narrative, and is easy to overcome, particularly with the two fine central performances. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Sadly whatever made the novel good is lacking in this adaptation. Apt Pupil is a movie that feels like a new director took over every five minutes with a different idea of where the movie should go. It creates a vortex that sucks up any chance at emotional connection to the characters or overall film. What little plot there is gets rushed. There are several times when the film is too lazy or simply incapable of properly showing passages of time so it simply cuts to black 'X weeks/months later..' screens. Poor editing destroys any chance to introspect on the conversations between Kurt and Todd. One moment Kurt will be describing Holocaust victims defecating on themselves in the gas chamber and then abruptly a basketball is on screen and Todd is at school in gym class. Then a moment later his friend is talking about dates and parties in the locker-room. The on screen chemistry between Kurt and Todd is that of a wet paper-towel. The characterizations feel wrong and not in an interesting way. Think of an adult being scared of a baby. That's basically what you get. Kurt, a former SS officer who worked in both Bergen-Belsen and the notorious Auschwitz camp shrinks constantly away at Todd who is nothing but an angsty spoiled emo teenager. The movie would've been far better served with a more aggressive stance from Kurt, especially when the movie is attempting to show how evil and 'badass' the Nazis were. Even without any sort of chemistry and with Kurt being blackmailed and forced to dress up for Todd, he abruptly takes a shine to him ala Miyagi style and impersonates being his Grandfather to the guidance counsellor and the movie shifts into Todd's school life and trying to get his grades up. Then it shifts back to them hating each other. Then abruptly Kurt, who is a wanted fugitive who has intelligently and carefully concealed his identity for decades and lived a law-abiding life in the US decides to stab someone. None of it makes much sense and we care even less to figure out why because he doesn't like Todd and Todd seems to be a blossoming sociopath who doesn't like anyone except himself. Ultimately I feel like what I watched was a boy's masturbatory fantasy about having his own private SS officer to dress up, interrogate and harass mixed in with odd and boring clips of teenage high school angst. Not good for a movie that bills itself to be basically a Nazi thriller.

    'The Usual Suspects' is one of my favorite films, and 'Apt Pupil' is the closest that Bryan Singer has ever come to recreating the atmosphere and intensity of his prior work. 'Pupil' is a very flawed film, but still an entertaining and insightful one. I haven't read the Stephen King novella which it is based upon for quite some time, so I don't recall all of the differences between the two works. Todd Bowden is a seemingly above average high school student. In 1984, he is a sixteen year old high school senior who is also a star pitcher for his school's baseball team. Basically he is the kind of kid that every parent wishes they had, except that he has a hidden dark side. This dark side manifests itself in a morbid fascination with the horrific crimes against humanity that were committed by the third Reich. An uncredited Christopher McQuarrie opens the film with a fantastically written narration, asking whether the Nazis actions were the result of economic, cultural, or social influences. He then posits that it may simply have been human nature. On the bus home one night, Todd recognizes an old man named Kurt Dussander as one of the famous war criminals he has been obsessively studying. The look of recognition in actor Brad Renfro's eye as the camera pans in is subtly and fantastically depicted. Bowden goes to great lengths to ensure that he has the right man before he confronts him (to include analyzing fingerprints). Todd has no interest in turning the Dussander in; instead he blackmails him into giving detailed recollections of his grisly past. The movie slowly becomes a chess game between the two, and soon they are blackmailing each other. As Dussander warns, Todd is playing with fire. John Ottman's opening score was disappointing, but the rest of the music and his editing were top notch. The film's primary flaw is that ten minutes or so could have been edited out of the middle portion of the film. Elias Koteas is a great actor, but his scenes go on for far too long, to the point of undermining the suspense. Tighter editing could have made this a much more popular film in my opinion, because the performances are stunning. Most of the film consists of Ian McKellan and Brad Renfro's characters in Dussander's house, and to their credit they're always compelling. Two scenes stand out for me. One is the dinner table scene, where Dussander easily wins over Todd's entire family with effortless charm. The second is where Todd forces him to wear an SS officer's uniform procured from a costumer (Dussander wryly notes that he's been promoted when he sees the rank tabs). His gradual descent back into his former self is chilling and McKellan plays it perfectly. Brandon Boyce's script and Bryan Singer's direction are dead on, except as I already mentioned more editing was needed in the middle of the film. The last half hour was masterfully constructed, and although the ending departs from the novella I preferred it. I think it had a lot more substance and was more unnerving than King's sudden, shocker ending. Does the film rely on a two amazing coincidences (Todd recognizing Dussander, and the old man sharing a hospital room with Dussander)? You bet. Does it work? I think so. Overall it's a good film with some interesting suppositions about the nature of evil, and it's a shame that it faded into obscurity.

    The movie Apt Pupil begins with a slow, but definitely solid start. Our protagonist, Todd Bowen, is an honor student at his high school. His history teacher is teaching "holocaust week" and Todd becomes intrigued and heads off to the library after class for more information. On his bus ride home, he spots a man who looks familiar- a little too familiar. Todd recognizes him to be Kurt Dussander, a Nazi who is being hunted for various crimes he committed during the second world war. After collecting a lot of evidence proving that the man he spotted was indeed Kurt Dussander, Todd decides to confront him. He gives Dussander (who is living under the alias Arthur Denker) an ultimatum; tell me all about your involvement in the holocaust, or I turn you and all the evidence over to the police. Dussander agrees to share his stories with Todd, and thus was the beginning of a confederacy that was to lead both parties involved down a path of darkness. Ian McKellan gives an amazing performance as the sarcastic and witty Kurt Dussander. In my opinion, McKellan definitely carried the movie. He was totally convincing as the seventy-five year-old former Nazi, so much so that it was almost hard to imagine him as the same man who would later play as the vivacious villain Magneto of the X-men series, or the kindhearted and powerful wizard Gandalf of the Lord of the of the Rings. Brad Renfro gave a less thrilling performance as Todd Bowen, the highly intelligent protagonist with a shade for the sadistic. Renfro was too many sullen stares, bored smirks and petulant exclamations, and too little harsh resolve, but at moments he did shine. And perhaps his moody performance was somewhat appropriate to the character, a teenage boy entangled in something from which he could not escape. I cannot accurately draw a comparison between the book and the movie, having only seen the movie, but I can say that from what I've heard and read, the book and movie should be judged on their own merits. The movie isn't so much as an adaptation as much as almost a reinterpretation or retelling of the original story, and has a drastically different ending from the book. All in all I can say that I enjoyed the film- it didn't absolutely blow me away or have me eager to watch it a second time- but it was worth the paltry sum that I paid for it and maybe more.

    Apt Pupil is a simple story about a disturbed teenage boy living in urban Los Angeles. When he discovers that a neighbor of his is a war criminal who used to run a Nazi concentration camp, he can't resist blackmailing the poor old man. However as the film develops the old man begins to turn the tables on the boy and starts blackmailing him instead. A sort of psychological game develops between the two and along with it, an odd, scary friendship. Apt Pupil was originally written by Stephen King but in my opinion, the film is superior to the novel, which I feel is excessively violent and gratuitous in how it described rape, torture, murder and killing sprees. The novel may have done a better job of describing a psychotic mind, but Apt Pupil goes to the trouble of developing said mind and showing how a child loses his innocence and deteriorates into this sociopathic shell. I also like how the film portrayed Dussander as a sympathetic character at first, although I felt the book did that aspect better. Dussander is ashamed of himself for what he has done but as the film goes on, his mind, too, starts to lose itself and he starts to embrace nazism. This film itself is just plain scary in its depiction of human nature and what we're all capable of. Apt Pupil won't be liked by many because it requires an attention span, a tolerance of disturbing and dark material, and an imagination to appreciate. People who dislike this film are missing the point. It's a wonderful story of a partnership between two individuals who each have their demons that they must face, along with some deadly secrets that could cripple their existence. This film is spellbinding and dazzling. If you can take what it dishes out, you will love it. If you have a faint heart, go watch something else. But if you want to learn how two men blackmail each other and how ultimately their plan fails, watch this movie for the psychology of it. The direction by Bryan Singer is superb and the camera-work creates some of the most powerful and tragic scenes in recent memory. The part where the man in the hospital recognizes Dussander is gut-wrenching alone. This is an amazing film. If you want to look into the darkness inside yourself, watch this movie, and then contemplate it. You'd be surprised what you are capable of.

    There have been many films and books that attempt to explain the horror that we humans are capable of. While I haven't read the Stephen King nouvelle "Apt Pupil", I can tell you this film adaptation kept my attention and threw out some new ideas I hadn't really considered. If you haven't already seen it, search for the Stanley Milgram experiment. It was a psychological test done by a Yale student back in the 1960s offering one of the most chilling explanations for the phenomenon of Nazism, a convincing illustration of how humans can do horrific things. The gist is that we convince ourselves that we're doing what we're supposed to be doing ("just following orders" or "everyone told me to do it"). The video is online on dailymotion. "Apt Pupil" surprised me by taking a very different approach which I won't ruin for you. I'll just say that it weaves a complex Machiavellian scheme, where evil is deliberate and conscious of itself. It finds its footing by creating a balance of power, reminiscent of the "mutual assured destruction" philosophy in the 80s that led the USA and Russia to stockpile enough nukes to send us to the Smurf universe. OK, enough background. Let's talk about the film already. If the premise doesn't capture you instantly, the impressive directing and musical score should suck you in with its heavy, foreboding mood. Ian McKellan (probably best known as Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings but also an accomplished Shakespearean actor) is excellent in the role of an ex- Nazi... a menacing enigma somewhere between a serial killer and a cranky grandfather. Brad Renfro appears on screen as the perfect na&iuml;ve kid with a perpetual deer-in-the- headlights expression, sort of like John Cusack in the 80s but without the laughs. The film focuses mainly on the transformation of Renfro's character. It's here where I was unconvinced, and I docked the film a point or 2. Renfro's character mutates so suddenly and drastically you'd think he sucked down some radioactive sludge. I feel a lot of his "experiments with evil" were uncharacteristic and thrown in for shock value. No matter how curious a person is, nobody goes from Pollyanna to animal mutilations in just a month or two. It was this seemingly random, inexplicable moral decay which I felt was just injected for cheap shock value. If you can get past that, the real theme emerges. The root of human evil, according to "Apt Pupil," is not random moral decay but actually a complex struggle for power. When this theme emerged in the latter half, that's when I perked up and paid attention. The story then takes on a suspenseful air, and the kid & the Nazi get into an interesting game of cat & mouse. Overall, I'll stick with the Stanley Milgram experiment for the most convincing explanation of human atrocities. But "Apt Pupil" definitely delivers some food for thought. Another film that provides insight is the criminally underrated "Exorcist III" with George C. Scott and Brad Dourif playing mind games in an insane asylum. Also check out the documentary "Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer," or on the lighter side, "Dr. Strangelove" makes an interesting commentary on why humans commit genocide. Who knows why humans kill, maim and torture. But as long as we keep investigating there may be hope for us.

    a Stephen King adaptation. good basis and seductive invitation for public. and the film is really correct work. tension, performance, levels of darkness. only problem - its message is too obvious. the story desires tell everything. and that everything is great cage for actors and viewer. because the powerful colors has not nuances. and the fight with shadows is a little delicate. but, it is a good film. that fact is not a surprise - Ian McKellen is great at all and Brad Renfro makes the best for his character - but it is something strange and confuse, unrealistic and forced. but the error must be novel author sin. short - a movie about evil. like a mirror almost clear.

    "Apt Pupil" refers to a teen (Todd) played by Brad Renfro, who discovers that a neighbor (Kurt Dussander) was a Nazi at several death camps. Todd becomes the apt pupil of Dussander. In one parallel, Dussander attempts to kill a cat, while Todd kills a pigeon. At the end, Todd threatens a guidance counselor who may expose his misbehavior, using the same threats that Dussander eventually used on him. And in the most direct parallel, Dussander thinks he has killed a man who knows about him, but Todd finishes off the man brutally. Subsequently, Dussander reflects back on the boy the same question asked of him as to how this felt. Todd's evil side blossoms as he exercises his domination over Dussander. Todd is the apt pupil, but he comes to it primed already. Dussander is like a reflecting mirror, and the more that Todd looks into this mirror, the more he becomes the Nazi character that he is seeing there. The story is unusual. Todd is a bright teen who discovers that Dussander was at the camps killing Jews. Instead of turning him in, he blackmails him. He threatens him with revealing his identity if he will only tell him stories of the death and how he felt about what he did. This is not through any kind of conscience or attempt at punishing the old man, played by Ian McKellen. Rather, the boy is fascinated by the evil and seems to want to participate and find out how it feels. As the story proceeds, Todd more and more gets drawn into evil behavior. The old man, humiliated and made to wear an old Nazi uniform, manages to turn the tables on the boy who then, toward the end of the story, scrambles to extricate himself. He succeeds, but not before having damaged his own character, or brought out its evil side so thoroughly, that there will be no going back.

    Between the making of The Usual Suspects and X-Men Bryan Singer made a small psychological thriller based on the Stephen King novella Apt Pupil. This was a story with a interesting premise but an uneven execution. In California town in 1984 Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a straight A-Level student and at the age of 16 he is already a High School student. When studying the Holocaust he discovers one of his neighbours, Arthur Denker (Ian McKellen) is actually a SS death camp commander and a wanted war criminal. Instead of telling the police Todd blackmails Denker to tell him stories about the Holocaust. Both character slowly end up playing mind games and powerplays with each other and awakening their darks demons within them. The basic idea had a lot of a potential and there were many different directions it could have gone. It could have been the boy finds out about the war criminal and the turns into an examination of the nature of guilt and evil, explore who is really the evil one in the relationship, a look a modern Nazism. The other way it could have gone is the boy could found the secret and does not know where to turn or finds its out the secret after befriending the man. The direction Apt Pupil starred off well enough as it better of wits between Todd and Denker but it slowly turns into more of a horror movie as both characters start to display the behaviour of emerging serial killers. It felt like this was a film wanting to be a thriller and horror more the being a more in depth study which it should have been and what Singer is more than capable of. It was the screenplay that lets the film down with forced moments (i.e. how Denker was discovered by the authorities) to some unrealistic character development. Renfro was a very stiff actor in the lead role and was a truly unlikeable character to lead the film. There was no real charm to him nor the charisma that a character like that needed to make you to make you care about what happened to him. But we were luckily were compensated with an excellent and dark performance from McKellen, playing a character who wants a quiet life and forced to relive his memories and by doing this his old dark and sadistic side. Singer is of course a talented director and he does bring some moments of visual flair involving dreams. There are some creepy looking scenes and the one where Todd was in the shower, the camera pans and changes filter was very well. The pacing is right throughout, Singer and his editor new when to speed up or slow down when needed and the scenes between Todd and Denker were filled with tension. A knife could have cut it as the two men tried to best the other one. There are themes about obsession, violence and the dark nature of humanity. A particular idea that was well done was how people can dream and be interest of violence and the darker elements of life but very different when actually confronted with it. Apt Pupil is the weakest film from Singer's filmography I have seen but it still a well made and compelling film. What lets it down is the weak script that was provided and it was really just a small film for Singer to keep himself busy before he got the X-Men gig (which I am thankful for).

Then it shifts back to them hating each other. Then abruptly Kurt, who is a wanted fugitive who has intelligently and carefully concealed his identity for decades and lived a law-abiding life in the US decides to stab someone. None of it makes much sense and we care even less to figure out why because he doesn't like Todd and Todd seems to be a blossoming sociopath who doesn't like anyone except himself. Ultimately I feel like what I watched was a boy's masturbatory fantasy about having his own private SS officer to dress up, interrogate and harass mixed in with odd and boring clips of teenage high school angst. Not good for a movie that bills itself to be basically a Nazi thriller.

    'The Usual Suspects' is one of my favorite films, and 'Apt Pupil' is the closest that Bryan Singer has ever come to recreating the atmosphere and intensity of his prior work. 'Pupil' is a very flawed film, but still an entertaining and insightful one. I haven't read the Stephen King novella which it is based upon for quite some time, so I don't recall all of the differences between the two works. Todd Bowden is a seemingly above average high school student. In 1984, he is a sixteen year old high school senior who is also a star pitcher for his school's baseball team. Basically he is the kind of kid that every parent wishes they had, except that he has a hidden dark side. This dark side manifests itself in a morbid fascination with the horrific crimes against humanity that were committed by the third Reich. An uncredited Christopher McQuarrie opens the film with a fantastically written narration, asking whether the Nazis actions were the result of economic, cultural, or social influences. He then posits that it may simply have been human nature. On the bus home one night, Todd recognizes an old man named Kurt Dussander as one of the famous war criminals he has been obsessively studying. The look of recognition in actor Brad Renfro's eye as the camera pans in is subtly and fantastically depicted. Bowden goes to great lengths to ensure that he has the right man before he confronts him (to include analyzing fingerprints). Todd has no interest in turning the Dussander in; instead he blackmails him into giving detailed recollections of his grisly past. The movie slowly becomes a chess game between the two, and soon they are blackmailing each other. As Dussander warns, Todd is playing with fire. John Ottman's opening score was disappointing, but the rest of the music and his editing were top notch. The film's primary flaw is that ten minutes or so could have been edited out of the middle portion of the film. Elias Koteas is a great actor, but his scenes go on for far too long, to the point of undermining the suspense. Tighter editing could have made this a much more popular film in my opinion, because the performances are stunning. Most of the film consists of Ian McKellan and Brad Renfro's characters in Dussander's house, and to their credit they're always compelling. Two scenes stand out for me. One is the dinner table scene, where Dussander easily wins over Todd's entire family with effortless charm. The second is where Todd forces him to wear an SS officer's uniform procured from a costumer (Dussander wryly notes that he's been promoted when he sees the rank tabs). His gradual descent back into his former self is chilling and McKellan plays it perfectly. Brandon Boyce's script and Bryan Singer's direction are dead on, except as I already mentioned more editing was needed in the middle of the film. The last half hour was masterfully constructed, and although the ending departs from the novella I preferred it. I think it had a lot more substance and was more unnerving than King's sudden, shocker ending. Does the film rely on a two amazing coincidences (Todd recognizing Dussander, and the old man sharing a hospital room with Dussander)? You bet. Does it work? I think so. Overall it's a good film with some interesting suppositions about the nature of evil, and it's a shame that it faded into obscurity.

    The movie Apt Pupil begins with a slow, but definitely solid start. Our protagonist, Todd Bowen, is an honor student at his high school. His history teacher is teaching "holocaust week" and Todd becomes intrigued and heads off to the library after class for more information. On his bus ride home, he spots a man who looks familiar- a little too familiar. Todd recognizes him to be Kurt Dussander, a Nazi who is being hunted for various crimes he committed during the second world war. After collecting a lot of evidence proving that the man he spotted was indeed Kurt Dussander, Todd decides to confront him. He gives Dussander (who is living under the alias Arthur Denker) an ultimatum; tell me all about your involvement in the holocaust, or I turn you and all the evidence over to the police. Dussander agrees to share his stories with Todd, and thus was the beginning of a confederacy that was to lead both parties involved down a path of darkness. Ian McKellan gives an amazing performance as the sarcastic and witty Kurt Dussander. In my opinion, McKellan definitely carried the movie. He was totally convincing as the seventy-five year-old former Nazi, so much so that it was almost hard to imagine him as the same man who would later play as the vivacious villain Magneto of the X-men series, or the kindhearted and powerful wizard Gandalf of the Lord of the of the Rings. Brad Renfro gave a less thrilling performance as Todd Bowen, the highly intelligent protagonist with a shade for the sadistic. Renfro was too many sullen stares, bored smirks and petulant exclamations, and too little harsh resolve, but at moments he did shine. And perhaps his moody performance was somewhat appropriate to the character, a teenage boy entangled in something from which he could not escape. I cannot accurately draw a comparison between the book and the movie, having only seen the movie, but I can say that from what I've heard and read, the book and movie should be judged on their own merits. The movie isn't so much as an adaptation as much as almost a reinterpretation or retelling of the original story, and has a drastically different ending from the book. All in all I can say that I enjoyed the film- it didn't absolutely blow me away or have me eager to watch it a second time- but it was worth the paltry sum that I paid for it and maybe more.

    Apt Pupil is a simple story about a disturbed teenage boy living in urban Los Angeles. When he discovers that a neighbor of his is a war criminal who used to run a Nazi concentration camp, he can't resist blackmailing the poor old man. However as the film develops the old man begins to turn the tables on the boy and starts blackmailing him instead. A sort of psychological game develops between the two and along with it, an odd, scary friendship. Apt Pupil was originally written by Stephen King but in my opinion, the film is superior to the novel, which I feel is excessively violent and gratuitous in how it described rape, torture, murder and killing sprees. The novel may have done a better job of describing a psychotic mind, but Apt Pupil goes to the trouble of developing said mind and showing how a child loses his innocence and deteriorates into this sociopathic shell. I also like how the film portrayed Dussander as a sympathetic character at first, although I felt the book did that aspect better. Dussander is ashamed of himself for what he has done but as the film goes on, his mind, too, starts to lose itself and he starts to embrace nazism. This film itself is just plain scary in its depiction of human nature and what we're all capable of. Apt Pupil won't be liked by many because it requires an attention span, a tolerance of disturbing and dark material, and an imagination to appreciate. People who dislike this film are missing the point. It's a wonderful story of a partnership between two individuals who each have their demons that they must face, along with some deadly secrets that could cripple their existence. This film is spellbinding and dazzling. If you can take what it dishes out, you will love it. If you have a faint heart, go watch something else. But if you want to learn how two men blackmail each other and how ultimately their plan fails, watch this movie for the psychology of it. The direction by Bryan Singer is superb and the camera-work creates some of the most powerful and tragic scenes in recent memory. The part where the man in the hospital recognizes Dussander is gut-wrenching alone. This is an amazing film. If you want to look into the darkness inside yourself, watch this movie, and then contemplate it. You'd be surprised what you are capable of.

    There have been many films and books that attempt to explain the horror that we humans are capable of. While I haven't read the Stephen King nouvelle "Apt Pupil", I can tell you this film adaptation kept my attention and threw out some new ideas I hadn't really considered. If you haven't already seen it, search for the Stanley Milgram experiment. It was a psychological test done by a Yale student back in the 1960s offering one of the most chilling explanations for the phenomenon of Nazism, a convincing illustration of how humans can do horrific things. The gist is that we convince ourselves that we're doing what we're supposed to be doing ("just following orders" or "everyone told me to do it"). The video is online on dailymotion. "Apt Pupil" surprised me by taking a very different approach which I won't ruin for you. I'll just say that it weaves a complex Machiavellian scheme, where evil is deliberate and conscious of itself. It finds its footing by creating a balance of power, reminiscent of the "mutual assured destruction" philosophy in the 80s that led the USA and Russia to stockpile enough nukes to send us to the Smurf universe. OK, enough background. Let's talk about the film already. If the premise doesn't capture you instantly, the impressive directing and musical score should suck you in with its heavy, foreboding mood. Ian McKellan (probably best known as Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings but also an accomplished Shakespearean actor) is excellent in the role of an ex- Nazi... a menacing enigma somewhere between a serial killer and a cranky grandfather. Brad Renfro appears on screen as the perfect na&iuml;ve kid with a perpetual deer-in-the- headlights expression, sort of like John Cusack in the 80s but without the laughs. The film focuses mainly on the transformation of Renfro's character. It's here where I was unconvinced, and I docked the film a point or 2. Renfro's character mutates so suddenly and drastically you'd think he sucked down some radioactive sludge. I feel a lot of his "experiments with evil" were uncharacteristic and thrown in for shock value. No matter how curious a person is, nobody goes from Pollyanna to animal mutilations in just a month or two. It was this seemingly random, inexplicable moral decay which I felt was just injected for cheap shock value. If you can get past that, the real theme emerges. The root of human evil, according to "Apt Pupil," is not random moral decay but actually a complex struggle for power. When this theme emerged in the latter half, that's when I perked up and paid attention. The story then takes on a suspenseful air, and the kid & the Nazi get into an interesting game of cat & mouse. Overall, I'll stick with the Stanley Milgram experiment for the most convincing explanation of human atrocities. But "Apt Pupil" definitely delivers some food for thought. Another film that provides insight is the criminally underrated "Exorcist III" with George C. Scott and Brad Dourif playing mind games in an insane asylum. Also check out the documentary "Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer," or on the lighter side, "Dr. Strangelove" makes an interesting commentary on why humans commit genocide. Who knows why humans kill, maim and torture. But as long as we keep investigating there may be hope for us.

    a Stephen King adaptation. good basis and seductive invitation for public. and the film is really correct work. tension, performance, levels of darkness. only problem - its message is too obvious. the story desires tell everything. and that everything is great cage for actors and viewer. because the powerful colors has not nuances. and the fight with shadows is a little delicate. but, it is a good film. that fact is not a surprise - Ian McKellen is great at all and Brad Renfro makes the best for his character - but it is something strange and confuse, unrealistic and forced. but the error must be novel author sin. short - a movie about evil. like a mirror almost clear.

    "Apt Pupil" refers to a teen (Todd) played by Brad Renfro, who discovers that a neighbor (Kurt Dussander) was a Nazi at several death camps. Todd becomes the apt pupil of Dussander. In one parallel, Dussander attempts to kill a cat, while Todd kills a pigeon. At the end, Todd threatens a guidance counselor who may expose his misbehavior, using the same threats that Dussander eventually used on him. And in the most direct parallel, Dussander thinks he has killed a man who knows about him, but Todd finishes off the man brutally. Subsequently, Dussander reflects back on the boy the same question asked of him as to how this felt. Todd's evil side blossoms as he exercises his domination over Dussander. Todd is the apt pupil, but he comes to it primed already. Dussander is like a reflecting mirror, and the more that Todd looks into this mirror, the more he becomes the Nazi character that he is seeing there. The story is unusual. Todd is a bright teen who discovers that Dussander was at the camps killing Jews. Instead of turning him in, he blackmails him. He threatens him with revealing his identity if he will only tell him stories of the death and how he felt about what he did. This is not through any kind of conscience or attempt at punishing the old man, played by Ian McKellen. Rather, the boy is fascinated by the evil and seems to want to participate and find out how it feels. As the story proceeds, Todd more and more gets drawn into evil behavior. The old man, humiliated and made to wear an old Nazi uniform, manages to turn the tables on the boy who then, toward the end of the story, scrambles to extricate himself. He succeeds, but not before having damaged his own character, or brought out its evil side so thoroughly, that there will be no going back.

    Between the making of The Usual Suspects and X-Men Bryan Singer made a small psychological thriller based on the Stephen King novella Apt Pupil. This was a story with a interesting premise but an uneven execution. In California town in 1984 Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a straight A-Level student and at the age of 16 he is already a High School student. When studying the Holocaust he discovers one of his neighbours, Arthur Denker (Ian McKellen) is actually a SS death camp commander and a wanted war criminal. Instead of telling the police Todd blackmails Denker to tell him stories about the Holocaust. Both character slowly end up playing mind games and powerplays with each other and awakening their darks demons within them. The basic idea had a lot of a potential and there were many different directions it could have gone. It could have been the boy finds out about the war criminal and the turns into an examination of the nature of guilt and evil, explore who is really the evil one in the relationship, a look a modern Nazism. The other way it could have gone is the boy could found the secret and does not know where to turn or finds its out the secret after befriending the man. The direction Apt Pupil starred off well enough as it better of wits between Todd and Denker but it slowly turns into more of a horror movie as both characters start to display the behaviour of emerging serial killers. It felt like this was a film wanting to be a thriller and horror more the being a more in depth study which it should have been and what Singer is more than capable of. It was the screenplay that lets the film down with forced moments (i.e. how Denker was discovered by the authorities) to some unrealistic character development. Renfro was a very stiff actor in the lead role and was a truly unlikeable character to lead the film. There was no real charm to him nor the charisma that a character like that needed to make you to make you care about what happened to him. But we were luckily were compensated with an excellent and dark performance from McKellen, playing a character who wants a quiet life and forced to relive his memories and by doing this his old dark and sadistic side. Singer is of course a talented director and he does bring some moments of visual flair involving dreams. There are some creepy looking scenes and the one where Todd was in the shower, the camera pans and changes filter was very well. The pacing is right throughout, Singer and his editor new when to speed up or slow down when needed and the scenes between Todd and Denker were filled with tension. A knife could have cut it as the two men tried to best the other one. There are themes about obsession, violence and the dark nature of humanity. A particular idea that was well done was how people can dream and be interest of violence and the darker elements of life but very different when actually confronted with it. Apt Pupil is the weakest film from Singer's filmography I have seen but it still a well made and compelling film. What lets it down is the weak script that was provided and it was really just a small film for Singer to keep himself busy before he got the X-Men gig (which I am thankful for).

    They take so many of Steven Kings many best sellers and turn them into movies. For the most part they miss the mark by a longshot with only around three exceptions maybe 5 depending on who you ask these include The Shining, Stand by Me, and the Shawshank Redemtion. Most of his books tuned into movies are terrible and this is one of those. The acting is alright but its nothing like the book at all. The book was very disturbing while this is not in the least disturbing. The story line is not even kept the same. It was the biggest disappointment since "IT" you should only really watch this if you have not read the book but then again Id just say read the book. This movie is about a young boy who finds out one of the elderly men in his neighbourhood is actually a Nazi war criminal. He ends up blackmailing him into telling him the horrors of the Nazi death camps because the kid has a sick obsession with it. He thinks he has all the control over the old man but the old has his tricks. Like I said this movie is no where near as good as the book. If you want a really intense disturbing book read it stay away from the movie unless there is no chance you will ever read the book.

    In the late 1990's there was a small resurgence in interest in the work of Stephen King, who had been popularised in the 1970's and '80's as the prime horror author. What was slightly more interesting about this late reprisal, was that the stories were not directly linked to the horror genre, and led to one of the most loved films of the 1990's, The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Whilst this film did not do well in the cinemas, it made it's impact on video, and therefore the more dramatic, cerebral and often realistic King adaptation's were given the green light. Hot off the success of 1995's The Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer was brought in to direct this story of power over other humans, and the devastation this can cause. Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a top student in his high-school, and the film opens on a closing class focusing on the holocaust. The subject has clearly opened up something in the young man. Being convinced that there is an ex-Nazi officer living secretly in his neighbourhood, he decides to pay the man, Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellen), a visit. What transpires is that Todd had collected research on the subject, and uses this to blackmail Kurt into revisiting and verbalising his war stories, with particularly macabre focus on the killing of Jews. As the relationship between the two progresses it becomes clear that what fascinates Todd the most, is the power that was exerted over a people, and he has a hunger to know what this power is like. This begins with his power over Kurt; he revels in a display of power after he purchases a Nazi uniform for Kurt and makes him march on the spot. However the power that Todd exposes, is also resurfaced in the very isolated old man. Well, as this is a Stephen King adaptation, the film obviously leads to murder. But the main theme of the film is the abuses of power, and the corrupting nature of power over others. It's a very interesting film, and Singer's direction is spot on. Seeing this now also highlights the loss of a very promising actor, Brad Renfro, who unfortunately died of a drug overdose in 2008. However, without any doubt this is McKellen's film. He is note perfect for this ageing, lonely man, who has had to live with his knowledge of the concentration camps for many years. The film does tend to lose it's effect at times, and falls into a clich&eacute;d trap; for example, after Kurt has attempted to kill a homeless guy, but has to get the young Todd to finish the job after suffering a heart attack, Todd repeatedly hits the tramp with a shovel - a jump moment proceeds as the tramp gets back up after 'being killed' - yawn. However, this seems mainly to be the fault of the narrative, and is easy to overcome, particularly with the two fine central performances. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Sadly whatever made the novel good is lacking in this adaptation. Apt Pupil is a movie that feels like a new director took over every five minutes with a different idea of where the movie should go. It creates a vortex that sucks up any chance at emotional connection to the characters or overall film. What little plot there is gets rushed. There are several times when the film is too lazy or simply incapable of properly showing passages of time so it simply cuts to black 'X weeks/months later..' screens. Poor editing destroys any chance to introspect on the conversations between Kurt and Todd. One moment Kurt will be describing Holocaust victims defecating on themselves in the gas chamber and then abruptly a basketball is on screen and Todd is at school in gym class. Then a moment later his friend is talking about dates and parties in the locker-room. The on screen chemistry between Kurt and Todd is that of a wet paper-towel. The characterizations feel wrong and not in an interesting way. Think of an adult being scared of a baby. That's basically what you get. Kurt, a former SS officer who worked in both Bergen-Belsen and the notorious Auschwitz camp shrinks constantly away at Todd who is nothing but an angsty spoiled emo teenager. The movie would've been far better served with a more aggressive stance from Kurt, especially when the movie is attempting to show how evil and 'badass' the Nazis were. Even without any sort of chemistry and with Kurt being blackmailed and forced to dress up for Todd, he abruptly takes a shine to him ala Miyagi style and impersonates being his Grandfather to the guidance counsellor and the movie shifts into Todd's school life and trying to get his grades up. Then it shifts back to them hating each other. Then abruptly Kurt, who is a wanted fugitive who has intelligently and carefully concealed his identity for decades and lived a law-abiding life in the US decides to stab someone. None of it makes much sense and we care even less to figure out why because he doesn't like Todd and Todd seems to be a blossoming sociopath who doesn't like anyone except himself. Ultimately I feel like what I watched was a boy's masturbatory fantasy about having his own private SS officer to dress up, interrogate and harass mixed in with odd and boring clips of teenage high school angst. Not good for a movie that bills itself to be basically a Nazi thriller.

Overall it's a good film with some interesting suppositions about the nature of evil, and it's a shame that it faded into obscurity.

Renfro was too many sullen stares, bored smirks and petulant exclamations, and too little harsh resolve, but at moments he did shine. And perhaps his moody performance was somewhat appropriate to the character, a teenage boy entangled in something from which he could not escape.

    Apt Pupil is a simple story about a disturbed teenage boy living in urban Los Angeles. When he discovers that a neighbor of his is a war criminal who used to run a Nazi concentration camp, he can't resist blackmailing the poor old man. However as the film develops the old man begins to turn the tables on the boy and starts blackmailing him instead. A sort of psychological game develops between the two and along with it, an odd, scary friendship. Apt Pupil was originally written by Stephen King but in my opinion, the film is superior to the novel, which I feel is excessively violent and gratuitous in how it described rape, torture, murder and killing sprees. The novel may have done a better job of describing a psychotic mind, but Apt Pupil goes to the trouble of developing said mind and showing how a child loses his innocence and deteriorates into this sociopathic shell. I also like how the film portrayed Dussander as a sympathetic character at first, although I felt the book did that aspect better. Dussander is ashamed of himself for what he has done but as the film goes on, his mind, too, starts to lose itself and he starts to embrace nazism. This film itself is just plain scary in its depiction of human nature and what we're all capable of. Apt Pupil won't be liked by many because it requires an attention span, a tolerance of disturbing and dark material, and an imagination to appreciate. People who dislike this film are missing the point. It's a wonderful story of a partnership between two individuals who each have their demons that they must face, along with some deadly secrets that could cripple their existence. This film is spellbinding and dazzling. If you can take what it dishes out, you will love it. If you have a faint heart, go watch something else. But if you want to learn how two men blackmail each other and how ultimately their plan fails, watch this movie for the psychology of it. The direction by Bryan Singer is superb and the camera-work creates some of the most powerful and tragic scenes in recent memory. The part where the man in the hospital recognizes Dussander is gut-wrenching alone. This is an amazing film. If you want to look into the darkness inside yourself, watch this movie, and then contemplate it. You'd be surprised what you are capable of.

    There have been many films and books that attempt to explain the horror that we humans are capable of. While I haven't read the Stephen King nouvelle "Apt Pupil", I can tell you this film adaptation kept my attention and threw out some new ideas I hadn't really considered. If you haven't already seen it, search for the Stanley Milgram experiment. It was a psychological test done by a Yale student back in the 1960s offering one of the most chilling explanations for the phenomenon of Nazism, a convincing illustration of how humans can do horrific things. The gist is that we convince ourselves that we're doing what we're supposed to be doing ("just following orders" or "everyone told me to do it"). The video is online on dailymotion. "Apt Pupil" surprised me by taking a very different approach which I won't ruin for you. I'll just say that it weaves a complex Machiavellian scheme, where evil is deliberate and conscious of itself. It finds its footing by creating a balance of power, reminiscent of the "mutual assured destruction" philosophy in the 80s that led the USA and Russia to stockpile enough nukes to send us to the Smurf universe. OK, enough background. Let's talk about the film already. If the premise doesn't capture you instantly, the impressive directing and musical score should suck you in with its heavy, foreboding mood. Ian McKellan (probably best known as Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings but also an accomplished Shakespearean actor) is excellent in the role of an ex- Nazi... a menacing enigma somewhere between a serial killer and a cranky grandfather. Brad Renfro appears on screen as the perfect na&iuml;ve kid with a perpetual deer-in-the- headlights expression, sort of like John Cusack in the 80s but without the laughs. The film focuses mainly on the transformation of Renfro's character. It's here where I was unconvinced, and I docked the film a point or 2. Renfro's character mutates so suddenly and drastically you'd think he sucked down some radioactive sludge. I feel a lot of his "experiments with evil" were uncharacteristic and thrown in for shock value. No matter how curious a person is, nobody goes from Pollyanna to animal mutilations in just a month or two. It was this seemingly random, inexplicable moral decay which I felt was just injected for cheap shock value. If you can get past that, the real theme emerges. The root of human evil, according to "Apt Pupil," is not random moral decay but actually a complex struggle for power. When this theme emerged in the latter half, that's when I perked up and paid attention. The story then takes on a suspenseful air, and the kid & the Nazi get into an interesting game of cat & mouse. Overall, I'll stick with the Stanley Milgram experiment for the most convincing explanation of human atrocities. But "Apt Pupil" definitely delivers some food for thought. Another film that provides insight is the criminally underrated "Exorcist III" with George C. Scott and Brad Dourif playing mind games in an insane asylum. Also check out the documentary "Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer," or on the lighter side, "Dr. Strangelove" makes an interesting commentary on why humans commit genocide. Who knows why humans kill, maim and torture. But as long as we keep investigating there may be hope for us.

    a Stephen King adaptation. good basis and seductive invitation for public. and the film is really correct work. tension, performance, levels of darkness. only problem - its message is too obvious. the story desires tell everything. and that everything is great cage for actors and viewer. because the powerful colors has not nuances. and the fight with shadows is a little delicate. but, it is a good film. that fact is not a surprise - Ian McKellen is great at all and Brad Renfro makes the best for his character - but it is something strange and confuse, unrealistic and forced. but the error must be novel author sin. short - a movie about evil. like a mirror almost clear.

    "Apt Pupil" refers to a teen (Todd) played by Brad Renfro, who discovers that a neighbor (Kurt Dussander) was a Nazi at several death camps. Todd becomes the apt pupil of Dussander. In one parallel, Dussander attempts to kill a cat, while Todd kills a pigeon. At the end, Todd threatens a guidance counselor who may expose his misbehavior, using the same threats that Dussander eventually used on him. And in the most direct parallel, Dussander thinks he has killed a man who knows about him, but Todd finishes off the man brutally. Subsequently, Dussander reflects back on the boy the same question asked of him as to how this felt. Todd's evil side blossoms as he exercises his domination over Dussander. Todd is the apt pupil, but he comes to it primed already. Dussander is like a reflecting mirror, and the more that Todd looks into this mirror, the more he becomes the Nazi character that he is seeing there. The story is unusual. Todd is a bright teen who discovers that Dussander was at the camps killing Jews. Instead of turning him in, he blackmails him. He threatens him with revealing his identity if he will only tell him stories of the death and how he felt about what he did. This is not through any kind of conscience or attempt at punishing the old man, played by Ian McKellen. Rather, the boy is fascinated by the evil and seems to want to participate and find out how it feels. As the story proceeds, Todd more and more gets drawn into evil behavior. The old man, humiliated and made to wear an old Nazi uniform, manages to turn the tables on the boy who then, toward the end of the story, scrambles to extricate himself. He succeeds, but not before having damaged his own character, or brought out its evil side so thoroughly, that there will be no going back.

    Between the making of The Usual Suspects and X-Men Bryan Singer made a small psychological thriller based on the Stephen King novella Apt Pupil. This was a story with a interesting premise but an uneven execution. In California town in 1984 Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a straight A-Level student and at the age of 16 he is already a High School student. When studying the Holocaust he discovers one of his neighbours, Arthur Denker (Ian McKellen) is actually a SS death camp commander and a wanted war criminal. Instead of telling the police Todd blackmails Denker to tell him stories about the Holocaust. Both character slowly end up playing mind games and powerplays with each other and awakening their darks demons within them. The basic idea had a lot of a potential and there were many different directions it could have gone. It could have been the boy finds out about the war criminal and the turns into an examination of the nature of guilt and evil, explore who is really the evil one in the relationship, a look a modern Nazism. The other way it could have gone is the boy could found the secret and does not know where to turn or finds its out the secret after befriending the man. The direction Apt Pupil starred off well enough as it better of wits between Todd and Denker but it slowly turns into more of a horror movie as both characters start to display the behaviour of emerging serial killers. It felt like this was a film wanting to be a thriller and horror more the being a more in depth study which it should have been and what Singer is more than capable of. It was the screenplay that lets the film down with forced moments (i.e. how Denker was discovered by the authorities) to some unrealistic character development. Renfro was a very stiff actor in the lead role and was a truly unlikeable character to lead the film. There was no real charm to him nor the charisma that a character like that needed to make you to make you care about what happened to him. But we were luckily were compensated with an excellent and dark performance from McKellen, playing a character who wants a quiet life and forced to relive his memories and by doing this his old dark and sadistic side. Singer is of course a talented director and he does bring some moments of visual flair involving dreams. There are some creepy looking scenes and the one where Todd was in the shower, the camera pans and changes filter was very well. The pacing is right throughout, Singer and his editor new when to speed up or slow down when needed and the scenes between Todd and Denker were filled with tension. A knife could have cut it as the two men tried to best the other one. There are themes about obsession, violence and the dark nature of humanity. A particular idea that was well done was how people can dream and be interest of violence and the darker elements of life but very different when actually confronted with it. Apt Pupil is the weakest film from Singer's filmography I have seen but it still a well made and compelling film. What lets it down is the weak script that was provided and it was really just a small film for Singer to keep himself busy before he got the X-Men gig (which I am thankful for).

    They take so many of Steven Kings many best sellers and turn them into movies. For the most part they miss the mark by a longshot with only around three exceptions maybe 5 depending on who you ask these include The Shining, Stand by Me, and the Shawshank Redemtion. Most of his books tuned into movies are terrible and this is one of those. The acting is alright but its nothing like the book at all. The book was very disturbing while this is not in the least disturbing. The story line is not even kept the same. It was the biggest disappointment since "IT" you should only really watch this if you have not read the book but then again Id just say read the book. This movie is about a young boy who finds out one of the elderly men in his neighbourhood is actually a Nazi war criminal. He ends up blackmailing him into telling him the horrors of the Nazi death camps because the kid has a sick obsession with it. He thinks he has all the control over the old man but the old has his tricks. Like I said this movie is no where near as good as the book. If you want a really intense disturbing book read it stay away from the movie unless there is no chance you will ever read the book.

    In the late 1990's there was a small resurgence in interest in the work of Stephen King, who had been popularised in the 1970's and '80's as the prime horror author. What was slightly more interesting about this late reprisal, was that the stories were not directly linked to the horror genre, and led to one of the most loved films of the 1990's, The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Whilst this film did not do well in the cinemas, it made it's impact on video, and therefore the more dramatic, cerebral and often realistic King adaptation's were given the green light. Hot off the success of 1995's The Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer was brought in to direct this story of power over other humans, and the devastation this can cause. Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a top student in his high-school, and the film opens on a closing class focusing on the holocaust. The subject has clearly opened up something in the young man. Being convinced that there is an ex-Nazi officer living secretly in his neighbourhood, he decides to pay the man, Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellen), a visit. What transpires is that Todd had collected research on the subject, and uses this to blackmail Kurt into revisiting and verbalising his war stories, with particularly macabre focus on the killing of Jews. As the relationship between the two progresses it becomes clear that what fascinates Todd the most, is the power that was exerted over a people, and he has a hunger to know what this power is like. This begins with his power over Kurt; he revels in a display of power after he purchases a Nazi uniform for Kurt and makes him march on the spot. However the power that Todd exposes, is also resurfaced in the very isolated old man. Well, as this is a Stephen King adaptation, the film obviously leads to murder. But the main theme of the film is the abuses of power, and the corrupting nature of power over others. It's a very interesting film, and Singer's direction is spot on. Seeing this now also highlights the loss of a very promising actor, Brad Renfro, who unfortunately died of a drug overdose in 2008. However, without any doubt this is McKellen's film. He is note perfect for this ageing, lonely man, who has had to live with his knowledge of the concentration camps for many years. The film does tend to lose it's effect at times, and falls into a clich&eacute;d trap; for example, after Kurt has attempted to kill a homeless guy, but has to get the young Todd to finish the job after suffering a heart attack, Todd repeatedly hits the tramp with a shovel - a jump moment proceeds as the tramp gets back up after 'being killed' - yawn. However, this seems mainly to be the fault of the narrative, and is easy to overcome, particularly with the two fine central performances. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Sadly whatever made the novel good is lacking in this adaptation. Apt Pupil is a movie that feels like a new director took over every five minutes with a different idea of where the movie should go. It creates a vortex that sucks up any chance at emotional connection to the characters or overall film. What little plot there is gets rushed. There are several times when the film is too lazy or simply incapable of properly showing passages of time so it simply cuts to black 'X weeks/months later..' screens. Poor editing destroys any chance to introspect on the conversations between Kurt and Todd. One moment Kurt will be describing Holocaust victims defecating on themselves in the gas chamber and then abruptly a basketball is on screen and Todd is at school in gym class. Then a moment later his friend is talking about dates and parties in the locker-room. The on screen chemistry between Kurt and Todd is that of a wet paper-towel. The characterizations feel wrong and not in an interesting way. Think of an adult being scared of a baby. That's basically what you get. Kurt, a former SS officer who worked in both Bergen-Belsen and the notorious Auschwitz camp shrinks constantly away at Todd who is nothing but an angsty spoiled emo teenager. The movie would've been far better served with a more aggressive stance from Kurt, especially when the movie is attempting to show how evil and 'badass' the Nazis were. Even without any sort of chemistry and with Kurt being blackmailed and forced to dress up for Todd, he abruptly takes a shine to him ala Miyagi style and impersonates being his Grandfather to the guidance counsellor and the movie shifts into Todd's school life and trying to get his grades up. Then it shifts back to them hating each other. Then abruptly Kurt, who is a wanted fugitive who has intelligently and carefully concealed his identity for decades and lived a law-abiding life in the US decides to stab someone. None of it makes much sense and we care even less to figure out why because he doesn't like Todd and Todd seems to be a blossoming sociopath who doesn't like anyone except himself. Ultimately I feel like what I watched was a boy's masturbatory fantasy about having his own private SS officer to dress up, interrogate and harass mixed in with odd and boring clips of teenage high school angst. Not good for a movie that bills itself to be basically a Nazi thriller.

    'The Usual Suspects' is one of my favorite films, and 'Apt Pupil' is the closest that Bryan Singer has ever come to recreating the atmosphere and intensity of his prior work. 'Pupil' is a very flawed film, but still an entertaining and insightful one. I haven't read the Stephen King novella which it is based upon for quite some time, so I don't recall all of the differences between the two works. Todd Bowden is a seemingly above average high school student. In 1984, he is a sixteen year old high school senior who is also a star pitcher for his school's baseball team. Basically he is the kind of kid that every parent wishes they had, except that he has a hidden dark side. This dark side manifests itself in a morbid fascination with the horrific crimes against humanity that were committed by the third Reich. An uncredited Christopher McQuarrie opens the film with a fantastically written narration, asking whether the Nazis actions were the result of economic, cultural, or social influences. He then posits that it may simply have been human nature. On the bus home one night, Todd recognizes an old man named Kurt Dussander as one of the famous war criminals he has been obsessively studying. The look of recognition in actor Brad Renfro's eye as the camera pans in is subtly and fantastically depicted. Bowden goes to great lengths to ensure that he has the right man before he confronts him (to include analyzing fingerprints). Todd has no interest in turning the Dussander in; instead he blackmails him into giving detailed recollections of his grisly past. The movie slowly becomes a chess game between the two, and soon they are blackmailing each other. As Dussander warns, Todd is playing with fire. John Ottman's opening score was disappointing, but the rest of the music and his editing were top notch. The film's primary flaw is that ten minutes or so could have been edited out of the middle portion of the film. Elias Koteas is a great actor, but his scenes go on for far too long, to the point of undermining the suspense. Tighter editing could have made this a much more popular film in my opinion, because the performances are stunning. Most of the film consists of Ian McKellan and Brad Renfro's characters in Dussander's house, and to their credit they're always compelling. Two scenes stand out for me. One is the dinner table scene, where Dussander easily wins over Todd's entire family with effortless charm. The second is where Todd forces him to wear an SS officer's uniform procured from a costumer (Dussander wryly notes that he's been promoted when he sees the rank tabs). His gradual descent back into his former self is chilling and McKellan plays it perfectly. Brandon Boyce's script and Bryan Singer's direction are dead on, except as I already mentioned more editing was needed in the middle of the film. The last half hour was masterfully constructed, and although the ending departs from the novella I preferred it. I think it had a lot more substance and was more unnerving than King's sudden, shocker ending. Does the film rely on a two amazing coincidences (Todd recognizing Dussander, and the old man sharing a hospital room with Dussander)? You bet. Does it work? I think so. Overall it's a good film with some interesting suppositions about the nature of evil, and it's a shame that it faded into obscurity.

    The movie Apt Pupil begins with a slow, but definitely solid start. Our protagonist, Todd Bowen, is an honor student at his high school. His history teacher is teaching "holocaust week" and Todd becomes intrigued and heads off to the library after class for more information. On his bus ride home, he spots a man who looks familiar- a little too familiar. Todd recognizes him to be Kurt Dussander, a Nazi who is being hunted for various crimes he committed during the second world war. After collecting a lot of evidence proving that the man he spotted was indeed Kurt Dussander, Todd decides to confront him. He gives Dussander (who is living under the alias Arthur Denker) an ultimatum; tell me all about your involvement in the holocaust, or I turn you and all the evidence over to the police. Dussander agrees to share his stories with Todd, and thus was the beginning of a confederacy that was to lead both parties involved down a path of darkness. Ian McKellan gives an amazing performance as the sarcastic and witty Kurt Dussander. In my opinion, McKellan definitely carried the movie. He was totally convincing as the seventy-five year-old former Nazi, so much so that it was almost hard to imagine him as the same man who would later play as the vivacious villain Magneto of the X-men series, or the kindhearted and powerful wizard Gandalf of the Lord of the of the Rings. Brad Renfro gave a less thrilling performance as Todd Bowen, the highly intelligent protagonist with a shade for the sadistic. Renfro was too many sullen stares, bored smirks and petulant exclamations, and too little harsh resolve, but at moments he did shine. And perhaps his moody performance was somewhat appropriate to the character, a teenage boy entangled in something from which he could not escape. I cannot accurately draw a comparison between the book and the movie, having only seen the movie, but I can say that from what I've heard and read, the book and movie should be judged on their own merits. The movie isn't so much as an adaptation as much as almost a reinterpretation or retelling of the original story, and has a drastically different ending from the book. All in all I can say that I enjoyed the film- it didn't absolutely blow me away or have me eager to watch it a second time- but it was worth the paltry sum that I paid for it and maybe more.

    "Apt Pupil" refers to a teen (Todd) played by Brad Renfro, who discovers that a neighbor (Kurt Dussander) was a Nazi at several death camps. Todd becomes the apt pupil of Dussander. In one parallel, Dussander attempts to kill a cat, while Todd kills a pigeon. At the end, Todd threatens a guidance counselor who may expose his misbehavior, using the same threats that Dussander eventually used on him. And in the most direct parallel, Dussander thinks he has killed a man who knows about him, but Todd finishes off the man brutally. Subsequently, Dussander reflects back on the boy the same question asked of him as to how this felt. Todd's evil side blossoms as he exercises his domination over Dussander. Todd is the apt pupil, but he comes to it primed already. Dussander is like a reflecting mirror, and the more that Todd looks into this mirror, the more he becomes the Nazi character that he is seeing there. The story is unusual. Todd is a bright teen who discovers that Dussander was at the camps killing Jews. Instead of turning him in, he blackmails him. He threatens him with revealing his identity if he will only tell him stories of the death and how he felt about what he did. This is not through any kind of conscience or attempt at punishing the old man, played by Ian McKellen. Rather, the boy is fascinated by the evil and seems to want to participate and find out how it feels. As the story proceeds, Todd more and more gets drawn into evil behavior. The old man, humiliated and made to wear an old Nazi uniform, manages to turn the tables on the boy who then, toward the end of the story, scrambles to extricate himself. He succeeds, but not before having damaged his own character, or brought out its evil side so thoroughly, that there will be no going back.

    Between the making of The Usual Suspects and X-Men Bryan Singer made a small psychological thriller based on the Stephen King novella Apt Pupil. This was a story with a interesting premise but an uneven execution. In California town in 1984 Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a straight A-Level student and at the age of 16 he is already a High School student. When studying the Holocaust he discovers one of his neighbours, Arthur Denker (Ian McKellen) is actually a SS death camp commander and a wanted war criminal. Instead of telling the police Todd blackmails Denker to tell him stories about the Holocaust. Both character slowly end up playing mind games and powerplays with each other and awakening their darks demons within them. The basic idea had a lot of a potential and there were many different directions it could have gone. It could have been the boy finds out about the war criminal and the turns into an examination of the nature of guilt and evil, explore who is really the evil one in the relationship, a look a modern Nazism. The other way it could have gone is the boy could found the secret and does not know where to turn or finds its out the secret after befriending the man. The direction Apt Pupil starred off well enough as it better of wits between Todd and Denker but it slowly turns into more of a horror movie as both characters start to display the behaviour of emerging serial killers. It felt like this was a film wanting to be a thriller and horror more the being a more in depth study which it should have been and what Singer is more than capable of. It was the screenplay that lets the film down with forced moments (i.e. how Denker was discovered by the authorities) to some unrealistic character development. Renfro was a very stiff actor in the lead role and was a truly unlikeable character to lead the film. There was no real charm to him nor the charisma that a character like that needed to make you to make you care about what happened to him. But we were luckily were compensated with an excellent and dark performance from McKellen, playing a character who wants a quiet life and forced to relive his memories and by doing this his old dark and sadistic side. Singer is of course a talented director and he does bring some moments of visual flair involving dreams. There are some creepy looking scenes and the one where Todd was in the shower, the camera pans and changes filter was very well. The pacing is right throughout, Singer and his editor new when to speed up or slow down when needed and the scenes between Todd and Denker were filled with tension. A knife could have cut it as the two men tried to best the other one. There are themes about obsession, violence and the dark nature of humanity. A particular idea that was well done was how people can dream and be interest of violence and the darker elements of life but very different when actually confronted with it. Apt Pupil is the weakest film from Singer's filmography I have seen but it still a well made and compelling film. What lets it down is the weak script that was provided and it was really just a small film for Singer to keep himself busy before he got the X-Men gig (which I am thankful for).

    They take so many of Steven Kings many best sellers and turn them into movies. For the most part they miss the mark by a longshot with only around three exceptions maybe 5 depending on who you ask these include The Shining, Stand by Me, and the Shawshank Redemtion. Most of his books tuned into movies are terrible and this is one of those. The acting is alright but its nothing like the book at all. The book was very disturbing while this is not in the least disturbing. The story line is not even kept the same. It was the biggest disappointment since "IT" you should only really watch this if you have not read the book but then again Id just say read the book. This movie is about a young boy who finds out one of the elderly men in his neighbourhood is actually a Nazi war criminal. He ends up blackmailing him into telling him the horrors of the Nazi death camps because the kid has a sick obsession with it. He thinks he has all the control over the old man but the old has his tricks. Like I said this movie is no where near as good as the book. If you want a really intense disturbing book read it stay away from the movie unless there is no chance you will ever read the book.

    In the late 1990's there was a small resurgence in interest in the work of Stephen King, who had been popularised in the 1970's and '80's as the prime horror author. What was slightly more interesting about this late reprisal, was that the stories were not directly linked to the horror genre, and led to one of the most loved films of the 1990's, The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Whilst this film did not do well in the cinemas, it made it's impact on video, and therefore the more dramatic, cerebral and often realistic King adaptation's were given the green light. Hot off the success of 1995's The Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer was brought in to direct this story of power over other humans, and the devastation this can cause. Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a top student in his high-school, and the film opens on a closing class focusing on the holocaust. The subject has clearly opened up something in the young man. Being convinced that there is an ex-Nazi officer living secretly in his neighbourhood, he decides to pay the man, Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellen), a visit. What transpires is that Todd had collected research on the subject, and uses this to blackmail Kurt into revisiting and verbalising his war stories, with particularly macabre focus on the killing of Jews. As the relationship between the two progresses it becomes clear that what fascinates Todd the most, is the power that was exerted over a people, and he has a hunger to know what this power is like. This begins with his power over Kurt; he revels in a display of power after he purchases a Nazi uniform for Kurt and makes him march on the spot. However the power that Todd exposes, is also resurfaced in the very isolated old man. Well, as this is a Stephen King adaptation, the film obviously leads to murder. But the main theme of the film is the abuses of power, and the corrupting nature of power over others. It's a very interesting film, and Singer's direction is spot on. Seeing this now also highlights the loss of a very promising actor, Brad Renfro, who unfortunately died of a drug overdose in 2008. However, without any doubt this is McKellen's film. He is note perfect for this ageing, lonely man, who has had to live with his knowledge of the concentration camps for many years. The film does tend to lose it's effect at times, and falls into a clich&eacute;d trap; for example, after Kurt has attempted to kill a homeless guy, but has to get the young Todd to finish the job after suffering a heart attack, Todd repeatedly hits the tramp with a shovel - a jump moment proceeds as the tramp gets back up after 'being killed' - yawn. However, this seems mainly to be the fault of the narrative, and is easy to overcome, particularly with the two fine central performances. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Sadly whatever made the novel good is lacking in this adaptation. Apt Pupil is a movie that feels like a new director took over every five minutes with a different idea of where the movie should go. It creates a vortex that sucks up any chance at emotional connection to the characters or overall film. What little plot there is gets rushed. There are several times when the film is too lazy or simply incapable of properly showing passages of time so it simply cuts to black 'X weeks/months later..' screens. Poor editing destroys any chance to introspect on the conversations between Kurt and Todd. One moment Kurt will be describing Holocaust victims defecating on themselves in the gas chamber and then abruptly a basketball is on screen and Todd is at school in gym class. Then a moment later his friend is talking about dates and parties in the locker-room. The on screen chemistry between Kurt and Todd is that of a wet paper-towel. The characterizations feel wrong and not in an interesting way. Think of an adult being scared of a baby. That's basically what you get. Kurt, a former SS officer who worked in both Bergen-Belsen and the notorious Auschwitz camp shrinks constantly away at Todd who is nothing but an angsty spoiled emo teenager. The movie would've been far better served with a more aggressive stance from Kurt, especially when the movie is attempting to show how evil and 'badass' the Nazis were. Even without any sort of chemistry and with Kurt being blackmailed and forced to dress up for Todd, he abruptly takes a shine to him ala Miyagi style and impersonates being his Grandfather to the guidance counsellor and the movie shifts into Todd's school life and trying to get his grades up. Then it shifts back to them hating each other. Then abruptly Kurt, who is a wanted fugitive who has intelligently and carefully concealed his identity for decades and lived a law-abiding life in the US decides to stab someone. None of it makes much sense and we care even less to figure out why because he doesn't like Todd and Todd seems to be a blossoming sociopath who doesn't like anyone except himself. Ultimately I feel like what I watched was a boy's masturbatory fantasy about having his own private SS officer to dress up, interrogate and harass mixed in with odd and boring clips of teenage high school angst. Not good for a movie that bills itself to be basically a Nazi thriller.

    'The Usual Suspects' is one of my favorite films, and 'Apt Pupil' is the closest that Bryan Singer has ever come to recreating the atmosphere and intensity of his prior work. 'Pupil' is a very flawed film, but still an entertaining and insightful one. I haven't read the Stephen King novella which it is based upon for quite some time, so I don't recall all of the differences between the two works. Todd Bowden is a seemingly above average high school student. In 1984, he is a sixteen year old high school senior who is also a star pitcher for his school's baseball team. Basically he is the kind of kid that every parent wishes they had, except that he has a hidden dark side. This dark side manifests itself in a morbid fascination with the horrific crimes against humanity that were committed by the third Reich. An uncredited Christopher McQuarrie opens the film with a fantastically written narration, asking whether the Nazis actions were the result of economic, cultural, or social influences. He then posits that it may simply have been human nature. On the bus home one night, Todd recognizes an old man named Kurt Dussander as one of the famous war criminals he has been obsessively studying. The look of recognition in actor Brad Renfro's eye as the camera pans in is subtly and fantastically depicted. Bowden goes to great lengths to ensure that he has the right man before he confronts him (to include analyzing fingerprints). Todd has no interest in turning the Dussander in; instead he blackmails him into giving detailed recollections of his grisly past. The movie slowly becomes a chess game between the two, and soon they are blackmailing each other. As Dussander warns, Todd is playing with fire. John Ottman's opening score was disappointing, but the rest of the music and his editing were top notch. The film's primary flaw is that ten minutes or so could have been edited out of the middle portion of the film. Elias Koteas is a great actor, but his scenes go on for far too long, to the point of undermining the suspense. Tighter editing could have made this a much more popular film in my opinion, because the performances are stunning. Most of the film consists of Ian McKellan and Brad Renfro's characters in Dussander's house, and to their credit they're always compelling. Two scenes stand out for me. One is the dinner table scene, where Dussander easily wins over Todd's entire family with effortless charm. The second is where Todd forces him to wear an SS officer's uniform procured from a costumer (Dussander wryly notes that he's been promoted when he sees the rank tabs). His gradual descent back into his former self is chilling and McKellan plays it perfectly. Brandon Boyce's script and Bryan Singer's direction are dead on, except as I already mentioned more editing was needed in the middle of the film. The last half hour was masterfully constructed, and although the ending departs from the novella I preferred it. I think it had a lot more substance and was more unnerving than King's sudden, shocker ending. Does the film rely on a two amazing coincidences (Todd recognizing Dussander, and the old man sharing a hospital room with Dussander)? You bet. Does it work? I think so. Overall it's a good film with some interesting suppositions about the nature of evil, and it's a shame that it faded into obscurity.

    The movie Apt Pupil begins with a slow, but definitely solid start. Our protagonist, Todd Bowen, is an honor student at his high school. His history teacher is teaching "holocaust week" and Todd becomes intrigued and heads off to the library after class for more information. On his bus ride home, he spots a man who looks familiar- a little too familiar. Todd recognizes him to be Kurt Dussander, a Nazi who is being hunted for various crimes he committed during the second world war. After collecting a lot of evidence proving that the man he spotted was indeed Kurt Dussander, Todd decides to confront him. He gives Dussander (who is living under the alias Arthur Denker) an ultimatum; tell me all about your involvement in the holocaust, or I turn you and all the evidence over to the police. Dussander agrees to share his stories with Todd, and thus was the beginning of a confederacy that was to lead both parties involved down a path of darkness. Ian McKellan gives an amazing performance as the sarcastic and witty Kurt Dussander. In my opinion, McKellan definitely carried the movie. He was totally convincing as the seventy-five year-old former Nazi, so much so that it was almost hard to imagine him as the same man who would later play as the vivacious villain Magneto of the X-men series, or the kindhearted and powerful wizard Gandalf of the Lord of the of the Rings. Brad Renfro gave a less thrilling performance as Todd Bowen, the highly intelligent protagonist with a shade for the sadistic. Renfro was too many sullen stares, bored smirks and petulant exclamations, and too little harsh resolve, but at moments he did shine. And perhaps his moody performance was somewhat appropriate to the character, a teenage boy entangled in something from which he could not escape. I cannot accurately draw a comparison between the book and the movie, having only seen the movie, but I can say that from what I've heard and read, the book and movie should be judged on their own merits. The movie isn't so much as an adaptation as much as almost a reinterpretation or retelling of the original story, and has a drastically different ending from the book. All in all I can say that I enjoyed the film- it didn't absolutely blow me away or have me eager to watch it a second time- but it was worth the paltry sum that I paid for it and maybe more.

    Apt Pupil is a simple story about a disturbed teenage boy living in urban Los Angeles. When he discovers that a neighbor of his is a war criminal who used to run a Nazi concentration camp, he can't resist blackmailing the poor old man. However as the film develops the old man begins to turn the tables on the boy and starts blackmailing him instead. A sort of psychological game develops between the two and along with it, an odd, scary friendship. Apt Pupil was originally written by Stephen King but in my opinion, the film is superior to the novel, which I feel is excessively violent and gratuitous in how it described rape, torture, murder and killing sprees. The novel may have done a better job of describing a psychotic mind, but Apt Pupil goes to the trouble of developing said mind and showing how a child loses his innocence and deteriorates into this sociopathic shell. I also like how the film portrayed Dussander as a sympathetic character at first, although I felt the book did that aspect better. Dussander is ashamed of himself for what he has done but as the film goes on, his mind, too, starts to lose itself and he starts to embrace nazism. This film itself is just plain scary in its depiction of human nature and what we're all capable of. Apt Pupil won't be liked by many because it requires an attention span, a tolerance of disturbing and dark material, and an imagination to appreciate. People who dislike this film are missing the point. It's a wonderful story of a partnership between two individuals who each have their demons that they must face, along with some deadly secrets that could cripple their existence. This film is spellbinding and dazzling. If you can take what it dishes out, you will love it. If you have a faint heart, go watch something else. But if you want to learn how two men blackmail each other and how ultimately their plan fails, watch this movie for the psychology of it. The direction by Bryan Singer is superb and the camera-work creates some of the most powerful and tragic scenes in recent memory. The part where the man in the hospital recognizes Dussander is gut-wrenching alone. This is an amazing film. If you want to look into the darkness inside yourself, watch this movie, and then contemplate it. You'd be surprised what you are capable of.

    There have been many films and books that attempt to explain the horror that we humans are capable of. While I haven't read the Stephen King nouvelle "Apt Pupil", I can tell you this film adaptation kept my attention and threw out some new ideas I hadn't really considered. If you haven't already seen it, search for the Stanley Milgram experiment. It was a psychological test done by a Yale student back in the 1960s offering one of the most chilling explanations for the phenomenon of Nazism, a convincing illustration of how humans can do horrific things. The gist is that we convince ourselves that we're doing what we're supposed to be doing ("just following orders" or "everyone told me to do it"). The video is online on dailymotion. "Apt Pupil" surprised me by taking a very different approach which I won't ruin for you. I'll just say that it weaves a complex Machiavellian scheme, where evil is deliberate and conscious of itself. It finds its footing by creating a balance of power, reminiscent of the "mutual assured destruction" philosophy in the 80s that led the USA and Russia to stockpile enough nukes to send us to the Smurf universe. OK, enough background. Let's talk about the film already. If the premise doesn't capture you instantly, the impressive directing and musical score should suck you in with its heavy, foreboding mood. Ian McKellan (probably best known as Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings but also an accomplished Shakespearean actor) is excellent in the role of an ex- Nazi... a menacing enigma somewhere between a serial killer and a cranky grandfather. Brad Renfro appears on screen as the perfect na&iuml;ve kid with a perpetual deer-in-the- headlights expression, sort of like John Cusack in the 80s but without the laughs. The film focuses mainly on the transformation of Renfro's character. It's here where I was unconvinced, and I docked the film a point or 2. Renfro's character mutates so suddenly and drastically you'd think he sucked down some radioactive sludge. I feel a lot of his "experiments with evil" were uncharacteristic and thrown in for shock value. No matter how curious a person is, nobody goes from Pollyanna to animal mutilations in just a month or two. It was this seemingly random, inexplicable moral decay which I felt was just injected for cheap shock value. If you can get past that, the real theme emerges. The root of human evil, according to "Apt Pupil," is not random moral decay but actually a complex struggle for power. When this theme emerged in the latter half, that's when I perked up and paid attention. The story then takes on a suspenseful air, and the kid & the Nazi get into an interesting game of cat & mouse. Overall, I'll stick with the Stanley Milgram experiment for the most convincing explanation of human atrocities. But "Apt Pupil" definitely delivers some food for thought. Another film that provides insight is the criminally underrated "Exorcist III" with George C. Scott and Brad Dourif playing mind games in an insane asylum. Also check out the documentary "Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer," or on the lighter side, "Dr. Strangelove" makes an interesting commentary on why humans commit genocide. Who knows why humans kill, maim and torture. But as long as we keep investigating there may be hope for us.

    a Stephen King adaptation. good basis and seductive invitation for public. and the film is really correct work. tension, performance, levels of darkness. only problem - its message is too obvious. the story desires tell everything. and that everything is great cage for actors and viewer. because the powerful colors has not nuances. and the fight with shadows is a little delicate. but, it is a good film. that fact is not a surprise - Ian McKellen is great at all and Brad Renfro makes the best for his character - but it is something strange and confuse, unrealistic and forced. but the error must be novel author sin. short - a movie about evil. like a mirror almost clear.

What was slightly more interesting about this late reprisal, was that the stories were not directly linked to the horror genre, and led to one of the most loved films of the 1990's, The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Whilst this film did not do well in the cinemas, it made it's impact on video, and therefore the more dramatic, cerebral and often realistic King adaptation's were given the green light. Hot off the success of 1995's The Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer was brought in to direct this story of power over other humans, and the devastation this can cause. Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a top student in his high-school, and the film opens on a closing class focusing on the holocaust. The subject has clearly opened up something in the young man. Being convinced that there is an ex-Nazi officer living secretly in his neighbourhood, he decides to pay the man, Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellen), a visit. What transpires is that Todd had collected research on the subject, and uses this to blackmail Kurt into revisiting and verbalising his war stories, with particularly macabre focus on the killing of Jews. As the relationship between the two progresses it becomes clear that what fascinates Todd the most, is the power that was exerted over a people, and he has a hunger to know what this power is like. This begins with his power over Kurt; he revels in a display of power after he purchases a Nazi uniform for Kurt and makes him march on the spot. However the power that Todd exposes, is also resurfaced in the very isolated old man. Well, as this is a Stephen King adaptation, the film obviously leads to murder. But the main theme of the film is the abuses of power, and the corrupting nature of power over others. It's a very interesting film, and Singer's direction is spot on. Seeing this now also highlights the loss of a very promising actor, Brad Renfro, who unfortunately died of a drug overdose in 2008. However, without any doubt this is McKellen's film. He is note perfect for this ageing, lonely man, who has had to live with his knowledge of the concentration camps for many years. The film does tend to lose it's effect at times, and falls into a clich&eacute;d trap; for example, after Kurt has attempted to kill a homeless guy, but has to get the young Todd to finish the job after suffering a heart attack, Todd repeatedly hits the tramp with a shovel - a jump moment proceeds as the tramp gets back up after 'being killed' - yawn. However, this seems mainly to be the fault of the narrative, and is easy to overcome, particularly with the two fine central performances. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Sadly whatever made the novel good is lacking in this adaptation. Apt Pupil is a movie that feels like a new director took over every five minutes with a different idea of where the movie should go. It creates a vortex that sucks up any chance at emotional connection to the characters or overall film. What little plot there is gets rushed. There are several times when the film is too lazy or simply incapable of properly showing passages of time so it simply cuts to black 'X weeks/months later..' screens. Poor editing destroys any chance to introspect on the conversations between Kurt and Todd. One moment Kurt will be describing Holocaust victims defecating on themselves in the gas chamber and then abruptly a basketball is on screen and Todd is at school in gym class. Then a moment later his friend is talking about dates and parties in the locker-room. The on screen chemistry between Kurt and Todd is that of a wet paper-towel. The characterizations feel wrong and not in an interesting way. Think of an adult being scared of a baby. That's basically what you get. Kurt, a former SS officer who worked in both Bergen-Belsen and the notorious Auschwitz camp shrinks constantly away at Todd who is nothing but an angsty spoiled emo teenager. The movie would've been far better served with a more aggressive stance from Kurt, especially when the movie is attempting to show how evil and 'badass' the Nazis were. Even without any sort of chemistry and with Kurt being blackmailed and forced to dress up for Todd, he abruptly takes a shine to him ala Miyagi style and impersonates being his Grandfather to the guidance counsellor and the movie shifts into Todd's school life and trying to get his grades up. Then it shifts back to them hating each other. Then abruptly Kurt, who is a wanted fugitive who has intelligently and carefully concealed his identity for decades and lived a law-abiding life in the US decides to stab someone. None of it makes much sense and we care even less to figure out why because he doesn't like Todd and Todd seems to be a blossoming sociopath who doesn't like anyone except himself. Ultimately I feel like what I watched was a boy's masturbatory fantasy about having his own private SS officer to dress up, interrogate and harass mixed in with odd and boring clips of teenage high school angst. Not good for a movie that bills itself to be basically a Nazi thriller.

    'The Usual Suspects' is one of my favorite films, and 'Apt Pupil' is the closest that Bryan Singer has ever come to recreating the atmosphere and intensity of his prior work. 'Pupil' is a very flawed film, but still an entertaining and insightful one. I haven't read the Stephen King novella which it is based upon for quite some time, so I don't recall all of the differences between the two works. Todd Bowden is a seemingly above average high school student. In 1984, he is a sixteen year old high school senior who is also a star pitcher for his school's baseball team. Basically he is the kind of kid that every parent wishes they had, except that he has a hidden dark side. This dark side manifests itself in a morbid fascination with the horrific crimes against humanity that were committed by the third Reich. An uncredited Christopher McQuarrie opens the film with a fantastically written narration, asking whether the Nazis actions were the result of economic, cultural, or social influences. He then posits that it may simply have been human nature. On the bus home one night, Todd recognizes an old man named Kurt Dussander as one of the famous war criminals he has been obsessively studying. The look of recognition in actor Brad Renfro's eye as the camera pans in is subtly and fantastically depicted. Bowden goes to great lengths to ensure that he has the right man before he confronts him (to include analyzing fingerprints). Todd has no interest in turning the Dussander in; instead he blackmails him into giving detailed recollections of his grisly past. The movie slowly becomes a chess game between the two, and soon they are blackmailing each other. As Dussander warns, Todd is playing with fire. John Ottman's opening score was disappointing, but the rest of the music and his editing were top notch. The film's primary flaw is that ten minutes or so could have been edited out of the middle portion of the film. Elias Koteas is a great actor, but his scenes go on for far too long, to the point of undermining the suspense. Tighter editing could have made this a much more popular film in my opinion, because the performances are stunning. Most of the film consists of Ian McKellan and Brad Renfro's characters in Dussander's house, and to their credit they're always compelling. Two scenes stand out for me. One is the dinner table scene, where Dussander easily wins over Todd's entire family with effortless charm. The second is where Todd forces him to wear an SS officer's uniform procured from a costumer (Dussander wryly notes that he's been promoted when he sees the rank tabs). His gradual descent back into his former self is chilling and McKellan plays it perfectly. Brandon Boyce's script and Bryan Singer's direction are dead on, except as I already mentioned more editing was needed in the middle of the film. The last half hour was masterfully constructed, and although the ending departs from the novella I preferred it. I think it had a lot more substance and was more unnerving than King's sudden, shocker ending. Does the film rely on a two amazing coincidences (Todd recognizing Dussander, and the old man sharing a hospital room with Dussander)? You bet. Does it work? I think so. Overall it's a good film with some interesting suppositions about the nature of evil, and it's a shame that it faded into obscurity.

    The movie Apt Pupil begins with a slow, but definitely solid start. Our protagonist, Todd Bowen, is an honor student at his high school. His history teacher is teaching "holocaust week" and Todd becomes intrigued and heads off to the library after class for more information. On his bus ride home, he spots a man who looks familiar- a little too familiar. Todd recognizes him to be Kurt Dussander, a Nazi who is being hunted for various crimes he committed during the second world war. After collecting a lot of evidence proving that the man he spotted was indeed Kurt Dussander, Todd decides to confront him. He gives Dussander (who is living under the alias Arthur Denker) an ultimatum; tell me all about your involvement in the holocaust, or I turn you and all the evidence over to the police. Dussander agrees to share his stories with Todd, and thus was the beginning of a confederacy that was to lead both parties involved down a path of darkness. Ian McKellan gives an amazing performance as the sarcastic and witty Kurt Dussander. In my opinion, McKellan definitely carried the movie. He was totally convincing as the seventy-five year-old former Nazi, so much so that it was almost hard to imagine him as the same man who would later play as the vivacious villain Magneto of the X-men series, or the kindhearted and powerful wizard Gandalf of the Lord of the of the Rings. Brad Renfro gave a less thrilling performance as Todd Bowen, the highly intelligent protagonist with a shade for the sadistic. Renfro was too many sullen stares, bored smirks and petulant exclamations, and too little harsh resolve, but at moments he did shine. And perhaps his moody performance was somewhat appropriate to the character, a teenage boy entangled in something from which he could not escape. I cannot accurately draw a comparison between the book and the movie, having only seen the movie, but I can say that from what I've heard and read, the book and movie should be judged on their own merits. The movie isn't so much as an adaptation as much as almost a reinterpretation or retelling of the original story, and has a drastically different ending from the book. All in all I can say that I enjoyed the film- it didn't absolutely blow me away or have me eager to watch it a second time- but it was worth the paltry sum that I paid for it and maybe more.

    Apt Pupil is a simple story about a disturbed teenage boy living in urban Los Angeles. When he discovers that a neighbor of his is a war criminal who used to run a Nazi concentration camp, he can't resist blackmailing the poor old man. However as the film develops the old man begins to turn the tables on the boy and starts blackmailing him instead. A sort of psychological game develops between the two and along with it, an odd, scary friendship. Apt Pupil was originally written by Stephen King but in my opinion, the film is superior to the novel, which I feel is excessively violent and gratuitous in how it described rape, torture, murder and killing sprees. The novel may have done a better job of describing a psychotic mind, but Apt Pupil goes to the trouble of developing said mind and showing how a child loses his innocence and deteriorates into this sociopathic shell. I also like how the film portrayed Dussander as a sympathetic character at first, although I felt the book did that aspect better. Dussander is ashamed of himself for what he has done but as the film goes on, his mind, too, starts to lose itself and he starts to embrace nazism. This film itself is just plain scary in its depiction of human nature and what we're all capable of. Apt Pupil won't be liked by many because it requires an attention span, a tolerance of disturbing and dark material, and an imagination to appreciate. People who dislike this film are missing the point. It's a wonderful story of a partnership between two individuals who each have their demons that they must face, along with some deadly secrets that could cripple their existence. This film is spellbinding and dazzling. If you can take what it dishes out, you will love it. If you have a faint heart, go watch something else. But if you want to learn how two men blackmail each other and how ultimately their plan fails, watch this movie for the psychology of it. The direction by Bryan Singer is superb and the camera-work creates some of the most powerful and tragic scenes in recent memory. The part where the man in the hospital recognizes Dussander is gut-wrenching alone. This is an amazing film. If you want to look into the darkness inside yourself, watch this movie, and then contemplate it. You'd be surprised what you are capable of.

    There have been many films and books that attempt to explain the horror that we humans are capable of. While I haven't read the Stephen King nouvelle "Apt Pupil", I can tell you this film adaptation kept my attention and threw out some new ideas I hadn't really considered. If you haven't already seen it, search for the Stanley Milgram experiment. It was a psychological test done by a Yale student back in the 1960s offering one of the most chilling explanations for the phenomenon of Nazism, a convincing illustration of how humans can do horrific things. The gist is that we convince ourselves that we're doing what we're supposed to be doing ("just following orders" or "everyone told me to do it"). The video is online on dailymotion. "Apt Pupil" surprised me by taking a very different approach which I won't ruin for you. I'll just say that it weaves a complex Machiavellian scheme, where evil is deliberate and conscious of itself. It finds its footing by creating a balance of power, reminiscent of the "mutual assured destruction" philosophy in the 80s that led the USA and Russia to stockpile enough nukes to send us to the Smurf universe. OK, enough background. Let's talk about the film already. If the premise doesn't capture you instantly, the impressive directing and musical score should suck you in with its heavy, foreboding mood. Ian McKellan (probably best known as Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings but also an accomplished Shakespearean actor) is excellent in the role of an ex- Nazi... a menacing enigma somewhere between a serial killer and a cranky grandfather. Brad Renfro appears on screen as the perfect na&iuml;ve kid with a perpetual deer-in-the- headlights expression, sort of like John Cusack in the 80s but without the laughs. The film focuses mainly on the transformation of Renfro's character. It's here where I was unconvinced, and I docked the film a point or 2. Renfro's character mutates so suddenly and drastically you'd think he sucked down some radioactive sludge. I feel a lot of his "experiments with evil" were uncharacteristic and thrown in for shock value. No matter how curious a person is, nobody goes from Pollyanna to animal mutilations in just a month or two. It was this seemingly random, inexplicable moral decay which I felt was just injected for cheap shock value. If you can get past that, the real theme emerges. The root of human evil, according to "Apt Pupil," is not random moral decay but actually a complex struggle for power. When this theme emerged in the latter half, that's when I perked up and paid attention. The story then takes on a suspenseful air, and the kid & the Nazi get into an interesting game of cat & mouse. Overall, I'll stick with the Stanley Milgram experiment for the most convincing explanation of human atrocities. But "Apt Pupil" definitely delivers some food for thought. Another film that provides insight is the criminally underrated "Exorcist III" with George C. Scott and Brad Dourif playing mind games in an insane asylum. Also check out the documentary "Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer," or on the lighter side, "Dr. Strangelove" makes an interesting commentary on why humans commit genocide. Who knows why humans kill, maim and torture. But as long as we keep investigating there may be hope for us.

    a Stephen King adaptation. good basis and seductive invitation for public. and the film is really correct work. tension, performance, levels of darkness. only problem - its message is too obvious. the story desires tell everything. and that everything is great cage for actors and viewer. because the powerful colors has not nuances. and the fight with shadows is a little delicate. but, it is a good film. that fact is not a surprise - Ian McKellen is great at all and Brad Renfro makes the best for his character - but it is something strange and confuse, unrealistic and forced. but the error must be novel author sin. short - a movie about evil. like a mirror almost clear.

    "Apt Pupil" refers to a teen (Todd) played by Brad Renfro, who discovers that a neighbor (Kurt Dussander) was a Nazi at several death camps. Todd becomes the apt pupil of Dussander. In one parallel, Dussander attempts to kill a cat, while Todd kills a pigeon. At the end, Todd threatens a guidance counselor who may expose his misbehavior, using the same threats that Dussander eventually used on him. And in the most direct parallel, Dussander thinks he has killed a man who knows about him, but Todd finishes off the man brutally. Subsequently, Dussander reflects back on the boy the same question asked of him as to how this felt. Todd's evil side blossoms as he exercises his domination over Dussander. Todd is the apt pupil, but he comes to it primed already. Dussander is like a reflecting mirror, and the more that Todd looks into this mirror, the more he becomes the Nazi character that he is seeing there. The story is unusual. Todd is a bright teen who discovers that Dussander was at the camps killing Jews. Instead of turning him in, he blackmails him. He threatens him with revealing his identity if he will only tell him stories of the death and how he felt about what he did. This is not through any kind of conscience or attempt at punishing the old man, played by Ian McKellen. Rather, the boy is fascinated by the evil and seems to want to participate and find out how it feels. As the story proceeds, Todd more and more gets drawn into evil behavior. The old man, humiliated and made to wear an old Nazi uniform, manages to turn the tables on the boy who then, toward the end of the story, scrambles to extricate himself. He succeeds, but not before having damaged his own character, or brought out its evil side so thoroughly, that there will be no going back.

    Between the making of The Usual Suspects and X-Men Bryan Singer made a small psychological thriller based on the Stephen King novella Apt Pupil. This was a story with a interesting premise but an uneven execution. In California town in 1984 Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a straight A-Level student and at the age of 16 he is already a High School student. When studying the Holocaust he discovers one of his neighbours, Arthur Denker (Ian McKellen) is actually a SS death camp commander and a wanted war criminal. Instead of telling the police Todd blackmails Denker to tell him stories about the Holocaust. Both character slowly end up playing mind games and powerplays with each other and awakening their darks demons within them. The basic idea had a lot of a potential and there were many different directions it could have gone. It could have been the boy finds out about the war criminal and the turns into an examination of the nature of guilt and evil, explore who is really the evil one in the relationship, a look a modern Nazism. The other way it could have gone is the boy could found the secret and does not know where to turn or finds its out the secret after befriending the man. The direction Apt Pupil starred off well enough as it better of wits between Todd and Denker but it slowly turns into more of a horror movie as both characters start to display the behaviour of emerging serial killers. It felt like this was a film wanting to be a thriller and horror more the being a more in depth study which it should have been and what Singer is more than capable of. It was the screenplay that lets the film down with forced moments (i.e. how Denker was discovered by the authorities) to some unrealistic character development. Renfro was a very stiff actor in the lead role and was a truly unlikeable character to lead the film. There was no real charm to him nor the charisma that a character like that needed to make you to make you care about what happened to him. But we were luckily were compensated with an excellent and dark performance from McKellen, playing a character who wants a quiet life and forced to relive his memories and by doing this his old dark and sadistic side. Singer is of course a talented director and he does bring some moments of visual flair involving dreams. There are some creepy looking scenes and the one where Todd was in the shower, the camera pans and changes filter was very well. The pacing is right throughout, Singer and his editor new when to speed up or slow down when needed and the scenes between Todd and Denker were filled with tension. A knife could have cut it as the two men tried to best the other one. There are themes about obsession, violence and the dark nature of humanity. A particular idea that was well done was how people can dream and be interest of violence and the darker elements of life but very different when actually confronted with it. Apt Pupil is the weakest film from Singer's filmography I have seen but it still a well made and compelling film. What lets it down is the weak script that was provided and it was really just a small film for Singer to keep himself busy before he got the X-Men gig (which I am thankful for).

    They take so many of Steven Kings many best sellers and turn them into movies. For the most part they miss the mark by a longshot with only around three exceptions maybe 5 depending on who you ask these include The Shining, Stand by Me, and the Shawshank Redemtion. Most of his books tuned into movies are terrible and this is one of those. The acting is alright but its nothing like the book at all. The book was very disturbing while this is not in the least disturbing. The story line is not even kept the same. It was the biggest disappointment since "IT" you should only really watch this if you have not read the book but then again Id just say read the book. This movie is about a young boy who finds out one of the elderly men in his neighbourhood is actually a Nazi war criminal. He ends up blackmailing him into telling him the horrors of the Nazi death camps because the kid has a sick obsession with it. He thinks he has all the control over the old man but the old has his tricks. Like I said this movie is no where near as good as the book. If you want a really intense disturbing book read it stay away from the movie unless there is no chance you will ever read the book.

The movie slowly becomes a chess game between the two, and soon they are blackmailing each other. As Dussander warns, Todd is playing with fire. John Ottman's opening score was disappointing, but the rest of the music and his editing were top notch. The film's primary flaw is that ten minutes or so could have been edited out of the middle portion of the film. Elias Koteas is a great actor, but his scenes go on for far too long, to the point of undermining the suspense. Tighter editing could have made this a much more popular film in my opinion, because the performances are stunning. Most of the film consists of Ian McKellan and Brad Renfro's characters in Dussander's house, and to their credit they're always compelling. Two scenes stand out for me. One is the dinner table scene, where Dussander easily wins over Todd's entire family with effortless charm. The second is where Todd forces him to wear an SS officer's uniform procured from a costumer (Dussander wryly notes that he's been promoted when he sees the rank tabs). His gradual descent back into his former self is chilling and McKellan plays it perfectly. Brandon Boyce's script and Bryan Singer's direction are dead on, except as I already mentioned more editing was needed in the middle of the film. The last half hour was masterfully constructed, and although the ending departs from the novella I preferred it. I think it had a lot more substance and was more unnerving than King's sudden, shocker ending. Does the film rely on a two amazing coincidences (Todd recognizing Dussander, and the old man sharing a hospital room with Dussander)? You bet. Does it work? I think so. Overall it's a good film with some interesting suppositions about the nature of evil, and it's a shame that it faded into obscurity.

    The movie Apt Pupil begins with a slow, but definitely solid start. Our protagonist, Todd Bowen, is an honor student at his high school. His history teacher is teaching "holocaust week" and Todd becomes intrigued and heads off to the library after class for more information. On his bus ride home, he spots a man who looks familiar- a little too familiar. Todd recognizes him to be Kurt Dussander, a Nazi who is being hunted for various crimes he committed during the second world war. After collecting a lot of evidence proving that the man he spotted was indeed Kurt Dussander, Todd decides to confront him. He gives Dussander (who is living under the alias Arthur Denker) an ultimatum; tell me all about your involvement in the holocaust, or I turn you and all the evidence over to the police. Dussander agrees to share his stories with Todd, and thus was the beginning of a confederacy that was to lead both parties involved down a path of darkness. Ian McKellan gives an amazing performance as the sarcastic and witty Kurt Dussander. In my opinion, McKellan definitely carried the movie. He was totally convincing as the seventy-five year-old former Nazi, so much so that it was almost hard to imagine him as the same man who would later play as the vivacious villain Magneto of the X-men series, or the kindhearted and powerful wizard Gandalf of the Lord of the of the Rings. Brad Renfro gave a less thrilling performance as Todd Bowen, the highly intelligent protagonist with a shade for the sadistic. Renfro was too many sullen stares, bored smirks and petulant exclamations, and too little harsh resolve, but at moments he did shine. And perhaps his moody performance was somewhat appropriate to the character, a teenage boy entangled in something from which he could not escape. I cannot accurately draw a comparison between the book and the movie, having only seen the movie, but I can say that from what I've heard and read, the book and movie should be judged on their own merits. The movie isn't so much as an adaptation as much as almost a reinterpretation or retelling of the original story, and has a drastically different ending from the book. All in all I can say that I enjoyed the film- it didn't absolutely blow me away or have me eager to watch it a second time- but it was worth the paltry sum that I paid for it and maybe more.

    Apt Pupil is a simple story about a disturbed teenage boy living in urban Los Angeles. When he discovers that a neighbor of his is a war criminal who used to run a Nazi concentration camp, he can't resist blackmailing the poor old man. However as the film develops the old man begins to turn the tables on the boy and starts blackmailing him instead. A sort of psychological game develops between the two and along with it, an odd, scary friendship. Apt Pupil was originally written by Stephen King but in my opinion, the film is superior to the novel, which I feel is excessively violent and gratuitous in how it described rape, torture, murder and killing sprees. The novel may have done a better job of describing a psychotic mind, but Apt Pupil goes to the trouble of developing said mind and showing how a child loses his innocence and deteriorates into this sociopathic shell. I also like how the film portrayed Dussander as a sympathetic character at first, although I felt the book did that aspect better. Dussander is ashamed of himself for what he has done but as the film goes on, his mind, too, starts to lose itself and he starts to embrace nazism. This film itself is just plain scary in its depiction of human nature and what we're all capable of. Apt Pupil won't be liked by many because it requires an attention span, a tolerance of disturbing and dark material, and an imagination to appreciate. People who dislike this film are missing the point. It's a wonderful story of a partnership between two individuals who each have their demons that they must face, along with some deadly secrets that could cripple their existence. This film is spellbinding and dazzling. If you can take what it dishes out, you will love it. If you have a faint heart, go watch something else. But if you want to learn how two men blackmail each other and how ultimately their plan fails, watch this movie for the psychology of it. The direction by Bryan Singer is superb and the camera-work creates some of the most powerful and tragic scenes in recent memory. The part where the man in the hospital recognizes Dussander is gut-wrenching alone. This is an amazing film. If you want to look into the darkness inside yourself, watch this movie, and then contemplate it. You'd be surprised what you are capable of.

    There have been many films and books that attempt to explain the horror that we humans are capable of. While I haven't read the Stephen King nouvelle "Apt Pupil", I can tell you this film adaptation kept my attention and threw out some new ideas I hadn't really considered. If you haven't already seen it, search for the Stanley Milgram experiment. It was a psychological test done by a Yale student back in the 1960s offering one of the most chilling explanations for the phenomenon of Nazism, a convincing illustration of how humans can do horrific things. The gist is that we convince ourselves that we're doing what we're supposed to be doing ("just following orders" or "everyone told me to do it"). The video is online on dailymotion. "Apt Pupil" surprised me by taking a very different approach which I won't ruin for you. I'll just say that it weaves a complex Machiavellian scheme, where evil is deliberate and conscious of itself. It finds its footing by creating a balance of power, reminiscent of the "mutual assured destruction" philosophy in the 80s that led the USA and Russia to stockpile enough nukes to send us to the Smurf universe. OK, enough background. Let's talk about the film already. If the premise doesn't capture you instantly, the impressive directing and musical score should suck you in with its heavy, foreboding mood. Ian McKellan (probably best known as Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings but also an accomplished Shakespearean actor) is excellent in the role of an ex- Nazi... a menacing enigma somewhere between a serial killer and a cranky grandfather. Brad Renfro appears on screen as the perfect na&iuml;ve kid with a perpetual deer-in-the- headlights expression, sort of like John Cusack in the 80s but without the laughs. The film focuses mainly on the transformation of Renfro's character. It's here where I was unconvinced, and I docked the film a point or 2. Renfro's character mutates so suddenly and drastically you'd think he sucked down some radioactive sludge. I feel a lot of his "experiments with evil" were uncharacteristic and thrown in for shock value. No matter how curious a person is, nobody goes from Pollyanna to animal mutilations in just a month or two. It was this seemingly random, inexplicable moral decay which I felt was just injected for cheap shock value. If you can get past that, the real theme emerges. The root of human evil, according to "Apt Pupil," is not random moral decay but actually a complex struggle for power. When this theme emerged in the latter half, that's when I perked up and paid attention. The story then takes on a suspenseful air, and the kid & the Nazi get into an interesting game of cat & mouse. Overall, I'll stick with the Stanley Milgram experiment for the most convincing explanation of human atrocities. But "Apt Pupil" definitely delivers some food for thought. Another film that provides insight is the criminally underrated "Exorcist III" with George C. Scott and Brad Dourif playing mind games in an insane asylum. Also check out the documentary "Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer," or on the lighter side, "Dr. Strangelove" makes an interesting commentary on why humans commit genocide. Who knows why humans kill, maim and torture. But as long as we keep investigating there may be hope for us.

    a Stephen King adaptation. good basis and seductive invitation for public. and the film is really correct work. tension, performance, levels of darkness. only problem - its message is too obvious. the story desires tell everything. and that everything is great cage for actors and viewer. because the powerful colors has not nuances. and the fight with shadows is a little delicate. but, it is a good film. that fact is not a surprise - Ian McKellen is great at all and Brad Renfro makes the best for his character - but it is something strange and confuse, unrealistic and forced. but the error must be novel author sin. short - a movie about evil. like a mirror almost clear.

    "Apt Pupil" refers to a teen (Todd) played by Brad Renfro, who discovers that a neighbor (Kurt Dussander) was a Nazi at several death camps. Todd becomes the apt pupil of Dussander. In one parallel, Dussander attempts to kill a cat, while Todd kills a pigeon. At the end, Todd threatens a guidance counselor who may expose his misbehavior, using the same threats that Dussander eventually used on him. And in the most direct parallel, Dussander thinks he has killed a man who knows about him, but Todd finishes off the man brutally. Subsequently, Dussander reflects back on the boy the same question asked of him as to how this felt. Todd's evil side blossoms as he exercises his domination over Dussander. Todd is the apt pupil, but he comes to it primed already. Dussander is like a reflecting mirror, and the more that Todd looks into this mirror, the more he becomes the Nazi character that he is seeing there. The story is unusual. Todd is a bright teen who discovers that Dussander was at the camps killing Jews. Instead of turning him in, he blackmails him. He threatens him with revealing his identity if he will only tell him stories of the death and how he felt about what he did. This is not through any kind of conscience or attempt at punishing the old man, played by Ian McKellen. Rather, the boy is fascinated by the evil and seems to want to participate and find out how it feels. As the story proceeds, Todd more and more gets drawn into evil behavior. The old man, humiliated and made to wear an old Nazi uniform, manages to turn the tables on the boy who then, toward the end of the story, scrambles to extricate himself. He succeeds, but not before having damaged his own character, or brought out its evil side so thoroughly, that there will be no going back.

    Between the making of The Usual Suspects and X-Men Bryan Singer made a small psychological thriller based on the Stephen King novella Apt Pupil. This was a story with a interesting premise but an uneven execution. In California town in 1984 Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a straight A-Level student and at the age of 16 he is already a High School student. When studying the Holocaust he discovers one of his neighbours, Arthur Denker (Ian McKellen) is actually a SS death camp commander and a wanted war criminal. Instead of telling the police Todd blackmails Denker to tell him stories about the Holocaust. Both character slowly end up playing mind games and powerplays with each other and awakening their darks demons within them. The basic idea had a lot of a potential and there were many different directions it could have gone. It could have been the boy finds out about the war criminal and the turns into an examination of the nature of guilt and evil, explore who is really the evil one in the relationship, a look a modern Nazism. The other way it could have gone is the boy could found the secret and does not know where to turn or finds its out the secret after befriending the man. The direction Apt Pupil starred off well enough as it better of wits between Todd and Denker but it slowly turns into more of a horror movie as both characters start to display the behaviour of emerging serial killers. It felt like this was a film wanting to be a thriller and horror more the being a more in depth study which it should have been and what Singer is more than capable of. It was the screenplay that lets the film down with forced moments (i.e. how Denker was discovered by the authorities) to some unrealistic character development. Renfro was a very stiff actor in the lead role and was a truly unlikeable character to lead the film. There was no real charm to him nor the charisma that a character like that needed to make you to make you care about what happened to him. But we were luckily were compensated with an excellent and dark performance from McKellen, playing a character who wants a quiet life and forced to relive his memories and by doing this his old dark and sadistic side. Singer is of course a talented director and he does bring some moments of visual flair involving dreams. There are some creepy looking scenes and the one where Todd was in the shower, the camera pans and changes filter was very well. The pacing is right throughout, Singer and his editor new when to speed up or slow down when needed and the scenes between Todd and Denker were filled with tension. A knife could have cut it as the two men tried to best the other one. There are themes about obsession, violence and the dark nature of humanity. A particular idea that was well done was how people can dream and be interest of violence and the darker elements of life but very different when actually confronted with it. Apt Pupil is the weakest film from Singer's filmography I have seen but it still a well made and compelling film. What lets it down is the weak script that was provided and it was really just a small film for Singer to keep himself busy before he got the X-Men gig (which I am thankful for).

    They take so many of Steven Kings many best sellers and turn them into movies. For the most part they miss the mark by a longshot with only around three exceptions maybe 5 depending on who you ask these include The Shining, Stand by Me, and the Shawshank Redemtion. Most of his books tuned into movies are terrible and this is one of those. The acting is alright but its nothing like the book at all. The book was very disturbing while this is not in the least disturbing. The story line is not even kept the same. It was the biggest disappointment since "IT" you should only really watch this if you have not read the book but then again Id just say read the book. This movie is about a young boy who finds out one of the elderly men in his neighbourhood is actually a Nazi war criminal. He ends up blackmailing him into telling him the horrors of the Nazi death camps because the kid has a sick obsession with it. He thinks he has all the control over the old man but the old has his tricks. Like I said this movie is no where near as good as the book. If you want a really intense disturbing book read it stay away from the movie unless there is no chance you will ever read the book.

    In the late 1990's there was a small resurgence in interest in the work of Stephen King, who had been popularised in the 1970's and '80's as the prime horror author. What was slightly more interesting about this late reprisal, was that the stories were not directly linked to the horror genre, and led to one of the most loved films of the 1990's, The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Whilst this film did not do well in the cinemas, it made it's impact on video, and therefore the more dramatic, cerebral and often realistic King adaptation's were given the green light. Hot off the success of 1995's The Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer was brought in to direct this story of power over other humans, and the devastation this can cause. Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is a top student in his high-school, and the film opens on a closing class focusing on the holocaust. The subject has clearly opened up something in the young man. Being convinced that there is an ex-Nazi officer living secretly in his neighbourhood, he decides to pay the man, Kurt Dussander (Ian McKellen), a visit. What transpires is that Todd had collected research on the subject, and uses this to blackmail Kurt into revisiting and verbalising his war stories, with particularly macabre focus on the killing of Jews. As the relationship between the two progresses it becomes clear that what fascinates Todd the most, is the power that was exerted over a people, and he has a hunger to know what this power is like. This begins with his power over Kurt; he revels in a display of power after he purchases a Nazi uniform for Kurt and makes him march on the spot. However the power that Todd exposes, is also resurfaced in the very isolated old man. Well, as this is a Stephen King adaptation, the film obviously leads to murder. But the main theme of the film is the abuses of power, and the corrupting nature of power over others. It's a very interesting film, and Singer's direction is spot on. Seeing this now also highlights the loss of a very promising actor, Brad Renfro, who unfortunately died of a drug overdose in 2008. However, without any doubt this is McKellen's film. He is note perfect for this ageing, lonely man, who has had to live with his knowledge of the concentration camps for many years. The film does tend to lose it's effect at times, and falls into a clich&eacute;d trap; for example, after Kurt has attempted to kill a homeless guy, but has to get the young Todd to finish the job after suffering a heart attack, Todd repeatedly hits the tramp with a shovel - a jump moment proceeds as the tramp gets back up after 'being killed' - yawn. However, this seems mainly to be the fault of the narrative, and is easy to overcome, particularly with the two fine central performances. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Sadly whatever made the novel good is lacking in this adaptation. Apt Pupil is a movie that feels like a new director took over every five minutes with a different idea of where the movie should go. It creates a vortex that sucks up any chance at emotional connection to the characters or overall film. What little plot there is gets rushed. There are several times when the film is too lazy or simply incapable of properly showing passages of time so it simply cuts to black 'X weeks/months later..' screens. Poor editing destroys any chance to introspect on the conversations between Kurt and Todd. One moment Kurt will be describing Holocaust victims defecating on themselves in the gas chamber and then abruptly a basketball is on screen and Todd is at school in gym class. Then a moment later his friend is talking about dates and parties in the locker-room. The on screen chemistry between Kurt and Todd is that of a wet paper-towel. The characterizations feel wrong and not in an interesting way. Think of an adult being scared of a baby. That's basically what you get. Kurt, a former SS officer who worked in both Bergen-Belsen and the notorious Auschwitz camp shrinks constantly away at Todd who is nothing but an angsty spoiled emo teenager. The movie would've been far better served with a more aggressive stance from Kurt, especially when the movie is attempting to show how evil and 'badass' the Nazis were. Even without any sort of chemistry and with Kurt being blackmailed and forced to dress up for Todd, he abruptly takes a shine to him ala Miyagi style and impersonates being his Grandfather to the guidance counsellor and the movie shifts into Todd's school life and trying to get his grades up. Then it shifts back to them hating each other. Then abruptly Kurt, who is a wanted fugitive who has intelligently and carefully concealed his identity for decades and lived a law-abiding life in the US decides to stab someone. None of it makes much sense and we care even less to figure out why because he doesn't like Todd and Todd seems to be a blossoming sociopath who doesn't like anyone except himself. Ultimately I feel like what I watched was a boy's masturbatory fantasy about having his own private SS officer to dress up, interrogate and harass mixed in with odd and boring clips of teenage high school angst. Not good for a movie that bills itself to be basically a Nazi thriller.

    'The Usual Suspects' is one of my favorite films, and 'Apt Pupil' is the closest that Bryan Singer has ever come to recreating the atmosphere and intensity of his prior work. 'Pupil' is a very flawed film, but still an entertaining and insightful one. I haven't read the Stephen King novella which it is based upon for quite some time, so I don't recall all of the differences between the two works. Todd Bowden is a seemingly above average high school student. In 1984, he is a sixteen year old high school senior who is also a star pitcher for his school's baseball team. Basically he is the kind of kid that every parent wishes they had, except that he has a hidden dark side. This dark side manifests itself in a morbid fascination with the horrific crimes against humanity that were committed by the third Reich. An uncredited Christopher McQuarrie opens the film with a fantastically written narration, asking whether the Nazis actions were the result of economic, cultural, or social influences. He then posits that it may simply have been human nature. On the bus home one night, Todd recognizes an old man named Kurt Dussander as one of the famous war criminals he has been obsessively studying. The look of recognition in actor Brad Renfro's eye as the camera pans in is subtly and fantastically depicted. Bowden goes to great lengths to ensure that he has the right man before he confronts him (to include analyzing fingerprints). Todd has no interest in turning the Dussander in; instead he blackmails him into giving detailed recollections of his grisly past. The movie slowly becomes a chess game between the two, and soon they are blackmailing each other. As Dussander warns, Todd is playing with fire. John Ottman's opening score was disappointing, but the rest of the music and his editing were top notch. The film's primary flaw is that ten minutes or so could have been edited out of the middle portion of the film. Elias Koteas is a great actor, but his scenes go on for far too long, to the point of undermining the suspense. Tighter editing could have made this a much more popular film in my opinion, because the performances are stunning. Most of the film consists of Ian McKellan and Brad Renfro's characters in Dussander's house, and to their credit they're always compelling. Two scenes stand out for me. One is the dinner table scene, where Dussander easily wins over Todd's entire family with effortless charm. The second is where Todd forces him to wear an SS officer's uniform procured from a costumer (Dussander wryly notes that he's been promoted when he sees the rank tabs). His gradual descent back into his former self is chilling and McKellan plays it perfectly. Brandon Boyce's script and Bryan Singer's direction are dead on, except as I already mentioned more editing was needed in the middle of the film. The last half hour was masterfully constructed, and although the ending departs from the novella I preferred it. I think it had a lot more substance and was more unnerving than King's sudden, shocker ending. Does the film rely on a two amazing coincidences (Todd recognizing Dussander, and the old man sharing a hospital room with Dussander)? You bet. Does it work? I think so. Overall it's a good film with some interesting suppositions about the nature of evil, and it's a shame that it faded into obscurity.

Renfro was too many sullen stares, bored smirks and petulant exclamations, and too little harsh resolve, but at moments he did shine.
