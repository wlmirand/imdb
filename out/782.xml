 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  This film tells a bitter tale of a dysfunctional family. Joshua, a cold-blooded professional killer, returns to his Brighton Beach boyhood home for a "job." He knows it will be difficult to return to the Russian-immigrant community of his youth--in his eyes, we see anticipation of the inevitable emotional pain and psychic turmoil that seeing his forsaken family and estranged companions will bring him. To do his job, and try to maintain some semblence of sanity, he has had to wall off his humanity from even himself. Seeing his kid brother, who adores him, talking with his dying mother, who still loves him, and yes, arguing with his abusive father, begins to wreak havoc with his personal defenses. As his steely demeanor begins to dissolve, we are shown the soul of a hit-man crumbling away, piece by piece. Finally, all that he now allows himself to admit that he loves is agonizingly torn away from him and he is left with the ultimate punishment for his transgressions.

    Little Odessa, also release under the title "Contract killer" is a very effectively and realistically told mobster movie, from the Russian community. It's a take on the prodigal son, here as a cold contract killer. A great watch for connoisseurs of films, and mobster film in particular. The movie stands out for great acting, directing and photography, being James Gray directorial debut. Music is excellent as well. The actors are making this a great watch. The whole film is stuffed with fabulous acting. Tim Roth and Edward Furlong is both fabulous as the brothers, as Vanessa Redgrave and Maximillian Schell is as the mother and the abusive father. I think this is some of the best I've seen from them all. The film starts up with the contract killer, being the older brother Joshua Shapira coming back to his hometown of Brooklyn after being away for years, to do a contract job. He fled town after committing a killing, which obviously is not forgotten. He meets his younger brother, Reuben, which tells him that their mother is terminally ill with brain tumor. Joshua wants to see the mother, but are not welcomed by the father, being a danger to the whole family since wanted by the mobsters. It's bleak, cold, gritty, effective and what I believe very realistic told. I was immediately sucked into the story, which is following the younger brother more than the older hit-man. it's no action movie, but a mobster movie told in the way we've seen many times. This does not stand back from these. The film builds slowly up to great scenes. It's powerful on emotions, far more than on the action. However the persons are quite cold, and so is the violence. And there isn't much hope to see in the dreary days of this family. The quote "We'll wait 10 seconds and see if God saves you" is said by Tim Roth's character before he does a killing. I would regard this is a must-see for mob film lovers, and a classic in the genre. I would likewise recommend the brilliant and effective "Eastern promises" by David Cronenberg, telling a story from the Russian mafia in Great Britain.

    The first feature of James Gray already relies on his favorite theme, which is the breaking of a family and the choices that result from it. The interesting points of the script, and more generally the movie, are the complicated relations between the members of this family. The plot, serve badly by a slow rhythm and a static staging, is very weak and doesn't manage to captivate, except for the rather good ending. This is the biggest flaw of this director, never imposing an undeniable force or power to its movies. All the characters are very cold and don't convey much emotion, therefore it is difficult to feel any sympathy, empathy or disgust towards them, and that's a shame for a drama. It is to be noted that Gray, in his following movies, will show great improvement regarding his direction, which is here quite hesitant and ultimately blend, especially with the use of cheap zooms.

    James Gray's "Little Odessa" stars Tim Roth as Joshua Shapira, a hot-headed hit man working for the Russian mafia in Brooklyn. The film takes the format of a "prodigal son returns" narrative, the exiled Roth returning home to find that he is still unwanted by his family. They all abhor him, with the exception of little Reuben Shapira (Edward Furlong), who idolises his older brother. The film ends, as most "prodigal son" tales do, with Reuben dying, paying for his brother's sins. "Little Odessa" was Gray's debut. It's a very good crime-film, well acted by the always electric Tim Roth, but the film's ethnic details are at times unconvincing and Gray falters in his final act with an obvious, overblown set piece in which little Reuben is accidentally gunned down. Gray followed "Odessa" up with "The Yards", a crime drama set in the commuter rail yards of New York City. The film's structure is similar to "Odessa", and sees Mark Wahlberg playing an ex-convict who returns home after a short stint in prison. Wahlberg attempts to stay clean, to keep his nose out of crime, but is drawn back into the criminal underworld by a friend played by Joaquin Phoenix. The film retains the "brotherhood dynamics" of "Odessa", Wahlberg playing the "good son" (they're not related) who eventually turns on his suffocating sibling. Once again the film ends with a ridiculously over-the-top death scene. While "The Yards" has a certain, smothering pretentiousness about it, convinced about its own importance (it's lit like Rembrandt, street fights are filmed like Visconti's "Rocco and His Brothers" and it's reaching for the tone of Coppola's "The Godfather"), Gray nevertheless cooks up some wonderful strokes, like a beautifully sensitive welcome-home party, a wordless assassination attempt and a fine, aching performance by Wahlberg. It's a great mixed bag. Gray then directed "We Own The Night", arguably his best crime picture. The "good brother/bad brother" motif returns, this time with Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix playing a pair of brothers on either side of the law. Phoenix's a perpetually high playboy who owns a nightclub frequented by drug-runners and mafia types, and Wahlberg's a straight-arrow cop trying to keep the streets clean. When the mafia unleashes an assassination campaign on local cops, Phoenix switches allegiances, goes undercover and attempts to take down the mob. There are touches of "Donnie Brasco", "Rush", "Point Break", "Serpico", "State of Grace", "Infernal Affairs" and every other "undercover cop" movie you can think of, but the film is beautifully lit, is atypically straight-faced and features a superb, rain-soaked car chase. Some have suggested that Gray's trilogy should be celebrated for working in a "classical", almost conventionally Greek mould. That his conventionality suggests that all his characters are at the mercy of already in place contours, their fates forgone. This may be true, but the larger issue here is that Gray's crime trilogy highlights the way in which contemporary artists struggle to conceive of a response to post-modernism. The crime movies of, say, Tarantino and Scorsese, are unashamedly post-modern, toying with and regurgitating clich&eacute;s from 1930s Warner machine gun operas and MGM crime flicks. They aren't about "crime", so much as they're pastiche jobs, jazzed up films about crime films. As a response to this aesthetic, artists who deem themselves "serious", who rightfully ask "what exactly comes after post-modernism?", tend to look backwards at what came before, as though modernism, by virtue of being modernism, is intrinsically "the solution". This leads to classically shot and written but wholly regressive fare like Gray's trilogy, which essentially unscrambles the world's Scorseses and Tarantinos and puts you right back in the 1930s. But you can't go backwards in this way; the audience will always be ten steps ahead of you and there will always be a huge chasm between your solemnity and the tired insights your film delivers. This is why true progressive works in the genre, fare like "The Wire", which actively attempts a cognitive mapping of both the world and crime, are neither modernist or postmodern, whilst possessing the vital traits of both. Philosophers have alternatively coined this new movement "neoprimitivism", "pseudomodernism", "participatism", "post-post modernism", but the one that seems to be sticking is "new modernism". So on one hand "The Wire" is modernist in the sense that it rejects post-modern nihilism (nothing matters, there is no "truth", it's just a film) and posits a world in which it is possible and necessary for individuals to make value judgements, take stands, approach objectivity, and back facts up. It is modernist in its desires to "understand", "teach", "decipher" and "make better" the world, in its emphasis on culture, society, technology and politics, and in the way it actively co-opts postmodern tropes, bending them to suit its aims. On the other hand, the series is resolutely post-modern in that it is a "television series", has multiple authors, questions agency and has a tendency toward a certain fragmentation. But though it moves away from the dictatorship of the cinema screen, "The Wire's" television format allows for a scope that may be said to be authoritative precisely because it offers a consideration and weighing of "subjectivities" and multiple perspectives. In a way, if TV comes after film, "The Wire" comes before the internet. The internet, a medium that is slowly supplanting film's reign, is of course the ultimate postmodern device. It's a shared simulacrum - tactile and interactive - but is notable in the way it simultaneously creates a postmodern environment of junk, noise and static whilst fostering a new type of modernist artist akin to a decoder. As William Gibson said way back in the 80s, future great artist will function like search engines, mapping and making sense of the detritus. "The Wire" maps, Gray goes backwards to when there was less noise. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    James Gray's unrelentingly bleak tale of a hit-man's reluctant return to his roots while carrying out a hit is the kind of film that leaves me cold. I don't mind dark movies, but for me there has to be shades of darkness throughout. This film - which is still unquestionably an astonishingly accomplished debut from Gray - simply never lets up, so that its pessimistic world view becomes exhausting. It's a world without hope or redemption, a fatalistic dirge that seems to wallow in its own misery. Roth isn't one of my favourite actors, but he's pretty good here - perhaps because he is called upon to conceal his emotions behind a blank expression. He's not a likable man - in fact he's seriously damaged and uses his gun as a defence against the world as much as he does a weapon. The entire cast give credible performances, but it's Maximilian Schell as Roth's deeply flawed father who stands out.

    I'm a long time fan of Tim Roth, who doesn't do nearly as much as I'd like him to, these days. The other British stalwart in this, the equally excellent Vanessa Redgrave was another point of interest for me. There's a real brutal efficiency to this film that makes it unlikeable but also demands respect and our attention. Roth is the roving assassin who is forced to do his next job in his old neighbourhood and that means getting reacquainted with his family: dying Mum (Redgrave), hateful and abusive Father (Maximilian Spiel), as well as impressionable younger brother (Edward Furlong). 24 year old d&eacute;butant director James Gray comes up with - and scripts - a surprisingly mature piece of crime cinema that is both poignant, moving and shocking. To my mind, the violence should rate the film at 18, not 15; the cold- blooded unfeeling of Roth's callous and unflinching "jobs" don't even give us time for any bad taste to form in our mouths. I can see that some would find this a barrier to their enjoyment in what is mostly a character- driven drama of some depth. The winter-set scenes of back street Brooklyn are chillingly authentic and bleak and these help remind us of the family's Russian roots. The father, a devout Jew, who's also having an affair often speaks Russian still, hanging to his identity the best he can, in an alienating, changing and disintegrating world. There are also some tender moments between assassin son and brain-tumour suffering mother, and of him lovemaking with his girlfriend, who wants to try to understand him and his motives. His younger brother tries to keep his own feet on the ground, whilst his sibling gradually but surely steals his innocence. Yes, it is sad - and savage but strangely rewarding, too.

    Billed as another Goodfellas, Little Odessa is the story of a mafia hit-man returning home to do a job, as well as seeing the poor immigrant family he left behind. The story is great, the movie is not. Tim Roth is fantastic as the disowned, disgraced, murderous son. Roth always gives a very strong performance and does so again here. Edward Furlong, one of my favorites, unfortunately does not do as well. I've seen him in enough things to know, it's not his fault, it's the writing. This film is so dark and painfully slow that I barely made it through. Very little is explained and the dialog is laughable, even at times non-existent. There are huge plot holes to go along with an ending that makes little sense. The writer was trying to tell his story more through imagery and symbolism in a genre that is based on action. You can't pull off something like this without explaining more of the story and using it to move things along. It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but to be honest, I was bored from start to finish.

    James Gray, who would go on to direct The Yards, We Own the Night and Two Lovers, debuted with this dark and involving tale of a family of Russian Jews in New York City torn apart by crime. Tim Roth plays the oldest son of the family who has been banished from Brooklyn after a murder he committed. Now he returns after a long absence to commit another assigned assassination. Maximilian Schell is the father who has disowned him, Vanessa Redgrave the mother dying of brain cancer and Edward Furlong the teenage brother who is growing apart from his father and longing for a strong male role model. Roth isn't a good one, of course, but Furlong becomes intrigued by criminal life. It's a deeply felt film with well written situations and characters. I can't imagine why it has such a low rating on IMDb. It seems that people are unhappy that the film makes them unhappy, which is an attitude that always pisses me off. Tarantino's Pulp Fiction came out the same year, and made the life seem like a lot more fun, even if you sometimes get shot at, and, consequently, sometimes die (but only sometimes). Pulp Fiction is perhaps the more original film, but Little Odessa is a deeper film.

    When I saw this film I was a bit bored - after all, the chief protagonist is supposed to be a hit-man, a dramatic role if ever there was one. At the same time I found myself pinned to the screen, watching an extraordinary roll-call of performance from three generations of first-class screen actors. It is a great shame that the plot is so makeshift, so flaky. Roth plays a prodigal hit-man, Joshua, who returns to the town of the title for a contract against his instinct. None of the characters, largely all suffering old, unresolved antagonisms, can help themselves but be drawn to one another on his return, combustibly, tearfully but inevitably. Edward Furlong, a truly exceptional actor in every film in which I've seen him is heartbreaking here. Roth is an empty, jittery presence and the stymied reconciliation with his mother is desperate; Vanessa Redgrave is too much actually, but perhaps it's appropriate given that she is dying. It's too miserable in the end. 5/10

    Writer/director James Gray's (We Own the Night) first film was critically acclaimed for it's cinematography and for performances by Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell. It is not an action film, even though the main character is a hit-man. It is a drama about family and shame. Mr. Orange, Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, The Incredible Hulk) plays a son who has been disowned for bringing shame on the family by his behavior. He returns to Brighton Beach to do a job, and reunites with his family as his mother lays dying. He also reunited with Moira Kelly, much to the delight of movie viewers. About the only one happy to see him was his younger brother Rueban, played by Edward Furlong (Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Pecker). Well, mom was happy, but moms are always happy no matter how bad their children are - trust me on that. Violence was at a minimum for a Russian Mafia/hit-man picture, and the focus was on the family. Maximilian Schell was excellent as the father that made piece just for a moment to allow Redgrave to see her son. Gray's first film has nuance and subtlety not often seen in a film featuring the mafia.

    Little Odessa, also release under the title "Contract killer" is a very effectively and realistically told mobster movie, from the Russian community. It's a take on the prodigal son, here as a cold contract killer. A great watch for connoisseurs of films, and mobster film in particular. The movie stands out for great acting, directing and photography, being James Gray directorial debut. Music is excellent as well. The actors are making this a great watch. The whole film is stuffed with fabulous acting. Tim Roth and Edward Furlong is both fabulous as the brothers, as Vanessa Redgrave and Maximillian Schell is as the mother and the abusive father. I think this is some of the best I've seen from them all. The film starts up with the contract killer, being the older brother Joshua Shapira coming back to his hometown of Brooklyn after being away for years, to do a contract job. He fled town after committing a killing, which obviously is not forgotten. He meets his younger brother, Reuben, which tells him that their mother is terminally ill with brain tumor. Joshua wants to see the mother, but are not welcomed by the father, being a danger to the whole family since wanted by the mobsters. It's bleak, cold, gritty, effective and what I believe very realistic told. I was immediately sucked into the story, which is following the younger brother more than the older hit-man. it's no action movie, but a mobster movie told in the way we've seen many times. This does not stand back from these. The film builds slowly up to great scenes. It's powerful on emotions, far more than on the action. However the persons are quite cold, and so is the violence. And there isn't much hope to see in the dreary days of this family. The quote "We'll wait 10 seconds and see if God saves you" is said by Tim Roth's character before he does a killing. I would regard this is a must-see for mob film lovers, and a classic in the genre. I would likewise recommend the brilliant and effective "Eastern promises" by David Cronenberg, telling a story from the Russian mafia in Great Britain.

    James Gray's "Little Odessa" stars Tim Roth as Joshua Shapira, a hot-headed hit man working for the Russian mafia in Brooklyn. The film takes the format of a "prodigal son returns" narrative, the exiled Roth returning home to find that he is still unwanted by his family. They all abhor him, with the exception of little Reuben Shapira (Edward Furlong), who idolises his older brother. The film ends, as most "prodigal son" tales do, with Reuben dying, paying for his brother's sins. "Little Odessa" was Gray's debut. It's a very good crime-film, well acted by the always electric Tim Roth, but the film's ethnic details are at times unconvincing and Gray falters in his final act with an obvious, overblown set piece in which little Reuben is accidentally gunned down. Gray followed "Odessa" up with "The Yards", a crime drama set in the commuter rail yards of New York City. The film's structure is similar to "Odessa", and sees Mark Wahlberg playing an ex-convict who returns home after a short stint in prison. Wahlberg attempts to stay clean, to keep his nose out of crime, but is drawn back into the criminal underworld by a friend played by Joaquin Phoenix. The film retains the "brotherhood dynamics" of "Odessa", Wahlberg playing the "good son" (they're not related) who eventually turns on his suffocating sibling. Once again the film ends with a ridiculously over-the-top death scene. While "The Yards" has a certain, smothering pretentiousness about it, convinced about its own importance (it's lit like Rembrandt, street fights are filmed like Visconti's "Rocco and His Brothers" and it's reaching for the tone of Coppola's "The Godfather"), Gray nevertheless cooks up some wonderful strokes, like a beautifully sensitive welcome-home party, a wordless assassination attempt and a fine, aching performance by Wahlberg. It's a great mixed bag. Gray then directed "We Own The Night", arguably his best crime picture. The "good brother/bad brother" motif returns, this time with Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix playing a pair of brothers on either side of the law. Phoenix's a perpetually high playboy who owns a nightclub frequented by drug-runners and mafia types, and Wahlberg's a straight-arrow cop trying to keep the streets clean. When the mafia unleashes an assassination campaign on local cops, Phoenix switches allegiances, goes undercover and attempts to take down the mob. There are touches of "Donnie Brasco", "Rush", "Point Break", "Serpico", "State of Grace", "Infernal Affairs" and every other "undercover cop" movie you can think of, but the film is beautifully lit, is atypically straight-faced and features a superb, rain-soaked car chase. Some have suggested that Gray's trilogy should be celebrated for working in a "classical", almost conventionally Greek mould. That his conventionality suggests that all his characters are at the mercy of already in place contours, their fates forgone. This may be true, but the larger issue here is that Gray's crime trilogy highlights the way in which contemporary artists struggle to conceive of a response to post-modernism. The crime movies of, say, Tarantino and Scorsese, are unashamedly post-modern, toying with and regurgitating clich&eacute;s from 1930s Warner machine gun operas and MGM crime flicks. They aren't about "crime", so much as they're pastiche jobs, jazzed up films about crime films. As a response to this aesthetic, artists who deem themselves "serious", who rightfully ask "what exactly comes after post-modernism?", tend to look backwards at what came before, as though modernism, by virtue of being modernism, is intrinsically "the solution". This leads to classically shot and written but wholly regressive fare like Gray's trilogy, which essentially unscrambles the world's Scorseses and Tarantinos and puts you right back in the 1930s. But you can't go backwards in this way; the audience will always be ten steps ahead of you and there will always be a huge chasm between your solemnity and the tired insights your film delivers. This is why true progressive works in the genre, fare like "The Wire", which actively attempts a cognitive mapping of both the world and crime, are neither modernist or postmodern, whilst possessing the vital traits of both. Philosophers have alternatively coined this new movement "neoprimitivism", "pseudomodernism", "participatism", "post-post modernism", but the one that seems to be sticking is "new modernism". So on one hand "The Wire" is modernist in the sense that it rejects post-modern nihilism (nothing matters, there is no "truth", it's just a film) and posits a world in which it is possible and necessary for individuals to make value judgements, take stands, approach objectivity, and back facts up. It is modernist in its desires to "understand", "teach", "decipher" and "make better" the world, in its emphasis on culture, society, technology and politics, and in the way it actively co-opts postmodern tropes, bending them to suit its aims. On the other hand, the series is resolutely post-modern in that it is a "television series", has multiple authors, questions agency and has a tendency toward a certain fragmentation. But though it moves away from the dictatorship of the cinema screen, "The Wire's" television format allows for a scope that may be said to be authoritative precisely because it offers a consideration and weighing of "subjectivities" and multiple perspectives. In a way, if TV comes after film, "The Wire" comes before the internet. The internet, a medium that is slowly supplanting film's reign, is of course the ultimate postmodern device. It's a shared simulacrum - tactile and interactive - but is notable in the way it simultaneously creates a postmodern environment of junk, noise and static whilst fostering a new type of modernist artist akin to a decoder. As William Gibson said way back in the 80s, future great artist will function like search engines, mapping and making sense of the detritus. "The Wire" maps, Gray goes backwards to when there was less noise. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    James Gray's unrelentingly bleak tale of a hit-man's reluctant return to his roots while carrying out a hit is the kind of film that leaves me cold. I don't mind dark movies, but for me there has to be shades of darkness throughout. This film - which is still unquestionably an astonishingly accomplished debut from Gray - simply never lets up, so that its pessimistic world view becomes exhausting. It's a world without hope or redemption, a fatalistic dirge that seems to wallow in its own misery. Roth isn't one of my favourite actors, but he's pretty good here - perhaps because he is called upon to conceal his emotions behind a blank expression. He's not a likable man - in fact he's seriously damaged and uses his gun as a defence against the world as much as he does a weapon. The entire cast give credible performances, but it's Maximilian Schell as Roth's deeply flawed father who stands out.

    I'm a long time fan of Tim Roth, who doesn't do nearly as much as I'd like him to, these days. The other British stalwart in this, the equally excellent Vanessa Redgrave was another point of interest for me. There's a real brutal efficiency to this film that makes it unlikeable but also demands respect and our attention. Roth is the roving assassin who is forced to do his next job in his old neighbourhood and that means getting reacquainted with his family: dying Mum (Redgrave), hateful and abusive Father (Maximilian Spiel), as well as impressionable younger brother (Edward Furlong). 24 year old d&eacute;butant director James Gray comes up with - and scripts - a surprisingly mature piece of crime cinema that is both poignant, moving and shocking. To my mind, the violence should rate the film at 18, not 15; the cold- blooded unfeeling of Roth's callous and unflinching "jobs" don't even give us time for any bad taste to form in our mouths. I can see that some would find this a barrier to their enjoyment in what is mostly a character- driven drama of some depth. The winter-set scenes of back street Brooklyn are chillingly authentic and bleak and these help remind us of the family's Russian roots. The father, a devout Jew, who's also having an affair often speaks Russian still, hanging to his identity the best he can, in an alienating, changing and disintegrating world. There are also some tender moments between assassin son and brain-tumour suffering mother, and of him lovemaking with his girlfriend, who wants to try to understand him and his motives. His younger brother tries to keep his own feet on the ground, whilst his sibling gradually but surely steals his innocence. Yes, it is sad - and savage but strangely rewarding, too.

    Billed as another Goodfellas, Little Odessa is the story of a mafia hit-man returning home to do a job, as well as seeing the poor immigrant family he left behind. The story is great, the movie is not. Tim Roth is fantastic as the disowned, disgraced, murderous son. Roth always gives a very strong performance and does so again here. Edward Furlong, one of my favorites, unfortunately does not do as well. I've seen him in enough things to know, it's not his fault, it's the writing. This film is so dark and painfully slow that I barely made it through. Very little is explained and the dialog is laughable, even at times non-existent. There are huge plot holes to go along with an ending that makes little sense. The writer was trying to tell his story more through imagery and symbolism in a genre that is based on action. You can't pull off something like this without explaining more of the story and using it to move things along. It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but to be honest, I was bored from start to finish.

    James Gray, who would go on to direct The Yards, We Own the Night and Two Lovers, debuted with this dark and involving tale of a family of Russian Jews in New York City torn apart by crime. Tim Roth plays the oldest son of the family who has been banished from Brooklyn after a murder he committed. Now he returns after a long absence to commit another assigned assassination. Maximilian Schell is the father who has disowned him, Vanessa Redgrave the mother dying of brain cancer and Edward Furlong the teenage brother who is growing apart from his father and longing for a strong male role model. Roth isn't a good one, of course, but Furlong becomes intrigued by criminal life. It's a deeply felt film with well written situations and characters. I can't imagine why it has such a low rating on IMDb. It seems that people are unhappy that the film makes them unhappy, which is an attitude that always pisses me off. Tarantino's Pulp Fiction came out the same year, and made the life seem like a lot more fun, even if you sometimes get shot at, and, consequently, sometimes die (but only sometimes). Pulp Fiction is perhaps the more original film, but Little Odessa is a deeper film.

    When I saw this film I was a bit bored - after all, the chief protagonist is supposed to be a hit-man, a dramatic role if ever there was one. At the same time I found myself pinned to the screen, watching an extraordinary roll-call of performance from three generations of first-class screen actors. It is a great shame that the plot is so makeshift, so flaky. Roth plays a prodigal hit-man, Joshua, who returns to the town of the title for a contract against his instinct. None of the characters, largely all suffering old, unresolved antagonisms, can help themselves but be drawn to one another on his return, combustibly, tearfully but inevitably. Edward Furlong, a truly exceptional actor in every film in which I've seen him is heartbreaking here. Roth is an empty, jittery presence and the stymied reconciliation with his mother is desperate; Vanessa Redgrave is too much actually, but perhaps it's appropriate given that she is dying. It's too miserable in the end. 5/10

    Writer/director James Gray's (We Own the Night) first film was critically acclaimed for it's cinematography and for performances by Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell. It is not an action film, even though the main character is a hit-man. It is a drama about family and shame. Mr. Orange, Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, The Incredible Hulk) plays a son who has been disowned for bringing shame on the family by his behavior. He returns to Brighton Beach to do a job, and reunites with his family as his mother lays dying. He also reunited with Moira Kelly, much to the delight of movie viewers. About the only one happy to see him was his younger brother Rueban, played by Edward Furlong (Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Pecker). Well, mom was happy, but moms are always happy no matter how bad their children are - trust me on that. Violence was at a minimum for a Russian Mafia/hit-man picture, and the focus was on the family. Maximilian Schell was excellent as the father that made piece just for a moment to allow Redgrave to see her son. Gray's first film has nuance and subtlety not often seen in a film featuring the mafia.

    Little Odessa, also release under the title "Contract killer" is a very effectively and realistically told mobster movie, from the Russian community. It's a take on the prodigal son, here as a cold contract killer. A great watch for connoisseurs of films, and mobster film in particular. The movie stands out for great acting, directing and photography, being James Gray directorial debut. Music is excellent as well. The actors are making this a great watch. The whole film is stuffed with fabulous acting. Tim Roth and Edward Furlong is both fabulous as the brothers, as Vanessa Redgrave and Maximillian Schell is as the mother and the abusive father. I think this is some of the best I've seen from them all. The film starts up with the contract killer, being the older brother Joshua Shapira coming back to his hometown of Brooklyn after being away for years, to do a contract job. He fled town after committing a killing, which obviously is not forgotten. He meets his younger brother, Reuben, which tells him that their mother is terminally ill with brain tumor. Joshua wants to see the mother, but are not welcomed by the father, being a danger to the whole family since wanted by the mobsters. It's bleak, cold, gritty, effective and what I believe very realistic told. I was immediately sucked into the story, which is following the younger brother more than the older hit-man. it's no action movie, but a mobster movie told in the way we've seen many times. This does not stand back from these. The film builds slowly up to great scenes. It's powerful on emotions, far more than on the action. However the persons are quite cold, and so is the violence. And there isn't much hope to see in the dreary days of this family. The quote "We'll wait 10 seconds and see if God saves you" is said by Tim Roth's character before he does a killing. I would regard this is a must-see for mob film lovers, and a classic in the genre. I would likewise recommend the brilliant and effective "Eastern promises" by David Cronenberg, telling a story from the Russian mafia in Great Britain.

    The first feature of James Gray already relies on his favorite theme, which is the breaking of a family and the choices that result from it. The interesting points of the script, and more generally the movie, are the complicated relations between the members of this family. The plot, serve badly by a slow rhythm and a static staging, is very weak and doesn't manage to captivate, except for the rather good ending. This is the biggest flaw of this director, never imposing an undeniable force or power to its movies. All the characters are very cold and don't convey much emotion, therefore it is difficult to feel any sympathy, empathy or disgust towards them, and that's a shame for a drama. It is to be noted that Gray, in his following movies, will show great improvement regarding his direction, which is here quite hesitant and ultimately blend, especially with the use of cheap zooms.

    James Gray's "Little Odessa" stars Tim Roth as Joshua Shapira, a hot-headed hit man working for the Russian mafia in Brooklyn. The film takes the format of a "prodigal son returns" narrative, the exiled Roth returning home to find that he is still unwanted by his family. They all abhor him, with the exception of little Reuben Shapira (Edward Furlong), who idolises his older brother. The film ends, as most "prodigal son" tales do, with Reuben dying, paying for his brother's sins. "Little Odessa" was Gray's debut. It's a very good crime-film, well acted by the always electric Tim Roth, but the film's ethnic details are at times unconvincing and Gray falters in his final act with an obvious, overblown set piece in which little Reuben is accidentally gunned down. Gray followed "Odessa" up with "The Yards", a crime drama set in the commuter rail yards of New York City. The film's structure is similar to "Odessa", and sees Mark Wahlberg playing an ex-convict who returns home after a short stint in prison. Wahlberg attempts to stay clean, to keep his nose out of crime, but is drawn back into the criminal underworld by a friend played by Joaquin Phoenix. The film retains the "brotherhood dynamics" of "Odessa", Wahlberg playing the "good son" (they're not related) who eventually turns on his suffocating sibling. Once again the film ends with a ridiculously over-the-top death scene. While "The Yards" has a certain, smothering pretentiousness about it, convinced about its own importance (it's lit like Rembrandt, street fights are filmed like Visconti's "Rocco and His Brothers" and it's reaching for the tone of Coppola's "The Godfather"), Gray nevertheless cooks up some wonderful strokes, like a beautifully sensitive welcome-home party, a wordless assassination attempt and a fine, aching performance by Wahlberg. It's a great mixed bag. Gray then directed "We Own The Night", arguably his best crime picture. The "good brother/bad brother" motif returns, this time with Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix playing a pair of brothers on either side of the law. Phoenix's a perpetually high playboy who owns a nightclub frequented by drug-runners and mafia types, and Wahlberg's a straight-arrow cop trying to keep the streets clean. When the mafia unleashes an assassination campaign on local cops, Phoenix switches allegiances, goes undercover and attempts to take down the mob. There are touches of "Donnie Brasco", "Rush", "Point Break", "Serpico", "State of Grace", "Infernal Affairs" and every other "undercover cop" movie you can think of, but the film is beautifully lit, is atypically straight-faced and features a superb, rain-soaked car chase. Some have suggested that Gray's trilogy should be celebrated for working in a "classical", almost conventionally Greek mould. That his conventionality suggests that all his characters are at the mercy of already in place contours, their fates forgone. This may be true, but the larger issue here is that Gray's crime trilogy highlights the way in which contemporary artists struggle to conceive of a response to post-modernism. The crime movies of, say, Tarantino and Scorsese, are unashamedly post-modern, toying with and regurgitating clich&eacute;s from 1930s Warner machine gun operas and MGM crime flicks. They aren't about "crime", so much as they're pastiche jobs, jazzed up films about crime films. As a response to this aesthetic, artists who deem themselves "serious", who rightfully ask "what exactly comes after post-modernism?", tend to look backwards at what came before, as though modernism, by virtue of being modernism, is intrinsically "the solution". This leads to classically shot and written but wholly regressive fare like Gray's trilogy, which essentially unscrambles the world's Scorseses and Tarantinos and puts you right back in the 1930s. But you can't go backwards in this way; the audience will always be ten steps ahead of you and there will always be a huge chasm between your solemnity and the tired insights your film delivers. This is why true progressive works in the genre, fare like "The Wire", which actively attempts a cognitive mapping of both the world and crime, are neither modernist or postmodern, whilst possessing the vital traits of both. Philosophers have alternatively coined this new movement "neoprimitivism", "pseudomodernism", "participatism", "post-post modernism", but the one that seems to be sticking is "new modernism". So on one hand "The Wire" is modernist in the sense that it rejects post-modern nihilism (nothing matters, there is no "truth", it's just a film) and posits a world in which it is possible and necessary for individuals to make value judgements, take stands, approach objectivity, and back facts up. It is modernist in its desires to "understand", "teach", "decipher" and "make better" the world, in its emphasis on culture, society, technology and politics, and in the way it actively co-opts postmodern tropes, bending them to suit its aims. On the other hand, the series is resolutely post-modern in that it is a "television series", has multiple authors, questions agency and has a tendency toward a certain fragmentation. But though it moves away from the dictatorship of the cinema screen, "The Wire's" television format allows for a scope that may be said to be authoritative precisely because it offers a consideration and weighing of "subjectivities" and multiple perspectives. In a way, if TV comes after film, "The Wire" comes before the internet. The internet, a medium that is slowly supplanting film's reign, is of course the ultimate postmodern device. It's a shared simulacrum - tactile and interactive - but is notable in the way it simultaneously creates a postmodern environment of junk, noise and static whilst fostering a new type of modernist artist akin to a decoder. As William Gibson said way back in the 80s, future great artist will function like search engines, mapping and making sense of the detritus. "The Wire" maps, Gray goes backwards to when there was less noise. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    James Gray's unrelentingly bleak tale of a hit-man's reluctant return to his roots while carrying out a hit is the kind of film that leaves me cold. I don't mind dark movies, but for me there has to be shades of darkness throughout. This film - which is still unquestionably an astonishingly accomplished debut from Gray - simply never lets up, so that its pessimistic world view becomes exhausting. It's a world without hope or redemption, a fatalistic dirge that seems to wallow in its own misery. Roth isn't one of my favourite actors, but he's pretty good here - perhaps because he is called upon to conceal his emotions behind a blank expression. He's not a likable man - in fact he's seriously damaged and uses his gun as a defence against the world as much as he does a weapon.

I can see that some would find this a barrier to their enjoyment in what is mostly a character- driven drama of some depth.

The father, a devout Jew, who's also having an affair often speaks Russian still, hanging to his identity the best he can, in an alienating, changing and disintegrating world. There are also some tender moments between assassin son and brain-tumour suffering mother, and of him lovemaking with his girlfriend, who wants to try to understand him and his motives. His younger brother tries to keep his own feet on the ground, whilst his sibling gradually but surely steals his innocence. Yes, it is sad - and savage but strangely rewarding, too.

    James Gray, who would go on to direct The Yards, We Own the Night and Two Lovers, debuted with this dark and involving tale of a family of Russian Jews in New York City torn apart by crime. Tim Roth plays the oldest son of the family who has been banished from Brooklyn after a murder he committed. Now he returns after a long absence to commit another assigned assassination. Maximilian Schell is the father who has disowned him, Vanessa Redgrave the mother dying of brain cancer and Edward Furlong the teenage brother who is growing apart from his father and longing for a strong male role model. Roth isn't a good one, of course, but Furlong becomes intrigued by criminal life. It's a deeply felt film with well written situations and characters. I can't imagine why it has such a low rating on IMDb. It seems that people are unhappy that the film makes them unhappy, which is an attitude that always pisses me off. Tarantino's Pulp Fiction came out the same year, and made the life seem like a lot more fun, even if you sometimes get shot at, and, consequently, sometimes die (but only sometimes). Pulp Fiction is perhaps the more original film, but Little Odessa is a deeper film.

Maximilian Schell was excellent as the father that made piece just for a moment to allow Redgrave to see her son. Gray's first film has nuance and subtlety not often seen in a film featuring the mafia.

    Little Odessa, also release under the title "Contract killer" is a very effectively and realistically told mobster movie, from the Russian community. It's a take on the prodigal son, here as a cold contract killer. A great watch for connoisseurs of films, and mobster film in particular. The movie stands out for great acting, directing and photography, being James Gray directorial debut. Music is excellent as well. The actors are making this a great watch. The whole film is stuffed with fabulous acting. Tim Roth and Edward Furlong is both fabulous as the brothers, as Vanessa Redgrave and Maximillian Schell is as the mother and the abusive father. I think this is some of the best I've seen from them all. The film starts up with the contract killer, being the older brother Joshua Shapira coming back to his hometown of Brooklyn after being away for years, to do a contract job. He fled town after committing a killing, which obviously is not forgotten. He meets his younger brother, Reuben, which tells him that their mother is terminally ill with brain tumor. Joshua wants to see the mother, but are not welcomed by the father, being a danger to the whole family since wanted by the mobsters. It's bleak, cold, gritty, effective and what I believe very realistic told. I was immediately sucked into the story, which is following the younger brother more than the older hit-man. it's no action movie, but a mobster movie told in the way we've seen many times. This does not stand back from these. The film builds slowly up to great scenes. It's powerful on emotions, far more than on the action. However the persons are quite cold, and so is the violence. And there isn't much hope to see in the dreary days of this family. The quote "We'll wait 10 seconds and see if God saves you" is said by Tim Roth's character before he does a killing. I would regard this is a must-see for mob film lovers, and a classic in the genre. I would likewise recommend the brilliant and effective "Eastern promises" by David Cronenberg, telling a story from the Russian mafia in Great Britain.

    The first feature of James Gray already relies on his favorite theme, which is the breaking of a family and the choices that result from it. The interesting points of the script, and more generally the movie, are the complicated relations between the members of this family. The plot, serve badly by a slow rhythm and a static staging, is very weak and doesn't manage to captivate, except for the rather good ending. This is the biggest flaw of this director, never imposing an undeniable force or power to its movies. All the characters are very cold and don't convey much emotion, therefore it is difficult to feel any sympathy, empathy or disgust towards them, and that's a shame for a drama. It is to be noted that Gray, in his following movies, will show great improvement regarding his direction, which is here quite hesitant and ultimately blend, especially with the use of cheap zooms.

    James Gray's "Little Odessa" stars Tim Roth as Joshua Shapira, a hot-headed hit man working for the Russian mafia in Brooklyn. The film takes the format of a "prodigal son returns" narrative, the exiled Roth returning home to find that he is still unwanted by his family. They all abhor him, with the exception of little Reuben Shapira (Edward Furlong), who idolises his older brother. The film ends, as most "prodigal son" tales do, with Reuben dying, paying for his brother's sins. "Little Odessa" was Gray's debut. It's a very good crime-film, well acted by the always electric Tim Roth, but the film's ethnic details are at times unconvincing and Gray falters in his final act with an obvious, overblown set piece in which little Reuben is accidentally gunned down. Gray followed "Odessa" up with "The Yards", a crime drama set in the commuter rail yards of New York City. The film's structure is similar to "Odessa", and sees Mark Wahlberg playing an ex-convict who returns home after a short stint in prison. Wahlberg attempts to stay clean, to keep his nose out of crime, but is drawn back into the criminal underworld by a friend played by Joaquin Phoenix. The film retains the "brotherhood dynamics" of "Odessa", Wahlberg playing the "good son" (they're not related) who eventually turns on his suffocating sibling. Once again the film ends with a ridiculously over-the-top death scene. While "The Yards" has a certain, smothering pretentiousness about it, convinced about its own importance (it's lit like Rembrandt, street fights are filmed like Visconti's "Rocco and His Brothers" and it's reaching for the tone of Coppola's "The Godfather"), Gray nevertheless cooks up some wonderful strokes, like a beautifully sensitive welcome-home party, a wordless assassination attempt and a fine, aching performance by Wahlberg. It's a great mixed bag. Gray then directed "We Own The Night", arguably his best crime picture. The "good brother/bad brother" motif returns, this time with Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix playing a pair of brothers on either side of the law. Phoenix's a perpetually high playboy who owns a nightclub frequented by drug-runners and mafia types, and Wahlberg's a straight-arrow cop trying to keep the streets clean. When the mafia unleashes an assassination campaign on local cops, Phoenix switches allegiances, goes undercover and attempts to take down the mob. There are touches of "Donnie Brasco", "Rush", "Point Break", "Serpico", "State of Grace", "Infernal Affairs" and every other "undercover cop" movie you can think of, but the film is beautifully lit, is atypically straight-faced and features a superb, rain-soaked car chase. Some have suggested that Gray's trilogy should be celebrated for working in a "classical", almost conventionally Greek mould. That his conventionality suggests that all his characters are at the mercy of already in place contours, their fates forgone. This may be true, but the larger issue here is that Gray's crime trilogy highlights the way in which contemporary artists struggle to conceive of a response to post-modernism. The crime movies of, say, Tarantino and Scorsese, are unashamedly post-modern, toying with and regurgitating clich&eacute;s from 1930s Warner machine gun operas and MGM crime flicks. They aren't about "crime", so much as they're pastiche jobs, jazzed up films about crime films. As a response to this aesthetic, artists who deem themselves "serious", who rightfully ask "what exactly comes after post-modernism?", tend to look backwards at what came before, as though modernism, by virtue of being modernism, is intrinsically "the solution". This leads to classically shot and written but wholly regressive fare like Gray's trilogy, which essentially unscrambles the world's Scorseses and Tarantinos and puts you right back in the 1930s. But you can't go backwards in this way; the audience will always be ten steps ahead of you and there will always be a huge chasm between your solemnity and the tired insights your film delivers. This is why true progressive works in the genre, fare like "The Wire", which actively attempts a cognitive mapping of both the world and crime, are neither modernist or postmodern, whilst possessing the vital traits of both. Philosophers have alternatively coined this new movement "neoprimitivism", "pseudomodernism", "participatism", "post-post modernism", but the one that seems to be sticking is "new modernism". So on one hand "The Wire" is modernist in the sense that it rejects post-modern nihilism (nothing matters, there is no "truth", it's just a film) and posits a world in which it is possible and necessary for individuals to make value judgements, take stands, approach objectivity, and back facts up. It is modernist in its desires to "understand", "teach", "decipher" and "make better" the world, in its emphasis on culture, society, technology and politics, and in the way it actively co-opts postmodern tropes, bending them to suit its aims. On the other hand, the series is resolutely post-modern in that it is a "television series", has multiple authors, questions agency and has a tendency toward a certain fragmentation. But though it moves away from the dictatorship of the cinema screen, "The Wire's" television format allows for a scope that may be said to be authoritative precisely because it offers a consideration and weighing of "subjectivities" and multiple perspectives. In a way, if TV comes after film, "The Wire" comes before the internet. The internet, a medium that is slowly supplanting film's reign, is of course the ultimate postmodern device. It's a shared simulacrum - tactile and interactive - but is notable in the way it simultaneously creates a postmodern environment of junk, noise and static whilst fostering a new type of modernist artist akin to a decoder. As William Gibson said way back in the 80s, future great artist will function like search engines, mapping and making sense of the detritus. "The Wire" maps, Gray goes backwards to when there was less noise. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    James Gray's unrelentingly bleak tale of a hit-man's reluctant return to his roots while carrying out a hit is the kind of film that leaves me cold. I don't mind dark movies, but for me there has to be shades of darkness throughout. This film - which is still unquestionably an astonishingly accomplished debut from Gray - simply never lets up, so that its pessimistic world view becomes exhausting. It's a world without hope or redemption, a fatalistic dirge that seems to wallow in its own misery. Roth isn't one of my favourite actors, but he's pretty good here - perhaps because he is called upon to conceal his emotions behind a blank expression. He's not a likable man - in fact he's seriously damaged and uses his gun as a defence against the world as much as he does a weapon. The entire cast give credible performances, but it's Maximilian Schell as Roth's deeply flawed father who stands out.

    I'm a long time fan of Tim Roth, who doesn't do nearly as much as I'd like him to, these days. The other British stalwart in this, the equally excellent Vanessa Redgrave was another point of interest for me. There's a real brutal efficiency to this film that makes it unlikeable but also demands respect and our attention. Roth is the roving assassin who is forced to do his next job in his old neighbourhood and that means getting reacquainted with his family: dying Mum (Redgrave), hateful and abusive Father (Maximilian Spiel), as well as impressionable younger brother (Edward Furlong). 24 year old d&eacute;butant director James Gray comes up with - and scripts - a surprisingly mature piece of crime cinema that is both poignant, moving and shocking. To my mind, the violence should rate the film at 18, not 15; the cold- blooded unfeeling of Roth's callous and unflinching "jobs" don't even give us time for any bad taste to form in our mouths. I can see that some would find this a barrier to their enjoyment in what is mostly a character- driven drama of some depth. The winter-set scenes of back street Brooklyn are chillingly authentic and bleak and these help remind us of the family's Russian roots. The father, a devout Jew, who's also having an affair often speaks Russian still, hanging to his identity the best he can, in an alienating, changing and disintegrating world. There are also some tender moments between assassin son and brain-tumour suffering mother, and of him lovemaking with his girlfriend, who wants to try to understand him and his motives. His younger brother tries to keep his own feet on the ground, whilst his sibling gradually but surely steals his innocence. Yes, it is sad - and savage but strangely rewarding, too.

    Billed as another Goodfellas, Little Odessa is the story of a mafia hit-man returning home to do a job, as well as seeing the poor immigrant family he left behind. The story is great, the movie is not. Tim Roth is fantastic as the disowned, disgraced, murderous son. Roth always gives a very strong performance and does so again here. Edward Furlong, one of my favorites, unfortunately does not do as well. I've seen him in enough things to know, it's not his fault, it's the writing. This film is so dark and painfully slow that I barely made it through. Very little is explained and the dialog is laughable, even at times non-existent. There are huge plot holes to go along with an ending that makes little sense. The writer was trying to tell his story more through imagery and symbolism in a genre that is based on action. You can't pull off something like this without explaining more of the story and using it to move things along. It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but to be honest, I was bored from start to finish.

    James Gray, who would go on to direct The Yards, We Own the Night and Two Lovers, debuted with this dark and involving tale of a family of Russian Jews in New York City torn apart by crime. Tim Roth plays the oldest son of the family who has been banished from Brooklyn after a murder he committed. Now he returns after a long absence to commit another assigned assassination. Maximilian Schell is the father who has disowned him, Vanessa Redgrave the mother dying of brain cancer and Edward Furlong the teenage brother who is growing apart from his father and longing for a strong male role model. Roth isn't a good one, of course, but Furlong becomes intrigued by criminal life. It's a deeply felt film with well written situations and characters. I can't imagine why it has such a low rating on IMDb. It seems that people are unhappy that the film makes them unhappy, which is an attitude that always pisses me off. Tarantino's Pulp Fiction came out the same year, and made the life seem like a lot more fun, even if you sometimes get shot at, and, consequently, sometimes die (but only sometimes). Pulp Fiction is perhaps the more original film, but Little Odessa is a deeper film.

    When I saw this film I was a bit bored - after all, the chief protagonist is supposed to be a hit-man, a dramatic role if ever there was one. At the same time I found myself pinned to the screen, watching an extraordinary roll-call of performance from three generations of first-class screen actors. It is a great shame that the plot is so makeshift, so flaky. Roth plays a prodigal hit-man, Joshua, who returns to the town of the title for a contract against his instinct. None of the characters, largely all suffering old, unresolved antagonisms, can help themselves but be drawn to one another on his return, combustibly, tearfully but inevitably. Edward Furlong, a truly exceptional actor in every film in which I've seen him is heartbreaking here. Roth is an empty, jittery presence and the stymied reconciliation with his mother is desperate; Vanessa Redgrave is too much actually, but perhaps it's appropriate given that she is dying. It's too miserable in the end. 5/10

    Writer/director James Gray's (We Own the Night) first film was critically acclaimed for it's cinematography and for performances by Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell. It is not an action film, even though the main character is a hit-man. It is a drama about family and shame. Mr. Orange, Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, The Incredible Hulk) plays a son who has been disowned for bringing shame on the family by his behavior. He returns to Brighton Beach to do a job, and reunites with his family as his mother lays dying. He also reunited with Moira Kelly, much to the delight of movie viewers. About the only one happy to see him was his younger brother Rueban, played by Edward Furlong (Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Pecker). Well, mom was happy, but moms are always happy no matter how bad their children are - trust me on that. Violence was at a minimum for a Russian Mafia/hit-man picture, and the focus was on the family. Maximilian Schell was excellent as the father that made piece just for a moment to allow Redgrave to see her son. Gray's first film has nuance and subtlety not often seen in a film featuring the mafia.
