    Officially, or unofficially, this is my 1,000th review. I chose Escape to Witch Mountain because it was the very first movie I'd ever seen. And I will never forget that experience for the remainder of my days. Picture it: Rochester, New York, probably 1978 or 1979ish, when I was either 4-5 years old. My parents worked for the town's bread and butter: Kodak. They had a "Family Day" at the plant; more specifically, in the company's gym  a rather large basketball court. There were activities abound, but the highlight, to me, at least, was the giant screen that showed: Escape to Witch Mountain. I was captivated, enthralled. Even if I wasn't the exact age of the boy, Tony (Ike Eisenmann) in the story, in my mind, I was him. It was a story of two orphaned and "special" children  a brother and a sister and their eventual journey from foster care to a filthy-rich household. (Even though I was never orphaned, I did relate to them more than just being around the boy's age in the movie. I, too, only have one sibling, a sister, whom I was very close to, like in the movie.) After exploring all the neat and super-expensive stuff given to them by their new guardians in their spacious living quarters, they quickly learn that nothing's for free. These men, their money and dogs, want more out of the two children, who have special powers, than just a family. (I wouldn't know back then, their "powers" were telekinesis, but basically, it was that plus a few more physic powers.) Eventually, they're hunted down, on the run and with the help of a grumpy old man, they head towards all they know, at least in broken memories: Witch Mountain. To my recollection, this is only the second time I've ever seen this movie, roughly 34-35 years later and yet, I remember this movie (and initial viewing) like I'd seen this yesterday. I remember everything: the score, the scenes, the adventure, the comedy, the heart and most definitely, the message. I believe this, as my very first movie experience, really helped mold me to what I am today. I believe it always made me skeptical of people who offer "free" stuff for "nothing." I think it created a fantasy within myself of being free as an orphan, with only your sibling in tow, and adventures it can lead to. And I trust it partially gave me the heart that these kids had. Now, I will say, the movie's not perfect, aside from the laughable and obvious special effects  you can see the wires multiples of time, as well as the driving green screens. But, dang, it's well near perfection. The score, the cinematography, the acting, the character depth, the originality and adventure of storytelling still, incredibly, holds up today. Despite this being released in 1975, four(ish) years prior to me seeing it, it's an extremely fun quest of two wonderful children and the great guy who didn't know he had a heart. Oh and there's a winking cat to aid in their journey. Who couldn't love that? I was actually thinking, for the first time in my 1,000(+) reviewing history of giving this a pass because it was the movie that began my love of cinema. But, as I watched it, this time as an adult and three decades later, I do believe it is an excellent film regardless of being marketed as a G-Rated family movie. I truly marveled in the storytelling and laughed a lot  never unintentionally. Now, I have seen the sort-of "remake," but never seen the sequel, Return from Witch Mountain. Perhaps I will venture into the direct sequel and reboot again now that I revisited the original. In any case, this is a great movie, even to this day. If you haven't seen it, see what I saw. As a child or as an adult. And here's to another 1,000 reviews. Oh, vey!

    Escape to Witch Mountain (1975) *** (out of 4) Brother and sister psychics (Kim Richards, Ike Eisenmann) are pretty much kidnapped by an old man (Ray Milland) and his assistant (Donald Pleasence) who plan on using their special talents. The kids eventually run away and with the help of an elderly man (Eddie Albert) they try to find out who they really are as well as escape those chasing them. This Disney film has became a rather big cult item over the past couple decades and it's easy to see why as the story is fun enough to where kids can enjoy it and adults will also have a good time since none of the story is dumbed down and even better is the fact that we get some veterans who add to the fun. There's certainly nothing ground-breaking or terrific here but it's pleasant enough of an entertaining. The main highlight of the film are the terrific special effects, which rang from various items floating through the air as well as a couple nice tricks with cars flying. These special effects look very good for the time they were made but I was really impressed in how good they look even by today's standards. The cast are all very good in their parts with Richards and Eisenmann really standing out as the kids. A lot of the movie deals with these kid's intelligence so it really helps that you can believe these actors are smart enough and this helps make the film more plausible. The supporting players are all terrific as well with Milland doing his typical bad guy performance as he screams, shouts and carries on like only he can. Pleasence is a lot of fun but Albert really steals the show as the elderly man who has a few dark secrets of his own. Albert works very well with the two kids and the three together really make this a fun adventure. The film really doesn't have any menace and that's certainly not a bad thing because it's rather refreshing seeing something so simple and pure yet at the same time smart and not just trying to be laughs out of dumbness.

This is also another movie that in my opinion requires viewing, because this is one extremely fabulous movie that is an extremely great time! This movie is not one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen, but in my opinion, it is one of my favorite movies of the 1970's, and that is saying a lot, because I have seen a lot of movie from the 1970's that in my opinion were great movies, but in the end, I decided that this movie would be among my favorites of the 1970's! In my opinion, this movie is underrated on this site, because I thought that this movie was fabulous! This movie really delivers to us what it promises, that is it promises us an extremely fabulous film with excellent results. And that is what it delivers, an extremely fabulous movie with excellent results! On the whole, this is a great movie, I was enjoying it all the way through from start to finish!

    I wouldn't call this a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but it's above average for a kid's movie. Personally I prefer The Rock's version to this one, but their is still fun to be had here. Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards are pretty good as the kids They are wooden sometimes, but they had a certain appeal about them that I liked. As dated as some of them looked, I will admit some of the special effects were still really neat to see. My favorite scene has to be when Jason O'Day's character|Eddie Albert| finds the cat and the two kids in his trailer. My main complaint about this movie, has to be that I didn't find Ray Milland or Donald Pleseance to be menacing enough, and I admire both of these actors. Performances. Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards aren't anything outstanding, but they had a certain memorable charm about them. Eddie Albert is wonderful as O'day. Grunpy, but with a hearty of gold. Ray Milland is decent, but not as menacing as he should have been, same goes for Donald Pleseance. Bottom line. I don't think I'd ever watch it again, but it was an alright time-waster. Classic it is not, but it's a decent movie. Worth a look. 6/10

    While not perfect, this Disney sci-fi drama is one of their better films of the 70s. Some of the special effects may be dated by today's standards, but some weren't that bad, and the film does meander towards the end. But essentially this film is really quite charming, with a nice story, lovely music and a well written narrative. The direction is also good, and the cinematography is on the most part beautiful. But it is the performances that make Escape to Witch Mountain worth watching. Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann are surprisingly good as Tia and Tony, while Donald Pleasance is a very good Lucas Deranian. It is Ray Milland who steals the show though, in a deliciously evil performance as Aristotle Bolt. Aside from the performances, this movie does have a lot of nostalgic value that holds up on repeated viewings. Followed by a follow-up movie Return from Witch Mountain and an inferior but average 1995 remake this is a very nice film that has enough thrills to delight kids and adults. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Disappointing Disney film where 2 children search aimlessly for their family. They had mystical powers and girl keeps seeing images of a disaster. The images she sees appear to be a boat capsizing. By the end of this film, this is not the case. The children turn out to be from outer space, just like this film. After a distinguished career, Ray Milland must have been pretty hard up to do this junk. At least, his character should have been made to be meaner. Donald Pleasence plays his lackey, and while he usually embodies evil, there is very little shown here. The always hilarious Reta Shaw, who could be as nasty as can be, is relegated to the head of the orphanage. At least, if she had terrorized the children! In other words, the evil characters here are rather benign. The children are enjoyable in their roles, but they're still not Mary Poppins, as they float around. Eddie Albert, who the children meet looks like he is ready to go back to Green Acres again. He is lovable. The ending is almost a concoction of "The Wizard of Oz," and "E.T." Guess who was totally unimpressed with this one?

    After their foster parents die, telepathic Kim Richards (as Tia Malone) and telekinetic Ike Eisenmann (as Tony Malone) must return to living in an orphanage. On an outing with ever-delightful Reta Shaw (in her last film role), the siblings' otherworldly powers are discovered, by Donald Pleasence (as Lucas Deranian), the devious driver for dastardly millionaire Ray Milland (as Aristotle Bolt). With help from heart-warmed Eddie Albert (as Jason O'Day), the children must escape from Mr. Milland, who has nefarious plans The usual Disney clich&eacute;s - cute kids, lovable animals, old pros - but significantly better than what had, by the time this film was originally released, become the norm at the studio: mediocre to poor kid fare. Children deserve quality. "Escape to Witch Mountain" is more imaginative than insulting; and, as you'll see, it could arguably be called ahead of its time. The players and animals are nicely corralled by director John Hough; "Winkie" is the cat's meow, and the instrumental puppet dance is quite memorable. ******* Escape to Witch Mountain (3/21/75) John Hough ~ Ike Eisenmann, Kim Richards, Eddie Albert, Ray Milland

    Having seen the new version of this film recently ("Race to Witch Mountain"), I cannot tell you how much of a pleasant surprise "Escape to Witch Mountain" was to me. The new version, in my opinion, lacks any kind of character development and is full of annoying characters that do nothing to help the movie. Essentially, the new version basically did away with the first 45 minutes or so of this film, which helped set up the story, develop the characters, and give us a better sense of why the kids are running away. Also, Dwayne Johnson is incredibly lacking in emotion and character compared to Eddie Albert in this movie. While I admit that most of the special effects in this film may seem cheesy by today's standards, they actually make the film even more fun to laugh at. This film came out of a couple of decades when Disney was at its height of live action movies, when even film of this type they turned out was at least worthwhile. This is an enjoyable movie, with good jobs of acting done by basically all of the characters. Appropriate for anyone in the family, exciting, funny, and likable. ***1/2 out of ****

    A nostalgic favorite for many viewers who were pre-teens in the '70s, this fantasy film inspired a sequel and two remakes! Eisenmann and Richards play a pair of orphans who wind up at Shaw's boarding school and, before long, begin to display various powers that indicate that they are not average youngsters. Eisenmann came make objects move without touching them and Richards is a telepath and can predict events before happen (as well as communicate with animals.) She can also undo locks making her, for some reason, a tad more gifted than her brother. When she saves Pleasance from an imminent accident, he realizes that his wealthy and exacting employer Milland would be most grateful to have the kids in his possession so that he can continue to make money via their gifts. Posing as their long-lost uncle, he brings them to Milland's well-appointed mansion, but, before long, the children realize that they are to be exploited and they run away, destined for the area shown on a map that Richards has hidden in her ever-present "star case," hence the title of the film. The young stars of the film give so-so performances, with Eisenmann perhaps doing a bit better, though they are thankfully free of the attitude and sarcasm that would be present in a modern day film. The duo reunited in the sequel and also worked together as brother and sister in the hysterically-titled "Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell." (Both have cameos in the forthcoming remake as well.) To a generation of young filmgoers, these two were an idealized rendition of brother & sister siblings. Milland gives the type of performance for which he was then being typecast, that of a wealthy, controlling and demanding old coot. Pleasance plays it all very straight and, as a result, his role lacks certain degrees of texture, though, again, it is welcome to see the villains of the piece provide a straightforward threat versus the hammy and over the top scenery-chewing that is the staple of today's kiddie flicks. Top-billed Albert doesn't clock in until nearly halftime, but adds a lot to the film. He plays a crusty, embittered camper whose heart is eventually warmed by the irrepressible pair of runaways. Pyle appears at the end as, quite possibly, the least expected representation of an alien imaginable! A product of its time, it is, like so many movies, riddled with contrivance and illogic, but it's also a very pleasant and endearing sort of movie. Certain things become a little trying, such as Richards repeated flashbacks, Eisenmann's harmonica playing and the extended chase sequences. However, this is made up for by the creative use of the children's powers and by the general feel of goodwill inherent in the film. The special effects range from excellent to barely adequate, but this is much preferred over the delirious and instantly unreal CGI work that proliferates now. It probably depends on the attention span of the child as to whether this would still be deemed entertaining today, though the use of puppets and animals (including a cat named Winky) in the film may aid in that endeavor. The sequel, released three years later, featured Bette Davis and Christopher Lee as the bad guys.

    This is an excellent movie, but I've often thought it was a derivative work of "The People" series by Zenna Henderson. If you like this movie or the book, you will likely enjoy Henderson's stories. Her stories involve the experiences of a variety of psychically endowed survivors from a planetary disaster who find themselves 'castaways' on Earth (sound familiar?). Most are unfamiliar with their PSI powers and are often taken for witches or demons and run out of town or worse. Many are children or young adults. Gradually, as the series matures, enclaves of those who know the whole story group together in backwoods hill country or other places where their powers are not visible. They enlist helpful earth people (like doctors) to find others of their kind and bring them 'home'. Edie Albert alludes to doing this in the movie. The bulk of Henderson's stories were written from 1952-1980 and brought together in a compilation called "Ingathering" in 1995. All of the stories are extremely well written although they are not always 'happy' during the story, they always end happy and and make you wish that was the way that people really were. Regardless of whether or not the script writer or book author was influenced by Henderson's work, the movie (and Henderson's stories) are an excellent introductions to the genre of Science Fiction for children and adults alike (the movie for kids, the stories for adults).

    I wouldn't call this a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but it's above average for a kid's movie. Personally I prefer The Rock's version to this one, but their is still fun to be had here. Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards are pretty good as the kids They are wooden sometimes, but they had a certain appeal about them that I liked. As dated as some of them looked, I will admit some of the special effects were still really neat to see. My favorite scene has to be when Jason O'Day's character|Eddie Albert| finds the cat and the two kids in his trailer. My main complaint about this movie, has to be that I didn't find Ray Milland or Donald Pleseance to be menacing enough, and I admire both of these actors. Performances. Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards aren't anything outstanding, but they had a certain memorable charm about them. Eddie Albert is wonderful as O'day. Grunpy, but with a hearty of gold. Ray Milland is decent, but not as menacing as he should have been, same goes for Donald Pleseance. Bottom line. I don't think I'd ever watch it again, but it was an alright time-waster. Classic it is not, but it's a decent movie. Worth a look. 6/10

    While not perfect, this Disney sci-fi drama is one of their better films of the 70s. Some of the special effects may be dated by today's standards, but some weren't that bad, and the film does meander towards the end. But essentially this film is really quite charming, with a nice story, lovely music and a well written narrative. The direction is also good, and the cinematography is on the most part beautiful. But it is the performances that make Escape to Witch Mountain worth watching. Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann are surprisingly good as Tia and Tony, while Donald Pleasance is a very good Lucas Deranian. It is Ray Milland who steals the show though, in a deliciously evil performance as Aristotle Bolt. Aside from the performances, this movie does have a lot of nostalgic value that holds up on repeated viewings. Followed by a follow-up movie Return from Witch Mountain and an inferior but average 1995 remake this is a very nice film that has enough thrills to delight kids and adults. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Disappointing Disney film where 2 children search aimlessly for their family. They had mystical powers and girl keeps seeing images of a disaster. The images she sees appear to be a boat capsizing. By the end of this film, this is not the case. The children turn out to be from outer space, just like this film. After a distinguished career, Ray Milland must have been pretty hard up to do this junk. At least, his character should have been made to be meaner. Donald Pleasence plays his lackey, and while he usually embodies evil, there is very little shown here. The always hilarious Reta Shaw, who could be as nasty as can be, is relegated to the head of the orphanage. At least, if she had terrorized the children! In other words, the evil characters here are rather benign. The children are enjoyable in their roles, but they're still not Mary Poppins, as they float around. Eddie Albert, who the children meet looks like he is ready to go back to Green Acres again. He is lovable. The ending is almost a concoction of "The Wizard of Oz," and "E.T." Guess who was totally unimpressed with this one?

    After their foster parents die, telepathic Kim Richards (as Tia Malone) and telekinetic Ike Eisenmann (as Tony Malone) must return to living in an orphanage. On an outing with ever-delightful Reta Shaw (in her last film role), the siblings' otherworldly powers are discovered, by Donald Pleasence (as Lucas Deranian), the devious driver for dastardly millionaire Ray Milland (as Aristotle Bolt). With help from heart-warmed Eddie Albert (as Jason O'Day), the children must escape from Mr. Milland, who has nefarious plans The usual Disney clich&eacute;s - cute kids, lovable animals, old pros - but significantly better than what had, by the time this film was originally released, become the norm at the studio: mediocre to poor kid fare. Children deserve quality. "Escape to Witch Mountain" is more imaginative than insulting; and, as you'll see, it could arguably be called ahead of its time. The players and animals are nicely corralled by director John Hough; "Winkie" is the cat's meow, and the instrumental puppet dance is quite memorable. ******* Escape to Witch Mountain (3/21/75) John Hough ~ Ike Eisenmann, Kim Richards, Eddie Albert, Ray Milland

    Having seen the new version of this film recently ("Race to Witch Mountain"), I cannot tell you how much of a pleasant surprise "Escape to Witch Mountain" was to me. The new version, in my opinion, lacks any kind of character development and is full of annoying characters that do nothing to help the movie. Essentially, the new version basically did away with the first 45 minutes or so of this film, which helped set up the story, develop the characters, and give us a better sense of why the kids are running away. Also, Dwayne Johnson is incredibly lacking in emotion and character compared to Eddie Albert in this movie. While I admit that most of the special effects in this film may seem cheesy by today's standards, they actually make the film even more fun to laugh at. This film came out of a couple of decades when Disney was at its height of live action movies, when even film of this type they turned out was at least worthwhile. This is an enjoyable movie, with good jobs of acting done by basically all of the characters. Appropriate for anyone in the family, exciting, funny, and likable. ***1/2 out of ****

    A nostalgic favorite for many viewers who were pre-teens in the '70s, this fantasy film inspired a sequel and two remakes! Eisenmann and Richards play a pair of orphans who wind up at Shaw's boarding school and, before long, begin to display various powers that indicate that they are not average youngsters. Eisenmann came make objects move without touching them and Richards is a telepath and can predict events before happen (as well as communicate with animals.) She can also undo locks making her, for some reason, a tad more gifted than her brother. When she saves Pleasance from an imminent accident, he realizes that his wealthy and exacting employer Milland would be most grateful to have the kids in his possession so that he can continue to make money via their gifts. Posing as their long-lost uncle, he brings them to Milland's well-appointed mansion, but, before long, the children realize that they are to be exploited and they run away, destined for the area shown on a map that Richards has hidden in her ever-present "star case," hence the title of the film. The young stars of the film give so-so performances, with Eisenmann perhaps doing a bit better, though they are thankfully free of the attitude and sarcasm that would be present in a modern day film. The duo reunited in the sequel and also worked together as brother and sister in the hysterically-titled "Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell." (Both have cameos in the forthcoming remake as well.) To a generation of young filmgoers, these two were an idealized rendition of brother & sister siblings. Milland gives the type of performance for which he was then being typecast, that of a wealthy, controlling and demanding old coot. Pleasance plays it all very straight and, as a result, his role lacks certain degrees of texture, though, again, it is welcome to see the villains of the piece provide a straightforward threat versus the hammy and over the top scenery-chewing that is the staple of today's kiddie flicks. Top-billed Albert doesn't clock in until nearly halftime, but adds a lot to the film. He plays a crusty, embittered camper whose heart is eventually warmed by the irrepressible pair of runaways. Pyle appears at the end as, quite possibly, the least expected representation of an alien imaginable! A product of its time, it is, like so many movies, riddled with contrivance and illogic, but it's also a very pleasant and endearing sort of movie. Certain things become a little trying, such as Richards repeated flashbacks, Eisenmann's harmonica playing and the extended chase sequences. However, this is made up for by the creative use of the children's powers and by the general feel of goodwill inherent in the film. The special effects range from excellent to barely adequate, but this is much preferred over the delirious and instantly unreal CGI work that proliferates now. It probably depends on the attention span of the child as to whether this would still be deemed entertaining today, though the use of puppets and animals (including a cat named Winky) in the film may aid in that endeavor. The sequel, released three years later, featured Bette Davis and Christopher Lee as the bad guys.

    This is an excellent movie, but I've often thought it was a derivative work of "The People" series by Zenna Henderson. If you like this movie or the book, you will likely enjoy Henderson's stories. Her stories involve the experiences of a variety of psychically endowed survivors from a planetary disaster who find themselves 'castaways' on Earth (sound familiar?). Most are unfamiliar with their PSI powers and are often taken for witches or demons and run out of town or worse. Many are children or young adults. Gradually, as the series matures, enclaves of those who know the whole story group together in backwoods hill country or other places where their powers are not visible. They enlist helpful earth people (like doctors) to find others of their kind and bring them 'home'. Edie Albert alludes to doing this in the movie. The bulk of Henderson's stories were written from 1952-1980 and brought together in a compilation called "Ingathering" in 1995. All of the stories are extremely well written although they are not always 'happy' during the story, they always end happy and and make you wish that was the way that people really were. Regardless of whether or not the script writer or book author was influenced by Henderson's work, the movie (and Henderson's stories) are an excellent introductions to the genre of Science Fiction for children and adults alike (the movie for kids, the stories for adults).

    Officially, or unofficially, this is my 1,000th review. I chose Escape to Witch Mountain because it was the very first movie I'd ever seen. And I will never forget that experience for the remainder of my days. Picture it: Rochester, New York, probably 1978 or 1979ish, when I was either 4-5 years old. My parents worked for the town's bread and butter: Kodak. They had a "Family Day" at the plant; more specifically, in the company's gym  a rather large basketball court. There were activities abound, but the highlight, to me, at least, was the giant screen that showed: Escape to Witch Mountain. I was captivated, enthralled. Even if I wasn't the exact age of the boy, Tony (Ike Eisenmann) in the story, in my mind, I was him. It was a story of two orphaned and "special" children  a brother and a sister and their eventual journey from foster care to a filthy-rich household. (Even though I was never orphaned, I did relate to them more than just being around the boy's age in the movie. I, too, only have one sibling, a sister, whom I was very close to, like in the movie.) After exploring all the neat and super-expensive stuff given to them by their new guardians in their spacious living quarters, they quickly learn that nothing's for free. These men, their money and dogs, want more out of the two children, who have special powers, than just a family. (I wouldn't know back then, their "powers" were telekinesis, but basically, it was that plus a few more physic powers.) Eventually, they're hunted down, on the run and with the help of a grumpy old man, they head towards all they know, at least in broken memories: Witch Mountain. To my recollection, this is only the second time I've ever seen this movie, roughly 34-35 years later and yet, I remember this movie (and initial viewing) like I'd seen this yesterday. I remember everything: the score, the scenes, the adventure, the comedy, the heart and most definitely, the message. I believe this, as my very first movie experience, really helped mold me to what I am today. I believe it always made me skeptical of people who offer "free" stuff for "nothing." I think it created a fantasy within myself of being free as an orphan, with only your sibling in tow, and adventures it can lead to. And I trust it partially gave me the heart that these kids had. Now, I will say, the movie's not perfect, aside from the laughable and obvious special effects  you can see the wires multiples of time, as well as the driving green screens. But, dang, it's well near perfection. The score, the cinematography, the acting, the character depth, the originality and adventure of storytelling still, incredibly, holds up today. Despite this being released in 1975, four(ish) years prior to me seeing it, it's an extremely fun quest of two wonderful children and the great guy who didn't know he had a heart. Oh and there's a winking cat to aid in their journey. Who couldn't love that? I was actually thinking, for the first time in my 1,000(+) reviewing history of giving this a pass because it was the movie that began my love of cinema. But, as I watched it, this time as an adult and three decades later, I do believe it is an excellent film regardless of being marketed as a G-Rated family movie. I truly marveled in the storytelling and laughed a lot  never unintentionally. Now, I have seen the sort-of "remake," but never seen the sequel, Return from Witch Mountain. Perhaps I will venture into the direct sequel and reboot again now that I revisited the original. In any case, this is a great movie, even to this day. If you haven't seen it, see what I saw. As a child or as an adult. And here's to another 1,000 reviews. Oh, vey!

    Escape to Witch Mountain (1975) *** (out of 4) Brother and sister psychics (Kim Richards, Ike Eisenmann) are pretty much kidnapped by an old man (Ray Milland) and his assistant (Donald Pleasence) who plan on using their special talents. The kids eventually run away and with the help of an elderly man (Eddie Albert) they try to find out who they really are as well as escape those chasing them. This Disney film has became a rather big cult item over the past couple decades and it's easy to see why as the story is fun enough to where kids can enjoy it and adults will also have a good time since none of the story is dumbed down and even better is the fact that we get some veterans who add to the fun. There's certainly nothing ground-breaking or terrific here but it's pleasant enough of an entertaining. The main highlight of the film are the terrific special effects, which rang from various items floating through the air as well as a couple nice tricks with cars flying. These special effects look very good for the time they were made but I was really impressed in how good they look even by today's standards. The cast are all very good in their parts with Richards and Eisenmann really standing out as the kids. A lot of the movie deals with these kid's intelligence so it really helps that you can believe these actors are smart enough and this helps make the film more plausible. The supporting players are all terrific as well with Milland doing his typical bad guy performance as he screams, shouts and carries on like only he can. Pleasence is a lot of fun but Albert really steals the show as the elderly man who has a few dark secrets of his own. Albert works very well with the two kids and the three together really make this a fun adventure. The film really doesn't have any menace and that's certainly not a bad thing because it's rather refreshing seeing something so simple and pure yet at the same time smart and not just trying to be laughs out of dumbness.

Most are unfamiliar with their PSI powers and are often taken for witches or demons and run out of town or worse. Many are children or young adults. Gradually, as the series matures, enclaves of those who know the whole story group together in backwoods hill country or other places where their powers are not visible. They enlist helpful earth people (like doctors) to find others of their kind and bring them 'home'. Edie Albert alludes to doing this in the movie. The bulk of Henderson's stories were written from 1952-1980 and brought together in a compilation called "Ingathering" in 1995. All of the stories are extremely well written although they are not always 'happy' during the story, they always end happy and and make you wish that was the way that people really were. Regardless of whether or not the script writer or book author was influenced by Henderson's work, the movie (and Henderson's stories) are an excellent introductions to the genre of Science Fiction for children and adults alike (the movie for kids, the stories for adults).

    Officially, or unofficially, this is my 1,000th review. I chose Escape to Witch Mountain because it was the very first movie I'd ever seen. And I will never forget that experience for the remainder of my days. Picture it: Rochester, New York, probably 1978 or 1979ish, when I was either 4-5 years old. My parents worked for the town's bread and butter: Kodak. They had a "Family Day" at the plant; more specifically, in the company's gym  a rather large basketball court. There were activities abound, but the highlight, to me, at least, was the giant screen that showed: Escape to Witch Mountain. I was captivated, enthralled. Even if I wasn't the exact age of the boy, Tony (Ike Eisenmann) in the story, in my mind, I was him. It was a story of two orphaned and "special" children  a brother and a sister and their eventual journey from foster care to a filthy-rich household. (Even though I was never orphaned, I did relate to them more than just being around the boy's age in the movie. I, too, only have one sibling, a sister, whom I was very close to, like in the movie.) After exploring all the neat and super-expensive stuff given to them by their new guardians in their spacious living quarters, they quickly learn that nothing's for free. These men, their money and dogs, want more out of the two children, who have special powers, than just a family. (I wouldn't know back then, their "powers" were telekinesis, but basically, it was that plus a few more physic powers.) Eventually, they're hunted down, on the run and with the help of a grumpy old man, they head towards all they know, at least in broken memories: Witch Mountain. To my recollection, this is only the second time I've ever seen this movie, roughly 34-35 years later and yet, I remember this movie (and initial viewing) like I'd seen this yesterday. I remember everything: the score, the scenes, the adventure, the comedy, the heart and most definitely, the message. I believe this, as my very first movie experience, really helped mold me to what I am today. I believe it always made me skeptical of people who offer "free" stuff for "nothing." I think it created a fantasy within myself of being free as an orphan, with only your sibling in tow, and adventures it can lead to. And I trust it partially gave me the heart that these kids had. Now, I will say, the movie's not perfect, aside from the laughable and obvious special effects  you can see the wires multiples of time, as well as the driving green screens. But, dang, it's well near perfection. The score, the cinematography, the acting, the character depth, the originality and adventure of storytelling still, incredibly, holds up today. Despite this being released in 1975, four(ish) years prior to me seeing it, it's an extremely fun quest of two wonderful children and the great guy who didn't know he had a heart. Oh and there's a winking cat to aid in their journey. Who couldn't love that? I was actually thinking, for the first time in my 1,000(+) reviewing history of giving this a pass because it was the movie that began my love of cinema. But, as I watched it, this time as an adult and three decades later, I do believe it is an excellent film regardless of being marketed as a G-Rated family movie. I truly marveled in the storytelling and laughed a lot  never unintentionally. Now, I have seen the sort-of "remake," but never seen the sequel, Return from Witch Mountain. Perhaps I will venture into the direct sequel and reboot again now that I revisited the original. In any case, this is a great movie, even to this day. If you haven't seen it, see what I saw. As a child or as an adult. And here's to another 1,000 reviews. Oh, vey!

    Escape to Witch Mountain (1975) *** (out of 4) Brother and sister psychics (Kim Richards, Ike Eisenmann) are pretty much kidnapped by an old man (Ray Milland) and his assistant (Donald Pleasence) who plan on using their special talents. The kids eventually run away and with the help of an elderly man (Eddie Albert) they try to find out who they really are as well as escape those chasing them. This Disney film has became a rather big cult item over the past couple decades and it's easy to see why as the story is fun enough to where kids can enjoy it and adults will also have a good time since none of the story is dumbed down and even better is the fact that we get some veterans who add to the fun. There's certainly nothing ground-breaking or terrific here but it's pleasant enough of an entertaining. The main highlight of the film are the terrific special effects, which rang from various items floating through the air as well as a couple nice tricks with cars flying. These special effects look very good for the time they were made but I was really impressed in how good they look even by today's standards. The cast are all very good in their parts with Richards and Eisenmann really standing out as the kids. A lot of the movie deals with these kid's intelligence so it really helps that you can believe these actors are smart enough and this helps make the film more plausible. The supporting players are all terrific as well with Milland doing his typical bad guy performance as he screams, shouts and carries on like only he can. Pleasence is a lot of fun but Albert really steals the show as the elderly man who has a few dark secrets of his own. Albert works very well with the two kids and the three together really make this a fun adventure. The film really doesn't have any menace and that's certainly not a bad thing because it's rather refreshing seeing something so simple and pure yet at the same time smart and not just trying to be laughs out of dumbness.

This is also another movie that in my opinion requires viewing, because this is one extremely fabulous movie that is an extremely great time! This movie is not one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen, but in my opinion, it is one of my favorite movies of the 1970's, and that is saying a lot, because I have seen a lot of movie from the 1970's that in my opinion were great movies, but in the end, I decided that this movie would be among my favorites of the 1970's! In my opinion, this movie is underrated on this site, because I thought that this movie was fabulous! This movie really delivers to us what it promises, that is it promises us an extremely fabulous film with excellent results. And that is what it delivers, an extremely fabulous movie with excellent results! On the whole, this is a great movie, I was enjoying it all the way through from start to finish!

    I wouldn't call this a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but it's above average for a kid's movie. Personally I prefer The Rock's version to this one, but their is still fun to be had here. Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards are pretty good as the kids They are wooden sometimes, but they had a certain appeal about them that I liked. As dated as some of them looked, I will admit some of the special effects were still really neat to see. My favorite scene has to be when Jason O'Day's character|Eddie Albert| finds the cat and the two kids in his trailer. My main complaint about this movie, has to be that I didn't find Ray Milland or Donald Pleseance to be menacing enough, and I admire both of these actors. Performances. Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards aren't anything outstanding, but they had a certain memorable charm about them. Eddie Albert is wonderful as O'day. Grunpy, but with a hearty of gold. Ray Milland is decent, but not as menacing as he should have been, same goes for Donald Pleseance. Bottom line. I don't think I'd ever watch it again, but it was an alright time-waster. Classic it is not, but it's a decent movie. Worth a look. 6/10

    While not perfect, this Disney sci-fi drama is one of their better films of the 70s. Some of the special effects may be dated by today's standards, but some weren't that bad, and the film does meander towards the end. But essentially this film is really quite charming, with a nice story, lovely music and a well written narrative. The direction is also good, and the cinematography is on the most part beautiful. But it is the performances that make Escape to Witch Mountain worth watching. Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann are surprisingly good as Tia and Tony, while Donald Pleasance is a very good Lucas Deranian. It is Ray Milland who steals the show though, in a deliciously evil performance as Aristotle Bolt. Aside from the performances, this movie does have a lot of nostalgic value that holds up on repeated viewings. Followed by a follow-up movie Return from Witch Mountain and an inferior but average 1995 remake this is a very nice film that has enough thrills to delight kids and adults. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Disappointing Disney film where 2 children search aimlessly for their family. They had mystical powers and girl keeps seeing images of a disaster. The images she sees appear to be a boat capsizing. By the end of this film, this is not the case. The children turn out to be from outer space, just like this film. After a distinguished career, Ray Milland must have been pretty hard up to do this junk. At least, his character should have been made to be meaner. Donald Pleasence plays his lackey, and while he usually embodies evil, there is very little shown here. The always hilarious Reta Shaw, who could be as nasty as can be, is relegated to the head of the orphanage. At least, if she had terrorized the children! In other words, the evil characters here are rather benign. The children are enjoyable in their roles, but they're still not Mary Poppins, as they float around. Eddie Albert, who the children meet looks like he is ready to go back to Green Acres again. He is lovable. The ending is almost a concoction of "The Wizard of Oz," and "E.T." Guess who was totally unimpressed with this one?

    After their foster parents die, telepathic Kim Richards (as Tia Malone) and telekinetic Ike Eisenmann (as Tony Malone) must return to living in an orphanage. On an outing with ever-delightful Reta Shaw (in her last film role), the siblings' otherworldly powers are discovered, by Donald Pleasence (as Lucas Deranian), the devious driver for dastardly millionaire Ray Milland (as Aristotle Bolt). With help from heart-warmed Eddie Albert (as Jason O'Day), the children must escape from Mr. Milland, who has nefarious plans The usual Disney clich&eacute;s - cute kids, lovable animals, old pros - but significantly better than what had, by the time this film was originally released, become the norm at the studio: mediocre to poor kid fare. Children deserve quality. "Escape to Witch Mountain" is more imaginative than insulting; and, as you'll see, it could arguably be called ahead of its time. The players and animals are nicely corralled by director John Hough; "Winkie" is the cat's meow, and the instrumental puppet dance is quite memorable. ******* Escape to Witch Mountain (3/21/75) John Hough ~ Ike Eisenmann, Kim Richards, Eddie Albert, Ray Milland

    Having seen the new version of this film recently ("Race to Witch Mountain"), I cannot tell you how much of a pleasant surprise "Escape to Witch Mountain" was to me. The new version, in my opinion, lacks any kind of character development and is full of annoying characters that do nothing to help the movie. Essentially, the new version basically did away with the first 45 minutes or so of this film, which helped set up the story, develop the characters, and give us a better sense of why the kids are running away. Also, Dwayne Johnson is incredibly lacking in emotion and character compared to Eddie Albert in this movie. While I admit that most of the special effects in this film may seem cheesy by today's standards, they actually make the film even more fun to laugh at. This film came out of a couple of decades when Disney was at its height of live action movies, when even film of this type they turned out was at least worthwhile. This is an enjoyable movie, with good jobs of acting done by basically all of the characters. Appropriate for anyone in the family, exciting, funny, and likable. ***1/2 out of ****

    A nostalgic favorite for many viewers who were pre-teens in the '70s, this fantasy film inspired a sequel and two remakes! Eisenmann and Richards play a pair of orphans who wind up at Shaw's boarding school and, before long, begin to display various powers that indicate that they are not average youngsters. Eisenmann came make objects move without touching them and Richards is a telepath and can predict events before happen (as well as communicate with animals.) She can also undo locks making her, for some reason, a tad more gifted than her brother. When she saves Pleasance from an imminent accident, he realizes that his wealthy and exacting employer Milland would be most grateful to have the kids in his possession so that he can continue to make money via their gifts. Posing as their long-lost uncle, he brings them to Milland's well-appointed mansion, but, before long, the children realize that they are to be exploited and they run away, destined for the area shown on a map that Richards has hidden in her ever-present "star case," hence the title of the film. The young stars of the film give so-so performances, with Eisenmann perhaps doing a bit better, though they are thankfully free of the attitude and sarcasm that would be present in a modern day film. The duo reunited in the sequel and also worked together as brother and sister in the hysterically-titled "Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell." (Both have cameos in the forthcoming remake as well.) To a generation of young filmgoers, these two were an idealized rendition of brother & sister siblings. Milland gives the type of performance for which he was then being typecast, that of a wealthy, controlling and demanding old coot. Pleasance plays it all very straight and, as a result, his role lacks certain degrees of texture, though, again, it is welcome to see the villains of the piece provide a straightforward threat versus the hammy and over the top scenery-chewing that is the staple of today's kiddie flicks. Top-billed Albert doesn't clock in until nearly halftime, but adds a lot to the film. He plays a crusty, embittered camper whose heart is eventually warmed by the irrepressible pair of runaways. Pyle appears at the end as, quite possibly, the least expected representation of an alien imaginable! A product of its time, it is, like so many movies, riddled with contrivance and illogic, but it's also a very pleasant and endearing sort of movie. Certain things become a little trying, such as Richards repeated flashbacks, Eisenmann's harmonica playing and the extended chase sequences. However, this is made up for by the creative use of the children's powers and by the general feel of goodwill inherent in the film. The special effects range from excellent to barely adequate, but this is much preferred over the delirious and instantly unreal CGI work that proliferates now. It probably depends on the attention span of the child as to whether this would still be deemed entertaining today, though the use of puppets and animals (including a cat named Winky) in the film may aid in that endeavor. The sequel, released three years later, featured Bette Davis and Christopher Lee as the bad guys.

    This is an excellent movie, but I've often thought it was a derivative work of "The People" series by Zenna Henderson. If you like this movie or the book, you will likely enjoy Henderson's stories. Her stories involve the experiences of a variety of psychically endowed survivors from a planetary disaster who find themselves 'castaways' on Earth (sound familiar?). Most are unfamiliar with their PSI powers and are often taken for witches or demons and run out of town or worse. Many are children or young adults. Gradually, as the series matures, enclaves of those who know the whole story group together in backwoods hill country or other places where their powers are not visible. They enlist helpful earth people (like doctors) to find others of their kind and bring them 'home'. Edie Albert alludes to doing this in the movie. The bulk of Henderson's stories were written from 1952-1980 and brought together in a compilation called "Ingathering" in 1995. All of the stories are extremely well written although they are not always 'happy' during the story, they always end happy and and make you wish that was the way that people really were. Regardless of whether or not the script writer or book author was influenced by Henderson's work, the movie (and Henderson's stories) are an excellent introductions to the genre of Science Fiction for children and adults alike (the movie for kids, the stories for adults).

Ray Milland is decent, but not as menacing as he should have been, same goes for Donald Pleseance. Bottom line. I don't think I'd ever watch it again, but it was an alright time-waster. Classic it is not, but it's a decent movie. Worth a look. 6/10

    While not perfect, this Disney sci-fi drama is one of their better films of the 70s. Some of the special effects may be dated by today's standards, but some weren't that bad, and the film does meander towards the end. But essentially this film is really quite charming, with a nice story, lovely music and a well written narrative. The direction is also good, and the cinematography is on the most part beautiful. But it is the performances that make Escape to Witch Mountain worth watching. Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann are surprisingly good as Tia and Tony, while Donald Pleasance is a very good Lucas Deranian. It is Ray Milland who steals the show though, in a deliciously evil performance as Aristotle Bolt. Aside from the performances, this movie does have a lot of nostalgic value that holds up on repeated viewings. Followed by a follow-up movie Return from Witch Mountain and an inferior but average 1995 remake this is a very nice film that has enough thrills to delight kids and adults. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Disappointing Disney film where 2 children search aimlessly for their family. They had mystical powers and girl keeps seeing images of a disaster. The images she sees appear to be a boat capsizing. By the end of this film, this is not the case. The children turn out to be from outer space, just like this film. After a distinguished career, Ray Milland must have been pretty hard up to do this junk. At least, his character should have been made to be meaner. Donald Pleasence plays his lackey, and while he usually embodies evil, there is very little shown here. The always hilarious Reta Shaw, who could be as nasty as can be, is relegated to the head of the orphanage. At least, if she had terrorized the children! In other words, the evil characters here are rather benign. The children are enjoyable in their roles, but they're still not Mary Poppins, as they float around. Eddie Albert, who the children meet looks like he is ready to go back to Green Acres again. He is lovable. The ending is almost a concoction of "The Wizard of Oz," and "E.T." Guess who was totally unimpressed with this one?

    After their foster parents die, telepathic Kim Richards (as Tia Malone) and telekinetic Ike Eisenmann (as Tony Malone) must return to living in an orphanage. On an outing with ever-delightful Reta Shaw (in her last film role), the siblings' otherworldly powers are discovered, by Donald Pleasence (as Lucas Deranian), the devious driver for dastardly millionaire Ray Milland (as Aristotle Bolt). With help from heart-warmed Eddie Albert (as Jason O'Day), the children must escape from Mr. Milland, who has nefarious plans The usual Disney clich&eacute;s - cute kids, lovable animals, old pros - but significantly better than what had, by the time this film was originally released, become the norm at the studio: mediocre to poor kid fare. Children deserve quality. "Escape to Witch Mountain" is more imaginative than insulting; and, as you'll see, it could arguably be called ahead of its time. The players and animals are nicely corralled by director John Hough; "Winkie" is the cat's meow, and the instrumental puppet dance is quite memorable. ******* Escape to Witch Mountain (3/21/75) John Hough ~ Ike Eisenmann, Kim Richards, Eddie Albert, Ray Milland

    Having seen the new version of this film recently ("Race to Witch Mountain"), I cannot tell you how much of a pleasant surprise "Escape to Witch Mountain" was to me. The new version, in my opinion, lacks any kind of character development and is full of annoying characters that do nothing to help the movie. Essentially, the new version basically did away with the first 45 minutes or so of this film, which helped set up the story, develop the characters, and give us a better sense of why the kids are running away. Also, Dwayne Johnson is incredibly lacking in emotion and character compared to Eddie Albert in this movie. While I admit that most of the special effects in this film may seem cheesy by today's standards, they actually make the film even more fun to laugh at. This film came out of a couple of decades when Disney was at its height of live action movies, when even film of this type they turned out was at least worthwhile. This is an enjoyable movie, with good jobs of acting done by basically all of the characters. Appropriate for anyone in the family, exciting, funny, and likable. ***1/2 out of ****

    A nostalgic favorite for many viewers who were pre-teens in the '70s, this fantasy film inspired a sequel and two remakes! Eisenmann and Richards play a pair of orphans who wind up at Shaw's boarding school and, before long, begin to display various powers that indicate that they are not average youngsters. Eisenmann came make objects move without touching them and Richards is a telepath and can predict events before happen (as well as communicate with animals.) She can also undo locks making her, for some reason, a tad more gifted than her brother. When she saves Pleasance from an imminent accident, he realizes that his wealthy and exacting employer Milland would be most grateful to have the kids in his possession so that he can continue to make money via their gifts. Posing as their long-lost uncle, he brings them to Milland's well-appointed mansion, but, before long, the children realize that they are to be exploited and they run away, destined for the area shown on a map that Richards has hidden in her ever-present "star case," hence the title of the film. The young stars of the film give so-so performances, with Eisenmann perhaps doing a bit better, though they are thankfully free of the attitude and sarcasm that would be present in a modern day film. The duo reunited in the sequel and also worked together as brother and sister in the hysterically-titled "Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell." (Both have cameos in the forthcoming remake as well.) To a generation of young filmgoers, these two were an idealized rendition of brother & sister siblings. Milland gives the type of performance for which he was then being typecast, that of a wealthy, controlling and demanding old coot. Pleasance plays it all very straight and, as a result, his role lacks certain degrees of texture, though, again, it is welcome to see the villains of the piece provide a straightforward threat versus the hammy and over the top scenery-chewing that is the staple of today's kiddie flicks. Top-billed Albert doesn't clock in until nearly halftime, but adds a lot to the film. He plays a crusty, embittered camper whose heart is eventually warmed by the irrepressible pair of runaways. Pyle appears at the end as, quite possibly, the least expected representation of an alien imaginable! A product of its time, it is, like so many movies, riddled with contrivance and illogic, but it's also a very pleasant and endearing sort of movie. Certain things become a little trying, such as Richards repeated flashbacks, Eisenmann's harmonica playing and the extended chase sequences. However, this is made up for by the creative use of the children's powers and by the general feel of goodwill inherent in the film. The special effects range from excellent to barely adequate, but this is much preferred over the delirious and instantly unreal CGI work that proliferates now. It probably depends on the attention span of the child as to whether this would still be deemed entertaining today, though the use of puppets and animals (including a cat named Winky) in the film may aid in that endeavor. The sequel, released three years later, featured Bette Davis and Christopher Lee as the bad guys.

    This is an excellent movie, but I've often thought it was a derivative work of "The People" series by Zenna Henderson. If you like this movie or the book, you will likely enjoy Henderson's stories. Her stories involve the experiences of a variety of psychically endowed survivors from a planetary disaster who find themselves 'castaways' on Earth (sound familiar?). Most are unfamiliar with their PSI powers and are often taken for witches or demons and run out of town or worse. Many are children or young adults. Gradually, as the series matures, enclaves of those who know the whole story group together in backwoods hill country or other places where their powers are not visible. They enlist helpful earth people (like doctors) to find others of their kind and bring them 'home'. Edie Albert alludes to doing this in the movie. The bulk of Henderson's stories were written from 1952-1980 and brought together in a compilation called "Ingathering" in 1995. All of the stories are extremely well written although they are not always 'happy' during the story, they always end happy and and make you wish that was the way that people really were. Regardless of whether or not the script writer or book author was influenced by Henderson's work, the movie (and Henderson's stories) are an excellent introductions to the genre of Science Fiction for children and adults alike (the movie for kids, the stories for adults).

    Officially, or unofficially, this is my 1,000th review. I chose Escape to Witch Mountain because it was the very first movie I'd ever seen. And I will never forget that experience for the remainder of my days. Picture it: Rochester, New York, probably 1978 or 1979ish, when I was either 4-5 years old. My parents worked for the town's bread and butter: Kodak. They had a "Family Day" at the plant; more specifically, in the company's gym  a rather large basketball court. There were activities abound, but the highlight, to me, at least, was the giant screen that showed: Escape to Witch Mountain. I was captivated, enthralled. Even if I wasn't the exact age of the boy, Tony (Ike Eisenmann) in the story, in my mind, I was him. It was a story of two orphaned and "special" children  a brother and a sister and their eventual journey from foster care to a filthy-rich household. (Even though I was never orphaned, I did relate to them more than just being around the boy's age in the movie. I, too, only have one sibling, a sister, whom I was very close to, like in the movie.) After exploring all the neat and super-expensive stuff given to them by their new guardians in their spacious living quarters, they quickly learn that nothing's for free. These men, their money and dogs, want more out of the two children, who have special powers, than just a family. (I wouldn't know back then, their "powers" were telekinesis, but basically, it was that plus a few more physic powers.) Eventually, they're hunted down, on the run and with the help of a grumpy old man, they head towards all they know, at least in broken memories: Witch Mountain. To my recollection, this is only the second time I've ever seen this movie, roughly 34-35 years later and yet, I remember this movie (and initial viewing) like I'd seen this yesterday. I remember everything: the score, the scenes, the adventure, the comedy, the heart and most definitely, the message. I believe this, as my very first movie experience, really helped mold me to what I am today. I believe it always made me skeptical of people who offer "free" stuff for "nothing." I think it created a fantasy within myself of being free as an orphan, with only your sibling in tow, and adventures it can lead to. And I trust it partially gave me the heart that these kids had. Now, I will say, the movie's not perfect, aside from the laughable and obvious special effects  you can see the wires multiples of time, as well as the driving green screens. But, dang, it's well near perfection. The score, the cinematography, the acting, the character depth, the originality and adventure of storytelling still, incredibly, holds up today. Despite this being released in 1975, four(ish) years prior to me seeing it, it's an extremely fun quest of two wonderful children and the great guy who didn't know he had a heart. Oh and there's a winking cat to aid in their journey. Who couldn't love that? I was actually thinking, for the first time in my 1,000(+) reviewing history of giving this a pass because it was the movie that began my love of cinema. But, as I watched it, this time as an adult and three decades later, I do believe it is an excellent film regardless of being marketed as a G-Rated family movie. I truly marveled in the storytelling and laughed a lot  never unintentionally. Now, I have seen the sort-of "remake," but never seen the sequel, Return from Witch Mountain. Perhaps I will venture into the direct sequel and reboot again now that I revisited the original. In any case, this is a great movie, even to this day. If you haven't seen it, see what I saw. As a child or as an adult. And here's to another 1,000 reviews. Oh, vey!

    Escape to Witch Mountain (1975) *** (out of 4) Brother and sister psychics (Kim Richards, Ike Eisenmann) are pretty much kidnapped by an old man (Ray Milland) and his assistant (Donald Pleasence) who plan on using their special talents. The kids eventually run away and with the help of an elderly man (Eddie Albert) they try to find out who they really are as well as escape those chasing them. This Disney film has became a rather big cult item over the past couple decades and it's easy to see why as the story is fun enough to where kids can enjoy it and adults will also have a good time since none of the story is dumbed down and even better is the fact that we get some veterans who add to the fun. There's certainly nothing ground-breaking or terrific here but it's pleasant enough of an entertaining. The main highlight of the film are the terrific special effects, which rang from various items floating through the air as well as a couple nice tricks with cars flying. These special effects look very good for the time they were made but I was really impressed in how good they look even by today's standards. The cast are all very good in their parts with Richards and Eisenmann really standing out as the kids. A lot of the movie deals with these kid's intelligence so it really helps that you can believe these actors are smart enough and this helps make the film more plausible. The supporting players are all terrific as well with Milland doing his typical bad guy performance as he screams, shouts and carries on like only he can. Pleasence is a lot of fun but Albert really steals the show as the elderly man who has a few dark secrets of his own. Albert works very well with the two kids and the three together really make this a fun adventure. The film really doesn't have any menace and that's certainly not a bad thing because it's rather refreshing seeing something so simple and pure yet at the same time smart and not just trying to be laughs out of dumbness.

    I wouldn't call this a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but it's above average for a kid's movie. Personally I prefer The Rock's version to this one, but their is still fun to be had here. Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards are pretty good as the kids They are wooden sometimes, but they had a certain appeal about them that I liked. As dated as some of them looked, I will admit some of the special effects were still really neat to see. My favorite scene has to be when Jason O'Day's character|Eddie Albert| finds the cat and the two kids in his trailer. My main complaint about this movie, has to be that I didn't find Ray Milland or Donald Pleseance to be menacing enough, and I admire both of these actors. Performances. Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards aren't anything outstanding, but they had a certain memorable charm about them. Eddie Albert is wonderful as O'day. Grunpy, but with a hearty of gold. Ray Milland is decent, but not as menacing as he should have been, same goes for Donald Pleseance. Bottom line. I don't think I'd ever watch it again, but it was an alright time-waster.

Regardless of whether or not the script writer or book author was influenced by Henderson's work, the movie (and Henderson's stories) are an excellent introductions to the genre of Science Fiction for children and adults alike (the movie for kids, the stories for adults).
