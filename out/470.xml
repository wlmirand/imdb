    If I were to list my all time favorite Westerns, Tombstone would definitely be at the top. I even love the director's cut that was release not to long ago that explained some missing pieces. Some critics have compared Tombstone with Wyatt Earp, which came out a year later. I believe this is an unfair comparison since Tombstone dealt with the events that happened in Tombstone, AZ and Wyatt Earp spanned more of Wyatt Earp's life before Tombstone, his life in Tombstone, and a little of his life after Tombstone. I love this movie because everything was made to look authentic. The facial hair was real, which is awesome... no fake hair on these guys faces. There is a scene with a thunderstorm that roles in and... it's real. One of my favorite scenes is when Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton), and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) first meet Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang), and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). In this scene Wyatt is dealing a faro game and he has just signed an autograph for a patron. Curly Bill grabs the autograph out of the man's hand and reads it. Ike jumps in and says that "law don't go round here." Wyatt informs him that he is retired. Johnny Ringo joins the conversation by looking at Doc Holliday and saying that he must be Doc Holliday. An exchange between the two ensues that could have gone wrong when Ringo draws his gun and begins spinning it. However, Doc uses a cup to diffuse the situation by spinning it in the same manner Ringo did. Another favorite scene is when Ike and Frank Stilwell (Thomas Arana) follow Wyatt and the rest of his family to Tucson to take Morgan's body to California. Ike and Frank are tasked to kill Wyatt and Virgil. Before they can complete their task Wyatt kills Frank. Wyatt walks up to a cowering Ike and takes his spur and cuts him at the corner of the mouth. Wyatt informs Ike that he is now a U.S. Marshall and that he is going to hunt down every Cowboy and kill them. The scene at the OK Corral is amazing. It is as close to what really happened as the film could get it without going back to October 26, 1881. I won't describe it because I wouldn't be able to do it justice and I want you to watch the movie if you haven't or again if you have. There are other scenes I liked as well. The movie itself is very good. This would have to be my absolute favorite Western movie of all time. I like this movie so much that I have remembered many of the various lines. Many of the lines Val Kilmer spoke as Doc Holliday are great, including, "I'm your Huckleberry". I give this 10 stars out of 10. I love this movie. I also recently read an article that told a story in which the original director was let go from this movie. A new director was hired and the production company whittled the script down significantly. Kurt Russell is also responsible for rallying the other actors and crew to finish the movie, said the same article.

    I don't watch movies to learn great things about history, I watch movies to be entertained. For me, the desire to watch a movie more than once is telling, and Tombstone is one of those movies that remains highly entertaining with repetitive viewings. The cast is perfect, Kurt Russell is a perfect Wyatt Earp, and Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holiday is nothing sort of amazing. How Kilmer was denied the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award is beyond my understanding. In my opinion, the very best American westerns include: (number 1) The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Unforgiven (along with most of Eastwood's other westerns) and now Tombstone should be added to that short list. If you watch movies to be entertained, as I do, even if you are not a Western fan, Tombstone is an entertaining classic. Watch it and you'll agree.

    Tombstone is a action packed western starring half of the Hollywood's character actors and action stars in film that slightly resembles a biopic of the legendary lawman Wyatt Earp. This film is a fun ride with good performances, great action, plenty of melodrama and mustaches. As a story, Tombstone is pretty uneven, the pacing is off after first hour, the editing leaves much to be desired, the villains are boring and one note, the plot starts and stops and starts all over again and the film is way too long. This film is one huge mess but thanks to the excellent performances by the cast, good action set pieces, great cinematography and the overpowering amount mustaches, the problems seem less important. There are three standout performances in this film - Kurt Russel, Sam Elliot and Val Kilmer. They pretty much carried the film on their own despite having some of the best supporting cast for film you can ever want. It's loaded with great character actors and Bill Zane to keep this very entertaining to watch. Also I really liked the how they handled the character of Doc Holliday. He was such a fascinating character and the performance by Val Kilmer was just right. They just should have made a film about him. Tombstone is an entertaining film and will not bore you if you like the actors enough and have certain appreciation of the classic, violent western. As a narrative it's pretty weak and rather forgettable, but the performances pretty much carry this film, at least for me.

    I personally feel it's difficult to break away from this Hollywood Pictures production, directed by George Cosmatos, with all the excitement found therein, as well as being filmed in a just-right location: namely the Old Tucson movie site. Kurt Russell played a mean-but-just Wyatt Earp. Sam Elliott was excellent as his brother Virgil. Bill Paxton portrayed Morgan Earp well. And you had no sympathy for the following people: Curly Bill Brocius (acted to a tee by Powers Boothe), Johnny Ringo (the mean man portrayed by Michael Biehn) and Ike Clanton (a fine turn by Stephen Lang.) John "Doc" Holiday was exactly like Val Kilmer, I'd say. Charlton Heston, though his role was rather small and his appearance in the movie was rather brief, did a great feat as Henry Hooker. Billy Zane, who was mean in "Titanic" showed that he could adapt to any role, playing the sissified stage actor he was. (He was definitely disgusting in places!) Robert Mitchum had a deep and clear voice, and he the narrator was also very articulate. And who wouldn't have fallen in love with Dana Delaney, the beautiful, charming lady who played the actress Josephine Marcus? She was virtually realistic as the lovely lady so good for Wyatt. And too, the experienced actor Harry Carey, Jr. was good in his brief role as the lawman he was. The gunfights were exciting, and not only the gunfight at the OK Corral. The only thing I didn't like about it were the bloody scenes. The dry, Old West was fitting, since the setting of the story was in Arizona. Again, it is one of the best western movies I've ever seen in all my years. Great!

    Tombstone is easily one of the greatest Western films of all time and an unforgettable classic that is filled with great direction,wonderful cast,fantastic Action,well-written screenplay and an amazing score and is not only one of my favorite Westerns of all time but one of my favorite films of all time. Set in Tombstone,Arizona in 1881,Tombstone tells the story of Wyatt Earp(Kurt Russell),a lawman who recently retired who along with his two brothers Virgil Earp(Sam Elliot)and Morgan Earp(Bill Paxton)and their wives decide to start a new life in Tombstone. But Wyatt's plans to settle down and retire are ruined when Wyatt and his brothers have to deal with an outlaw gang called The Cowboys who want the Earps blood. Now with the help of their friend Doc Holliday(Val Kilmer),the Earps and Doc look to destroy The Cowboys at all costs. In 1993 and 1994 there were two Western films made about Western legend Wyatt Earp George P. Cosmatos' Tombstone in 1993 and Lawrence Kadsen's Wyatt Earp which came out a year later. Where as Tombstone was an intense Action film about the events that took place before and after the Gunfight At The O.K Corral,Wyatt Earp was an epic biopic about the man Wyatt Earp and while Wyatt Earp is a good film in it's own right Tombstone is just a better and fully realized film. Tombstone is just an excellent film from beginning to end and is one of those films when you turn on Tombstone you just never turn it off and you are glued to the screen. There have been many films about Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday and The Gunfight At The O.K Corral but Tombstone is a film that stands out and is in a league of it's own because while Tombstone is based on real characters and historical events the movie is a thrill ride that has memorable characters and tension like a tightrope and never lets the viewer go until the end. What I also love about Tombstone and the Western genre in general is that TS brings into the world of the Old West and shows viewers how the West really was where Lawman enforced the laws and Outlaws broke them and blood was spilled into the dust and dirt. The Western atmosphere is accurate and very realistic and comes off the screen. The portrayals of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday are great and is some of the best depictions of Wyatt and Doc ever put on the screen. In Tombstone Wyatt Earp is depicted as some one who cares about his family and friends and doesn't want to get involved or participate with the violence and uncontrolled chaos that is happening in Tombstone but at the same time Wyatt is tough,heroic and takes crap from no one whether it's The Cowboys or strangers on the street. In Tombstone Doc Holliday is a character who gambles and uses his guns as well as smarts and charisma to get out situations and when he's in a conversation. Doc is a character you will love as soon as he comes on screen. I also loved the friendship between Wyatt and Doc because it feels real and truthful and when you watch the film you can tell that Wyatt and Doc really care about one another and that their friendship is honest. The film's screenplay by Kevin Jarre is great and well-written,with Jarre's script giving the main characters fantastic dialog and great,memorable scenes that will stay with the viewer after the film is over. The Action scenes in Tombstone are amazing and intense with wonderful Western gunfights and is done with great build up wonderful tension and white hot suspense especially The Gunfight At The O.K Correl scene. The build up to The Gunfight At The O.K Correl is unforgettable and when the classic Gunfight happens it explodes like a bomb and is done in a rapid fire quickness and you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. The Gunfight At The O.K Correl in this film is one of the best Action movie gunfights in film history and will be remembered forever. The ending of the film is wonderful and will leave you sad and happy and is a great cap off to Tombstone. The whole cast is wonderful. Kurt Russell is excellent and at his best as Wyatt Earp,with Russell bringing grit,toughness and depth to the role and is truly memorable. Val Kilmer gives a brilliant,unforgettable Oscar worthy iconic scene stealing performance as Doc Holliday,with Kilmer bringing coolness,charisma,great dialog and humor to the role. Kilmer's performance is masterful and will stick with you. Sam Elliot(Virgil Earp) and Bill Paxton(Morgan Earp)give great performances as Wyatt's brothers. Powers Booth(Curly Bill Brocius),Michael Biehn(Johnny Ringo)and Stephen Lang(Ike Clanton)give fantastic performances as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Dana Delany is great and beautiful as Josephine Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Jon Tenney is wonderful as Behan,a corrupt County Sheriff. Also,lookout for appearances from Charlton Heston(Henry Rooker),Michael Rooker(Sherman McMasters),Harry Carey Jr.(Marshel Fred White),Thomas Haden Church(Billy Clanton),Billy Bob Thorton(Johnny Tyler),Robert Burke(Frank McLaury),Joanna Pucula(Kate),Billy Zane(Mr. Fabian),Jason Priestly(Billy Breckinridge),Dana Wheeler-Nicholson(Mattie Earp),Terry O'Quinn(Mayor John Clum),John Corbett(Barnes),Pedro Armendariz Jr.(Priest)and Sly's younger brother Frank Stallone(Ed Bailey). The direction by George P. Cosmatos is excellent,with Cosmatos bringing an big,epic scope to the film and making the West look beautiful and glorious and wonderful shots of the sunlight and sky while Cosmatos also does a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Cosmatos. The score by Bruce Broughton is brilliant,epic,tragic and intense and matches the tone of the film and each scene. Great powerful score by Broughton. In final word,if you love Western films,Action films or films in general I highly suggest you see Tombstone,one of the best Westerns films of all time and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I am not a connoisseur of westerns but whenever this is on TV, I end up watching it again and again. It is the very best western I've ever seen. Val Kilmer is the real star of the film. He was not nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar. Neither was the movie nominated. Martin Landau was just OK in Ed Wood. Val Kilmer's every line in the movie is memorable and quotable." I'm your huckleberry." "Why Johnny Ringo, you look like someone just walked over your grave." " My hypocrisy knows no bound and so much more." His death scene brings tears to my eyes and is real acting. The Oscars no longer care about talent only marketing. I no longer pay attention to them anymore.

    Tombstone tells a tale that's been told over and over again, but manages to make it interesting. The good. Well done decor and costumes. Nice photography. Plenty of shootout. Interesting story. The actors. Kurt Russell did a credible job as Wyatt Earp, but it's probably the extent of his capabilities as you can see his limitations from time to time. Val Kilmer is absolutely excellent as his cultured, but edgy friend, Doc Holliday. Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton both give nice performances as his brothers. The bad. The river scene is of poor quality, Russell overdoing it by a fair margin, probably under the direction of the director. There are a few scenes where he's not at his best, but that one is the worst. The ugly. Nothing. The result. Excellent western action entertainment. Recommended to those who like the genre and the fans of Russell or Kilmer.

    I saw this one back-to-back with Kevin Costner's 'Wyatt Earp'(1994) movie and wow, what a difference in similarities. I will compare both films characters and interpretations , if applicable, and come to a conclusion at the end. Kurt Russell's Wyatt was not bad. I enjoyed it. This Earp story was more about like the title, about just that. Costner's was more how Wyatt Earp became the famous Earp from the beginning. So it's a tie as who did a better Wyatt Earp. Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday was a surprise. I felt he did a great job just as Dennis Quaid did with his. Very difficult on this also. I give it a tie also. Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp was right on casting. As this great actor personifies the ideal cowboy to me. Michael Madsen's interpretation was not bad but Elliott just nailed it. Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, also a great casting. I prefer Paxton's over Linden Ashby's. Even though Paxton's death scene was more Hollywood-ish and Ashby's more real and the Earp woman were more real in Costner's version. Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocius was a treat. Again Boothe wins over Lewis Smith's one. Boothe was sneaky, sinister and just slimy evil. Great casting even though he looked more ethnic per say. When I 1st saw him I really thought he was a Mexican bandido or something. lol Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo wins big time. Not only did Biehn do a phenomenal great job, the Ringo character was much more displayed and played a vital role here than Costner's one! The final showdown of Biehns Ringo with Kilmer's Holliday is classic! Charlton Heston as Henry Hooker was more like a glorified cameo and that's all. Still nice to see the late great Heston in a modern western regardless. Jason Priestley as Billy Breckinridge I felt was a OK but not enough screen time for this young actor so I feel he was wasted per say. Both these characters were not portrayed in the Costner version. Jon Tenney as Sheriff Johnny Behan was I believe a tie with Mark Harmon's. Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton was just great. A tie with Jeff Fahey's, who was also great. Thomas Haden Church as Billy Clanton was much better than Costner's version. Dana Delany as Josephine Marcus. was not bad but I gotta give it to Joanna Going's version. Both very beautiful actresses and they needed someone like that to interpret the Josephine role to make it believable that Wyatt would be mesmerized by this woman. Paula Malcomson as Allie Earp loses to the great Catherine O'Hara's version. Even the beautiful Dana Wheeler-Nicholson's Mattie Blaylock loses to Mare Winningham's version. Joanna Pacula's take on Big Nose Kate was way more believable than Isabella Rossellini's. But then again Isabella wasn't given much screen time and some of her scenes were cut, so who knows, had Isabella had more to do she could have given Pacula a run for her money. Michael Rooker as Sherman McMasters was not bad but short. Still it was way better than Todd Allen's in Costner's version. Billy Bob Thornton as Johnny Tyler was a nice treat. Paul Ben-Victor as Florentino was amusing. John Philbin as Tom McLaury was a nice bit. His was better than Adam Baldwin's one even though Baldwin's was more menacing as he stands 6'4" but Baldwin didn't have much to do in his version and Philbin has a nice bit confrontation scene with Russell's Wyatt. Robert John Burke as Frank McLaury was so-so. I prefer Rex Linn's one. Billy Zane as Mr. Fabian was nice bit. perfect casting for Zane. Even Boothe's Curly says, "this is the handsomest man I have ever seen"! lol Buck Taylor as Turkey Creek Jack Johnson was better than Costner's version. Terry O'Quinn as Mayor John Clum was not bad at all. I wonder how he would have done in the Behan role instead. Frank Stallone as Ed Bailey had a nice cameo bit. And Robert Mitchum as the Narrator was not inspired but nice to hear the recognizable Mitchum tone in there. In the end, both films are good but as far as interpretations goes I gotta give it to Tombstone. But as storyline goes , Costner's versions wins there.

    I hate this movie. The makers of this dreck should be forced, like Alex in a Clockwork Orange, to watch "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" over and over and over again until they understand what a western should feel like. This is a Hollywood western, overacted, clich&eacute;, horse manure, the 90s equivalent of a Roy Rogers, all flair, with no depth or reality. Every line is this movie sounds like a catch phrase. Every shot in this movie looks like it belongs in a commercial or a music video. I suppose if you just want to be entertained, with brain left at home, then this crap might be for you. As for me, I'll take a dirty, gritty, Sergio Leone Clint Eastwood western any day.

    Tombstone is a "good looking movie"". That is one of the few reasons you should watch it. It is about 1% historically accurate. The story is absurd. The script is weak. The acting is poor. Val Kilmer is hysterically funny with his ridiculous "camped up" version of Doc Holliday. He should have won the razz in 1993 (he was robbed). Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp) tries too hard to be cool, and wearing his whiter than white shirts is highly amusing. I was not there, but I can assure you...the West was not like this...Tombstone was not a "cosmopolitan American Town". The story of Wyatt Earp, Tombstone, The O.K. corral, Etc. was nothing like this. Maybe this was made for young teenagers...Or maybe this is just a bad movie.

Another favorite scene is when Ike and Frank Stilwell (Thomas Arana) follow Wyatt and the rest of his family to Tucson to take Morgan's body to California. Ike and Frank are tasked to kill Wyatt and Virgil. Before they can complete their task Wyatt kills Frank. Wyatt walks up to a cowering Ike and takes his spur and cuts him at the corner of the mouth.

John "Doc" Holiday was exactly like Val Kilmer, I'd say. Charlton Heston, though his role was rather small and his appearance in the movie was rather brief, did a great feat as Henry Hooker. Billy Zane, who was mean in "Titanic" showed that he could adapt to any role, playing the sissified stage actor he was. (He was definitely disgusting in places!) Robert Mitchum had a deep and clear voice, and he the narrator was also very articulate. And who wouldn't have fallen in love with Dana Delaney, the beautiful, charming lady who played the actress Josephine Marcus? She was virtually realistic as the lovely lady so good for Wyatt. And too, the experienced actor Harry Carey, Jr. was good in his brief role as the lawman he was. The gunfights were exciting, and not only the gunfight at the OK Corral. The only thing I didn't like about it were the bloody scenes. The dry, Old West was fitting, since the setting of the story was in Arizona. Again, it is one of the best western movies I've ever seen in all my years. Great!

    Tombstone is easily one of the greatest Western films of all time and an unforgettable classic that is filled with great direction,wonderful cast,fantastic Action,well-written screenplay and an amazing score and is not only one of my favorite Westerns of all time but one of my favorite films of all time. Set in Tombstone,Arizona in 1881,Tombstone tells the story of Wyatt Earp(Kurt Russell),a lawman who recently retired who along with his two brothers Virgil Earp(Sam Elliot)and Morgan Earp(Bill Paxton)and their wives decide to start a new life in Tombstone. But Wyatt's plans to settle down and retire are ruined when Wyatt and his brothers have to deal with an outlaw gang called The Cowboys who want the Earps blood. Now with the help of their friend Doc Holliday(Val Kilmer),the Earps and Doc look to destroy The Cowboys at all costs. In 1993 and 1994 there were two Western films made about Western legend Wyatt Earp George P. Cosmatos' Tombstone in 1993 and Lawrence Kadsen's Wyatt Earp which came out a year later. Where as Tombstone was an intense Action film about the events that took place before and after the Gunfight At The O.K Corral,Wyatt Earp was an epic biopic about the man Wyatt Earp and while Wyatt Earp is a good film in it's own right Tombstone is just a better and fully realized film. Tombstone is just an excellent film from beginning to end and is one of those films when you turn on Tombstone you just never turn it off and you are glued to the screen. There have been many films about Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday and The Gunfight At The O.K Corral but Tombstone is a film that stands out and is in a league of it's own because while Tombstone is based on real characters and historical events the movie is a thrill ride that has memorable characters and tension like a tightrope and never lets the viewer go until the end. What I also love about Tombstone and the Western genre in general is that TS brings into the world of the Old West and shows viewers how the West really was where Lawman enforced the laws and Outlaws broke them and blood was spilled into the dust and dirt. The Western atmosphere is accurate and very realistic and comes off the screen. The portrayals of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday are great and is some of the best depictions of Wyatt and Doc ever put on the screen. In Tombstone Wyatt Earp is depicted as some one who cares about his family and friends and doesn't want to get involved or participate with the violence and uncontrolled chaos that is happening in Tombstone but at the same time Wyatt is tough,heroic and takes crap from no one whether it's The Cowboys or strangers on the street. In Tombstone Doc Holliday is a character who gambles and uses his guns as well as smarts and charisma to get out situations and when he's in a conversation. Doc is a character you will love as soon as he comes on screen. I also loved the friendship between Wyatt and Doc because it feels real and truthful and when you watch the film you can tell that Wyatt and Doc really care about one another and that their friendship is honest. The film's screenplay by Kevin Jarre is great and well-written,with Jarre's script giving the main characters fantastic dialog and great,memorable scenes that will stay with the viewer after the film is over. The Action scenes in Tombstone are amazing and intense with wonderful Western gunfights and is done with great build up wonderful tension and white hot suspense especially The Gunfight At The O.K Correl scene. The build up to The Gunfight At The O.K Correl is unforgettable and when the classic Gunfight happens it explodes like a bomb and is done in a rapid fire quickness and you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. The Gunfight At The O.K Correl in this film is one of the best Action movie gunfights in film history and will be remembered forever. The ending of the film is wonderful and will leave you sad and happy and is a great cap off to Tombstone. The whole cast is wonderful. Kurt Russell is excellent and at his best as Wyatt Earp,with Russell bringing grit,toughness and depth to the role and is truly memorable. Val Kilmer gives a brilliant,unforgettable Oscar worthy iconic scene stealing performance as Doc Holliday,with Kilmer bringing coolness,charisma,great dialog and humor to the role. Kilmer's performance is masterful and will stick with you. Sam Elliot(Virgil Earp) and Bill Paxton(Morgan Earp)give great performances as Wyatt's brothers. Powers Booth(Curly Bill Brocius),Michael Biehn(Johnny Ringo)and Stephen Lang(Ike Clanton)give fantastic performances as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Dana Delany is great and beautiful as Josephine Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Jon Tenney is wonderful as Behan,a corrupt County Sheriff. Also,lookout for appearances from Charlton Heston(Henry Rooker),Michael Rooker(Sherman McMasters),Harry Carey Jr.(Marshel Fred White),Thomas Haden Church(Billy Clanton),Billy Bob Thorton(Johnny Tyler),Robert Burke(Frank McLaury),Joanna Pucula(Kate),Billy Zane(Mr. Fabian),Jason Priestly(Billy Breckinridge),Dana Wheeler-Nicholson(Mattie Earp),Terry O'Quinn(Mayor John Clum),John Corbett(Barnes),Pedro Armendariz Jr.(Priest)and Sly's younger brother Frank Stallone(Ed Bailey). The direction by George P. Cosmatos is excellent,with Cosmatos bringing an big,epic scope to the film and making the West look beautiful and glorious and wonderful shots of the sunlight and sky while Cosmatos also does a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Cosmatos. The score by Bruce Broughton is brilliant,epic,tragic and intense and matches the tone of the film and each scene. Great powerful score by Broughton. In final word,if you love Western films,Action films or films in general I highly suggest you see Tombstone,one of the best Westerns films of all time and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I am not a connoisseur of westerns but whenever this is on TV, I end up watching it again and again. It is the very best western I've ever seen. Val Kilmer is the real star of the film. He was not nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar. Neither was the movie nominated. Martin Landau was just OK in Ed Wood. Val Kilmer's every line in the movie is memorable and quotable." I'm your huckleberry." "Why Johnny Ringo, you look like someone just walked over your grave." " My hypocrisy knows no bound and so much more." His death scene brings tears to my eyes and is real acting. The Oscars no longer care about talent only marketing. I no longer pay attention to them anymore.

    Tombstone tells a tale that's been told over and over again, but manages to make it interesting. The good. Well done decor and costumes. Nice photography. Plenty of shootout. Interesting story. The actors. Kurt Russell did a credible job as Wyatt Earp, but it's probably the extent of his capabilities as you can see his limitations from time to time. Val Kilmer is absolutely excellent as his cultured, but edgy friend, Doc Holliday. Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton both give nice performances as his brothers. The bad. The river scene is of poor quality, Russell overdoing it by a fair margin, probably under the direction of the director. There are a few scenes where he's not at his best, but that one is the worst. The ugly. Nothing. The result. Excellent western action entertainment. Recommended to those who like the genre and the fans of Russell or Kilmer.

    I saw this one back-to-back with Kevin Costner's 'Wyatt Earp'(1994) movie and wow, what a difference in similarities. I will compare both films characters and interpretations , if applicable, and come to a conclusion at the end. Kurt Russell's Wyatt was not bad. I enjoyed it. This Earp story was more about like the title, about just that. Costner's was more how Wyatt Earp became the famous Earp from the beginning. So it's a tie as who did a better Wyatt Earp. Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday was a surprise. I felt he did a great job just as Dennis Quaid did with his. Very difficult on this also. I give it a tie also. Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp was right on casting. As this great actor personifies the ideal cowboy to me. Michael Madsen's interpretation was not bad but Elliott just nailed it. Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, also a great casting. I prefer Paxton's over Linden Ashby's. Even though Paxton's death scene was more Hollywood-ish and Ashby's more real and the Earp woman were more real in Costner's version. Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocius was a treat. Again Boothe wins over Lewis Smith's one. Boothe was sneaky, sinister and just slimy evil. Great casting even though he looked more ethnic per say. When I 1st saw him I really thought he was a Mexican bandido or something. lol Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo wins big time. Not only did Biehn do a phenomenal great job, the Ringo character was much more displayed and played a vital role here than Costner's one! The final showdown of Biehns Ringo with Kilmer's Holliday is classic! Charlton Heston as Henry Hooker was more like a glorified cameo and that's all. Still nice to see the late great Heston in a modern western regardless. Jason Priestley as Billy Breckinridge I felt was a OK but not enough screen time for this young actor so I feel he was wasted per say. Both these characters were not portrayed in the Costner version. Jon Tenney as Sheriff Johnny Behan was I believe a tie with Mark Harmon's. Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton was just great. A tie with Jeff Fahey's, who was also great. Thomas Haden Church as Billy Clanton was much better than Costner's version. Dana Delany as Josephine Marcus. was not bad but I gotta give it to Joanna Going's version. Both very beautiful actresses and they needed someone like that to interpret the Josephine role to make it believable that Wyatt would be mesmerized by this woman. Paula Malcomson as Allie Earp loses to the great Catherine O'Hara's version. Even the beautiful Dana Wheeler-Nicholson's Mattie Blaylock loses to Mare Winningham's version. Joanna Pacula's take on Big Nose Kate was way more believable than Isabella Rossellini's. But then again Isabella wasn't given much screen time and some of her scenes were cut, so who knows, had Isabella had more to do she could have given Pacula a run for her money. Michael Rooker as Sherman McMasters was not bad but short. Still it was way better than Todd Allen's in Costner's version. Billy Bob Thornton as Johnny Tyler was a nice treat. Paul Ben-Victor as Florentino was amusing. John Philbin as Tom McLaury was a nice bit. His was better than Adam Baldwin's one even though Baldwin's was more menacing as he stands 6'4" but Baldwin didn't have much to do in his version and Philbin has a nice bit confrontation scene with Russell's Wyatt. Robert John Burke as Frank McLaury was so-so. I prefer Rex Linn's one. Billy Zane as Mr. Fabian was nice bit. perfect casting for Zane. Even Boothe's Curly says, "this is the handsomest man I have ever seen"! lol Buck Taylor as Turkey Creek Jack Johnson was better than Costner's version. Terry O'Quinn as Mayor John Clum was not bad at all. I wonder how he would have done in the Behan role instead. Frank Stallone as Ed Bailey had a nice cameo bit. And Robert Mitchum as the Narrator was not inspired but nice to hear the recognizable Mitchum tone in there. In the end, both films are good but as far as interpretations goes I gotta give it to Tombstone. But as storyline goes , Costner's versions wins there.

    I hate this movie. The makers of this dreck should be forced, like Alex in a Clockwork Orange, to watch "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" over and over and over again until they understand what a western should feel like. This is a Hollywood western, overacted, clich&eacute;, horse manure, the 90s equivalent of a Roy Rogers, all flair, with no depth or reality. Every line is this movie sounds like a catch phrase. Every shot in this movie looks like it belongs in a commercial or a music video. I suppose if you just want to be entertained, with brain left at home, then this crap might be for you. As for me, I'll take a dirty, gritty, Sergio Leone Clint Eastwood western any day.

    Tombstone is a "good looking movie"". That is one of the few reasons you should watch it. It is about 1% historically accurate. The story is absurd. The script is weak. The acting is poor. Val Kilmer is hysterically funny with his ridiculous "camped up" version of Doc Holliday. He should have won the razz in 1993 (he was robbed). Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp) tries too hard to be cool, and wearing his whiter than white shirts is highly amusing. I was not there, but I can assure you...the West was not like this...Tombstone was not a "cosmopolitan American Town". The story of Wyatt Earp, Tombstone, The O.K. corral, Etc. was nothing like this. Maybe this was made for young teenagers...Or maybe this is just a bad movie.

    If I were to list my all time favorite Westerns, Tombstone would definitely be at the top. I even love the director's cut that was release not to long ago that explained some missing pieces. Some critics have compared Tombstone with Wyatt Earp, which came out a year later. I believe this is an unfair comparison since Tombstone dealt with the events that happened in Tombstone, AZ and Wyatt Earp spanned more of Wyatt Earp's life before Tombstone, his life in Tombstone, and a little of his life after Tombstone. I love this movie because everything was made to look authentic. The facial hair was real, which is awesome... no fake hair on these guys faces. There is a scene with a thunderstorm that roles in and... it's real. One of my favorite scenes is when Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton), and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) first meet Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang), and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). In this scene Wyatt is dealing a faro game and he has just signed an autograph for a patron. Curly Bill grabs the autograph out of the man's hand and reads it. Ike jumps in and says that "law don't go round here." Wyatt informs him that he is retired. Johnny Ringo joins the conversation by looking at Doc Holliday and saying that he must be Doc Holliday. An exchange between the two ensues that could have gone wrong when Ringo draws his gun and begins spinning it. However, Doc uses a cup to diffuse the situation by spinning it in the same manner Ringo did. Another favorite scene is when Ike and Frank Stilwell (Thomas Arana) follow Wyatt and the rest of his family to Tucson to take Morgan's body to California. Ike and Frank are tasked to kill Wyatt and Virgil. Before they can complete their task Wyatt kills Frank. Wyatt walks up to a cowering Ike and takes his spur and cuts him at the corner of the mouth. Wyatt informs Ike that he is now a U.S. Marshall and that he is going to hunt down every Cowboy and kill them. The scene at the OK Corral is amazing. It is as close to what really happened as the film could get it without going back to October 26, 1881. I won't describe it because I wouldn't be able to do it justice and I want you to watch the movie if you haven't or again if you have. There are other scenes I liked as well. The movie itself is very good. This would have to be my absolute favorite Western movie of all time. I like this movie so much that I have remembered many of the various lines. Many of the lines Val Kilmer spoke as Doc Holliday are great, including, "I'm your Huckleberry". I give this 10 stars out of 10. I love this movie. I also recently read an article that told a story in which the original director was let go from this movie. A new director was hired and the production company whittled the script down significantly. Kurt Russell is also responsible for rallying the other actors and crew to finish the movie, said the same article.

    I don't watch movies to learn great things about history, I watch movies to be entertained. For me, the desire to watch a movie more than once is telling, and Tombstone is one of those movies that remains highly entertaining with repetitive viewings. The cast is perfect, Kurt Russell is a perfect Wyatt Earp, and Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holiday is nothing sort of amazing. How Kilmer was denied the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award is beyond my understanding. In my opinion, the very best American westerns include: (number 1) The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Unforgiven (along with most of Eastwood's other westerns) and now Tombstone should be added to that short list. If you watch movies to be entertained, as I do, even if you are not a Western fan, Tombstone is an entertaining classic. Watch it and you'll agree.

    Tombstone is a action packed western starring half of the Hollywood's character actors and action stars in film that slightly resembles a biopic of the legendary lawman Wyatt Earp. This film is a fun ride with good performances, great action, plenty of melodrama and mustaches. As a story, Tombstone is pretty uneven, the pacing is off after first hour, the editing leaves much to be desired, the villains are boring and one note, the plot starts and stops and starts all over again and the film is way too long. This film is one huge mess but thanks to the excellent performances by the cast, good action set pieces, great cinematography and the overpowering amount mustaches, the problems seem less important. There are three standout performances in this film - Kurt Russel, Sam Elliot and Val Kilmer. They pretty much carried the film on their own despite having some of the best supporting cast for film you can ever want. It's loaded with great character actors and Bill Zane to keep this very entertaining to watch. Also I really liked the how they handled the character of Doc Holliday. He was such a fascinating character and the performance by Val Kilmer was just right. They just should have made a film about him. Tombstone is an entertaining film and will not bore you if you like the actors enough and have certain appreciation of the classic, violent western. As a narrative it's pretty weak and rather forgettable, but the performances pretty much carry this film, at least for me.

    I personally feel it's difficult to break away from this Hollywood Pictures production, directed by George Cosmatos, with all the excitement found therein, as well as being filmed in a just-right location: namely the Old Tucson movie site. Kurt Russell played a mean-but-just Wyatt Earp. Sam Elliott was excellent as his brother Virgil. Bill Paxton portrayed Morgan Earp well. And you had no sympathy for the following people: Curly Bill Brocius (acted to a tee by Powers Boothe), Johnny Ringo (the mean man portrayed by Michael Biehn) and Ike Clanton (a fine turn by Stephen Lang.) John "Doc" Holiday was exactly like Val Kilmer, I'd say. Charlton Heston, though his role was rather small and his appearance in the movie was rather brief, did a great feat as Henry Hooker. Billy Zane, who was mean in "Titanic" showed that he could adapt to any role, playing the sissified stage actor he was. (He was definitely disgusting in places!) Robert Mitchum had a deep and clear voice, and he the narrator was also very articulate. And who wouldn't have fallen in love with Dana Delaney, the beautiful, charming lady who played the actress Josephine Marcus? She was virtually realistic as the lovely lady so good for Wyatt. And too, the experienced actor Harry Carey, Jr. was good in his brief role as the lawman he was. The gunfights were exciting, and not only the gunfight at the OK Corral. The only thing I didn't like about it were the bloody scenes. The dry, Old West was fitting, since the setting of the story was in Arizona. Again, it is one of the best western movies I've ever seen in all my years. Great!

Dana Delany is great and beautiful as Josephine Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Jon Tenney is wonderful as Behan,a corrupt County Sheriff. Also,lookout for appearances from Charlton Heston(Henry Rooker),Michael Rooker(Sherman McMasters),Harry Carey Jr.(Marshel Fred White),Thomas Haden Church(Billy Clanton),Billy Bob Thorton(Johnny Tyler),Robert Burke(Frank McLaury),Joanna Pucula(Kate),Billy Zane(Mr. Fabian),Jason Priestly(Billy Breckinridge),Dana Wheeler-Nicholson(Mattie Earp),Terry O'Quinn(Mayor John Clum),John Corbett(Barnes),Pedro Armendariz Jr.(Priest)and Sly's younger brother Frank Stallone(Ed Bailey). The direction by George P. Cosmatos is excellent,with Cosmatos bringing an big,epic scope to the film and making the West look beautiful and glorious and wonderful shots of the sunlight and sky while Cosmatos also does a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Cosmatos. The score by Bruce Broughton is brilliant,epic,tragic and intense and matches the tone of the film and each scene. Great powerful score by Broughton. In final word,if you love Western films,Action films or films in general I highly suggest you see Tombstone,one of the best Westerns films of all time and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

The river scene is of poor quality, Russell overdoing it by a fair margin, probably under the direction of the director. There are a few scenes where he's not at his best, but that one is the worst. The ugly. Nothing. The result. Excellent western action entertainment. Recommended to those who like the genre and the fans of Russell or Kilmer.

    I saw this one back-to-back with Kevin Costner's 'Wyatt Earp'(1994) movie and wow, what a difference in similarities. I will compare both films characters and interpretations , if applicable, and come to a conclusion at the end. Kurt Russell's Wyatt was not bad. I enjoyed it. This Earp story was more about like the title, about just that. Costner's was more how Wyatt Earp became the famous Earp from the beginning. So it's a tie as who did a better Wyatt Earp. Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday was a surprise. I felt he did a great job just as Dennis Quaid did with his. Very difficult on this also. I give it a tie also. Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp was right on casting. As this great actor personifies the ideal cowboy to me. Michael Madsen's interpretation was not bad but Elliott just nailed it. Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, also a great casting. I prefer Paxton's over Linden Ashby's. Even though Paxton's death scene was more Hollywood-ish and Ashby's more real and the Earp woman were more real in Costner's version. Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocius was a treat. Again Boothe wins over Lewis Smith's one. Boothe was sneaky, sinister and just slimy evil. Great casting even though he looked more ethnic per say. When I 1st saw him I really thought he was a Mexican bandido or something. lol Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo wins big time. Not only did Biehn do a phenomenal great job, the Ringo character was much more displayed and played a vital role here than Costner's one! The final showdown of Biehns Ringo with Kilmer's Holliday is classic! Charlton Heston as Henry Hooker was more like a glorified cameo and that's all. Still nice to see the late great Heston in a modern western regardless. Jason Priestley as Billy Breckinridge I felt was a OK but not enough screen time for this young actor so I feel he was wasted per say. Both these characters were not portrayed in the Costner version. Jon Tenney as Sheriff Johnny Behan was I believe a tie with Mark Harmon's. Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton was just great. A tie with Jeff Fahey's, who was also great. Thomas Haden Church as Billy Clanton was much better than Costner's version. Dana Delany as Josephine Marcus. was not bad but I gotta give it to Joanna Going's version. Both very beautiful actresses and they needed someone like that to interpret the Josephine role to make it believable that Wyatt would be mesmerized by this woman. Paula Malcomson as Allie Earp loses to the great Catherine O'Hara's version. Even the beautiful Dana Wheeler-Nicholson's Mattie Blaylock loses to Mare Winningham's version. Joanna Pacula's take on Big Nose Kate was way more believable than Isabella Rossellini's. But then again Isabella wasn't given much screen time and some of her scenes were cut, so who knows, had Isabella had more to do she could have given Pacula a run for her money. Michael Rooker as Sherman McMasters was not bad but short. Still it was way better than Todd Allen's in Costner's version. Billy Bob Thornton as Johnny Tyler was a nice treat. Paul Ben-Victor as Florentino was amusing. John Philbin as Tom McLaury was a nice bit. His was better than Adam Baldwin's one even though Baldwin's was more menacing as he stands 6'4" but Baldwin didn't have much to do in his version and Philbin has a nice bit confrontation scene with Russell's Wyatt. Robert John Burke as Frank McLaury was so-so. I prefer Rex Linn's one. Billy Zane as Mr. Fabian was nice bit. perfect casting for Zane. Even Boothe's Curly says, "this is the handsomest man I have ever seen"! lol Buck Taylor as Turkey Creek Jack Johnson was better than Costner's version. Terry O'Quinn as Mayor John Clum was not bad at all. I wonder how he would have done in the Behan role instead. Frank Stallone as Ed Bailey had a nice cameo bit. And Robert Mitchum as the Narrator was not inspired but nice to hear the recognizable Mitchum tone in there. In the end, both films are good but as far as interpretations goes I gotta give it to Tombstone. But as storyline goes , Costner's versions wins there.

    I hate this movie. The makers of this dreck should be forced, like Alex in a Clockwork Orange, to watch "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" over and over and over again until they understand what a western should feel like. This is a Hollywood western, overacted, clich&eacute;, horse manure, the 90s equivalent of a Roy Rogers, all flair, with no depth or reality. Every line is this movie sounds like a catch phrase. Every shot in this movie looks like it belongs in a commercial or a music video. I suppose if you just want to be entertained, with brain left at home, then this crap might be for you. As for me, I'll take a dirty, gritty, Sergio Leone Clint Eastwood western any day.

    Tombstone is a "good looking movie"". That is one of the few reasons you should watch it. It is about 1% historically accurate. The story is absurd. The script is weak. The acting is poor. Val Kilmer is hysterically funny with his ridiculous "camped up" version of Doc Holliday. He should have won the razz in 1993 (he was robbed). Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp) tries too hard to be cool, and wearing his whiter than white shirts is highly amusing. I was not there, but I can assure you...the West was not like this...Tombstone was not a "cosmopolitan American Town". The story of Wyatt Earp, Tombstone, The O.K. corral, Etc. was nothing like this. Maybe this was made for young teenagers...Or maybe this is just a bad movie.

    If I were to list my all time favorite Westerns, Tombstone would definitely be at the top. I even love the director's cut that was release not to long ago that explained some missing pieces. Some critics have compared Tombstone with Wyatt Earp, which came out a year later. I believe this is an unfair comparison since Tombstone dealt with the events that happened in Tombstone, AZ and Wyatt Earp spanned more of Wyatt Earp's life before Tombstone, his life in Tombstone, and a little of his life after Tombstone. I love this movie because everything was made to look authentic. The facial hair was real, which is awesome... no fake hair on these guys faces. There is a scene with a thunderstorm that roles in and... it's real. One of my favorite scenes is when Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton), and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) first meet Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang), and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). In this scene Wyatt is dealing a faro game and he has just signed an autograph for a patron. Curly Bill grabs the autograph out of the man's hand and reads it. Ike jumps in and says that "law don't go round here." Wyatt informs him that he is retired. Johnny Ringo joins the conversation by looking at Doc Holliday and saying that he must be Doc Holliday. An exchange between the two ensues that could have gone wrong when Ringo draws his gun and begins spinning it. However, Doc uses a cup to diffuse the situation by spinning it in the same manner Ringo did. Another favorite scene is when Ike and Frank Stilwell (Thomas Arana) follow Wyatt and the rest of his family to Tucson to take Morgan's body to California. Ike and Frank are tasked to kill Wyatt and Virgil. Before they can complete their task Wyatt kills Frank. Wyatt walks up to a cowering Ike and takes his spur and cuts him at the corner of the mouth. Wyatt informs Ike that he is now a U.S. Marshall and that he is going to hunt down every Cowboy and kill them. The scene at the OK Corral is amazing. It is as close to what really happened as the film could get it without going back to October 26, 1881. I won't describe it because I wouldn't be able to do it justice and I want you to watch the movie if you haven't or again if you have. There are other scenes I liked as well. The movie itself is very good. This would have to be my absolute favorite Western movie of all time. I like this movie so much that I have remembered many of the various lines. Many of the lines Val Kilmer spoke as Doc Holliday are great, including, "I'm your Huckleberry". I give this 10 stars out of 10. I love this movie. I also recently read an article that told a story in which the original director was let go from this movie. A new director was hired and the production company whittled the script down significantly. Kurt Russell is also responsible for rallying the other actors and crew to finish the movie, said the same article.

    I don't watch movies to learn great things about history, I watch movies to be entertained. For me, the desire to watch a movie more than once is telling, and Tombstone is one of those movies that remains highly entertaining with repetitive viewings. The cast is perfect, Kurt Russell is a perfect Wyatt Earp, and Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holiday is nothing sort of amazing. How Kilmer was denied the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award is beyond my understanding. In my opinion, the very best American westerns include: (number 1) The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Unforgiven (along with most of Eastwood's other westerns) and now Tombstone should be added to that short list. If you watch movies to be entertained, as I do, even if you are not a Western fan, Tombstone is an entertaining classic. Watch it and you'll agree.

    Tombstone is a action packed western starring half of the Hollywood's character actors and action stars in film that slightly resembles a biopic of the legendary lawman Wyatt Earp. This film is a fun ride with good performances, great action, plenty of melodrama and mustaches. As a story, Tombstone is pretty uneven, the pacing is off after first hour, the editing leaves much to be desired, the villains are boring and one note, the plot starts and stops and starts all over again and the film is way too long. This film is one huge mess but thanks to the excellent performances by the cast, good action set pieces, great cinematography and the overpowering amount mustaches, the problems seem less important. There are three standout performances in this film - Kurt Russel, Sam Elliot and Val Kilmer. They pretty much carried the film on their own despite having some of the best supporting cast for film you can ever want. It's loaded with great character actors and Bill Zane to keep this very entertaining to watch. Also I really liked the how they handled the character of Doc Holliday. He was such a fascinating character and the performance by Val Kilmer was just right. They just should have made a film about him. Tombstone is an entertaining film and will not bore you if you like the actors enough and have certain appreciation of the classic, violent western. As a narrative it's pretty weak and rather forgettable, but the performances pretty much carry this film, at least for me.

    I personally feel it's difficult to break away from this Hollywood Pictures production, directed by George Cosmatos, with all the excitement found therein, as well as being filmed in a just-right location: namely the Old Tucson movie site. Kurt Russell played a mean-but-just Wyatt Earp. Sam Elliott was excellent as his brother Virgil. Bill Paxton portrayed Morgan Earp well. And you had no sympathy for the following people: Curly Bill Brocius (acted to a tee by Powers Boothe), Johnny Ringo (the mean man portrayed by Michael Biehn) and Ike Clanton (a fine turn by Stephen Lang.) John "Doc" Holiday was exactly like Val Kilmer, I'd say. Charlton Heston, though his role was rather small and his appearance in the movie was rather brief, did a great feat as Henry Hooker. Billy Zane, who was mean in "Titanic" showed that he could adapt to any role, playing the sissified stage actor he was. (He was definitely disgusting in places!) Robert Mitchum had a deep and clear voice, and he the narrator was also very articulate. And who wouldn't have fallen in love with Dana Delaney, the beautiful, charming lady who played the actress Josephine Marcus? She was virtually realistic as the lovely lady so good for Wyatt. And too, the experienced actor Harry Carey, Jr. was good in his brief role as the lawman he was. The gunfights were exciting, and not only the gunfight at the OK Corral. The only thing I didn't like about it were the bloody scenes. The dry, Old West was fitting, since the setting of the story was in Arizona. Again, it is one of the best western movies I've ever seen in all my years. Great!

    Tombstone is easily one of the greatest Western films of all time and an unforgettable classic that is filled with great direction,wonderful cast,fantastic Action,well-written screenplay and an amazing score and is not only one of my favorite Westerns of all time but one of my favorite films of all time. Set in Tombstone,Arizona in 1881,Tombstone tells the story of Wyatt Earp(Kurt Russell),a lawman who recently retired who along with his two brothers Virgil Earp(Sam Elliot)and Morgan Earp(Bill Paxton)and their wives decide to start a new life in Tombstone. But Wyatt's plans to settle down and retire are ruined when Wyatt and his brothers have to deal with an outlaw gang called The Cowboys who want the Earps blood. Now with the help of their friend Doc Holliday(Val Kilmer),the Earps and Doc look to destroy The Cowboys at all costs. In 1993 and 1994 there were two Western films made about Western legend Wyatt Earp George P. Cosmatos' Tombstone in 1993 and Lawrence Kadsen's Wyatt Earp which came out a year later. Where as Tombstone was an intense Action film about the events that took place before and after the Gunfight At The O.K Corral,Wyatt Earp was an epic biopic about the man Wyatt Earp and while Wyatt Earp is a good film in it's own right Tombstone is just a better and fully realized film. Tombstone is just an excellent film from beginning to end and is one of those films when you turn on Tombstone you just never turn it off and you are glued to the screen. There have been many films about Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday and The Gunfight At The O.K Corral but Tombstone is a film that stands out and is in a league of it's own because while Tombstone is based on real characters and historical events the movie is a thrill ride that has memorable characters and tension like a tightrope and never lets the viewer go until the end. What I also love about Tombstone and the Western genre in general is that TS brings into the world of the Old West and shows viewers how the West really was where Lawman enforced the laws and Outlaws broke them and blood was spilled into the dust and dirt. The Western atmosphere is accurate and very realistic and comes off the screen. The portrayals of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday are great and is some of the best depictions of Wyatt and Doc ever put on the screen. In Tombstone Wyatt Earp is depicted as some one who cares about his family and friends and doesn't want to get involved or participate with the violence and uncontrolled chaos that is happening in Tombstone but at the same time Wyatt is tough,heroic and takes crap from no one whether it's The Cowboys or strangers on the street. In Tombstone Doc Holliday is a character who gambles and uses his guns as well as smarts and charisma to get out situations and when he's in a conversation. Doc is a character you will love as soon as he comes on screen. I also loved the friendship between Wyatt and Doc because it feels real and truthful and when you watch the film you can tell that Wyatt and Doc really care about one another and that their friendship is honest. The film's screenplay by Kevin Jarre is great and well-written,with Jarre's script giving the main characters fantastic dialog and great,memorable scenes that will stay with the viewer after the film is over. The Action scenes in Tombstone are amazing and intense with wonderful Western gunfights and is done with great build up wonderful tension and white hot suspense especially The Gunfight At The O.K Correl scene. The build up to The Gunfight At The O.K Correl is unforgettable and when the classic Gunfight happens it explodes like a bomb and is done in a rapid fire quickness and you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. The Gunfight At The O.K Correl in this film is one of the best Action movie gunfights in film history and will be remembered forever. The ending of the film is wonderful and will leave you sad and happy and is a great cap off to Tombstone. The whole cast is wonderful. Kurt Russell is excellent and at his best as Wyatt Earp,with Russell bringing grit,toughness and depth to the role and is truly memorable. Val Kilmer gives a brilliant,unforgettable Oscar worthy iconic scene stealing performance as Doc Holliday,with Kilmer bringing coolness,charisma,great dialog and humor to the role. Kilmer's performance is masterful and will stick with you. Sam Elliot(Virgil Earp) and Bill Paxton(Morgan Earp)give great performances as Wyatt's brothers. Powers Booth(Curly Bill Brocius),Michael Biehn(Johnny Ringo)and Stephen Lang(Ike Clanton)give fantastic performances as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Dana Delany is great and beautiful as Josephine Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Jon Tenney is wonderful as Behan,a corrupt County Sheriff. Also,lookout for appearances from Charlton Heston(Henry Rooker),Michael Rooker(Sherman McMasters),Harry Carey Jr.(Marshel Fred White),Thomas Haden Church(Billy Clanton),Billy Bob Thorton(Johnny Tyler),Robert Burke(Frank McLaury),Joanna Pucula(Kate),Billy Zane(Mr. Fabian),Jason Priestly(Billy Breckinridge),Dana Wheeler-Nicholson(Mattie Earp),Terry O'Quinn(Mayor John Clum),John Corbett(Barnes),Pedro Armendariz Jr.(Priest)and Sly's younger brother Frank Stallone(Ed Bailey). The direction by George P. Cosmatos is excellent,with Cosmatos bringing an big,epic scope to the film and making the West look beautiful and glorious and wonderful shots of the sunlight and sky while Cosmatos also does a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Cosmatos. The score by Bruce Broughton is brilliant,epic,tragic and intense and matches the tone of the film and each scene. Great powerful score by Broughton. In final word,if you love Western films,Action films or films in general I highly suggest you see Tombstone,one of the best Westerns films of all time and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I am not a connoisseur of westerns but whenever this is on TV, I end up watching it again and again. It is the very best western I've ever seen. Val Kilmer is the real star of the film. He was not nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar. Neither was the movie nominated. Martin Landau was just OK in Ed Wood. Val Kilmer's every line in the movie is memorable and quotable." I'm your huckleberry." "Why Johnny Ringo, you look like someone just walked over your grave." " My hypocrisy knows no bound and so much more." His death scene brings tears to my eyes and is real acting. The Oscars no longer care about talent only marketing. I no longer pay attention to them anymore.

    Tombstone tells a tale that's been told over and over again, but manages to make it interesting. The good. Well done decor and costumes. Nice photography. Plenty of shootout. Interesting story. The actors. Kurt Russell did a credible job as Wyatt Earp, but it's probably the extent of his capabilities as you can see his limitations from time to time. Val Kilmer is absolutely excellent as his cultured, but edgy friend, Doc Holliday. Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton both give nice performances as his brothers. The bad.

    Tombstone is a "good looking movie"". That is one of the few reasons you should watch it. It is about 1% historically accurate. The story is absurd. The script is weak. The acting is poor. Val Kilmer is hysterically funny with his ridiculous "camped up" version of Doc Holliday. He should have won the razz in 1993 (he was robbed). Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp) tries too hard to be cool, and wearing his whiter than white shirts is highly amusing.

However, Doc uses a cup to diffuse the situation by spinning it in the same manner Ringo did. Another favorite scene is when Ike and Frank Stilwell (Thomas Arana) follow Wyatt and the rest of his family to Tucson to take Morgan's body to California. Ike and Frank are tasked to kill Wyatt and Virgil. Before they can complete their task Wyatt kills Frank. Wyatt walks up to a cowering Ike and takes his spur and cuts him at the corner of the mouth. Wyatt informs Ike that he is now a U.S. Marshall and that he is going to hunt down every Cowboy and kill them. The scene at the OK Corral is amazing. It is as close to what really happened as the film could get it without going back to October 26, 1881. I won't describe it because I wouldn't be able to do it justice and I want you to watch the movie if you haven't or again if you have. There are other scenes I liked as well. The movie itself is very good. This would have to be my absolute favorite Western movie of all time. I like this movie so much that I have remembered many of the various lines. Many of the lines Val Kilmer spoke as Doc Holliday are great, including, "I'm your Huckleberry". I give this 10 stars out of 10. I love this movie. I also recently read an article that told a story in which the original director was let go from this movie. A new director was hired and the production company whittled the script down significantly. Kurt Russell is also responsible for rallying the other actors and crew to finish the movie, said the same article.

    I don't watch movies to learn great things about history, I watch movies to be entertained. For me, the desire to watch a movie more than once is telling, and Tombstone is one of those movies that remains highly entertaining with repetitive viewings. The cast is perfect, Kurt Russell is a perfect Wyatt Earp, and Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holiday is nothing sort of amazing. How Kilmer was denied the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award is beyond my understanding. In my opinion, the very best American westerns include: (number 1) The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Unforgiven (along with most of Eastwood's other westerns) and now Tombstone should be added to that short list. If you watch movies to be entertained, as I do, even if you are not a Western fan, Tombstone is an entertaining classic. Watch it and you'll agree.

    Tombstone is a action packed western starring half of the Hollywood's character actors and action stars in film that slightly resembles a biopic of the legendary lawman Wyatt Earp. This film is a fun ride with good performances, great action, plenty of melodrama and mustaches. As a story, Tombstone is pretty uneven, the pacing is off after first hour, the editing leaves much to be desired, the villains are boring and one note, the plot starts and stops and starts all over again and the film is way too long. This film is one huge mess but thanks to the excellent performances by the cast, good action set pieces, great cinematography and the overpowering amount mustaches, the problems seem less important. There are three standout performances in this film - Kurt Russel, Sam Elliot and Val Kilmer. They pretty much carried the film on their own despite having some of the best supporting cast for film you can ever want. It's loaded with great character actors and Bill Zane to keep this very entertaining to watch. Also I really liked the how they handled the character of Doc Holliday. He was such a fascinating character and the performance by Val Kilmer was just right. They just should have made a film about him. Tombstone is an entertaining film and will not bore you if you like the actors enough and have certain appreciation of the classic, violent western. As a narrative it's pretty weak and rather forgettable, but the performances pretty much carry this film, at least for me.

    I personally feel it's difficult to break away from this Hollywood Pictures production, directed by George Cosmatos, with all the excitement found therein, as well as being filmed in a just-right location: namely the Old Tucson movie site. Kurt Russell played a mean-but-just Wyatt Earp. Sam Elliott was excellent as his brother Virgil. Bill Paxton portrayed Morgan Earp well. And you had no sympathy for the following people: Curly Bill Brocius (acted to a tee by Powers Boothe), Johnny Ringo (the mean man portrayed by Michael Biehn) and Ike Clanton (a fine turn by Stephen Lang.) John "Doc" Holiday was exactly like Val Kilmer, I'd say. Charlton Heston, though his role was rather small and his appearance in the movie was rather brief, did a great feat as Henry Hooker. Billy Zane, who was mean in "Titanic" showed that he could adapt to any role, playing the sissified stage actor he was. (He was definitely disgusting in places!) Robert Mitchum had a deep and clear voice, and he the narrator was also very articulate. And who wouldn't have fallen in love with Dana Delaney, the beautiful, charming lady who played the actress Josephine Marcus? She was virtually realistic as the lovely lady so good for Wyatt. And too, the experienced actor Harry Carey, Jr. was good in his brief role as the lawman he was. The gunfights were exciting, and not only the gunfight at the OK Corral. The only thing I didn't like about it were the bloody scenes. The dry, Old West was fitting, since the setting of the story was in Arizona. Again, it is one of the best western movies I've ever seen in all my years. Great!

    Tombstone is easily one of the greatest Western films of all time and an unforgettable classic that is filled with great direction,wonderful cast,fantastic Action,well-written screenplay and an amazing score and is not only one of my favorite Westerns of all time but one of my favorite films of all time. Set in Tombstone,Arizona in 1881,Tombstone tells the story of Wyatt Earp(Kurt Russell),a lawman who recently retired who along with his two brothers Virgil Earp(Sam Elliot)and Morgan Earp(Bill Paxton)and their wives decide to start a new life in Tombstone. But Wyatt's plans to settle down and retire are ruined when Wyatt and his brothers have to deal with an outlaw gang called The Cowboys who want the Earps blood. Now with the help of their friend Doc Holliday(Val Kilmer),the Earps and Doc look to destroy The Cowboys at all costs. In 1993 and 1994 there were two Western films made about Western legend Wyatt Earp George P. Cosmatos' Tombstone in 1993 and Lawrence Kadsen's Wyatt Earp which came out a year later. Where as Tombstone was an intense Action film about the events that took place before and after the Gunfight At The O.K Corral,Wyatt Earp was an epic biopic about the man Wyatt Earp and while Wyatt Earp is a good film in it's own right Tombstone is just a better and fully realized film. Tombstone is just an excellent film from beginning to end and is one of those films when you turn on Tombstone you just never turn it off and you are glued to the screen. There have been many films about Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday and The Gunfight At The O.K Corral but Tombstone is a film that stands out and is in a league of it's own because while Tombstone is based on real characters and historical events the movie is a thrill ride that has memorable characters and tension like a tightrope and never lets the viewer go until the end. What I also love about Tombstone and the Western genre in general is that TS brings into the world of the Old West and shows viewers how the West really was where Lawman enforced the laws and Outlaws broke them and blood was spilled into the dust and dirt. The Western atmosphere is accurate and very realistic and comes off the screen. The portrayals of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday are great and is some of the best depictions of Wyatt and Doc ever put on the screen. In Tombstone Wyatt Earp is depicted as some one who cares about his family and friends and doesn't want to get involved or participate with the violence and uncontrolled chaos that is happening in Tombstone but at the same time Wyatt is tough,heroic and takes crap from no one whether it's The Cowboys or strangers on the street. In Tombstone Doc Holliday is a character who gambles and uses his guns as well as smarts and charisma to get out situations and when he's in a conversation. Doc is a character you will love as soon as he comes on screen. I also loved the friendship between Wyatt and Doc because it feels real and truthful and when you watch the film you can tell that Wyatt and Doc really care about one another and that their friendship is honest. The film's screenplay by Kevin Jarre is great and well-written,with Jarre's script giving the main characters fantastic dialog and great,memorable scenes that will stay with the viewer after the film is over. The Action scenes in Tombstone are amazing and intense with wonderful Western gunfights and is done with great build up wonderful tension and white hot suspense especially The Gunfight At The O.K Correl scene. The build up to The Gunfight At The O.K Correl is unforgettable and when the classic Gunfight happens it explodes like a bomb and is done in a rapid fire quickness and you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. The Gunfight At The O.K Correl in this film is one of the best Action movie gunfights in film history and will be remembered forever. The ending of the film is wonderful and will leave you sad and happy and is a great cap off to Tombstone. The whole cast is wonderful. Kurt Russell is excellent and at his best as Wyatt Earp,with Russell bringing grit,toughness and depth to the role and is truly memorable. Val Kilmer gives a brilliant,unforgettable Oscar worthy iconic scene stealing performance as Doc Holliday,with Kilmer bringing coolness,charisma,great dialog and humor to the role. Kilmer's performance is masterful and will stick with you. Sam Elliot(Virgil Earp) and Bill Paxton(Morgan Earp)give great performances as Wyatt's brothers. Powers Booth(Curly Bill Brocius),Michael Biehn(Johnny Ringo)and Stephen Lang(Ike Clanton)give fantastic performances as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Dana Delany is great and beautiful as Josephine Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Jon Tenney is wonderful as Behan,a corrupt County Sheriff. Also,lookout for appearances from Charlton Heston(Henry Rooker),Michael Rooker(Sherman McMasters),Harry Carey Jr.(Marshel Fred White),Thomas Haden Church(Billy Clanton),Billy Bob Thorton(Johnny Tyler),Robert Burke(Frank McLaury),Joanna Pucula(Kate),Billy Zane(Mr. Fabian),Jason Priestly(Billy Breckinridge),Dana Wheeler-Nicholson(Mattie Earp),Terry O'Quinn(Mayor John Clum),John Corbett(Barnes),Pedro Armendariz Jr.(Priest)and Sly's younger brother Frank Stallone(Ed Bailey). The direction by George P. Cosmatos is excellent,with Cosmatos bringing an big,epic scope to the film and making the West look beautiful and glorious and wonderful shots of the sunlight and sky while Cosmatos also does a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Cosmatos. The score by Bruce Broughton is brilliant,epic,tragic and intense and matches the tone of the film and each scene. Great powerful score by Broughton. In final word,if you love Western films,Action films or films in general I highly suggest you see Tombstone,one of the best Westerns films of all time and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I am not a connoisseur of westerns but whenever this is on TV, I end up watching it again and again. It is the very best western I've ever seen. Val Kilmer is the real star of the film. He was not nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar. Neither was the movie nominated. Martin Landau was just OK in Ed Wood. Val Kilmer's every line in the movie is memorable and quotable." I'm your huckleberry." "Why Johnny Ringo, you look like someone just walked over your grave." " My hypocrisy knows no bound and so much more." His death scene brings tears to my eyes and is real acting. The Oscars no longer care about talent only marketing. I no longer pay attention to them anymore.

    Tombstone tells a tale that's been told over and over again, but manages to make it interesting. The good. Well done decor and costumes. Nice photography. Plenty of shootout. Interesting story. The actors. Kurt Russell did a credible job as Wyatt Earp, but it's probably the extent of his capabilities as you can see his limitations from time to time. Val Kilmer is absolutely excellent as his cultured, but edgy friend, Doc Holliday. Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton both give nice performances as his brothers. The bad. The river scene is of poor quality, Russell overdoing it by a fair margin, probably under the direction of the director. There are a few scenes where he's not at his best, but that one is the worst. The ugly. Nothing. The result. Excellent western action entertainment. Recommended to those who like the genre and the fans of Russell or Kilmer.

    I saw this one back-to-back with Kevin Costner's 'Wyatt Earp'(1994) movie and wow, what a difference in similarities. I will compare both films characters and interpretations , if applicable, and come to a conclusion at the end. Kurt Russell's Wyatt was not bad. I enjoyed it. This Earp story was more about like the title, about just that. Costner's was more how Wyatt Earp became the famous Earp from the beginning. So it's a tie as who did a better Wyatt Earp. Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday was a surprise. I felt he did a great job just as Dennis Quaid did with his. Very difficult on this also. I give it a tie also. Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp was right on casting. As this great actor personifies the ideal cowboy to me. Michael Madsen's interpretation was not bad but Elliott just nailed it. Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, also a great casting. I prefer Paxton's over Linden Ashby's. Even though Paxton's death scene was more Hollywood-ish and Ashby's more real and the Earp woman were more real in Costner's version. Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocius was a treat. Again Boothe wins over Lewis Smith's one. Boothe was sneaky, sinister and just slimy evil. Great casting even though he looked more ethnic per say. When I 1st saw him I really thought he was a Mexican bandido or something. lol Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo wins big time. Not only did Biehn do a phenomenal great job, the Ringo character was much more displayed and played a vital role here than Costner's one! The final showdown of Biehns Ringo with Kilmer's Holliday is classic! Charlton Heston as Henry Hooker was more like a glorified cameo and that's all. Still nice to see the late great Heston in a modern western regardless. Jason Priestley as Billy Breckinridge I felt was a OK but not enough screen time for this young actor so I feel he was wasted per say. Both these characters were not portrayed in the Costner version. Jon Tenney as Sheriff Johnny Behan was I believe a tie with Mark Harmon's. Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton was just great. A tie with Jeff Fahey's, who was also great. Thomas Haden Church as Billy Clanton was much better than Costner's version. Dana Delany as Josephine Marcus. was not bad but I gotta give it to Joanna Going's version. Both very beautiful actresses and they needed someone like that to interpret the Josephine role to make it believable that Wyatt would be mesmerized by this woman. Paula Malcomson as Allie Earp loses to the great Catherine O'Hara's version. Even the beautiful Dana Wheeler-Nicholson's Mattie Blaylock loses to Mare Winningham's version. Joanna Pacula's take on Big Nose Kate was way more believable than Isabella Rossellini's. But then again Isabella wasn't given much screen time and some of her scenes were cut, so who knows, had Isabella had more to do she could have given Pacula a run for her money. Michael Rooker as Sherman McMasters was not bad but short. Still it was way better than Todd Allen's in Costner's version. Billy Bob Thornton as Johnny Tyler was a nice treat. Paul Ben-Victor as Florentino was amusing. John Philbin as Tom McLaury was a nice bit. His was better than Adam Baldwin's one even though Baldwin's was more menacing as he stands 6'4" but Baldwin didn't have much to do in his version and Philbin has a nice bit confrontation scene with Russell's Wyatt. Robert John Burke as Frank McLaury was so-so. I prefer Rex Linn's one. Billy Zane as Mr. Fabian was nice bit. perfect casting for Zane. Even Boothe's Curly says, "this is the handsomest man I have ever seen"! lol Buck Taylor as Turkey Creek Jack Johnson was better than Costner's version. Terry O'Quinn as Mayor John Clum was not bad at all. I wonder how he would have done in the Behan role instead. Frank Stallone as Ed Bailey had a nice cameo bit. And Robert Mitchum as the Narrator was not inspired but nice to hear the recognizable Mitchum tone in there. In the end, both films are good but as far as interpretations goes I gotta give it to Tombstone. But as storyline goes , Costner's versions wins there.

    I hate this movie. The makers of this dreck should be forced, like Alex in a Clockwork Orange, to watch "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" over and over and over again until they understand what a western should feel like. This is a Hollywood western, overacted, clich&eacute;, horse manure, the 90s equivalent of a Roy Rogers, all flair, with no depth or reality. Every line is this movie sounds like a catch phrase. Every shot in this movie looks like it belongs in a commercial or a music video. I suppose if you just want to be entertained, with brain left at home, then this crap might be for you. As for me, I'll take a dirty, gritty, Sergio Leone Clint Eastwood western any day.

    Tombstone is a "good looking movie"". That is one of the few reasons you should watch it. It is about 1% historically accurate. The story is absurd. The script is weak. The acting is poor. Val Kilmer is hysterically funny with his ridiculous "camped up" version of Doc Holliday. He should have won the razz in 1993 (he was robbed). Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp) tries too hard to be cool, and wearing his whiter than white shirts is highly amusing. I was not there, but I can assure you...the West was not like this...Tombstone was not a "cosmopolitan American Town". The story of Wyatt Earp, Tombstone, The O.K. corral, Etc. was nothing like this. Maybe this was made for young teenagers...Or maybe this is just a bad movie.

    If I were to list my all time favorite Westerns, Tombstone would definitely be at the top. I even love the director's cut that was release not to long ago that explained some missing pieces. Some critics have compared Tombstone with Wyatt Earp, which came out a year later. I believe this is an unfair comparison since Tombstone dealt with the events that happened in Tombstone, AZ and Wyatt Earp spanned more of Wyatt Earp's life before Tombstone, his life in Tombstone, and a little of his life after Tombstone. I love this movie because everything was made to look authentic. The facial hair was real, which is awesome... no fake hair on these guys faces. There is a scene with a thunderstorm that roles in and... it's real. One of my favorite scenes is when Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton), and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) first meet Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang), and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). In this scene Wyatt is dealing a faro game and he has just signed an autograph for a patron. Curly Bill grabs the autograph out of the man's hand and reads it. Ike jumps in and says that "law don't go round here." Wyatt informs him that he is retired. Johnny Ringo joins the conversation by looking at Doc Holliday and saying that he must be Doc Holliday. An exchange between the two ensues that could have gone wrong when Ringo draws his gun and begins spinning it. However, Doc uses a cup to diffuse the situation by spinning it in the same manner Ringo did. Another favorite scene is when Ike and Frank Stilwell (Thomas Arana) follow Wyatt and the rest of his family to Tucson to take Morgan's body to California. Ike and Frank are tasked to kill Wyatt and Virgil. Before they can complete their task Wyatt kills Frank. Wyatt walks up to a cowering Ike and takes his spur and cuts him at the corner of the mouth. Wyatt informs Ike that he is now a U.S. Marshall and that he is going to hunt down every Cowboy and kill them. The scene at the OK Corral is amazing. It is as close to what really happened as the film could get it without going back to October 26, 1881. I won't describe it because I wouldn't be able to do it justice and I want you to watch the movie if you haven't or again if you have. There are other scenes I liked as well. The movie itself is very good. This would have to be my absolute favorite Western movie of all time. I like this movie so much that I have remembered many of the various lines. Many of the lines Val Kilmer spoke as Doc Holliday are great, including, "I'm your Huckleberry". I give this 10 stars out of 10. I love this movie. I also recently read an article that told a story in which the original director was let go from this movie. A new director was hired and the production company whittled the script down significantly. Kurt Russell is also responsible for rallying the other actors and crew to finish the movie, said the same article.

In Tombstone Doc Holliday is a character who gambles and uses his guns as well as smarts and charisma to get out situations and when he's in a conversation. Doc is a character you will love as soon as he comes on screen. I also loved the friendship between Wyatt and Doc because it feels real and truthful and when you watch the film you can tell that Wyatt and Doc really care about one another and that their friendship is honest. The film's screenplay by Kevin Jarre is great and well-written,with Jarre's script giving the main characters fantastic dialog and great,memorable scenes that will stay with the viewer after the film is over. The Action scenes in Tombstone are amazing and intense with wonderful Western gunfights and is done with great build up wonderful tension and white hot suspense especially The Gunfight At The O.K Correl scene. The build up to The Gunfight At The O.K Correl is unforgettable and when the classic Gunfight happens it explodes like a bomb and is done in a rapid fire quickness and you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. The Gunfight At The O.K Correl in this film is one of the best Action movie gunfights in film history and will be remembered forever. The ending of the film is wonderful and will leave you sad and happy and is a great cap off to Tombstone. The whole cast is wonderful. Kurt Russell is excellent and at his best as Wyatt Earp,with Russell bringing grit,toughness and depth to the role and is truly memorable. Val Kilmer gives a brilliant,unforgettable Oscar worthy iconic scene stealing performance as Doc Holliday,with Kilmer bringing coolness,charisma,great dialog and humor to the role. Kilmer's performance is masterful and will stick with you. Sam Elliot(Virgil Earp) and Bill Paxton(Morgan Earp)give great performances as Wyatt's brothers. Powers Booth(Curly Bill Brocius),Michael Biehn(Johnny Ringo)and Stephen Lang(Ike Clanton)give fantastic performances as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Dana Delany is great and beautiful as Josephine Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Jon Tenney is wonderful as Behan,a corrupt County Sheriff. Also,lookout for appearances from Charlton Heston(Henry Rooker),Michael Rooker(Sherman McMasters),Harry Carey Jr.(Marshel Fred White),Thomas Haden Church(Billy Clanton),Billy Bob Thorton(Johnny Tyler),Robert Burke(Frank McLaury),Joanna Pucula(Kate),Billy Zane(Mr. Fabian),Jason Priestly(Billy Breckinridge),Dana Wheeler-Nicholson(Mattie Earp),Terry O'Quinn(Mayor John Clum),John Corbett(Barnes),Pedro Armendariz Jr.(Priest)and Sly's younger brother Frank Stallone(Ed Bailey). The direction by George P. Cosmatos is excellent,with Cosmatos bringing an big,epic scope to the film and making the West look beautiful and glorious and wonderful shots of the sunlight and sky while Cosmatos also does a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Cosmatos. The score by Bruce Broughton is brilliant,epic,tragic and intense and matches the tone of the film and each scene. Great powerful score by Broughton. In final word,if you love Western films,Action films or films in general I highly suggest you see Tombstone,one of the best Westerns films of all time and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I am not a connoisseur of westerns but whenever this is on TV, I end up watching it again and again. It is the very best western I've ever seen. Val Kilmer is the real star of the film. He was not nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar. Neither was the movie nominated. Martin Landau was just OK in Ed Wood. Val Kilmer's every line in the movie is memorable and quotable." I'm your huckleberry." "Why Johnny Ringo, you look like someone just walked over your grave." " My hypocrisy knows no bound and so much more." His death scene brings tears to my eyes and is real acting. The Oscars no longer care about talent only marketing. I no longer pay attention to them anymore.

    Tombstone tells a tale that's been told over and over again, but manages to make it interesting. The good. Well done decor and costumes. Nice photography. Plenty of shootout. Interesting story. The actors. Kurt Russell did a credible job as Wyatt Earp, but it's probably the extent of his capabilities as you can see his limitations from time to time. Val Kilmer is absolutely excellent as his cultured, but edgy friend, Doc Holliday. Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton both give nice performances as his brothers. The bad. The river scene is of poor quality, Russell overdoing it by a fair margin, probably under the direction of the director. There are a few scenes where he's not at his best, but that one is the worst. The ugly. Nothing. The result. Excellent western action entertainment. Recommended to those who like the genre and the fans of Russell or Kilmer.

    I saw this one back-to-back with Kevin Costner's 'Wyatt Earp'(1994) movie and wow, what a difference in similarities. I will compare both films characters and interpretations , if applicable, and come to a conclusion at the end. Kurt Russell's Wyatt was not bad. I enjoyed it. This Earp story was more about like the title, about just that. Costner's was more how Wyatt Earp became the famous Earp from the beginning. So it's a tie as who did a better Wyatt Earp. Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday was a surprise. I felt he did a great job just as Dennis Quaid did with his. Very difficult on this also. I give it a tie also. Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp was right on casting. As this great actor personifies the ideal cowboy to me. Michael Madsen's interpretation was not bad but Elliott just nailed it. Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, also a great casting. I prefer Paxton's over Linden Ashby's. Even though Paxton's death scene was more Hollywood-ish and Ashby's more real and the Earp woman were more real in Costner's version. Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocius was a treat. Again Boothe wins over Lewis Smith's one. Boothe was sneaky, sinister and just slimy evil. Great casting even though he looked more ethnic per say. When I 1st saw him I really thought he was a Mexican bandido or something. lol Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo wins big time. Not only did Biehn do a phenomenal great job, the Ringo character was much more displayed and played a vital role here than Costner's one! The final showdown of Biehns Ringo with Kilmer's Holliday is classic! Charlton Heston as Henry Hooker was more like a glorified cameo and that's all. Still nice to see the late great Heston in a modern western regardless. Jason Priestley as Billy Breckinridge I felt was a OK but not enough screen time for this young actor so I feel he was wasted per say. Both these characters were not portrayed in the Costner version. Jon Tenney as Sheriff Johnny Behan was I believe a tie with Mark Harmon's. Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton was just great. A tie with Jeff Fahey's, who was also great. Thomas Haden Church as Billy Clanton was much better than Costner's version. Dana Delany as Josephine Marcus. was not bad but I gotta give it to Joanna Going's version. Both very beautiful actresses and they needed someone like that to interpret the Josephine role to make it believable that Wyatt would be mesmerized by this woman. Paula Malcomson as Allie Earp loses to the great Catherine O'Hara's version. Even the beautiful Dana Wheeler-Nicholson's Mattie Blaylock loses to Mare Winningham's version. Joanna Pacula's take on Big Nose Kate was way more believable than Isabella Rossellini's. But then again Isabella wasn't given much screen time and some of her scenes were cut, so who knows, had Isabella had more to do she could have given Pacula a run for her money. Michael Rooker as Sherman McMasters was not bad but short. Still it was way better than Todd Allen's in Costner's version. Billy Bob Thornton as Johnny Tyler was a nice treat. Paul Ben-Victor as Florentino was amusing. John Philbin as Tom McLaury was a nice bit. His was better than Adam Baldwin's one even though Baldwin's was more menacing as he stands 6'4" but Baldwin didn't have much to do in his version and Philbin has a nice bit confrontation scene with Russell's Wyatt. Robert John Burke as Frank McLaury was so-so. I prefer Rex Linn's one. Billy Zane as Mr. Fabian was nice bit. perfect casting for Zane. Even Boothe's Curly says, "this is the handsomest man I have ever seen"! lol Buck Taylor as Turkey Creek Jack Johnson was better than Costner's version. Terry O'Quinn as Mayor John Clum was not bad at all. I wonder how he would have done in the Behan role instead. Frank Stallone as Ed Bailey had a nice cameo bit. And Robert Mitchum as the Narrator was not inspired but nice to hear the recognizable Mitchum tone in there. In the end, both films are good but as far as interpretations goes I gotta give it to Tombstone. But as storyline goes , Costner's versions wins there.

    I hate this movie. The makers of this dreck should be forced, like Alex in a Clockwork Orange, to watch "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" over and over and over again until they understand what a western should feel like. This is a Hollywood western, overacted, clich&eacute;, horse manure, the 90s equivalent of a Roy Rogers, all flair, with no depth or reality. Every line is this movie sounds like a catch phrase. Every shot in this movie looks like it belongs in a commercial or a music video. I suppose if you just want to be entertained, with brain left at home, then this crap might be for you. As for me, I'll take a dirty, gritty, Sergio Leone Clint Eastwood western any day.

    Tombstone is a "good looking movie"". That is one of the few reasons you should watch it. It is about 1% historically accurate. The story is absurd. The script is weak. The acting is poor. Val Kilmer is hysterically funny with his ridiculous "camped up" version of Doc Holliday. He should have won the razz in 1993 (he was robbed). Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp) tries too hard to be cool, and wearing his whiter than white shirts is highly amusing. I was not there, but I can assure you...the West was not like this...Tombstone was not a "cosmopolitan American Town". The story of Wyatt Earp, Tombstone, The O.K. corral, Etc. was nothing like this. Maybe this was made for young teenagers...Or maybe this is just a bad movie.

    If I were to list my all time favorite Westerns, Tombstone would definitely be at the top. I even love the director's cut that was release not to long ago that explained some missing pieces. Some critics have compared Tombstone with Wyatt Earp, which came out a year later. I believe this is an unfair comparison since Tombstone dealt with the events that happened in Tombstone, AZ and Wyatt Earp spanned more of Wyatt Earp's life before Tombstone, his life in Tombstone, and a little of his life after Tombstone. I love this movie because everything was made to look authentic. The facial hair was real, which is awesome... no fake hair on these guys faces. There is a scene with a thunderstorm that roles in and... it's real. One of my favorite scenes is when Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton), and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) first meet Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang), and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). In this scene Wyatt is dealing a faro game and he has just signed an autograph for a patron. Curly Bill grabs the autograph out of the man's hand and reads it. Ike jumps in and says that "law don't go round here." Wyatt informs him that he is retired. Johnny Ringo joins the conversation by looking at Doc Holliday and saying that he must be Doc Holliday. An exchange between the two ensues that could have gone wrong when Ringo draws his gun and begins spinning it. However, Doc uses a cup to diffuse the situation by spinning it in the same manner Ringo did. Another favorite scene is when Ike and Frank Stilwell (Thomas Arana) follow Wyatt and the rest of his family to Tucson to take Morgan's body to California. Ike and Frank are tasked to kill Wyatt and Virgil. Before they can complete their task Wyatt kills Frank. Wyatt walks up to a cowering Ike and takes his spur and cuts him at the corner of the mouth. Wyatt informs Ike that he is now a U.S. Marshall and that he is going to hunt down every Cowboy and kill them. The scene at the OK Corral is amazing. It is as close to what really happened as the film could get it without going back to October 26, 1881. I won't describe it because I wouldn't be able to do it justice and I want you to watch the movie if you haven't or again if you have. There are other scenes I liked as well. The movie itself is very good. This would have to be my absolute favorite Western movie of all time. I like this movie so much that I have remembered many of the various lines. Many of the lines Val Kilmer spoke as Doc Holliday are great, including, "I'm your Huckleberry". I give this 10 stars out of 10. I love this movie. I also recently read an article that told a story in which the original director was let go from this movie. A new director was hired and the production company whittled the script down significantly. Kurt Russell is also responsible for rallying the other actors and crew to finish the movie, said the same article.

    I don't watch movies to learn great things about history, I watch movies to be entertained. For me, the desire to watch a movie more than once is telling, and Tombstone is one of those movies that remains highly entertaining with repetitive viewings. The cast is perfect, Kurt Russell is a perfect Wyatt Earp, and Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holiday is nothing sort of amazing. How Kilmer was denied the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award is beyond my understanding. In my opinion, the very best American westerns include: (number 1) The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Unforgiven (along with most of Eastwood's other westerns) and now Tombstone should be added to that short list. If you watch movies to be entertained, as I do, even if you are not a Western fan, Tombstone is an entertaining classic. Watch it and you'll agree.

    Tombstone is a action packed western starring half of the Hollywood's character actors and action stars in film that slightly resembles a biopic of the legendary lawman Wyatt Earp. This film is a fun ride with good performances, great action, plenty of melodrama and mustaches. As a story, Tombstone is pretty uneven, the pacing is off after first hour, the editing leaves much to be desired, the villains are boring and one note, the plot starts and stops and starts all over again and the film is way too long. This film is one huge mess but thanks to the excellent performances by the cast, good action set pieces, great cinematography and the overpowering amount mustaches, the problems seem less important. There are three standout performances in this film - Kurt Russel, Sam Elliot and Val Kilmer. They pretty much carried the film on their own despite having some of the best supporting cast for film you can ever want. It's loaded with great character actors and Bill Zane to keep this very entertaining to watch. Also I really liked the how they handled the character of Doc Holliday. He was such a fascinating character and the performance by Val Kilmer was just right. They just should have made a film about him. Tombstone is an entertaining film and will not bore you if you like the actors enough and have certain appreciation of the classic, violent western. As a narrative it's pretty weak and rather forgettable, but the performances pretty much carry this film, at least for me.

    I personally feel it's difficult to break away from this Hollywood Pictures production, directed by George Cosmatos, with all the excitement found therein, as well as being filmed in a just-right location: namely the Old Tucson movie site. Kurt Russell played a mean-but-just Wyatt Earp. Sam Elliott was excellent as his brother Virgil. Bill Paxton portrayed Morgan Earp well. And you had no sympathy for the following people: Curly Bill Brocius (acted to a tee by Powers Boothe), Johnny Ringo (the mean man portrayed by Michael Biehn) and Ike Clanton (a fine turn by Stephen Lang.) John "Doc" Holiday was exactly like Val Kilmer, I'd say. Charlton Heston, though his role was rather small and his appearance in the movie was rather brief, did a great feat as Henry Hooker. Billy Zane, who was mean in "Titanic" showed that he could adapt to any role, playing the sissified stage actor he was. (He was definitely disgusting in places!) Robert Mitchum had a deep and clear voice, and he the narrator was also very articulate. And who wouldn't have fallen in love with Dana Delaney, the beautiful, charming lady who played the actress Josephine Marcus? She was virtually realistic as the lovely lady so good for Wyatt. And too, the experienced actor Harry Carey, Jr. was good in his brief role as the lawman he was. The gunfights were exciting, and not only the gunfight at the OK Corral. The only thing I didn't like about it were the bloody scenes. The dry, Old West was fitting, since the setting of the story was in Arizona. Again, it is one of the best western movies I've ever seen in all my years. Great!

    Tombstone is easily one of the greatest Western films of all time and an unforgettable classic that is filled with great direction,wonderful cast,fantastic Action,well-written screenplay and an amazing score and is not only one of my favorite Westerns of all time but one of my favorite films of all time. Set in Tombstone,Arizona in 1881,Tombstone tells the story of Wyatt Earp(Kurt Russell),a lawman who recently retired who along with his two brothers Virgil Earp(Sam Elliot)and Morgan Earp(Bill Paxton)and their wives decide to start a new life in Tombstone. But Wyatt's plans to settle down and retire are ruined when Wyatt and his brothers have to deal with an outlaw gang called The Cowboys who want the Earps blood. Now with the help of their friend Doc Holliday(Val Kilmer),the Earps and Doc look to destroy The Cowboys at all costs. In 1993 and 1994 there were two Western films made about Western legend Wyatt Earp George P. Cosmatos' Tombstone in 1993 and Lawrence Kadsen's Wyatt Earp which came out a year later. Where as Tombstone was an intense Action film about the events that took place before and after the Gunfight At The O.K Corral,Wyatt Earp was an epic biopic about the man Wyatt Earp and while Wyatt Earp is a good film in it's own right Tombstone is just a better and fully realized film. Tombstone is just an excellent film from beginning to end and is one of those films when you turn on Tombstone you just never turn it off and you are glued to the screen. There have been many films about Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday and The Gunfight At The O.K Corral but Tombstone is a film that stands out and is in a league of it's own because while Tombstone is based on real characters and historical events the movie is a thrill ride that has memorable characters and tension like a tightrope and never lets the viewer go until the end. What I also love about Tombstone and the Western genre in general is that TS brings into the world of the Old West and shows viewers how the West really was where Lawman enforced the laws and Outlaws broke them and blood was spilled into the dust and dirt. The Western atmosphere is accurate and very realistic and comes off the screen. The portrayals of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday are great and is some of the best depictions of Wyatt and Doc ever put on the screen. In Tombstone Wyatt Earp is depicted as some one who cares about his family and friends and doesn't want to get involved or participate with the violence and uncontrolled chaos that is happening in Tombstone but at the same time Wyatt is tough,heroic and takes crap from no one whether it's The Cowboys or strangers on the street. In Tombstone Doc Holliday is a character who gambles and uses his guns as well as smarts and charisma to get out situations and when he's in a conversation. Doc is a character you will love as soon as he comes on screen. I also loved the friendship between Wyatt and Doc because it feels real and truthful and when you watch the film you can tell that Wyatt and Doc really care about one another and that their friendship is honest. The film's screenplay by Kevin Jarre is great and well-written,with Jarre's script giving the main characters fantastic dialog and great,memorable scenes that will stay with the viewer after the film is over. The Action scenes in Tombstone are amazing and intense with wonderful Western gunfights and is done with great build up wonderful tension and white hot suspense especially The Gunfight At The O.K Correl scene. The build up to The Gunfight At The O.K Correl is unforgettable and when the classic Gunfight happens it explodes like a bomb and is done in a rapid fire quickness and you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. The Gunfight At The O.K Correl in this film is one of the best Action movie gunfights in film history and will be remembered forever. The ending of the film is wonderful and will leave you sad and happy and is a great cap off to Tombstone. The whole cast is wonderful. Kurt Russell is excellent and at his best as Wyatt Earp,with Russell bringing grit,toughness and depth to the role and is truly memorable. Val Kilmer gives a brilliant,unforgettable Oscar worthy iconic scene stealing performance as Doc Holliday,with Kilmer bringing coolness,charisma,great dialog and humor to the role. Kilmer's performance is masterful and will stick with you. Sam Elliot(Virgil Earp) and Bill Paxton(Morgan Earp)give great performances as Wyatt's brothers. Powers Booth(Curly Bill Brocius),Michael Biehn(Johnny Ringo)and Stephen Lang(Ike Clanton)give fantastic performances as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Dana Delany is great and beautiful as Josephine Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Jon Tenney is wonderful as Behan,a corrupt County Sheriff. Also,lookout for appearances from Charlton Heston(Henry Rooker),Michael Rooker(Sherman McMasters),Harry Carey Jr.(Marshel Fred White),Thomas Haden Church(Billy Clanton),Billy Bob Thorton(Johnny Tyler),Robert Burke(Frank McLaury),Joanna Pucula(Kate),Billy Zane(Mr. Fabian),Jason Priestly(Billy Breckinridge),Dana Wheeler-Nicholson(Mattie Earp),Terry O'Quinn(Mayor John Clum),John Corbett(Barnes),Pedro Armendariz Jr.(Priest)and Sly's younger brother Frank Stallone(Ed Bailey). The direction by George P. Cosmatos is excellent,with Cosmatos bringing an big,epic scope to the film and making the West look beautiful and glorious and wonderful shots of the sunlight and sky while Cosmatos also does a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Cosmatos. The score by Bruce Broughton is brilliant,epic,tragic and intense and matches the tone of the film and each scene. Great powerful score by Broughton. In final word,if you love Western films,Action films or films in general I highly suggest you see Tombstone,one of the best Westerns films of all time and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

His was better than Adam Baldwin's one even though Baldwin's was more menacing as he stands 6'4" but Baldwin didn't have much to do in his version and Philbin has a nice bit confrontation scene with Russell's Wyatt. Robert John Burke as Frank McLaury was so-so. I prefer Rex Linn's one. Billy Zane as Mr. Fabian was nice bit. perfect casting for Zane. Even Boothe's Curly says, "this is the handsomest man I have ever seen"! lol Buck Taylor as Turkey Creek Jack Johnson was better than Costner's version. Terry O'Quinn as Mayor John Clum was not bad at all. I wonder how he would have done in the Behan role instead. Frank Stallone as Ed Bailey had a nice cameo bit. And Robert Mitchum as the Narrator was not inspired but nice to hear the recognizable Mitchum tone in there. In the end, both films are good but as far as interpretations goes I gotta give it to Tombstone. But as storyline goes , Costner's versions wins there.

    I hate this movie. The makers of this dreck should be forced, like Alex in a Clockwork Orange, to watch "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" over and over and over again until they understand what a western should feel like. This is a Hollywood western, overacted, clich&eacute;, horse manure, the 90s equivalent of a Roy Rogers, all flair, with no depth or reality. Every line is this movie sounds like a catch phrase. Every shot in this movie looks like it belongs in a commercial or a music video. I suppose if you just want to be entertained, with brain left at home, then this crap might be for you. As for me, I'll take a dirty, gritty, Sergio Leone Clint Eastwood western any day.

    Tombstone is a "good looking movie"". That is one of the few reasons you should watch it. It is about 1% historically accurate. The story is absurd. The script is weak. The acting is poor. Val Kilmer is hysterically funny with his ridiculous "camped up" version of Doc Holliday. He should have won the razz in 1993 (he was robbed). Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp) tries too hard to be cool, and wearing his whiter than white shirts is highly amusing. I was not there, but I can assure you...the West was not like this...Tombstone was not a "cosmopolitan American Town". The story of Wyatt Earp, Tombstone, The O.K. corral, Etc. was nothing like this. Maybe this was made for young teenagers...Or maybe this is just a bad movie.

    If I were to list my all time favorite Westerns, Tombstone would definitely be at the top. I even love the director's cut that was release not to long ago that explained some missing pieces. Some critics have compared Tombstone with Wyatt Earp, which came out a year later. I believe this is an unfair comparison since Tombstone dealt with the events that happened in Tombstone, AZ and Wyatt Earp spanned more of Wyatt Earp's life before Tombstone, his life in Tombstone, and a little of his life after Tombstone. I love this movie because everything was made to look authentic. The facial hair was real, which is awesome... no fake hair on these guys faces. There is a scene with a thunderstorm that roles in and... it's real. One of my favorite scenes is when Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton), and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) first meet Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang), and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). In this scene Wyatt is dealing a faro game and he has just signed an autograph for a patron. Curly Bill grabs the autograph out of the man's hand and reads it. Ike jumps in and says that "law don't go round here." Wyatt informs him that he is retired. Johnny Ringo joins the conversation by looking at Doc Holliday and saying that he must be Doc Holliday. An exchange between the two ensues that could have gone wrong when Ringo draws his gun and begins spinning it. However, Doc uses a cup to diffuse the situation by spinning it in the same manner Ringo did. Another favorite scene is when Ike and Frank Stilwell (Thomas Arana) follow Wyatt and the rest of his family to Tucson to take Morgan's body to California. Ike and Frank are tasked to kill Wyatt and Virgil. Before they can complete their task Wyatt kills Frank. Wyatt walks up to a cowering Ike and takes his spur and cuts him at the corner of the mouth. Wyatt informs Ike that he is now a U.S. Marshall and that he is going to hunt down every Cowboy and kill them. The scene at the OK Corral is amazing. It is as close to what really happened as the film could get it without going back to October 26, 1881. I won't describe it because I wouldn't be able to do it justice and I want you to watch the movie if you haven't or again if you have. There are other scenes I liked as well. The movie itself is very good. This would have to be my absolute favorite Western movie of all time. I like this movie so much that I have remembered many of the various lines. Many of the lines Val Kilmer spoke as Doc Holliday are great, including, "I'm your Huckleberry". I give this 10 stars out of 10. I love this movie. I also recently read an article that told a story in which the original director was let go from this movie. A new director was hired and the production company whittled the script down significantly. Kurt Russell is also responsible for rallying the other actors and crew to finish the movie, said the same article.

    I don't watch movies to learn great things about history, I watch movies to be entertained. For me, the desire to watch a movie more than once is telling, and Tombstone is one of those movies that remains highly entertaining with repetitive viewings. The cast is perfect, Kurt Russell is a perfect Wyatt Earp, and Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holiday is nothing sort of amazing. How Kilmer was denied the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award is beyond my understanding. In my opinion, the very best American westerns include: (number 1) The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Unforgiven (along with most of Eastwood's other westerns) and now Tombstone should be added to that short list. If you watch movies to be entertained, as I do, even if you are not a Western fan, Tombstone is an entertaining classic. Watch it and you'll agree.

    Tombstone is a action packed western starring half of the Hollywood's character actors and action stars in film that slightly resembles a biopic of the legendary lawman Wyatt Earp. This film is a fun ride with good performances, great action, plenty of melodrama and mustaches. As a story, Tombstone is pretty uneven, the pacing is off after first hour, the editing leaves much to be desired, the villains are boring and one note, the plot starts and stops and starts all over again and the film is way too long. This film is one huge mess but thanks to the excellent performances by the cast, good action set pieces, great cinematography and the overpowering amount mustaches, the problems seem less important. There are three standout performances in this film - Kurt Russel, Sam Elliot and Val Kilmer. They pretty much carried the film on their own despite having some of the best supporting cast for film you can ever want. It's loaded with great character actors and Bill Zane to keep this very entertaining to watch. Also I really liked the how they handled the character of Doc Holliday. He was such a fascinating character and the performance by Val Kilmer was just right. They just should have made a film about him. Tombstone is an entertaining film and will not bore you if you like the actors enough and have certain appreciation of the classic, violent western. As a narrative it's pretty weak and rather forgettable, but the performances pretty much carry this film, at least for me.

    I personally feel it's difficult to break away from this Hollywood Pictures production, directed by George Cosmatos, with all the excitement found therein, as well as being filmed in a just-right location: namely the Old Tucson movie site. Kurt Russell played a mean-but-just Wyatt Earp. Sam Elliott was excellent as his brother Virgil. Bill Paxton portrayed Morgan Earp well. And you had no sympathy for the following people: Curly Bill Brocius (acted to a tee by Powers Boothe), Johnny Ringo (the mean man portrayed by Michael Biehn) and Ike Clanton (a fine turn by Stephen Lang.) John "Doc" Holiday was exactly like Val Kilmer, I'd say. Charlton Heston, though his role was rather small and his appearance in the movie was rather brief, did a great feat as Henry Hooker. Billy Zane, who was mean in "Titanic" showed that he could adapt to any role, playing the sissified stage actor he was. (He was definitely disgusting in places!) Robert Mitchum had a deep and clear voice, and he the narrator was also very articulate. And who wouldn't have fallen in love with Dana Delaney, the beautiful, charming lady who played the actress Josephine Marcus? She was virtually realistic as the lovely lady so good for Wyatt. And too, the experienced actor Harry Carey, Jr. was good in his brief role as the lawman he was. The gunfights were exciting, and not only the gunfight at the OK Corral. The only thing I didn't like about it were the bloody scenes. The dry, Old West was fitting, since the setting of the story was in Arizona. Again, it is one of the best western movies I've ever seen in all my years. Great!

    Tombstone is easily one of the greatest Western films of all time and an unforgettable classic that is filled with great direction,wonderful cast,fantastic Action,well-written screenplay and an amazing score and is not only one of my favorite Westerns of all time but one of my favorite films of all time. Set in Tombstone,Arizona in 1881,Tombstone tells the story of Wyatt Earp(Kurt Russell),a lawman who recently retired who along with his two brothers Virgil Earp(Sam Elliot)and Morgan Earp(Bill Paxton)and their wives decide to start a new life in Tombstone. But Wyatt's plans to settle down and retire are ruined when Wyatt and his brothers have to deal with an outlaw gang called The Cowboys who want the Earps blood. Now with the help of their friend Doc Holliday(Val Kilmer),the Earps and Doc look to destroy The Cowboys at all costs. In 1993 and 1994 there were two Western films made about Western legend Wyatt Earp George P. Cosmatos' Tombstone in 1993 and Lawrence Kadsen's Wyatt Earp which came out a year later. Where as Tombstone was an intense Action film about the events that took place before and after the Gunfight At The O.K Corral,Wyatt Earp was an epic biopic about the man Wyatt Earp and while Wyatt Earp is a good film in it's own right Tombstone is just a better and fully realized film. Tombstone is just an excellent film from beginning to end and is one of those films when you turn on Tombstone you just never turn it off and you are glued to the screen. There have been many films about Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday and The Gunfight At The O.K Corral but Tombstone is a film that stands out and is in a league of it's own because while Tombstone is based on real characters and historical events the movie is a thrill ride that has memorable characters and tension like a tightrope and never lets the viewer go until the end. What I also love about Tombstone and the Western genre in general is that TS brings into the world of the Old West and shows viewers how the West really was where Lawman enforced the laws and Outlaws broke them and blood was spilled into the dust and dirt. The Western atmosphere is accurate and very realistic and comes off the screen. The portrayals of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday are great and is some of the best depictions of Wyatt and Doc ever put on the screen. In Tombstone Wyatt Earp is depicted as some one who cares about his family and friends and doesn't want to get involved or participate with the violence and uncontrolled chaos that is happening in Tombstone but at the same time Wyatt is tough,heroic and takes crap from no one whether it's The Cowboys or strangers on the street. In Tombstone Doc Holliday is a character who gambles and uses his guns as well as smarts and charisma to get out situations and when he's in a conversation. Doc is a character you will love as soon as he comes on screen. I also loved the friendship between Wyatt and Doc because it feels real and truthful and when you watch the film you can tell that Wyatt and Doc really care about one another and that their friendship is honest. The film's screenplay by Kevin Jarre is great and well-written,with Jarre's script giving the main characters fantastic dialog and great,memorable scenes that will stay with the viewer after the film is over. The Action scenes in Tombstone are amazing and intense with wonderful Western gunfights and is done with great build up wonderful tension and white hot suspense especially The Gunfight At The O.K Correl scene. The build up to The Gunfight At The O.K Correl is unforgettable and when the classic Gunfight happens it explodes like a bomb and is done in a rapid fire quickness and you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. The Gunfight At The O.K Correl in this film is one of the best Action movie gunfights in film history and will be remembered forever. The ending of the film is wonderful and will leave you sad and happy and is a great cap off to Tombstone. The whole cast is wonderful. Kurt Russell is excellent and at his best as Wyatt Earp,with Russell bringing grit,toughness and depth to the role and is truly memorable. Val Kilmer gives a brilliant,unforgettable Oscar worthy iconic scene stealing performance as Doc Holliday,with Kilmer bringing coolness,charisma,great dialog and humor to the role. Kilmer's performance is masterful and will stick with you. Sam Elliot(Virgil Earp) and Bill Paxton(Morgan Earp)give great performances as Wyatt's brothers. Powers Booth(Curly Bill Brocius),Michael Biehn(Johnny Ringo)and Stephen Lang(Ike Clanton)give fantastic performances as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Dana Delany is great and beautiful as Josephine Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Jon Tenney is wonderful as Behan,a corrupt County Sheriff. Also,lookout for appearances from Charlton Heston(Henry Rooker),Michael Rooker(Sherman McMasters),Harry Carey Jr.(Marshel Fred White),Thomas Haden Church(Billy Clanton),Billy Bob Thorton(Johnny Tyler),Robert Burke(Frank McLaury),Joanna Pucula(Kate),Billy Zane(Mr. Fabian),Jason Priestly(Billy Breckinridge),Dana Wheeler-Nicholson(Mattie Earp),Terry O'Quinn(Mayor John Clum),John Corbett(Barnes),Pedro Armendariz Jr.(Priest)and Sly's younger brother Frank Stallone(Ed Bailey). The direction by George P. Cosmatos is excellent,with Cosmatos bringing an big,epic scope to the film and making the West look beautiful and glorious and wonderful shots of the sunlight and sky while Cosmatos also does a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Cosmatos. The score by Bruce Broughton is brilliant,epic,tragic and intense and matches the tone of the film and each scene. Great powerful score by Broughton. In final word,if you love Western films,Action films or films in general I highly suggest you see Tombstone,one of the best Westerns films of all time and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I am not a connoisseur of westerns but whenever this is on TV, I end up watching it again and again. It is the very best western I've ever seen. Val Kilmer is the real star of the film. He was not nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar. Neither was the movie nominated. Martin Landau was just OK in Ed Wood. Val Kilmer's every line in the movie is memorable and quotable." I'm your huckleberry." "Why Johnny Ringo, you look like someone just walked over your grave." " My hypocrisy knows no bound and so much more." His death scene brings tears to my eyes and is real acting. The Oscars no longer care about talent only marketing. I no longer pay attention to them anymore.

    Tombstone tells a tale that's been told over and over again, but manages to make it interesting. The good. Well done decor and costumes. Nice photography. Plenty of shootout. Interesting story. The actors. Kurt Russell did a credible job as Wyatt Earp, but it's probably the extent of his capabilities as you can see his limitations from time to time. Val Kilmer is absolutely excellent as his cultured, but edgy friend, Doc Holliday. Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton both give nice performances as his brothers. The bad. The river scene is of poor quality, Russell overdoing it by a fair margin, probably under the direction of the director. There are a few scenes where he's not at his best, but that one is the worst. The ugly. Nothing. The result. Excellent western action entertainment. Recommended to those who like the genre and the fans of Russell or Kilmer.

    I saw this one back-to-back with Kevin Costner's 'Wyatt Earp'(1994) movie and wow, what a difference in similarities. I will compare both films characters and interpretations , if applicable, and come to a conclusion at the end. Kurt Russell's Wyatt was not bad. I enjoyed it. This Earp story was more about like the title, about just that. Costner's was more how Wyatt Earp became the famous Earp from the beginning. So it's a tie as who did a better Wyatt Earp. Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday was a surprise. I felt he did a great job just as Dennis Quaid did with his. Very difficult on this also. I give it a tie also. Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp was right on casting. As this great actor personifies the ideal cowboy to me. Michael Madsen's interpretation was not bad but Elliott just nailed it. Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, also a great casting. I prefer Paxton's over Linden Ashby's. Even though Paxton's death scene was more Hollywood-ish and Ashby's more real and the Earp woman were more real in Costner's version. Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocius was a treat. Again Boothe wins over Lewis Smith's one. Boothe was sneaky, sinister and just slimy evil. Great casting even though he looked more ethnic per say. When I 1st saw him I really thought he was a Mexican bandido or something. lol Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo wins big time. Not only did Biehn do a phenomenal great job, the Ringo character was much more displayed and played a vital role here than Costner's one! The final showdown of Biehns Ringo with Kilmer's Holliday is classic! Charlton Heston as Henry Hooker was more like a glorified cameo and that's all. Still nice to see the late great Heston in a modern western regardless. Jason Priestley as Billy Breckinridge I felt was a OK but not enough screen time for this young actor so I feel he was wasted per say. Both these characters were not portrayed in the Costner version. Jon Tenney as Sheriff Johnny Behan was I believe a tie with Mark Harmon's. Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton was just great. A tie with Jeff Fahey's, who was also great. Thomas Haden Church as Billy Clanton was much better than Costner's version. Dana Delany as Josephine Marcus. was not bad but I gotta give it to Joanna Going's version. Both very beautiful actresses and they needed someone like that to interpret the Josephine role to make it believable that Wyatt would be mesmerized by this woman. Paula Malcomson as Allie Earp loses to the great Catherine O'Hara's version. Even the beautiful Dana Wheeler-Nicholson's Mattie Blaylock loses to Mare Winningham's version. Joanna Pacula's take on Big Nose Kate was way more believable than Isabella Rossellini's. But then again Isabella wasn't given much screen time and some of her scenes were cut, so who knows, had Isabella had more to do she could have given Pacula a run for her money. Michael Rooker as Sherman McMasters was not bad but short. Still it was way better than Todd Allen's in Costner's version. Billy Bob Thornton as Johnny Tyler was a nice treat. Paul Ben-Victor as Florentino was amusing. John Philbin as Tom McLaury was a nice bit. His was better than Adam Baldwin's one even though Baldwin's was more menacing as he stands 6'4" but Baldwin didn't have much to do in his version and Philbin has a nice bit confrontation scene with Russell's Wyatt. Robert John Burke as Frank McLaury was so-so. I prefer Rex Linn's one. Billy Zane as Mr. Fabian was nice bit. perfect casting for Zane. Even Boothe's Curly says, "this is the handsomest man I have ever seen"! lol Buck Taylor as Turkey Creek Jack Johnson was better than Costner's version. Terry O'Quinn as Mayor John Clum was not bad at all. I wonder how he would have done in the Behan role instead. Frank Stallone as Ed Bailey had a nice cameo bit. And Robert Mitchum as the Narrator was not inspired but nice to hear the recognizable Mitchum tone in there. In the end, both films are good but as far as interpretations goes I gotta give it to Tombstone. But as storyline goes , Costner's versions wins there.

Tombstone is an entertaining film and will not bore you if you like the actors enough and have certain appreciation of the classic, violent western. As a narrative it's pretty weak and rather forgettable, but the performances pretty much carry this film, at least for me.

    I personally feel it's difficult to break away from this Hollywood Pictures production, directed by George Cosmatos, with all the excitement found therein, as well as being filmed in a just-right location: namely the Old Tucson movie site. Kurt Russell played a mean-but-just Wyatt Earp. Sam Elliott was excellent as his brother Virgil. Bill Paxton portrayed Morgan Earp well. And you had no sympathy for the following people: Curly Bill Brocius (acted to a tee by Powers Boothe), Johnny Ringo (the mean man portrayed by Michael Biehn) and Ike Clanton (a fine turn by Stephen Lang.) John "Doc" Holiday was exactly like Val Kilmer, I'd say. Charlton Heston, though his role was rather small and his appearance in the movie was rather brief, did a great feat as Henry Hooker. Billy Zane, who was mean in "Titanic" showed that he could adapt to any role, playing the sissified stage actor he was. (He was definitely disgusting in places!) Robert Mitchum had a deep and clear voice, and he the narrator was also very articulate. And who wouldn't have fallen in love with Dana Delaney, the beautiful, charming lady who played the actress Josephine Marcus? She was virtually realistic as the lovely lady so good for Wyatt. And too, the experienced actor Harry Carey, Jr. was good in his brief role as the lawman he was. The gunfights were exciting, and not only the gunfight at the OK Corral. The only thing I didn't like about it were the bloody scenes. The dry, Old West was fitting, since the setting of the story was in Arizona. Again, it is one of the best western movies I've ever seen in all my years. Great!

    Tombstone is easily one of the greatest Western films of all time and an unforgettable classic that is filled with great direction,wonderful cast,fantastic Action,well-written screenplay and an amazing score and is not only one of my favorite Westerns of all time but one of my favorite films of all time. Set in Tombstone,Arizona in 1881,Tombstone tells the story of Wyatt Earp(Kurt Russell),a lawman who recently retired who along with his two brothers Virgil Earp(Sam Elliot)and Morgan Earp(Bill Paxton)and their wives decide to start a new life in Tombstone. But Wyatt's plans to settle down and retire are ruined when Wyatt and his brothers have to deal with an outlaw gang called The Cowboys who want the Earps blood. Now with the help of their friend Doc Holliday(Val Kilmer),the Earps and Doc look to destroy The Cowboys at all costs. In 1993 and 1994 there were two Western films made about Western legend Wyatt Earp George P. Cosmatos' Tombstone in 1993 and Lawrence Kadsen's Wyatt Earp which came out a year later. Where as Tombstone was an intense Action film about the events that took place before and after the Gunfight At The O.K Corral,Wyatt Earp was an epic biopic about the man Wyatt Earp and while Wyatt Earp is a good film in it's own right Tombstone is just a better and fully realized film. Tombstone is just an excellent film from beginning to end and is one of those films when you turn on Tombstone you just never turn it off and you are glued to the screen. There have been many films about Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday and The Gunfight At The O.K Corral but Tombstone is a film that stands out and is in a league of it's own because while Tombstone is based on real characters and historical events the movie is a thrill ride that has memorable characters and tension like a tightrope and never lets the viewer go until the end. What I also love about Tombstone and the Western genre in general is that TS brings into the world of the Old West and shows viewers how the West really was where Lawman enforced the laws and Outlaws broke them and blood was spilled into the dust and dirt. The Western atmosphere is accurate and very realistic and comes off the screen. The portrayals of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday are great and is some of the best depictions of Wyatt and Doc ever put on the screen. In Tombstone Wyatt Earp is depicted as some one who cares about his family and friends and doesn't want to get involved or participate with the violence and uncontrolled chaos that is happening in Tombstone but at the same time Wyatt is tough,heroic and takes crap from no one whether it's The Cowboys or strangers on the street. In Tombstone Doc Holliday is a character who gambles and uses his guns as well as smarts and charisma to get out situations and when he's in a conversation. Doc is a character you will love as soon as he comes on screen. I also loved the friendship between Wyatt and Doc because it feels real and truthful and when you watch the film you can tell that Wyatt and Doc really care about one another and that their friendship is honest. The film's screenplay by Kevin Jarre is great and well-written,with Jarre's script giving the main characters fantastic dialog and great,memorable scenes that will stay with the viewer after the film is over. The Action scenes in Tombstone are amazing and intense with wonderful Western gunfights and is done with great build up wonderful tension and white hot suspense especially The Gunfight At The O.K Correl scene. The build up to The Gunfight At The O.K Correl is unforgettable and when the classic Gunfight happens it explodes like a bomb and is done in a rapid fire quickness and you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. The Gunfight At The O.K Correl in this film is one of the best Action movie gunfights in film history and will be remembered forever. The ending of the film is wonderful and will leave you sad and happy and is a great cap off to Tombstone. The whole cast is wonderful. Kurt Russell is excellent and at his best as Wyatt Earp,with Russell bringing grit,toughness and depth to the role and is truly memorable. Val Kilmer gives a brilliant,unforgettable Oscar worthy iconic scene stealing performance as Doc Holliday,with Kilmer bringing coolness,charisma,great dialog and humor to the role. Kilmer's performance is masterful and will stick with you. Sam Elliot(Virgil Earp) and Bill Paxton(Morgan Earp)give great performances as Wyatt's brothers. Powers Booth(Curly Bill Brocius),Michael Biehn(Johnny Ringo)and Stephen Lang(Ike Clanton)give fantastic performances as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Dana Delany is great and beautiful as Josephine Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Jon Tenney is wonderful as Behan,a corrupt County Sheriff. Also,lookout for appearances from Charlton Heston(Henry Rooker),Michael Rooker(Sherman McMasters),Harry Carey Jr.(Marshel Fred White),Thomas Haden Church(Billy Clanton),Billy Bob Thorton(Johnny Tyler),Robert Burke(Frank McLaury),Joanna Pucula(Kate),Billy Zane(Mr. Fabian),Jason Priestly(Billy Breckinridge),Dana Wheeler-Nicholson(Mattie Earp),Terry O'Quinn(Mayor John Clum),John Corbett(Barnes),Pedro Armendariz Jr.(Priest)and Sly's younger brother Frank Stallone(Ed Bailey). The direction by George P. Cosmatos is excellent,with Cosmatos bringing an big,epic scope to the film and making the West look beautiful and glorious and wonderful shots of the sunlight and sky while Cosmatos also does a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Cosmatos. The score by Bruce Broughton is brilliant,epic,tragic and intense and matches the tone of the film and each scene. Great powerful score by Broughton. In final word,if you love Western films,Action films or films in general I highly suggest you see Tombstone,one of the best Westerns films of all time and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    I am not a connoisseur of westerns but whenever this is on TV, I end up watching it again and again. It is the very best western I've ever seen. Val Kilmer is the real star of the film. He was not nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar. Neither was the movie nominated. Martin Landau was just OK in Ed Wood. Val Kilmer's every line in the movie is memorable and quotable." I'm your huckleberry." "Why Johnny Ringo, you look like someone just walked over your grave." " My hypocrisy knows no bound and so much more." His death scene brings tears to my eyes and is real acting. The Oscars no longer care about talent only marketing. I no longer pay attention to them anymore.

    Tombstone tells a tale that's been told over and over again, but manages to make it interesting. The good. Well done decor and costumes. Nice photography. Plenty of shootout. Interesting story. The actors. Kurt Russell did a credible job as Wyatt Earp, but it's probably the extent of his capabilities as you can see his limitations from time to time. Val Kilmer is absolutely excellent as his cultured, but edgy friend, Doc Holliday. Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton both give nice performances as his brothers. The bad. The river scene is of poor quality, Russell overdoing it by a fair margin, probably under the direction of the director. There are a few scenes where he's not at his best, but that one is the worst. The ugly. Nothing. The result. Excellent western action entertainment. Recommended to those who like the genre and the fans of Russell or Kilmer.

    I saw this one back-to-back with Kevin Costner's 'Wyatt Earp'(1994) movie and wow, what a difference in similarities. I will compare both films characters and interpretations , if applicable, and come to a conclusion at the end. Kurt Russell's Wyatt was not bad. I enjoyed it. This Earp story was more about like the title, about just that. Costner's was more how Wyatt Earp became the famous Earp from the beginning. So it's a tie as who did a better Wyatt Earp. Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday was a surprise. I felt he did a great job just as Dennis Quaid did with his. Very difficult on this also. I give it a tie also. Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp was right on casting. As this great actor personifies the ideal cowboy to me. Michael Madsen's interpretation was not bad but Elliott just nailed it. Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, also a great casting. I prefer Paxton's over Linden Ashby's. Even though Paxton's death scene was more Hollywood-ish and Ashby's more real and the Earp woman were more real in Costner's version. Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocius was a treat. Again Boothe wins over Lewis Smith's one. Boothe was sneaky, sinister and just slimy evil. Great casting even though he looked more ethnic per say. When I 1st saw him I really thought he was a Mexican bandido or something. lol Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo wins big time. Not only did Biehn do a phenomenal great job, the Ringo character was much more displayed and played a vital role here than Costner's one! The final showdown of Biehns Ringo with Kilmer's Holliday is classic! Charlton Heston as Henry Hooker was more like a glorified cameo and that's all. Still nice to see the late great Heston in a modern western regardless. Jason Priestley as Billy Breckinridge I felt was a OK but not enough screen time for this young actor so I feel he was wasted per say. Both these characters were not portrayed in the Costner version. Jon Tenney as Sheriff Johnny Behan was I believe a tie with Mark Harmon's. Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton was just great. A tie with Jeff Fahey's, who was also great. Thomas Haden Church as Billy Clanton was much better than Costner's version. Dana Delany as Josephine Marcus. was not bad but I gotta give it to Joanna Going's version. Both very beautiful actresses and they needed someone like that to interpret the Josephine role to make it believable that Wyatt would be mesmerized by this woman. Paula Malcomson as Allie Earp loses to the great Catherine O'Hara's version. Even the beautiful Dana Wheeler-Nicholson's Mattie Blaylock loses to Mare Winningham's version. Joanna Pacula's take on Big Nose Kate was way more believable than Isabella Rossellini's. But then again Isabella wasn't given much screen time and some of her scenes were cut, so who knows, had Isabella had more to do she could have given Pacula a run for her money. Michael Rooker as Sherman McMasters was not bad but short. Still it was way better than Todd Allen's in Costner's version. Billy Bob Thornton as Johnny Tyler was a nice treat. Paul Ben-Victor as Florentino was amusing. John Philbin as Tom McLaury was a nice bit. His was better than Adam Baldwin's one even though Baldwin's was more menacing as he stands 6'4" but Baldwin didn't have much to do in his version and Philbin has a nice bit confrontation scene with Russell's Wyatt. Robert John Burke as Frank McLaury was so-so. I prefer Rex Linn's one. Billy Zane as Mr. Fabian was nice bit. perfect casting for Zane. Even Boothe's Curly says, "this is the handsomest man I have ever seen"! lol Buck Taylor as Turkey Creek Jack Johnson was better than Costner's version. Terry O'Quinn as Mayor John Clum was not bad at all. I wonder how he would have done in the Behan role instead. Frank Stallone as Ed Bailey had a nice cameo bit. And Robert Mitchum as the Narrator was not inspired but nice to hear the recognizable Mitchum tone in there. In the end, both films are good but as far as interpretations goes I gotta give it to Tombstone. But as storyline goes , Costner's versions wins there.

    I hate this movie. The makers of this dreck should be forced, like Alex in a Clockwork Orange, to watch "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" over and over and over again until they understand what a western should feel like. This is a Hollywood western, overacted, clich&eacute;, horse manure, the 90s equivalent of a Roy Rogers, all flair, with no depth or reality. Every line is this movie sounds like a catch phrase. Every shot in this movie looks like it belongs in a commercial or a music video. I suppose if you just want to be entertained, with brain left at home, then this crap might be for you. As for me, I'll take a dirty, gritty, Sergio Leone Clint Eastwood western any day.

    Tombstone is a "good looking movie"". That is one of the few reasons you should watch it. It is about 1% historically accurate. The story is absurd. The script is weak. The acting is poor. Val Kilmer is hysterically funny with his ridiculous "camped up" version of Doc Holliday. He should have won the razz in 1993 (he was robbed). Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp) tries too hard to be cool, and wearing his whiter than white shirts is highly amusing. I was not there, but I can assure you...the West was not like this...Tombstone was not a "cosmopolitan American Town". The story of Wyatt Earp, Tombstone, The O.K. corral, Etc. was nothing like this. Maybe this was made for young teenagers...Or maybe this is just a bad movie.

    If I were to list my all time favorite Westerns, Tombstone would definitely be at the top. I even love the director's cut that was release not to long ago that explained some missing pieces. Some critics have compared Tombstone with Wyatt Earp, which came out a year later. I believe this is an unfair comparison since Tombstone dealt with the events that happened in Tombstone, AZ and Wyatt Earp spanned more of Wyatt Earp's life before Tombstone, his life in Tombstone, and a little of his life after Tombstone. I love this movie because everything was made to look authentic. The facial hair was real, which is awesome... no fake hair on these guys faces. There is a scene with a thunderstorm that roles in and... it's real. One of my favorite scenes is when Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton), and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) first meet Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang), and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). In this scene Wyatt is dealing a faro game and he has just signed an autograph for a patron. Curly Bill grabs the autograph out of the man's hand and reads it. Ike jumps in and says that "law don't go round here." Wyatt informs him that he is retired. Johnny Ringo joins the conversation by looking at Doc Holliday and saying that he must be Doc Holliday. An exchange between the two ensues that could have gone wrong when Ringo draws his gun and begins spinning it. However, Doc uses a cup to diffuse the situation by spinning it in the same manner Ringo did. Another favorite scene is when Ike and Frank Stilwell (Thomas Arana) follow Wyatt and the rest of his family to Tucson to take Morgan's body to California. Ike and Frank are tasked to kill Wyatt and Virgil. Before they can complete their task Wyatt kills Frank. Wyatt walks up to a cowering Ike and takes his spur and cuts him at the corner of the mouth. Wyatt informs Ike that he is now a U.S. Marshall and that he is going to hunt down every Cowboy and kill them. The scene at the OK Corral is amazing. It is as close to what really happened as the film could get it without going back to October 26, 1881. I won't describe it because I wouldn't be able to do it justice and I want you to watch the movie if you haven't or again if you have. There are other scenes I liked as well. The movie itself is very good. This would have to be my absolute favorite Western movie of all time. I like this movie so much that I have remembered many of the various lines. Many of the lines Val Kilmer spoke as Doc Holliday are great, including, "I'm your Huckleberry". I give this 10 stars out of 10. I love this movie. I also recently read an article that told a story in which the original director was let go from this movie. A new director was hired and the production company whittled the script down significantly. Kurt Russell is also responsible for rallying the other actors and crew to finish the movie, said the same article.

    I don't watch movies to learn great things about history, I watch movies to be entertained. For me, the desire to watch a movie more than once is telling, and Tombstone is one of those movies that remains highly entertaining with repetitive viewings. The cast is perfect, Kurt Russell is a perfect Wyatt Earp, and Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holiday is nothing sort of amazing. How Kilmer was denied the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award is beyond my understanding. In my opinion, the very best American westerns include: (number 1) The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Unforgiven (along with most of Eastwood's other westerns) and now Tombstone should be added to that short list. If you watch movies to be entertained, as I do, even if you are not a Western fan, Tombstone is an entertaining classic. Watch it and you'll agree.

    Tombstone is a action packed western starring half of the Hollywood's character actors and action stars in film that slightly resembles a biopic of the legendary lawman Wyatt Earp. This film is a fun ride with good performances, great action, plenty of melodrama and mustaches. As a story, Tombstone is pretty uneven, the pacing is off after first hour, the editing leaves much to be desired, the villains are boring and one note, the plot starts and stops and starts all over again and the film is way too long. This film is one huge mess but thanks to the excellent performances by the cast, good action set pieces, great cinematography and the overpowering amount mustaches, the problems seem less important. There are three standout performances in this film - Kurt Russel, Sam Elliot and Val Kilmer. They pretty much carried the film on their own despite having some of the best supporting cast for film you can ever want. It's loaded with great character actors and Bill Zane to keep this very entertaining to watch. Also I really liked the how they handled the character of Doc Holliday. He was such a fascinating character and the performance by Val Kilmer was just right. They just should have made a film about him. Tombstone is an entertaining film and will not bore you if you like the actors enough and have certain appreciation of the classic, violent western. As a narrative it's pretty weak and rather forgettable, but the performances pretty much carry this film, at least for me.

He was not nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar. Neither was the movie nominated. Martin Landau was just OK in Ed Wood. Val Kilmer's every line in the movie is memorable and quotable." I'm your huckleberry." "Why Johnny Ringo, you look like someone just walked over your grave." " My hypocrisy knows no bound and so much more." His death scene brings tears to my eyes and is real acting. The Oscars no longer care about talent only marketing. I no longer pay attention to them anymore.

    Tombstone tells a tale that's been told over and over again, but manages to make it interesting. The good. Well done decor and costumes. Nice photography. Plenty of shootout. Interesting story. The actors. Kurt Russell did a credible job as Wyatt Earp, but it's probably the extent of his capabilities as you can see his limitations from time to time. Val Kilmer is absolutely excellent as his cultured, but edgy friend, Doc Holliday. Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton both give nice performances as his brothers. The bad. The river scene is of poor quality, Russell overdoing it by a fair margin, probably under the direction of the director. There are a few scenes where he's not at his best, but that one is the worst. The ugly. Nothing. The result. Excellent western action entertainment. Recommended to those who like the genre and the fans of Russell or Kilmer.

    I saw this one back-to-back with Kevin Costner's 'Wyatt Earp'(1994) movie and wow, what a difference in similarities. I will compare both films characters and interpretations , if applicable, and come to a conclusion at the end. Kurt Russell's Wyatt was not bad. I enjoyed it. This Earp story was more about like the title, about just that. Costner's was more how Wyatt Earp became the famous Earp from the beginning. So it's a tie as who did a better Wyatt Earp. Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday was a surprise. I felt he did a great job just as Dennis Quaid did with his. Very difficult on this also. I give it a tie also. Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp was right on casting. As this great actor personifies the ideal cowboy to me. Michael Madsen's interpretation was not bad but Elliott just nailed it. Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, also a great casting. I prefer Paxton's over Linden Ashby's. Even though Paxton's death scene was more Hollywood-ish and Ashby's more real and the Earp woman were more real in Costner's version. Powers Boothe as Curly Bill Brocius was a treat. Again Boothe wins over Lewis Smith's one. Boothe was sneaky, sinister and just slimy evil. Great casting even though he looked more ethnic per say. When I 1st saw him I really thought he was a Mexican bandido or something. lol Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo wins big time. Not only did Biehn do a phenomenal great job, the Ringo character was much more displayed and played a vital role here than Costner's one! The final showdown of Biehns Ringo with Kilmer's Holliday is classic! Charlton Heston as Henry Hooker was more like a glorified cameo and that's all. Still nice to see the late great Heston in a modern western regardless. Jason Priestley as Billy Breckinridge I felt was a OK but not enough screen time for this young actor so I feel he was wasted per say. Both these characters were not portrayed in the Costner version. Jon Tenney as Sheriff Johnny Behan was I believe a tie with Mark Harmon's. Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton was just great. A tie with Jeff Fahey's, who was also great. Thomas Haden Church as Billy Clanton was much better than Costner's version. Dana Delany as Josephine Marcus. was not bad but I gotta give it to Joanna Going's version. Both very beautiful actresses and they needed someone like that to interpret the Josephine role to make it believable that Wyatt would be mesmerized by this woman. Paula Malcomson as Allie Earp loses to the great Catherine O'Hara's version. Even the beautiful Dana Wheeler-Nicholson's Mattie Blaylock loses to Mare Winningham's version. Joanna Pacula's take on Big Nose Kate was way more believable than Isabella Rossellini's. But then again Isabella wasn't given much screen time and some of her scenes were cut, so who knows, had Isabella had more to do she could have given Pacula a run for her money. Michael Rooker as Sherman McMasters was not bad but short. Still it was way better than Todd Allen's in Costner's version. Billy Bob Thornton as Johnny Tyler was a nice treat. Paul Ben-Victor as Florentino was amusing. John Philbin as Tom McLaury was a nice bit. His was better than Adam Baldwin's one even though Baldwin's was more menacing as he stands 6'4" but Baldwin didn't have much to do in his version and Philbin has a nice bit confrontation scene with Russell's Wyatt. Robert John Burke as Frank McLaury was so-so. I prefer Rex Linn's one. Billy Zane as Mr. Fabian was nice bit. perfect casting for Zane. Even Boothe's Curly says, "this is the handsomest man I have ever seen"! lol Buck Taylor as Turkey Creek Jack Johnson was better than Costner's version. Terry O'Quinn as Mayor John Clum was not bad at all. I wonder how he would have done in the Behan role instead. Frank Stallone as Ed Bailey had a nice cameo bit. And Robert Mitchum as the Narrator was not inspired but nice to hear the recognizable Mitchum tone in there. In the end, both films are good but as far as interpretations goes I gotta give it to Tombstone. But as storyline goes , Costner's versions wins there.

    I hate this movie. The makers of this dreck should be forced, like Alex in a Clockwork Orange, to watch "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" over and over and over again until they understand what a western should feel like. This is a Hollywood western, overacted, clich&eacute;, horse manure, the 90s equivalent of a Roy Rogers, all flair, with no depth or reality. Every line is this movie sounds like a catch phrase. Every shot in this movie looks like it belongs in a commercial or a music video. I suppose if you just want to be entertained, with brain left at home, then this crap might be for you. As for me, I'll take a dirty, gritty, Sergio Leone Clint Eastwood western any day.

    Tombstone is a "good looking movie"". That is one of the few reasons you should watch it. It is about 1% historically accurate. The story is absurd. The script is weak. The acting is poor. Val Kilmer is hysterically funny with his ridiculous "camped up" version of Doc Holliday. He should have won the razz in 1993 (he was robbed). Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp) tries too hard to be cool, and wearing his whiter than white shirts is highly amusing. I was not there, but I can assure you...the West was not like this...Tombstone was not a "cosmopolitan American Town". The story of Wyatt Earp, Tombstone, The O.K. corral, Etc. was nothing like this. Maybe this was made for young teenagers...Or maybe this is just a bad movie.
