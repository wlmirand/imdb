    This is probably the breakthrough movie for Jackie Chan into the western Hollywood scene. It has just about all the crazy Jackie Chan stunt works in this, with those trademark silly and goofy moments. I can see why this movie was a hit when it first came out, it just has almost all the right Jackie Chan elements. It's short, but fun and exciting most of the way through. The plot is typical with no appearance by Maggie Cheung. Which doesn't really matter since, this movie is on target and knows which direction to head to for the most part. This movie just might have the biggest budget and the most crazy stunt work by Jackie Chan in this franchise as well. Maybe it's because the premise and setting of the movie doesn't only take place in China. Which might be one of the reason why this movie was able to reach wider audiences at the time. This one might not be the end of the "Police Story" saga but it's the end of this series story. Until the reboot that is. Overall this isn't just a good Jackie Chan movie but it's also a important film for Jackie Chan. It's worth checking out for sure, especially for the fans of Jackie Chan and his work. 8.4/10

    OK first, Jackie Chan stumbling around a Russian ski resort in a fluffy sea lion hat is priceless! An awful heck of a lot happens in the first 30 min alone. There were a lot of things I found a riot that were subtle and the slapstick variety. Like when Jackie is on a snowmobile at the ski resort and comes to a restricted area with a warning sign of one guy shooting another guy if you cross - he calls his superiors and asks what to do an the guy says, "Oh that's just for kids." So Jackie forges on. LMAO It's done do deadpan I'm not sure if it's intended to be funny, but I was roaring. The action keeps moving and there are some amazing moments like the famous ladder fight scene. The humor is great and well-placed and there's even a credible reason for Jackie to get naked at one point. His attempts to hide himself had me laughing out loud. This is one of those movies that you'll enjoy if you just let yourself enjoy it and not try to make sense of it. I found the story went in way too many directions to follow. But everything that goes on on screen is so much fun I kinda didn't care.

    This, the fourth of the Police Story films, sees Hong Kong police officer Insp. Chan Ka Kui travelling from Hong Kong to The Ukraine to Russia and finally to Australia in pursuit of stolen nuclear material. In the English dubbed version of the film that I saw this character has been renamed Jackie. During the course of the film he will have to fight with heavily armed men in the frozen mountains of The Ukraine, clamber around on the outside of a tall hotel while evading two Russian thugs, fight off a huge gang using a step ladder as a weapon and fight more Russians in an aquarium which also contains a deadly shark! He must also work out who he can trust as not everybody is quite what they seem. This film doesn't have quite as much action as the other films in the series that I've seen but what there was, was pretty good and it was clear that the budget was much higher as the action was far more explosive; involving the sort of skiing stunts and exploding helicopters one would expect in a Hollywood movie in fact if it wasn't for the rather obvious dubbing I might have thought it was a Hollywood movie. Jackie Chan does a great job in the lead role; providing the fantastic mix of action and comedy that fans have come to expect. The supporting cast were very much secondary to Jackie Chan but seemed to do a reasonably job; not hearing the actors actual voices does of course make it hard to judge them fairly. The plot may seem like something out of a Bond film but this is no rip off; you'd never see Bond shivering in the cold or wearing 'koala undies'! If you like comedy action this is well worth seeing and as there is little to offend it is probably suitable for younger viewers too.

    This is the one in which Jackie Chan performs miracles with a tall stepladder, and it's a sequence that quite frankly boggles the mind. Chan makes it look easy, but when you see the out-takes at the end of the film you'll see just how painful those stunts could be. He's a Bond-style super agent in this one - the fourth in a series apparently, although you won't need to have seen any of the previous films to follow this one. He's after a rogue agent in possession of a nuclear warhead or something, but the plot is secondary to the action so it doesn't really matter. The first twenty minutes or so provide an almost constant serving of action, and later on, as the pace slows a little, the humour kicks in, particularly as Chan and his foe suck their bleeding thumbs as they do battle in a tank occupied by a hungry shark

    This is the fourth installment of Jackie Chan's Police story series. The movie is separated into two parts. The first part is in Russia and the second part is in Australia. Jackie is after an ex-CIA agent Tsui who've stolen a nuclear bomb. Another group of terrorists are after the bomb too. Jackie gets between the terrorists and Tsui, and the terrorists tries to kill him too. Tsui's sister Annie and Jackie gets together, and tries to recover the case hidden in the aquarium. This movie was made during the period Jackie Chan was making movies in international locations. The story and the comedy is especially well done, perhaps it's because the screen play was written by four people. The fight sequences at the high rise hotel and the aquarium are one of Jackie's best. Good movie that will give you lots of laughs and action.

    I recognised the title and had seen the poster a few times, naturally starring one of the world's most famous martial artists I was interested to see it, no matter what rating the critics give it. Basically Insp. Jackie Chan Ka Kui (Jackie Chan) is the cop participating in some kind of sting operation on an international spy ring, he seems to be working for both the FBI and the Russians. One of the key spies, Jackson Tsui (Jackson Liu), manages to get away, and Jackie is the one ordered to catch and arrest him. What this leads to a is a journey across parts of the world, meeting up with the spy's sister Annie Tsui (Annie Chen Chun Wu) in Australia. Obviously along the way there are one or two fights where Jackie tries his best to fight back and stay alive, and in the end of course the case is solves after he has saved the day. Also starring Bill Tung as 'Uncle' Bill Wong, Yuri Petrov as Col. Gregor Yegorov, Nonna Grishaeva as Natasha, John Eaves as Mark and Terry Woo as Uncle Seven. Chan is obviously a good character, it is odd that he has to dub himself in a few scenes, many of the other actors are out of sync, the story is not the most engaging ever, in fact I lost track of what was going on, but there are some inventive fight sequences with Chan's cool stunt work, but apart from that I wouldn't really bother with this action thriller. Adequate!

    Part 4 of the Police Story series sees Jackie Chan's agile Hong Kong police inspector Chan Ka Kui become embroiled in James Bond-style international espionage after he is given the seemingly simple task of following beautiful suspect Natasha to Ukraine. When Natasha is abducted at the airport, Chan sets off in hot pursuit only to discover that she is involved with international arms dealers and the sale of a nuclear warhead. First Strike was made in the mid 90s, a transitional period for Jackie Chan, who was priming himself for his big move to the US. In order to broaden the star's appeal with the Western market, this one has a much more international flavour than many of his earlier films, with the action skipping round the globe, from Hong Kong to Ukraine to Russia and, finally, to Australia. The film is also less focused on pure martial arts mayhem, with more in the way of straight forward Hollywood style stunt-filled action, but when the kung fu does happen it is extremely well handled, with Jackie displaying his usual athleticism, impeccable timing, and flair for physical comedy. The rather messy plot and occasionally slow pacing prevents First Strike from being a bona fide Chan classic, but there is still plenty of inventive stuff to make this one a whole lot of fun, best bits being a wonderful fight scene in which Chan uses a stepladder as a weapon, an exhilarating ski chase down a mountain, some underwater shenanigans with sharks, and a scrap with two Russian man-mountains that involves Chan making a vertiginous leap onto a narrow ledge of a high-rise building.

    FIRST STRIKE packs a violent confrontation between Jackie and double agents from CIA and KGB . This exciting story about the cop named Chang Wing of the Hong Kong precinct is well played by Jackie Chan. Chang participates in a sting operation against an international spy-ring that is smuggling nuclear weapons from Ukraine. But when one of them (Tsui) escapes , Jackie is ordered to capture him . This leads Jackie all over the globe beginning with Tsui's sister (Annie Wu) at Australia . The story follows him as he attempts to stay alive and chase the villain. When his police buddies are deceived by a wicked criminal band , Wing turns into an unfortunate spy when he is also double-crossed . A young woman helps him to track down and apprehend the gang commanded by a double agent. Then Chan looks for vengeance against the ominous villains at a cat and mouse game. This exciting movie is crammed of action-packed, overwhelming stunt-work and lots of violence but with humor. Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous criminals and as always he makes his own stunts like is showed on the final fake-shots . Awesome ,incredible stunts and brief comic touches , as usual ; the picture is better constructed than its predecessor . The lighting-paced storyline slows down at times , but frantic action sequences make up for it . Spotlights movie include a stirring pursuit on the snow and underwater fights surrounded by sharks in James Bond style , among others . This is a phenomenal action movie distinguished by nicely cinematography of the spectacular sequences , and contains agreeable sense of humor such as previous entries . However while the former outings Jackie teamed up to prestigious actresses and fine action stars in their own right , like Maggie Cheung and Michelle Khan , at this film his parternaire is unknown . Thrilling and moving musical score fitting to action by J. Peter Robinson . The picture is lavishly produced by the great Asian producers Raymond Chow and Golden Harvest production and efficiently directed by Stanley Tong . The first version titled &uml;Police story(1985)&uml; directed by the same Jackie Chan was a perfect action film for enthusiastic of the genre ; the following was &uml;Police story 2(1988)&uml; also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches . It's followed by &uml;Police story V : Crime story&uml; and finally &uml;New Police story&uml; by Benny Chan . Rating : Accepatable and passable, the picture has its sensational moments here and there , mostly provided by its agile star, the super Jackie Chan .

    Originally called Police Story 4:First Strike, Jackie Chan made this in 1996 and is the last of the original Police Story films in which he plays his Police Story character, Chan-Kai Ku. Chan's next Police Story film, New Police Story, would be a new generation film to the series and released in 2004. As we all know Jackie Chan is probably the best martial arts actor on screen next to Bruce Lee. Chan took fighting sequences as we know it and made them so much more entertaining. Including prop fights and fights in so many cool places. An example of cool creative Chan fight scene would be in this one where Jackie battles Russian Maufia henchmen UNDER WATER ! With sharks !! Later in the review I will clarify on the US cuts of Jackie's films. Chan-Kai Ku returns again, and this time he's not battling gangs in Hong Kong or its surrounding areas, he's now an international agent trying to stop the illegal selling of uranium bombs. This could lead to the end of the world as we know it. At first Chan is supposed to just keep track of a girl on a plane, but then he ends up getting caught up with the Russian Maufia who later betrays him. As the plot unravels more and more, impressive action sequences do surface such as a snow mobile and helicopter chase (cut from the US version), a prop fight with ladders,brooms, and sticks, and to a climatic under water fight ! Wow ! I have to admit, this film is more of a drama than martial arts film, therefore is quite different from the previous Police Story films. The US version is by no means worth getting after seeing the uncut version. Even though New Line Cinema's DVD of this is only $5, after viewing the uncut (which only surfaced on the Japanese laser disc,VCD disc,DVD, and the Taiwanese DVD as well.) you will realize you've never been swindled out of $5 so bad in your entire life time. The US cuts: Jackie Chan first gained stardom with his first big film in Asia, The Drunken Master (1978). Chan then went onto gain even more international stardom with Police Story (1985). Chan had made a bunch of films in the US, but never made it famous here until his 1995 film, Rumble in The Bronx. I hate it when this happens, America acts like they've discovered something big and great and they're the first ones who knew about it. Joke's on them ! Jackie had already been famous for over 20 years before his big LATE US debut. This is also when the popular rumor of Chan doing every single one of his stunts began. Its a lie people, not a fact. Jackie DOES MOST OF HIS OWN STUNTS.....not all. Anyways, New Line Cinema in the mid-90s seemed to be the US film company that bought most of Jackie's films (Dimension owned and released a few, but nowhere near as much as New Line), such as Police Story 1 & 2, and was the distributor to the US for Chan's most recent films. It seems as if New Line Cinema's editors are very underpaid, so they practically chopped up and edited so much up of Jackie's movies its unbearable. One common practice is adding a main title sequence. In most Hong Kong films there really is no opening credits, but just the film's title and the main star along with the director etc. But here a whole title sequence is made, as well as changing the film's score. These are New Line's attempts at Americanizing Chan's movies. But, isn't that the whole point of foreign films ? To watch them as they are ?! Plus, watching New Line's disgraceful edits is an insult to the film makers since they've worked so hard on this project and then stuff gets changed and torn out, so you're not watching it the way it was intended. Some of New Line's biggest edits are on First Strike, Mr. Nice Guy, and Rumble in The Bronx ! Mr. Nice Guy for example was released here in US theatres in its original uncut 113 minute length, but when New Line released the DVD they CHOPPED IT DOWN TO ONLY 84 MINUTES ! Woah !!! These companies have so much control, that they actually have had the US edits have world wide distribution ! So now the uncut dvds are virtually impossible to find !!!! Even in Asia the cut US dvds are the most popular to find ! ASS !!! Another thing is the dubbing. New Line's dubbing is done way better than Dimension's dubbing. In First Strike its very interesting. The film was originally shot with a bunch of languages since, Chan is an international agent in this one. I mean that, Jackie Chan speaks English, Cantonese and Mandarin throughout the movie, while the Russians of course speak Russian as well as English. But in the US version everyone speaks English. So in the part where the Russian agent and the Chinese agent talking through their computers makes more sense, since the Chinese guy can't speak Russian, and the Russians can't speak Chinese. The US version you'll find yourself confused. 'well, if they both speak English why can't they just talk to each other ?' Another strange dubbing detail I noticed was that some of the characters who speak English in the movie are re-dubbed anyways to maybe hide their accents. In some cases very bad Russian stereotype voices. Hey, New Line ! I have an idea, for Jackie's next movie why not just make it run only an hour and make Jackie look like a white guy so he appeals more to stupid Americans!! ! Maybe that's better !

    jackie chan's first strike is your typical jackie chan fare featuring all the brilliant fight scenes and breathetaking stunts one expects from the chanster. a big improvement over supercop while not as good as jackie chan's who am i, never the less this is perfect entertainment from start to finish as jackie chan is hired by the c.i.a and gets tangled in some dangereous stuff and people are not to be trusted, but hey jackie chan movies are rarely there for story lines, the storyline is just the excuse to have some great fight scenes and stunts and here first strike delivers. i am one of the biggest jackie chan fans in the uk i think anyway and have seen all his films, and even though first strike isn't one of his best it's a solid effort none the less.

    Part 4 of the Police Story series sees Jackie Chan's agile Hong Kong police inspector Chan Ka Kui become embroiled in James Bond-style international espionage after he is given the seemingly simple task of following beautiful suspect Natasha to Ukraine. When Natasha is abducted at the airport, Chan sets off in hot pursuit only to discover that she is involved with international arms dealers and the sale of a nuclear warhead. First Strike was made in the mid 90s, a transitional period for Jackie Chan, who was priming himself for his big move to the US. In order to broaden the star's appeal with the Western market, this one has a much more international flavour than many of his earlier films, with the action skipping round the globe, from Hong Kong to Ukraine to Russia and, finally, to Australia.

The rather messy plot and occasionally slow pacing prevents First Strike from being a bona fide Chan classic, but there is still plenty of inventive stuff to make this one a whole lot of fun, best bits being a wonderful fight scene in which Chan uses a stepladder as a weapon, an exhilarating ski chase down a mountain, some underwater shenanigans with sharks, and a scrap with two Russian man-mountains that involves Chan making a vertiginous leap onto a narrow ledge of a high-rise building.

    FIRST STRIKE packs a violent confrontation between Jackie and double agents from CIA and KGB . This exciting story about the cop named Chang Wing of the Hong Kong precinct is well played by Jackie Chan. Chang participates in a sting operation against an international spy-ring that is smuggling nuclear weapons from Ukraine. But when one of them (Tsui) escapes , Jackie is ordered to capture him . This leads Jackie all over the globe beginning with Tsui's sister (Annie Wu) at Australia . The story follows him as he attempts to stay alive and chase the villain. When his police buddies are deceived by a wicked criminal band , Wing turns into an unfortunate spy when he is also double-crossed . A young woman helps him to track down and apprehend the gang commanded by a double agent. Then Chan looks for vengeance against the ominous villains at a cat and mouse game. This exciting movie is crammed of action-packed, overwhelming stunt-work and lots of violence but with humor. Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous criminals and as always he makes his own stunts like is showed on the final fake-shots . Awesome ,incredible stunts and brief comic touches , as usual ; the picture is better constructed than its predecessor . The lighting-paced storyline slows down at times , but frantic action sequences make up for it . Spotlights movie include a stirring pursuit on the snow and underwater fights surrounded by sharks in James Bond style , among others . This is a phenomenal action movie distinguished by nicely cinematography of the spectacular sequences , and contains agreeable sense of humor such as previous entries . However while the former outings Jackie teamed up to prestigious actresses and fine action stars in their own right , like Maggie Cheung and Michelle Khan , at this film his parternaire is unknown . Thrilling and moving musical score fitting to action by J. Peter Robinson . The picture is lavishly produced by the great Asian producers Raymond Chow and Golden Harvest production and efficiently directed by Stanley Tong . The first version titled &uml;Police story(1985)&uml; directed by the same Jackie Chan was a perfect action film for enthusiastic of the genre ; the following was &uml;Police story 2(1988)&uml; also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches . It's followed by &uml;Police story V : Crime story&uml; and finally &uml;New Police story&uml; by Benny Chan . Rating : Accepatable and passable, the picture has its sensational moments here and there , mostly provided by its agile star, the super Jackie Chan .

    Originally called Police Story 4:First Strike, Jackie Chan made this in 1996 and is the last of the original Police Story films in which he plays his Police Story character, Chan-Kai Ku. Chan's next Police Story film, New Police Story, would be a new generation film to the series and released in 2004. As we all know Jackie Chan is probably the best martial arts actor on screen next to Bruce Lee. Chan took fighting sequences as we know it and made them so much more entertaining. Including prop fights and fights in so many cool places. An example of cool creative Chan fight scene would be in this one where Jackie battles Russian Maufia henchmen UNDER WATER ! With sharks !! Later in the review I will clarify on the US cuts of Jackie's films. Chan-Kai Ku returns again, and this time he's not battling gangs in Hong Kong or its surrounding areas, he's now an international agent trying to stop the illegal selling of uranium bombs. This could lead to the end of the world as we know it. At first Chan is supposed to just keep track of a girl on a plane, but then he ends up getting caught up with the Russian Maufia who later betrays him. As the plot unravels more and more, impressive action sequences do surface such as a snow mobile and helicopter chase (cut from the US version), a prop fight with ladders,brooms, and sticks, and to a climatic under water fight ! Wow ! I have to admit, this film is more of a drama than martial arts film, therefore is quite different from the previous Police Story films. The US version is by no means worth getting after seeing the uncut version. Even though New Line Cinema's DVD of this is only $5, after viewing the uncut (which only surfaced on the Japanese laser disc,VCD disc,DVD, and the Taiwanese DVD as well.) you will realize you've never been swindled out of $5 so bad in your entire life time. The US cuts: Jackie Chan first gained stardom with his first big film in Asia, The Drunken Master (1978). Chan then went onto gain even more international stardom with Police Story (1985). Chan had made a bunch of films in the US, but never made it famous here until his 1995 film, Rumble in The Bronx. I hate it when this happens, America acts like they've discovered something big and great and they're the first ones who knew about it. Joke's on them ! Jackie had already been famous for over 20 years before his big LATE US debut. This is also when the popular rumor of Chan doing every single one of his stunts began. Its a lie people, not a fact. Jackie DOES MOST OF HIS OWN STUNTS.....not all. Anyways, New Line Cinema in the mid-90s seemed to be the US film company that bought most of Jackie's films (Dimension owned and released a few, but nowhere near as much as New Line), such as Police Story 1 & 2, and was the distributor to the US for Chan's most recent films. It seems as if New Line Cinema's editors are very underpaid, so they practically chopped up and edited so much up of Jackie's movies its unbearable. One common practice is adding a main title sequence. In most Hong Kong films there really is no opening credits, but just the film's title and the main star along with the director etc. But here a whole title sequence is made, as well as changing the film's score. These are New Line's attempts at Americanizing Chan's movies. But, isn't that the whole point of foreign films ? To watch them as they are ?! Plus, watching New Line's disgraceful edits is an insult to the film makers since they've worked so hard on this project and then stuff gets changed and torn out, so you're not watching it the way it was intended. Some of New Line's biggest edits are on First Strike, Mr. Nice Guy, and Rumble in The Bronx ! Mr. Nice Guy for example was released here in US theatres in its original uncut 113 minute length, but when New Line released the DVD they CHOPPED IT DOWN TO ONLY 84 MINUTES ! Woah !!! These companies have so much control, that they actually have had the US edits have world wide distribution ! So now the uncut dvds are virtually impossible to find !!!! Even in Asia the cut US dvds are the most popular to find ! ASS !!! Another thing is the dubbing. New Line's dubbing is done way better than Dimension's dubbing. In First Strike its very interesting. The film was originally shot with a bunch of languages since, Chan is an international agent in this one. I mean that, Jackie Chan speaks English, Cantonese and Mandarin throughout the movie, while the Russians of course speak Russian as well as English. But in the US version everyone speaks English. So in the part where the Russian agent and the Chinese agent talking through their computers makes more sense, since the Chinese guy can't speak Russian, and the Russians can't speak Chinese. The US version you'll find yourself confused. 'well, if they both speak English why can't they just talk to each other ?' Another strange dubbing detail I noticed was that some of the characters who speak English in the movie are re-dubbed anyways to maybe hide their accents. In some cases very bad Russian stereotype voices. Hey, New Line ! I have an idea, for Jackie's next movie why not just make it run only an hour and make Jackie look like a white guy so he appeals more to stupid Americans!! ! Maybe that's better !

    jackie chan's first strike is your typical jackie chan fare featuring all the brilliant fight scenes and breathetaking stunts one expects from the chanster. a big improvement over supercop while not as good as jackie chan's who am i, never the less this is perfect entertainment from start to finish as jackie chan is hired by the c.i.a and gets tangled in some dangereous stuff and people are not to be trusted, but hey jackie chan movies are rarely there for story lines, the storyline is just the excuse to have some great fight scenes and stunts and here first strike delivers. i am one of the biggest jackie chan fans in the uk i think anyway and have seen all his films, and even though first strike isn't one of his best it's a solid effort none the less.

    This is probably the breakthrough movie for Jackie Chan into the western Hollywood scene. It has just about all the crazy Jackie Chan stunt works in this, with those trademark silly and goofy moments. I can see why this movie was a hit when it first came out, it just has almost all the right Jackie Chan elements. It's short, but fun and exciting most of the way through. The plot is typical with no appearance by Maggie Cheung. Which doesn't really matter since, this movie is on target and knows which direction to head to for the most part. This movie just might have the biggest budget and the most crazy stunt work by Jackie Chan in this franchise as well. Maybe it's because the premise and setting of the movie doesn't only take place in China. Which might be one of the reason why this movie was able to reach wider audiences at the time. This one might not be the end of the "Police Story" saga but it's the end of this series story. Until the reboot that is. Overall this isn't just a good Jackie Chan movie but it's also a important film for Jackie Chan. It's worth checking out for sure, especially for the fans of Jackie Chan and his work. 8.4/10

    OK first, Jackie Chan stumbling around a Russian ski resort in a fluffy sea lion hat is priceless! An awful heck of a lot happens in the first 30 min alone. There were a lot of things I found a riot that were subtle and the slapstick variety. Like when Jackie is on a snowmobile at the ski resort and comes to a restricted area with a warning sign of one guy shooting another guy if you cross - he calls his superiors and asks what to do an the guy says, "Oh that's just for kids." So Jackie forges on. LMAO It's done do deadpan I'm not sure if it's intended to be funny, but I was roaring. The action keeps moving and there are some amazing moments like the famous ladder fight scene. The humor is great and well-placed and there's even a credible reason for Jackie to get naked at one point. His attempts to hide himself had me laughing out loud. This is one of those movies that you'll enjoy if you just let yourself enjoy it and not try to make sense of it. I found the story went in way too many directions to follow. But everything that goes on on screen is so much fun I kinda didn't care.

    This, the fourth of the Police Story films, sees Hong Kong police officer Insp. Chan Ka Kui travelling from Hong Kong to The Ukraine to Russia and finally to Australia in pursuit of stolen nuclear material. In the English dubbed version of the film that I saw this character has been renamed Jackie. During the course of the film he will have to fight with heavily armed men in the frozen mountains of The Ukraine, clamber around on the outside of a tall hotel while evading two Russian thugs, fight off a huge gang using a step ladder as a weapon and fight more Russians in an aquarium which also contains a deadly shark! He must also work out who he can trust as not everybody is quite what they seem. This film doesn't have quite as much action as the other films in the series that I've seen but what there was, was pretty good and it was clear that the budget was much higher as the action was far more explosive; involving the sort of skiing stunts and exploding helicopters one would expect in a Hollywood movie in fact if it wasn't for the rather obvious dubbing I might have thought it was a Hollywood movie. Jackie Chan does a great job in the lead role; providing the fantastic mix of action and comedy that fans have come to expect. The supporting cast were very much secondary to Jackie Chan but seemed to do a reasonably job; not hearing the actors actual voices does of course make it hard to judge them fairly. The plot may seem like something out of a Bond film but this is no rip off; you'd never see Bond shivering in the cold or wearing 'koala undies'! If you like comedy action this is well worth seeing and as there is little to offend it is probably suitable for younger viewers too.

    This is the one in which Jackie Chan performs miracles with a tall stepladder, and it's a sequence that quite frankly boggles the mind. Chan makes it look easy, but when you see the out-takes at the end of the film you'll see just how painful those stunts could be. He's a Bond-style super agent in this one - the fourth in a series apparently, although you won't need to have seen any of the previous films to follow this one. He's after a rogue agent in possession of a nuclear warhead or something, but the plot is secondary to the action so it doesn't really matter. The first twenty minutes or so provide an almost constant serving of action, and later on, as the pace slows a little, the humour kicks in, particularly as Chan and his foe suck their bleeding thumbs as they do battle in a tank occupied by a hungry shark

    This is the fourth installment of Jackie Chan's Police story series. The movie is separated into two parts. The first part is in Russia and the second part is in Australia. Jackie is after an ex-CIA agent Tsui who've stolen a nuclear bomb. Another group of terrorists are after the bomb too. Jackie gets between the terrorists and Tsui, and the terrorists tries to kill him too. Tsui's sister Annie and Jackie gets together, and tries to recover the case hidden in the aquarium. This movie was made during the period Jackie Chan was making movies in international locations. The story and the comedy is especially well done, perhaps it's because the screen play was written by four people. The fight sequences at the high rise hotel and the aquarium are one of Jackie's best. Good movie that will give you lots of laughs and action.

    I recognised the title and had seen the poster a few times, naturally starring one of the world's most famous martial artists I was interested to see it, no matter what rating the critics give it. Basically Insp. Jackie Chan Ka Kui (Jackie Chan) is the cop participating in some kind of sting operation on an international spy ring, he seems to be working for both the FBI and the Russians. One of the key spies, Jackson Tsui (Jackson Liu), manages to get away, and Jackie is the one ordered to catch and arrest him. What this leads to a is a journey across parts of the world, meeting up with the spy's sister Annie Tsui (Annie Chen Chun Wu) in Australia. Obviously along the way there are one or two fights where Jackie tries his best to fight back and stay alive, and in the end of course the case is solves after he has saved the day. Also starring Bill Tung as 'Uncle' Bill Wong, Yuri Petrov as Col. Gregor Yegorov, Nonna Grishaeva as Natasha, John Eaves as Mark and Terry Woo as Uncle Seven. Chan is obviously a good character, it is odd that he has to dub himself in a few scenes, many of the other actors are out of sync, the story is not the most engaging ever, in fact I lost track of what was going on, but there are some inventive fight sequences with Chan's cool stunt work, but apart from that I wouldn't really bother with this action thriller. Adequate!

    Part 4 of the Police Story series sees Jackie Chan's agile Hong Kong police inspector Chan Ka Kui become embroiled in James Bond-style international espionage after he is given the seemingly simple task of following beautiful suspect Natasha to Ukraine. When Natasha is abducted at the airport, Chan sets off in hot pursuit only to discover that she is involved with international arms dealers and the sale of a nuclear warhead. First Strike was made in the mid 90s, a transitional period for Jackie Chan, who was priming himself for his big move to the US. In order to broaden the star's appeal with the Western market, this one has a much more international flavour than many of his earlier films, with the action skipping round the globe, from Hong Kong to Ukraine to Russia and, finally, to Australia. The film is also less focused on pure martial arts mayhem, with more in the way of straight forward Hollywood style stunt-filled action, but when the kung fu does happen it is extremely well handled, with Jackie displaying his usual athleticism, impeccable timing, and flair for physical comedy.

The action keeps moving and there are some amazing moments like the famous ladder fight scene. The humor is great and well-placed and there's even a credible reason for Jackie to get naked at one point. His attempts to hide himself had me laughing out loud. This is one of those movies that you'll enjoy if you just let yourself enjoy it and not try to make sense of it. I found the story went in way too many directions to follow. But everything that goes on on screen is so much fun I kinda didn't care.

    This, the fourth of the Police Story films, sees Hong Kong police officer Insp. Chan Ka Kui travelling from Hong Kong to The Ukraine to Russia and finally to Australia in pursuit of stolen nuclear material. In the English dubbed version of the film that I saw this character has been renamed Jackie. During the course of the film he will have to fight with heavily armed men in the frozen mountains of The Ukraine, clamber around on the outside of a tall hotel while evading two Russian thugs, fight off a huge gang using a step ladder as a weapon and fight more Russians in an aquarium which also contains a deadly shark! He must also work out who he can trust as not everybody is quite what they seem. This film doesn't have quite as much action as the other films in the series that I've seen but what there was, was pretty good and it was clear that the budget was much higher as the action was far more explosive; involving the sort of skiing stunts and exploding helicopters one would expect in a Hollywood movie in fact if it wasn't for the rather obvious dubbing I might have thought it was a Hollywood movie. Jackie Chan does a great job in the lead role; providing the fantastic mix of action and comedy that fans have come to expect. The supporting cast were very much secondary to Jackie Chan but seemed to do a reasonably job; not hearing the actors actual voices does of course make it hard to judge them fairly. The plot may seem like something out of a Bond film but this is no rip off; you'd never see Bond shivering in the cold or wearing 'koala undies'! If you like comedy action this is well worth seeing and as there is little to offend it is probably suitable for younger viewers too.

    This is the one in which Jackie Chan performs miracles with a tall stepladder, and it's a sequence that quite frankly boggles the mind. Chan makes it look easy, but when you see the out-takes at the end of the film you'll see just how painful those stunts could be. He's a Bond-style super agent in this one - the fourth in a series apparently, although you won't need to have seen any of the previous films to follow this one. He's after a rogue agent in possession of a nuclear warhead or something, but the plot is secondary to the action so it doesn't really matter. The first twenty minutes or so provide an almost constant serving of action, and later on, as the pace slows a little, the humour kicks in, particularly as Chan and his foe suck their bleeding thumbs as they do battle in a tank occupied by a hungry shark

    This is the fourth installment of Jackie Chan's Police story series. The movie is separated into two parts. The first part is in Russia and the second part is in Australia. Jackie is after an ex-CIA agent Tsui who've stolen a nuclear bomb. Another group of terrorists are after the bomb too. Jackie gets between the terrorists and Tsui, and the terrorists tries to kill him too. Tsui's sister Annie and Jackie gets together, and tries to recover the case hidden in the aquarium. This movie was made during the period Jackie Chan was making movies in international locations. The story and the comedy is especially well done, perhaps it's because the screen play was written by four people. The fight sequences at the high rise hotel and the aquarium are one of Jackie's best. Good movie that will give you lots of laughs and action.

    I recognised the title and had seen the poster a few times, naturally starring one of the world's most famous martial artists I was interested to see it, no matter what rating the critics give it. Basically Insp. Jackie Chan Ka Kui (Jackie Chan) is the cop participating in some kind of sting operation on an international spy ring, he seems to be working for both the FBI and the Russians. One of the key spies, Jackson Tsui (Jackson Liu), manages to get away, and Jackie is the one ordered to catch and arrest him. What this leads to a is a journey across parts of the world, meeting up with the spy's sister Annie Tsui (Annie Chen Chun Wu) in Australia. Obviously along the way there are one or two fights where Jackie tries his best to fight back and stay alive, and in the end of course the case is solves after he has saved the day. Also starring Bill Tung as 'Uncle' Bill Wong, Yuri Petrov as Col. Gregor Yegorov, Nonna Grishaeva as Natasha, John Eaves as Mark and Terry Woo as Uncle Seven. Chan is obviously a good character, it is odd that he has to dub himself in a few scenes, many of the other actors are out of sync, the story is not the most engaging ever, in fact I lost track of what was going on, but there are some inventive fight sequences with Chan's cool stunt work, but apart from that I wouldn't really bother with this action thriller. Adequate!

    Part 4 of the Police Story series sees Jackie Chan's agile Hong Kong police inspector Chan Ka Kui become embroiled in James Bond-style international espionage after he is given the seemingly simple task of following beautiful suspect Natasha to Ukraine. When Natasha is abducted at the airport, Chan sets off in hot pursuit only to discover that she is involved with international arms dealers and the sale of a nuclear warhead. First Strike was made in the mid 90s, a transitional period for Jackie Chan, who was priming himself for his big move to the US. In order to broaden the star's appeal with the Western market, this one has a much more international flavour than many of his earlier films, with the action skipping round the globe, from Hong Kong to Ukraine to Russia and, finally, to Australia. The film is also less focused on pure martial arts mayhem, with more in the way of straight forward Hollywood style stunt-filled action, but when the kung fu does happen it is extremely well handled, with Jackie displaying his usual athleticism, impeccable timing, and flair for physical comedy. The rather messy plot and occasionally slow pacing prevents First Strike from being a bona fide Chan classic, but there is still plenty of inventive stuff to make this one a whole lot of fun, best bits being a wonderful fight scene in which Chan uses a stepladder as a weapon, an exhilarating ski chase down a mountain, some underwater shenanigans with sharks, and a scrap with two Russian man-mountains that involves Chan making a vertiginous leap onto a narrow ledge of a high-rise building.

    FIRST STRIKE packs a violent confrontation between Jackie and double agents from CIA and KGB . This exciting story about the cop named Chang Wing of the Hong Kong precinct is well played by Jackie Chan. Chang participates in a sting operation against an international spy-ring that is smuggling nuclear weapons from Ukraine. But when one of them (Tsui) escapes , Jackie is ordered to capture him . This leads Jackie all over the globe beginning with Tsui's sister (Annie Wu) at Australia . The story follows him as he attempts to stay alive and chase the villain. When his police buddies are deceived by a wicked criminal band , Wing turns into an unfortunate spy when he is also double-crossed . A young woman helps him to track down and apprehend the gang commanded by a double agent. Then Chan looks for vengeance against the ominous villains at a cat and mouse game. This exciting movie is crammed of action-packed, overwhelming stunt-work and lots of violence but with humor. Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous criminals and as always he makes his own stunts like is showed on the final fake-shots . Awesome ,incredible stunts and brief comic touches , as usual ; the picture is better constructed than its predecessor . The lighting-paced storyline slows down at times , but frantic action sequences make up for it . Spotlights movie include a stirring pursuit on the snow and underwater fights surrounded by sharks in James Bond style , among others . This is a phenomenal action movie distinguished by nicely cinematography of the spectacular sequences , and contains agreeable sense of humor such as previous entries . However while the former outings Jackie teamed up to prestigious actresses and fine action stars in their own right , like Maggie Cheung and Michelle Khan , at this film his parternaire is unknown . Thrilling and moving musical score fitting to action by J. Peter Robinson . The picture is lavishly produced by the great Asian producers Raymond Chow and Golden Harvest production and efficiently directed by Stanley Tong . The first version titled &uml;Police story(1985)&uml; directed by the same Jackie Chan was a perfect action film for enthusiastic of the genre ; the following was &uml;Police story 2(1988)&uml; also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches . It's followed by &uml;Police story V : Crime story&uml; and finally &uml;New Police story&uml; by Benny Chan . Rating : Accepatable and passable, the picture has its sensational moments here and there , mostly provided by its agile star, the super Jackie Chan .

    Originally called Police Story 4:First Strike, Jackie Chan made this in 1996 and is the last of the original Police Story films in which he plays his Police Story character, Chan-Kai Ku. Chan's next Police Story film, New Police Story, would be a new generation film to the series and released in 2004. As we all know Jackie Chan is probably the best martial arts actor on screen next to Bruce Lee. Chan took fighting sequences as we know it and made them so much more entertaining. Including prop fights and fights in so many cool places. An example of cool creative Chan fight scene would be in this one where Jackie battles Russian Maufia henchmen UNDER WATER ! With sharks !! Later in the review I will clarify on the US cuts of Jackie's films. Chan-Kai Ku returns again, and this time he's not battling gangs in Hong Kong or its surrounding areas, he's now an international agent trying to stop the illegal selling of uranium bombs. This could lead to the end of the world as we know it. At first Chan is supposed to just keep track of a girl on a plane, but then he ends up getting caught up with the Russian Maufia who later betrays him. As the plot unravels more and more, impressive action sequences do surface such as a snow mobile and helicopter chase (cut from the US version), a prop fight with ladders,brooms, and sticks, and to a climatic under water fight ! Wow ! I have to admit, this film is more of a drama than martial arts film, therefore is quite different from the previous Police Story films. The US version is by no means worth getting after seeing the uncut version. Even though New Line Cinema's DVD of this is only $5, after viewing the uncut (which only surfaced on the Japanese laser disc,VCD disc,DVD, and the Taiwanese DVD as well.) you will realize you've never been swindled out of $5 so bad in your entire life time. The US cuts: Jackie Chan first gained stardom with his first big film in Asia, The Drunken Master (1978). Chan then went onto gain even more international stardom with Police Story (1985). Chan had made a bunch of films in the US, but never made it famous here until his 1995 film, Rumble in The Bronx. I hate it when this happens, America acts like they've discovered something big and great and they're the first ones who knew about it. Joke's on them ! Jackie had already been famous for over 20 years before his big LATE US debut. This is also when the popular rumor of Chan doing every single one of his stunts began. Its a lie people, not a fact. Jackie DOES MOST OF HIS OWN STUNTS.....not all. Anyways, New Line Cinema in the mid-90s seemed to be the US film company that bought most of Jackie's films (Dimension owned and released a few, but nowhere near as much as New Line), such as Police Story 1 & 2, and was the distributor to the US for Chan's most recent films. It seems as if New Line Cinema's editors are very underpaid, so they practically chopped up and edited so much up of Jackie's movies its unbearable. One common practice is adding a main title sequence. In most Hong Kong films there really is no opening credits, but just the film's title and the main star along with the director etc. But here a whole title sequence is made, as well as changing the film's score. These are New Line's attempts at Americanizing Chan's movies. But, isn't that the whole point of foreign films ? To watch them as they are ?! Plus, watching New Line's disgraceful edits is an insult to the film makers since they've worked so hard on this project and then stuff gets changed and torn out, so you're not watching it the way it was intended. Some of New Line's biggest edits are on First Strike, Mr. Nice Guy, and Rumble in The Bronx ! Mr. Nice Guy for example was released here in US theatres in its original uncut 113 minute length, but when New Line released the DVD they CHOPPED IT DOWN TO ONLY 84 MINUTES ! Woah !!! These companies have so much control, that they actually have had the US edits have world wide distribution ! So now the uncut dvds are virtually impossible to find !!!! Even in Asia the cut US dvds are the most popular to find ! ASS !!! Another thing is the dubbing. New Line's dubbing is done way better than Dimension's dubbing. In First Strike its very interesting. The film was originally shot with a bunch of languages since, Chan is an international agent in this one. I mean that, Jackie Chan speaks English, Cantonese and Mandarin throughout the movie, while the Russians of course speak Russian as well as English. But in the US version everyone speaks English. So in the part where the Russian agent and the Chinese agent talking through their computers makes more sense, since the Chinese guy can't speak Russian, and the Russians can't speak Chinese. The US version you'll find yourself confused. 'well, if they both speak English why can't they just talk to each other ?' Another strange dubbing detail I noticed was that some of the characters who speak English in the movie are re-dubbed anyways to maybe hide their accents. In some cases very bad Russian stereotype voices. Hey, New Line ! I have an idea, for Jackie's next movie why not just make it run only an hour and make Jackie look like a white guy so he appeals more to stupid Americans!! ! Maybe that's better !

    jackie chan's first strike is your typical jackie chan fare featuring all the brilliant fight scenes and breathetaking stunts one expects from the chanster. a big improvement over supercop while not as good as jackie chan's who am i, never the less this is perfect entertainment from start to finish as jackie chan is hired by the c.i.a and gets tangled in some dangereous stuff and people are not to be trusted, but hey jackie chan movies are rarely there for story lines, the storyline is just the excuse to have some great fight scenes and stunts and here first strike delivers. i am one of the biggest jackie chan fans in the uk i think anyway and have seen all his films, and even though first strike isn't one of his best it's a solid effort none the less.

    This is probably the breakthrough movie for Jackie Chan into the western Hollywood scene. It has just about all the crazy Jackie Chan stunt works in this, with those trademark silly and goofy moments. I can see why this movie was a hit when it first came out, it just has almost all the right Jackie Chan elements. It's short, but fun and exciting most of the way through. The plot is typical with no appearance by Maggie Cheung. Which doesn't really matter since, this movie is on target and knows which direction to head to for the most part. This movie just might have the biggest budget and the most crazy stunt work by Jackie Chan in this franchise as well. Maybe it's because the premise and setting of the movie doesn't only take place in China. Which might be one of the reason why this movie was able to reach wider audiences at the time. This one might not be the end of the "Police Story" saga but it's the end of this series story. Until the reboot that is. Overall this isn't just a good Jackie Chan movie but it's also a important film for Jackie Chan. It's worth checking out for sure, especially for the fans of Jackie Chan and his work. 8.4/10

    OK first, Jackie Chan stumbling around a Russian ski resort in a fluffy sea lion hat is priceless! An awful heck of a lot happens in the first 30 min alone. There were a lot of things I found a riot that were subtle and the slapstick variety. Like when Jackie is on a snowmobile at the ski resort and comes to a restricted area with a warning sign of one guy shooting another guy if you cross - he calls his superiors and asks what to do an the guy says, "Oh that's just for kids." So Jackie forges on. LMAO It's done do deadpan I'm not sure if it's intended to be funny, but I was roaring. The action keeps moving and there are some amazing moments like the famous ladder fight scene. The humor is great and well-placed and there's even a credible reason for Jackie to get naked at one point. His attempts to hide himself had me laughing out loud. This is one of those movies that you'll enjoy if you just let yourself enjoy it and not try to make sense of it. I found the story went in way too many directions to follow. But everything that goes on on screen is so much fun I kinda didn't care.

In the English dubbed version of the film that I saw this character has been renamed Jackie.

    Part 4 of the Police Story series sees Jackie Chan's agile Hong Kong police inspector Chan Ka Kui become embroiled in James Bond-style international espionage after he is given the seemingly simple task of following beautiful suspect Natasha to Ukraine. When Natasha is abducted at the airport, Chan sets off in hot pursuit only to discover that she is involved with international arms dealers and the sale of a nuclear warhead.

This could lead to the end of the world as we know it. At first Chan is supposed to just keep track of a girl on a plane, but then he ends up getting caught up with the Russian Maufia who later betrays him. As the plot unravels more and more, impressive action sequences do surface such as a snow mobile and helicopter chase (cut from the US version), a prop fight with ladders,brooms, and sticks, and to a climatic under water fight ! Wow ! I have to admit, this film is more of a drama than martial arts film, therefore is quite different from the previous Police Story films. The US version is by no means worth getting after seeing the uncut version. Even though New Line Cinema's DVD of this is only $5, after viewing the uncut (which only surfaced on the Japanese laser disc,VCD disc,DVD, and the Taiwanese DVD as well.) you will realize you've never been swindled out of $5 so bad in your entire life time. The US cuts: Jackie Chan first gained stardom with his first big film in Asia, The Drunken Master (1978). Chan then went onto gain even more international stardom with Police Story (1985). Chan had made a bunch of films in the US, but never made it famous here until his 1995 film, Rumble in The Bronx. I hate it when this happens, America acts like they've discovered something big and great and they're the first ones who knew about it. Joke's on them ! Jackie had already been famous for over 20 years before his big LATE US debut. This is also when the popular rumor of Chan doing every single one of his stunts began. Its a lie people, not a fact. Jackie DOES MOST OF HIS OWN STUNTS.....not all. Anyways, New Line Cinema in the mid-90s seemed to be the US film company that bought most of Jackie's films (Dimension owned and released a few, but nowhere near as much as New Line), such as Police Story 1 & 2, and was the distributor to the US for Chan's most recent films. It seems as if New Line Cinema's editors are very underpaid, so they practically chopped up and edited so much up of Jackie's movies its unbearable. One common practice is adding a main title sequence. In most Hong Kong films there really is no opening credits, but just the film's title and the main star along with the director etc. But here a whole title sequence is made, as well as changing the film's score. These are New Line's attempts at Americanizing Chan's movies. But, isn't that the whole point of foreign films ? To watch them as they are ?! Plus, watching New Line's disgraceful edits is an insult to the film makers since they've worked so hard on this project and then stuff gets changed and torn out, so you're not watching it the way it was intended. Some of New Line's biggest edits are on First Strike, Mr. Nice Guy, and Rumble in The Bronx ! Mr. Nice Guy for example was released here in US theatres in its original uncut 113 minute length, but when New Line released the DVD they CHOPPED IT DOWN TO ONLY 84 MINUTES ! Woah !!! These companies have so much control, that they actually have had the US edits have world wide distribution ! So now the uncut dvds are virtually impossible to find !!!! Even in Asia the cut US dvds are the most popular to find ! ASS !!! Another thing is the dubbing. New Line's dubbing is done way better than Dimension's dubbing. In First Strike its very interesting. The film was originally shot with a bunch of languages since, Chan is an international agent in this one. I mean that, Jackie Chan speaks English, Cantonese and Mandarin throughout the movie, while the Russians of course speak Russian as well as English. But in the US version everyone speaks English. So in the part where the Russian agent and the Chinese agent talking through their computers makes more sense, since the Chinese guy can't speak Russian, and the Russians can't speak Chinese. The US version you'll find yourself confused. 'well, if they both speak English why can't they just talk to each other ?' Another strange dubbing detail I noticed was that some of the characters who speak English in the movie are re-dubbed anyways to maybe hide their accents. In some cases very bad Russian stereotype voices. Hey, New Line ! I have an idea, for Jackie's next movie why not just make it run only an hour and make Jackie look like a white guy so he appeals more to stupid Americans!! ! Maybe that's better !

    jackie chan's first strike is your typical jackie chan fare featuring all the brilliant fight scenes and breathetaking stunts one expects from the chanster. a big improvement over supercop while not as good as jackie chan's who am i, never the less this is perfect entertainment from start to finish as jackie chan is hired by the c.i.a and gets tangled in some dangereous stuff and people are not to be trusted, but hey jackie chan movies are rarely there for story lines, the storyline is just the excuse to have some great fight scenes and stunts and here first strike delivers. i am one of the biggest jackie chan fans in the uk i think anyway and have seen all his films, and even though first strike isn't one of his best it's a solid effort none the less.

    This is probably the breakthrough movie for Jackie Chan into the western Hollywood scene. It has just about all the crazy Jackie Chan stunt works in this, with those trademark silly and goofy moments. I can see why this movie was a hit when it first came out, it just has almost all the right Jackie Chan elements. It's short, but fun and exciting most of the way through. The plot is typical with no appearance by Maggie Cheung. Which doesn't really matter since, this movie is on target and knows which direction to head to for the most part. This movie just might have the biggest budget and the most crazy stunt work by Jackie Chan in this franchise as well. Maybe it's because the premise and setting of the movie doesn't only take place in China. Which might be one of the reason why this movie was able to reach wider audiences at the time. This one might not be the end of the "Police Story" saga but it's the end of this series story. Until the reboot that is. Overall this isn't just a good Jackie Chan movie but it's also a important film for Jackie Chan. It's worth checking out for sure, especially for the fans of Jackie Chan and his work. 8.4/10

    OK first, Jackie Chan stumbling around a Russian ski resort in a fluffy sea lion hat is priceless! An awful heck of a lot happens in the first 30 min alone. There were a lot of things I found a riot that were subtle and the slapstick variety. Like when Jackie is on a snowmobile at the ski resort and comes to a restricted area with a warning sign of one guy shooting another guy if you cross - he calls his superiors and asks what to do an the guy says, "Oh that's just for kids." So Jackie forges on. LMAO It's done do deadpan I'm not sure if it's intended to be funny, but I was roaring. The action keeps moving and there are some amazing moments like the famous ladder fight scene. The humor is great and well-placed and there's even a credible reason for Jackie to get naked at one point. His attempts to hide himself had me laughing out loud. This is one of those movies that you'll enjoy if you just let yourself enjoy it and not try to make sense of it. I found the story went in way too many directions to follow. But everything that goes on on screen is so much fun I kinda didn't care.

    This, the fourth of the Police Story films, sees Hong Kong police officer Insp. Chan Ka Kui travelling from Hong Kong to The Ukraine to Russia and finally to Australia in pursuit of stolen nuclear material. In the English dubbed version of the film that I saw this character has been renamed Jackie. During the course of the film he will have to fight with heavily armed men in the frozen mountains of The Ukraine, clamber around on the outside of a tall hotel while evading two Russian thugs, fight off a huge gang using a step ladder as a weapon and fight more Russians in an aquarium which also contains a deadly shark! He must also work out who he can trust as not everybody is quite what they seem. This film doesn't have quite as much action as the other films in the series that I've seen but what there was, was pretty good and it was clear that the budget was much higher as the action was far more explosive; involving the sort of skiing stunts and exploding helicopters one would expect in a Hollywood movie in fact if it wasn't for the rather obvious dubbing I might have thought it was a Hollywood movie. Jackie Chan does a great job in the lead role; providing the fantastic mix of action and comedy that fans have come to expect. The supporting cast were very much secondary to Jackie Chan but seemed to do a reasonably job; not hearing the actors actual voices does of course make it hard to judge them fairly. The plot may seem like something out of a Bond film but this is no rip off; you'd never see Bond shivering in the cold or wearing 'koala undies'! If you like comedy action this is well worth seeing and as there is little to offend it is probably suitable for younger viewers too.

    This is the one in which Jackie Chan performs miracles with a tall stepladder, and it's a sequence that quite frankly boggles the mind. Chan makes it look easy, but when you see the out-takes at the end of the film you'll see just how painful those stunts could be. He's a Bond-style super agent in this one - the fourth in a series apparently, although you won't need to have seen any of the previous films to follow this one. He's after a rogue agent in possession of a nuclear warhead or something, but the plot is secondary to the action so it doesn't really matter. The first twenty minutes or so provide an almost constant serving of action, and later on, as the pace slows a little, the humour kicks in, particularly as Chan and his foe suck their bleeding thumbs as they do battle in a tank occupied by a hungry shark

    This is the fourth installment of Jackie Chan's Police story series. The movie is separated into two parts. The first part is in Russia and the second part is in Australia. Jackie is after an ex-CIA agent Tsui who've stolen a nuclear bomb. Another group of terrorists are after the bomb too. Jackie gets between the terrorists and Tsui, and the terrorists tries to kill him too. Tsui's sister Annie and Jackie gets together, and tries to recover the case hidden in the aquarium. This movie was made during the period Jackie Chan was making movies in international locations. The story and the comedy is especially well done, perhaps it's because the screen play was written by four people. The fight sequences at the high rise hotel and the aquarium are one of Jackie's best. Good movie that will give you lots of laughs and action.

    I recognised the title and had seen the poster a few times, naturally starring one of the world's most famous martial artists I was interested to see it, no matter what rating the critics give it. Basically Insp. Jackie Chan Ka Kui (Jackie Chan) is the cop participating in some kind of sting operation on an international spy ring, he seems to be working for both the FBI and the Russians. One of the key spies, Jackson Tsui (Jackson Liu), manages to get away, and Jackie is the one ordered to catch and arrest him. What this leads to a is a journey across parts of the world, meeting up with the spy's sister Annie Tsui (Annie Chen Chun Wu) in Australia. Obviously along the way there are one or two fights where Jackie tries his best to fight back and stay alive, and in the end of course the case is solves after he has saved the day. Also starring Bill Tung as 'Uncle' Bill Wong, Yuri Petrov as Col. Gregor Yegorov, Nonna Grishaeva as Natasha, John Eaves as Mark and Terry Woo as Uncle Seven. Chan is obviously a good character, it is odd that he has to dub himself in a few scenes, many of the other actors are out of sync, the story is not the most engaging ever, in fact I lost track of what was going on, but there are some inventive fight sequences with Chan's cool stunt work, but apart from that I wouldn't really bother with this action thriller. Adequate!

    Part 4 of the Police Story series sees Jackie Chan's agile Hong Kong police inspector Chan Ka Kui become embroiled in James Bond-style international espionage after he is given the seemingly simple task of following beautiful suspect Natasha to Ukraine. When Natasha is abducted at the airport, Chan sets off in hot pursuit only to discover that she is involved with international arms dealers and the sale of a nuclear warhead. First Strike was made in the mid 90s, a transitional period for Jackie Chan, who was priming himself for his big move to the US. In order to broaden the star's appeal with the Western market, this one has a much more international flavour than many of his earlier films, with the action skipping round the globe, from Hong Kong to Ukraine to Russia and, finally, to Australia. The film is also less focused on pure martial arts mayhem, with more in the way of straight forward Hollywood style stunt-filled action, but when the kung fu does happen it is extremely well handled, with Jackie displaying his usual athleticism, impeccable timing, and flair for physical comedy. The rather messy plot and occasionally slow pacing prevents First Strike from being a bona fide Chan classic, but there is still plenty of inventive stuff to make this one a whole lot of fun, best bits being a wonderful fight scene in which Chan uses a stepladder as a weapon, an exhilarating ski chase down a mountain, some underwater shenanigans with sharks, and a scrap with two Russian man-mountains that involves Chan making a vertiginous leap onto a narrow ledge of a high-rise building.

    FIRST STRIKE packs a violent confrontation between Jackie and double agents from CIA and KGB . This exciting story about the cop named Chang Wing of the Hong Kong precinct is well played by Jackie Chan. Chang participates in a sting operation against an international spy-ring that is smuggling nuclear weapons from Ukraine. But when one of them (Tsui) escapes , Jackie is ordered to capture him . This leads Jackie all over the globe beginning with Tsui's sister (Annie Wu) at Australia . The story follows him as he attempts to stay alive and chase the villain. When his police buddies are deceived by a wicked criminal band , Wing turns into an unfortunate spy when he is also double-crossed . A young woman helps him to track down and apprehend the gang commanded by a double agent. Then Chan looks for vengeance against the ominous villains at a cat and mouse game. This exciting movie is crammed of action-packed, overwhelming stunt-work and lots of violence but with humor. Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous criminals and as always he makes his own stunts like is showed on the final fake-shots . Awesome ,incredible stunts and brief comic touches , as usual ; the picture is better constructed than its predecessor . The lighting-paced storyline slows down at times , but frantic action sequences make up for it . Spotlights movie include a stirring pursuit on the snow and underwater fights surrounded by sharks in James Bond style , among others . This is a phenomenal action movie distinguished by nicely cinematography of the spectacular sequences , and contains agreeable sense of humor such as previous entries . However while the former outings Jackie teamed up to prestigious actresses and fine action stars in their own right , like Maggie Cheung and Michelle Khan , at this film his parternaire is unknown . Thrilling and moving musical score fitting to action by J. Peter Robinson . The picture is lavishly produced by the great Asian producers Raymond Chow and Golden Harvest production and efficiently directed by Stanley Tong . The first version titled &uml;Police story(1985)&uml; directed by the same Jackie Chan was a perfect action film for enthusiastic of the genre ; the following was &uml;Police story 2(1988)&uml; also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches . It's followed by &uml;Police story V : Crime story&uml; and finally &uml;New Police story&uml; by Benny Chan . Rating : Accepatable and passable, the picture has its sensational moments here and there , mostly provided by its agile star, the super Jackie Chan .

    Originally called Police Story 4:First Strike, Jackie Chan made this in 1996 and is the last of the original Police Story films in which he plays his Police Story character, Chan-Kai Ku. Chan's next Police Story film, New Police Story, would be a new generation film to the series and released in 2004. As we all know Jackie Chan is probably the best martial arts actor on screen next to Bruce Lee. Chan took fighting sequences as we know it and made them so much more entertaining. Including prop fights and fights in so many cool places. An example of cool creative Chan fight scene would be in this one where Jackie battles Russian Maufia henchmen UNDER WATER ! With sharks !! Later in the review I will clarify on the US cuts of Jackie's films. Chan-Kai Ku returns again, and this time he's not battling gangs in Hong Kong or its surrounding areas, he's now an international agent trying to stop the illegal selling of uranium bombs. This could lead to the end of the world as we know it. At first Chan is supposed to just keep track of a girl on a plane, but then he ends up getting caught up with the Russian Maufia who later betrays him.
