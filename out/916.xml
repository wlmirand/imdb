 <sinopse>
  The Robinson family was going into space to fight for a chance for humanity. Now they are fighting to live long enough to find a way home.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In the year 2058, the Earth will soon be uninhabitable after the irreversible effects of pollution and global warming! Professor John Robinson, lead scientist of the Jupiter 2 Mission, will lead his family to the habitable planet Alpha Prime to prep it for colonization. The Jupiter 2 is equipped with a hyperdrive that allows faster-than-light travel, which will eventually be employed to evacuate the citizens of Earth. However hypergates must be constructed on Earth and Alpha Prime to provide stable points of departure and arrival. Dr. Zachary Smith is bribed by a terrorist organization to sabotage the mission, and ends up an unwilling stowaway as the ship blasts off.

    There seems to be a bit of a fad in remaking old television shows, but then Hollywood will do anything to make a little bit of money. Lost in Space is based on the very old TV series and has been spruced up by the typical Hollywood glitz. I never really got into the original series and the movie didn't really reach my expectations. The situation is that the Earth is dying and Professor Robinson is going on a mission to travel to another planet and build a hypergate so that colonists may move to this new world. Unfortunately there is an organisation that wishes to halt this progress and instead colonise this world for themselves. They pay Doctor Smith (Gary Oldman) to sabotage the mission, and decide to kill him while he is on the ship. When the ship, the Jupiter 2, takes off, Doctor Smith is on board as well as a killer robot. There is no single plot in this movie as once one problem is solved another one arises. The ultimate goal is to either return home or to complete their mission but this is not addressed in the movie. It is left open so as to possibly bring out a sequel. The plot elements are developed from the beginning though so the movie is a bit predictable. There is a large emphasis placed on Will Robinson's time travel experiments and they also talk about how hyperspace engines will send you to a random place in the galaxy and thus are very unreliable. When they mentioned that I knew how they were going to become lost. This movie places emphasis more on family values and seems to be directed towards those of use who are or are planning on becoming fathers. Basically the moral is that our family is the most important part of our lives and we should put a lot of time into it. Professor Robinson wanted to head the mission but said that the only way he would do it is if his family came along. This is really selfish as it would have been far better if he did not marry and have a family so that he had no ties when he went gallivanting off over the galaxy. This idea is brought up. I guess they want to address the growing problem of families that are breaking apart. The family unit is no longer as solid as people believed that it was and the reason addressed in this movie is because we all pursue our own personal goals and not as a family.

    Incredibly bad storyline and continuity. A series of computer-generated story sequences strung together like a cheap necklace. It starts out well enough with a great opening sequence involving a crisis in space, then it quickly falls apart. Dr. Smith, always the villain, mutates into a giant bug! How can you fly through the sun? Time travel and the space-time continuum jumbled together at the finale in such a way that the whole thing makes even less sense than the puzzling ending to Disneys' "The Black Hole"! An annoying computer-generated pet monkey that hangs around sister "Penny's" neck and appears to have ADHD. Exhausting to watch. Sure not as much fun as the old silly Irwin Allen TV series. A total disappointment. One of the worst sci-fi movies of all time. So bad I was rootin' for the space spiders! I still love the robot, however. But he hasn't had any good lines since "Forbidden Planet".

    What have the following got in common? Disney's Black Hole, Alien, Aliens, Gremlins, The Thing (John Carpenter version), all Star Trek movies and TV episodes featuring technobabble and time travelling, the special effects in Dr Who, leading edge FX? The answer is that they have all been plagiarised or used in this film along with many other films and artefacts too numerous to mention. If you insist on going to see this film then you'd better resign yourself to the fact that every other scene will remind you of something else and that scenes of technical FX mastery will be followed by, or mixed with, scenes of such naffness that they would make the crew of Blake's 7 blush in embarrassment. I think there may have been a good film in there somewhere but it is too late for it ever to be reconstituted. The Robinson family, for it is they, get lost not only in space but also in time, not to mention lost in plot. Let's face it, apart from a very obvious thing that happens with Will Robinson, the plot is utterly incomprehensible. The Robinsons seem to be flung into the far reaches of time, space and plot by baddies with inscrutable plans, onto spaceships which may or may not have anything to do with the plot but look cool and have spiffy monsters, in periods of time which may be before after or sideways from the main timeline. Do not try to make sense of this if you value your mental health. Some good bits are; the casting is pretty effective, especially Gary Oldman, some of the FX are quite stunning, music and soundtrack are fine, things explode and go "whoosh" a lot, the robot is well cool and delivers some of the best acting in the film with the immortal "Danger Will Robinson, Danger!" So long as you let yourself go this is rather similar to the experience of taking hallucinatory drugs (allegedly) and of similar value.

    It's obvious the directors had no comprehension of the Space/Time continuum because this film defies it in so many ways. I say this mainly as the third act opens as Space Family Robinson are hurled decades into the future (at least 20 years I imagine but they don't specify this), where on a distant world they bump into their future selves. The main problem with this idea is that in order for them to bump into their older selves their older selves would have had to have been living on the planet for the past 20 years or so, whereas in the film they had just arrived, meaning they couldn't possibly live there. Also, Dr Smith kills his past self and yet his future self doesn't disappear, and young Will Robinson is killed in an explosion yet the future William doesn't disappear either. Apart from that the acting is as bland as cardboard as many of the characters have no defining character. Dr Smith is you're usual over the top bad guy (although my favourite part used to be when he had become his spider self, a character indulged in mystery but that's heading off track), John Robinson's character is unrealistically emotionless, Matt le Blanc is your average rough Space Cowboy type, the elder daughter is your typical hard-to-get type, the younger daughter is often considered to be the Missing Chipette and Will doesn't get enough credit for his amazing work, instead he gets bawled off by his siblings and his talent is only really exploited by the bad guy Dr. Smith, which leads to later character development but it would have needed to have been a longer more developed film, where rather than stumbling across their future selves, the film could have been a documentary of how the Robinson's struggled to survive on the harsh and unforgiving world and eventually another set of characters come across them leading to the events of the end of the film, etc, etc. Overall, a weak attempt at sci-fi with some OK CGI but not much else going for it...

    In the year 2058 Earth is suffering of pollution and will soon be uninhabitable after the irreversible effects of global warming. Space colony family struggles to survive when a spy/accidental stowaway throws their ship hopelessly off course. Professor John Robinson (William Hurt), his wife Maureen (Mimi Rogers) , their children Judy (Heather Graham) , Penny (Lacey Chabert) and Will (Jack Johnson) and Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc , Sean Patrick Flanery was originally cast and was also previously offered to Matthew Perry) are selected to go to the third planet in the Alpha Centauri star system to establish a colony so that other Earth people can settle there. They are to go there on a ship christened the Jupiter 2. However, Doctor Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman) , an agent for an enemy (Edward Fox) , is sent to sabotage the mission. He is successful in reprogramming the ship's robot, but in the process becomes trapped on the ship , the ship and all on board become hopelessly lost and it now becomes a fight for survival as the crew tries to find their way back home . Now they are fighting to live long enough to find a way home . Familiar Sci-Fi dealing with Robinson family was going into space to fight for a chance for humanity , it is plenty of special effects , thrills , action though regularly developed . The picture has some good moments here and there , but is also full of flaws and gaps . Screenplay by Akiva Goldsman who wrote a script with absurd situations and embarrassing scenes. Silly and ridiculous images , especially starred by the computer monkey made by means of botching effects and the giant spider-Doctor Smith too . Mediocre performances and all principals actors were contracted to a three picture option, but as the film failed to recoup its budget in North America, plans for a new franchise were scrapped . Good photography by cinematographer Peter Levy who frequently works with the filmmaker . Thrilling and atmospheric musical score by Bruce Broughton . The motion picture was middling directed by Stephen Hopkins who has realized some acceptable Sci-Fi and Terror films as &uml;Nightmare in ElmStreet 5 &uml; , &uml;Predator 2&uml;, &uml;The reaping &uml; , though his better films were &uml;The ghost and the darkness&uml; and &uml;The life and death of Peter Sellers&uml;. &uml;Lost in space&uml; turns out to be his worst movie . Rating : Below average . The classic and best version results to be 84 episodes for television produced by Irwin Allen , starred by Guy Williams (John Robinson) , June Lockhart ( Maureen Robinson) , Mark Goddard (Maj. Don West), Marta Kristen (Judy Robinson) , Bill Mumy ( Will Robinson) and Angela Cartwright . (Penny Robinson).Originally, all surviving cast members of the TV show were meant to have cameo appearances. Mark Goddard, the original Major Don West, plays the General. June Lockhart,plays Will Robinson's principal , Marta Kristen and Angela Cartwright play reporters and Dick Tufeld reprises his role from Lost in Space as the voice of the Robot. Ironically, Bill Mumy and Jonathan Harris, the two actors most supportive of the idea of a new movie , did not appear in it.

    I cannot believe all the wannabe movie critics ripping this movie apart. All of the negative reviews appear to be from people comparing it to the TV series. If there never was a TV series, they'd be lauding it's wonderful effects and story line, but they are so busy comparing it line-by-line to the original series, they can't get past it. Are you serious? You really wanted this movie to be anything like that crummy TV series? Get over it. The series laid a good plot line, but beyond that it was cheaply made and the scripts were so G-rated there was almost no story at all. And the character development in the series was plastic and phony, to the point of being non-existent, even for the 60's. I was a 9 year old boy when this series was first aired on TV, and when I watched it, the most fun I had was ripping it apart because of how fake it was. Even as a 9-year-old I could see that. Guys love to do this, and this is the show that taught me how to do it. Even so, I enjoyed it for what it was - SciFi on prime time. Now this updated movie actually does some character building and provides an interesting plot, and the history buffs can't stand it. There is a reason why LIS was canceled, and why so many SciFi prime time shows don't last long. People want to see the grit, the fire, the real people behind the characters, not some Hollywood plastic version. Because I didn't fall into the trap of comparing it with the original series, I loved this movie. It is SciFi at it's best. Good story, good character building, good back story on the plot and characters, great effects, twists, turns, action. This may be the most underrated SciFi movie of all time. Watch it without comparisons to the TV series, and you are guaranteed to enjoy.

    Those who have followed and been long time fans of Lost In Space (1965) TV series will be just as disappointed, as I was. What most everyone was looking for in seeing certainly wasn't a remake but a conclusion. Where the Robinson family & stowaway Dr. Smith would finally make it to the new Earth, Alpha Centauri...not Alpha Prime, for colonization. What was totally out of character was when John and Don got into a verbal fight and were disrespectful over who would lead the mission, including the obscene P word that Maureen used to set them straight. Also how Will and Penny were like from a dysfunctional family, where they didn't get along and were preoccupied with their own self-worths and what mattered to only them. Even, Don hitting on Judy as if she was something to conquer for the fulfillment of his ego wasn't right. Instead of giving the viewer something they didn't know about each character, the creators played off of what one already knows, combined with some kind of disrespect & immorality (which is the opposite of what the original characters were all about). While the latter is what most of real society appears to be like today, there are still good, decent people in the world. So why patronize bad for good? I thought it was a joke when they used a bald man during the launch for Alpha Control. During the launch, when we saw how the likeness of the original Jupiter 2 , as Jupiter 1, was blown off, like some temporary booster fuselage, with a new Jupiter 2 design emerging (butterfly effect of coming out of a cocoon), it was as though the creators were saying "Out with the old and in with the new." Even the short cameo appearance of the original cast bothered me to no end, as I felt they were taken badly advantage of, as filmsy attempt to gain long time LIS fans favor. When we were all looking forward to seeing our favorites as they are today. With the unfortunate loss of Guy Williams, the creators still could of used the original cast members. All they would of had to to is put Williams in much like how The Crow, City of Angels (1996) was done to fill in for Brandon Lee. Or they could of resorted to like Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001) used total computer generated characters. Lastly, they could of done a nation wide search for someone who looks exactly like Guy Williams to be Professor John Robinson. Those who were not accepted or were convincing as the characters they portrayed is William Hurt as Prof. Robinson, Jack Johnson as Will and Jared Harris as the older Will. Gary Oldman as Dr. Smith was OK but they could of done better. The boy who in a Campbell's Soup commercial that came in out of the cold and melted his snowman appearance away, I felt would of been a better choice for Will Robinson than someone who looked too much like the Space Monkey. Another thumbs down is the older Will didn't even so much resemble the younger Will. Another bad thing thing that can't be ignored is when did John Robinson have blondish looking hair? The only things I could say was good about the movie was the futuristic designs, special effects and why it was vitally important that the Robinson family make it to pioneer in the colonization of a new planet with earth-like conditions.

    I am relatively sure they were hoping to do a sequel or two for this film, however no sequels were ever forthcoming and this film is pretty much a forgotten film of the 90's whose main claim to fame is the fact it knocked off Titanic from the number one spot at the movies. That does not mean your film is good, I do believe all the guys got together and said to themselves "This looks tolerable" and they poured into theaters just to sink the ship. I am surprised the score is so low here, granted the score I am giving it is not much higher, but I have to say some of the visuals were quite good and there were some interesting things going on in this movie. Just way to much in the plot, it went here and there and crammed a whole lot of stuff in the film making it a bit to long and to jumbled. The film is about a family that gets lost in space thanks to the dastardly Dr. Smith played by Gary Oldman who is the only really interesting character in the film. Everyone else is bland with the exception of Matt LeBlanc who is just horribly miscast in an action type role which he neither has the acting ability or looks to do. The best thing about this film is the effects as the are very good, especially considering when this film was made. It just needed a whole lot of work on the plot, a bit of simplifying rather than the "let's throw it all in" approach they seemed to take with this one. Still, it did knock out Titanic, before it quickly sank into obscurity.

    First, let me point out two saving graces for this movie. Gary Oldman's performance was very entertaining and the visuals are very cool looking which is the reason why I'm giving this a two out of ten. So, what's wrong with this movie? EVERYTHING! The story was too clich&eacute;d and predictable, the acting was so horrible, the writing is messed up, the dialogue was god-awful the action is way over the top and it also has poorly CGI quality effects. I think the music was OK, but nothing special. To be honest, I never watch the TV show this movie was based on, but given the horrible reception in this film, I would definitely watch it to keep me interested. Anyway, horrible movie. Avoid it.

    Let me just establish one thing: I am border-line obsessed with Gary Oldman. I think that he is hands down the greatest actor / human being (other than my mum) that the world has ever known. So, naturally, I have made a habit of buying every film of his if I happen to stumble upon it. that is how I came across "Lost in Space". I could tell right away just by looking at the cover that this was going to be yet another one of those cheesy, gaudy 90's sci-fi flicks, but it was $3.99 and it had Gary Oldman in it. Why not? Here is why not: This. Film. Is trash. False. A trash can would not even allow this crap to infect it with its filth. Now, I have never seen the TV series, but if the story line of this film is anything like it, than it's a mystery how it ever stayed on the air. It's just soggy with campy clich&eacute;s. The characters are not even half-baked, and are always making juvenile and completely incompetent one-liners that don't even fit in with the rest of the conversation. Okay. This needs its own paragraph just due to the sheer annoyance of it. That stupid stupid stupid space monkey. What is up with that lame freaking monkey? It's not cute. It's eyes are just . . . It's a pointless monkey. I hate the monkey. That is all. Now for the acting. Don't get me wrong. I love Matt Leblanc in "Friends". But I'm not sure anymore as to whether or not he can actually act. The whole time he's trying to be this Bruce Willis-esque macho man, but he just seems ridiculous in trying. William Hurt is kind of, for lack of a better word, meh. Same goes for Mimi Rogers and Heather Graham.Lacy Chabert - as far as acting talent goes in this film, there is none for Gretchen Wieners, bye. Jack Johnson was fine. Now, Gary Oldman - the reason that I forced myself to sit down in front of this crap for the full 2 hours of torture. Gary, you are a fantastic actor. The best of the best. There is nothing that you have done that is disappointing. But dear Lord in Heaven. Why oh why would you agree to playing a man named Dr. "Spider" Smith? The name alone should give you a red light signal. This is the lamest waste of a villain that the world has ever known. He's uncharismatic, unintelligent, has no chutzpah whatsoever, and doesn't appear to have any motives for his mindless actions. When his future self transforms into a spider, it's not creepy, it's not sad. It's just embarrassing. So so so very cheesy. GARY! PLEASE TELL ME YOU DID NOT READ THE SCRIPT BEFORE AGREEING TO PLAY THIS ONE. To his eternal credit, Mr. Oldman did his best to add some charm and humor to Zachary Smith. For instance, when he says "Yes. Yeees . . . I'm a doctor." I actually laughed a little. Not because the line is funny - none of the script is remotely amusing - but just the bizarrely creepy way he said it. (It's even funnier in the blooper reel when he pauses a bit afterwards before saying ". . . And a pervert". I think they should have kept that in.) Anyway, enough of this banter. Gary, I'm not mad at you, just please don't do this again. So, to sum up, PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS GARBAGE!!! even if you're a fan of Gary oldman - actually, ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of Gary Oldman, just stay away. Yes, he managed to make it slightly watchable, but just barely. If you have any self-respect, do not do what i did and waste a good $3.99 on this mistake of a "film" A very generous 1/10.

    It's obvious the directors had no comprehension of the Space/Time continuum because this film defies it in so many ways. I say this mainly as the third act opens as Space Family Robinson are hurled decades into the future (at least 20 years I imagine but they don't specify this), where on a distant world they bump into their future selves. The main problem with this idea is that in order for them to bump into their older selves their older selves would have had to have been living on the planet for the past 20 years or so, whereas in the film they had just arrived, meaning they couldn't possibly live there. Also, Dr Smith kills his past self and yet his future self doesn't disappear, and young Will Robinson is killed in an explosion yet the future William doesn't disappear either. Apart from that the acting is as bland as cardboard as many of the characters have no defining character. Dr Smith is you're usual over the top bad guy (although my favourite part used to be when he had become his spider self, a character indulged in mystery but that's heading off track), John Robinson's character is unrealistically emotionless, Matt le Blanc is your average rough Space Cowboy type, the elder daughter is your typical hard-to-get type, the younger daughter is often considered to be the Missing Chipette and Will doesn't get enough credit for his amazing work, instead he gets bawled off by his siblings and his talent is only really exploited by the bad guy Dr. Smith, which leads to later character development but it would have needed to have been a longer more developed film, where rather than stumbling across their future selves, the film could have been a documentary of how the Robinson's struggled to survive on the harsh and unforgiving world and eventually another set of characters come across them leading to the events of the end of the film, etc, etc. Overall, a weak attempt at sci-fi with some OK CGI but not much else going for it...

    I cannot believe all the wannabe movie critics ripping this movie apart. All of the negative reviews appear to be from people comparing it to the TV series. If there never was a TV series, they'd be lauding it's wonderful effects and story line, but they are so busy comparing it line-by-line to the original series, they can't get past it. Are you serious? You really wanted this movie to be anything like that crummy TV series? Get over it. The series laid a good plot line, but beyond that it was cheaply made and the scripts were so G-rated there was almost no story at all. And the character development in the series was plastic and phony, to the point of being non-existent, even for the 60's. I was a 9 year old boy when this series was first aired on TV, and when I watched it, the most fun I had was ripping it apart because of how fake it was. Even as a 9-year-old I could see that. Guys love to do this, and this is the show that taught me how to do it. Even so, I enjoyed it for what it was - SciFi on prime time. Now this updated movie actually does some character building and provides an interesting plot, and the history buffs can't stand it. There is a reason why LIS was canceled, and why so many SciFi prime time shows don't last long. People want to see the grit, the fire, the real people behind the characters, not some Hollywood plastic version. Because I didn't fall into the trap of comparing it with the original series, I loved this movie. It is SciFi at it's best. Good story, good character building, good back story on the plot and characters, great effects, twists, turns, action. This may be the most underrated SciFi movie of all time. Watch it without comparisons to the TV series, and you are guaranteed to enjoy.

    Those who have followed and been long time fans of Lost In Space (1965) TV series will be just as disappointed, as I was. What most everyone was looking for in seeing certainly wasn't a remake but a conclusion. Where the Robinson family & stowaway Dr. Smith would finally make it to the new Earth, Alpha Centauri...not Alpha Prime, for colonization. What was totally out of character was when John and Don got into a verbal fight and were disrespectful over who would lead the mission, including the obscene P word that Maureen used to set them straight. Also how Will and Penny were like from a dysfunctional family, where they didn't get along and were preoccupied with their own self-worths and what mattered to only them. Even, Don hitting on Judy as if she was something to conquer for the fulfillment of his ego wasn't right. Instead of giving the viewer something they didn't know about each character, the creators played off of what one already knows, combined with some kind of disrespect & immorality (which is the opposite of what the original characters were all about). While the latter is what most of real society appears to be like today, there are still good, decent people in the world. So why patronize bad for good? I thought it was a joke when they used a bald man during the launch for Alpha Control. During the launch, when we saw how the likeness of the original Jupiter 2 , as Jupiter 1, was blown off, like some temporary booster fuselage, with a new Jupiter 2 design emerging (butterfly effect of coming out of a cocoon), it was as though the creators were saying "Out with the old and in with the new." Even the short cameo appearance of the original cast bothered me to no end, as I felt they were taken badly advantage of, as filmsy attempt to gain long time LIS fans favor. When we were all looking forward to seeing our favorites as they are today. With the unfortunate loss of Guy Williams, the creators still could of used the original cast members. All they would of had to to is put Williams in much like how The Crow, City of Angels (1996) was done to fill in for Brandon Lee. Or they could of resorted to like Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001) used total computer generated characters. Lastly, they could of done a nation wide search for someone who looks exactly like Guy Williams to be Professor John Robinson. Those who were not accepted or were convincing as the characters they portrayed is William Hurt as Prof. Robinson, Jack Johnson as Will and Jared Harris as the older Will. Gary Oldman as Dr. Smith was OK but they could of done better. The boy who in a Campbell's Soup commercial that came in out of the cold and melted his snowman appearance away, I felt would of been a better choice for Will Robinson than someone who looked too much like the Space Monkey. Another thumbs down is the older Will didn't even so much resemble the younger Will. Another bad thing thing that can't be ignored is when did John Robinson have blondish looking hair? The only things I could say was good about the movie was the futuristic designs, special effects and why it was vitally important that the Robinson family make it to pioneer in the colonization of a new planet with earth-like conditions.

    I am relatively sure they were hoping to do a sequel or two for this film, however no sequels were ever forthcoming and this film is pretty much a forgotten film of the 90's whose main claim to fame is the fact it knocked off Titanic from the number one spot at the movies. That does not mean your film is good, I do believe all the guys got together and said to themselves "This looks tolerable" and they poured into theaters just to sink the ship. I am surprised the score is so low here, granted the score I am giving it is not much higher, but I have to say some of the visuals were quite good and there were some interesting things going on in this movie. Just way to much in the plot, it went here and there and crammed a whole lot of stuff in the film making it a bit to long and to jumbled. The film is about a family that gets lost in space thanks to the dastardly Dr. Smith played by Gary Oldman who is the only really interesting character in the film. Everyone else is bland with the exception of Matt LeBlanc who is just horribly miscast in an action type role which he neither has the acting ability or looks to do. The best thing about this film is the effects as the are very good, especially considering when this film was made. It just needed a whole lot of work on the plot, a bit of simplifying rather than the "let's throw it all in" approach they seemed to take with this one. Still, it did knock out Titanic, before it quickly sank into obscurity.

    First, let me point out two saving graces for this movie. Gary Oldman's performance was very entertaining and the visuals are very cool looking which is the reason why I'm giving this a two out of ten. So, what's wrong with this movie? EVERYTHING! The story was too clich&eacute;d and predictable, the acting was so horrible, the writing is messed up, the dialogue was god-awful the action is way over the top and it also has poorly CGI quality effects. I think the music was OK, but nothing special. To be honest, I never watch the TV show this movie was based on, but given the horrible reception in this film, I would definitely watch it to keep me interested. Anyway, horrible movie. Avoid it.

    Let me just establish one thing: I am border-line obsessed with Gary Oldman. I think that he is hands down the greatest actor / human being (other than my mum) that the world has ever known. So, naturally, I have made a habit of buying every film of his if I happen to stumble upon it. that is how I came across "Lost in Space". I could tell right away just by looking at the cover that this was going to be yet another one of those cheesy, gaudy 90's sci-fi flicks, but it was $3.99 and it had Gary Oldman in it. Why not? Here is why not: This. Film. Is trash. False. A trash can would not even allow this crap to infect it with its filth. Now, I have never seen the TV series, but if the story line of this film is anything like it, than it's a mystery how it ever stayed on the air. It's just soggy with campy clich&eacute;s. The characters are not even half-baked, and are always making juvenile and completely incompetent one-liners that don't even fit in with the rest of the conversation. Okay. This needs its own paragraph just due to the sheer annoyance of it. That stupid stupid stupid space monkey. What is up with that lame freaking monkey? It's not cute. It's eyes are just . . . It's a pointless monkey. I hate the monkey. That is all. Now for the acting. Don't get me wrong. I love Matt Leblanc in "Friends". But I'm not sure anymore as to whether or not he can actually act. The whole time he's trying to be this Bruce Willis-esque macho man, but he just seems ridiculous in trying. William Hurt is kind of, for lack of a better word, meh. Same goes for Mimi Rogers and Heather Graham.Lacy Chabert - as far as acting talent goes in this film, there is none for Gretchen Wieners, bye. Jack Johnson was fine. Now, Gary Oldman - the reason that I forced myself to sit down in front of this crap for the full 2 hours of torture. Gary, you are a fantastic actor. The best of the best. There is nothing that you have done that is disappointing. But dear Lord in Heaven. Why oh why would you agree to playing a man named Dr. "Spider" Smith? The name alone should give you a red light signal. This is the lamest waste of a villain that the world has ever known. He's uncharismatic, unintelligent, has no chutzpah whatsoever, and doesn't appear to have any motives for his mindless actions. When his future self transforms into a spider, it's not creepy, it's not sad. It's just embarrassing. So so so very cheesy. GARY! PLEASE TELL ME YOU DID NOT READ THE SCRIPT BEFORE AGREEING TO PLAY THIS ONE. To his eternal credit, Mr. Oldman did his best to add some charm and humor to Zachary Smith. For instance, when he says "Yes. Yeees . . . I'm a doctor." I actually laughed a little. Not because the line is funny - none of the script is remotely amusing - but just the bizarrely creepy way he said it. (It's even funnier in the blooper reel when he pauses a bit afterwards before saying ". . . And a pervert". I think they should have kept that in.) Anyway, enough of this banter. Gary, I'm not mad at you, just please don't do this again. So, to sum up, PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS GARBAGE!!! even if you're a fan of Gary oldman - actually, ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of Gary Oldman, just stay away. Yes, he managed to make it slightly watchable, but just barely. If you have any self-respect, do not do what i did and waste a good $3.99 on this mistake of a "film" A very generous 1/10.

    There seems to be a bit of a fad in remaking old television shows, but then Hollywood will do anything to make a little bit of money. Lost in Space is based on the very old TV series and has been spruced up by the typical Hollywood glitz. I never really got into the original series and the movie didn't really reach my expectations. The situation is that the Earth is dying and Professor Robinson is going on a mission to travel to another planet and build a hypergate so that colonists may move to this new world. Unfortunately there is an organisation that wishes to halt this progress and instead colonise this world for themselves. They pay Doctor Smith (Gary Oldman) to sabotage the mission, and decide to kill him while he is on the ship. When the ship, the Jupiter 2, takes off, Doctor Smith is on board as well as a killer robot. There is no single plot in this movie as once one problem is solved another one arises. The ultimate goal is to either return home or to complete their mission but this is not addressed in the movie. It is left open so as to possibly bring out a sequel. The plot elements are developed from the beginning though so the movie is a bit predictable. There is a large emphasis placed on Will Robinson's time travel experiments and they also talk about how hyperspace engines will send you to a random place in the galaxy and thus are very unreliable. When they mentioned that I knew how they were going to become lost. This movie places emphasis more on family values and seems to be directed towards those of use who are or are planning on becoming fathers. Basically the moral is that our family is the most important part of our lives and we should put a lot of time into it. Professor Robinson wanted to head the mission but said that the only way he would do it is if his family came along. This is really selfish as it would have been far better if he did not marry and have a family so that he had no ties when he went gallivanting off over the galaxy. This idea is brought up. I guess they want to address the growing problem of families that are breaking apart. The family unit is no longer as solid as people believed that it was and the reason addressed in this movie is because we all pursue our own personal goals and not as a family.

    Incredibly bad storyline and continuity. A series of computer-generated story sequences strung together like a cheap necklace. It starts out well enough with a great opening sequence involving a crisis in space, then it quickly falls apart. Dr. Smith, always the villain, mutates into a giant bug! How can you fly through the sun? Time travel and the space-time continuum jumbled together at the finale in such a way that the whole thing makes even less sense than the puzzling ending to Disneys' "The Black Hole"! An annoying computer-generated pet monkey that hangs around sister "Penny's" neck and appears to have ADHD. Exhausting to watch. Sure not as much fun as the old silly Irwin Allen TV series. A total disappointment. One of the worst sci-fi movies of all time. So bad I was rootin' for the space spiders! I still love the robot, however. But he hasn't had any good lines since "Forbidden Planet".

    What have the following got in common? Disney's Black Hole, Alien, Aliens, Gremlins, The Thing (John Carpenter version), all Star Trek movies and TV episodes featuring technobabble and time travelling, the special effects in Dr Who, leading edge FX? The answer is that they have all been plagiarised or used in this film along with many other films and artefacts too numerous to mention. If you insist on going to see this film then you'd better resign yourself to the fact that every other scene will remind you of something else and that scenes of technical FX mastery will be followed by, or mixed with, scenes of such naffness that they would make the crew of Blake's 7 blush in embarrassment. I think there may have been a good film in there somewhere but it is too late for it ever to be reconstituted. The Robinson family, for it is they, get lost not only in space but also in time, not to mention lost in plot. Let's face it, apart from a very obvious thing that happens with Will Robinson, the plot is utterly incomprehensible. The Robinsons seem to be flung into the far reaches of time, space and plot by baddies with inscrutable plans, onto spaceships which may or may not have anything to do with the plot but look cool and have spiffy monsters, in periods of time which may be before after or sideways from the main timeline. Do not try to make sense of this if you value your mental health. Some good bits are; the casting is pretty effective, especially Gary Oldman, some of the FX are quite stunning, music and soundtrack are fine, things explode and go "whoosh" a lot, the robot is well cool and delivers some of the best acting in the film with the immortal "Danger Will Robinson, Danger!" So long as you let yourself go this is rather similar to the experience of taking hallucinatory drugs (allegedly) and of similar value.

During the launch, when we saw how the likeness of the original Jupiter 2 , as Jupiter 1, was blown off, like some temporary booster fuselage, with a new Jupiter 2 design emerging (butterfly effect of coming out of a cocoon), it was as though the creators were saying "Out with the old and in with the new." Even the short cameo appearance of the original cast bothered me to no end, as I felt they were taken badly advantage of, as filmsy attempt to gain long time LIS fans favor. When we were all looking forward to seeing our favorites as they are today. With the unfortunate loss of Guy Williams, the creators still could of used the original cast members. All they would of had to to is put Williams in much like how The Crow, City of Angels (1996) was done to fill in for Brandon Lee. Or they could of resorted to like Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001) used total computer generated characters.

Another thumbs down is the older Will didn't even so much resemble the younger Will. Another bad thing thing that can't be ignored is when did John Robinson have blondish looking hair? The only things I could say was good about the movie was the futuristic designs, special effects and why it was vitally important that the Robinson family make it to pioneer in the colonization of a new planet with earth-like conditions.

    I am relatively sure they were hoping to do a sequel or two for this film, however no sequels were ever forthcoming and this film is pretty much a forgotten film of the 90's whose main claim to fame is the fact it knocked off Titanic from the number one spot at the movies. That does not mean your film is good, I do believe all the guys got together and said to themselves "This looks tolerable" and they poured into theaters just to sink the ship. I am surprised the score is so low here, granted the score I am giving it is not much higher, but I have to say some of the visuals were quite good and there were some interesting things going on in this movie. Just way to much in the plot, it went here and there and crammed a whole lot of stuff in the film making it a bit to long and to jumbled. The film is about a family that gets lost in space thanks to the dastardly Dr. Smith played by Gary Oldman who is the only really interesting character in the film. Everyone else is bland with the exception of Matt LeBlanc who is just horribly miscast in an action type role which he neither has the acting ability or looks to do. The best thing about this film is the effects as the are very good, especially considering when this film was made. It just needed a whole lot of work on the plot, a bit of simplifying rather than the "let's throw it all in" approach they seemed to take with this one. Still, it did knock out Titanic, before it quickly sank into obscurity.

    First, let me point out two saving graces for this movie. Gary Oldman's performance was very entertaining and the visuals are very cool looking which is the reason why I'm giving this a two out of ten. So, what's wrong with this movie? EVERYTHING! The story was too clich&eacute;d and predictable, the acting was so horrible, the writing is messed up, the dialogue was god-awful the action is way over the top and it also has poorly CGI quality effects. I think the music was OK, but nothing special. To be honest, I never watch the TV show this movie was based on, but given the horrible reception in this film, I would definitely watch it to keep me interested. Anyway, horrible movie. Avoid it.

    Let me just establish one thing: I am border-line obsessed with Gary Oldman. I think that he is hands down the greatest actor / human being (other than my mum) that the world has ever known. So, naturally, I have made a habit of buying every film of his if I happen to stumble upon it. that is how I came across "Lost in Space". I could tell right away just by looking at the cover that this was going to be yet another one of those cheesy, gaudy 90's sci-fi flicks, but it was $3.99 and it had Gary Oldman in it. Why not? Here is why not: This. Film. Is trash. False. A trash can would not even allow this crap to infect it with its filth. Now, I have never seen the TV series, but if the story line of this film is anything like it, than it's a mystery how it ever stayed on the air. It's just soggy with campy clich&eacute;s. The characters are not even half-baked, and are always making juvenile and completely incompetent one-liners that don't even fit in with the rest of the conversation. Okay. This needs its own paragraph just due to the sheer annoyance of it. That stupid stupid stupid space monkey. What is up with that lame freaking monkey? It's not cute. It's eyes are just . . . It's a pointless monkey. I hate the monkey. That is all. Now for the acting. Don't get me wrong. I love Matt Leblanc in "Friends". But I'm not sure anymore as to whether or not he can actually act. The whole time he's trying to be this Bruce Willis-esque macho man, but he just seems ridiculous in trying. William Hurt is kind of, for lack of a better word, meh. Same goes for Mimi Rogers and Heather Graham.Lacy Chabert - as far as acting talent goes in this film, there is none for Gretchen Wieners, bye. Jack Johnson was fine. Now, Gary Oldman - the reason that I forced myself to sit down in front of this crap for the full 2 hours of torture. Gary, you are a fantastic actor. The best of the best. There is nothing that you have done that is disappointing. But dear Lord in Heaven. Why oh why would you agree to playing a man named Dr. "Spider" Smith? The name alone should give you a red light signal. This is the lamest waste of a villain that the world has ever known. He's uncharismatic, unintelligent, has no chutzpah whatsoever, and doesn't appear to have any motives for his mindless actions. When his future self transforms into a spider, it's not creepy, it's not sad. It's just embarrassing. So so so very cheesy. GARY! PLEASE TELL ME YOU DID NOT READ THE SCRIPT BEFORE AGREEING TO PLAY THIS ONE. To his eternal credit, Mr. Oldman did his best to add some charm and humor to Zachary Smith. For instance, when he says "Yes. Yeees . . . I'm a doctor." I actually laughed a little. Not because the line is funny - none of the script is remotely amusing - but just the bizarrely creepy way he said it. (It's even funnier in the blooper reel when he pauses a bit afterwards before saying ". . . And a pervert". I think they should have kept that in.) Anyway, enough of this banter. Gary, I'm not mad at you, just please don't do this again. So, to sum up, PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS GARBAGE!!! even if you're a fan of Gary oldman - actually, ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of Gary Oldman, just stay away. Yes, he managed to make it slightly watchable, but just barely. If you have any self-respect, do not do what i did and waste a good $3.99 on this mistake of a "film" A very generous 1/10.

    There seems to be a bit of a fad in remaking old television shows, but then Hollywood will do anything to make a little bit of money. Lost in Space is based on the very old TV series and has been spruced up by the typical Hollywood glitz. I never really got into the original series and the movie didn't really reach my expectations. The situation is that the Earth is dying and Professor Robinson is going on a mission to travel to another planet and build a hypergate so that colonists may move to this new world. Unfortunately there is an organisation that wishes to halt this progress and instead colonise this world for themselves. They pay Doctor Smith (Gary Oldman) to sabotage the mission, and decide to kill him while he is on the ship. When the ship, the Jupiter 2, takes off, Doctor Smith is on board as well as a killer robot. There is no single plot in this movie as once one problem is solved another one arises. The ultimate goal is to either return home or to complete their mission but this is not addressed in the movie. It is left open so as to possibly bring out a sequel. The plot elements are developed from the beginning though so the movie is a bit predictable. There is a large emphasis placed on Will Robinson's time travel experiments and they also talk about how hyperspace engines will send you to a random place in the galaxy and thus are very unreliable. When they mentioned that I knew how they were going to become lost. This movie places emphasis more on family values and seems to be directed towards those of use who are or are planning on becoming fathers. Basically the moral is that our family is the most important part of our lives and we should put a lot of time into it. Professor Robinson wanted to head the mission but said that the only way he would do it is if his family came along. This is really selfish as it would have been far better if he did not marry and have a family so that he had no ties when he went gallivanting off over the galaxy. This idea is brought up. I guess they want to address the growing problem of families that are breaking apart. The family unit is no longer as solid as people believed that it was and the reason addressed in this movie is because we all pursue our own personal goals and not as a family.

    Incredibly bad storyline and continuity. A series of computer-generated story sequences strung together like a cheap necklace. It starts out well enough with a great opening sequence involving a crisis in space, then it quickly falls apart. Dr. Smith, always the villain, mutates into a giant bug! How can you fly through the sun? Time travel and the space-time continuum jumbled together at the finale in such a way that the whole thing makes even less sense than the puzzling ending to Disneys' "The Black Hole"! An annoying computer-generated pet monkey that hangs around sister "Penny's" neck and appears to have ADHD. Exhausting to watch. Sure not as much fun as the old silly Irwin Allen TV series. A total disappointment. One of the worst sci-fi movies of all time. So bad I was rootin' for the space spiders! I still love the robot, however. But he hasn't had any good lines since "Forbidden Planet".

    What have the following got in common? Disney's Black Hole, Alien, Aliens, Gremlins, The Thing (John Carpenter version), all Star Trek movies and TV episodes featuring technobabble and time travelling, the special effects in Dr Who, leading edge FX? The answer is that they have all been plagiarised or used in this film along with many other films and artefacts too numerous to mention. If you insist on going to see this film then you'd better resign yourself to the fact that every other scene will remind you of something else and that scenes of technical FX mastery will be followed by, or mixed with, scenes of such naffness that they would make the crew of Blake's 7 blush in embarrassment. I think there may have been a good film in there somewhere but it is too late for it ever to be reconstituted. The Robinson family, for it is they, get lost not only in space but also in time, not to mention lost in plot. Let's face it, apart from a very obvious thing that happens with Will Robinson, the plot is utterly incomprehensible. The Robinsons seem to be flung into the far reaches of time, space and plot by baddies with inscrutable plans, onto spaceships which may or may not have anything to do with the plot but look cool and have spiffy monsters, in periods of time which may be before after or sideways from the main timeline. Do not try to make sense of this if you value your mental health. Some good bits are; the casting is pretty effective, especially Gary Oldman, some of the FX are quite stunning, music and soundtrack are fine, things explode and go "whoosh" a lot, the robot is well cool and delivers some of the best acting in the film with the immortal "Danger Will Robinson, Danger!" So long as you let yourself go this is rather similar to the experience of taking hallucinatory drugs (allegedly) and of similar value.

    It's obvious the directors had no comprehension of the Space/Time continuum because this film defies it in so many ways. I say this mainly as the third act opens as Space Family Robinson are hurled decades into the future (at least 20 years I imagine but they don't specify this), where on a distant world they bump into their future selves. The main problem with this idea is that in order for them to bump into their older selves their older selves would have had to have been living on the planet for the past 20 years or so, whereas in the film they had just arrived, meaning they couldn't possibly live there. Also, Dr Smith kills his past self and yet his future self doesn't disappear, and young Will Robinson is killed in an explosion yet the future William doesn't disappear either. Apart from that the acting is as bland as cardboard as many of the characters have no defining character. Dr Smith is you're usual over the top bad guy (although my favourite part used to be when he had become his spider self, a character indulged in mystery but that's heading off track), John Robinson's character is unrealistically emotionless, Matt le Blanc is your average rough Space Cowboy type, the elder daughter is your typical hard-to-get type, the younger daughter is often considered to be the Missing Chipette and Will doesn't get enough credit for his amazing work, instead he gets bawled off by his siblings and his talent is only really exploited by the bad guy Dr. Smith, which leads to later character development but it would have needed to have been a longer more developed film, where rather than stumbling across their future selves, the film could have been a documentary of how the Robinson's struggled to survive on the harsh and unforgiving world and eventually another set of characters come across them leading to the events of the end of the film, etc, etc. Overall, a weak attempt at sci-fi with some OK CGI but not much else going for it...

    In the year 2058 Earth is suffering of pollution and will soon be uninhabitable after the irreversible effects of global warming. Space colony family struggles to survive when a spy/accidental stowaway throws their ship hopelessly off course. Professor John Robinson (William Hurt), his wife Maureen (Mimi Rogers) , their children Judy (Heather Graham) , Penny (Lacey Chabert) and Will (Jack Johnson) and Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc , Sean Patrick Flanery was originally cast and was also previously offered to Matthew Perry) are selected to go to the third planet in the Alpha Centauri star system to establish a colony so that other Earth people can settle there. They are to go there on a ship christened the Jupiter 2. However, Doctor Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman) , an agent for an enemy (Edward Fox) , is sent to sabotage the mission. He is successful in reprogramming the ship's robot, but in the process becomes trapped on the ship , the ship and all on board become hopelessly lost and it now becomes a fight for survival as the crew tries to find their way back home . Now they are fighting to live long enough to find a way home . Familiar Sci-Fi dealing with Robinson family was going into space to fight for a chance for humanity , it is plenty of special effects , thrills , action though regularly developed . The picture has some good moments here and there , but is also full of flaws and gaps . Screenplay by Akiva Goldsman who wrote a script with absurd situations and embarrassing scenes. Silly and ridiculous images , especially starred by the computer monkey made by means of botching effects and the giant spider-Doctor Smith too . Mediocre performances and all principals actors were contracted to a three picture option, but as the film failed to recoup its budget in North America, plans for a new franchise were scrapped . Good photography by cinematographer Peter Levy who frequently works with the filmmaker . Thrilling and atmospheric musical score by Bruce Broughton . The motion picture was middling directed by Stephen Hopkins who has realized some acceptable Sci-Fi and Terror films as &uml;Nightmare in ElmStreet 5 &uml; , &uml;Predator 2&uml;, &uml;The reaping &uml; , though his better films were &uml;The ghost and the darkness&uml; and &uml;The life and death of Peter Sellers&uml;. &uml;Lost in space&uml; turns out to be his worst movie . Rating : Below average . The classic and best version results to be 84 episodes for television produced by Irwin Allen , starred by Guy Williams (John Robinson) , June Lockhart ( Maureen Robinson) , Mark Goddard (Maj. Don West), Marta Kristen (Judy Robinson) , Bill Mumy ( Will Robinson) and Angela Cartwright . (Penny Robinson).Originally, all surviving cast members of the TV show were meant to have cameo appearances. Mark Goddard, the original Major Don West, plays the General. June Lockhart,plays Will Robinson's principal , Marta Kristen and Angela Cartwright play reporters and Dick Tufeld reprises his role from Lost in Space as the voice of the Robot. Ironically, Bill Mumy and Jonathan Harris, the two actors most supportive of the idea of a new movie , did not appear in it.

    I cannot believe all the wannabe movie critics ripping this movie apart. All of the negative reviews appear to be from people comparing it to the TV series. If there never was a TV series, they'd be lauding it's wonderful effects and story line, but they are so busy comparing it line-by-line to the original series, they can't get past it. Are you serious? You really wanted this movie to be anything like that crummy TV series? Get over it. The series laid a good plot line, but beyond that it was cheaply made and the scripts were so G-rated there was almost no story at all. And the character development in the series was plastic and phony, to the point of being non-existent, even for the 60's. I was a 9 year old boy when this series was first aired on TV, and when I watched it, the most fun I had was ripping it apart because of how fake it was. Even as a 9-year-old I could see that. Guys love to do this, and this is the show that taught me how to do it. Even so, I enjoyed it for what it was - SciFi on prime time. Now this updated movie actually does some character building and provides an interesting plot, and the history buffs can't stand it. There is a reason why LIS was canceled, and why so many SciFi prime time shows don't last long. People want to see the grit, the fire, the real people behind the characters, not some Hollywood plastic version. Because I didn't fall into the trap of comparing it with the original series, I loved this movie. It is SciFi at it's best. Good story, good character building, good back story on the plot and characters, great effects, twists, turns, action. This may be the most underrated SciFi movie of all time. Watch it without comparisons to the TV series, and you are guaranteed to enjoy.

    Those who have followed and been long time fans of Lost In Space (1965) TV series will be just as disappointed, as I was. What most everyone was looking for in seeing certainly wasn't a remake but a conclusion. Where the Robinson family & stowaway Dr. Smith would finally make it to the new Earth, Alpha Centauri...not Alpha Prime, for colonization. What was totally out of character was when John and Don got into a verbal fight and were disrespectful over who would lead the mission, including the obscene P word that Maureen used to set them straight. Also how Will and Penny were like from a dysfunctional family, where they didn't get along and were preoccupied with their own self-worths and what mattered to only them. Even, Don hitting on Judy as if she was something to conquer for the fulfillment of his ego wasn't right. Instead of giving the viewer something they didn't know about each character, the creators played off of what one already knows, combined with some kind of disrespect & immorality (which is the opposite of what the original characters were all about). While the latter is what most of real society appears to be like today, there are still good, decent people in the world. So why patronize bad for good? I thought it was a joke when they used a bald man during the launch for Alpha Control. During the launch, when we saw how the likeness of the original Jupiter 2 , as Jupiter 1, was blown off, like some temporary booster fuselage, with a new Jupiter 2 design emerging (butterfly effect of coming out of a cocoon), it was as though the creators were saying "Out with the old and in with the new."

Yes, he managed to make it slightly watchable, but just barely. If you have any self-respect, do not do what i did and waste a good $3.99 on this mistake of a "film" A very generous 1/10.

    There seems to be a bit of a fad in remaking old television shows, but then Hollywood will do anything to make a little bit of money. Lost in Space is based on the very old TV series and has been spruced up by the typical Hollywood glitz. I never really got into the original series and the movie didn't really reach my expectations. The situation is that the Earth is dying and Professor Robinson is going on a mission to travel to another planet and build a hypergate so that colonists may move to this new world. Unfortunately there is an organisation that wishes to halt this progress and instead colonise this world for themselves. They pay Doctor Smith (Gary Oldman) to sabotage the mission, and decide to kill him while he is on the ship. When the ship, the Jupiter 2, takes off, Doctor Smith is on board as well as a killer robot. There is no single plot in this movie as once one problem is solved another one arises. The ultimate goal is to either return home or to complete their mission but this is not addressed in the movie. It is left open so as to possibly bring out a sequel. The plot elements are developed from the beginning though so the movie is a bit predictable. There is a large emphasis placed on Will Robinson's time travel experiments and they also talk about how hyperspace engines will send you to a random place in the galaxy and thus are very unreliable. When they mentioned that I knew how they were going to become lost. This movie places emphasis more on family values and seems to be directed towards those of use who are or are planning on becoming fathers. Basically the moral is that our family is the most important part of our lives and we should put a lot of time into it. Professor Robinson wanted to head the mission but said that the only way he would do it is if his family came along. This is really selfish as it would have been far better if he did not marry and have a family so that he had no ties when he went gallivanting off over the galaxy. This idea is brought up. I guess they want to address the growing problem of families that are breaking apart. The family unit is no longer as solid as people believed that it was and the reason addressed in this movie is because we all pursue our own personal goals and not as a family.

    Incredibly bad storyline and continuity. A series of computer-generated story sequences strung together like a cheap necklace. It starts out well enough with a great opening sequence involving a crisis in space, then it quickly falls apart. Dr. Smith, always the villain, mutates into a giant bug! How can you fly through the sun? Time travel and the space-time continuum jumbled together at the finale in such a way that the whole thing makes even less sense than the puzzling ending to Disneys' "The Black Hole"! An annoying computer-generated pet monkey that hangs around sister "Penny's" neck and appears to have ADHD. Exhausting to watch. Sure not as much fun as the old silly Irwin Allen TV series. A total disappointment. One of the worst sci-fi movies of all time. So bad I was rootin' for the space spiders! I still love the robot, however. But he hasn't had any good lines since "Forbidden Planet".

    What have the following got in common? Disney's Black Hole, Alien, Aliens, Gremlins, The Thing (John Carpenter version), all Star Trek movies and TV episodes featuring technobabble and time travelling, the special effects in Dr Who, leading edge FX? The answer is that they have all been plagiarised or used in this film along with many other films and artefacts too numerous to mention. If you insist on going to see this film then you'd better resign yourself to the fact that every other scene will remind you of something else and that scenes of technical FX mastery will be followed by, or mixed with, scenes of such naffness that they would make the crew of Blake's 7 blush in embarrassment. I think there may have been a good film in there somewhere but it is too late for it ever to be reconstituted. The Robinson family, for it is they, get lost not only in space but also in time, not to mention lost in plot. Let's face it, apart from a very obvious thing that happens with Will Robinson, the plot is utterly incomprehensible. The Robinsons seem to be flung into the far reaches of time, space and plot by baddies with inscrutable plans, onto spaceships which may or may not have anything to do with the plot but look cool and have spiffy monsters, in periods of time which may be before after or sideways from the main timeline. Do not try to make sense of this if you value your mental health. Some good bits are; the casting is pretty effective, especially Gary Oldman, some of the FX are quite stunning, music and soundtrack are fine, things explode and go "whoosh" a lot, the robot is well cool and delivers some of the best acting in the film with the immortal "Danger Will Robinson, Danger!" So long as you let yourself go this is rather similar to the experience of taking hallucinatory drugs (allegedly) and of similar value.

    It's obvious the directors had no comprehension of the Space/Time continuum because this film defies it in so many ways. I say this mainly as the third act opens as Space Family Robinson are hurled decades into the future (at least 20 years I imagine but they don't specify this), where on a distant world they bump into their future selves. The main problem with this idea is that in order for them to bump into their older selves their older selves would have had to have been living on the planet for the past 20 years or so, whereas in the film they had just arrived, meaning they couldn't possibly live there. Also, Dr Smith kills his past self and yet his future self doesn't disappear, and young Will Robinson is killed in an explosion yet the future William doesn't disappear either. Apart from that the acting is as bland as cardboard as many of the characters have no defining character. Dr Smith is you're usual over the top bad guy (although my favourite part used to be when he had become his spider self, a character indulged in mystery but that's heading off track), John Robinson's character is unrealistically emotionless, Matt le Blanc is your average rough Space Cowboy type, the elder daughter is your typical hard-to-get type, the younger daughter is often considered to be the Missing Chipette and Will doesn't get enough credit for his amazing work, instead he gets bawled off by his siblings and his talent is only really exploited by the bad guy Dr. Smith, which leads to later character development but it would have needed to have been a longer more developed film, where rather than stumbling across their future selves, the film could have been a documentary of how the Robinson's struggled to survive on the harsh and unforgiving world and eventually another set of characters come across them leading to the events of the end of the film, etc, etc. Overall, a weak attempt at sci-fi with some OK CGI but not much else going for it...

    In the year 2058 Earth is suffering of pollution and will soon be uninhabitable after the irreversible effects of global warming. Space colony family struggles to survive when a spy/accidental stowaway throws their ship hopelessly off course. Professor John Robinson (William Hurt), his wife Maureen (Mimi Rogers) , their children Judy (Heather Graham) , Penny (Lacey Chabert) and Will (Jack Johnson) and Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc , Sean Patrick Flanery was originally cast and was also previously offered to Matthew Perry) are selected to go to the third planet in the Alpha Centauri star system to establish a colony so that other Earth people can settle there. They are to go there on a ship christened the Jupiter 2. However, Doctor Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman) , an agent for an enemy (Edward Fox) , is sent to sabotage the mission. He is successful in reprogramming the ship's robot, but in the process becomes trapped on the ship , the ship and all on board become hopelessly lost and it now becomes a fight for survival as the crew tries to find their way back home . Now they are fighting to live long enough to find a way home . Familiar Sci-Fi dealing with Robinson family was going into space to fight for a chance for humanity , it is plenty of special effects , thrills , action though regularly developed . The picture has some good moments here and there , but is also full of flaws and gaps . Screenplay by Akiva Goldsman who wrote a script with absurd situations and embarrassing scenes. Silly and ridiculous images , especially starred by the computer monkey made by means of botching effects and the giant spider-Doctor Smith too . Mediocre performances and all principals actors were contracted to a three picture option, but as the film failed to recoup its budget in North America, plans for a new franchise were scrapped . Good photography by cinematographer Peter Levy who frequently works with the filmmaker . Thrilling and atmospheric musical score by Bruce Broughton . The motion picture was middling directed by Stephen Hopkins who has realized some acceptable Sci-Fi and Terror films as &uml;Nightmare in ElmStreet 5 &uml; , &uml;Predator 2&uml;, &uml;The reaping &uml; , though his better films were &uml;The ghost and the darkness&uml; and &uml;The life and death of Peter Sellers&uml;. &uml;Lost in space&uml; turns out to be his worst movie . Rating : Below average . The classic and best version results to be 84 episodes for television produced by Irwin Allen , starred by Guy Williams (John Robinson) , June Lockhart ( Maureen Robinson) , Mark Goddard (Maj. Don West), Marta Kristen (Judy Robinson) , Bill Mumy ( Will Robinson) and Angela Cartwright . (Penny Robinson).Originally, all surviving cast members of the TV show were meant to have cameo appearances. Mark Goddard, the original Major Don West, plays the General. June Lockhart,plays Will Robinson's principal , Marta Kristen and Angela Cartwright play reporters and Dick Tufeld reprises his role from Lost in Space as the voice of the Robot. Ironically, Bill Mumy and Jonathan Harris, the two actors most supportive of the idea of a new movie , did not appear in it.

    I cannot believe all the wannabe movie critics ripping this movie apart. All of the negative reviews appear to be from people comparing it to the TV series. If there never was a TV series, they'd be lauding it's wonderful effects and story line, but they are so busy comparing it line-by-line to the original series, they can't get past it. Are you serious? You really wanted this movie to be anything like that crummy TV series? Get over it. The series laid a good plot line, but beyond that it was cheaply made and the scripts were so G-rated there was almost no story at all. And the character development in the series was plastic and phony, to the point of being non-existent, even for the 60's. I was a 9 year old boy when this series was first aired on TV, and when I watched it, the most fun I had was ripping it apart because of how fake it was. Even as a 9-year-old I could see that. Guys love to do this, and this is the show that taught me how to do it. Even so, I enjoyed it for what it was - SciFi on prime time. Now this updated movie actually does some character building and provides an interesting plot, and the history buffs can't stand it. There is a reason why LIS was canceled, and why so many SciFi prime time shows don't last long. People want to see the grit, the fire, the real people behind the characters, not some Hollywood plastic version. Because I didn't fall into the trap of comparing it with the original series, I loved this movie. It is SciFi at it's best. Good story, good character building, good back story on the plot and characters, great effects, twists, turns, action. This may be the most underrated SciFi movie of all time. Watch it without comparisons to the TV series, and you are guaranteed to enjoy.

    Those who have followed and been long time fans of Lost In Space (1965) TV series will be just as disappointed, as I was. What most everyone was looking for in seeing certainly wasn't a remake but a conclusion. Where the Robinson family & stowaway Dr. Smith would finally make it to the new Earth, Alpha Centauri...not Alpha Prime, for colonization. What was totally out of character was when John and Don got into a verbal fight and were disrespectful over who would lead the mission, including the obscene P word that Maureen used to set them straight. Also how Will and Penny were like from a dysfunctional family, where they didn't get along and were preoccupied with their own self-worths and what mattered to only them. Even, Don hitting on Judy as if she was something to conquer for the fulfillment of his ego wasn't right. Instead of giving the viewer something they didn't know about each character, the creators played off of what one already knows, combined with some kind of disrespect & immorality (which is the opposite of what the original characters were all about). While the latter is what most of real society appears to be like today, there are still good, decent people in the world. So why patronize bad for good? I thought it was a joke when they used a bald man during the launch for Alpha Control. During the launch, when we saw how the likeness of the original Jupiter 2 , as Jupiter 1, was blown off, like some temporary booster fuselage, with a new Jupiter 2 design emerging (butterfly effect of coming out of a cocoon), it was as though the creators were saying "Out with the old and in with the new." Even the short cameo appearance of the original cast bothered me to no end, as I felt they were taken badly advantage of, as filmsy attempt to gain long time LIS fans favor. When we were all looking forward to seeing our favorites as they are today. With the unfortunate loss of Guy Williams, the creators still could of used the original cast members. All they would of had to to is put Williams in much like how The Crow, City of Angels (1996) was done to fill in for Brandon Lee. Or they could of resorted to like Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001) used total computer generated characters. Lastly, they could of done a nation wide search for someone who looks exactly like Guy Williams to be Professor John Robinson. Those who were not accepted or were convincing as the characters they portrayed is William Hurt as Prof. Robinson, Jack Johnson as Will and Jared Harris as the older Will. Gary Oldman as Dr. Smith was OK but they could of done better. The boy who in a Campbell's Soup commercial that came in out of the cold and melted his snowman appearance away, I felt would of been a better choice for Will Robinson than someone who looked too much like the Space Monkey. Another thumbs down is the older Will didn't even so much resemble the younger Will. Another bad thing thing that can't be ignored is when did John Robinson have blondish looking hair? The only things I could say was good about the movie was the futuristic designs, special effects and why it was vitally important that the Robinson family make it to pioneer in the colonization of a new planet with earth-like conditions.

    I am relatively sure they were hoping to do a sequel or two for this film, however no sequels were ever forthcoming and this film is pretty much a forgotten film of the 90's whose main claim to fame is the fact it knocked off Titanic from the number one spot at the movies. That does not mean your film is good, I do believe all the guys got together and said to themselves "This looks tolerable" and they poured into theaters just to sink the ship. I am surprised the score is so low here, granted the score I am giving it is not much higher, but I have to say some of the visuals were quite good and there were some interesting things going on in this movie. Just way to much in the plot, it went here and there and crammed a whole lot of stuff in the film making it a bit to long and to jumbled. The film is about a family that gets lost in space thanks to the dastardly Dr. Smith played by Gary Oldman who is the only really interesting character in the film. Everyone else is bland with the exception of Matt LeBlanc who is just horribly miscast in an action type role which he neither has the acting ability or looks to do. The best thing about this film is the effects as the are very good, especially considering when this film was made. It just needed a whole lot of work on the plot, a bit of simplifying rather than the "let's throw it all in" approach they seemed to take with this one. Still, it did knock out Titanic, before it quickly sank into obscurity.

    First, let me point out two saving graces for this movie. Gary Oldman's performance was very entertaining and the visuals are very cool looking which is the reason why I'm giving this a two out of ten. So, what's wrong with this movie? EVERYTHING! The story was too clich&eacute;d and predictable, the acting was so horrible, the writing is messed up, the dialogue was god-awful the action is way over the top and it also has poorly CGI quality effects. I think the music was OK, but nothing special. To be honest, I never watch the TV show this movie was based on, but given the horrible reception in this film, I would definitely watch it to keep me interested. Anyway, horrible movie. Avoid it.

    Let me just establish one thing: I am border-line obsessed with Gary Oldman. I think that he is hands down the greatest actor / human being (other than my mum) that the world has ever known. So, naturally, I have made a habit of buying every film of his if I happen to stumble upon it. that is how I came across "Lost in Space". I could tell right away just by looking at the cover that this was going to be yet another one of those cheesy, gaudy 90's sci-fi flicks, but it was $3.99 and it had Gary Oldman in it. Why not? Here is why not: This. Film. Is trash. False. A trash can would not even allow this crap to infect it with its filth. Now, I have never seen the TV series, but if the story line of this film is anything like it, than it's a mystery how it ever stayed on the air. It's just soggy with campy clich&eacute;s. The characters are not even half-baked, and are always making juvenile and completely incompetent one-liners that don't even fit in with the rest of the conversation. Okay. This needs its own paragraph just due to the sheer annoyance of it. That stupid stupid stupid space monkey. What is up with that lame freaking monkey? It's not cute. It's eyes are just . . . It's a pointless monkey. I hate the monkey. That is all. Now for the acting. Don't get me wrong. I love Matt Leblanc in "Friends". But I'm not sure anymore as to whether or not he can actually act. The whole time he's trying to be this Bruce Willis-esque macho man, but he just seems ridiculous in trying. William Hurt is kind of, for lack of a better word, meh. Same goes for Mimi Rogers and Heather Graham.Lacy Chabert - as far as acting talent goes in this film, there is none for Gretchen Wieners, bye. Jack Johnson was fine. Now, Gary Oldman - the reason that I forced myself to sit down in front of this crap for the full 2 hours of torture. Gary, you are a fantastic actor. The best of the best. There is nothing that you have done that is disappointing. But dear Lord in Heaven. Why oh why would you agree to playing a man named Dr. "Spider" Smith? The name alone should give you a red light signal. This is the lamest waste of a villain that the world has ever known. He's uncharismatic, unintelligent, has no chutzpah whatsoever, and doesn't appear to have any motives for his mindless actions. When his future self transforms into a spider, it's not creepy, it's not sad. It's just embarrassing. So so so very cheesy. GARY! PLEASE TELL ME YOU DID NOT READ THE SCRIPT BEFORE AGREEING TO PLAY THIS ONE. To his eternal credit, Mr. Oldman did his best to add some charm and humor to Zachary Smith. For instance, when he says "Yes. Yeees . . . I'm a doctor." I actually laughed a little. Not because the line is funny - none of the script is remotely amusing - but just the bizarrely creepy way he said it. (It's even funnier in the blooper reel when he pauses a bit afterwards before saying ". . . And a pervert". I think they should have kept that in.) Anyway, enough of this banter. Gary, I'm not mad at you, just please don't do this again. So, to sum up, PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS GARBAGE!!! even if you're a fan of Gary oldman - actually, ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of Gary Oldman, just stay away. Yes, he managed to make it slightly watchable, but just barely. If you have any self-respect, do not do what i did and waste a good $3.99 on this mistake of a "film" A very generous 1/10.

    I cannot believe all the wannabe movie critics ripping this movie apart. All of the negative reviews appear to be from people comparing it to the TV series. If there never was a TV series, they'd be lauding it's wonderful effects and story line, but they are so busy comparing it line-by-line to the original series, they can't get past it. Are you serious? You really wanted this movie to be anything like that crummy TV series? Get over it. The series laid a good plot line, but beyond that it was cheaply made and the scripts were so G-rated there was almost no story at all. And the character development in the series was plastic and phony, to the point of being non-existent, even for the 60's. I was a 9 year old boy when this series was first aired on TV, and when I watched it, the most fun I had was ripping it apart because of how fake it was. Even as a 9-year-old I could see that. Guys love to do this, and this is the show that taught me how to do it. Even so, I enjoyed it for what it was - SciFi on prime time. Now this updated movie actually does some character building and provides an interesting plot, and the history buffs can't stand it. There is a reason why LIS was canceled, and why so many SciFi prime time shows don't last long. People want to see the grit, the fire, the real people behind the characters, not some Hollywood plastic version. Because I didn't fall into the trap of comparing it with the original series, I loved this movie. It is SciFi at it's best. Good story, good character building, good back story on the plot and characters, great effects, twists, turns, action. This may be the most underrated SciFi movie of all time. Watch it without comparisons to the TV series, and you are guaranteed to enjoy.

    Those who have followed and been long time fans of Lost In Space (1965) TV series will be just as disappointed, as I was. What most everyone was looking for in seeing certainly wasn't a remake but a conclusion. Where the Robinson family & stowaway Dr. Smith would finally make it to the new Earth, Alpha Centauri...not Alpha Prime, for colonization. What was totally out of character was when John and Don got into a verbal fight and were disrespectful over who would lead the mission, including the obscene P word that Maureen used to set them straight. Also how Will and Penny were like from a dysfunctional family, where they didn't get along and were preoccupied with their own self-worths and what mattered to only them. Even, Don hitting on Judy as if she was something to conquer for the fulfillment of his ego wasn't right. Instead of giving the viewer something they didn't know about each character, the creators played off of what one already knows, combined with some kind of disrespect & immorality (which is the opposite of what the original characters were all about). While the latter is what most of real society appears to be like today, there are still good, decent people in the world. So why patronize bad for good? I thought it was a joke when they used a bald man during the launch for Alpha Control. During the launch, when we saw how the likeness of the original Jupiter 2 , as Jupiter 1, was blown off, like some temporary booster fuselage, with a new Jupiter 2 design emerging (butterfly effect of coming out of a cocoon), it was as though the creators were saying "Out with the old and in with the new." Even the short cameo appearance of the original cast bothered me to no end, as I felt they were taken badly advantage of, as filmsy attempt to gain long time LIS fans favor. When we were all looking forward to seeing our favorites as they are today. With the unfortunate loss of Guy Williams, the creators still could of used the original cast members. All they would of had to to is put Williams in much like how The Crow, City of Angels (1996) was done to fill in for Brandon Lee. Or they could of resorted to like Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001) used total computer generated characters. Lastly, they could of done a nation wide search for someone who looks exactly like Guy Williams to be Professor John Robinson. Those who were not accepted or were convincing as the characters they portrayed is William Hurt as Prof. Robinson, Jack Johnson as Will and Jared Harris as the older Will. Gary Oldman as Dr. Smith was OK but they could of done better. The boy who in a Campbell's Soup commercial that came in out of the cold and melted his snowman appearance away, I felt would of been a better choice for Will Robinson than someone who looked too much like the Space Monkey. Another thumbs down is the older Will didn't even so much resemble the younger Will. Another bad thing thing that can't be ignored is when did John Robinson have blondish looking hair? The only things I could say was good about the movie was the futuristic designs, special effects and why it was vitally important that the Robinson family make it to pioneer in the colonization of a new planet with earth-like conditions.

    I am relatively sure they were hoping to do a sequel or two for this film, however no sequels were ever forthcoming and this film is pretty much a forgotten film of the 90's whose main claim to fame is the fact it knocked off Titanic from the number one spot at the movies. That does not mean your film is good, I do believe all the guys got together and said to themselves "This looks tolerable" and they poured into theaters just to sink the ship. I am surprised the score is so low here, granted the score I am giving it is not much higher, but I have to say some of the visuals were quite good and there were some interesting things going on in this movie. Just way to much in the plot, it went here and there and crammed a whole lot of stuff in the film making it a bit to long and to jumbled. The film is about a family that gets lost in space thanks to the dastardly Dr. Smith played by Gary Oldman who is the only really interesting character in the film. Everyone else is bland with the exception of Matt LeBlanc who is just horribly miscast in an action type role which he neither has the acting ability or looks to do. The best thing about this film is the effects as the are very good, especially considering when this film was made. It just needed a whole lot of work on the plot, a bit of simplifying rather than the "let's throw it all in" approach they seemed to take with this one. Still, it did knock out Titanic, before it quickly sank into obscurity.

    First, let me point out two saving graces for this movie. Gary Oldman's performance was very entertaining and the visuals are very cool looking which is the reason why I'm giving this a two out of ten. So, what's wrong with this movie? EVERYTHING! The story was too clich&eacute;d and predictable, the acting was so horrible, the writing is messed up, the dialogue was god-awful the action is way over the top and it also has poorly CGI quality effects. I think the music was OK, but nothing special. To be honest, I never watch the TV show this movie was based on, but given the horrible reception in this film, I would definitely watch it to keep me interested. Anyway, horrible movie. Avoid it.

    Let me just establish one thing: I am border-line obsessed with Gary Oldman. I think that he is hands down the greatest actor / human being (other than my mum) that the world has ever known. So, naturally, I have made a habit of buying every film of his if I happen to stumble upon it. that is how I came across "Lost in Space". I could tell right away just by looking at the cover that this was going to be yet another one of those cheesy, gaudy 90's sci-fi flicks, but it was $3.99 and it had Gary Oldman in it. Why not? Here is why not: This. Film. Is trash. False. A trash can would not even allow this crap to infect it with its filth. Now, I have never seen the TV series, but if the story line of this film is anything like it, than it's a mystery how it ever stayed on the air. It's just soggy with campy clich&eacute;s. The characters are not even half-baked, and are always making juvenile and completely incompetent one-liners that don't even fit in with the rest of the conversation. Okay. This needs its own paragraph just due to the sheer annoyance of it. That stupid stupid stupid space monkey. What is up with that lame freaking monkey? It's not cute. It's eyes are just . . . It's a pointless monkey. I hate the monkey. That is all. Now for the acting. Don't get me wrong. I love Matt Leblanc in "Friends". But I'm not sure anymore as to whether or not he can actually act. The whole time he's trying to be this Bruce Willis-esque macho man, but he just seems ridiculous in trying. William Hurt is kind of, for lack of a better word, meh. Same goes for Mimi Rogers and Heather Graham.Lacy Chabert - as far as acting talent goes in this film, there is none for Gretchen Wieners, bye. Jack Johnson was fine. Now, Gary Oldman - the reason that I forced myself to sit down in front of this crap for the full 2 hours of torture. Gary, you are a fantastic actor. The best of the best. There is nothing that you have done that is disappointing. But dear Lord in Heaven. Why oh why would you agree to playing a man named Dr. "Spider" Smith? The name alone should give you a red light signal. This is the lamest waste of a villain that the world has ever known. He's uncharismatic, unintelligent, has no chutzpah whatsoever, and doesn't appear to have any motives for his mindless actions. When his future self transforms into a spider, it's not creepy, it's not sad. It's just embarrassing. So so so very cheesy. GARY! PLEASE TELL ME YOU DID NOT READ THE SCRIPT BEFORE AGREEING TO PLAY THIS ONE. To his eternal credit, Mr. Oldman did his best to add some charm and humor to Zachary Smith. For instance, when he says "Yes. Yeees . . . I'm a doctor." I actually laughed a little. Not because the line is funny - none of the script is remotely amusing - but just the bizarrely creepy way he said it. (It's even funnier in the blooper reel when he pauses a bit afterwards before saying ". . . And a pervert". I think they should have kept that in.) Anyway, enough of this banter. Gary, I'm not mad at you, just please don't do this again. So, to sum up, PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS GARBAGE!!! even if you're a fan of Gary oldman - actually, ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of Gary Oldman, just stay away. Yes, he managed to make it slightly watchable, but just barely. If you have any self-respect, do not do what i did and waste a good $3.99 on this mistake of a "film" A very generous 1/10.

    There seems to be a bit of a fad in remaking old television shows, but then Hollywood will do anything to make a little bit of money. Lost in Space is based on the very old TV series and has been spruced up by the typical Hollywood glitz. I never really got into the original series and the movie didn't really reach my expectations. The situation is that the Earth is dying and Professor Robinson is going on a mission to travel to another planet and build a hypergate so that colonists may move to this new world. Unfortunately there is an organisation that wishes to halt this progress and instead colonise this world for themselves. They pay Doctor Smith (Gary Oldman) to sabotage the mission, and decide to kill him while he is on the ship. When the ship, the Jupiter 2, takes off, Doctor Smith is on board as well as a killer robot. There is no single plot in this movie as once one problem is solved another one arises. The ultimate goal is to either return home or to complete their mission but this is not addressed in the movie. It is left open so as to possibly bring out a sequel. The plot elements are developed from the beginning though so the movie is a bit predictable. There is a large emphasis placed on Will Robinson's time travel experiments and they also talk about how hyperspace engines will send you to a random place in the galaxy and thus are very unreliable. When they mentioned that I knew how they were going to become lost. This movie places emphasis more on family values and seems to be directed towards those of use who are or are planning on becoming fathers. Basically the moral is that our family is the most important part of our lives and we should put a lot of time into it. Professor Robinson wanted to head the mission but said that the only way he would do it is if his family came along. This is really selfish as it would have been far better if he did not marry and have a family so that he had no ties when he went gallivanting off over the galaxy. This idea is brought up. I guess they want to address the growing problem of families that are breaking apart. The family unit is no longer as solid as people believed that it was and the reason addressed in this movie is because we all pursue our own personal goals and not as a family.

    Incredibly bad storyline and continuity. A series of computer-generated story sequences strung together like a cheap necklace. It starts out well enough with a great opening sequence involving a crisis in space, then it quickly falls apart. Dr. Smith, always the villain, mutates into a giant bug! How can you fly through the sun? Time travel and the space-time continuum jumbled together at the finale in such a way that the whole thing makes even less sense than the puzzling ending to Disneys' "The Black Hole"! An annoying computer-generated pet monkey that hangs around sister "Penny's" neck and appears to have ADHD. Exhausting to watch. Sure not as much fun as the old silly Irwin Allen TV series. A total disappointment. One of the worst sci-fi movies of all time. So bad I was rootin' for the space spiders! I still love the robot, however. But he hasn't had any good lines since "Forbidden Planet".

    What have the following got in common? Disney's Black Hole, Alien, Aliens, Gremlins, The Thing (John Carpenter version), all Star Trek movies and TV episodes featuring technobabble and time travelling, the special effects in Dr Who, leading edge FX? The answer is that they have all been plagiarised or used in this film along with many other films and artefacts too numerous to mention. If you insist on going to see this film then you'd better resign yourself to the fact that every other scene will remind you of something else and that scenes of technical FX mastery will be followed by, or mixed with, scenes of such naffness that they would make the crew of Blake's 7 blush in embarrassment. I think there may have been a good film in there somewhere but it is too late for it ever to be reconstituted. The Robinson family, for it is they, get lost not only in space but also in time, not to mention lost in plot. Let's face it, apart from a very obvious thing that happens with Will Robinson, the plot is utterly incomprehensible. The Robinsons seem to be flung into the far reaches of time, space and plot by baddies with inscrutable plans, onto spaceships which may or may not have anything to do with the plot but look cool and have spiffy monsters, in periods of time which may be before after or sideways from the main timeline. Do not try to make sense of this if you value your mental health. Some good bits are; the casting is pretty effective, especially Gary Oldman, some of the FX are quite stunning, music and soundtrack are fine, things explode and go "whoosh" a lot, the robot is well cool and delivers some of the best acting in the film with the immortal "Danger Will Robinson, Danger!" So long as you let yourself go this is rather similar to the experience of taking hallucinatory drugs (allegedly) and of similar value.

    It's obvious the directors had no comprehension of the Space/Time continuum because this film defies it in so many ways. I say this mainly as the third act opens as Space Family Robinson are hurled decades into the future (at least 20 years I imagine but they don't specify this), where on a distant world they bump into their future selves. The main problem with this idea is that in order for them to bump into their older selves their older selves would have had to have been living on the planet for the past 20 years or so, whereas in the film they had just arrived, meaning they couldn't possibly live there. Also, Dr Smith kills his past self and yet his future self doesn't disappear, and young Will Robinson is killed in an explosion yet the future William doesn't disappear either. Apart from that the acting is as bland as cardboard as many of the characters have no defining character. Dr Smith is you're usual over the top bad guy (although my favourite part used to be when he had become his spider self, a character indulged in mystery but that's heading off track), John Robinson's character is unrealistically emotionless, Matt le Blanc is your average rough Space Cowboy type, the elder daughter is your typical hard-to-get type, the younger daughter is often considered to be the Missing Chipette and Will doesn't get enough credit for his amazing work, instead he gets bawled off by his siblings and his talent is only really exploited by the bad guy Dr. Smith, which leads to later character development but it would have needed to have been a longer more developed film, where rather than stumbling across their future selves, the film could have been a documentary of how the Robinson's struggled to survive on the harsh and unforgiving world and eventually another set of characters come across them leading to the events of the end of the film, etc, etc. Overall, a weak attempt at sci-fi with some OK CGI but not much else going for it...

    I am relatively sure they were hoping to do a sequel or two for this film, however no sequels were ever forthcoming and this film is pretty much a forgotten film of the 90's whose main claim to fame is the fact it knocked off Titanic from the number one spot at the movies. That does not mean your film is good, I do believe all the guys got together and said to themselves "This looks tolerable" and they poured into theaters just to sink the ship. I am surprised the score is so low here, granted the score I am giving it is not much higher, but I have to say some of the visuals were quite good and there were some interesting things going on in this movie. Just way to much in the plot, it went here and there and crammed a whole lot of stuff in the film making it a bit to long and to jumbled. The film is about a family that gets lost in space thanks to the dastardly Dr. Smith played by Gary Oldman who is the only really interesting character in the film. Everyone else is bland with the exception of Matt LeBlanc who is just horribly miscast in an action type role which he neither has the acting ability or looks to do. The best thing about this film is the effects as the are very good, especially considering when this film was made. It just needed a whole lot of work on the plot, a bit of simplifying rather than the "let's throw it all in" approach they seemed to take with this one. Still, it did knock out Titanic, before it quickly sank into obscurity.

    First, let me point out two saving graces for this movie. Gary Oldman's performance was very entertaining and the visuals are very cool looking which is the reason why I'm giving this a two out of ten. So, what's wrong with this movie? EVERYTHING! The story was too clich&eacute;d and predictable, the acting was so horrible, the writing is messed up, the dialogue was god-awful the action is way over the top and it also has poorly CGI quality effects. I think the music was OK, but nothing special. To be honest, I never watch the TV show this movie was based on, but given the horrible reception in this film, I would definitely watch it to keep me interested. Anyway, horrible movie. Avoid it.

    Let me just establish one thing: I am border-line obsessed with Gary Oldman. I think that he is hands down the greatest actor / human being (other than my mum) that the world has ever known. So, naturally, I have made a habit of buying every film of his if I happen to stumble upon it. that is how I came across "Lost in Space". I could tell right away just by looking at the cover that this was going to be yet another one of those cheesy, gaudy 90's sci-fi flicks, but it was $3.99 and it had Gary Oldman in it. Why not? Here is why not: This. Film. Is trash. False. A trash can would not even allow this crap to infect it with its filth. Now, I have never seen the TV series, but if the story line of this film is anything like it, than it's a mystery how it ever stayed on the air. It's just soggy with campy clich&eacute;s. The characters are not even half-baked, and are always making juvenile and completely incompetent one-liners that don't even fit in with the rest of the conversation. Okay. This needs its own paragraph just due to the sheer annoyance of it. That stupid stupid stupid space monkey. What is up with that lame freaking monkey? It's not cute. It's eyes are just . . . It's a pointless monkey. I hate the monkey. That is all. Now for the acting. Don't get me wrong. I love Matt Leblanc in "Friends". But I'm not sure anymore as to whether or not he can actually act. The whole time he's trying to be this Bruce Willis-esque macho man, but he just seems ridiculous in trying. William Hurt is kind of, for lack of a better word, meh. Same goes for Mimi Rogers and Heather Graham.Lacy Chabert - as far as acting talent goes in this film, there is none for Gretchen Wieners, bye. Jack Johnson was fine. Now, Gary Oldman - the reason that I forced myself to sit down in front of this crap for the full 2 hours of torture. Gary, you are a fantastic actor. The best of the best. There is nothing that you have done that is disappointing. But dear Lord in Heaven. Why oh why would you agree to playing a man named Dr. "Spider" Smith? The name alone should give you a red light signal. This is the lamest waste of a villain that the world has ever known. He's uncharismatic, unintelligent, has no chutzpah whatsoever, and doesn't appear to have any motives for his mindless actions. When his future self transforms into a spider, it's not creepy, it's not sad. It's just embarrassing. So so so very cheesy. GARY! PLEASE TELL ME YOU DID NOT READ THE SCRIPT BEFORE AGREEING TO PLAY THIS ONE. To his eternal credit, Mr. Oldman did his best to add some charm and humor to Zachary Smith. For instance, when he says "Yes. Yeees . . . I'm a doctor." I actually laughed a little. Not because the line is funny - none of the script is remotely amusing - but just the bizarrely creepy way he said it. (It's even funnier in the blooper reel when he pauses a bit afterwards before saying ". . . And a pervert". I think they should have kept that in.) Anyway, enough of this banter. Gary, I'm not mad at you, just please don't do this again. So, to sum up, PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS GARBAGE!!! even if you're a fan of Gary oldman - actually, ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of Gary Oldman, just stay away. Yes, he managed to make it slightly watchable, but just barely. If you have any self-respect, do not do what i did and waste a good $3.99 on this mistake of a "film" A very generous 1/10.

    There seems to be a bit of a fad in remaking old television shows, but then Hollywood will do anything to make a little bit of money. Lost in Space is based on the very old TV series and has been spruced up by the typical Hollywood glitz. I never really got into the original series and the movie didn't really reach my expectations. The situation is that the Earth is dying and Professor Robinson is going on a mission to travel to another planet and build a hypergate so that colonists may move to this new world. Unfortunately there is an organisation that wishes to halt this progress and instead colonise this world for themselves. They pay Doctor Smith (Gary Oldman) to sabotage the mission, and decide to kill him while he is on the ship. When the ship, the Jupiter 2, takes off, Doctor Smith is on board as well as a killer robot. There is no single plot in this movie as once one problem is solved another one arises. The ultimate goal is to either return home or to complete their mission but this is not addressed in the movie. It is left open so as to possibly bring out a sequel. The plot elements are developed from the beginning though so the movie is a bit predictable. There is a large emphasis placed on Will Robinson's time travel experiments and they also talk about how hyperspace engines will send you to a random place in the galaxy and thus are very unreliable. When they mentioned that I knew how they were going to become lost. This movie places emphasis more on family values and seems to be directed towards those of use who are or are planning on becoming fathers. Basically the moral is that our family is the most important part of our lives and we should put a lot of time into it. Professor Robinson wanted to head the mission but said that the only way he would do it is if his family came along. This is really selfish as it would have been far better if he did not marry and have a family so that he had no ties when he went gallivanting off over the galaxy. This idea is brought up. I guess they want to address the growing problem of families that are breaking apart. The family unit is no longer as solid as people believed that it was and the reason addressed in this movie is because we all pursue our own personal goals and not as a family.

    Incredibly bad storyline and continuity. A series of computer-generated story sequences strung together like a cheap necklace. It starts out well enough with a great opening sequence involving a crisis in space, then it quickly falls apart. Dr. Smith, always the villain, mutates into a giant bug! How can you fly through the sun? Time travel and the space-time continuum jumbled together at the finale in such a way that the whole thing makes even less sense than the puzzling ending to Disneys' "The Black Hole"! An annoying computer-generated pet monkey that hangs around sister "Penny's" neck and appears to have ADHD. Exhausting to watch. Sure not as much fun as the old silly Irwin Allen TV series. A total disappointment. One of the worst sci-fi movies of all time. So bad I was rootin' for the space spiders! I still love the robot, however. But he hasn't had any good lines since "Forbidden Planet".

    What have the following got in common? Disney's Black Hole, Alien, Aliens, Gremlins, The Thing (John Carpenter version), all Star Trek movies and TV episodes featuring technobabble and time travelling, the special effects in Dr Who, leading edge FX? The answer is that they have all been plagiarised or used in this film along with many other films and artefacts too numerous to mention. If you insist on going to see this film then you'd better resign yourself to the fact that every other scene will remind you of something else and that scenes of technical FX mastery will be followed by, or mixed with, scenes of such naffness that they would make the crew of Blake's 7 blush in embarrassment. I think there may have been a good film in there somewhere but it is too late for it ever to be reconstituted. The Robinson family, for it is they, get lost not only in space but also in time, not to mention lost in plot. Let's face it, apart from a very obvious thing that happens with Will Robinson, the plot is utterly incomprehensible. The Robinsons seem to be flung into the far reaches of time, space and plot by baddies with inscrutable plans, onto spaceships which may or may not have anything to do with the plot but look cool and have spiffy monsters, in periods of time which may be before after or sideways from the main timeline. Do not try to make sense of this if you value your mental health. Some good bits are; the casting is pretty effective, especially Gary Oldman, some of the FX are quite stunning, music and soundtrack are fine, things explode and go "whoosh" a lot, the robot is well cool and delivers some of the best acting in the film with the immortal "Danger Will Robinson, Danger!" So long as you let yourself go this is rather similar to the experience of taking hallucinatory drugs (allegedly) and of similar value.

    It's obvious the directors had no comprehension of the Space/Time continuum because this film defies it in so many ways. I say this mainly as the third act opens as Space Family Robinson are hurled decades into the future (at least 20 years I imagine but they don't specify this), where on a distant world they bump into their future selves. The main problem with this idea is that in order for them to bump into their older selves their older selves would have had to have been living on the planet for the past 20 years or so, whereas in the film they had just arrived, meaning they couldn't possibly live there. Also, Dr Smith kills his past self and yet his future self doesn't disappear, and young Will Robinson is killed in an explosion yet the future William doesn't disappear either. Apart from that the acting is as bland as cardboard as many of the characters have no defining character. Dr Smith is you're usual over the top bad guy (although my favourite part used to be when he had become his spider self, a character indulged in mystery but that's heading off track), John Robinson's character is unrealistically emotionless, Matt le Blanc is your average rough Space Cowboy type, the elder daughter is your typical hard-to-get type, the younger daughter is often considered to be the Missing Chipette and Will doesn't get enough credit for his amazing work, instead he gets bawled off by his siblings and his talent is only really exploited by the bad guy Dr. Smith, which leads to later character development but it would have needed to have been a longer more developed film, where rather than stumbling across their future selves, the film could have been a documentary of how the Robinson's struggled to survive on the harsh and unforgiving world and eventually another set of characters come across them leading to the events of the end of the film, etc, etc. Overall, a weak attempt at sci-fi with some OK CGI but not much else going for it...

    In the year 2058 Earth is suffering of pollution and will soon be uninhabitable after the irreversible effects of global warming. Space colony family struggles to survive when a spy/accidental stowaway throws their ship hopelessly off course. Professor John Robinson (William Hurt), his wife Maureen (Mimi Rogers) , their children Judy (Heather Graham) , Penny (Lacey Chabert) and Will (Jack Johnson) and Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc , Sean Patrick Flanery was originally cast and was also previously offered to Matthew Perry) are selected to go to the third planet in the Alpha Centauri star system to establish a colony so that other Earth people can settle there. They are to go there on a ship christened the Jupiter 2. However, Doctor Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman) , an agent for an enemy (Edward Fox) , is sent to sabotage the mission. He is successful in reprogramming the ship's robot, but in the process becomes trapped on the ship , the ship and all on board become hopelessly lost and it now becomes a fight for survival as the crew tries to find their way back home . Now they are fighting to live long enough to find a way home . Familiar Sci-Fi dealing with Robinson family was going into space to fight for a chance for humanity , it is plenty of special effects , thrills , action though regularly developed . The picture has some good moments here and there , but is also full of flaws and gaps . Screenplay by Akiva Goldsman who wrote a script with absurd situations and embarrassing scenes. Silly and ridiculous images , especially starred by the computer monkey made by means of botching effects and the giant spider-Doctor Smith too . Mediocre performances and all principals actors were contracted to a three picture option, but as the film failed to recoup its budget in North America, plans for a new franchise were scrapped . Good photography by cinematographer Peter Levy who frequently works with the filmmaker . Thrilling and atmospheric musical score by Bruce Broughton . The motion picture was middling directed by Stephen Hopkins who has realized some acceptable Sci-Fi and Terror films as &uml;Nightmare in ElmStreet 5 &uml; , &uml;Predator 2&uml;, &uml;The reaping &uml; , though his better films were &uml;The ghost and the darkness&uml; and &uml;The life and death of Peter Sellers&uml;. &uml;Lost in space&uml; turns out to be his worst movie . Rating : Below average . The classic and best version results to be 84 episodes for television produced by Irwin Allen , starred by Guy Williams (John Robinson) , June Lockhart ( Maureen Robinson) , Mark Goddard (Maj. Don West), Marta Kristen (Judy Robinson) , Bill Mumy ( Will Robinson) and Angela Cartwright . (Penny Robinson).Originally, all surviving cast members of the TV show were meant to have cameo appearances. Mark Goddard, the original Major Don West, plays the General. June Lockhart,plays Will Robinson's principal , Marta Kristen and Angela Cartwright play reporters and Dick Tufeld reprises his role from Lost in Space as the voice of the Robot. Ironically, Bill Mumy and Jonathan Harris, the two actors most supportive of the idea of a new movie , did not appear in it.

    I cannot believe all the wannabe movie critics ripping this movie apart. All of the negative reviews appear to be from people comparing it to the TV series. If there never was a TV series, they'd be lauding it's wonderful effects and story line, but they are so busy comparing it line-by-line to the original series, they can't get past it. Are you serious? You really wanted this movie to be anything like that crummy TV series? Get over it. The series laid a good plot line, but beyond that it was cheaply made and the scripts were so G-rated there was almost no story at all. And the character development in the series was plastic and phony, to the point of being non-existent, even for the 60's. I was a 9 year old boy when this series was first aired on TV, and when I watched it, the most fun I had was ripping it apart because of how fake it was. Even as a 9-year-old I could see that. Guys love to do this, and this is the show that taught me how to do it. Even so, I enjoyed it for what it was - SciFi on prime time. Now this updated movie actually does some character building and provides an interesting plot, and the history buffs can't stand it. There is a reason why LIS was canceled, and why so many SciFi prime time shows don't last long. People want to see the grit, the fire, the real people behind the characters, not some Hollywood plastic version. Because I didn't fall into the trap of comparing it with the original series, I loved this movie. It is SciFi at it's best. Good story, good character building, good back story on the plot and characters, great effects, twists, turns, action. This may be the most underrated SciFi movie of all time. Watch it without comparisons to the TV series, and you are guaranteed to enjoy.

    Those who have followed and been long time fans of Lost In Space (1965) TV series will be just as disappointed, as I was. What most everyone was looking for in seeing certainly wasn't a remake but a conclusion. Where the Robinson family & stowaway Dr. Smith would finally make it to the new Earth, Alpha Centauri...not Alpha Prime, for colonization. What was totally out of character was when John and Don got into a verbal fight and were disrespectful over who would lead the mission, including the obscene P word that Maureen used to set them straight. Also how Will and Penny were like from a dysfunctional family, where they didn't get along and were preoccupied with their own self-worths and what mattered to only them. Even, Don hitting on Judy as if she was something to conquer for the fulfillment of his ego wasn't right. Instead of giving the viewer something they didn't know about each character, the creators played off of what one already knows, combined with some kind of disrespect & immorality (which is the opposite of what the original characters were all about). While the latter is what most of real society appears to be like today, there are still good, decent people in the world. So why patronize bad for good? I thought it was a joke when they used a bald man during the launch for Alpha Control. During the launch, when we saw how the likeness of the original Jupiter 2 , as Jupiter 1, was blown off, like some temporary booster fuselage, with a new Jupiter 2 design emerging (butterfly effect of coming out of a cocoon), it was as though the creators were saying "Out with the old and in with the new." Even the short cameo appearance of the original cast bothered me to no end, as I felt they were taken badly advantage of, as filmsy attempt to gain long time LIS fans favor. When we were all looking forward to seeing our favorites as they are today. With the unfortunate loss of Guy Williams, the creators still could of used the original cast members. All they would of had to to is put Williams in much like how The Crow, City of Angels (1996) was done to fill in for Brandon Lee. Or they could of resorted to like Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001) used total computer generated characters. Lastly, they could of done a nation wide search for someone who looks exactly like Guy Williams to be Professor John Robinson. Those who were not accepted or were convincing as the characters they portrayed is William Hurt as Prof. Robinson, Jack Johnson as Will and Jared Harris as the older Will. Gary Oldman as Dr. Smith was OK but they could of done better. The boy who in a Campbell's Soup commercial that came in out of the cold and melted his snowman appearance away, I felt would of been a better choice for Will Robinson than someone who looked too much like the Space Monkey. Another thumbs down is the older Will didn't even so much resemble the younger Will. Another bad thing thing that can't be ignored is when did John Robinson have blondish looking hair? The only things I could say was good about the movie was the futuristic designs, special effects and why it was vitally important that the Robinson family make it to pioneer in the colonization of a new planet with earth-like conditions.

Professor Robinson wanted to head the mission but said that the only way he would do it is if his family came along. This is really selfish as it would have been far better if he did not marry and have a family so that he had no ties when he went gallivanting off over the galaxy. This idea is brought up. I guess they want to address the growing problem of families that are breaking apart. The family unit is no longer as solid as people believed that it was and the reason addressed in this movie is because we all pursue our own personal goals and not as a family.

    Incredibly bad storyline and continuity. A series of computer-generated story sequences strung together like a cheap necklace. It starts out well enough with a great opening sequence involving a crisis in space, then it quickly falls apart. Dr. Smith, always the villain, mutates into a giant bug! How can you fly through the sun? Time travel and the space-time continuum jumbled together at the finale in such a way that the whole thing makes even less sense than the puzzling ending to Disneys' "The Black Hole"! An annoying computer-generated pet monkey that hangs around sister "Penny's" neck and appears to have ADHD. Exhausting to watch. Sure not as much fun as the old silly Irwin Allen TV series. A total disappointment. One of the worst sci-fi movies of all time. So bad I was rootin' for the space spiders! I still love the robot, however. But he hasn't had any good lines since "Forbidden Planet".

    What have the following got in common? Disney's Black Hole, Alien, Aliens, Gremlins, The Thing (John Carpenter version), all Star Trek movies and TV episodes featuring technobabble and time travelling, the special effects in Dr Who, leading edge FX? The answer is that they have all been plagiarised or used in this film along with many other films and artefacts too numerous to mention. If you insist on going to see this film then you'd better resign yourself to the fact that every other scene will remind you of something else and that scenes of technical FX mastery will be followed by, or mixed with, scenes of such naffness that they would make the crew of Blake's 7 blush in embarrassment. I think there may have been a good film in there somewhere but it is too late for it ever to be reconstituted. The Robinson family, for it is they, get lost not only in space but also in time, not to mention lost in plot. Let's face it, apart from a very obvious thing that happens with Will Robinson, the plot is utterly incomprehensible. The Robinsons seem to be flung into the far reaches of time, space and plot by baddies with inscrutable plans, onto spaceships which may or may not have anything to do with the plot but look cool and have spiffy monsters, in periods of time which may be before after or sideways from the main timeline. Do not try to make sense of this if you value your mental health. Some good bits are; the casting is pretty effective, especially Gary Oldman, some of the FX are quite stunning, music and soundtrack are fine, things explode and go "whoosh" a lot, the robot is well cool and delivers some of the best acting in the film with the immortal "Danger Will Robinson, Danger!" So long as you let yourself go this is rather similar to the experience of taking hallucinatory drugs (allegedly) and of similar value.

    It's obvious the directors had no comprehension of the Space/Time continuum because this film defies it in so many ways. I say this mainly as the third act opens as Space Family Robinson are hurled decades into the future (at least 20 years I imagine but they don't specify this), where on a distant world they bump into their future selves. The main problem with this idea is that in order for them to bump into their older selves their older selves would have had to have been living on the planet for the past 20 years or so, whereas in the film they had just arrived, meaning they couldn't possibly live there. Also, Dr Smith kills his past self and yet his future self doesn't disappear, and young Will Robinson is killed in an explosion yet the future William doesn't disappear either. Apart from that the acting is as bland as cardboard as many of the characters have no defining character. Dr Smith is you're usual over the top bad guy (although my favourite part used to be when he had become his spider self, a character indulged in mystery but that's heading off track), John Robinson's character is unrealistically emotionless, Matt le Blanc is your average rough Space Cowboy type, the elder daughter is your typical hard-to-get type, the younger daughter is often considered to be the Missing Chipette and Will doesn't get enough credit for his amazing work, instead he gets bawled off by his siblings and his talent is only really exploited by the bad guy Dr. Smith, which leads to later character development but it would have needed to have been a longer more developed film, where rather than stumbling across their future selves, the film could have been a documentary of how the Robinson's struggled to survive on the harsh and unforgiving world and eventually another set of characters come across them leading to the events of the end of the film, etc, etc. Overall, a weak attempt at sci-fi with some OK CGI but not much else going for it...

    In the year 2058 Earth is suffering of pollution and will soon be uninhabitable after the irreversible effects of global warming. Space colony family struggles to survive when a spy/accidental stowaway throws their ship hopelessly off course. Professor John Robinson (William Hurt), his wife Maureen (Mimi Rogers) , their children Judy (Heather Graham) , Penny (Lacey Chabert) and Will (Jack Johnson) and Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc , Sean Patrick Flanery was originally cast and was also previously offered to Matthew Perry) are selected to go to the third planet in the Alpha Centauri star system to establish a colony so that other Earth people can settle there. They are to go there on a ship christened the Jupiter 2. However, Doctor Zachary Smith (Gary Oldman) , an agent for an enemy (Edward Fox) , is sent to sabotage the mission. He is successful in reprogramming the ship's robot, but in the process becomes trapped on the ship , the ship and all on board become hopelessly lost and it now becomes a fight for survival as the crew tries to find their way back home . Now they are fighting to live long enough to find a way home . Familiar Sci-Fi dealing with Robinson family was going into space to fight for a chance for humanity , it is plenty of special effects , thrills , action though regularly developed . The picture has some good moments here and there , but is also full of flaws and gaps . Screenplay by Akiva Goldsman who wrote a script with absurd situations and embarrassing scenes. Silly and ridiculous images , especially starred by the computer monkey made by means of botching effects and the giant spider-Doctor Smith too . Mediocre performances and all principals actors were contracted to a three picture option, but as the film failed to recoup its budget in North America, plans for a new franchise were scrapped . Good photography by cinematographer Peter Levy who frequently works with the filmmaker . Thrilling and atmospheric musical score by Bruce Broughton . The motion picture was middling directed by Stephen Hopkins who has realized some acceptable Sci-Fi and Terror films as &uml;Nightmare in ElmStreet 5 &uml; , &uml;Predator 2&uml;, &uml;The reaping &uml; , though his better films were &uml;The ghost and the darkness&uml; and &uml;The life and death of Peter Sellers&uml;. &uml;Lost in space&uml; turns out to be his worst movie . Rating : Below average . The classic and best version results to be 84 episodes for television produced by Irwin Allen , starred by Guy Williams (John Robinson) , June Lockhart ( Maureen Robinson) , Mark Goddard (Maj. Don West), Marta Kristen (Judy Robinson) , Bill Mumy ( Will Robinson) and Angela Cartwright . (Penny Robinson).Originally, all surviving cast members of the TV show were meant to have cameo appearances. Mark Goddard, the original Major Don West, plays the General. June Lockhart,plays Will Robinson's principal , Marta Kristen and Angela Cartwright play reporters and Dick Tufeld reprises his role from Lost in Space as the voice of the Robot. Ironically, Bill Mumy and Jonathan Harris, the two actors most supportive of the idea of a new movie , did not appear in it.

    I cannot believe all the wannabe movie critics ripping this movie apart. All of the negative reviews appear to be from people comparing it to the TV series. If there never was a TV series, they'd be lauding it's wonderful effects and story line, but they are so busy comparing it line-by-line to the original series, they can't get past it. Are you serious? You really wanted this movie to be anything like that crummy TV series? Get over it. The series laid a good plot line, but beyond that it was cheaply made and the scripts were so G-rated there was almost no story at all. And the character development in the series was plastic and phony, to the point of being non-existent, even for the 60's. I was a 9 year old boy when this series was first aired on TV, and when I watched it, the most fun I had was ripping it apart because of how fake it was. Even as a 9-year-old I could see that. Guys love to do this, and this is the show that taught me how to do it. Even so, I enjoyed it for what it was - SciFi on prime time. Now this updated movie actually does some character building and provides an interesting plot, and the history buffs can't stand it. There is a reason why LIS was canceled, and why so many SciFi prime time shows don't last long. People want to see the grit, the fire, the real people behind the characters, not some Hollywood plastic version. Because I didn't fall into the trap of comparing it with the original series, I loved this movie. It is SciFi at it's best. Good story, good character building, good back story on the plot and characters, great effects, twists, turns, action. This may be the most underrated SciFi movie of all time. Watch it without comparisons to the TV series, and you are guaranteed to enjoy.

    Those who have followed and been long time fans of Lost In Space (1965) TV series will be just as disappointed, as I was. What most everyone was looking for in seeing certainly wasn't a remake but a conclusion. Where the Robinson family & stowaway Dr. Smith would finally make it to the new Earth, Alpha Centauri...not Alpha Prime, for colonization. What was totally out of character was when John and Don got into a verbal fight and were disrespectful over who would lead the mission, including the obscene P word that Maureen used to set them straight. Also how Will and Penny were like from a dysfunctional family, where they didn't get along and were preoccupied with their own self-worths and what mattered to only them. Even, Don hitting on Judy as if she was something to conquer for the fulfillment of his ego wasn't right. Instead of giving the viewer something they didn't know about each character, the creators played off of what one already knows, combined with some kind of disrespect & immorality (which is the opposite of what the original characters were all about). While the latter is what most of real society appears to be like today, there are still good, decent people in the world. So why patronize bad for good? I thought it was a joke when they used a bald man during the launch for Alpha Control. During the launch, when we saw how the likeness of the original Jupiter 2 , as Jupiter 1, was blown off, like some temporary booster fuselage, with a new Jupiter 2 design emerging (butterfly effect of coming out of a cocoon), it was as though the creators were saying "Out with the old and in with the new." Even the short cameo appearance of the original cast bothered me to no end, as I felt they were taken badly advantage of, as filmsy attempt to gain long time LIS fans favor. When we were all looking forward to seeing our favorites as they are today. With the unfortunate loss of Guy Williams, the creators still could of used the original cast members. All they would of had to to is put Williams in much like how The Crow, City of Angels (1996) was done to fill in for Brandon Lee. Or they could of resorted to like Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001) used total computer generated characters. Lastly, they could of done a nation wide search for someone who looks exactly like Guy Williams to be Professor John Robinson. Those who were not accepted or were convincing as the characters they portrayed is William Hurt as Prof. Robinson, Jack Johnson as Will and Jared Harris as the older Will. Gary Oldman as Dr. Smith was OK but they could of done better. The boy who in a Campbell's Soup commercial that came in out of the cold and melted his snowman appearance away, I felt would of been a better choice for Will Robinson than someone who looked too much like the Space Monkey. Another thumbs down is the older Will didn't even so much resemble the younger Will. Another bad thing thing that can't be ignored is when did John Robinson have blondish looking hair? The only things I could say was good about the movie was the futuristic designs, special effects and why it was vitally important that the Robinson family make it to pioneer in the colonization of a new planet with earth-like conditions.

    I am relatively sure they were hoping to do a sequel or two for this film, however no sequels were ever forthcoming and this film is pretty much a forgotten film of the 90's whose main claim to fame is the fact it knocked off Titanic from the number one spot at the movies. That does not mean your film is good, I do believe all the guys got together and said to themselves "This looks tolerable" and they poured into theaters just to sink the ship. I am surprised the score is so low here, granted the score I am giving it is not much higher, but I have to say some of the visuals were quite good and there were some interesting things going on in this movie. Just way to much in the plot, it went here and there and crammed a whole lot of stuff in the film making it a bit to long and to jumbled. The film is about a family that gets lost in space thanks to the dastardly Dr. Smith played by Gary Oldman who is the only really interesting character in the film. Everyone else is bland with the exception of Matt LeBlanc who is just horribly miscast in an action type role which he neither has the acting ability or looks to do. The best thing about this film is the effects as the are very good, especially considering when this film was made. It just needed a whole lot of work on the plot, a bit of simplifying rather than the "let's throw it all in" approach they seemed to take with this one. Still, it did knock out Titanic, before it quickly sank into obscurity.

    First, let me point out two saving graces for this movie. Gary Oldman's performance was very entertaining and the visuals are very cool looking which is the reason why I'm giving this a two out of ten. So, what's wrong with this movie? EVERYTHING! The story was too clich&eacute;d and predictable, the acting was so horrible, the writing is messed up, the dialogue was god-awful the action is way over the top and it also has poorly CGI quality effects. I think the music was OK, but nothing special. To be honest, I never watch the TV show this movie was based on, but given the horrible reception in this film, I would definitely watch it to keep me interested. Anyway, horrible movie. Avoid it.

    Let me just establish one thing: I am border-line obsessed with Gary Oldman. I think that he is hands down the greatest actor / human being (other than my mum) that the world has ever known. So, naturally, I have made a habit of buying every film of his if I happen to stumble upon it. that is how I came across "Lost in Space". I could tell right away just by looking at the cover that this was going to be yet another one of those cheesy, gaudy 90's sci-fi flicks, but it was $3.99 and it had Gary Oldman in it. Why not? Here is why not: This. Film. Is trash. False. A trash can would not even allow this crap to infect it with its filth. Now, I have never seen the TV series, but if the story line of this film is anything like it, than it's a mystery how it ever stayed on the air. It's just soggy with campy clich&eacute;s. The characters are not even half-baked, and are always making juvenile and completely incompetent one-liners that don't even fit in with the rest of the conversation. Okay. This needs its own paragraph just due to the sheer annoyance of it. That stupid stupid stupid space monkey. What is up with that lame freaking monkey? It's not cute. It's eyes are just . . . It's a pointless monkey. I hate the monkey. That is all. Now for the acting. Don't get me wrong. I love Matt Leblanc in "Friends". But I'm not sure anymore as to whether or not he can actually act. The whole time he's trying to be this Bruce Willis-esque macho man, but he just seems ridiculous in trying. William Hurt is kind of, for lack of a better word, meh. Same goes for Mimi Rogers and Heather Graham.Lacy Chabert - as far as acting talent goes in this film, there is none for Gretchen Wieners, bye. Jack Johnson was fine. Now, Gary Oldman - the reason that I forced myself to sit down in front of this crap for the full 2 hours of torture. Gary, you are a fantastic actor. The best of the best. There is nothing that you have done that is disappointing. But dear Lord in Heaven. Why oh why would you agree to playing a man named Dr. "Spider" Smith? The name alone should give you a red light signal. This is the lamest waste of a villain that the world has ever known. He's uncharismatic, unintelligent, has no chutzpah whatsoever, and doesn't appear to have any motives for his mindless actions. When his future self transforms into a spider, it's not creepy, it's not sad. It's just embarrassing. So so so very cheesy. GARY! PLEASE TELL ME YOU DID NOT READ THE SCRIPT BEFORE AGREEING TO PLAY THIS ONE. To his eternal credit, Mr. Oldman did his best to add some charm and humor to Zachary Smith. For instance, when he says "Yes. Yeees . . . I'm a doctor." I actually laughed a little. Not because the line is funny - none of the script is remotely amusing - but just the bizarrely creepy way he said it. (It's even funnier in the blooper reel when he pauses a bit afterwards before saying ". . . And a pervert". I think they should have kept that in.) Anyway, enough of this banter. Gary, I'm not mad at you, just please don't do this again. So, to sum up, PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS GARBAGE!!! even if you're a fan of Gary oldman - actually, ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of Gary Oldman, just stay away. Yes, he managed to make it slightly watchable, but just barely. If you have any self-respect, do not do what i did and waste a good $3.99 on this mistake of a "film" A very generous 1/10.

    There seems to be a bit of a fad in remaking old television shows, but then Hollywood will do anything to make a little bit of money. Lost in Space is based on the very old TV series and has been spruced up by the typical Hollywood glitz. I never really got into the original series and the movie didn't really reach my expectations. The situation is that the Earth is dying and Professor Robinson is going on a mission to travel to another planet and build a hypergate so that colonists may move to this new world. Unfortunately there is an organisation that wishes to halt this progress and instead colonise this world for themselves. They pay Doctor Smith (Gary Oldman) to sabotage the mission, and decide to kill him while he is on the ship. When the ship, the Jupiter 2, takes off, Doctor Smith is on board as well as a killer robot. There is no single plot in this movie as once one problem is solved another one arises. The ultimate goal is to either return home or to complete their mission but this is not addressed in the movie. It is left open so as to possibly bring out a sequel. The plot elements are developed from the beginning though so the movie is a bit predictable. There is a large emphasis placed on Will Robinson's time travel experiments and they also talk about how hyperspace engines will send you to a random place in the galaxy and thus are very unreliable. When they mentioned that I knew how they were going to become lost. This movie places emphasis more on family values and seems to be directed towards those of use who are or are planning on becoming fathers. Basically the moral is that our family is the most important part of our lives and we should put a lot of time into it. Professor Robinson wanted to head the mission but said that the only way he would do it is if his family came along. This is really selfish as it would have been far better if he did not marry and have a family so that he had no ties when he went gallivanting off over the galaxy. This idea is brought up. I guess they want to address the growing problem of families that are breaking apart.

The motion picture was middling directed by Stephen Hopkins who has realized some acceptable Sci-Fi and Terror films as &uml;Nightmare in ElmStreet 5 &uml; , &uml;Predator 2&uml;, &uml;The reaping &uml; , though his better films were &uml;The ghost and the darkness&uml; and &uml;The life and death of Peter Sellers&uml;. &uml;Lost in space&uml; turns out to be his worst movie . Rating : Below average . The classic and best version results to be 84 episodes for television produced by Irwin Allen , starred by Guy Williams (John Robinson) , June Lockhart ( Maureen Robinson) , Mark Goddard (Maj. Don West), Marta Kristen (Judy Robinson) , Bill Mumy ( Will Robinson) and Angela Cartwright . (Penny Robinson).Originally, all surviving cast members of the TV show were meant to have cameo appearances. Mark Goddard, the original Major Don West, plays the General. June Lockhart,plays Will Robinson's principal , Marta Kristen and Angela Cartwright play reporters and Dick Tufeld reprises his role from Lost in Space as the voice of the Robot. Ironically, Bill Mumy and Jonathan Harris, the two actors most supportive of the idea of a new movie , did not appear in it.

    I cannot believe all the wannabe movie critics ripping this movie apart. All of the negative reviews appear to be from people comparing it to the TV series. If there never was a TV series, they'd be lauding it's wonderful effects and story line, but they are so busy comparing it line-by-line to the original series, they can't get past it. Are you serious? You really wanted this movie to be anything like that crummy TV series? Get over it. The series laid a good plot line, but beyond that it was cheaply made and the scripts were so G-rated there was almost no story at all. And the character development in the series was plastic and phony, to the point of being non-existent, even for the 60's. I was a 9 year old boy when this series was first aired on TV, and when I watched it, the most fun I had was ripping it apart because of how fake it was. Even as a 9-year-old I could see that. Guys love to do this, and this is the show that taught me how to do it. Even so, I enjoyed it for what it was - SciFi on prime time. Now this updated movie actually does some character building and provides an interesting plot, and the history buffs can't stand it. There is a reason why LIS was canceled, and why so many SciFi prime time shows don't last long. People want to see the grit, the fire, the real people behind the characters, not some Hollywood plastic version. Because I didn't fall into the trap of comparing it with the original series, I loved this movie. It is SciFi at it's best. Good story, good character building, good back story on the plot and characters, great effects, twists, turns, action. This may be the most underrated SciFi movie of all time. Watch it without comparisons to the TV series, and you are guaranteed to enjoy.

    Those who have followed and been long time fans of Lost In Space (1965) TV series will be just as disappointed, as I was. What most everyone was looking for in seeing certainly wasn't a remake but a conclusion. Where the Robinson family & stowaway Dr. Smith would finally make it to the new Earth, Alpha Centauri...not Alpha Prime, for colonization. What was totally out of character was when John and Don got into a verbal fight and were disrespectful over who would lead the mission, including the obscene P word that Maureen used to set them straight. Also how Will and Penny were like from a dysfunctional family, where they didn't get along and were preoccupied with their own self-worths and what mattered to only them. Even, Don hitting on Judy as if she was something to conquer for the fulfillment of his ego wasn't right. Instead of giving the viewer something they didn't know about each character, the creators played off of what one already knows, combined with some kind of disrespect & immorality (which is the opposite of what the original characters were all about). While the latter is what most of real society appears to be like today, there are still good, decent people in the world. So why patronize bad for good? I thought it was a joke when they used a bald man during the launch for Alpha Control. During the launch, when we saw how the likeness of the original Jupiter 2 , as Jupiter 1, was blown off, like some temporary booster fuselage, with a new Jupiter 2 design emerging (butterfly effect of coming out of a cocoon), it was as though the creators were saying "Out with the old and in with the new." Even the short cameo appearance of the original cast bothered me to no end, as I felt they were taken badly advantage of, as filmsy attempt to gain long time LIS fans favor. When we were all looking forward to seeing our favorites as they are today. With the unfortunate loss of Guy Williams, the creators still could of used the original cast members. All they would of had to to is put Williams in much like how The Crow, City of Angels (1996) was done to fill in for Brandon Lee. Or they could of resorted to like Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001) used total computer generated characters. Lastly, they could of done a nation wide search for someone who looks exactly like Guy Williams to be Professor John Robinson. Those who were not accepted or were convincing as the characters they portrayed is William Hurt as Prof. Robinson, Jack Johnson as Will and Jared Harris as the older Will. Gary Oldman as Dr. Smith was OK but they could of done better. The boy who in a Campbell's Soup commercial that came in out of the cold and melted his snowman appearance away, I felt would of been a better choice for Will Robinson than someone who looked too much like the Space Monkey. Another thumbs down is the older Will didn't even so much resemble the younger Will. Another bad thing thing that can't be ignored is when did John Robinson have blondish looking hair? The only things I could say was good about the movie was the futuristic designs, special effects and why it was vitally important that the Robinson family make it to pioneer in the colonization of a new planet with earth-like conditions.

    I am relatively sure they were hoping to do a sequel or two for this film, however no sequels were ever forthcoming and this film is pretty much a forgotten film of the 90's whose main claim to fame is the fact it knocked off Titanic from the number one spot at the movies. That does not mean your film is good, I do believe all the guys got together and said to themselves "This looks tolerable" and they poured into theaters just to sink the ship. I am surprised the score is so low here, granted the score I am giving it is not much higher, but I have to say some of the visuals were quite good and there were some interesting things going on in this movie. Just way to much in the plot, it went here and there and crammed a whole lot of stuff in the film making it a bit to long and to jumbled. The film is about a family that gets lost in space thanks to the dastardly Dr. Smith played by Gary Oldman who is the only really interesting character in the film. Everyone else is bland with the exception of Matt LeBlanc who is just horribly miscast in an action type role which he neither has the acting ability or looks to do. The best thing about this film is the effects as the are very good, especially considering when this film was made. It just needed a whole lot of work on the plot, a bit of simplifying rather than the "let's throw it all in" approach they seemed to take with this one. Still, it did knock out Titanic, before it quickly sank into obscurity.

    First, let me point out two saving graces for this movie. Gary Oldman's performance was very entertaining and the visuals are very cool looking which is the reason why I'm giving this a two out of ten. So, what's wrong with this movie? EVERYTHING! The story was too clich&eacute;d and predictable, the acting was so horrible, the writing is messed up, the dialogue was god-awful the action is way over the top and it also has poorly CGI quality effects. I think the music was OK, but nothing special. To be honest, I never watch the TV show this movie was based on, but given the horrible reception in this film, I would definitely watch it to keep me interested. Anyway, horrible movie. Avoid it.

    Let me just establish one thing: I am border-line obsessed with Gary Oldman. I think that he is hands down the greatest actor / human being (other than my mum) that the world has ever known. So, naturally, I have made a habit of buying every film of his if I happen to stumble upon it. that is how I came across "Lost in Space". I could tell right away just by looking at the cover that this was going to be yet another one of those cheesy, gaudy 90's sci-fi flicks, but it was $3.99 and it had Gary Oldman in it. Why not? Here is why not: This. Film. Is trash. False. A trash can would not even allow this crap to infect it with its filth. Now, I have never seen the TV series, but if the story line of this film is anything like it, than it's a mystery how it ever stayed on the air. It's just soggy with campy clich&eacute;s. The characters are not even half-baked, and are always making juvenile and completely incompetent one-liners that don't even fit in with the rest of the conversation. Okay. This needs its own paragraph just due to the sheer annoyance of it. That stupid stupid stupid space monkey. What is up with that lame freaking monkey? It's not cute. It's eyes are just . . . It's a pointless monkey. I hate the monkey. That is all. Now for the acting. Don't get me wrong. I love Matt Leblanc in "Friends". But I'm not sure anymore as to whether or not he can actually act. The whole time he's trying to be this Bruce Willis-esque macho man, but he just seems ridiculous in trying. William Hurt is kind of, for lack of a better word, meh. Same goes for Mimi Rogers and Heather Graham.Lacy Chabert - as far as acting talent goes in this film, there is none for Gretchen Wieners, bye. Jack Johnson was fine. Now, Gary Oldman - the reason that I forced myself to sit down in front of this crap for the full 2 hours of torture. Gary, you are a fantastic actor. The best of the best. There is nothing that you have done that is disappointing. But dear Lord in Heaven. Why oh why would you agree to playing a man named Dr. "Spider" Smith? The name alone should give you a red light signal. This is the lamest waste of a villain that the world has ever known. He's uncharismatic, unintelligent, has no chutzpah whatsoever, and doesn't appear to have any motives for his mindless actions. When his future self transforms into a spider, it's not creepy, it's not sad. It's just embarrassing. So so so very cheesy. GARY! PLEASE TELL ME YOU DID NOT READ THE SCRIPT BEFORE AGREEING TO PLAY THIS ONE. To his eternal credit, Mr. Oldman did his best to add some charm and humor to Zachary Smith. For instance, when he says "Yes. Yeees . . . I'm a doctor." I actually laughed a little. Not because the line is funny - none of the script is remotely amusing - but just the bizarrely creepy way he said it. (It's even funnier in the blooper reel when he pauses a bit afterwards before saying ". . . And a pervert". I think they should have kept that in.) Anyway, enough of this banter. Gary, I'm not mad at you, just please don't do this again. So, to sum up, PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS GARBAGE!!! even if you're a fan of Gary oldman - actually, ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of Gary Oldman, just stay away. Yes, he managed to make it slightly watchable, but just barely. If you have any self-respect, do not do what i did and waste a good $3.99 on this mistake of a "film" A very generous 1/10.
