    Balto is a spectacular film that is an underrated classic. I first saw Balto when I was young and loved it. The film opens with a grandmother walking with her granddaughter and their dog through Central Park, New York. The grandmother wants to show her granddaughter a memorial. They sit down and she begins to tell the story of Balto. The film then flashes back to 1925 in Nome, Alaska. Their we meet Balto, a wolf dog and his caretaker a Russian snow goose named Boris. They are in a rush to see the finish of a sled race. Their Balto sees Jenna, a husky and her owner a little girl named Rosy. The race is one by Steele, a proud and fierce Siberian husky. Steele, the other dogs and the people of Nome see Balto as an outcast due to his half breed status. Balto sneaks back into the city to see Jenna. They discover that the hospital is filled to a strange size and they listen to a meeting between the head doctor and Rosy's father. Diphtheria has spread to Nome and the hospital has run out of antitoxin. A message is sent through to Anchorage and a train is packed to bear the storm and stop at an outpost where a sled dog team will retrieve the medicine. Steele and his team leave but are lost on their way back. Balto and his friends set out to find the lost team. Jenna gets injured and his friends bring her back to Nome while Balto goes alone. Balto is now on a life journey to bring back the toxin before the Diphtheria becomes fatile. The voices in Balto are well selected. We have Kevin Bacon voicing Balto, Bridget Fonda as Jenna, Bob Hoskins as Boris and Jim Cummings as Steele. Miriam Margoyles is also worthy of recognition for playing the grandmother in the beginning and end of the film. The reason why Balto is so good is how serious it can take itself. Their is good occasional comedy but the film does have a dark story line and accompanies it with some dark images. The main character is great. If I were to pick an animated character who resembles me, one of them would be Balto. The side characters are also good characters. Jim Cummings voices Steele who has pride and he will do whatever he can to defend it. He is more of a jerk then a villain and I appreciate the movie for this. The film is also well directed by the underrated Simon Wells who went on to make another classic, The Prince of Egypt. The scenery is brilliant for the film and it still takes my breath away. The ending is just amazing. If people decide to watch Balto, they need to listen to the song at the end "Reach for the Light" sung by Steve Winewood. It gives me goosebumps every time that I hear it. One other comment I should make about Balto is that the film does take itself quite seriously. I don't want to give away some of these themes but you will be surprised by this film especially if you look at the other animated movies that came out before it. Don't get me wrong there are some light hearted comedic moments but the film does keep its intensity and atmosphere. The film's strength lies in its atmosphere and the character of Balto. So many animated movies at this time try to focus on side characters but fail to develop the main character. This film does this very well. I will continue to watch this film via DVD that I recently purchased. The story that you see is true. Of course, some things have been changed but the bravery of the sled dogs led by Balto saved countless lives and the film honours them well. This is among my favourite movies of all time and that will not change. If you like 2D animated films, Balto is one of the best.

    It's rare that one finds an animated movie that has so much heart that isn't connected to Disney. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any others that stand out than this movie. Balto (1995), was loosely based off the real life events of an actual husky dog of the same name. The only difference is that the story was changed slightly to give the character of Balto a little more background. That is why it's loosely based off the actual events. Kudos to the four writers because it made this movie very enjoyable. Here, Balto lives on the edge of a town because he's not a husky. Yet somehow, everyone in the town, including the humans know his name? How is this possible (this is really the only thing I didn't understand)? His ancestry comes from dog/wolf, which leaves him in a bad spot because no one wants to trust him and the snooty pure bread husky dogs don't want a mutt joining their dog team. What Balto dreams most of, is running with the husky dogs and pulling the sleds they pull. And little does he know, but his chance will come sooner than he thinks, when a virus breakout comes on the town and he decides to fetch the medicine for the sick. The cast in this film is horrendously good too. Kevin Bacon voices our hero, Balto. Bacon is able to make his role really sound courageous and emotional when it needs to be and that's good. Voicing his love interest is Bridget Fonda as a little girl's husky named Jenna. Even if this is Fonda's first time doing voice acting, she did a great job. She knows how to give Jenna the right tone of voice and emotion at the same time. And I got to admit, Jenna and Balto make an adorable dog couple. Thank you animation department! Let's also not forget our antagonist named Steele voiced by famous voice actor, Jim Cummings. Cummings, who can do this work in his sleep, also gives a convincing performance as the thickheaded, husky with way too much hubris. And along with Steele are always the knuckle head followers of the antagonist. All of which have their own quirkiness about them, which make them funny. But that's not all. Accompanying Balto on his travels are three other friends. Two are a duo of polar bears named Muk and Luk, which are both voiced by musician Phil Collins. Surprisingly, even Collins gives a memorable performance. But the character I found the most entertaining when it came to comic relief was Boris the goose (the other friend) played by Bob Hoskins. Boris is such a great character because of how well he knows Balto and the problems that he faces. It is because of that, that he does his best to make sure his closest friend is in good hands. If you don't fall for Boris, I don't know what will. The art department did a nice job at keeping the view big and broad. Since the setting was in Alaska, it is only respective that the picture be epic looking. Mainly because, Alaska is epic period. Also I like the sounds a lot. Cracking ice to crunching snow. The one sound that I got chills from was hearing the wolves howl. I couldn't stop from getting goosebumps. I have no clue why but it gave me the shivers and that made me like it more. Adding to that was the soundtrack provided by composer James Horner and boy did it work. Excluding a few previous works that Horner has made that were mishaps, Horner really knows how to evoke the right emotions at the right time. It made watching Balto fun and invigorating. The characters alone is what makes the cake in this movie. The icing to the cake is James Horner's music, the grand backgrounds and involving sound effects.

    This movie's rating on IMDb is far too low. I didn't know this movie was so underrated. When it comes to animated movies, Disney is at the top of the food chain and Pixar comes in at a close second. So it's amazing that this non-Disney, animated film surpasses even some Disney movies -- I don't count the movies like High School Musical. Current Disney is trash aside from some good work like Tangled and Princess And The Frog. - -. -- This is the section where there are possible spoilers. Read at your own risk -- The story is told by Rosy, all grown up and with a granddaughter. From there the animation takes over. Balto, whose mother was a wolf and father a dog, was an outcast among not only dogs but also humans. Due to his half wolf heritage he was thought to be wild with the humans, and most of the dogs thought he was beneath them for being only half dog and a stray. Enter Jenna. Kind and caring to all, even to Steele even though he didn't deserve it. She gave him hope that acceptance wasn't as scarce and limited to two polar bears and a goose. However, his luck changes for the better-- giving him a chance to prove himself to not only the dogs but to the humans as well. The town is hit by an epidemic of diphtheria. And, due to the snow, the medicine is delayed on all modern forms of transportation. The town has little option left and decides to send in the best sledding team to retrieve it from the last layover. Balto was not picked, obviously, but after the team leaves he sets off to find them because a huge snow storm is approaching. -- End of possible spoilers -- I won't go any further, or I'd risk truly spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet but is looking it up on IMDb to see if it's worth watching. This movie will always have a special place in my heart. The story has all the elements it needs. Drama, conflict, romance, etc. The cast selected to VA was amazingly picked. Kevin Bacon did a wonderful job, as did Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins, Jim Cummings an Phil Collins. And the score was excellent. James Horner is a master composer, his work with Titanic is one of his most popular works, it's a shame that this one isn't for it is on equal ground... at least in my opinion. There you have it. Great animation, a interesting and eye catching plot, an amazing cast and musical score. Few films, real live action or animated/CGI, can pull off all of them. Balto did. So if you've never seen it, I recommend you do so and don't judge it until you've watched everything start to finish. I'll always have a fondness for it, I hope after seeing it you will too. My rating: 10 Stars out of 10 Stars.

    I recently found Balto and watched it as it was a film I never watched the whole way through when I was younger and when I found out about it recently and then bought the DVD I have fallen in love with it. The animation and storyline is good and I love the majority of the characters, bar Dixie, Muk and Luk. If those three weren't in it, it would be a lot greater film in my opinion but it is still a good watch. Due to being overshadowed by Toy Story this film never really took off and is not so well known but it really should be because it is a great kids film with great characters and animation and a storyline that, as well as being true, is exciting and makes this film very watchable. 8/10 :)

    I was only one year old when Balto got released in theaters, but I didn't even hear about its existence until recently. I love animation, I love dogs and I felt sorry to hear that this film wasn't very popular when it was released, so I decided to watch it on DVD. What I got was an amazing, inspiring and heart warming animated film which turned out to be one of the best I've ever seen. I was surprised about how much I was connected to the main character Balto. Because he is portrayed as a husky-wolf hybrid, the people of Nome fear of him for being part-wolf, the wolf packs reject him for being part-husky and the other dogs make fun of him for it. As a result, he is an outcast who doesn't know where he belongs, and only relying on Boris, a goose who is afraid of heights to take care of him. I showed a lot of sympathy towards Balto because I've been in similar situations and seeing him being left out was very emotive. The story is loosely based on the true 1925 serum run in Alaska. A disease spreads onto the children of Nome and a snow storm cuts all transport from delivering medicine, so a team sled dogs are sent to pick it up. But poor Balto isn't allowed to help out because of his wolf heritage. When the team is reported missing, Balto sets off on a daring quest to rescue them and get them home safely. This shows how courageous and determined he is to get the medicine to the sick children. That said, he is a very caring character and thats another reason why I really liked him. There's a bit of peril and emotional moments in this film, but plenty of comic relief is present to ease them, mostly involving Boris and Muk and Luk (the two polar bears). I personally liked the recurring gag when Kaltag hits Star in the head for saying something random. It gave me a smile each time. And the romantic moments of Balto and his girlfriend Jenna are extremely sweet indeed. Again, I found it sympathetic when Steele (the films ruthless antagonist) tries to spoil things for Balto by bullying him and trying to take Jenna from him. I found the animation to be very well done. With nice character designs and detailed Alaskan backdrops, all of which are well-drawn and gently animated, it allows to show how much work and effort Amblimation put into this traditionally animated masterpiece. James Horner's music is very atmospheric and dramatic and I liked how there were no random musical numbers to interrupt its flow. The voice acting is just as great. Bob Hoskins (as Boris) and Bridget Fonda (as Jenna) do a good job while Phil Collins voices Muk and Luk adorably and Jim Cummings is great as evil Steele. However, I would have to commend Kevin Bacon's performance for Balto. He voiced Balto sensibly. Not overacting, bland or hip, but he gave the character a more of a calm, humble, shy and likable personality similar to mine. Its another similarity me and Balto have. In conclusion, I would have to say that I absolutely adored Balto, and thats because of its great animation, story, casting and a protagonist who I could really relate to. I'm glad that I found out about this underrated classic and its a good thing others have too. If you like animation or dogs and you haven't seen it already, then I believe that Balto well deserves your attention. You will fall in love with it just like I did. Grade: "A"

    Balto (animated film) seems to be well liked by many. However many people do not know about the real life dog who helped save many children stricken with diphtheria. In the movie Balto looks nothing like the real life Balto did. The real Balto was a Siberian Husky and had no wolf in him. Balto's character always seems unsure of himself. Truly a shame seeing as the real Balto was a lot tougher. This Balto however only musters up enough courage to go and find the lost sled dog team that is carrying the vaccines to the sick only after learning that one of the stricken is Jenna's owner Rosy. Balto doesn't really care about the children, instead he seems more worried about Jenna whom he has affections for and goes to find the lost team only after this fact. Once Balto finds the team, gets rid of the antagonist of the film Steele and leads them back to save the sick. He is finally welcomed by the locals who once treated him as an outcast because of his wolf like traits, but since he is now the hero waiting in the wing everybody seems okay with it now that he's back with the medicine to save the children. Balto doesn't seem too ecstatic about this welcoming home party and instead would rather receive some attention from Jenna. The only thing I really loved about Balto was the villain Steele. Wonderfully voiced by Jim Cummings and perhaps the best developed character of the film. Other characters came off rather weak and could have used more in story development. Balto more than likely will be a bigger hit with young children and people who grew up on the film. However it may be more of a hit and miss with adults. Balto is not a bad film but it isn't great either. 4 out of 10

    Well I have watched Balto and its sequels when I was young. I think that the first one is best Balto movie. its just an amazing movie based on a true story about a wolf that saved some very sick child. its no where near as good as Coraline or Babe but its amazing movie to watch. The story is about Balto a wolf and haft dog who is a stray dog to people and gets bullied a lot by a dog called Steele but when Steele and the gang got lost in the snow Balto came to help them But Steele did not needed help but Balto took the gang threw the snow and made it back in one piece and he became a hero to people. the movie is just great who has not seen this movie before should watch because its amazing movie so if love dog films like Marley and me or All dogs go to heaven then this is a movie you should watch because its amazing I give this movie 8.3 out of 10 very good.

    I think it's obvious to see why Balto was ignored during it's theater release, coming out not to long after Toy Story (which is a better film). But I'm glad to see that it's popularity has grown in the 16 years since it's release. Balto is a half wolf, half dog that is basically an outcast in his town of Nome Alaska. When the children of the town develop a fatal disease, a sled team must go and receive medacine. Unfortunattly the team get's lost and now Balto must go find them and help them get the medicine back to Nome. I'm not going to lie and say the movie is flawless, the story is nothing new, the characters are kinda bland and the comedy reliefs are a little more annoying than funny, thankfully they don't follow Balto throughout his journey. With nice animation, a good cast, and a solid story, Balto is worth picking up.

    The way Balto is wrote, the way its animations were made, the way the story and it's main character plays and roles, makes Balto one heck of a touching movie. I know we are in 2011, but i only got to see this fantastic movie today (it wasn't released in my country, but i got the VHS from a friend). And it was 1 hour well spent! Kinda makes us think what an animal can do for us, even if we can't really talk to them! Even if a lot of people thinks that this kind of story is old, or too used, this movie is still awesome. I can put it side by side with Disney's greatest creations! I even thought the movie was made by Disney! Just like a bunch of people said back there, you MUST see it, only a person with no heart will not like this movie!

    How anyone could give this film anything but a 10 is beyond me. The animation is awesome. The plot, story and characters are fantastic and to top it off, this film is based on a true story. Balto actually existed. He was a hero and has his very own statue. I think the majority of kids, especially those who love animals will absolutely love this movie as well. The underlying message of this movie highlights the effects of racism/bigotry. Because Balto is a half-breed, he is treated as if he's less than or not good enough to hang out with the dogs who are full-blooded pedigrees. However, he's the one who comes to the towns rescue, although some of the townsfolk treated him bad as well. He's a true hero in every sense of the word. Awesome freaking' movie.

Current Disney is trash aside from some good work like Tangled and Princess And The Frog. - -. -- This is the section where there are possible spoilers. Read at your own risk -- The story is told by Rosy, all grown up and with a granddaughter. From there the animation takes over. Balto, whose mother was a wolf and father a dog, was an outcast among not only dogs but also humans. Due to his half wolf heritage he was thought to be wild with the humans, and most of the dogs thought he was beneath them for being only half dog and a stray. Enter Jenna. Kind and caring to all, even to Steele even though he didn't deserve it. She gave him hope that acceptance wasn't as scarce and limited to two polar bears and a goose. However, his luck changes for the better-- giving him a chance to prove himself to not only the dogs but to the humans as well. The town is hit by an epidemic of diphtheria. And, due to the snow, the medicine is delayed on all modern forms of transportation. The town has little option left and decides to send in the best sledding team to retrieve it from the last layover. Balto was not picked, obviously, but after the team leaves he sets off to find them because a huge snow storm is approaching. -- End of possible spoilers -- I won't go any further, or I'd risk truly spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet but is looking it up on IMDb to see if it's worth watching. This movie will always have a special place in my heart. The story has all the elements it needs. Drama, conflict, romance, etc. The cast selected to VA was amazingly picked. Kevin Bacon did a wonderful job, as did Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins, Jim Cummings an Phil Collins. And the score was excellent. James Horner is a master composer, his work with Titanic is one of his most popular works, it's a shame that this one isn't for it is on equal ground... at least in my opinion. There you have it. Great animation, a interesting and eye catching plot, an amazing cast and musical score. Few films, real live action or animated/CGI, can pull off all of them. Balto did. So if you've never seen it, I recommend you do so and don't judge it until you've watched everything start to finish. I'll always have a fondness for it, I hope after seeing it you will too. My rating: 10 Stars out of 10 Stars.

    I recently found Balto and watched it as it was a film I never watched the whole way through when I was younger and when I found out about it recently and then bought the DVD I have fallen in love with it. The animation and storyline is good and I love the majority of the characters, bar Dixie, Muk and Luk. If those three weren't in it, it would be a lot greater film in my opinion but it is still a good watch. Due to being overshadowed by Toy Story this film never really took off and is not so well known but it really should be because it is a great kids film with great characters and animation and a storyline that, as well as being true, is exciting and makes this film very watchable. 8/10 :)

    I was only one year old when Balto got released in theaters, but I didn't even hear about its existence until recently. I love animation, I love dogs and I felt sorry to hear that this film wasn't very popular when it was released, so I decided to watch it on DVD. What I got was an amazing, inspiring and heart warming animated film which turned out to be one of the best I've ever seen. I was surprised about how much I was connected to the main character Balto. Because he is portrayed as a husky-wolf hybrid, the people of Nome fear of him for being part-wolf, the wolf packs reject him for being part-husky and the other dogs make fun of him for it. As a result, he is an outcast who doesn't know where he belongs, and only relying on Boris, a goose who is afraid of heights to take care of him. I showed a lot of sympathy towards Balto because I've been in similar situations and seeing him being left out was very emotive. The story is loosely based on the true 1925 serum run in Alaska. A disease spreads onto the children of Nome and a snow storm cuts all transport from delivering medicine, so a team sled dogs are sent to pick it up. But poor Balto isn't allowed to help out because of his wolf heritage. When the team is reported missing, Balto sets off on a daring quest to rescue them and get them home safely. This shows how courageous and determined he is to get the medicine to the sick children. That said, he is a very caring character and thats another reason why I really liked him. There's a bit of peril and emotional moments in this film, but plenty of comic relief is present to ease them, mostly involving Boris and Muk and Luk (the two polar bears). I personally liked the recurring gag when Kaltag hits Star in the head for saying something random. It gave me a smile each time. And the romantic moments of Balto and his girlfriend Jenna are extremely sweet indeed. Again, I found it sympathetic when Steele (the films ruthless antagonist) tries to spoil things for Balto by bullying him and trying to take Jenna from him. I found the animation to be very well done. With nice character designs and detailed Alaskan backdrops, all of which are well-drawn and gently animated, it allows to show how much work and effort Amblimation put into this traditionally animated masterpiece. James Horner's music is very atmospheric and dramatic and I liked how there were no random musical numbers to interrupt its flow. The voice acting is just as great. Bob Hoskins (as Boris) and Bridget Fonda (as Jenna) do a good job while Phil Collins voices Muk and Luk adorably and Jim Cummings is great as evil Steele. However, I would have to commend Kevin Bacon's performance for Balto. He voiced Balto sensibly. Not overacting, bland or hip, but he gave the character a more of a calm, humble, shy and likable personality similar to mine. Its another similarity me and Balto have. In conclusion, I would have to say that I absolutely adored Balto, and thats because of its great animation, story, casting and a protagonist who I could really relate to. I'm glad that I found out about this underrated classic and its a good thing others have too. If you like animation or dogs and you haven't seen it already, then I believe that Balto well deserves your attention. You will fall in love with it just like I did. Grade: "A"

    Balto (animated film) seems to be well liked by many. However many people do not know about the real life dog who helped save many children stricken with diphtheria. In the movie Balto looks nothing like the real life Balto did. The real Balto was a Siberian Husky and had no wolf in him. Balto's character always seems unsure of himself. Truly a shame seeing as the real Balto was a lot tougher. This Balto however only musters up enough courage to go and find the lost sled dog team that is carrying the vaccines to the sick only after learning that one of the stricken is Jenna's owner Rosy. Balto doesn't really care about the children, instead he seems more worried about Jenna whom he has affections for and goes to find the lost team only after this fact. Once Balto finds the team, gets rid of the antagonist of the film Steele and leads them back to save the sick. He is finally welcomed by the locals who once treated him as an outcast because of his wolf like traits, but since he is now the hero waiting in the wing everybody seems okay with it now that he's back with the medicine to save the children. Balto doesn't seem too ecstatic about this welcoming home party and instead would rather receive some attention from Jenna. The only thing I really loved about Balto was the villain Steele. Wonderfully voiced by Jim Cummings and perhaps the best developed character of the film. Other characters came off rather weak and could have used more in story development. Balto more than likely will be a bigger hit with young children and people who grew up on the film. However it may be more of a hit and miss with adults. Balto is not a bad film but it isn't great either. 4 out of 10

    Well I have watched Balto and its sequels when I was young. I think that the first one is best Balto movie. its just an amazing movie based on a true story about a wolf that saved some very sick child. its no where near as good as Coraline or Babe but its amazing movie to watch. The story is about Balto a wolf and haft dog who is a stray dog to people and gets bullied a lot by a dog called Steele but when Steele and the gang got lost in the snow Balto came to help them But Steele did not needed help but Balto took the gang threw the snow and made it back in one piece and he became a hero to people. the movie is just great who has not seen this movie before should watch because its amazing movie so if love dog films like Marley and me or All dogs go to heaven then this is a movie you should watch because its amazing I give this movie 8.3 out of 10 very good.

    I think it's obvious to see why Balto was ignored during it's theater release, coming out not to long after Toy Story (which is a better film). But I'm glad to see that it's popularity has grown in the 16 years since it's release. Balto is a half wolf, half dog that is basically an outcast in his town of Nome Alaska. When the children of the town develop a fatal disease, a sled team must go and receive medacine. Unfortunattly the team get's lost and now Balto must go find them and help them get the medicine back to Nome. I'm not going to lie and say the movie is flawless, the story is nothing new, the characters are kinda bland and the comedy reliefs are a little more annoying than funny, thankfully they don't follow Balto throughout his journey. With nice animation, a good cast, and a solid story, Balto is worth picking up.

    The way Balto is wrote, the way its animations were made, the way the story and it's main character plays and roles, makes Balto one heck of a touching movie. I know we are in 2011, but i only got to see this fantastic movie today (it wasn't released in my country, but i got the VHS from a friend). And it was 1 hour well spent! Kinda makes us think what an animal can do for us, even if we can't really talk to them! Even if a lot of people thinks that this kind of story is old, or too used, this movie is still awesome. I can put it side by side with Disney's greatest creations! I even thought the movie was made by Disney! Just like a bunch of people said back there, you MUST see it, only a person with no heart will not like this movie!

    How anyone could give this film anything but a 10 is beyond me. The animation is awesome. The plot, story and characters are fantastic and to top it off, this film is based on a true story. Balto actually existed. He was a hero and has his very own statue. I think the majority of kids, especially those who love animals will absolutely love this movie as well. The underlying message of this movie highlights the effects of racism/bigotry. Because Balto is a half-breed, he is treated as if he's less than or not good enough to hang out with the dogs who are full-blooded pedigrees. However, he's the one who comes to the towns rescue, although some of the townsfolk treated him bad as well. He's a true hero in every sense of the word. Awesome freaking' movie.

    Balto is a spectacular film that is an underrated classic. I first saw Balto when I was young and loved it. The film opens with a grandmother walking with her granddaughter and their dog through Central Park, New York. The grandmother wants to show her granddaughter a memorial. They sit down and she begins to tell the story of Balto. The film then flashes back to 1925 in Nome, Alaska. Their we meet Balto, a wolf dog and his caretaker a Russian snow goose named Boris. They are in a rush to see the finish of a sled race. Their Balto sees Jenna, a husky and her owner a little girl named Rosy. The race is one by Steele, a proud and fierce Siberian husky. Steele, the other dogs and the people of Nome see Balto as an outcast due to his half breed status. Balto sneaks back into the city to see Jenna. They discover that the hospital is filled to a strange size and they listen to a meeting between the head doctor and Rosy's father. Diphtheria has spread to Nome and the hospital has run out of antitoxin. A message is sent through to Anchorage and a train is packed to bear the storm and stop at an outpost where a sled dog team will retrieve the medicine. Steele and his team leave but are lost on their way back. Balto and his friends set out to find the lost team. Jenna gets injured and his friends bring her back to Nome while Balto goes alone. Balto is now on a life journey to bring back the toxin before the Diphtheria becomes fatile. The voices in Balto are well selected. We have Kevin Bacon voicing Balto, Bridget Fonda as Jenna, Bob Hoskins as Boris and Jim Cummings as Steele. Miriam Margoyles is also worthy of recognition for playing the grandmother in the beginning and end of the film. The reason why Balto is so good is how serious it can take itself. Their is good occasional comedy but the film does have a dark story line and accompanies it with some dark images. The main character is great. If I were to pick an animated character who resembles me, one of them would be Balto. The side characters are also good characters. Jim Cummings voices Steele who has pride and he will do whatever he can to defend it. He is more of a jerk then a villain and I appreciate the movie for this. The film is also well directed by the underrated Simon Wells who went on to make another classic, The Prince of Egypt. The scenery is brilliant for the film and it still takes my breath away. The ending is just amazing. If people decide to watch Balto, they need to listen to the song at the end "Reach for the Light" sung by Steve Winewood. It gives me goosebumps every time that I hear it. One other comment I should make about Balto is that the film does take itself quite seriously. I don't want to give away some of these themes but you will be surprised by this film especially if you look at the other animated movies that came out before it. Don't get me wrong there are some light hearted comedic moments but the film does keep its intensity and atmosphere. The film's strength lies in its atmosphere and the character of Balto. So many animated movies at this time try to focus on side characters but fail to develop the main character. This film does this very well. I will continue to watch this film via DVD that I recently purchased. The story that you see is true. Of course, some things have been changed but the bravery of the sled dogs led by Balto saved countless lives and the film honours them well. This is among my favourite movies of all time and that will not change. If you like 2D animated films, Balto is one of the best.

    It's rare that one finds an animated movie that has so much heart that isn't connected to Disney. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any others that stand out than this movie. Balto (1995), was loosely based off the real life events of an actual husky dog of the same name. The only difference is that the story was changed slightly to give the character of Balto a little more background. That is why it's loosely based off the actual events. Kudos to the four writers because it made this movie very enjoyable. Here, Balto lives on the edge of a town because he's not a husky. Yet somehow, everyone in the town, including the humans know his name? How is this possible (this is really the only thing I didn't understand)? His ancestry comes from dog/wolf, which leaves him in a bad spot because no one wants to trust him and the snooty pure bread husky dogs don't want a mutt joining their dog team. What Balto dreams most of, is running with the husky dogs and pulling the sleds they pull. And little does he know, but his chance will come sooner than he thinks, when a virus breakout comes on the town and he decides to fetch the medicine for the sick. The cast in this film is horrendously good too. Kevin Bacon voices our hero, Balto. Bacon is able to make his role really sound courageous and emotional when it needs to be and that's good. Voicing his love interest is Bridget Fonda as a little girl's husky named Jenna. Even if this is Fonda's first time doing voice acting, she did a great job. She knows how to give Jenna the right tone of voice and emotion at the same time. And I got to admit, Jenna and Balto make an adorable dog couple. Thank you animation department! Let's also not forget our antagonist named Steele voiced by famous voice actor, Jim Cummings. Cummings, who can do this work in his sleep, also gives a convincing performance as the thickheaded, husky with way too much hubris. And along with Steele are always the knuckle head followers of the antagonist. All of which have their own quirkiness about them, which make them funny. But that's not all. Accompanying Balto on his travels are three other friends. Two are a duo of polar bears named Muk and Luk, which are both voiced by musician Phil Collins. Surprisingly, even Collins gives a memorable performance. But the character I found the most entertaining when it came to comic relief was Boris the goose (the other friend) played by Bob Hoskins. Boris is such a great character because of how well he knows Balto and the problems that he faces. It is because of that, that he does his best to make sure his closest friend is in good hands. If you don't fall for Boris, I don't know what will. The art department did a nice job at keeping the view big and broad. Since the setting was in Alaska, it is only respective that the picture be epic looking. Mainly because, Alaska is epic period. Also I like the sounds a lot. Cracking ice to crunching snow. The one sound that I got chills from was hearing the wolves howl. I couldn't stop from getting goosebumps. I have no clue why but it gave me the shivers and that made me like it more. Adding to that was the soundtrack provided by composer James Horner and boy did it work. Excluding a few previous works that Horner has made that were mishaps, Horner really knows how to evoke the right emotions at the right time. It made watching Balto fun and invigorating. The characters alone is what makes the cake in this movie. The icing to the cake is James Horner's music, the grand backgrounds and involving sound effects.

    I think it's obvious to see why Balto was ignored during it's theater release, coming out not to long after Toy Story (which is a better film). But I'm glad to see that it's popularity has grown in the 16 years since it's release. Balto is a half wolf, half dog that is basically an outcast in his town of Nome Alaska. When the children of the town develop a fatal disease, a sled team must go and receive medacine. Unfortunattly the team get's lost and now Balto must go find them and help them get the medicine back to Nome. I'm not going to lie and say the movie is flawless, the story is nothing new, the characters are kinda bland and the comedy reliefs are a little more annoying than funny, thankfully they don't follow Balto throughout his journey. With nice animation, a good cast, and a solid story, Balto is worth picking up.

    The way Balto is wrote, the way its animations were made, the way the story and it's main character plays and roles, makes Balto one heck of a touching movie. I know we are in 2011, but i only got to see this fantastic movie today (it wasn't released in my country, but i got the VHS from a friend). And it was 1 hour well spent! Kinda makes us think what an animal can do for us, even if we can't really talk to them! Even if a lot of people thinks that this kind of story is old, or too used, this movie is still awesome. I can put it side by side with Disney's greatest creations! I even thought the movie was made by Disney! Just like a bunch of people said back there, you MUST see it, only a person with no heart will not like this movie!

    How anyone could give this film anything but a 10 is beyond me. The animation is awesome. The plot, story and characters are fantastic and to top it off, this film is based on a true story. Balto actually existed. He was a hero and has his very own statue. I think the majority of kids, especially those who love animals will absolutely love this movie as well. The underlying message of this movie highlights the effects of racism/bigotry. Because Balto is a half-breed, he is treated as if he's less than or not good enough to hang out with the dogs who are full-blooded pedigrees. However, he's the one who comes to the towns rescue, although some of the townsfolk treated him bad as well. He's a true hero in every sense of the word. Awesome freaking' movie.

    Balto is a spectacular film that is an underrated classic. I first saw Balto when I was young and loved it. The film opens with a grandmother walking with her granddaughter and their dog through Central Park, New York. The grandmother wants to show her granddaughter a memorial. They sit down and she begins to tell the story of Balto. The film then flashes back to 1925 in Nome, Alaska. Their we meet Balto, a wolf dog and his caretaker a Russian snow goose named Boris. They are in a rush to see the finish of a sled race. Their Balto sees Jenna, a husky and her owner a little girl named Rosy. The race is one by Steele, a proud and fierce Siberian husky. Steele, the other dogs and the people of Nome see Balto as an outcast due to his half breed status. Balto sneaks back into the city to see Jenna. They discover that the hospital is filled to a strange size and they listen to a meeting between the head doctor and Rosy's father. Diphtheria has spread to Nome and the hospital has run out of antitoxin. A message is sent through to Anchorage and a train is packed to bear the storm and stop at an outpost where a sled dog team will retrieve the medicine. Steele and his team leave but are lost on their way back. Balto and his friends set out to find the lost team. Jenna gets injured and his friends bring her back to Nome while Balto goes alone. Balto is now on a life journey to bring back the toxin before the Diphtheria becomes fatile. The voices in Balto are well selected. We have Kevin Bacon voicing Balto, Bridget Fonda as Jenna, Bob Hoskins as Boris and Jim Cummings as Steele. Miriam Margoyles is also worthy of recognition for playing the grandmother in the beginning and end of the film. The reason why Balto is so good is how serious it can take itself. Their is good occasional comedy but the film does have a dark story line and accompanies it with some dark images. The main character is great. If I were to pick an animated character who resembles me, one of them would be Balto. The side characters are also good characters. Jim Cummings voices Steele who has pride and he will do whatever he can to defend it. He is more of a jerk then a villain and I appreciate the movie for this. The film is also well directed by the underrated Simon Wells who went on to make another classic, The Prince of Egypt. The scenery is brilliant for the film and it still takes my breath away. The ending is just amazing. If people decide to watch Balto, they need to listen to the song at the end "Reach for the Light" sung by Steve Winewood. It gives me goosebumps every time that I hear it. One other comment I should make about Balto is that the film does take itself quite seriously. I don't want to give away some of these themes but you will be surprised by this film especially if you look at the other animated movies that came out before it. Don't get me wrong there are some light hearted comedic moments but the film does keep its intensity and atmosphere. The film's strength lies in its atmosphere and the character of Balto. So many animated movies at this time try to focus on side characters but fail to develop the main character. This film does this very well. I will continue to watch this film via DVD that I recently purchased. The story that you see is true. Of course, some things have been changed but the bravery of the sled dogs led by Balto saved countless lives and the film honours them well. This is among my favourite movies of all time and that will not change. If you like 2D animated films, Balto is one of the best.

    It's rare that one finds an animated movie that has so much heart that isn't connected to Disney. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any others that stand out than this movie. Balto (1995), was loosely based off the real life events of an actual husky dog of the same name. The only difference is that the story was changed slightly to give the character of Balto a little more background. That is why it's loosely based off the actual events. Kudos to the four writers because it made this movie very enjoyable. Here, Balto lives on the edge of a town because he's not a husky. Yet somehow, everyone in the town, including the humans know his name? How is this possible (this is really the only thing I didn't understand)? His ancestry comes from dog/wolf, which leaves him in a bad spot because no one wants to trust him and the snooty pure bread husky dogs don't want a mutt joining their dog team. What Balto dreams most of, is running with the husky dogs and pulling the sleds they pull. And little does he know, but his chance will come sooner than he thinks, when a virus breakout comes on the town and he decides to fetch the medicine for the sick. The cast in this film is horrendously good too. Kevin Bacon voices our hero, Balto. Bacon is able to make his role really sound courageous and emotional when it needs to be and that's good. Voicing his love interest is Bridget Fonda as a little girl's husky named Jenna. Even if this is Fonda's first time doing voice acting, she did a great job. She knows how to give Jenna the right tone of voice and emotion at the same time. And I got to admit, Jenna and Balto make an adorable dog couple. Thank you animation department! Let's also not forget our antagonist named Steele voiced by famous voice actor, Jim Cummings. Cummings, who can do this work in his sleep, also gives a convincing performance as the thickheaded, husky with way too much hubris. And along with Steele are always the knuckle head followers of the antagonist. All of which have their own quirkiness about them, which make them funny. But that's not all. Accompanying Balto on his travels are three other friends. Two are a duo of polar bears named Muk and Luk, which are both voiced by musician Phil Collins. Surprisingly, even Collins gives a memorable performance. But the character I found the most entertaining when it came to comic relief was Boris the goose (the other friend) played by Bob Hoskins. Boris is such a great character because of how well he knows Balto and the problems that he faces. It is because of that, that he does his best to make sure his closest friend is in good hands. If you don't fall for Boris, I don't know what will. The art department did a nice job at keeping the view big and broad. Since the setting was in Alaska, it is only respective that the picture be epic looking. Mainly because, Alaska is epic period. Also I like the sounds a lot. Cracking ice to crunching snow. The one sound that I got chills from was hearing the wolves howl. I couldn't stop from getting goosebumps. I have no clue why but it gave me the shivers and that made me like it more. Adding to that was the soundtrack provided by composer James Horner and boy did it work. Excluding a few previous works that Horner has made that were mishaps, Horner really knows how to evoke the right emotions at the right time. It made watching Balto fun and invigorating. The characters alone is what makes the cake in this movie. The icing to the cake is James Horner's music, the grand backgrounds and involving sound effects.

    This movie's rating on IMDb is far too low. I didn't know this movie was so underrated. When it comes to animated movies, Disney is at the top of the food chain and Pixar comes in at a close second. So it's amazing that this non-Disney, animated film surpasses even some Disney movies -- I don't count the movies like High School Musical. Current Disney is trash aside from some good work like Tangled and Princess And The Frog. - -. -- This is the section where there are possible spoilers. Read at your own risk -- The story is told by Rosy, all grown up and with a granddaughter. From there the animation takes over. Balto, whose mother was a wolf and father a dog, was an outcast among not only dogs but also humans. Due to his half wolf heritage he was thought to be wild with the humans, and most of the dogs thought he was beneath them for being only half dog and a stray. Enter Jenna. Kind and caring to all, even to Steele even though he didn't deserve it. She gave him hope that acceptance wasn't as scarce and limited to two polar bears and a goose. However, his luck changes for the better-- giving him a chance to prove himself to not only the dogs but to the humans as well. The town is hit by an epidemic of diphtheria. And, due to the snow, the medicine is delayed on all modern forms of transportation. The town has little option left and decides to send in the best sledding team to retrieve it from the last layover. Balto was not picked, obviously, but after the team leaves he sets off to find them because a huge snow storm is approaching. -- End of possible spoilers -- I won't go any further, or I'd risk truly spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet but is looking it up on IMDb to see if it's worth watching. This movie will always have a special place in my heart. The story has all the elements it needs. Drama, conflict, romance, etc. The cast selected to VA was amazingly picked. Kevin Bacon did a wonderful job, as did Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins, Jim Cummings an Phil Collins. And the score was excellent. James Horner is a master composer, his work with Titanic is one of his most popular works, it's a shame that this one isn't for it is on equal ground... at least in my opinion. There you have it. Great animation, a interesting and eye catching plot, an amazing cast and musical score. Few films, real live action or animated/CGI, can pull off all of them. Balto did. So if you've never seen it, I recommend you do so and don't judge it until you've watched everything start to finish. I'll always have a fondness for it, I hope after seeing it you will too. My rating: 10 Stars out of 10 Stars.

    I recently found Balto and watched it as it was a film I never watched the whole way through when I was younger and when I found out about it recently and then bought the DVD I have fallen in love with it. The animation and storyline is good and I love the majority of the characters, bar Dixie, Muk and Luk. If those three weren't in it, it would be a lot greater film in my opinion but it is still a good watch. Due to being overshadowed by Toy Story this film never really took off and is not so well known but it really should be because it is a great kids film with great characters and animation and a storyline that, as well as being true, is exciting and makes this film very watchable. 8/10 :)

    I was only one year old when Balto got released in theaters, but I didn't even hear about its existence until recently. I love animation, I love dogs and I felt sorry to hear that this film wasn't very popular when it was released, so I decided to watch it on DVD. What I got was an amazing, inspiring and heart warming animated film which turned out to be one of the best I've ever seen. I was surprised about how much I was connected to the main character Balto. Because he is portrayed as a husky-wolf hybrid, the people of Nome fear of him for being part-wolf, the wolf packs reject him for being part-husky and the other dogs make fun of him for it. As a result, he is an outcast who doesn't know where he belongs, and only relying on Boris, a goose who is afraid of heights to take care of him. I showed a lot of sympathy towards Balto because I've been in similar situations and seeing him being left out was very emotive. The story is loosely based on the true 1925 serum run in Alaska. A disease spreads onto the children of Nome and a snow storm cuts all transport from delivering medicine, so a team sled dogs are sent to pick it up. But poor Balto isn't allowed to help out because of his wolf heritage. When the team is reported missing, Balto sets off on a daring quest to rescue them and get them home safely. This shows how courageous and determined he is to get the medicine to the sick children. That said, he is a very caring character and thats another reason why I really liked him. There's a bit of peril and emotional moments in this film, but plenty of comic relief is present to ease them, mostly involving Boris and Muk and Luk (the two polar bears). I personally liked the recurring gag when Kaltag hits Star in the head for saying something random. It gave me a smile each time. And the romantic moments of Balto and his girlfriend Jenna are extremely sweet indeed. Again, I found it sympathetic when Steele (the films ruthless antagonist) tries to spoil things for Balto by bullying him and trying to take Jenna from him. I found the animation to be very well done. With nice character designs and detailed Alaskan backdrops, all of which are well-drawn and gently animated, it allows to show how much work and effort Amblimation put into this traditionally animated masterpiece. James Horner's music is very atmospheric and dramatic and I liked how there were no random musical numbers to interrupt its flow. The voice acting is just as great. Bob Hoskins (as Boris) and Bridget Fonda (as Jenna) do a good job while Phil Collins voices Muk and Luk adorably and Jim Cummings is great as evil Steele. However, I would have to commend Kevin Bacon's performance for Balto. He voiced Balto sensibly. Not overacting, bland or hip, but he gave the character a more of a calm, humble, shy and likable personality similar to mine. Its another similarity me and Balto have. In conclusion, I would have to say that I absolutely adored Balto, and thats because of its great animation, story, casting and a protagonist who I could really relate to. I'm glad that I found out about this underrated classic and its a good thing others have too. If you like animation or dogs and you haven't seen it already, then I believe that Balto well deserves your attention. You will fall in love with it just like I did. Grade: "A"

    Balto (animated film) seems to be well liked by many. However many people do not know about the real life dog who helped save many children stricken with diphtheria. In the movie Balto looks nothing like the real life Balto did. The real Balto was a Siberian Husky and had no wolf in him. Balto's character always seems unsure of himself. Truly a shame seeing as the real Balto was a lot tougher. This Balto however only musters up enough courage to go and find the lost sled dog team that is carrying the vaccines to the sick only after learning that one of the stricken is Jenna's owner Rosy. Balto doesn't really care about the children, instead he seems more worried about Jenna whom he has affections for and goes to find the lost team only after this fact. Once Balto finds the team, gets rid of the antagonist of the film Steele and leads them back to save the sick. He is finally welcomed by the locals who once treated him as an outcast because of his wolf like traits, but since he is now the hero waiting in the wing everybody seems okay with it now that he's back with the medicine to save the children. Balto doesn't seem too ecstatic about this welcoming home party and instead would rather receive some attention from Jenna. The only thing I really loved about Balto was the villain Steele. Wonderfully voiced by Jim Cummings and perhaps the best developed character of the film. Other characters came off rather weak and could have used more in story development. Balto more than likely will be a bigger hit with young children and people who grew up on the film. However it may be more of a hit and miss with adults. Balto is not a bad film but it isn't great either. 4 out of 10

    Well I have watched Balto and its sequels when I was young. I think that the first one is best Balto movie. its just an amazing movie based on a true story about a wolf that saved some very sick child. its no where near as good as Coraline or Babe but its amazing movie to watch. The story is about Balto a wolf and haft dog who is a stray dog to people and gets bullied a lot by a dog called Steele but when Steele and the gang got lost in the snow Balto came to help them But Steele did not needed help but Balto took the gang threw the snow and made it back in one piece and he became a hero to people. the movie is just great who has not seen this movie before should watch because its amazing movie so if love dog films like Marley and me or All dogs go to heaven then this is a movie you should watch because its amazing I give this movie 8.3 out of 10 very good.

The one sound that I got chills from was hearing the wolves howl. I couldn't stop from getting goosebumps. I have no clue why but it gave me the shivers and that made me like it more. Adding to that was the soundtrack provided by composer James Horner and boy did it work. Excluding a few previous works that Horner has made that were mishaps, Horner really knows how to evoke the right emotions at the right time. It made watching Balto fun and invigorating. The characters alone is what makes the cake in this movie. The icing to the cake is James Horner's music, the grand backgrounds and involving sound effects.

    This movie's rating on IMDb is far too low. I didn't know this movie was so underrated. When it comes to animated movies, Disney is at the top of the food chain and Pixar comes in at a close second. So it's amazing that this non-Disney, animated film surpasses even some Disney movies -- I don't count the movies like High School Musical. Current Disney is trash aside from some good work like Tangled and Princess And The Frog. - -. -- This is the section where there are possible spoilers. Read at your own risk -- The story is told by Rosy, all grown up and with a granddaughter. From there the animation takes over. Balto, whose mother was a wolf and father a dog, was an outcast among not only dogs but also humans. Due to his half wolf heritage he was thought to be wild with the humans, and most of the dogs thought he was beneath them for being only half dog and a stray. Enter Jenna. Kind and caring to all, even to Steele even though he didn't deserve it. She gave him hope that acceptance wasn't as scarce and limited to two polar bears and a goose. However, his luck changes for the better-- giving him a chance to prove himself to not only the dogs but to the humans as well. The town is hit by an epidemic of diphtheria. And, due to the snow, the medicine is delayed on all modern forms of transportation. The town has little option left and decides to send in the best sledding team to retrieve it from the last layover. Balto was not picked, obviously, but after the team leaves he sets off to find them because a huge snow storm is approaching. -- End of possible spoilers -- I won't go any further, or I'd risk truly spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet but is looking it up on IMDb to see if it's worth watching. This movie will always have a special place in my heart. The story has all the elements it needs. Drama, conflict, romance, etc. The cast selected to VA was amazingly picked. Kevin Bacon did a wonderful job, as did Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins, Jim Cummings an Phil Collins. And the score was excellent. James Horner is a master composer, his work with Titanic is one of his most popular works, it's a shame that this one isn't for it is on equal ground... at least in my opinion. There you have it. Great animation, a interesting and eye catching plot, an amazing cast and musical score. Few films, real live action or animated/CGI, can pull off all of them. Balto did. So if you've never seen it, I recommend you do so and don't judge it until you've watched everything start to finish. I'll always have a fondness for it, I hope after seeing it you will too. My rating: 10 Stars out of 10 Stars.

    I recently found Balto and watched it as it was a film I never watched the whole way through when I was younger and when I found out about it recently and then bought the DVD I have fallen in love with it. The animation and storyline is good and I love the majority of the characters, bar Dixie, Muk and Luk. If those three weren't in it, it would be a lot greater film in my opinion but it is still a good watch. Due to being overshadowed by Toy Story this film never really took off and is not so well known but it really should be because it is a great kids film with great characters and animation and a storyline that, as well as being true, is exciting and makes this film very watchable. 8/10 :)

    I was only one year old when Balto got released in theaters, but I didn't even hear about its existence until recently. I love animation, I love dogs and I felt sorry to hear that this film wasn't very popular when it was released, so I decided to watch it on DVD. What I got was an amazing, inspiring and heart warming animated film which turned out to be one of the best I've ever seen. I was surprised about how much I was connected to the main character Balto. Because he is portrayed as a husky-wolf hybrid, the people of Nome fear of him for being part-wolf, the wolf packs reject him for being part-husky and the other dogs make fun of him for it. As a result, he is an outcast who doesn't know where he belongs, and only relying on Boris, a goose who is afraid of heights to take care of him. I showed a lot of sympathy towards Balto because I've been in similar situations and seeing him being left out was very emotive. The story is loosely based on the true 1925 serum run in Alaska. A disease spreads onto the children of Nome and a snow storm cuts all transport from delivering medicine, so a team sled dogs are sent to pick it up. But poor Balto isn't allowed to help out because of his wolf heritage. When the team is reported missing, Balto sets off on a daring quest to rescue them and get them home safely. This shows how courageous and determined he is to get the medicine to the sick children. That said, he is a very caring character and thats another reason why I really liked him. There's a bit of peril and emotional moments in this film, but plenty of comic relief is present to ease them, mostly involving Boris and Muk and Luk (the two polar bears). I personally liked the recurring gag when Kaltag hits Star in the head for saying something random. It gave me a smile each time. And the romantic moments of Balto and his girlfriend Jenna are extremely sweet indeed. Again, I found it sympathetic when Steele (the films ruthless antagonist) tries to spoil things for Balto by bullying him and trying to take Jenna from him. I found the animation to be very well done. With nice character designs and detailed Alaskan backdrops, all of which are well-drawn and gently animated, it allows to show how much work and effort Amblimation put into this traditionally animated masterpiece. James Horner's music is very atmospheric and dramatic and I liked how there were no random musical numbers to interrupt its flow. The voice acting is just as great. Bob Hoskins (as Boris) and Bridget Fonda (as Jenna) do a good job while Phil Collins voices Muk and Luk adorably and Jim Cummings is great as evil Steele. However, I would have to commend Kevin Bacon's performance for Balto. He voiced Balto sensibly. Not overacting, bland or hip, but he gave the character a more of a calm, humble, shy and likable personality similar to mine. Its another similarity me and Balto have. In conclusion, I would have to say that I absolutely adored Balto, and thats because of its great animation, story, casting and a protagonist who I could really relate to. I'm glad that I found out about this underrated classic and its a good thing others have too. If you like animation or dogs and you haven't seen it already, then I believe that Balto well deserves your attention. You will fall in love with it just like I did. Grade: "A"

    Balto (animated film) seems to be well liked by many. However many people do not know about the real life dog who helped save many children stricken with diphtheria. In the movie Balto looks nothing like the real life Balto did. The real Balto was a Siberian Husky and had no wolf in him. Balto's character always seems unsure of himself. Truly a shame seeing as the real Balto was a lot tougher. This Balto however only musters up enough courage to go and find the lost sled dog team that is carrying the vaccines to the sick only after learning that one of the stricken is Jenna's owner Rosy. Balto doesn't really care about the children, instead he seems more worried about Jenna whom he has affections for and goes to find the lost team only after this fact. Once Balto finds the team, gets rid of the antagonist of the film Steele and leads them back to save the sick. He is finally welcomed by the locals who once treated him as an outcast because of his wolf like traits, but since he is now the hero waiting in the wing everybody seems okay with it now that he's back with the medicine to save the children. Balto doesn't seem too ecstatic about this welcoming home party and instead would rather receive some attention from Jenna. The only thing I really loved about Balto was the villain Steele. Wonderfully voiced by Jim Cummings and perhaps the best developed character of the film. Other characters came off rather weak and could have used more in story development. Balto more than likely will be a bigger hit with young children and people who grew up on the film. However it may be more of a hit and miss with adults. Balto is not a bad film but it isn't great either. 4 out of 10

    Well I have watched Balto and its sequels when I was young. I think that the first one is best Balto movie. its just an amazing movie based on a true story about a wolf that saved some very sick child. its no where near as good as Coraline or Babe but its amazing movie to watch. The story is about Balto a wolf and haft dog who is a stray dog to people and gets bullied a lot by a dog called Steele but when Steele and the gang got lost in the snow Balto came to help them But Steele did not needed help but Balto took the gang threw the snow and made it back in one piece and he became a hero to people. the movie is just great who has not seen this movie before should watch because its amazing movie so if love dog films like Marley and me or All dogs go to heaven then this is a movie you should watch because its amazing I give this movie 8.3 out of 10 very good.

    I think it's obvious to see why Balto was ignored during it's theater release, coming out not to long after Toy Story (which is a better film). But I'm glad to see that it's popularity has grown in the 16 years since it's release. Balto is a half wolf, half dog that is basically an outcast in his town of Nome Alaska. When the children of the town develop a fatal disease, a sled team must go and receive medacine. Unfortunattly the team get's lost and now Balto must go find them and help them get the medicine back to Nome. I'm not going to lie and say the movie is flawless, the story is nothing new, the characters are kinda bland and the comedy reliefs are a little more annoying than funny, thankfully they don't follow Balto throughout his journey. With nice animation, a good cast, and a solid story, Balto is worth picking up.

    The way Balto is wrote, the way its animations were made, the way the story and it's main character plays and roles, makes Balto one heck of a touching movie. I know we are in 2011, but i only got to see this fantastic movie today (it wasn't released in my country, but i got the VHS from a friend). And it was 1 hour well spent! Kinda makes us think what an animal can do for us, even if we can't really talk to them! Even if a lot of people thinks that this kind of story is old, or too used, this movie is still awesome. I can put it side by side with Disney's greatest creations! I even thought the movie was made by Disney! Just like a bunch of people said back there, you MUST see it, only a person with no heart will not like this movie!

    How anyone could give this film anything but a 10 is beyond me. The animation is awesome. The plot, story and characters are fantastic and to top it off, this film is based on a true story. Balto actually existed. He was a hero and has his very own statue. I think the majority of kids, especially those who love animals will absolutely love this movie as well. The underlying message of this movie highlights the effects of racism/bigotry. Because Balto is a half-breed, he is treated as if he's less than or not good enough to hang out with the dogs who are full-blooded pedigrees. However, he's the one who comes to the towns rescue, although some of the townsfolk treated him bad as well. He's a true hero in every sense of the word. Awesome freaking' movie.

    Balto is a spectacular film that is an underrated classic. I first saw Balto when I was young and loved it. The film opens with a grandmother walking with her granddaughter and their dog through Central Park, New York. The grandmother wants to show her granddaughter a memorial. They sit down and she begins to tell the story of Balto. The film then flashes back to 1925 in Nome, Alaska. Their we meet Balto, a wolf dog and his caretaker a Russian snow goose named Boris. They are in a rush to see the finish of a sled race. Their Balto sees Jenna, a husky and her owner a little girl named Rosy. The race is one by Steele, a proud and fierce Siberian husky. Steele, the other dogs and the people of Nome see Balto as an outcast due to his half breed status. Balto sneaks back into the city to see Jenna. They discover that the hospital is filled to a strange size and they listen to a meeting between the head doctor and Rosy's father. Diphtheria has spread to Nome and the hospital has run out of antitoxin. A message is sent through to Anchorage and a train is packed to bear the storm and stop at an outpost where a sled dog team will retrieve the medicine. Steele and his team leave but are lost on their way back. Balto and his friends set out to find the lost team. Jenna gets injured and his friends bring her back to Nome while Balto goes alone. Balto is now on a life journey to bring back the toxin before the Diphtheria becomes fatile. The voices in Balto are well selected. We have Kevin Bacon voicing Balto, Bridget Fonda as Jenna, Bob Hoskins as Boris and Jim Cummings as Steele. Miriam Margoyles is also worthy of recognition for playing the grandmother in the beginning and end of the film. The reason why Balto is so good is how serious it can take itself. Their is good occasional comedy but the film does have a dark story line and accompanies it with some dark images. The main character is great. If I were to pick an animated character who resembles me, one of them would be Balto. The side characters are also good characters. Jim Cummings voices Steele who has pride and he will do whatever he can to defend it. He is more of a jerk then a villain and I appreciate the movie for this. The film is also well directed by the underrated Simon Wells who went on to make another classic, The Prince of Egypt. The scenery is brilliant for the film and it still takes my breath away. The ending is just amazing. If people decide to watch Balto, they need to listen to the song at the end "Reach for the Light" sung by Steve Winewood. It gives me goosebumps every time that I hear it. One other comment I should make about Balto is that the film does take itself quite seriously. I don't want to give away some of these themes but you will be surprised by this film especially if you look at the other animated movies that came out before it. Don't get me wrong there are some light hearted comedic moments but the film does keep its intensity and atmosphere. The film's strength lies in its atmosphere and the character of Balto. So many animated movies at this time try to focus on side characters but fail to develop the main character. This film does this very well. I will continue to watch this film via DVD that I recently purchased. The story that you see is true. Of course, some things have been changed but the bravery of the sled dogs led by Balto saved countless lives and the film honours them well. This is among my favourite movies of all time and that will not change. If you like 2D animated films, Balto is one of the best.

    It's rare that one finds an animated movie that has so much heart that isn't connected to Disney. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any others that stand out than this movie. Balto (1995), was loosely based off the real life events of an actual husky dog of the same name. The only difference is that the story was changed slightly to give the character of Balto a little more background. That is why it's loosely based off the actual events. Kudos to the four writers because it made this movie very enjoyable. Here, Balto lives on the edge of a town because he's not a husky. Yet somehow, everyone in the town, including the humans know his name? How is this possible (this is really the only thing I didn't understand)? His ancestry comes from dog/wolf, which leaves him in a bad spot because no one wants to trust him and the snooty pure bread husky dogs don't want a mutt joining their dog team. What Balto dreams most of, is running with the husky dogs and pulling the sleds they pull. And little does he know, but his chance will come sooner than he thinks, when a virus breakout comes on the town and he decides to fetch the medicine for the sick. The cast in this film is horrendously good too. Kevin Bacon voices our hero, Balto. Bacon is able to make his role really sound courageous and emotional when it needs to be and that's good. Voicing his love interest is Bridget Fonda as a little girl's husky named Jenna. Even if this is Fonda's first time doing voice acting, she did a great job. She knows how to give Jenna the right tone of voice and emotion at the same time. And I got to admit, Jenna and Balto make an adorable dog couple. Thank you animation department! Let's also not forget our antagonist named Steele voiced by famous voice actor, Jim Cummings. Cummings, who can do this work in his sleep, also gives a convincing performance as the thickheaded, husky with way too much hubris. And along with Steele are always the knuckle head followers of the antagonist. All of which have their own quirkiness about them, which make them funny. But that's not all. Accompanying Balto on his travels are three other friends. Two are a duo of polar bears named Muk and Luk, which are both voiced by musician Phil Collins. Surprisingly, even Collins gives a memorable performance. But the character I found the most entertaining when it came to comic relief was Boris the goose (the other friend) played by Bob Hoskins. Boris is such a great character because of how well he knows Balto and the problems that he faces. It is because of that, that he does his best to make sure his closest friend is in good hands. If you don't fall for Boris, I don't know what will. The art department did a nice job at keeping the view big and broad. Since the setting was in Alaska, it is only respective that the picture be epic looking. Mainly because, Alaska is epic period. Also I like the sounds a lot. Cracking ice to crunching snow. The one sound that I got chills from was hearing the wolves howl. I couldn't stop from getting goosebumps. I have no clue why but it gave me the shivers and that made me like it more. Adding to that was the soundtrack provided by composer James Horner and boy did it work. Excluding a few previous works that Horner has made that were mishaps, Horner really knows how to evoke the right emotions at the right time. It made watching Balto fun and invigorating. The characters alone is what makes the cake in this movie. The icing to the cake is James Horner's music, the grand backgrounds and involving sound effects.

    Well I have watched Balto and its sequels when I was young. I think that the first one is best Balto movie. its just an amazing movie based on a true story about a wolf that saved some very sick child. its no where near as good as Coraline or Babe but its amazing movie to watch. The story is about Balto a wolf and haft dog who is a stray dog to people and gets bullied a lot by a dog called Steele but when Steele and the gang got lost in the snow Balto came to help them But Steele did not needed help but Balto took the gang threw the snow and made it back in one piece and he became a hero to people. the movie is just great who has not seen this movie before should watch because its amazing movie so if love dog films like Marley and me or All dogs go to heaven then this is a movie you should watch because its amazing I give this movie 8.3 out of 10 very good.

    I think it's obvious to see why Balto was ignored during it's theater release, coming out not to long after Toy Story (which is a better film). But I'm glad to see that it's popularity has grown in the 16 years since it's release. Balto is a half wolf, half dog that is basically an outcast in his town of Nome Alaska. When the children of the town develop a fatal disease, a sled team must go and receive medacine. Unfortunattly the team get's lost and now Balto must go find them and help them get the medicine back to Nome. I'm not going to lie and say the movie is flawless, the story is nothing new, the characters are kinda bland and the comedy reliefs are a little more annoying than funny, thankfully they don't follow Balto throughout his journey. With nice animation, a good cast, and a solid story, Balto is worth picking up.

    The way Balto is wrote, the way its animations were made, the way the story and it's main character plays and roles, makes Balto one heck of a touching movie. I know we are in 2011, but i only got to see this fantastic movie today (it wasn't released in my country, but i got the VHS from a friend). And it was 1 hour well spent! Kinda makes us think what an animal can do for us, even if we can't really talk to them! Even if a lot of people thinks that this kind of story is old, or too used, this movie is still awesome. I can put it side by side with Disney's greatest creations! I even thought the movie was made by Disney! Just like a bunch of people said back there, you MUST see it, only a person with no heart will not like this movie!

    How anyone could give this film anything but a 10 is beyond me. The animation is awesome. The plot, story and characters are fantastic and to top it off, this film is based on a true story. Balto actually existed. He was a hero and has his very own statue. I think the majority of kids, especially those who love animals will absolutely love this movie as well. The underlying message of this movie highlights the effects of racism/bigotry. Because Balto is a half-breed, he is treated as if he's less than or not good enough to hang out with the dogs who are full-blooded pedigrees. However, he's the one who comes to the towns rescue, although some of the townsfolk treated him bad as well. He's a true hero in every sense of the word. Awesome freaking' movie.

    Balto is a spectacular film that is an underrated classic. I first saw Balto when I was young and loved it. The film opens with a grandmother walking with her granddaughter and their dog through Central Park, New York. The grandmother wants to show her granddaughter a memorial. They sit down and she begins to tell the story of Balto. The film then flashes back to 1925 in Nome, Alaska. Their we meet Balto, a wolf dog and his caretaker a Russian snow goose named Boris. They are in a rush to see the finish of a sled race. Their Balto sees Jenna, a husky and her owner a little girl named Rosy. The race is one by Steele, a proud and fierce Siberian husky. Steele, the other dogs and the people of Nome see Balto as an outcast due to his half breed status. Balto sneaks back into the city to see Jenna. They discover that the hospital is filled to a strange size and they listen to a meeting between the head doctor and Rosy's father. Diphtheria has spread to Nome and the hospital has run out of antitoxin. A message is sent through to Anchorage and a train is packed to bear the storm and stop at an outpost where a sled dog team will retrieve the medicine. Steele and his team leave but are lost on their way back. Balto and his friends set out to find the lost team. Jenna gets injured and his friends bring her back to Nome while Balto goes alone. Balto is now on a life journey to bring back the toxin before the Diphtheria becomes fatile. The voices in Balto are well selected. We have Kevin Bacon voicing Balto, Bridget Fonda as Jenna, Bob Hoskins as Boris and Jim Cummings as Steele. Miriam Margoyles is also worthy of recognition for playing the grandmother in the beginning and end of the film. The reason why Balto is so good is how serious it can take itself. Their is good occasional comedy but the film does have a dark story line and accompanies it with some dark images. The main character is great. If I were to pick an animated character who resembles me, one of them would be Balto. The side characters are also good characters. Jim Cummings voices Steele who has pride and he will do whatever he can to defend it. He is more of a jerk then a villain and I appreciate the movie for this. The film is also well directed by the underrated Simon Wells who went on to make another classic, The Prince of Egypt. The scenery is brilliant for the film and it still takes my breath away. The ending is just amazing. If people decide to watch Balto, they need to listen to the song at the end "Reach for the Light" sung by Steve Winewood. It gives me goosebumps every time that I hear it. One other comment I should make about Balto is that the film does take itself quite seriously. I don't want to give away some of these themes but you will be surprised by this film especially if you look at the other animated movies that came out before it. Don't get me wrong there are some light hearted comedic moments but the film does keep its intensity and atmosphere. The film's strength lies in its atmosphere and the character of Balto. So many animated movies at this time try to focus on side characters but fail to develop the main character. This film does this very well. I will continue to watch this film via DVD that I recently purchased. The story that you see is true. Of course, some things have been changed but the bravery of the sled dogs led by Balto saved countless lives and the film honours them well. This is among my favourite movies of all time and that will not change. If you like 2D animated films, Balto is one of the best.

    It's rare that one finds an animated movie that has so much heart that isn't connected to Disney. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any others that stand out than this movie. Balto (1995), was loosely based off the real life events of an actual husky dog of the same name. The only difference is that the story was changed slightly to give the character of Balto a little more background. That is why it's loosely based off the actual events. Kudos to the four writers because it made this movie very enjoyable. Here, Balto lives on the edge of a town because he's not a husky. Yet somehow, everyone in the town, including the humans know his name? How is this possible (this is really the only thing I didn't understand)? His ancestry comes from dog/wolf, which leaves him in a bad spot because no one wants to trust him and the snooty pure bread husky dogs don't want a mutt joining their dog team. What Balto dreams most of, is running with the husky dogs and pulling the sleds they pull. And little does he know, but his chance will come sooner than he thinks, when a virus breakout comes on the town and he decides to fetch the medicine for the sick. The cast in this film is horrendously good too. Kevin Bacon voices our hero, Balto. Bacon is able to make his role really sound courageous and emotional when it needs to be and that's good. Voicing his love interest is Bridget Fonda as a little girl's husky named Jenna. Even if this is Fonda's first time doing voice acting, she did a great job. She knows how to give Jenna the right tone of voice and emotion at the same time. And I got to admit, Jenna and Balto make an adorable dog couple. Thank you animation department! Let's also not forget our antagonist named Steele voiced by famous voice actor, Jim Cummings. Cummings, who can do this work in his sleep, also gives a convincing performance as the thickheaded, husky with way too much hubris. And along with Steele are always the knuckle head followers of the antagonist. All of which have their own quirkiness about them, which make them funny. But that's not all. Accompanying Balto on his travels are three other friends. Two are a duo of polar bears named Muk and Luk, which are both voiced by musician Phil Collins. Surprisingly, even Collins gives a memorable performance. But the character I found the most entertaining when it came to comic relief was Boris the goose (the other friend) played by Bob Hoskins. Boris is such a great character because of how well he knows Balto and the problems that he faces. It is because of that, that he does his best to make sure his closest friend is in good hands. If you don't fall for Boris, I don't know what will. The art department did a nice job at keeping the view big and broad. Since the setting was in Alaska, it is only respective that the picture be epic looking. Mainly because, Alaska is epic period. Also I like the sounds a lot. Cracking ice to crunching snow. The one sound that I got chills from was hearing the wolves howl. I couldn't stop from getting goosebumps. I have no clue why but it gave me the shivers and that made me like it more. Adding to that was the soundtrack provided by composer James Horner and boy did it work. Excluding a few previous works that Horner has made that were mishaps, Horner really knows how to evoke the right emotions at the right time. It made watching Balto fun and invigorating. The characters alone is what makes the cake in this movie. The icing to the cake is James Horner's music, the grand backgrounds and involving sound effects.

    This movie's rating on IMDb is far too low. I didn't know this movie was so underrated. When it comes to animated movies, Disney is at the top of the food chain and Pixar comes in at a close second. So it's amazing that this non-Disney, animated film surpasses even some Disney movies -- I don't count the movies like High School Musical. Current Disney is trash aside from some good work like Tangled and Princess And The Frog. - -. -- This is the section where there are possible spoilers. Read at your own risk -- The story is told by Rosy, all grown up and with a granddaughter. From there the animation takes over. Balto, whose mother was a wolf and father a dog, was an outcast among not only dogs but also humans. Due to his half wolf heritage he was thought to be wild with the humans, and most of the dogs thought he was beneath them for being only half dog and a stray. Enter Jenna. Kind and caring to all, even to Steele even though he didn't deserve it. She gave him hope that acceptance wasn't as scarce and limited to two polar bears and a goose. However, his luck changes for the better-- giving him a chance to prove himself to not only the dogs but to the humans as well. The town is hit by an epidemic of diphtheria. And, due to the snow, the medicine is delayed on all modern forms of transportation. The town has little option left and decides to send in the best sledding team to retrieve it from the last layover. Balto was not picked, obviously, but after the team leaves he sets off to find them because a huge snow storm is approaching. -- End of possible spoilers -- I won't go any further, or I'd risk truly spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet but is looking it up on IMDb to see if it's worth watching. This movie will always have a special place in my heart. The story has all the elements it needs. Drama, conflict, romance, etc. The cast selected to VA was amazingly picked. Kevin Bacon did a wonderful job, as did Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins, Jim Cummings an Phil Collins. And the score was excellent. James Horner is a master composer, his work with Titanic is one of his most popular works, it's a shame that this one isn't for it is on equal ground... at least in my opinion. There you have it. Great animation, a interesting and eye catching plot, an amazing cast and musical score. Few films, real live action or animated/CGI, can pull off all of them. Balto did. So if you've never seen it, I recommend you do so and don't judge it until you've watched everything start to finish. I'll always have a fondness for it, I hope after seeing it you will too. My rating: 10 Stars out of 10 Stars.

    I recently found Balto and watched it as it was a film I never watched the whole way through when I was younger and when I found out about it recently and then bought the DVD I have fallen in love with it. The animation and storyline is good and I love the majority of the characters, bar Dixie, Muk and Luk. If those three weren't in it, it would be a lot greater film in my opinion but it is still a good watch. Due to being overshadowed by Toy Story this film never really took off and is not so well known but it really should be because it is a great kids film with great characters and animation and a storyline that, as well as being true, is exciting and makes this film very watchable. 8/10 :)

    I was only one year old when Balto got released in theaters, but I didn't even hear about its existence until recently. I love animation, I love dogs and I felt sorry to hear that this film wasn't very popular when it was released, so I decided to watch it on DVD. What I got was an amazing, inspiring and heart warming animated film which turned out to be one of the best I've ever seen. I was surprised about how much I was connected to the main character Balto. Because he is portrayed as a husky-wolf hybrid, the people of Nome fear of him for being part-wolf, the wolf packs reject him for being part-husky and the other dogs make fun of him for it. As a result, he is an outcast who doesn't know where he belongs, and only relying on Boris, a goose who is afraid of heights to take care of him. I showed a lot of sympathy towards Balto because I've been in similar situations and seeing him being left out was very emotive. The story is loosely based on the true 1925 serum run in Alaska. A disease spreads onto the children of Nome and a snow storm cuts all transport from delivering medicine, so a team sled dogs are sent to pick it up. But poor Balto isn't allowed to help out because of his wolf heritage. When the team is reported missing, Balto sets off on a daring quest to rescue them and get them home safely. This shows how courageous and determined he is to get the medicine to the sick children. That said, he is a very caring character and thats another reason why I really liked him. There's a bit of peril and emotional moments in this film, but plenty of comic relief is present to ease them, mostly involving Boris and Muk and Luk (the two polar bears). I personally liked the recurring gag when Kaltag hits Star in the head for saying something random. It gave me a smile each time. And the romantic moments of Balto and his girlfriend Jenna are extremely sweet indeed. Again, I found it sympathetic when Steele (the films ruthless antagonist) tries to spoil things for Balto by bullying him and trying to take Jenna from him. I found the animation to be very well done. With nice character designs and detailed Alaskan backdrops, all of which are well-drawn and gently animated, it allows to show how much work and effort Amblimation put into this traditionally animated masterpiece. James Horner's music is very atmospheric and dramatic and I liked how there were no random musical numbers to interrupt its flow. The voice acting is just as great. Bob Hoskins (as Boris) and Bridget Fonda (as Jenna) do a good job while Phil Collins voices Muk and Luk adorably and Jim Cummings is great as evil Steele. However, I would have to commend Kevin Bacon's performance for Balto. He voiced Balto sensibly. Not overacting, bland or hip, but he gave the character a more of a calm, humble, shy and likable personality similar to mine. Its another similarity me and Balto have. In conclusion, I would have to say that I absolutely adored Balto, and thats because of its great animation, story, casting and a protagonist who I could really relate to. I'm glad that I found out about this underrated classic and its a good thing others have too. If you like animation or dogs and you haven't seen it already, then I believe that Balto well deserves your attention. You will fall in love with it just like I did. Grade: "A"

    Balto (animated film) seems to be well liked by many. However many people do not know about the real life dog who helped save many children stricken with diphtheria. In the movie Balto looks nothing like the real life Balto did. The real Balto was a Siberian Husky and had no wolf in him. Balto's character always seems unsure of himself. Truly a shame seeing as the real Balto was a lot tougher. This Balto however only musters up enough courage to go and find the lost sled dog team that is carrying the vaccines to the sick only after learning that one of the stricken is Jenna's owner Rosy. Balto doesn't really care about the children, instead he seems more worried about Jenna whom he has affections for and goes to find the lost team only after this fact. Once Balto finds the team, gets rid of the antagonist of the film Steele and leads them back to save the sick. He is finally welcomed by the locals who once treated him as an outcast because of his wolf like traits, but since he is now the hero waiting in the wing everybody seems okay with it now that he's back with the medicine to save the children. Balto doesn't seem too ecstatic about this welcoming home party and instead would rather receive some attention from Jenna. The only thing I really loved about Balto was the villain Steele. Wonderfully voiced by Jim Cummings and perhaps the best developed character of the film. Other characters came off rather weak and could have used more in story development. Balto more than likely will be a bigger hit with young children and people who grew up on the film. However it may be more of a hit and miss with adults. Balto is not a bad film but it isn't great either. 4 out of 10

She knows how to give Jenna the right tone of voice and emotion at the same time. And I got to admit, Jenna and Balto make an adorable dog couple. Thank you animation department! Let's also not forget our antagonist named Steele voiced by famous voice actor, Jim Cummings. Cummings, who can do this work in his sleep, also gives a convincing performance as the thickheaded, husky with way too much hubris. And along with Steele are always the knuckle head followers of the antagonist. All of which have their own quirkiness about them, which make them funny. But that's not all. Accompanying Balto on his travels are three other friends. Two are a duo of polar bears named Muk and Luk, which are both voiced by musician Phil Collins. Surprisingly, even Collins gives a memorable performance. But the character I found the most entertaining when it came to comic relief was Boris the goose (the other friend) played by Bob Hoskins. Boris is such a great character because of how well he knows Balto and the problems that he faces. It is because of that, that he does his best to make sure his closest friend is in good hands. If you don't fall for Boris, I don't know what will. The art department did a nice job at keeping the view big and broad. Since the setting was in Alaska, it is only respective that the picture be epic looking. Mainly because, Alaska is epic period. Also I like the sounds a lot. Cracking ice to crunching snow. The one sound that I got chills from was hearing the wolves howl. I couldn't stop from getting goosebumps. I have no clue why but it gave me the shivers and that made me like it more. Adding to that was the soundtrack provided by composer James Horner and boy did it work. Excluding a few previous works that Horner has made that were mishaps, Horner really knows how to evoke the right emotions at the right time. It made watching Balto fun and invigorating. The characters alone is what makes the cake in this movie. The icing to the cake is James Horner's music, the grand backgrounds and involving sound effects.

    This movie's rating on IMDb is far too low. I didn't know this movie was so underrated. When it comes to animated movies, Disney is at the top of the food chain and Pixar comes in at a close second. So it's amazing that this non-Disney, animated film surpasses even some Disney movies -- I don't count the movies like High School Musical. Current Disney is trash aside from some good work like Tangled and Princess And The Frog. - -. -- This is the section where there are possible spoilers. Read at your own risk -- The story is told by Rosy, all grown up and with a granddaughter. From there the animation takes over. Balto, whose mother was a wolf and father a dog, was an outcast among not only dogs but also humans. Due to his half wolf heritage he was thought to be wild with the humans, and most of the dogs thought he was beneath them for being only half dog and a stray. Enter Jenna. Kind and caring to all, even to Steele even though he didn't deserve it. She gave him hope that acceptance wasn't as scarce and limited to two polar bears and a goose. However, his luck changes for the better-- giving him a chance to prove himself to not only the dogs but to the humans as well. The town is hit by an epidemic of diphtheria. And, due to the snow, the medicine is delayed on all modern forms of transportation. The town has little option left and decides to send in the best sledding team to retrieve it from the last layover. Balto was not picked, obviously, but after the team leaves he sets off to find them because a huge snow storm is approaching. -- End of possible spoilers -- I won't go any further, or I'd risk truly spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet but is looking it up on IMDb to see if it's worth watching. This movie will always have a special place in my heart. The story has all the elements it needs. Drama, conflict, romance, etc. The cast selected to VA was amazingly picked. Kevin Bacon did a wonderful job, as did Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins, Jim Cummings an Phil Collins. And the score was excellent. James Horner is a master composer, his work with Titanic is one of his most popular works, it's a shame that this one isn't for it is on equal ground... at least in my opinion. There you have it. Great animation, a interesting and eye catching plot, an amazing cast and musical score. Few films, real live action or animated/CGI, can pull off all of them. Balto did. So if you've never seen it, I recommend you do so and don't judge it until you've watched everything start to finish. I'll always have a fondness for it, I hope after seeing it you will too. My rating: 10 Stars out of 10 Stars.

    I recently found Balto and watched it as it was a film I never watched the whole way through when I was younger and when I found out about it recently and then bought the DVD I have fallen in love with it. The animation and storyline is good and I love the majority of the characters, bar Dixie, Muk and Luk. If those three weren't in it, it would be a lot greater film in my opinion but it is still a good watch. Due to being overshadowed by Toy Story this film never really took off and is not so well known but it really should be because it is a great kids film with great characters and animation and a storyline that, as well as being true, is exciting and makes this film very watchable. 8/10 :)

    I was only one year old when Balto got released in theaters, but I didn't even hear about its existence until recently. I love animation, I love dogs and I felt sorry to hear that this film wasn't very popular when it was released, so I decided to watch it on DVD. What I got was an amazing, inspiring and heart warming animated film which turned out to be one of the best I've ever seen. I was surprised about how much I was connected to the main character Balto. Because he is portrayed as a husky-wolf hybrid, the people of Nome fear of him for being part-wolf, the wolf packs reject him for being part-husky and the other dogs make fun of him for it. As a result, he is an outcast who doesn't know where he belongs, and only relying on Boris, a goose who is afraid of heights to take care of him. I showed a lot of sympathy towards Balto because I've been in similar situations and seeing him being left out was very emotive. The story is loosely based on the true 1925 serum run in Alaska. A disease spreads onto the children of Nome and a snow storm cuts all transport from delivering medicine, so a team sled dogs are sent to pick it up. But poor Balto isn't allowed to help out because of his wolf heritage. When the team is reported missing, Balto sets off on a daring quest to rescue them and get them home safely. This shows how courageous and determined he is to get the medicine to the sick children. That said, he is a very caring character and thats another reason why I really liked him. There's a bit of peril and emotional moments in this film, but plenty of comic relief is present to ease them, mostly involving Boris and Muk and Luk (the two polar bears). I personally liked the recurring gag when Kaltag hits Star in the head for saying something random. It gave me a smile each time. And the romantic moments of Balto and his girlfriend Jenna are extremely sweet indeed. Again, I found it sympathetic when Steele (the films ruthless antagonist) tries to spoil things for Balto by bullying him and trying to take Jenna from him. I found the animation to be very well done. With nice character designs and detailed Alaskan backdrops, all of which are well-drawn and gently animated, it allows to show how much work and effort Amblimation put into this traditionally animated masterpiece. James Horner's music is very atmospheric and dramatic and I liked how there were no random musical numbers to interrupt its flow. The voice acting is just as great. Bob Hoskins (as Boris) and Bridget Fonda (as Jenna) do a good job while Phil Collins voices Muk and Luk adorably and Jim Cummings is great as evil Steele. However, I would have to commend Kevin Bacon's performance for Balto. He voiced Balto sensibly. Not overacting, bland or hip, but he gave the character a more of a calm, humble, shy and likable personality similar to mine. Its another similarity me and Balto have. In conclusion, I would have to say that I absolutely adored Balto, and thats because of its great animation, story, casting and a protagonist who I could really relate to. I'm glad that I found out about this underrated classic and its a good thing others have too. If you like animation or dogs and you haven't seen it already, then I believe that Balto well deserves your attention. You will fall in love with it just like I did. Grade: "A"

    Balto (animated film) seems to be well liked by many. However many people do not know about the real life dog who helped save many children stricken with diphtheria. In the movie Balto looks nothing like the real life Balto did. The real Balto was a Siberian Husky and had no wolf in him. Balto's character always seems unsure of himself. Truly a shame seeing as the real Balto was a lot tougher. This Balto however only musters up enough courage to go and find the lost sled dog team that is carrying the vaccines to the sick only after learning that one of the stricken is Jenna's owner Rosy. Balto doesn't really care about the children, instead he seems more worried about Jenna whom he has affections for and goes to find the lost team only after this fact. Once Balto finds the team, gets rid of the antagonist of the film Steele and leads them back to save the sick. He is finally welcomed by the locals who once treated him as an outcast because of his wolf like traits, but since he is now the hero waiting in the wing everybody seems okay with it now that he's back with the medicine to save the children. Balto doesn't seem too ecstatic about this welcoming home party and instead would rather receive some attention from Jenna. The only thing I really loved about Balto was the villain Steele. Wonderfully voiced by Jim Cummings and perhaps the best developed character of the film. Other characters came off rather weak and could have used more in story development. Balto more than likely will be a bigger hit with young children and people who grew up on the film. However it may be more of a hit and miss with adults. Balto is not a bad film but it isn't great either. 4 out of 10

    Well I have watched Balto and its sequels when I was young. I think that the first one is best Balto movie. its just an amazing movie based on a true story about a wolf that saved some very sick child. its no where near as good as Coraline or Babe but its amazing movie to watch. The story is about Balto a wolf and haft dog who is a stray dog to people and gets bullied a lot by a dog called Steele but when Steele and the gang got lost in the snow Balto came to help them But Steele did not needed help but Balto took the gang threw the snow and made it back in one piece and he became a hero to people. the movie is just great who has not seen this movie before should watch because its amazing movie so if love dog films like Marley and me or All dogs go to heaven then this is a movie you should watch because its amazing I give this movie 8.3 out of 10 very good.

    I think it's obvious to see why Balto was ignored during it's theater release, coming out not to long after Toy Story (which is a better film). But I'm glad to see that it's popularity has grown in the 16 years since it's release. Balto is a half wolf, half dog that is basically an outcast in his town of Nome Alaska. When the children of the town develop a fatal disease, a sled team must go and receive medacine. Unfortunattly the team get's lost and now Balto must go find them and help them get the medicine back to Nome. I'm not going to lie and say the movie is flawless, the story is nothing new, the characters are kinda bland and the comedy reliefs are a little more annoying than funny, thankfully they don't follow Balto throughout his journey. With nice animation, a good cast, and a solid story, Balto is worth picking up.

    The way Balto is wrote, the way its animations were made, the way the story and it's main character plays and roles, makes Balto one heck of a touching movie. I know we are in 2011, but i only got to see this fantastic movie today (it wasn't released in my country, but i got the VHS from a friend). And it was 1 hour well spent! Kinda makes us think what an animal can do for us, even if we can't really talk to them! Even if a lot of people thinks that this kind of story is old, or too used, this movie is still awesome. I can put it side by side with Disney's greatest creations! I even thought the movie was made by Disney! Just like a bunch of people said back there, you MUST see it, only a person with no heart will not like this movie!

    How anyone could give this film anything but a 10 is beyond me. The animation is awesome. The plot, story and characters are fantastic and to top it off, this film is based on a true story. Balto actually existed. He was a hero and has his very own statue. I think the majority of kids, especially those who love animals will absolutely love this movie as well. The underlying message of this movie highlights the effects of racism/bigotry. Because Balto is a half-breed, he is treated as if he's less than or not good enough to hang out with the dogs who are full-blooded pedigrees. However, he's the one who comes to the towns rescue, although some of the townsfolk treated him bad as well. He's a true hero in every sense of the word. Awesome freaking' movie.
