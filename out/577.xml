    Aliens Beldar and Prymatt, with cone-shaped heads from the planet Remulak are mistakingly grounded on earth, during a scouting mission for planet conquest. While here, they dodge the INS, have a child and discover that life on Earth is quite good. But unfortunately they are being chased by the government who know something is not quite right with the Conehead family. After they are rescued and taken back to their planet, Belder is told to come back and destroy planet Earth.... This was straight to video here in the UK, and it's pretty clear as to why this happened. After the success of Waynes World, every SNL sketch thought it would have a crack at the movies, and while WW had a good narrative and background story, this is unoriginal stuff, and just an excuse for sight gags. Ackroyd is particularly bad in this, and I may be missing the whole point of the film, but only one person points out the abnormality. Maybe because the majority of folk in the USA are alien, or maybe because the writers just could not be bothered. Aside from cameos from lots of other below par comedians, Coneheads has nothing to offer, other than desperation from Ackroyd, who at one time was a comedic force to be reckoned with in Hollywood.

    I've never watched a microsecond of SNL so I watched this as just another film. It's not Gone with the Wind, but it doesn't pretend to be. It's a small scale comedy. It isn't 90 minutes of side splitting belly laughs, but it's mildly amusing throughout and there are a number of pretty good jokes. Flicking through the twenty or so movies my cable channel is offering me this evening, I'd prefer Coneheads to any of them. That doesn't make it a masterpiece, it just makes it a solid little comedy that will leave you more cheerful at the end than you were at the beginning. For those who like their comedy to be cutting edge with constant sarcastic political barbs, you should look elsewhere. (Is this why some reviewers don't like it - maybe they were expecting political satire ?) This isn't satire, it's mild smiley humour a la Ghostbusters, and none the worse for that.

    Aliens with cone shaped craniums (including Dan Aykroyd) come to Earth to observe everyday life. I am not sure which Saturday Night Live sketch was the first to be transformed into a movie, but at some point it became more and more common, and in the 1990s it seemed they could turn just about anything into a film. Some were hugely successful ("Wayne's World") while others have been largely forgotten ("It's Pat" and "Stuart Saves His Family" come to mind). I suppose "Coneheads" falls somewhere in the middle. By no means was it a flop, but I feel like it never really had a strong popularity. The best thing that came out of it was probably the soundtrack. But, perhaps wisely, the film is also not very ambitious and instead just wants to show a young woman coming of age and trying to be accepted by her peers. Not a bad little theme.

    This really is a hidden gem of a film. I can see how todays generation and their obsession with edgy humor, abrasive language,shock laughs, and depravity, couldn't appreciate this underrated comedy classic. It's clever, creative, well written, and Dan Akroyd is downright hilarious. How can you not burst out laughing when he tells Ronnie (Chris Farley)"I find you unacceptable. If I did not fear incarceration by human authority figures, I would terminate your life functions by applying sufficient force to your blunt skull  as to cause its collapse." The cameos from Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, David Spaid,Drew Carey, Jon Lovitz, Sinbad, and Jason Alexander all made for hilarious moments. It even managed to add some subtle social commentary without being preachy at all. Get your funny bones checked guys, this is a classic SNL film from when SNL was great.

    I recently saw "Coneheads" on TV, and, though is silly, sometimes has pleasant gags and funny moments. It's the story about a family of aliens who come to the Earth to reconnaissance it, and soon they are adapted to the life of America and its customs. But Mr. and Mrs. Conehead still yearn their native planet, though they had done a new life on Earth. As I said, this movie has great moments, but gets flat on the stretch. Not the best work of Dan Akyroyd, but it's still enjoyable. A funny quote: Beldar Conehead: An owner's manual to a Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable. Highmaster: Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable? Beldar Conehead: A personal conveyance named after its inventor, an assassinated ruler, a character from Greco-Roman myth and a small furry mammal. Highmaster: Ah.

    "Coneheads" is yet another film based on a recurring Saturday Night Live sketch. At the time of its release, it was the third SNL-based movie created following "The Blues Brothers" (1980) and "Wayne's World" (1992). While not as funny as the aforementioned films, it is only a notch below them. Worse SNL movies were to come (i.e. "It's Pat: The Movie" (1994), "A Night At The Roxbury" (1999)), but "Coneheads" stands today as a very funny mix of comedy and science fiction. The early Saturday Night Live sketches vaguely explained how the Coneheads came to Earth. Most of its humor came from the fact that the humans, or "blunt skulls", never suspected the Coneheads to be aliens from another planet, despite the oh-so obviously large foreheads. The fact that their last names are "Conehead" never seems to counter Earthlings' obliviousness, either. This movie takes some of its humor from the humans' obvious lack of observational skills, but it's really Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtan's consistent disappearance into these character that really makes the movie funny. They talk in monotone voices and spew out complicated alien jargon without missing a beat, and they use the film's special effects to their advantage. I also liked how, because the last Coneheads sketch was 14 years prior to this movie's release, the movie started from the beginning, explaining how Beldar (Aykroyd) and Prymatt (Curtan) landed on Earth in modern-day America, and worked their way from a hotel room to the projects to the suburbs. While I missed Laraine Newman as Connie (although Newman does make an appearance as Laarta, another Conehead in a later scene), it made perfect sense to have a younger, teenage Connie (Michelle Burke) with an American accent. Although the subplot where she begins dating 29-year-old mechanic Ronnie (Chris Farley) still seems creepy to me, considering her character was supposed to be 15 or 16, I thought Burke added a really nice touch to what could have been a Dan Aykroyd impersonation. The main conflict of the film served as an interesting analogy to illegal immigration, but had some definite plot holes. You find out in the film that Beldar and Prymatt land on Earth accidentally, and stay not because they want to, but because a rescue ship will take seven Zerl's to reach them. According to a site I found using Google (www.tvacres.com/languages_scifi_conehead.htm), one Zerl is equal to approximately 2.17 Earth years, thereby making their stay just over 15 years. Based on that fact, a giant plot hole emerges when INS agents and antagonists Gorman Seedling (Michael McKean) and Eli Turnbull (David Spade) don't age at all over that time period. Also, near the end, the rescue ship finally comes for the Coneheads, and it seems to take about a day to travel back to Remulak, their native planet. Although I thought the home planet in this movie was among the coolest parts, I still could not get over that plot hole. Why it took over a decade and a half to bring a ship over, yet it didn't take that long to go from Earth to Remulak and back, is never explained, and weakens the story a bit. However, other parts in the film otherwise made me laugh. The best parts were when the Coneheads interacted with humans in the outside world. Also, perhaps better than any other SNL movie to date, having numerous former and (then) current Not Ready For Primetime Players in various roles large and small served as a great tribute to "Saturday Night Live". There were also a few cameos from then-unknown stand-up comedians who would go on to be big stars (Ellen DeGeneres, Drew Carey, Eddie Griffin). "The Blues Brothers", "Wayne's World", and "Wayne's World 2" (1993) were hard movies to top, but "Coneheads", while not great, is pretty funny, and miles away from the notoriously bad SNL movies that were to come. It suffered mostly from its story line, but otherwise used special effects wisely to effectively elicit laughs. It's a good movie to watch after you have consumed mass quantities and want to get a good laugh while you digest.

    There's absolutely nothing - not a single thing - in this movie that can be taken seriously, which is probably why it's so enjoyable for the most part to watch. Based on a skit from Saturday Night Live (when SNL was really in its heyday) this is a fun look at the lives of the Coneheads - Beldar and Prymatt and their daughter Connie, a family of pointy headed aliens who get stuck on earth and have to blend in among the "bluntskulls," claiming to be from France (which no one ever questions) and enjoying such earth delicacies as "charred mammal flesh" and "flattened chicken embryos." Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin (as Beldar and Prymatt) demonstrate remarkable talent just in being able to get through this with relatively straight faces. Michelle Burke as the Conehead daughter Connie had a less demanding role - Connie having been born on earth had fewer adjustment issues to deal with. The part of the story dealing with the Coneheads being pursued by a couple of over-enthusiastic immigration agents (played by David Spade and Michael McKean) was perhaps an unnecessary addition to the story, and somehow the story seemed to lose its footing a bit once the Coneheads returned to their home planet of Remulak. In what was so obviously intended to be a silly movie, much of the Remulak storyline came across as too silly. Simply watching the Coneheads attempting to blend in to human society would have been sufficiently enjoyable. The movie has a surprisingly low rating here, suggesting to me that many people are perhaps treating it too seriously. It's a silly movie that's clearly intending to be a silly movie. To over-analyze it and look for weaknesses is to do it an injustice. Accept it for what it is and it will provide an overall very enjoyable 90 minutes.

    It isn't serious at all. What the writers, actors, and director did was take a repeating skit on SNL and expand it. In the process they made these rather odd alien characters familiar, flawed (and therefore human), and endearing. This is no small feat. They are odd in the extreme eating toilet paper, light bulbs, and talking in jargon laced monotone. But in doing that they also made life on earth and the simple pleasures we all enjoy, something to be appreciated...from an outsider's point of view. I think another thing that makes the movie a joy to watch is the high production values. It's a comedy about a richly detailed alien culture with first-rate sets, interesting devices, crazy and funny characters (most of the humans are deeply flawed) and some of the best stop-motion animation ever filmed. The Nafle the Garthog scene would have deeply impressed Ray Harryhausen. Continuity was high, the acting quite good (comedy is said to be the hardest thing to do), sets and scenery nicely done and the story itself with a nice easy to follow story arc and a (gasp) happy ending. What else would anyone want in the way of light entertainment?

    This one is such a classic. I don't know why so many people hate it. I found it very funny all the way through. What surprised me when viewing it after haven't seeing it for over 10 years is that most of the SNL cast is in this movie. I found them to be pretty funny. *Spoiler Alert* The movie revolves around a couple of aliens who get left on Earth and they can't leave Earth for a long period of time so the alien couple try to adapt on Earth by starting a family and living among the people of Earth. The movie is called Coneheads because of the top of their head is shaped like a cone. *End Spoiler* The movie is very funny. I would recommend everybody see this. I was pleasantly surprised to find it just as funny as I did 10 years ago. Don't worry, Dan Aykroyd and the rest of the SNL cast won't disappoint you. Pick it up for some good laughs.

    I could say, you had to be there. Or you just aren't old enough to understand. The bottom line? Sometimes it is nice to just sit back, suspend your disbelief and enjoy without having to analyze why it works or doesn't work. This falls back to a time when crude and rude was still in its infancy. Light for the day, it is still lots of fun. The punch lines are subtle and innuendo a bit advance for the punch and Judy crowd that is looking for the "Down with society" commentary that seems to fill the comedy of today. The Coneheads are classic Old School SNL. I like a story where the good guy wins, albeit the good guys in this case are Aliens. If you like Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis, or Danny Kay. Then you will probably like this movie. If you are the Dumb and Dumber crowd this will probably be a disappointment. So, suspend your disbeliefe and just enjoy it for what it is. A funny movie with a lot of "good" laughs.

    It isn't serious at all. What the writers, actors, and director did was take a repeating skit on SNL and expand it. In the process they made these rather odd alien characters familiar, flawed (and therefore human), and endearing. This is no small feat. They are odd in the extreme eating toilet paper, light bulbs, and talking in jargon laced monotone. But in doing that they also made life on earth and the simple pleasures we all enjoy, something to be appreciated...from an outsider's point of view. I think another thing that makes the movie a joy to watch is the high production values. It's a comedy about a richly detailed alien culture with first-rate sets, interesting devices, crazy and funny characters (most of the humans are deeply flawed) and some of the best stop-motion animation ever filmed. The Nafle the Garthog scene would have deeply impressed Ray Harryhausen. Continuity was high, the acting quite good (comedy is said to be the hardest thing to do), sets and scenery nicely done and the story itself with a nice easy to follow story arc and a (gasp) happy ending. What else would anyone want in the way of light entertainment?

    This one is such a classic. I don't know why so many people hate it. I found it very funny all the way through. What surprised me when viewing it after haven't seeing it for over 10 years is that most of the SNL cast is in this movie. I found them to be pretty funny. *Spoiler Alert* The movie revolves around a couple of aliens who get left on Earth and they can't leave Earth for a long period of time so the alien couple try to adapt on Earth by starting a family and living among the people of Earth. The movie is called Coneheads because of the top of their head is shaped like a cone. *End Spoiler* The movie is very funny. I would recommend everybody see this. I was pleasantly surprised to find it just as funny as I did 10 years ago. Don't worry, Dan Aykroyd and the rest of the SNL cast won't disappoint you. Pick it up for some good laughs.

    I could say, you had to be there. Or you just aren't old enough to understand. The bottom line? Sometimes it is nice to just sit back, suspend your disbelief and enjoy without having to analyze why it works or doesn't work. This falls back to a time when crude and rude was still in its infancy. Light for the day, it is still lots of fun. The punch lines are subtle and innuendo a bit advance for the punch and Judy crowd that is looking for the "Down with society" commentary that seems to fill the comedy of today. The Coneheads are classic Old School SNL. I like a story where the good guy wins, albeit the good guys in this case are Aliens. If you like Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis, or Danny Kay. Then you will probably like this movie. If you are the Dumb and Dumber crowd this will probably be a disappointment. So, suspend your disbeliefe and just enjoy it for what it is. A funny movie with a lot of "good" laughs.

    Aliens Beldar and Prymatt, with cone-shaped heads from the planet Remulak are mistakingly grounded on earth, during a scouting mission for planet conquest. While here, they dodge the INS, have a child and discover that life on Earth is quite good. But unfortunately they are being chased by the government who know something is not quite right with the Conehead family. After they are rescued and taken back to their planet, Belder is told to come back and destroy planet Earth.... This was straight to video here in the UK, and it's pretty clear as to why this happened. After the success of Waynes World, every SNL sketch thought it would have a crack at the movies, and while WW had a good narrative and background story, this is unoriginal stuff, and just an excuse for sight gags. Ackroyd is particularly bad in this, and I may be missing the whole point of the film, but only one person points out the abnormality. Maybe because the majority of folk in the USA are alien, or maybe because the writers just could not be bothered. Aside from cameos from lots of other below par comedians, Coneheads has nothing to offer, other than desperation from Ackroyd, who at one time was a comedic force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. Ghostbusters seems but a memory after seeing this trash

    I've never watched a microsecond of SNL so I watched this as just another film. It's not Gone with the Wind, but it doesn't pretend to be. It's a small scale comedy. It isn't 90 minutes of side splitting belly laughs, but it's mildly amusing throughout and there are a number of pretty good jokes. Flicking through the twenty or so movies my cable channel is offering me this evening, I'd prefer Coneheads to any of them. That doesn't make it a masterpiece, it just makes it a solid little comedy that will leave you more cheerful at the end than you were at the beginning. For those who like their comedy to be cutting edge with constant sarcastic political barbs, you should look elsewhere. (Is this why some reviewers don't like it - maybe they were expecting political satire ?) This isn't satire, it's mild smiley humour a la Ghostbusters, and none the worse for that.

    Aliens with cone shaped craniums (including Dan Aykroyd) come to Earth to observe everyday life. I am not sure which Saturday Night Live sketch was the first to be transformed into a movie, but at some point it became more and more common, and in the 1990s it seemed they could turn just about anything into a film. Some were hugely successful ("Wayne's World") while others have been largely forgotten ("It's Pat" and "Stuart Saves His Family" come to mind). I suppose "Coneheads" falls somewhere in the middle. By no means was it a flop, but I feel like it never really had a strong popularity. The best thing that came out of it was probably the soundtrack. But, perhaps wisely, the film is also not very ambitious and instead just wants to show a young woman coming of age and trying to be accepted by her peers. Not a bad little theme.

    This really is a hidden gem of a film. I can see how todays generation and their obsession with edgy humor, abrasive language,shock laughs, and depravity, couldn't appreciate this underrated comedy classic. It's clever, creative, well written, and Dan Akroyd is downright hilarious. How can you not burst out laughing when he tells Ronnie (Chris Farley)"I find you unacceptable. If I did not fear incarceration by human authority figures, I would terminate your life functions by applying sufficient force to your blunt skull  as to cause its collapse." The cameos from Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, David Spaid,Drew Carey, Jon Lovitz, Sinbad, and Jason Alexander all made for hilarious moments. It even managed to add some subtle social commentary without being preachy at all. Get your funny bones checked guys, this is a classic SNL film from when SNL was great.

    I recently saw "Coneheads" on TV, and, though is silly, sometimes has pleasant gags and funny moments. It's the story about a family of aliens who come to the Earth to reconnaissance it, and soon they are adapted to the life of America and its customs. But Mr. and Mrs. Conehead still yearn their native planet, though they had done a new life on Earth. As I said, this movie has great moments, but gets flat on the stretch. Not the best work of Dan Akyroyd, but it's still enjoyable. A funny quote: Beldar Conehead: An owner's manual to a Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable. Highmaster: Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable? Beldar Conehead: A personal conveyance named after its inventor, an assassinated ruler, a character from Greco-Roman myth and a small furry mammal. Highmaster: Ah.

    "Coneheads" is yet another film based on a recurring Saturday Night Live sketch. At the time of its release, it was the third SNL-based movie created following "The Blues Brothers" (1980) and "Wayne's World" (1992). While not as funny as the aforementioned films, it is only a notch below them. Worse SNL movies were to come (i.e. "It's Pat: The Movie" (1994), "A Night At The Roxbury" (1999)), but "Coneheads" stands today as a very funny mix of comedy and science fiction. The early Saturday Night Live sketches vaguely explained how the Coneheads came to Earth. Most of its humor came from the fact that the humans, or "blunt skulls", never suspected the Coneheads to be aliens from another planet, despite the oh-so obviously large foreheads. The fact that their last names are "Conehead" never seems to counter Earthlings' obliviousness, either. This movie takes some of its humor from the humans' obvious lack of observational skills, but it's really Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtan's consistent disappearance into these character that really makes the movie funny. They talk in monotone voices and spew out complicated alien jargon without missing a beat, and they use the film's special effects to their advantage. I also liked how, because the last Coneheads sketch was 14 years prior to this movie's release, the movie started from the beginning, explaining how Beldar (Aykroyd) and Prymatt (Curtan) landed on Earth in modern-day America, and worked their way from a hotel room to the projects to the suburbs. While I missed Laraine Newman as Connie (although Newman does make an appearance as Laarta, another Conehead in a later scene), it made perfect sense to have a younger, teenage Connie (Michelle Burke) with an American accent. Although the subplot where she begins dating 29-year-old mechanic Ronnie (Chris Farley) still seems creepy to me, considering her character was supposed to be 15 or 16, I thought Burke added a really nice touch to what could have been a Dan Aykroyd impersonation. The main conflict of the film served as an interesting analogy to illegal immigration, but had some definite plot holes. You find out in the film that Beldar and Prymatt land on Earth accidentally, and stay not because they want to, but because a rescue ship will take seven Zerl's to reach them. According to a site I found using Google (www.tvacres.com/languages_scifi_conehead.htm), one Zerl is equal to approximately 2.17 Earth years, thereby making their stay just over 15 years. Based on that fact, a giant plot hole emerges when INS agents and antagonists Gorman Seedling (Michael McKean) and Eli Turnbull (David Spade) don't age at all over that time period. Also, near the end, the rescue ship finally comes for the Coneheads, and it seems to take about a day to travel back to Remulak, their native planet. Although I thought the home planet in this movie was among the coolest parts, I still could not get over that plot hole. Why it took over a decade and a half to bring a ship over, yet it didn't take that long to go from Earth to Remulak and back, is never explained, and weakens the story a bit. However, other parts in the film otherwise made me laugh. The best parts were when the Coneheads interacted with humans in the outside world. Also, perhaps better than any other SNL movie to date, having numerous former and (then) current Not Ready For Primetime Players in various roles large and small served as a great tribute to "Saturday Night Live". There were also a few cameos from then-unknown stand-up comedians who would go on to be big stars (Ellen DeGeneres, Drew Carey, Eddie Griffin). "The Blues Brothers", "Wayne's World", and "Wayne's World 2" (1993) were hard movies to top, but "Coneheads", while not great, is pretty funny, and miles away from the notoriously bad SNL movies that were to come. It suffered mostly from its story line, but otherwise used special effects wisely to effectively elicit laughs. It's a good movie to watch after you have consumed mass quantities and want to get a good laugh while you digest.

    There's absolutely nothing - not a single thing - in this movie that can be taken seriously, which is probably why it's so enjoyable for the most part to watch. Based on a skit from Saturday Night Live (when SNL was really in its heyday) this is a fun look at the lives of the Coneheads - Beldar and Prymatt and their daughter Connie, a family of pointy headed aliens who get stuck on earth and have to blend in among the "bluntskulls," claiming to be from France (which no one ever questions) and enjoying such earth delicacies as "charred mammal flesh" and "flattened chicken embryos." Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin (as Beldar and Prymatt) demonstrate remarkable talent just in being able to get through this with relatively straight faces. Michelle Burke as the Conehead daughter Connie had a less demanding role - Connie having been born on earth had fewer adjustment issues to deal with. The part of the story dealing with the Coneheads being pursued by a couple of over-enthusiastic immigration agents (played by David Spade and Michael McKean) was perhaps an unnecessary addition to the story, and somehow the story seemed to lose its footing a bit once the Coneheads returned to their home planet of Remulak. In what was so obviously intended to be a silly movie, much of the Remulak storyline came across as too silly. Simply watching the Coneheads attempting to blend in to human society would have been sufficiently enjoyable. The movie has a surprisingly low rating here, suggesting to me that many people are perhaps treating it too seriously. It's a silly movie that's clearly intending to be a silly movie. To over-analyze it and look for weaknesses is to do it an injustice. Accept it for what it is and it will provide an overall very enjoyable 90 minutes.

    It isn't serious at all. What the writers, actors, and director did was take a repeating skit on SNL and expand it. In the process they made these rather odd alien characters familiar, flawed (and therefore human), and endearing. This is no small feat. They are odd in the extreme eating toilet paper, light bulbs, and talking in jargon laced monotone. But in doing that they also made life on earth and the simple pleasures we all enjoy, something to be appreciated...from an outsider's point of view. I think another thing that makes the movie a joy to watch is the high production values. It's a comedy about a richly detailed alien culture with first-rate sets, interesting devices, crazy and funny characters (most of the humans are deeply flawed) and some of the best stop-motion animation ever filmed. The Nafle the Garthog scene would have deeply impressed Ray Harryhausen. Continuity was high, the acting quite good (comedy is said to be the hardest thing to do), sets and scenery nicely done and the story itself with a nice easy to follow story arc and a (gasp) happy ending. What else would anyone want in the way of light entertainment?

Based on a skit from Saturday Night Live (when SNL was really in its heyday) this is a fun look at the lives of the Coneheads - Beldar and Prymatt and their daughter Connie, a family of pointy headed aliens who get stuck on earth and have to blend in among the "bluntskulls," claiming to be from France (which no one ever questions) and enjoying such earth delicacies as "charred mammal flesh" and "flattened chicken embryos." Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin (as Beldar and Prymatt) demonstrate remarkable talent just in being able to get through this with relatively straight faces. Michelle Burke as the Conehead daughter Connie had a less demanding role - Connie having been born on earth had fewer adjustment issues to deal with. The part of the story dealing with the Coneheads being pursued by a couple of over-enthusiastic immigration agents (played by David Spade and Michael McKean) was perhaps an unnecessary addition to the story, and somehow the story seemed to lose its footing a bit once the Coneheads returned to their home planet of Remulak. In what was so obviously intended to be a silly movie, much of the Remulak storyline came across as too silly. Simply watching the Coneheads attempting to blend in to human society would have been sufficiently enjoyable. The movie has a surprisingly low rating here, suggesting to me that many people are perhaps treating it too seriously. It's a silly movie that's clearly intending to be a silly movie. To over-analyze it and look for weaknesses is to do it an injustice. Accept it for what it is and it will provide an overall very enjoyable 90 minutes.

    It isn't serious at all. What the writers, actors, and director did was take a repeating skit on SNL and expand it. In the process they made these rather odd alien characters familiar, flawed (and therefore human), and endearing. This is no small feat. They are odd in the extreme eating toilet paper, light bulbs, and talking in jargon laced monotone. But in doing that they also made life on earth and the simple pleasures we all enjoy, something to be appreciated...from an outsider's point of view. I think another thing that makes the movie a joy to watch is the high production values. It's a comedy about a richly detailed alien culture with first-rate sets, interesting devices, crazy and funny characters (most of the humans are deeply flawed) and some of the best stop-motion animation ever filmed. The Nafle the Garthog scene would have deeply impressed Ray Harryhausen. Continuity was high, the acting quite good (comedy is said to be the hardest thing to do), sets and scenery nicely done and the story itself with a nice easy to follow story arc and a (gasp) happy ending. What else would anyone want in the way of light entertainment?

    This one is such a classic. I don't know why so many people hate it. I found it very funny all the way through. What surprised me when viewing it after haven't seeing it for over 10 years is that most of the SNL cast is in this movie. I found them to be pretty funny. *Spoiler Alert* The movie revolves around a couple of aliens who get left on Earth and they can't leave Earth for a long period of time so the alien couple try to adapt on Earth by starting a family and living among the people of Earth. The movie is called Coneheads because of the top of their head is shaped like a cone. *End Spoiler* The movie is very funny. I would recommend everybody see this. I was pleasantly surprised to find it just as funny as I did 10 years ago. Don't worry, Dan Aykroyd and the rest of the SNL cast won't disappoint you. Pick it up for some good laughs.

    I could say, you had to be there. Or you just aren't old enough to understand. The bottom line? Sometimes it is nice to just sit back, suspend your disbelief and enjoy without having to analyze why it works or doesn't work. This falls back to a time when crude and rude was still in its infancy. Light for the day, it is still lots of fun. The punch lines are subtle and innuendo a bit advance for the punch and Judy crowd that is looking for the "Down with society" commentary that seems to fill the comedy of today. The Coneheads are classic Old School SNL. I like a story where the good guy wins, albeit the good guys in this case are Aliens. If you like Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis, or Danny Kay. Then you will probably like this movie. If you are the Dumb and Dumber crowd this will probably be a disappointment. So, suspend your disbeliefe and just enjoy it for what it is. A funny movie with a lot of "good" laughs.

    Aliens Beldar and Prymatt, with cone-shaped heads from the planet Remulak are mistakingly grounded on earth, during a scouting mission for planet conquest. While here, they dodge the INS, have a child and discover that life on Earth is quite good. But unfortunately they are being chased by the government who know something is not quite right with the Conehead family. After they are rescued and taken back to their planet, Belder is told to come back and destroy planet Earth.... This was straight to video here in the UK, and it's pretty clear as to why this happened. After the success of Waynes World, every SNL sketch thought it would have a crack at the movies, and while WW had a good narrative and background story, this is unoriginal stuff, and just an excuse for sight gags. Ackroyd is particularly bad in this, and I may be missing the whole point of the film, but only one person points out the abnormality. Maybe because the majority of folk in the USA are alien, or maybe because the writers just could not be bothered. Aside from cameos from lots of other below par comedians, Coneheads has nothing to offer, other than desperation from Ackroyd, who at one time was a comedic force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. Ghostbusters seems but a memory after seeing this trash

    I've never watched a microsecond of SNL so I watched this as just another film. It's not Gone with the Wind, but it doesn't pretend to be. It's a small scale comedy. It isn't 90 minutes of side splitting belly laughs, but it's mildly amusing throughout and there are a number of pretty good jokes. Flicking through the twenty or so movies my cable channel is offering me this evening, I'd prefer Coneheads to any of them. That doesn't make it a masterpiece, it just makes it a solid little comedy that will leave you more cheerful at the end than you were at the beginning. For those who like their comedy to be cutting edge with constant sarcastic political barbs, you should look elsewhere. (Is this why some reviewers don't like it - maybe they were expecting political satire ?) This isn't satire, it's mild smiley humour a la Ghostbusters, and none the worse for that.

    Aliens with cone shaped craniums (including Dan Aykroyd) come to Earth to observe everyday life. I am not sure which Saturday Night Live sketch was the first to be transformed into a movie, but at some point it became more and more common, and in the 1990s it seemed they could turn just about anything into a film. Some were hugely successful ("Wayne's World") while others have been largely forgotten ("It's Pat" and "Stuart Saves His Family" come to mind). I suppose "Coneheads" falls somewhere in the middle. By no means was it a flop, but I feel like it never really had a strong popularity. The best thing that came out of it was probably the soundtrack. But, perhaps wisely, the film is also not very ambitious and instead just wants to show a young woman coming of age and trying to be accepted by her peers. Not a bad little theme.

    This really is a hidden gem of a film. I can see how todays generation and their obsession with edgy humor, abrasive language,shock laughs, and depravity, couldn't appreciate this underrated comedy classic. It's clever, creative, well written, and Dan Akroyd is downright hilarious. How can you not burst out laughing when he tells Ronnie (Chris Farley)"I find you unacceptable. If I did not fear incarceration by human authority figures, I would terminate your life functions by applying sufficient force to your blunt skull  as to cause its collapse." The cameos from Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, David Spaid,Drew Carey, Jon Lovitz, Sinbad, and Jason Alexander all made for hilarious moments. It even managed to add some subtle social commentary without being preachy at all. Get your funny bones checked guys, this is a classic SNL film from when SNL was great.

    I recently saw "Coneheads" on TV, and, though is silly, sometimes has pleasant gags and funny moments. It's the story about a family of aliens who come to the Earth to reconnaissance it, and soon they are adapted to the life of America and its customs. But Mr. and Mrs. Conehead still yearn their native planet, though they had done a new life on Earth. As I said, this movie has great moments, but gets flat on the stretch. Not the best work of Dan Akyroyd, but it's still enjoyable. A funny quote: Beldar Conehead: An owner's manual to a Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable. Highmaster: Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable? Beldar Conehead: A personal conveyance named after its inventor, an assassinated ruler, a character from Greco-Roman myth and a small furry mammal. Highmaster: Ah.

    "Coneheads" is yet another film based on a recurring Saturday Night Live sketch. At the time of its release, it was the third SNL-based movie created following "The Blues Brothers" (1980) and "Wayne's World" (1992). While not as funny as the aforementioned films, it is only a notch below them. Worse SNL movies were to come (i.e. "It's Pat: The Movie" (1994), "A Night At The Roxbury" (1999)), but "Coneheads" stands today as a very funny mix of comedy and science fiction. The early Saturday Night Live sketches vaguely explained how the Coneheads came to Earth. Most of its humor came from the fact that the humans, or "blunt skulls", never suspected the Coneheads to be aliens from another planet, despite the oh-so obviously large foreheads. The fact that their last names are "Conehead" never seems to counter Earthlings' obliviousness, either. This movie takes some of its humor from the humans' obvious lack of observational skills, but it's really Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtan's consistent disappearance into these character that really makes the movie funny. They talk in monotone voices and spew out complicated alien jargon without missing a beat, and they use the film's special effects to their advantage. I also liked how, because the last Coneheads sketch was 14 years prior to this movie's release, the movie started from the beginning, explaining how Beldar (Aykroyd) and Prymatt (Curtan) landed on Earth in modern-day America, and worked their way from a hotel room to the projects to the suburbs. While I missed Laraine Newman as Connie (although Newman does make an appearance as Laarta, another Conehead in a later scene), it made perfect sense to have a younger, teenage Connie (Michelle Burke) with an American accent. Although the subplot where she begins dating 29-year-old mechanic Ronnie (Chris Farley) still seems creepy to me, considering her character was supposed to be 15 or 16, I thought Burke added a really nice touch to what could have been a Dan Aykroyd impersonation. The main conflict of the film served as an interesting analogy to illegal immigration, but had some definite plot holes. You find out in the film that Beldar and Prymatt land on Earth accidentally, and stay not because they want to, but because a rescue ship will take seven Zerl's to reach them. According to a site I found using Google (www.tvacres.com/languages_scifi_conehead.htm), one Zerl is equal to approximately 2.17 Earth years, thereby making their stay just over 15 years. Based on that fact, a giant plot hole emerges when INS agents and antagonists Gorman Seedling (Michael McKean) and Eli Turnbull (David Spade) don't age at all over that time period. Also, near the end, the rescue ship finally comes for the Coneheads, and it seems to take about a day to travel back to Remulak, their native planet. Although I thought the home planet in this movie was among the coolest parts, I still could not get over that plot hole. Why it took over a decade and a half to bring a ship over, yet it didn't take that long to go from Earth to Remulak and back, is never explained, and weakens the story a bit. However, other parts in the film otherwise made me laugh. The best parts were when the Coneheads interacted with humans in the outside world. Also, perhaps better than any other SNL movie to date, having numerous former and (then) current Not Ready For Primetime Players in various roles large and small served as a great tribute to "Saturday Night Live". There were also a few cameos from then-unknown stand-up comedians who would go on to be big stars (Ellen DeGeneres, Drew Carey, Eddie Griffin). "The Blues Brothers", "Wayne's World", and "Wayne's World 2" (1993) were hard movies to top, but "Coneheads", while not great, is pretty funny, and miles away from the notoriously bad SNL movies that were to come. It suffered mostly from its story line, but otherwise used special effects wisely to effectively elicit laughs. It's a good movie to watch after you have consumed mass quantities and want to get a good laugh while you digest.

Also, near the end, the rescue ship finally comes for the Coneheads, and it seems to take about a day to travel back to Remulak, their native planet. Although I thought the home planet in this movie was among the coolest parts, I still could not get over that plot hole. Why it took over a decade and a half to bring a ship over, yet it didn't take that long to go from Earth to Remulak and back, is never explained, and weakens the story a bit. However, other parts in the film otherwise made me laugh. The best parts were when the Coneheads interacted with humans in the outside world. Also, perhaps better than any other SNL movie to date, having numerous former and (then) current Not Ready For Primetime Players in various roles large and small served as a great tribute to "Saturday Night Live". There were also a few cameos from then-unknown stand-up comedians who would go on to be big stars (Ellen DeGeneres, Drew Carey, Eddie Griffin). "The Blues Brothers", "Wayne's World", and "Wayne's World 2" (1993) were hard movies to top, but "Coneheads", while not great, is pretty funny, and miles away from the notoriously bad SNL movies that were to come. It suffered mostly from its story line, but otherwise used special effects wisely to effectively elicit laughs. It's a good movie to watch after you have consumed mass quantities and want to get a good laugh while you digest.

    There's absolutely nothing - not a single thing - in this movie that can be taken seriously, which is probably why it's so enjoyable for the most part to watch. Based on a skit from Saturday Night Live (when SNL was really in its heyday) this is a fun look at the lives of the Coneheads - Beldar and Prymatt and their daughter Connie, a family of pointy headed aliens who get stuck on earth and have to blend in among the "bluntskulls," claiming to be from France (which no one ever questions) and enjoying such earth delicacies as "charred mammal flesh" and "flattened chicken embryos." Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin (as Beldar and Prymatt) demonstrate remarkable talent just in being able to get through this with relatively straight faces. Michelle Burke as the Conehead daughter Connie had a less demanding role - Connie having been born on earth had fewer adjustment issues to deal with. The part of the story dealing with the Coneheads being pursued by a couple of over-enthusiastic immigration agents (played by David Spade and Michael McKean) was perhaps an unnecessary addition to the story, and somehow the story seemed to lose its footing a bit once the Coneheads returned to their home planet of Remulak. In what was so obviously intended to be a silly movie, much of the Remulak storyline came across as too silly. Simply watching the Coneheads attempting to blend in to human society would have been sufficiently enjoyable. The movie has a surprisingly low rating here, suggesting to me that many people are perhaps treating it too seriously. It's a silly movie that's clearly intending to be a silly movie. To over-analyze it and look for weaknesses is to do it an injustice. Accept it for what it is and it will provide an overall very enjoyable 90 minutes.

    It isn't serious at all. What the writers, actors, and director did was take a repeating skit on SNL and expand it. In the process they made these rather odd alien characters familiar, flawed (and therefore human), and endearing. This is no small feat. They are odd in the extreme eating toilet paper, light bulbs, and talking in jargon laced monotone. But in doing that they also made life on earth and the simple pleasures we all enjoy, something to be appreciated...from an outsider's point of view. I think another thing that makes the movie a joy to watch is the high production values. It's a comedy about a richly detailed alien culture with first-rate sets, interesting devices, crazy and funny characters (most of the humans are deeply flawed) and some of the best stop-motion animation ever filmed. The Nafle the Garthog scene would have deeply impressed Ray Harryhausen. Continuity was high, the acting quite good (comedy is said to be the hardest thing to do), sets and scenery nicely done and the story itself with a nice easy to follow story arc and a (gasp) happy ending. What else would anyone want in the way of light entertainment?

    This one is such a classic. I don't know why so many people hate it. I found it very funny all the way through. What surprised me when viewing it after haven't seeing it for over 10 years is that most of the SNL cast is in this movie. I found them to be pretty funny. *Spoiler Alert* The movie revolves around a couple of aliens who get left on Earth and they can't leave Earth for a long period of time so the alien couple try to adapt on Earth by starting a family and living among the people of Earth. The movie is called Coneheads because of the top of their head is shaped like a cone. *End Spoiler* The movie is very funny. I would recommend everybody see this. I was pleasantly surprised to find it just as funny as I did 10 years ago. Don't worry, Dan Aykroyd and the rest of the SNL cast won't disappoint you. Pick it up for some good laughs.

    I could say, you had to be there. Or you just aren't old enough to understand. The bottom line? Sometimes it is nice to just sit back, suspend your disbelief and enjoy without having to analyze why it works or doesn't work. This falls back to a time when crude and rude was still in its infancy. Light for the day, it is still lots of fun. The punch lines are subtle and innuendo a bit advance for the punch and Judy crowd that is looking for the "Down with society" commentary that seems to fill the comedy of today. The Coneheads are classic Old School SNL. I like a story where the good guy wins, albeit the good guys in this case are Aliens. If you like Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis, or Danny Kay. Then you will probably like this movie. If you are the Dumb and Dumber crowd this will probably be a disappointment. So, suspend your disbeliefe and just enjoy it for what it is. A funny movie with a lot of "good" laughs.

    Aliens Beldar and Prymatt, with cone-shaped heads from the planet Remulak are mistakingly grounded on earth, during a scouting mission for planet conquest. While here, they dodge the INS, have a child and discover that life on Earth is quite good. But unfortunately they are being chased by the government who know something is not quite right with the Conehead family. After they are rescued and taken back to their planet, Belder is told to come back and destroy planet Earth.... This was straight to video here in the UK, and it's pretty clear as to why this happened. After the success of Waynes World, every SNL sketch thought it would have a crack at the movies, and while WW had a good narrative and background story, this is unoriginal stuff, and just an excuse for sight gags. Ackroyd is particularly bad in this, and I may be missing the whole point of the film, but only one person points out the abnormality. Maybe because the majority of folk in the USA are alien, or maybe because the writers just could not be bothered. Aside from cameos from lots of other below par comedians, Coneheads has nothing to offer, other than desperation from Ackroyd, who at one time was a comedic force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. Ghostbusters seems but a memory after seeing this trash

    I've never watched a microsecond of SNL so I watched this as just another film. It's not Gone with the Wind, but it doesn't pretend to be. It's a small scale comedy. It isn't 90 minutes of side splitting belly laughs, but it's mildly amusing throughout and there are a number of pretty good jokes. Flicking through the twenty or so movies my cable channel is offering me this evening, I'd prefer Coneheads to any of them. That doesn't make it a masterpiece, it just makes it a solid little comedy that will leave you more cheerful at the end than you were at the beginning. For those who like their comedy to be cutting edge with constant sarcastic political barbs, you should look elsewhere. (Is this why some reviewers don't like it - maybe they were expecting political satire ?) This isn't satire, it's mild smiley humour a la Ghostbusters, and none the worse for that.

    Aliens with cone shaped craniums (including Dan Aykroyd) come to Earth to observe everyday life. I am not sure which Saturday Night Live sketch was the first to be transformed into a movie, but at some point it became more and more common, and in the 1990s it seemed they could turn just about anything into a film. Some were hugely successful ("Wayne's World") while others have been largely forgotten ("It's Pat" and "Stuart Saves His Family" come to mind). I suppose "Coneheads" falls somewhere in the middle. By no means was it a flop, but I feel like it never really had a strong popularity. The best thing that came out of it was probably the soundtrack. But, perhaps wisely, the film is also not very ambitious and instead just wants to show a young woman coming of age and trying to be accepted by her peers. Not a bad little theme.

    This really is a hidden gem of a film. I can see how todays generation and their obsession with edgy humor, abrasive language,shock laughs, and depravity, couldn't appreciate this underrated comedy classic. It's clever, creative, well written, and Dan Akroyd is downright hilarious. How can you not burst out laughing when he tells Ronnie (Chris Farley)"I find you unacceptable. If I did not fear incarceration by human authority figures, I would terminate your life functions by applying sufficient force to your blunt skull  as to cause its collapse." The cameos from Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, David Spaid,Drew Carey, Jon Lovitz, Sinbad, and Jason Alexander all made for hilarious moments. It even managed to add some subtle social commentary without being preachy at all. Get your funny bones checked guys, this is a classic SNL film from when SNL was great.

    I recently saw "Coneheads" on TV, and, though is silly, sometimes has pleasant gags and funny moments. It's the story about a family of aliens who come to the Earth to reconnaissance it, and soon they are adapted to the life of America and its customs. But Mr. and Mrs. Conehead still yearn their native planet, though they had done a new life on Earth. As I said, this movie has great moments, but gets flat on the stretch. Not the best work of Dan Akyroyd, but it's still enjoyable. A funny quote: Beldar Conehead: An owner's manual to a Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable. Highmaster: Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable? Beldar Conehead: A personal conveyance named after its inventor, an assassinated ruler, a character from Greco-Roman myth and a small furry mammal. Highmaster: Ah.

    "Coneheads" is yet another film based on a recurring Saturday Night Live sketch. At the time of its release, it was the third SNL-based movie created following "The Blues Brothers" (1980) and "Wayne's World" (1992). While not as funny as the aforementioned films, it is only a notch below them. Worse SNL movies were to come (i.e. "It's Pat: The Movie" (1994), "A Night At The Roxbury" (1999)), but "Coneheads" stands today as a very funny mix of comedy and science fiction. The early Saturday Night Live sketches vaguely explained how the Coneheads came to Earth. Most of its humor came from the fact that the humans, or "blunt skulls", never suspected the Coneheads to be aliens from another planet, despite the oh-so obviously large foreheads. The fact that their last names are "Conehead" never seems to counter Earthlings' obliviousness, either. This movie takes some of its humor from the humans' obvious lack of observational skills, but it's really Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtan's consistent disappearance into these character that really makes the movie funny. They talk in monotone voices and spew out complicated alien jargon without missing a beat, and they use the film's special effects to their advantage. I also liked how, because the last Coneheads sketch was 14 years prior to this movie's release, the movie started from the beginning, explaining how Beldar (Aykroyd) and Prymatt (Curtan) landed on Earth in modern-day America, and worked their way from a hotel room to the projects to the suburbs. While I missed Laraine Newman as Connie (although Newman does make an appearance as Laarta, another Conehead in a later scene), it made perfect sense to have a younger, teenage Connie (Michelle Burke) with an American accent. Although the subplot where she begins dating 29-year-old mechanic Ronnie (Chris Farley) still seems creepy to me, considering her character was supposed to be 15 or 16, I thought Burke added a really nice touch to what could have been a Dan Aykroyd impersonation. The main conflict of the film served as an interesting analogy to illegal immigration, but had some definite plot holes. You find out in the film that Beldar and Prymatt land on Earth accidentally, and stay not because they want to, but because a rescue ship will take seven Zerl's to reach them. According to a site I found using Google (www.tvacres.com/languages_scifi_conehead.htm), one Zerl is equal to approximately 2.17 Earth years, thereby making their stay just over 15 years. Based on that fact, a giant plot hole emerges when INS agents and antagonists Gorman Seedling (Michael McKean) and Eli Turnbull (David Spade) don't age at all over that time period. Also, near the end, the rescue ship finally comes for the Coneheads, and it seems to take about a day to travel back to Remulak, their native planet. Although I thought the home planet in this movie was among the coolest parts, I still could not get over that plot hole. Why it took over a decade and a half to bring a ship over, yet it didn't take that long to go from Earth to Remulak and back, is never explained, and weakens the story a bit. However, other parts in the film otherwise made me laugh. The best parts were when the Coneheads interacted with humans in the outside world. Also, perhaps better than any other SNL movie to date, having numerous former and (then) current Not Ready For Primetime Players in various roles large and small served as a great tribute to "Saturday Night Live". There were also a few cameos from then-unknown stand-up comedians who would go on to be big stars (Ellen DeGeneres, Drew Carey, Eddie Griffin). "The Blues Brothers", "Wayne's World", and "Wayne's World 2" (1993) were hard movies to top, but "Coneheads", while not great, is pretty funny, and miles away from the notoriously bad SNL movies that were to come. It suffered mostly from its story line, but otherwise used special effects wisely to effectively elicit laughs.
