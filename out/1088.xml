    Jack Quinn is top counter-terrorist, and before his final mission he misses terrorist Stavros. During this epic battle, Quinn is wounded and sent to the Colony, where everyone else presumes he is dead. He is reassured by Belloq from Raiders, and gets fit by smoking cigarettes, and lifting a bath. Stavros had his son killed in the earlier fight and as revenge he is hunting Quinn's pregnant wife. Quinn joins forces with vivid arms dealer Yaz to fight Stavros, and a tiger..... This film, and Knock Off are easily Van Dammes most bizarre movie, but they are nothing short of entertaining. The editing is all over the shop, and the script is undoubtedly awful, but I had so much fun watching this, and still do every time I put it in my machine. Van Damme is as good as always, and Rourke as you would expect. Rodman, well he's in it, and that's all I can say. The fight scenes are awesome, some of the camera-work inspired, and the fact that it's on less than 90 minutes, only adds to the charm. Yes it may have lots and lots of flaws, but it's entertaining, and any film that involves a man kick shoes at Van Damme or the man kick a tiger, has to be seen.

    A logic-free action flick that stretches plausibility way beyond breaking point, Double Team stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as counter-terrorist expert Jack Quinn who, after a botched mission to kill international terrorist Stavros (Mickey Rourke), becomes an unwilling participant in a top secret think-tank on a remote island colony for agents that are considered 'too valuable to kill, but too dangerous to set free'. When Stavros (Mickey Rourke) abducts Jack's pregnant wife, having vowed revenge for the accidental death of his son during the earlier shootout, Jack escapes the colony, seeks help from an S&M freak gun dealer named Yaz (played by eccentric basketball bad-boy Dennis Rodman), and embarks on a dangerous rescue mission that culminates in an explosive showdown inside a coliseum. Opening with Quinn escaping from some bad guys by jumping a heavily armoured stolen vehicle through a speeding train (without the aid of a ramp), this film is completely crazy from the get go, and Hong Kong director Tsui Hark doesn't let the insanity subside until the very end, chucking in such spectacular nonsense as Van Damme kicking the crap out of bad guys while hanging from an air-plane cargo net, a Chinese killer who uses his knife with his foot, a top secret society of cyber-monks, and a finale that sees the good guys fight a tiger in the middle of a mine field before escaping certain death from fireball through the use of a Coke vending machine. Special mention must also be made of the incredible amount of glass that gets smashed during the film (usually because someone has been thrown through it). Although I'll never quite understand how this film got green-lit, I'm sure glad it did: a more enjoyably insane piece of 90s nonsense you'll be hard pushed to find. Call me crazy, but I rate Double Team 8 out of 10 simply for being so bloody silly.

    Jack Quinn(Jean Claude Van Damme, who gets to do plenty of the high kicks that he's famous for) retires from being a counter-terrorist, is brought back(yup, the clich&eacute;s, formulaic nature and stereotypes that drown every line of dialog and every other aspect of the writing in this come in right at the beginning) to take out Stavros(Rourke, who makes for a cool villain and comes off as a genuine match to him, in the realms of fighting and tactics), who used to... uh... well, now he's going to... hm... you know, I have no clue. Anyway, it goes wrong, his son dies in the chaos(this time, it's personal?), and JCVD is sent to The Colony, a secret(somehow...) think-tank comprised of former agents and enemies, leading us to wonder why they don't kill each other(and there literally appears to be no guards there... heck, even if it meant their death, they might be fanatic enough), they can move about though they have to check in at specific times. Along the way he also meets Yaz(...I know all three of those letters, but they don't go together like that), a world-class arms dealer(Rodman, who also gets to take part in the decently choreographed and covered martial arts of which there is a pretty good amount) in aÂ… let's call it a bi-curious nightclub, and they throw in some basketball references(because, and this may surprise you, apparently Dennis dabbled in that field, briefly). He's only in half of it, but he can't act and at times he doesn't seem capable of shutting up(man, does he get to be obnoxious). This is full of over the top action where physics take a back seat, there is excessive use of Dutch angles, and, like Speed, exhausting if you're not in the mood for it. Is it fun? Well, if you leave your brain at the door, and you aren't distracted by really goofy, out of place stuff... like this weird "focus" or sixth sense kind of thing to both the hero and bad guy. And the tigers. This is actually downright hard to follow at points, because of how... dumb it is. There is brief moderate to strong language in this. The DVD comes with a trailer. I recommend this to adrenaline junkies. 5/10

    For those who like movies that involve bombs, shots, broken glasses and lack of reason or reality, this movie will work. It's just one of those movies where Van Damme defeats his team (in this case, his double team) and we get to see some adrenalin scenes and we really want the main actor to win. Also, I was expecting to see more fight scenes and less easy kills with guns. You know, body fighting is much more thrilling and more entertaining than just shooting and killing. I remember enjoying his movies when I was younger, but nowadays I prefer a well written story/plot instead of cheap killing spree without a purpose. Anyways, not a bad movie at all, but isn't my type.

    A lot of people call "Indipendence Day" a "masterpiece" or a "good blockbuster". A lot of people call "Double Team" a "crappy movie" or a "plothole fest", since that people claims that "Indipendence Day" is a good movie, why i can't say that Double Team is cool and better than Indipendence Day ? The movie stars Jean Claude Van-Damme (playing the character Jack Quinn), i don't care about your opinion, most of people hate him because of his "bad acting" (seriously, do you care about acting ?), but he have a lot of potential and like in most of his movies, he shows good skills in martial arts. Dennis Rodman (playing the character Yaz), is another actor that everyone hates because of his "bad acting", but i liked his performance as a sidekick. Mickey Rourke (playing the character Stavros), plays the villain, good performance also. Double team is directed by Tsui Hark, a awesome Hong Kong director, i liked Double team as i liked his movies made in Hong Kong. The action scenes are great, we get both martial arts fighting and shootouts. The score is great also, the music in the credits by Crystal Waters (featuring: Dennis Rodman), made me watch it until the credits rolled to the last second. The cheesy CGI effects had their fashion. Also, there is a small surprise in the ending, involving coke vending machines, don't worry i am not going to spoil it. I am not expecting some academy award winner, it's an action movie ! Who care about plot holes ?

    The action-packed, globe-trotting Jean-Claude Van Damme adventure "Double Team" derives its sporty title from the unlikely combo of NBA bad boy Dennis Rodman and Van Damme in pursuit of arch foe Mickey Rourke. "Double Team" might have been drivel at a dribble were it not for the dazzling aplomb with which gifted Hong Kong action helmer Tsui Hark stages a number of snappy, hyperkinetic action sequences. Van Damme stars as Jack Quinn, the best counter-terrorist in the business, who retires and settles down with his wife Kathryn (French television actress Natacha Lindinger) to raise a family. His old bosses lure Jack back into the spy game to ice his oldest foe, Stavros (Mickey Rourke of "Sin City"). At an ambush in Antwerp, everything goes wrong. Quinn nearly dies from an explosion, and the wily Stavros eludes death. When Quinn recovers, he finds himself trapped on an island fortress called the Penal Colony with no hope for escape. The seas around the island are a maze of laser beams. The Colony guardian Goldsmythe (Paul Freeman), explains to Quinn that he is confined to the island for the remainder of his life in the dubious company of the deadliest spies in the world. Not only are they too valuable to terminate, but also that are too lethal to be let loose. According to Goldsmythe, the Penal Colony serves as an espionage think tank. Equipped with the latest high-tech gadgetry, these Penal Colony lifers act as consultants in resolving international disputes. Of course, Quinn devises a stunning escape plan based on split-second timing. Meanwhile, Stavros kidnaps his pregnant wife and sweeps her off to Rome. Stavros has every reason to hat Jack Quinn. Stavros took Quinn's wife as hostage. After he engineers a daring daylight escape, Quinn saves his wife from a ruthless death squad in the Eternal City. Although Kathryn gives birth to a baby boy, Stavros manages to stay a step ahead of Quinn and abducts the newborn. Quinn confronts Stavros in a land mine laden Roman Coliseum and battles a ravenous Bengal tiger. Our hero relieves heavily on the firepower provided by a weird underground CIA arms dealer named Yaz (Dennis Rodman) in both on Stavros. Yaz himself comes along to play against the bad guys in a bullet-scarred finale. Scenarists Don ("Lifeforce") Jakoby and Paul ("The Quest") Mones pull out all stops with an audacious, slam dunk script that resembles a James Bond extravaganza, complete with several exotic settings. Of course, the Jakoby & Mones' screenplay is thoroughly predictable, but these writers know how to tweak the formula with a fresh gag or two. Hong Kong action helmer Hark makes the third Royal Colony refugee that Van Damme has called on to direct his movies. Earlier, Van Damme tapped John Woo to call the shots on "Hard Target, but John Travolta has since wooed Woo to direct "Broken Arrow" and "Face/Off" with Nicolas Cage. In "Maximum Risk," Van Damme imported the services of the skilled Ringo Lam. Unlike both "Hard Target" and "Maximum Risk," "Double Team" takes its far-fetched plot to preposterously outlandish lengths. Hark never lets the supercharged action idle away in this stylist thriller. He enlivens the action sequences with the kind of bravura that make you want to flinch and duck. The fight between Van Damme and as Asian henchman who grips a switchblade between his toes is invigoratingly fresh. And the computerized cyber-monks in the Vatican are a scream. Jean-Claude Van Damme spends more time averting disaster than acting, but nobody watches a JCVD movie to see the star emote. Credit Van Damme with modeling the appropriate expression for each crisis. Mickey Rourke is the thespian to appreciate. His truly cool villain is an anthology of postures. If Paul Freeman, who plays the Penal Colony guardian, appears familiar, you may remember him as the adversary with whom Indiana Jones tangled in "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Meanwhile, Dennis Rodman is not so much an actor as he is a special effect. As Yaz, Rodman pedals a flashy arsenal for Van Damme as well as gives the film some of its lighter moments. When the initially encounter each other, Van Damme looks at Rodman and questions him about who does his hair? Siegfried or Roy? With a ring or a stud on most of his bodily appendages, an array of Yazoo Tattoos and his multicolored turf, Rodman looks as funny as he does lethal. The scene where Rodman steals a car that he has to steer with his head sticking through the sun roof is hilarious. Director Tsui Hark deploys the scene-stealing Rodman at the right moments to offset the straight-faced heroics of Van Damme. The worst thing that you can say about "Double Team" is the shameless product placement scene in the Coliseum. A number of Coke machine keep our heroes from getting cremated by the usual quota of apocalyptic explosions. On the other hand, the scene where scores of Coke cans complicate the heroics of Jean-Claude is good. If you are a JCVD fan, you get to see our protagonist articulate his muscles from Brussels in a couple of well-choreographed combat sequences. If you enjoy watching glossy, superbly lensed action movies, "Double Team" ought to keep you entertained and occupied. The inventive script, the electrifying directing, and the stirring Gary Chang music contribute to the success of "Double Team."

    courtesy of www.PopBunker.net We've all had it happen. A day will be going merrily along with normal annoyances and accomplishments. Then suddenly, out random chaos, something triggers the memory of an innocent of something so profoundly awful and cringe-inducing that all he wishes is that the memory would have stayed forgotten. Sometimes the buried memory is in the form of an embarrassing moment; like taking out one's junk and swinging it around at a wedding reception. And other times it is bewildering reminders of craptacular movies like Double Team. My day "job" includes managing an online inventory. Recently we obtained around 300 DVDs to add to our online and brick and mortar inventory. Usually I don't pay attention to titles when mindlessly adding to our inventory. But yesterday I was struck as if by a malevolent satorie when this DVD came through. I tweeted about it and got back a few colorful responses with regards to re-opening this wound of a movie in the minds of many. So what was so awful about "Double Team?" Well, first of all the name: Double Team. Everyone is entitled to his most far-fetched fantasy, but I can't imagine anyone Â– not even the most strong stomach celeb stalker Â– wanting to be doubled teamed by JCVD and Dennis Rodman. It would be like having a fantasy involving a threesome with Larry King and Frances Bay (Granda from Happy Gilmore) while everyone wears a KISS mask. It just doesn't compute even to the most perverse of minds. The next thingÂ… wellÂ… Dennis Rodman. I mean just image google his name. Or don't. Be who you wanna be, kid. It's all good. But to be who Rodman is and mix that with the absolute fact that he can act about as well as he shot three-pointers (23.1%) makes a mess recipe for a movie. "Double Team" even had Mickey Rourke when he was an a-hole everyone hated instead of The Wrestler reborn a-hole that everyone suddenly thinks is cool because he is in Iron Man 2. (A side note: Rourke is the ultimate retro-cool has-been a-hole re-made into the suddenly in-demand cool a-hole that soon everyone will remember is an a-hole and will be cast aside once again. It's a crazy business.) The last thing I'm going to point out in "what was so awful aboutÂ…" is that it was a stone cold career killer for JCVD. It may well be that JCVD was going to have a short career arc as a major action player anyway, but in the three years leading up to "Double Team," he was in Timecop (1994), Streetfighter & Sudden Death (1995), The Quest & Maximum Risk (1996). "Double Team" flushed down in 1997 and thenÂ… that was it. I think everything after "Double Team" was a direct-to-DVD or limited release for JCVD. JCVD was not known for quality cinema, but he was known for exploitative movies made for men who love movies made for men. JCVD movies were cheap to make and did enough bank at the box officeÂ… until "Double Team." Not even men who love movies made for men could love JCVD after he was in a movie with Dennis Rodman that, if I remember correctly, featured a fight or chase or something where Rodman's mode of attack was Grabbing a Rebound Kung-fu or some ridiculous junk like that. I know it involved a gratuitously out of place basketball reference somehow. courtesy of www.PopBunker.net

    This is not a very good movie, but pretty good, stylish and enjoyable, so one of Van Damme's bests. I don't see Jean Claude Van Damme as a bad actor, may be because I like him, he was one of my childhood heroes. It seems that he did what people wanted from him. Some say that he is hopelessly untalented, but he has a pulling power, hasn't he? Otherwise, now there would not have been a lot of Van Damme fans, even if they have lessened day after day. I watched almost all his films except his first movie and a few of his recent movies and to me Double Team is from his golden period. By the way, I learned that Tsui Hark hates John Woo's The Killer. If you ask me, he is absolutely right. Because according to many people The Killer is a great action film, but to it was extremely slow paced except the final part and not stylish. Probably, like me, Hark had sat down to watch an action movie, but it was not. Double Team is non stop action. In comparison with some recent soap bubble and very slow paced action movies like The Sentinel or The Shooter, Double Team is not only very fast paced, but also pretty stylish. However, the most odd thing is that even the ratings of the awful movies of Van Damme such as Second in Command, Wake of Death, In Hell, The Order or Inferno are higher than Double Team. ??? The whole movie is fun owing to Hark, Van Damme and Rodman who adds color to the movie. Watching Rourke who brings a pessimistic tone to the movie is also interesting. The operation in the funfair part consists of very stylish action scenes. This colorful part is one of the best parts of the movie. As you know, all of the early Van Damme films include training scenes, they are famous for those scenes, too (to me) In Double Team, there is a training scene too. The only flawed point comes in the end, the end was unrealistic with bad CGI. And the images I have not forgotten since 1997. The face of Van Damme in the end of the hospital scene, the face of Mickey Rourke in the stadium, finger scene and Rodman's question: ''Did you open it?''

    Jack Quinn(Jean Claude Van Damme, who gets to do plenty of the high kicks that he's famous for) retires from being a counter-terrorist, is brought back(yup, the clich&eacute;s, formulaic nature and stereotypes that drown every line of dialog and every other aspect of the writing in this come in right at the beginning) to take out Stavros(Rourke, who makes for a cool villain and comes off as a genuine match to him, in the realms of fighting and tactics), who used to... uh... well, now he's going to... hm... you know, I have no clue. Anyway, it goes wrong, his son dies in the chaos(this time, it's personal?), and JCVD is sent to The Colony, a secret(somehow...) think-tank comprised of former agents and enemies, leading us to wonder why they don't kill each other(and there literally appears to be no guards there... heck, even if it meant their death, they might be fanatic enough), they can move about though they have to check in at specific times. Along the way he also meets Yaz(...I know all three of those letters, but they don't go together like that), a world-class arms dealer(Rodman, who also gets to take part in the decently choreographed and covered martial arts of which there is a pretty good amount) in aÂ… let's call it a bi-curious nightclub, and they throw in some basketball references(because, and this may surprise you, apparently Dennis dabbled in that field, briefly). He's only in half of it, but he can't act and at times he doesn't seem capable of shutting up(man, does he get to be obnoxious). This is full of over the top action where physics take a back seat, there is excessive use of Dutch angles, and, like Speed, exhausting if you're not in the mood for it. Is it fun? Well, if you leave your brain at the door, and you aren't distracted by really goofy, out of place stuff... like this weird "focus" or sixth sense kind of thing to both the hero and bad guy. And the tigers. This is actually downright hard to follow at points, because of how... dumb it is. There is brief moderate to strong language in this. The DVD comes with a trailer. I recommend this to adrenaline junkies. 5/10

    For those who like movies that involve bombs, shots, broken glasses and lack of reason or reality, this movie will work. It's just one of those movies where Van Damme defeats his team (in this case, his double team) and we get to see some adrenalin scenes and we really want the main actor to win. Also, I was expecting to see more fight scenes and less easy kills with guns. You know, body fighting is much more thrilling and more entertaining than just shooting and killing. I remember enjoying his movies when I was younger, but nowadays I prefer a well written story/plot instead of cheap killing spree without a purpose. Anyways, not a bad movie at all, but isn't my type.

    A lot of people call "Indipendence Day" a "masterpiece" or a "good blockbuster". A lot of people call "Double Team" a "crappy movie" or a "plothole fest", since that people claims that "Indipendence Day" is a good movie, why i can't say that Double Team is cool and better than Indipendence Day ? The movie stars Jean Claude Van-Damme (playing the character Jack Quinn), i don't care about your opinion, most of people hate him because of his "bad acting" (seriously, do you care about acting ?), but he have a lot of potential and like in most of his movies, he shows good skills in martial arts. Dennis Rodman (playing the character Yaz), is another actor that everyone hates because of his "bad acting", but i liked his performance as a sidekick. Mickey Rourke (playing the character Stavros), plays the villain, good performance also. Double team is directed by Tsui Hark, a awesome Hong Kong director, i liked Double team as i liked his movies made in Hong Kong. The action scenes are great, we get both martial arts fighting and shootouts. The score is great also, the music in the credits by Crystal Waters (featuring: Dennis Rodman), made me watch it until the credits rolled to the last second. The cheesy CGI effects had their fashion. Also, there is a small surprise in the ending, involving coke vending machines, don't worry i am not going to spoil it. I am not expecting some academy award winner, it's an action movie !

    The action-packed, globe-trotting Jean-Claude Van Damme adventure "Double Team" derives its sporty title from the unlikely combo of NBA bad boy Dennis Rodman and Van Damme in pursuit of arch foe Mickey Rourke. "Double Team" might have been drivel at a dribble were it not for the dazzling aplomb with which gifted Hong Kong action helmer Tsui Hark stages a number of snappy, hyperkinetic action sequences. Van Damme stars as Jack Quinn, the best counter-terrorist in the business, who retires and settles down with his wife Kathryn (French television actress Natacha Lindinger) to raise a family. His old bosses lure Jack back into the spy game to ice his oldest foe, Stavros (Mickey Rourke of "Sin City"). At an ambush in Antwerp, everything goes wrong. Quinn nearly dies from an explosion, and the wily Stavros eludes death. When Quinn recovers, he finds himself trapped on an island fortress called the Penal Colony with no hope for escape. The seas around the island are a maze of laser beams. The Colony guardian Goldsmythe (Paul Freeman), explains to Quinn that he is confined to the island for the remainder of his life in the dubious company of the deadliest spies in the world. Not only are they too valuable to terminate, but also that are too lethal to be let loose. According to Goldsmythe, the Penal Colony serves as an espionage think tank. Equipped with the latest high-tech gadgetry, these Penal Colony lifers act as consultants in resolving international disputes. Of course, Quinn devises a stunning escape plan based on split-second timing. Meanwhile, Stavros kidnaps his pregnant wife and sweeps her off to Rome. Stavros has every reason to hat Jack Quinn. Stavros took Quinn's wife as hostage. After he engineers a daring daylight escape, Quinn saves his wife from a ruthless death squad in the Eternal City. Although Kathryn gives birth to a baby boy, Stavros manages to stay a step ahead of Quinn and abducts the newborn. Quinn confronts Stavros in a land mine laden Roman Coliseum and battles a ravenous Bengal tiger. Our hero relieves heavily on the firepower provided by a weird underground CIA arms dealer named Yaz (Dennis Rodman) in both on Stavros. Yaz himself comes along to play against the bad guys in a bullet-scarred finale. Scenarists Don ("Lifeforce") Jakoby and Paul ("The Quest") Mones pull out all stops with an audacious, slam dunk script that resembles a James Bond extravaganza, complete with several exotic settings. Of course, the Jakoby & Mones' screenplay is thoroughly predictable, but these writers know how to tweak the formula with a fresh gag or two. Hong Kong action helmer Hark makes the third Royal Colony refugee that Van Damme has called on to direct his movies. Earlier, Van Damme tapped John Woo to call the shots on "Hard Target, but John Travolta has since wooed Woo to direct "Broken Arrow" and "Face/Off" with Nicolas Cage. In "Maximum Risk," Van Damme imported the services of the skilled Ringo Lam. Unlike both "Hard Target" and "Maximum Risk," "Double Team" takes its far-fetched plot to preposterously outlandish lengths. Hark never lets the supercharged action idle away in this stylist thriller. He enlivens the action sequences with the kind of bravura that make you want to flinch and duck. The fight between Van Damme and as Asian henchman who grips a switchblade between his toes is invigoratingly fresh. And the computerized cyber-monks in the Vatican are a scream. Jean-Claude Van Damme spends more time averting disaster than acting, but nobody watches a JCVD movie to see the star emote. Credit Van Damme with modeling the appropriate expression for each crisis. Mickey Rourke is the thespian to appreciate. His truly cool villain is an anthology of postures. If Paul Freeman, who plays the Penal Colony guardian, appears familiar, you may remember him as the adversary with whom Indiana Jones tangled in "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Meanwhile, Dennis Rodman is not so much an actor as he is a special effect. As Yaz, Rodman pedals a flashy arsenal for Van Damme as well as gives the film some of its lighter moments. When the initially encounter each other, Van Damme looks at Rodman and questions him about who does his hair? Siegfried or Roy? With a ring or a stud on most of his bodily appendages, an array of Yazoo Tattoos and his multicolored turf, Rodman looks as funny as he does lethal. The scene where Rodman steals a car that he has to steer with his head sticking through the sun roof is hilarious. Director Tsui Hark deploys the scene-stealing Rodman at the right moments to offset the straight-faced heroics of Van Damme. The worst thing that you can say about "Double Team" is the shameless product placement scene in the Coliseum. A number of Coke machine keep our heroes from getting cremated by the usual quota of apocalyptic explosions. On the other hand, the scene where scores of Coke cans complicate the heroics of Jean-Claude is good. If you are a JCVD fan, you get to see our protagonist articulate his muscles from Brussels in a couple of well-choreographed combat sequences. If you enjoy watching glossy, superbly lensed action movies, "Double Team" ought to keep you entertained and occupied. The inventive script, the electrifying directing, and the stirring Gary Chang music contribute to the success of "Double Team."

    courtesy of www.PopBunker.net We've all had it happen. A day will be going merrily along with normal annoyances and accomplishments. Then suddenly, out random chaos, something triggers the memory of an innocent of something so profoundly awful and cringe-inducing that all he wishes is that the memory would have stayed forgotten. Sometimes the buried memory is in the form of an embarrassing moment; like taking out one's junk and swinging it around at a wedding reception. And other times it is bewildering reminders of craptacular movies like Double Team. My day "job" includes managing an online inventory. Recently we obtained around 300 DVDs to add to our online and brick and mortar inventory. Usually I don't pay attention to titles when mindlessly adding to our inventory. But yesterday I was struck as if by a malevolent satorie when this DVD came through. I tweeted about it and got back a few colorful responses with regards to re-opening this wound of a movie in the minds of many. So what was so awful about "Double Team?" Well, first of all the name: Double Team. Everyone is entitled to his most far-fetched fantasy, but I can't imagine anyone Â– not even the most strong stomach celeb stalker Â– wanting to be doubled teamed by JCVD and Dennis Rodman. It would be like having a fantasy involving a threesome with Larry King and Frances Bay (Granda from Happy Gilmore) while everyone wears a KISS mask. It just doesn't compute even to the most perverse of minds. The next thingÂ… wellÂ… Dennis Rodman. I mean just image google his name. Or don't. Be who you wanna be, kid. It's all good. But to be who Rodman is and mix that with the absolute fact that he can act about as well as he shot three-pointers (23.1%) makes a mess recipe for a movie. "Double Team" even had Mickey Rourke when he was an a-hole everyone hated instead of The Wrestler reborn a-hole that everyone suddenly thinks is cool because he is in Iron Man 2. (A side note: Rourke is the ultimate retro-cool has-been a-hole re-made into the suddenly in-demand cool a-hole that soon everyone will remember is an a-hole and will be cast aside once again. It's a crazy business.) The last thing I'm going to point out in "what was so awful aboutÂ…" is that it was a stone cold career killer for JCVD. It may well be that JCVD was going to have a short career arc as a major action player anyway, but in the three years leading up to "Double Team," he was in Timecop (1994), Streetfighter & Sudden Death (1995), The Quest & Maximum Risk (1996). "Double Team" flushed down in 1997 and thenÂ… that was it. I think everything after "Double Team" was a direct-to-DVD or limited release for JCVD. JCVD was not known for quality cinema, but he was known for exploitative movies made for men who love movies made for men. JCVD movies were cheap to make and did enough bank at the box officeÂ… until "Double Team." Not even men who love movies made for men could love JCVD after he was in a movie with Dennis Rodman that, if I remember correctly, featured a fight or chase or something where Rodman's mode of attack was Grabbing a Rebound Kung-fu or some ridiculous junk like that. I know it involved a gratuitously out of place basketball reference somehow. courtesy of www.PopBunker.net

    This is not a very good movie, but pretty good, stylish and enjoyable, so one of Van Damme's bests. I don't see Jean Claude Van Damme as a bad actor, may be because I like him, he was one of my childhood heroes. It seems that he did what people wanted from him. Some say that he is hopelessly untalented, but he has a pulling power, hasn't he? Otherwise, now there would not have been a lot of Van Damme fans, even if they have lessened day after day. I watched almost all his films except his first movie and a few of his recent movies and to me Double Team is from his golden period. By the way, I learned that Tsui Hark hates John Woo's The Killer. If you ask me, he is absolutely right. Because according to many people The Killer is a great action film, but to it was extremely slow paced except the final part and not stylish. Probably, like me, Hark had sat down to watch an action movie, but it was not. Double Team is non stop action. In comparison with some recent soap bubble and very slow paced action movies like The Sentinel or The Shooter, Double Team is not only very fast paced, but also pretty stylish. However, the most odd thing is that even the ratings of the awful movies of Van Damme such as Second in Command, Wake of Death, In Hell, The Order or Inferno are higher than Double Team. ??? The whole movie is fun owing to Hark, Van Damme and Rodman who adds color to the movie. Watching Rourke who brings a pessimistic tone to the movie is also interesting. The operation in the funfair part consists of very stylish action scenes. This colorful part is one of the best parts of the movie. As you know, all of the early Van Damme films include training scenes, they are famous for those scenes, too (to me) In Double Team, there is a training scene too. The only flawed point comes in the end, the end was unrealistic with bad CGI. And the images I have not forgotten since 1997. The face of Van Damme in the end of the hospital scene, the face of Mickey Rourke in the stadium, finger scene and Rodman's question: ''Did you open it?''

    i can see why people hate this movie so bad i know it's a bit silly and i am Big Fan Of Jean Claude Van Damme and Mickey Rourke and Dennis Rodman was Awesome and Funny but not much as Action Star didn't do much of Movies and in this movie was pretty awesome seeing Van Damme fighting with Rourke and movie wasn't that bad come on if your fan van Damme fan you should enjoy this movie it's fun Movie i don't care what people say and the opening scene when van damme driving the big truck in opening scene was cool and part in of Dennis was funny but they could of got Wesley Snipes rather then Dennis Rodman but it doesn't matter it's still good idea for me and Quinn escapes from the colony and goes after Stavroes for revenge. Quinn is helped by Yaz Dennis Rodman Double Team they helping each another in mission to get his wife and baby and fight scenes with Van and Mickey was Awesome but i know Mickey Rourke doesn't like van Damme with some reason i don't know about but the fight scenes was fun didn't go for that long but you don't need to see long as showdown when van Damme fights were amazing like in Bloodsport if you enjoy Hard Target and Double Impact and Knock off and Kickboxer and Bloodsport this is fun movie that you will Enjoy for Van Damme Fans like this only 4.4 i will give this 7.10

    Jack Quinn is top counter-terrorist, and before his final mission he misses terrorist Stavros. During this epic battle, Quinn is wounded and sent to the Colony, where everyone else presumes he is dead. He is reassured by Belloq from Raiders, and gets fit by smoking cigarettes, and lifting a bath. Stavros had his son killed in the earlier fight and as revenge he is hunting Quinn's pregnant wife. Quinn joins forces with vivid arms dealer Yaz to fight Stavros, and a tiger..... This film, and Knock Off are easily Van Dammes most bizarre movie, but they are nothing short of entertaining. The editing is all over the shop, and the script is undoubtedly awful, but I had so much fun watching this, and still do every time I put it in my machine. Van Damme is as good as always, and Rourke as you would expect. Rodman, well he's in it, and that's all I can say. The fight scenes are awesome, some of the camera-work inspired, and the fact that it's on less than 90 minutes, only adds to the charm. Yes it may have lots and lots of flaws, but it's entertaining, and any film that involves a man kick shoes at Van Damme or the man kick a tiger, has to be seen.

    A logic-free action flick that stretches plausibility way beyond breaking point, Double Team stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as counter-terrorist expert Jack Quinn who, after a botched mission to kill international terrorist Stavros (Mickey Rourke), becomes an unwilling participant in a top secret think-tank on a remote island colony for agents that are considered 'too valuable to kill, but too dangerous to set free'. When Stavros (Mickey Rourke) abducts Jack's pregnant wife, having vowed revenge for the accidental death of his son during the earlier shootout, Jack escapes the colony, seeks help from an S&M freak gun dealer named Yaz (played by eccentric basketball bad-boy Dennis Rodman), and embarks on a dangerous rescue mission that culminates in an explosive showdown inside a coliseum. Opening with Quinn escaping from some bad guys by jumping a heavily armoured stolen vehicle through a speeding train (without the aid of a ramp), this film is completely crazy from the get go, and Hong Kong director Tsui Hark doesn't let the insanity subside until the very end, chucking in such spectacular nonsense as Van Damme kicking the crap out of bad guys while hanging from an air-plane cargo net, a Chinese killer who uses his knife with his foot, a top secret society of cyber-monks, and a finale that sees the good guys fight a tiger in the middle of a mine field before escaping certain death from fireball through the use of a Coke vending machine. Special mention must also be made of the incredible amount of glass that gets smashed during the film (usually because someone has been thrown through it). Although I'll never quite understand how this film got green-lit, I'm sure glad it did: a more enjoyably insane piece of 90s nonsense you'll be hard pushed to find. Call me crazy, but I rate Double Team 8 out of 10 simply for being so bloody silly.

    i can totally understand why some van damme fans don't like this movie, i mean apart from the cast, and the story, its a hong kong action movie, and anybody who knows anything about action cinema, know they are the kings of it. tsu hark is a brilliant director 'once upon a time in china', but i didn't think much of his other van damme collaboration 'knock off'. but gladly this movie is a lot better, and offers some top notch action, and fight scenes. sure dennis rodman looks out of place, but any movie with a smackdown vs van damme and micky rourke cant be anything but great. now a lot of the bad reviews commented on how far fetched it is, and believe me it is, but arnt most hong kong films. never the less i think its a brilliant action movie and one of van damme's best movies of the 90's i recommend

If Paul Freeman, who plays the Penal Colony guardian, appears familiar, you may remember him as the adversary with whom Indiana Jones tangled in "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Meanwhile, Dennis Rodman is not so much an actor as he is a special effect. As Yaz, Rodman pedals a flashy arsenal for Van Damme as well as gives the film some of its lighter moments. When the initially encounter each other, Van Damme looks at Rodman and questions him about who does his hair? Siegfried or Roy? With a ring or a stud on most of his bodily appendages, an array of Yazoo Tattoos and his multicolored turf, Rodman looks as funny as he does lethal. The scene where Rodman steals a car that he has to steer with his head sticking through the sun roof is hilarious. Director Tsui Hark deploys the scene-stealing Rodman at the right moments to offset the straight-faced heroics of Van Damme. The worst thing that you can say about "Double Team" is the shameless product placement scene in the Coliseum. A number of Coke machine keep our heroes from getting cremated by the usual quota of apocalyptic explosions. On the other hand, the scene where scores of Coke cans complicate the heroics of Jean-Claude is good. If you are a JCVD fan, you get to see our protagonist articulate his muscles from Brussels in a couple of well-choreographed combat sequences. If you enjoy watching glossy, superbly lensed action movies, "Double Team" ought to keep you entertained and occupied. The inventive script, the electrifying directing, and the stirring Gary Chang music contribute to the success of "Double Team."

    courtesy of www.PopBunker.net We've all had it happen. A day will be going merrily along with normal annoyances and accomplishments. Then suddenly, out random chaos, something triggers the memory of an innocent of something so profoundly awful and cringe-inducing that all he wishes is that the memory would have stayed forgotten. Sometimes the buried memory is in the form of an embarrassing moment; like taking out one's junk and swinging it around at a wedding reception. And other times it is bewildering reminders of craptacular movies like Double Team. My day "job" includes managing an online inventory. Recently we obtained around 300 DVDs to add to our online and brick and mortar inventory. Usually I don't pay attention to titles when mindlessly adding to our inventory. But yesterday I was struck as if by a malevolent satorie when this DVD came through. I tweeted about it and got back a few colorful responses with regards to re-opening this wound of a movie in the minds of many. So what was so awful about "Double Team?" Well, first of all the name: Double Team. Everyone is entitled to his most far-fetched fantasy, but I can't imagine anyone Â– not even the most strong stomach celeb stalker Â– wanting to be doubled teamed by JCVD and Dennis Rodman. It would be like having a fantasy involving a threesome with Larry King and Frances Bay (Granda from Happy Gilmore) while everyone wears a KISS mask. It just doesn't compute even to the most perverse of minds. The next thingÂ… wellÂ… Dennis Rodman. I mean just image google his name. Or don't. Be who you wanna be, kid. It's all good. But to be who Rodman is and mix that with the absolute fact that he can act about as well as he shot three-pointers (23.1%) makes a mess recipe for a movie. "Double Team" even had Mickey Rourke when he was an a-hole everyone hated instead of The Wrestler reborn a-hole that everyone suddenly thinks is cool because he is in Iron Man 2. (A side note: Rourke is the ultimate retro-cool has-been a-hole re-made into the suddenly in-demand cool a-hole that soon everyone will remember is an a-hole and will be cast aside once again. It's a crazy business.) The last thing I'm going to point out in "what was so awful aboutÂ…" is that it was a stone cold career killer for JCVD. It may well be that JCVD was going to have a short career arc as a major action player anyway, but in the three years leading up to "Double Team," he was in Timecop (1994), Streetfighter & Sudden Death (1995), The Quest & Maximum Risk (1996). "Double Team" flushed down in 1997 and thenÂ… that was it. I think everything after "Double Team" was a direct-to-DVD or limited release for JCVD. JCVD was not known for quality cinema, but he was known for exploitative movies made for men who love movies made for men. JCVD movies were cheap to make and did enough bank at the box officeÂ… until "Double Team." Not even men who love movies made for men could love JCVD after he was in a movie with Dennis Rodman that, if I remember correctly, featured a fight or chase or something where Rodman's mode of attack was Grabbing a Rebound Kung-fu or some ridiculous junk like that. I know it involved a gratuitously out of place basketball reference somehow. courtesy of www.PopBunker.net

    This is not a very good movie, but pretty good, stylish and enjoyable, so one of Van Damme's bests. I don't see Jean Claude Van Damme as a bad actor, may be because I like him, he was one of my childhood heroes. It seems that he did what people wanted from him. Some say that he is hopelessly untalented, but he has a pulling power, hasn't he? Otherwise, now there would not have been a lot of Van Damme fans, even if they have lessened day after day. I watched almost all his films except his first movie and a few of his recent movies and to me Double Team is from his golden period. By the way, I learned that Tsui Hark hates John Woo's The Killer. If you ask me, he is absolutely right. Because according to many people The Killer is a great action film, but to it was extremely slow paced except the final part and not stylish. Probably, like me, Hark had sat down to watch an action movie, but it was not. Double Team is non stop action. In comparison with some recent soap bubble and very slow paced action movies like The Sentinel or The Shooter, Double Team is not only very fast paced, but also pretty stylish. However, the most odd thing is that even the ratings of the awful movies of Van Damme such as Second in Command, Wake of Death, In Hell, The Order or Inferno are higher than Double Team. ??? The whole movie is fun owing to Hark, Van Damme and Rodman who adds color to the movie. Watching Rourke who brings a pessimistic tone to the movie is also interesting. The operation in the funfair part consists of very stylish action scenes. This colorful part is one of the best parts of the movie. As you know, all of the early Van Damme films include training scenes, they are famous for those scenes, too (to me) In Double Team, there is a training scene too. The only flawed point comes in the end, the end was unrealistic with bad CGI. And the images I have not forgotten since 1997. The face of Van Damme in the end of the hospital scene, the face of Mickey Rourke in the stadium, finger scene and Rodman's question: ''Did you open it?''

    i can see why people hate this movie so bad i know it's a bit silly and i am Big Fan Of Jean Claude Van Damme and Mickey Rourke and Dennis Rodman was Awesome and Funny but not much as Action Star didn't do much of Movies and in this movie was pretty awesome seeing Van Damme fighting with Rourke and movie wasn't that bad come on if your fan van Damme fan you should enjoy this movie it's fun Movie i don't care what people say and the opening scene when van damme driving the big truck in opening scene was cool and part in of Dennis was funny but they could of got Wesley Snipes rather then Dennis Rodman but it doesn't matter it's still good idea for me and Quinn escapes from the colony and goes after Stavroes for revenge. Quinn is helped by Yaz Dennis Rodman Double Team they helping each another in mission to get his wife and baby and fight scenes with Van and Mickey was Awesome but i know Mickey Rourke doesn't like van Damme with some reason i don't know about but the fight scenes was fun didn't go for that long but you don't need to see long as showdown when van Damme fights were amazing like in Bloodsport if you enjoy Hard Target and Double Impact and Knock off and Kickboxer and Bloodsport this is fun movie that you will Enjoy for Van Damme Fans like this only 4.4 i will give this 7.10

    Jack Quinn is top counter-terrorist, and before his final mission he misses terrorist Stavros. During this epic battle, Quinn is wounded and sent to the Colony, where everyone else presumes he is dead. He is reassured by Belloq from Raiders, and gets fit by smoking cigarettes, and lifting a bath. Stavros had his son killed in the earlier fight and as revenge he is hunting Quinn's pregnant wife. Quinn joins forces with vivid arms dealer Yaz to fight Stavros, and a tiger..... This film, and Knock Off are easily Van Dammes most bizarre movie, but they are nothing short of entertaining. The editing is all over the shop, and the script is undoubtedly awful, but I had so much fun watching this, and still do every time I put it in my machine. Van Damme is as good as always, and Rourke as you would expect. Rodman, well he's in it, and that's all I can say. The fight scenes are awesome, some of the camera-work inspired, and the fact that it's on less than 90 minutes, only adds to the charm. Yes it may have lots and lots of flaws, but it's entertaining, and any film that involves a man kick shoes at Van Damme or the man kick a tiger, has to be seen.

    A logic-free action flick that stretches plausibility way beyond breaking point, Double Team stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as counter-terrorist expert Jack Quinn who, after a botched mission to kill international terrorist Stavros (Mickey Rourke), becomes an unwilling participant in a top secret think-tank on a remote island colony for agents that are considered 'too valuable to kill, but too dangerous to set free'. When Stavros (Mickey Rourke) abducts Jack's pregnant wife, having vowed revenge for the accidental death of his son during the earlier shootout, Jack escapes the colony, seeks help from an S&M freak gun dealer named Yaz (played by eccentric basketball bad-boy Dennis Rodman), and embarks on a dangerous rescue mission that culminates in an explosive showdown inside a coliseum. Opening with Quinn escaping from some bad guys by jumping a heavily armoured stolen vehicle through a speeding train (without the aid of a ramp), this film is completely crazy from the get go, and Hong Kong director Tsui Hark doesn't let the insanity subside until the very end, chucking in such spectacular nonsense as Van Damme kicking the crap out of bad guys while hanging from an air-plane cargo net, a Chinese killer who uses his knife with his foot, a top secret society of cyber-monks, and a finale that sees the good guys fight a tiger in the middle of a mine field before escaping certain death from fireball through the use of a Coke vending machine. Special mention must also be made of the incredible amount of glass that gets smashed during the film (usually because someone has been thrown through it). Although I'll never quite understand how this film got green-lit, I'm sure glad it did: a more enjoyably insane piece of 90s nonsense you'll be hard pushed to find. Call me crazy, but I rate Double Team 8 out of 10 simply for being so bloody silly.

    i can totally understand why some van damme fans don't like this movie, i mean apart from the cast, and the story, its a hong kong action movie, and anybody who knows anything about action cinema, know they are the kings of it. tsu hark is a brilliant director 'once upon a time in china', but i didn't think much of his other van damme collaboration 'knock off'. but gladly this movie is a lot better, and offers some top notch action, and fight scenes. sure dennis rodman looks out of place, but any movie with a smackdown vs van damme and micky rourke cant be anything but great. now a lot of the bad reviews commented on how far fetched it is, and believe me it is, but arnt most hong kong films. never the less i think its a brilliant action movie and one of van damme's best movies of the 90's i recommend

    Jack Quinn(Jean Claude Van Damme, who gets to do plenty of the high kicks that he's famous for) retires from being a counter-terrorist, is brought back(yup, the clich&eacute;s, formulaic nature and stereotypes that drown every line of dialog and every other aspect of the writing in this come in right at the beginning) to take out Stavros(Rourke, who makes for a cool villain and comes off as a genuine match to him, in the realms of fighting and tactics), who used to... uh... well, now he's going to... hm... you know, I have no clue. Anyway, it goes wrong, his son dies in the chaos(this time, it's personal?), and JCVD is sent to The Colony, a secret(somehow...) think-tank comprised of former agents and enemies, leading us to wonder why they don't kill each other(and there literally appears to be no guards there... heck, even if it meant their death, they might be fanatic enough), they can move about though they have to check in at specific times. Along the way he also meets Yaz(...I know all three of those letters, but they don't go together like that), a world-class arms dealer(Rodman, who also gets to take part in the decently choreographed and covered martial arts of which there is a pretty good amount) in aÂ… let's call it a bi-curious nightclub, and they throw in some basketball references(because, and this may surprise you, apparently Dennis dabbled in that field, briefly). He's only in half of it, but he can't act and at times he doesn't seem capable of shutting up(man, does he get to be obnoxious). This is full of over the top action where physics take a back seat, there is excessive use of Dutch angles, and, like Speed, exhausting if you're not in the mood for it. Is it fun? Well, if you leave your brain at the door, and you aren't distracted by really goofy, out of place stuff... like this weird "focus" or sixth sense kind of thing to both the hero and bad guy. And the tigers. This is actually downright hard to follow at points, because of how... dumb it is. There is brief moderate to strong language in this. The DVD comes with a trailer. I recommend this to adrenaline junkies. 5/10

    For those who like movies that involve bombs, shots, broken glasses and lack of reason or reality, this movie will work. It's just one of those movies where Van Damme defeats his team (in this case, his double team) and we get to see some adrenalin scenes and we really want the main actor to win. Also, I was expecting to see more fight scenes and less easy kills with guns. You know, body fighting is much more thrilling and more entertaining than just shooting and killing. I remember enjoying his movies when I was younger, but nowadays I prefer a well written story/plot instead of cheap killing spree without a purpose. Anyways, not a bad movie at all, but isn't my type.

    A lot of people call "Indipendence Day" a "masterpiece" or a "good blockbuster". A lot of people call "Double Team" a "crappy movie" or a "plothole fest", since that people claims that "Indipendence Day" is a good movie, why i can't say that Double Team is cool and better than Indipendence Day ? The movie stars Jean Claude Van-Damme (playing the character Jack Quinn), i don't care about your opinion, most of people hate him because of his "bad acting" (seriously, do you care about acting ?), but he have a lot of potential and like in most of his movies, he shows good skills in martial arts. Dennis Rodman (playing the character Yaz), is another actor that everyone hates because of his "bad acting", but i liked his performance as a sidekick. Mickey Rourke (playing the character Stavros), plays the villain, good performance also. Double team is directed by Tsui Hark, a awesome Hong Kong director, i liked Double team as i liked his movies made in Hong Kong. The action scenes are great, we get both martial arts fighting and shootouts. The score is great also, the music in the credits by Crystal Waters (featuring: Dennis Rodman), made me watch it until the credits rolled to the last second. The cheesy CGI effects had their fashion. Also, there is a small surprise in the ending, involving coke vending machines, don't worry i am not going to spoil it. I am not expecting some academy award winner, it's an action movie ! Who care about plot holes ?

    The action-packed, globe-trotting Jean-Claude Van Damme adventure "Double Team" derives its sporty title from the unlikely combo of NBA bad boy Dennis Rodman and Van Damme in pursuit of arch foe Mickey Rourke. "Double Team" might have been drivel at a dribble were it not for the dazzling aplomb with which gifted Hong Kong action helmer Tsui Hark stages a number of snappy, hyperkinetic action sequences. Van Damme stars as Jack Quinn, the best counter-terrorist in the business, who retires and settles down with his wife Kathryn (French television actress Natacha Lindinger) to raise a family. His old bosses lure Jack back into the spy game to ice his oldest foe, Stavros (Mickey Rourke of "Sin City"). At an ambush in Antwerp, everything goes wrong. Quinn nearly dies from an explosion, and the wily Stavros eludes death. When Quinn recovers, he finds himself trapped on an island fortress called the Penal Colony with no hope for escape. The seas around the island are a maze of laser beams. The Colony guardian Goldsmythe (Paul Freeman), explains to Quinn that he is confined to the island for the remainder of his life in the dubious company of the deadliest spies in the world. Not only are they too valuable to terminate, but also that are too lethal to be let loose. According to Goldsmythe, the Penal Colony serves as an espionage think tank. Equipped with the latest high-tech gadgetry, these Penal Colony lifers act as consultants in resolving international disputes. Of course, Quinn devises a stunning escape plan based on split-second timing. Meanwhile, Stavros kidnaps his pregnant wife and sweeps her off to Rome. Stavros has every reason to hat Jack Quinn. Stavros took Quinn's wife as hostage. After he engineers a daring daylight escape, Quinn saves his wife from a ruthless death squad in the Eternal City. Although Kathryn gives birth to a baby boy, Stavros manages to stay a step ahead of Quinn and abducts the newborn. Quinn confronts Stavros in a land mine laden Roman Coliseum and battles a ravenous Bengal tiger. Our hero relieves heavily on the firepower provided by a weird underground CIA arms dealer named Yaz (Dennis Rodman) in both on Stavros. Yaz himself comes along to play against the bad guys in a bullet-scarred finale. Scenarists Don ("Lifeforce") Jakoby and Paul ("The Quest") Mones pull out all stops with an audacious, slam dunk script that resembles a James Bond extravaganza, complete with several exotic settings. Of course, the Jakoby & Mones' screenplay is thoroughly predictable, but these writers know how to tweak the formula with a fresh gag or two. Hong Kong action helmer Hark makes the third Royal Colony refugee that Van Damme has called on to direct his movies. Earlier, Van Damme tapped John Woo to call the shots on "Hard Target, but John Travolta has since wooed Woo to direct "Broken Arrow" and "Face/Off" with Nicolas Cage. In "Maximum Risk," Van Damme imported the services of the skilled Ringo Lam. Unlike both "Hard Target" and "Maximum Risk," "Double Team" takes its far-fetched plot to preposterously outlandish lengths. Hark never lets the supercharged action idle away in this stylist thriller. He enlivens the action sequences with the kind of bravura that make you want to flinch and duck. The fight between Van Damme and as Asian henchman who grips a switchblade between his toes is invigoratingly fresh. And the computerized cyber-monks in the Vatican are a scream. Jean-Claude Van Damme spends more time averting disaster than acting, but nobody watches a JCVD movie to see the star emote. Credit Van Damme with modeling the appropriate expression for each crisis. Mickey Rourke is the thespian to appreciate. His truly cool villain is an anthology of postures. If Paul Freeman, who plays the Penal Colony guardian, appears familiar, you may remember him as the adversary with whom Indiana Jones tangled in "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Meanwhile, Dennis Rodman is not so much an actor as he is a special effect. As Yaz, Rodman pedals a flashy arsenal for Van Damme as well as gives the film some of its lighter moments. When the initially encounter each other, Van Damme looks at Rodman and questions him about who does his hair? Siegfried or Roy? With a ring or a stud on most of his bodily appendages, an array of Yazoo Tattoos and his multicolored turf, Rodman looks as funny as he does lethal. The scene where Rodman steals a car that he has to steer with his head sticking through the sun roof is hilarious. Director Tsui Hark deploys the scene-stealing Rodman at the right moments to offset the straight-faced heroics of Van Damme. The worst thing that you can say about "Double Team" is the shameless product placement scene in the Coliseum. A number of Coke machine keep our heroes from getting cremated by the usual quota of apocalyptic explosions. On the other hand, the scene where scores of Coke cans complicate the heroics of Jean-Claude is good. If you are a JCVD fan, you get to see our protagonist articulate his muscles from Brussels in a couple of well-choreographed combat sequences. If you enjoy watching glossy, superbly lensed action movies, "Double Team" ought to keep you entertained and occupied. The inventive script, the electrifying directing, and the stirring Gary Chang music contribute to the success of "Double Team."

    Jack Quinn is top counter-terrorist, and before his final mission he misses terrorist Stavros. During this epic battle, Quinn is wounded and sent to the Colony, where everyone else presumes he is dead. He is reassured by Belloq from Raiders, and gets fit by smoking cigarettes, and lifting a bath. Stavros had his son killed in the earlier fight and as revenge he is hunting Quinn's pregnant wife. Quinn joins forces with vivid arms dealer Yaz to fight Stavros, and a tiger..... This film, and Knock Off are easily Van Dammes most bizarre movie, but they are nothing short of entertaining. The editing is all over the shop, and the script is undoubtedly awful, but I had so much fun watching this, and still do every time I put it in my machine. Van Damme is as good as always, and Rourke as you would expect. Rodman, well he's in it, and that's all I can say. The fight scenes are awesome, some of the camera-work inspired, and the fact that it's on less than 90 minutes, only adds to the charm. Yes it may have lots and lots of flaws, but it's entertaining, and any film that involves a man kick shoes at Van Damme or the man kick a tiger, has to be seen.

    A logic-free action flick that stretches plausibility way beyond breaking point, Double Team stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as counter-terrorist expert Jack Quinn who, after a botched mission to kill international terrorist Stavros (Mickey Rourke), becomes an unwilling participant in a top secret think-tank on a remote island colony for agents that are considered 'too valuable to kill, but too dangerous to set free'. When Stavros (Mickey Rourke) abducts Jack's pregnant wife, having vowed revenge for the accidental death of his son during the earlier shootout, Jack escapes the colony, seeks help from an S&M freak gun dealer named Yaz (played by eccentric basketball bad-boy Dennis Rodman), and embarks on a dangerous rescue mission that culminates in an explosive showdown inside a coliseum. Opening with Quinn escaping from some bad guys by jumping a heavily armoured stolen vehicle through a speeding train (without the aid of a ramp), this film is completely crazy from the get go, and Hong Kong director Tsui Hark doesn't let the insanity subside until the very end, chucking in such spectacular nonsense as Van Damme kicking the crap out of bad guys while hanging from an air-plane cargo net, a Chinese killer who uses his knife with his foot, a top secret society of cyber-monks, and a finale that sees the good guys fight a tiger in the middle of a mine field before escaping certain death from fireball through the use of a Coke vending machine. Special mention must also be made of the incredible amount of glass that gets smashed during the film (usually because someone has been thrown through it). Although I'll never quite understand how this film got green-lit, I'm sure glad it did: a more enjoyably insane piece of 90s nonsense you'll be hard pushed to find. Call me crazy, but I rate Double Team 8 out of 10 simply for being so bloody silly.

    Jack Quinn(Jean Claude Van Damme, who gets to do plenty of the high kicks that he's famous for) retires from being a counter-terrorist, is brought back(yup, the clich&eacute;s, formulaic nature and stereotypes that drown every line of dialog and every other aspect of the writing in this come in right at the beginning) to take out Stavros(Rourke, who makes for a cool villain and comes off as a genuine match to him, in the realms of fighting and tactics), who used to... uh... well, now he's going to... hm... you know, I have no clue. Anyway, it goes wrong, his son dies in the chaos(this time, it's personal?), and JCVD is sent to The Colony, a secret(somehow...) think-tank comprised of former agents and enemies, leading us to wonder why they don't kill each other(and there literally appears to be no guards there... heck, even if it meant their death, they might be fanatic enough), they can move about though they have to check in at specific times. Along the way he also meets Yaz(...I know all three of those letters, but they don't go together like that), a world-class arms dealer(Rodman, who also gets to take part in the decently choreographed and covered martial arts of which there is a pretty good amount) in aÂ… let's call it a bi-curious nightclub, and they throw in some basketball references(because, and this may surprise you, apparently Dennis dabbled in that field, briefly). He's only in half of it, but he can't act and at times he doesn't seem capable of shutting up(man, does he get to be obnoxious). This is full of over the top action where physics take a back seat, there is excessive use of Dutch angles, and, like Speed, exhausting if you're not in the mood for it. Is it fun? Well, if you leave your brain at the door, and you aren't distracted by really goofy, out of place stuff... like this weird "focus" or sixth sense kind of thing to both the hero and bad guy. And the tigers. This is actually downright hard to follow at points, because of how... dumb it is. There is brief moderate to strong language in this. The DVD comes with a trailer. I recommend this to adrenaline junkies. 5/10

    For those who like movies that involve bombs, shots, broken glasses and lack of reason or reality, this movie will work. It's just one of those movies where Van Damme defeats his team (in this case, his double team) and we get to see some adrenalin scenes and we really want the main actor to win. Also, I was expecting to see more fight scenes and less easy kills with guns. You know, body fighting is much more thrilling and more entertaining than just shooting and killing. I remember enjoying his movies when I was younger, but nowadays I prefer a well written story/plot instead of cheap killing spree without a purpose. Anyways, not a bad movie at all, but isn't my type.

    A lot of people call "Indipendence Day" a "masterpiece" or a "good blockbuster". A lot of people call "Double Team" a "crappy movie" or a "plothole fest", since that people claims that "Indipendence Day" is a good movie, why i can't say that Double Team is cool and better than Indipendence Day ? The movie stars Jean Claude Van-Damme (playing the character Jack Quinn), i don't care about your opinion, most of people hate him because of his "bad acting" (seriously, do you care about acting ?), but he have a lot of potential and like in most of his movies, he shows good skills in martial arts. Dennis Rodman (playing the character Yaz), is another actor that everyone hates because of his "bad acting", but i liked his performance as a sidekick. Mickey Rourke (playing the character Stavros), plays the villain, good performance also. Double team is directed by Tsui Hark, a awesome Hong Kong director, i liked Double team as i liked his movies made in Hong Kong. The action scenes are great, we get both martial arts fighting and shootouts. The score is great also, the music in the credits by Crystal Waters (featuring: Dennis Rodman), made me watch it until the credits rolled to the last second. The cheesy CGI effects had their fashion. Also, there is a small surprise in the ending, involving coke vending machines, don't worry i am not going to spoil it. I am not expecting some academy award winner, it's an action movie ! Who care about plot holes ?

    The action-packed, globe-trotting Jean-Claude Van Damme adventure "Double Team" derives its sporty title from the unlikely combo of NBA bad boy Dennis Rodman and Van Damme in pursuit of arch foe Mickey Rourke. "Double Team" might have been drivel at a dribble were it not for the dazzling aplomb with which gifted Hong Kong action helmer Tsui Hark stages a number of snappy, hyperkinetic action sequences. Van Damme stars as Jack Quinn, the best counter-terrorist in the business, who retires and settles down with his wife Kathryn (French television actress Natacha Lindinger) to raise a family. His old bosses lure Jack back into the spy game to ice his oldest foe, Stavros (Mickey Rourke of "Sin City"). At an ambush in Antwerp, everything goes wrong. Quinn nearly dies from an explosion, and the wily Stavros eludes death. When Quinn recovers, he finds himself trapped on an island fortress called the Penal Colony with no hope for escape. The seas around the island are a maze of laser beams. The Colony guardian Goldsmythe (Paul Freeman), explains to Quinn that he is confined to the island for the remainder of his life in the dubious company of the deadliest spies in the world. Not only are they too valuable to terminate, but also that are too lethal to be let loose. According to Goldsmythe, the Penal Colony serves as an espionage think tank. Equipped with the latest high-tech gadgetry, these Penal Colony lifers act as consultants in resolving international disputes. Of course, Quinn devises a stunning escape plan based on split-second timing. Meanwhile, Stavros kidnaps his pregnant wife and sweeps her off to Rome. Stavros has every reason to hat Jack Quinn. Stavros took Quinn's wife as hostage. After he engineers a daring daylight escape, Quinn saves his wife from a ruthless death squad in the Eternal City. Although Kathryn gives birth to a baby boy, Stavros manages to stay a step ahead of Quinn and abducts the newborn. Quinn confronts Stavros in a land mine laden Roman Coliseum and battles a ravenous Bengal tiger. Our hero relieves heavily on the firepower provided by a weird underground CIA arms dealer named Yaz (Dennis Rodman) in both on Stavros. Yaz himself comes along to play against the bad guys in a bullet-scarred finale. Scenarists Don ("Lifeforce") Jakoby and Paul ("The Quest") Mones pull out all stops with an audacious, slam dunk script that resembles a James Bond extravaganza, complete with several exotic settings. Of course, the Jakoby & Mones' screenplay is thoroughly predictable, but these writers know how to tweak the formula with a fresh gag or two. Hong Kong action helmer Hark makes the third Royal Colony refugee that Van Damme has called on to direct his movies. Earlier, Van Damme tapped John Woo to call the shots on "Hard Target, but John Travolta has since wooed Woo to direct "Broken Arrow" and "Face/Off" with Nicolas Cage. In "Maximum Risk," Van Damme imported the services of the skilled Ringo Lam. Unlike both "Hard Target" and "Maximum Risk," "Double Team" takes its far-fetched plot to preposterously outlandish lengths. Hark never lets the supercharged action idle away in this stylist thriller. He enlivens the action sequences with the kind of bravura that make you want to flinch and duck. The fight between Van Damme and as Asian henchman who grips a switchblade between his toes is invigoratingly fresh. And the computerized cyber-monks in the Vatican are a scream. Jean-Claude Van Damme spends more time averting disaster than acting, but nobody watches a JCVD movie to see the star emote. Credit Van Damme with modeling the appropriate expression for each crisis. Mickey Rourke is the thespian to appreciate. His truly cool villain is an anthology of postures. If Paul Freeman, who plays the Penal Colony guardian, appears familiar, you may remember him as the adversary with whom Indiana Jones tangled in "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Meanwhile, Dennis Rodman is not so much an actor as he is a special effect. As Yaz, Rodman pedals a flashy arsenal for Van Damme as well as gives the film some of its lighter moments. When the initially encounter each other, Van Damme looks at Rodman and questions him about who does his hair? Siegfried or Roy? With a ring or a stud on most of his bodily appendages, an array of Yazoo Tattoos and his multicolored turf, Rodman looks as funny as he does lethal. The scene where Rodman steals a car that he has to steer with his head sticking through the sun roof is hilarious. Director Tsui Hark deploys the scene-stealing Rodman at the right moments to offset the straight-faced heroics of Van Damme. The worst thing that you can say about "Double Team" is the shameless product placement scene in the Coliseum. A number of Coke machine keep our heroes from getting cremated by the usual quota of apocalyptic explosions. On the other hand, the scene where scores of Coke cans complicate the heroics of Jean-Claude is good. If you are a JCVD fan, you get to see our protagonist articulate his muscles from Brussels in a couple of well-choreographed combat sequences. If you enjoy watching glossy, superbly lensed action movies, "Double Team" ought to keep you entertained and occupied. The inventive script, the electrifying directing, and the stirring Gary Chang music contribute to the success of "Double Team."

    courtesy of www.PopBunker.net We've all had it happen. A day will be going merrily along with normal annoyances and accomplishments. Then suddenly, out random chaos, something triggers the memory of an innocent of something so profoundly awful and cringe-inducing that all he wishes is that the memory would have stayed forgotten. Sometimes the buried memory is in the form of an embarrassing moment; like taking out one's junk and swinging it around at a wedding reception. And other times it is bewildering reminders of craptacular movies like Double Team. My day "job" includes managing an online inventory. Recently we obtained around 300 DVDs to add to our online and brick and mortar inventory. Usually I don't pay attention to titles when mindlessly adding to our inventory. But yesterday I was struck as if by a malevolent satorie when this DVD came through. I tweeted about it and got back a few colorful responses with regards to re-opening this wound of a movie in the minds of many. So what was so awful about "Double Team?" Well, first of all the name: Double Team. Everyone is entitled to his most far-fetched fantasy, but I can't imagine anyone Â– not even the most strong stomach celeb stalker Â– wanting to be doubled teamed by JCVD and Dennis Rodman. It would be like having a fantasy involving a threesome with Larry King and Frances Bay (Granda from Happy Gilmore) while everyone wears a KISS mask. It just doesn't compute even to the most perverse of minds. The next thingÂ… wellÂ… Dennis Rodman. I mean just image google his name. Or don't. Be who you wanna be, kid. It's all good. But to be who Rodman is and mix that with the absolute fact that he can act about as well as he shot three-pointers (23.1%) makes a mess recipe for a movie. "Double Team" even had Mickey Rourke when he was an a-hole everyone hated instead of The Wrestler reborn a-hole that everyone suddenly thinks is cool because he is in Iron Man 2. (A side note: Rourke is the ultimate retro-cool has-been a-hole re-made into the suddenly in-demand cool a-hole that soon everyone will remember is an a-hole and will be cast aside once again. It's a crazy business.) The last thing I'm going to point out in "what was so awful aboutÂ…" is that it was a stone cold career killer for JCVD. It may well be that JCVD was going to have a short career arc as a major action player anyway, but in the three years leading up to "Double Team," he was in Timecop (1994), Streetfighter & Sudden Death (1995), The Quest & Maximum Risk (1996). "Double Team" flushed down in 1997 and thenÂ… that was it. I think everything after "Double Team" was a direct-to-DVD or limited release for JCVD. JCVD was not known for quality cinema, but he was known for exploitative movies made for men who love movies made for men. JCVD movies were cheap to make and did enough bank at the box officeÂ… until "Double Team." Not even men who love movies made for men could love JCVD after he was in a movie with Dennis Rodman that, if I remember correctly, featured a fight or chase or something where Rodman's mode of attack was Grabbing a Rebound Kung-fu or some ridiculous junk like that. I know it involved a gratuitously out of place basketball reference somehow. courtesy of www.PopBunker.net

    This is not a very good movie, but pretty good, stylish and enjoyable, so one of Van Damme's bests. I don't see Jean Claude Van Damme as a bad actor, may be because I like him, he was one of my childhood heroes. It seems that he did what people wanted from him. Some say that he is hopelessly untalented, but he has a pulling power, hasn't he? Otherwise, now there would not have been a lot of Van Damme fans, even if they have lessened day after day. I watched almost all his films except his first movie and a few of his recent movies and to me Double Team is from his golden period. By the way, I learned that Tsui Hark hates John Woo's The Killer. If you ask me, he is absolutely right. Because according to many people The Killer is a great action film, but to it was extremely slow paced except the final part and not stylish. Probably, like me, Hark had sat down to watch an action movie, but it was not. Double Team is non stop action. In comparison with some recent soap bubble and very slow paced action movies like The Sentinel or The Shooter, Double Team is not only very fast paced, but also pretty stylish. However, the most odd thing is that even the ratings of the awful movies of Van Damme such as Second in Command, Wake of Death, In Hell, The Order or Inferno are higher than Double Team. ??? The whole movie is fun owing to Hark, Van Damme and Rodman who adds color to the movie. Watching Rourke who brings a pessimistic tone to the movie is also interesting. The operation in the funfair part consists of very stylish action scenes. This colorful part is one of the best parts of the movie. As you know, all of the early Van Damme films include training scenes, they are famous for those scenes, too (to me) In Double Team, there is a training scene too. The only flawed point comes in the end, the end was unrealistic with bad CGI. And the images I have not forgotten since 1997. The face of Van Damme in the end of the hospital scene, the face of Mickey Rourke in the stadium, finger scene and Rodman's question: ''Did you open it?''

    For those who like movies that involve bombs, shots, broken glasses and lack of reason or reality, this movie will work. It's just one of those movies where Van Damme defeats his team (in this case, his double team) and we get to see some adrenalin scenes and we really want the main actor to win. Also, I was expecting to see more fight scenes and less easy kills with guns. You know, body fighting is much more thrilling and more entertaining than just shooting and killing. I remember enjoying his movies when I was younger, but nowadays I prefer a well written story/plot instead of cheap killing spree without a purpose. Anyways, not a bad movie at all, but isn't my type.

    A lot of people call "Indipendence Day" a "masterpiece" or a "good blockbuster". A lot of people call "Double Team" a "crappy movie" or a "plothole fest", since that people claims that "Indipendence Day" is a good movie, why i can't say that Double Team is cool and better than Indipendence Day ? The movie stars Jean Claude Van-Damme (playing the character Jack Quinn), i don't care about your opinion, most of people hate him because of his "bad acting" (seriously, do you care about acting ?), but he have a lot of potential and like in most of his movies, he shows good skills in martial arts. Dennis Rodman (playing the character Yaz), is another actor that everyone hates because of his "bad acting", but i liked his performance as a sidekick. Mickey Rourke (playing the character Stavros), plays the villain, good performance also. Double team is directed by Tsui Hark, a awesome Hong Kong director, i liked Double team as i liked his movies made in Hong Kong. The action scenes are great, we get both martial arts fighting and shootouts. The score is great also, the music in the credits by Crystal Waters (featuring: Dennis Rodman), made me watch it until the credits rolled to the last second. The cheesy CGI effects had their fashion. Also, there is a small surprise in the ending, involving coke vending machines, don't worry i am not going to spoil it. I am not expecting some academy award winner, it's an action movie !

    The action-packed, globe-trotting Jean-Claude Van Damme adventure "Double Team" derives its sporty title from the unlikely combo of NBA bad boy Dennis Rodman and Van Damme in pursuit of arch foe Mickey Rourke. "Double Team" might have been drivel at a dribble were it not for the dazzling aplomb with which gifted Hong Kong action helmer Tsui Hark stages a number of snappy, hyperkinetic action sequences. Van Damme stars as Jack Quinn, the best counter-terrorist in the business, who retires and settles down with his wife Kathryn (French television actress Natacha Lindinger) to raise a family. His old bosses lure Jack back into the spy game to ice his oldest foe, Stavros (Mickey Rourke of "Sin City"). At an ambush in Antwerp, everything goes wrong. Quinn nearly dies from an explosion, and the wily Stavros eludes death. When Quinn recovers, he finds himself trapped on an island fortress called the Penal Colony with no hope for escape. The seas around the island are a maze of laser beams. The Colony guardian Goldsmythe (Paul Freeman), explains to Quinn that he is confined to the island for the remainder of his life in the dubious company of the deadliest spies in the world. Not only are they too valuable to terminate, but also that are too lethal to be let loose. According to Goldsmythe, the Penal Colony serves as an espionage think tank. Equipped with the latest high-tech gadgetry, these Penal Colony lifers act as consultants in resolving international disputes. Of course, Quinn devises a stunning escape plan based on split-second timing. Meanwhile, Stavros kidnaps his pregnant wife and sweeps her off to Rome. Stavros has every reason to hat Jack Quinn. Stavros took Quinn's wife as hostage. After he engineers a daring daylight escape, Quinn saves his wife from a ruthless death squad in the Eternal City. Although Kathryn gives birth to a baby boy, Stavros manages to stay a step ahead of Quinn and abducts the newborn. Quinn confronts Stavros in a land mine laden Roman Coliseum and battles a ravenous Bengal tiger. Our hero relieves heavily on the firepower provided by a weird underground CIA arms dealer named Yaz (Dennis Rodman) in both on Stavros. Yaz himself comes along to play against the bad guys in a bullet-scarred finale. Scenarists Don ("Lifeforce") Jakoby and Paul ("The Quest") Mones pull out all stops with an audacious, slam dunk script that resembles a James Bond extravaganza, complete with several exotic settings. Of course, the Jakoby & Mones' screenplay is thoroughly predictable, but these writers know how to tweak the formula with a fresh gag or two. Hong Kong action helmer Hark makes the third Royal Colony refugee that Van Damme has called on to direct his movies. Earlier, Van Damme tapped John Woo to call the shots on "Hard Target, but John Travolta has since wooed Woo to direct "Broken Arrow" and "Face/Off" with Nicolas Cage. In "Maximum Risk," Van Damme imported the services of the skilled Ringo Lam. Unlike both "Hard Target" and "Maximum Risk," "Double Team" takes its far-fetched plot to preposterously outlandish lengths. Hark never lets the supercharged action idle away in this stylist thriller. He enlivens the action sequences with the kind of bravura that make you want to flinch and duck. The fight between Van Damme and as Asian henchman who grips a switchblade between his toes is invigoratingly fresh. And the computerized cyber-monks in the Vatican are a scream. Jean-Claude Van Damme spends more time averting disaster than acting, but nobody watches a JCVD movie to see the star emote. Credit Van Damme with modeling the appropriate expression for each crisis. Mickey Rourke is the thespian to appreciate. His truly cool villain is an anthology of postures. If Paul Freeman, who plays the Penal Colony guardian, appears familiar, you may remember him as the adversary with whom Indiana Jones tangled in "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Meanwhile, Dennis Rodman is not so much an actor as he is a special effect. As Yaz, Rodman pedals a flashy arsenal for Van Damme as well as gives the film some of its lighter moments. When the initially encounter each other, Van Damme looks at Rodman and questions him about who does his hair? Siegfried or Roy? With a ring or a stud on most of his bodily appendages, an array of Yazoo Tattoos and his multicolored turf, Rodman looks as funny as he does lethal. The scene where Rodman steals a car that he has to steer with his head sticking through the sun roof is hilarious. Director Tsui Hark deploys the scene-stealing Rodman at the right moments to offset the straight-faced heroics of Van Damme. The worst thing that you can say about "Double Team" is the shameless product placement scene in the Coliseum. A number of Coke machine keep our heroes from getting cremated by the usual quota of apocalyptic explosions. On the other hand, the scene where scores of Coke cans complicate the heroics of Jean-Claude is good. If you are a JCVD fan, you get to see our protagonist articulate his muscles from Brussels in a couple of well-choreographed combat sequences. If you enjoy watching glossy, superbly lensed action movies, "Double Team" ought to keep you entertained and occupied. The inventive script, the electrifying directing, and the stirring Gary Chang music contribute to the success of "Double Team."

    courtesy of www.PopBunker.net We've all had it happen. A day will be going merrily along with normal annoyances and accomplishments. Then suddenly, out random chaos, something triggers the memory of an innocent of something so profoundly awful and cringe-inducing that all he wishes is that the memory would have stayed forgotten. Sometimes the buried memory is in the form of an embarrassing moment; like taking out one's junk and swinging it around at a wedding reception. And other times it is bewildering reminders of craptacular movies like Double Team. My day "job" includes managing an online inventory. Recently we obtained around 300 DVDs to add to our online and brick and mortar inventory. Usually I don't pay attention to titles when mindlessly adding to our inventory. But yesterday I was struck as if by a malevolent satorie when this DVD came through. I tweeted about it and got back a few colorful responses with regards to re-opening this wound of a movie in the minds of many. So what was so awful about "Double Team?" Well, first of all the name: Double Team. Everyone is entitled to his most far-fetched fantasy, but I can't imagine anyone Â– not even the most strong stomach celeb stalker Â– wanting to be doubled teamed by JCVD and Dennis Rodman. It would be like having a fantasy involving a threesome with Larry King and Frances Bay (Granda from Happy Gilmore) while everyone wears a KISS mask. It just doesn't compute even to the most perverse of minds. The next thingÂ… wellÂ… Dennis Rodman. I mean just image google his name. Or don't. Be who you wanna be, kid. It's all good. But to be who Rodman is and mix that with the absolute fact that he can act about as well as he shot three-pointers (23.1%) makes a mess recipe for a movie. "Double Team" even had Mickey Rourke when he was an a-hole everyone hated instead of The Wrestler reborn a-hole that everyone suddenly thinks is cool because he is in Iron Man 2. (A side note: Rourke is the ultimate retro-cool has-been a-hole re-made into the suddenly in-demand cool a-hole that soon everyone will remember is an a-hole and will be cast aside once again. It's a crazy business.) The last thing I'm going to point out in "what was so awful aboutÂ…" is that it was a stone cold career killer for JCVD. It may well be that JCVD was going to have a short career arc as a major action player anyway, but in the three years leading up to "Double Team," he was in Timecop (1994), Streetfighter & Sudden Death (1995), The Quest & Maximum Risk (1996). "Double Team" flushed down in 1997 and thenÂ… that was it. I think everything after "Double Team" was a direct-to-DVD or limited release for JCVD. JCVD was not known for quality cinema, but he was known for exploitative movies made for men who love movies made for men. JCVD movies were cheap to make and did enough bank at the box officeÂ… until "Double Team." Not even men who love movies made for men could love JCVD after he was in a movie with Dennis Rodman that, if I remember correctly, featured a fight or chase or something where Rodman's mode of attack was Grabbing a Rebound Kung-fu or some ridiculous junk like that. I know it involved a gratuitously out of place basketball reference somehow. courtesy of www.PopBunker.net

    This is not a very good movie, but pretty good, stylish and enjoyable, so one of Van Damme's bests. I don't see Jean Claude Van Damme as a bad actor, may be because I like him, he was one of my childhood heroes. It seems that he did what people wanted from him. Some say that he is hopelessly untalented, but he has a pulling power, hasn't he? Otherwise, now there would not have been a lot of Van Damme fans, even if they have lessened day after day. I watched almost all his films except his first movie and a few of his recent movies and to me Double Team is from his golden period. By the way, I learned that Tsui Hark hates John Woo's The Killer. If you ask me, he is absolutely right. Because according to many people The Killer is a great action film, but to it was extremely slow paced except the final part and not stylish. Probably, like me, Hark had sat down to watch an action movie, but it was not. Double Team is non stop action. In comparison with some recent soap bubble and very slow paced action movies like The Sentinel or The Shooter, Double Team is not only very fast paced, but also pretty stylish. However, the most odd thing is that even the ratings of the awful movies of Van Damme such as Second in Command, Wake of Death, In Hell, The Order or Inferno are higher than Double Team. ??? The whole movie is fun owing to Hark, Van Damme and Rodman who adds color to the movie. Watching Rourke who brings a pessimistic tone to the movie is also interesting. The operation in the funfair part consists of very stylish action scenes. This colorful part is one of the best parts of the movie. As you know, all of the early Van Damme films include training scenes, they are famous for those scenes, too (to me) In Double Team, there is a training scene too. The only flawed point comes in the end, the end was unrealistic with bad CGI. And the images I have not forgotten since 1997. The face of Van Damme in the end of the hospital scene, the face of Mickey Rourke in the stadium, finger scene and Rodman's question: ''Did you open it?''

    i can see why people hate this movie so bad i know it's a bit silly and i am Big Fan Of Jean Claude Van Damme and Mickey Rourke and Dennis Rodman was Awesome and Funny but not much as Action Star didn't do much of Movies and in this movie was pretty awesome seeing Van Damme fighting with Rourke and movie wasn't that bad come on if your fan van Damme fan you should enjoy this movie it's fun Movie i don't care what people say and the opening scene when van damme driving the big truck in opening scene was cool and part in of Dennis was funny but they could of got Wesley Snipes rather then Dennis Rodman but it doesn't matter it's still good idea for me and Quinn escapes from the colony and goes after Stavroes for revenge. Quinn is helped by Yaz Dennis Rodman Double Team they helping each another in mission to get his wife and baby and fight scenes with Van and Mickey was Awesome but i know Mickey Rourke doesn't like van Damme with some reason i don't know about but the fight scenes was fun didn't go for that long but you don't need to see long as showdown when van Damme fights were amazing like in Bloodsport if you enjoy Hard Target and Double Impact and Knock off and Kickboxer and Bloodsport this is fun movie that you will Enjoy for Van Damme Fans like this only 4.4 i will give this 7.10

    Jack Quinn is top counter-terrorist, and before his final mission he misses terrorist Stavros. During this epic battle, Quinn is wounded and sent to the Colony, where everyone else presumes he is dead. He is reassured by Belloq from Raiders, and gets fit by smoking cigarettes, and lifting a bath. Stavros had his son killed in the earlier fight and as revenge he is hunting Quinn's pregnant wife. Quinn joins forces with vivid arms dealer Yaz to fight Stavros, and a tiger..... This film, and Knock Off are easily Van Dammes most bizarre movie, but they are nothing short of entertaining. The editing is all over the shop, and the script is undoubtedly awful, but I had so much fun watching this, and still do every time I put it in my machine. Van Damme is as good as always, and Rourke as you would expect. Rodman, well he's in it, and that's all I can say. The fight scenes are awesome, some of the camera-work inspired, and the fact that it's on less than 90 minutes, only adds to the charm. Yes it may have lots and lots of flaws, but it's entertaining, and any film that involves a man kick shoes at Van Damme or the man kick a tiger, has to be seen.

    A logic-free action flick that stretches plausibility way beyond breaking point, Double Team stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as counter-terrorist expert Jack Quinn who, after a botched mission to kill international terrorist Stavros (Mickey Rourke), becomes an unwilling participant in a top secret think-tank on a remote island colony for agents that are considered 'too valuable to kill, but too dangerous to set free'. When Stavros (Mickey Rourke) abducts Jack's pregnant wife, having vowed revenge for the accidental death of his son during the earlier shootout, Jack escapes the colony, seeks help from an S&M freak gun dealer named Yaz (played by eccentric basketball bad-boy Dennis Rodman), and embarks on a dangerous rescue mission that culminates in an explosive showdown inside a coliseum. Opening with Quinn escaping from some bad guys by jumping a heavily armoured stolen vehicle through a speeding train (without the aid of a ramp), this film is completely crazy from the get go, and Hong Kong director Tsui Hark doesn't let the insanity subside until the very end, chucking in such spectacular nonsense as Van Damme kicking the crap out of bad guys while hanging from an air-plane cargo net, a Chinese killer who uses his knife with his foot, a top secret society of cyber-monks, and a finale that sees the good guys fight a tiger in the middle of a mine field before escaping certain death from fireball through the use of a Coke vending machine. Special mention must also be made of the incredible amount of glass that gets smashed during the film (usually because someone has been thrown through it). Although I'll never quite understand how this film got green-lit, I'm sure glad it did: a more enjoyably insane piece of 90s nonsense you'll be hard pushed to find. Call me crazy, but I rate Double Team 8 out of 10 simply for being so bloody silly.

    i can totally understand why some van damme fans don't like this movie, i mean apart from the cast, and the story, its a hong kong action movie, and anybody who knows anything about action cinema, know they are the kings of it. tsu hark is a brilliant director 'once upon a time in china', but i didn't think much of his other van damme collaboration 'knock off'. but gladly this movie is a lot better, and offers some top notch action, and fight scenes. sure dennis rodman looks out of place, but any movie with a smackdown vs van damme and micky rourke cant be anything but great. now a lot of the bad reviews commented on how far fetched it is, and believe me it is, but arnt most hong kong films. never the less i think its a brilliant action movie and one of van damme's best movies of the 90's i recommend

    Jack Quinn(Jean Claude Van Damme, who gets to do plenty of the high kicks that he's famous for) retires from being a counter-terrorist, is brought back(yup, the clich&eacute;s, formulaic nature and stereotypes that drown every line of dialog and every other aspect of the writing in this come in right at the beginning) to take out Stavros(Rourke, who makes for a cool villain and comes off as a genuine match to him, in the realms of fighting and tactics), who used to... uh... well, now he's going to... hm... you know, I have no clue. Anyway, it goes wrong, his son dies in the chaos(this time, it's personal?), and JCVD is sent to The Colony, a secret(somehow...) think-tank comprised of former agents and enemies, leading us to wonder why they don't kill each other(and there literally appears to be no guards there... heck, even if it meant their death, they might be fanatic enough), they can move about though they have to check in at specific times. Along the way he also meets Yaz(...I know all three of those letters, but they don't go together like that), a world-class arms dealer(Rodman, who also gets to take part in the decently choreographed and covered martial arts of which there is a pretty good amount) in aÂ… let's call it a bi-curious nightclub, and they throw in some basketball references(because, and this may surprise you, apparently Dennis dabbled in that field, briefly). He's only in half of it, but he can't act and at times he doesn't seem capable of shutting up(man, does he get to be obnoxious). This is full of over the top action where physics take a back seat, there is excessive use of Dutch angles, and, like Speed, exhausting if you're not in the mood for it. Is it fun? Well, if you leave your brain at the door, and you aren't distracted by really goofy, out of place stuff... like this weird "focus" or sixth sense kind of thing to both the hero and bad guy. And the tigers. This is actually downright hard to follow at points, because of how... dumb it is. There is brief moderate to strong language in this. The DVD comes with a trailer. I recommend this to adrenaline junkies. 5/10

I tweeted about it and got back a few colorful responses with regards to re-opening this wound of a movie in the minds of many. So what was so awful about "Double Team?" Well, first of all the name: Double Team. Everyone is entitled to his most far-fetched fantasy, but I can't imagine anyone Â– not even the most strong stomach celeb stalker Â– wanting to be doubled teamed by JCVD and Dennis Rodman. It would be like having a fantasy involving a threesome with Larry King and Frances Bay (Granda from Happy Gilmore) while everyone wears a KISS mask. It just doesn't compute even to the most perverse of minds. The next thingÂ… wellÂ… Dennis Rodman. I mean just image google his name. Or don't. Be who you wanna be, kid. It's all good. But to be who Rodman is and mix that with the absolute fact that he can act about as well as he shot three-pointers (23.1%) makes a mess recipe for a movie. "Double Team" even had Mickey Rourke when he was an a-hole everyone hated instead of The Wrestler reborn a-hole that everyone suddenly thinks is cool because he is in Iron Man 2. (A side note: Rourke is the ultimate retro-cool has-been a-hole re-made into the suddenly in-demand cool a-hole that soon everyone will remember is an a-hole and will be cast aside once again. It's a crazy business.) The last thing I'm going to point out in "what was so awful aboutÂ…" is that it was a stone cold career killer for JCVD. It may well be that JCVD was going to have a short career arc as a major action player anyway, but in the three years leading up to "Double Team," he was in Timecop (1994), Streetfighter & Sudden Death (1995), The Quest & Maximum Risk (1996). "Double Team" flushed down in 1997 and thenÂ… that was it. I think everything after "Double Team" was a direct-to-DVD or limited release for JCVD. JCVD was not known for quality cinema, but he was known for exploitative movies made for men who love movies made for men. JCVD movies were cheap to make and did enough bank at the box officeÂ… until "Double Team." Not even men who love movies made for men could love JCVD after he was in a movie with Dennis Rodman that, if I remember correctly, featured a fight or chase or something where Rodman's mode of attack was Grabbing a Rebound Kung-fu or some ridiculous junk like that. I know it involved a gratuitously out of place basketball reference somehow. courtesy of www.PopBunker.net

    This is not a very good movie, but pretty good, stylish and enjoyable, so one of Van Damme's bests. I don't see Jean Claude Van Damme as a bad actor, may be because I like him, he was one of my childhood heroes. It seems that he did what people wanted from him. Some say that he is hopelessly untalented, but he has a pulling power, hasn't he? Otherwise, now there would not have been a lot of Van Damme fans, even if they have lessened day after day. I watched almost all his films except his first movie and a few of his recent movies and to me Double Team is from his golden period. By the way, I learned that Tsui Hark hates John Woo's The Killer. If you ask me, he is absolutely right. Because according to many people The Killer is a great action film, but to it was extremely slow paced except the final part and not stylish. Probably, like me, Hark had sat down to watch an action movie, but it was not. Double Team is non stop action. In comparison with some recent soap bubble and very slow paced action movies like The Sentinel or The Shooter, Double Team is not only very fast paced, but also pretty stylish. However, the most odd thing is that even the ratings of the awful movies of Van Damme such as Second in Command, Wake of Death, In Hell, The Order or Inferno are higher than Double Team. ??? The whole movie is fun owing to Hark, Van Damme and Rodman who adds color to the movie. Watching Rourke who brings a pessimistic tone to the movie is also interesting. The operation in the funfair part consists of very stylish action scenes. This colorful part is one of the best parts of the movie. As you know, all of the early Van Damme films include training scenes, they are famous for those scenes, too (to me) In Double Team, there is a training scene too. The only flawed point comes in the end, the end was unrealistic with bad CGI. And the images I have not forgotten since 1997. The face of Van Damme in the end of the hospital scene, the face of Mickey Rourke in the stadium, finger scene and Rodman's question: ''Did you open it?''

    Jack Quinn is top counter-terrorist, and before his final mission he misses terrorist Stavros. During this epic battle, Quinn is wounded and sent to the Colony, where everyone else presumes he is dead. He is reassured by Belloq from Raiders, and gets fit by smoking cigarettes, and lifting a bath. Stavros had his son killed in the earlier fight and as revenge he is hunting Quinn's pregnant wife. Quinn joins forces with vivid arms dealer Yaz to fight Stavros, and a tiger..... This film, and Knock Off are easily Van Dammes most bizarre movie, but they are nothing short of entertaining. The editing is all over the shop, and the script is undoubtedly awful, but I had so much fun watching this, and still do every time I put it in my machine. Van Damme is as good as always, and Rourke as you would expect. Rodman, well he's in it, and that's all I can say. The fight scenes are awesome, some of the camera-work inspired, and the fact that it's on less than 90 minutes, only adds to the charm. Yes it may have lots and lots of flaws, but it's entertaining, and any film that involves a man kick shoes at Van Damme or the man kick a tiger, has to be seen.

    A logic-free action flick that stretches plausibility way beyond breaking point, Double Team stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as counter-terrorist expert Jack Quinn who, after a botched mission to kill international terrorist Stavros (Mickey Rourke), becomes an unwilling participant in a top secret think-tank on a remote island colony for agents that are considered 'too valuable to kill, but too dangerous to set free'. When Stavros (Mickey Rourke) abducts Jack's pregnant wife, having vowed revenge for the accidental death of his son during the earlier shootout, Jack escapes the colony, seeks help from an S&M freak gun dealer named Yaz (played by eccentric basketball bad-boy Dennis Rodman), and embarks on a dangerous rescue mission that culminates in an explosive showdown inside a coliseum. Opening with Quinn escaping from some bad guys by jumping a heavily armoured stolen vehicle through a speeding train (without the aid of a ramp), this film is completely crazy from the get go, and Hong Kong director Tsui Hark doesn't let the insanity subside until the very end, chucking in such spectacular nonsense as Van Damme kicking the crap out of bad guys while hanging from an air-plane cargo net, a Chinese killer who uses his knife with his foot, a top secret society of cyber-monks, and a finale that sees the good guys fight a tiger in the middle of a mine field before escaping certain death from fireball through the use of a Coke vending machine. Special mention must also be made of the incredible amount of glass that gets smashed during the film (usually because someone has been thrown through it). Although I'll never quite understand how this film got green-lit, I'm sure glad it did: a more enjoyably insane piece of 90s nonsense you'll be hard pushed to find. Call me crazy, but I rate Double Team 8 out of 10 simply for being so bloody silly.

    i can totally understand why some van damme fans don't like this movie, i mean apart from the cast, and the story, its a hong kong action movie, and anybody who knows anything about action cinema, know they are the kings of it. tsu hark is a brilliant director 'once upon a time in china', but i didn't think much of his other van damme collaboration 'knock off'. but gladly this movie is a lot better, and offers some top notch action, and fight scenes. sure dennis rodman looks out of place, but any movie with a smackdown vs van damme and micky rourke cant be anything but great. now a lot of the bad reviews commented on how far fetched it is, and believe me it is, but arnt most hong kong films. never the less i think its a brilliant action movie and one of van damme's best movies of the 90's i recommend

    Jack Quinn(Jean Claude Van Damme, who gets to do plenty of the high kicks that he's famous for) retires from being a counter-terrorist, is brought back(yup, the clich&eacute;s, formulaic nature and stereotypes that drown every line of dialog and every other aspect of the writing in this come in right at the beginning) to take out Stavros(Rourke, who makes for a cool villain and comes off as a genuine match to him, in the realms of fighting and tactics), who used to... uh... well, now he's going to... hm... you know, I have no clue. Anyway, it goes wrong, his son dies in the chaos(this time, it's personal?), and JCVD is sent to The Colony, a secret(somehow...) think-tank comprised of former agents and enemies, leading us to wonder why they don't kill each other(and there literally appears to be no guards there... heck, even if it meant their death, they might be fanatic enough), they can move about though they have to check in at specific times. Along the way he also meets Yaz(...I know all three of those letters, but they don't go together like that), a world-class arms dealer(Rodman, who also gets to take part in the decently choreographed and covered martial arts of which there is a pretty good amount) in aÂ… let's call it a bi-curious nightclub, and they throw in some basketball references(because, and this may surprise you, apparently Dennis dabbled in that field, briefly). He's only in half of it, but he can't act and at times he doesn't seem capable of shutting up(man, does he get to be obnoxious). This is full of over the top action where physics take a back seat, there is excessive use of Dutch angles, and, like Speed, exhausting if you're not in the mood for it. Is it fun? Well, if you leave your brain at the door, and you aren't distracted by really goofy, out of place stuff... like this weird "focus" or sixth sense kind of thing to both the hero and bad guy. And the tigers. This is actually downright hard to follow at points, because of how... dumb it is. There is brief moderate to strong language in this. The DVD comes with a trailer. I recommend this to adrenaline junkies. 5/10

    For those who like movies that involve bombs, shots, broken glasses and lack of reason or reality, this movie will work. It's just one of those movies where Van Damme defeats his team (in this case, his double team) and we get to see some adrenalin scenes and we really want the main actor to win. Also, I was expecting to see more fight scenes and less easy kills with guns. You know, body fighting is much more thrilling and more entertaining than just shooting and killing. I remember enjoying his movies when I was younger, but nowadays I prefer a well written story/plot instead of cheap killing spree without a purpose. Anyways, not a bad movie at all, but isn't my type.

    A lot of people call "Indipendence Day" a "masterpiece" or a "good blockbuster". A lot of people call "Double Team" a "crappy movie" or a "plothole fest", since that people claims that "Indipendence Day" is a good movie, why i can't say that Double Team is cool and better than Indipendence Day ? The movie stars Jean Claude Van-Damme (playing the character Jack Quinn), i don't care about your opinion, most of people hate him because of his "bad acting" (seriously, do you care about acting ?), but he have a lot of potential and like in most of his movies, he shows good skills in martial arts. Dennis Rodman (playing the character Yaz), is another actor that everyone hates because of his "bad acting", but i liked his performance as a sidekick. Mickey Rourke (playing the character Stavros), plays the villain, good performance also. Double team is directed by Tsui Hark, a awesome Hong Kong director, i liked Double team as i liked his movies made in Hong Kong. The action scenes are great, we get both martial arts fighting and shootouts. The score is great also, the music in the credits by Crystal Waters (featuring: Dennis Rodman), made me watch it until the credits rolled to the last second. The cheesy CGI effects had their fashion. Also, there is a small surprise in the ending, involving coke vending machines, don't worry i am not going to spoil it. I am not expecting some academy award winner, it's an action movie ! Who care about plot holes ?

    The action-packed, globe-trotting Jean-Claude Van Damme adventure "Double Team" derives its sporty title from the unlikely combo of NBA bad boy Dennis Rodman and Van Damme in pursuit of arch foe Mickey Rourke. "Double Team" might have been drivel at a dribble were it not for the dazzling aplomb with which gifted Hong Kong action helmer Tsui Hark stages a number of snappy, hyperkinetic action sequences. Van Damme stars as Jack Quinn, the best counter-terrorist in the business, who retires and settles down with his wife Kathryn (French television actress Natacha Lindinger) to raise a family. His old bosses lure Jack back into the spy game to ice his oldest foe, Stavros (Mickey Rourke of "Sin City"). At an ambush in Antwerp, everything goes wrong. Quinn nearly dies from an explosion, and the wily Stavros eludes death. When Quinn recovers, he finds himself trapped on an island fortress called the Penal Colony with no hope for escape. The seas around the island are a maze of laser beams. The Colony guardian Goldsmythe (Paul Freeman), explains to Quinn that he is confined to the island for the remainder of his life in the dubious company of the deadliest spies in the world. Not only are they too valuable to terminate, but also that are too lethal to be let loose. According to Goldsmythe, the Penal Colony serves as an espionage think tank. Equipped with the latest high-tech gadgetry, these Penal Colony lifers act as consultants in resolving international disputes. Of course, Quinn devises a stunning escape plan based on split-second timing. Meanwhile, Stavros kidnaps his pregnant wife and sweeps her off to Rome. Stavros has every reason to hat Jack Quinn. Stavros took Quinn's wife as hostage. After he engineers a daring daylight escape, Quinn saves his wife from a ruthless death squad in the Eternal City. Although Kathryn gives birth to a baby boy, Stavros manages to stay a step ahead of Quinn and abducts the newborn. Quinn confronts Stavros in a land mine laden Roman Coliseum and battles a ravenous Bengal tiger. Our hero relieves heavily on the firepower provided by a weird underground CIA arms dealer named Yaz (Dennis Rodman) in both on Stavros. Yaz himself comes along to play against the bad guys in a bullet-scarred finale. Scenarists Don ("Lifeforce") Jakoby and Paul ("The Quest") Mones pull out all stops with an audacious, slam dunk script that resembles a James Bond extravaganza, complete with several exotic settings. Of course, the Jakoby & Mones' screenplay is thoroughly predictable, but these writers know how to tweak the formula with a fresh gag or two. Hong Kong action helmer Hark makes the third Royal Colony refugee that Van Damme has called on to direct his movies. Earlier, Van Damme tapped John Woo to call the shots on "Hard Target, but John Travolta has since wooed Woo to direct "Broken Arrow" and "Face/Off" with Nicolas Cage. In "Maximum Risk," Van Damme imported the services of the skilled Ringo Lam. Unlike both "Hard Target" and "Maximum Risk," "Double Team" takes its far-fetched plot to preposterously outlandish lengths. Hark never lets the supercharged action idle away in this stylist thriller. He enlivens the action sequences with the kind of bravura that make you want to flinch and duck. The fight between Van Damme and as Asian henchman who grips a switchblade between his toes is invigoratingly fresh. And the computerized cyber-monks in the Vatican are a scream. Jean-Claude Van Damme spends more time averting disaster than acting, but nobody watches a JCVD movie to see the star emote. Credit Van Damme with modeling the appropriate expression for each crisis. Mickey Rourke is the thespian to appreciate. His truly cool villain is an anthology of postures. If Paul Freeman, who plays the Penal Colony guardian, appears familiar, you may remember him as the adversary with whom Indiana Jones tangled in "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Meanwhile, Dennis Rodman is not so much an actor as he is a special effect. As Yaz, Rodman pedals a flashy arsenal for Van Damme as well as gives the film some of its lighter moments. When the initially encounter each other, Van Damme looks at Rodman and questions him about who does his hair? Siegfried or Roy? With a ring or a stud on most of his bodily appendages, an array of Yazoo Tattoos and his multicolored turf, Rodman looks as funny as he does lethal. The scene where Rodman steals a car that he has to steer with his head sticking through the sun roof is hilarious. Director Tsui Hark deploys the scene-stealing Rodman at the right moments to offset the straight-faced heroics of Van Damme. The worst thing that you can say about "Double Team" is the shameless product placement scene in the Coliseum. A number of Coke machine keep our heroes from getting cremated by the usual quota of apocalyptic explosions. On the other hand, the scene where scores of Coke cans complicate the heroics of Jean-Claude is good. If you are a JCVD fan, you get to see our protagonist articulate his muscles from Brussels in a couple of well-choreographed combat sequences. If you enjoy watching glossy, superbly lensed action movies, "Double Team" ought to keep you entertained and occupied. The inventive script, the electrifying directing, and the stirring Gary Chang music contribute to the success of "Double Team."

    courtesy of www.PopBunker.net We've all had it happen. A day will be going merrily along with normal annoyances and accomplishments. Then suddenly, out random chaos, something triggers the memory of an innocent of something so profoundly awful and cringe-inducing that all he wishes is that the memory would have stayed forgotten. Sometimes the buried memory is in the form of an embarrassing moment; like taking out one's junk and swinging it around at a wedding reception. And other times it is bewildering reminders of craptacular movies like Double Team. My day "job" includes managing an online inventory. Recently we obtained around 300 DVDs to add to our online and brick and mortar inventory. Usually I don't pay attention to titles when mindlessly adding to our inventory. But yesterday I was struck as if by a malevolent satorie when this DVD came through.

    A logic-free action flick that stretches plausibility way beyond breaking point, Double Team stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as counter-terrorist expert Jack Quinn who, after a botched mission to kill international terrorist Stavros (Mickey Rourke), becomes an unwilling participant in a top secret think-tank on a remote island colony for agents that are considered 'too valuable to kill, but too dangerous to set free'. When Stavros (Mickey Rourke) abducts Jack's pregnant wife, having vowed revenge for the accidental death of his son during the earlier shootout, Jack escapes the colony, seeks help from an S&M freak gun dealer named Yaz (played by eccentric basketball bad-boy Dennis Rodman), and embarks on a dangerous rescue mission that culminates in an explosive showdown inside a coliseum. Opening with Quinn escaping from some bad guys by jumping a heavily armoured stolen vehicle through a speeding train (without the aid of a ramp), this film is completely crazy from the get go, and Hong Kong director Tsui Hark doesn't let the insanity subside until the very end, chucking in such spectacular nonsense as Van Damme kicking the crap out of bad guys while hanging from an air-plane cargo net, a Chinese killer who uses his knife with his foot, a top secret society of cyber-monks, and a finale that sees the good guys fight a tiger in the middle of a mine field before escaping certain death from fireball through the use of a Coke vending machine. Special mention must also be made of the incredible amount of glass that gets smashed during the film (usually because someone has been thrown through it). Although I'll never quite understand how this film got green-lit, I'm sure glad it did: a more enjoyably insane piece of 90s nonsense you'll be hard pushed to find. Call me crazy, but I rate Double Team 8 out of 10 simply for being so bloody silly.

    i can totally understand why some van damme fans don't like this movie, i mean apart from the cast, and the story, its a hong kong action movie, and anybody who knows anything about action cinema, know they are the kings of it. tsu hark is a brilliant director 'once upon a time in china', but i didn't think much of his other van damme collaboration 'knock off'. but gladly this movie is a lot better, and offers some top notch action, and fight scenes. sure dennis rodman looks out of place, but any movie with a smackdown vs van damme and micky rourke cant be anything but great. now a lot of the bad reviews commented on how far fetched it is, and believe me it is, but arnt most hong kong films. never the less i think its a brilliant action movie and one of van damme's best movies of the 90's i recommend

    Jack Quinn(Jean Claude Van Damme, who gets to do plenty of the high kicks that he's famous for) retires from being a counter-terrorist, is brought back(yup, the clich&eacute;s, formulaic nature and stereotypes that drown every line of dialog and every other aspect of the writing in this come in right at the beginning) to take out Stavros(Rourke, who makes for a cool villain and comes off as a genuine match to him, in the realms of fighting and tactics), who used to... uh... well, now he's going to... hm... you know, I have no clue. Anyway, it goes wrong, his son dies in the chaos(this time, it's personal?), and JCVD is sent to The Colony, a secret(somehow...) think-tank comprised of former agents and enemies, leading us to wonder why they don't kill each other(and there literally appears to be no guards there... heck, even if it meant their death, they might be fanatic enough), they can move about though they have to check in at specific times. Along the way he also meets Yaz(...I know all three of those letters, but they don't go together like that), a world-class arms dealer(Rodman, who also gets to take part in the decently choreographed and covered martial arts of which there is a pretty good amount) in aÂ… let's call it a bi-curious nightclub, and they throw in some basketball references(because, and this may surprise you, apparently Dennis dabbled in that field, briefly). He's only in half of it, but he can't act and at times he doesn't seem capable of shutting up(man, does he get to be obnoxious). This is full of over the top action where physics take a back seat, there is excessive use of Dutch angles, and, like Speed, exhausting if you're not in the mood for it. Is it fun? Well, if you leave your brain at the door, and you aren't distracted by really goofy, out of place stuff... like this weird "focus" or sixth sense kind of thing to both the hero and bad guy. And the tigers. This is actually downright hard to follow at points, because of how... dumb it is. There is brief moderate to strong language in this. The DVD comes with a trailer. I recommend this to adrenaline junkies. 5/10

    For those who like movies that involve bombs, shots, broken glasses and lack of reason or reality, this movie will work. It's just one of those movies where Van Damme defeats his team (in this case, his double team) and we get to see some adrenalin scenes and we really want the main actor to win. Also, I was expecting to see more fight scenes and less easy kills with guns. You know, body fighting is much more thrilling and more entertaining than just shooting and killing. I remember enjoying his movies when I was younger, but nowadays I prefer a well written story/plot instead of cheap killing spree without a purpose. Anyways, not a bad movie at all, but isn't my type.

    A lot of people call "Indipendence Day" a "masterpiece" or a "good blockbuster". A lot of people call "Double Team" a "crappy movie" or a "plothole fest", since that people claims that "Indipendence Day" is a good movie, why i can't say that Double Team is cool and better than Indipendence Day ? The movie stars Jean Claude Van-Damme (playing the character Jack Quinn), i don't care about your opinion, most of people hate him because of his "bad acting" (seriously, do you care about acting ?), but he have a lot of potential and like in most of his movies, he shows good skills in martial arts. Dennis Rodman (playing the character Yaz), is another actor that everyone hates because of his "bad acting", but i liked his performance as a sidekick. Mickey Rourke (playing the character Stavros), plays the villain, good performance also. Double team is directed by Tsui Hark, a awesome Hong Kong director, i liked Double team as i liked his movies made in Hong Kong. The action scenes are great, we get both martial arts fighting and shootouts. The score is great also, the music in the credits by Crystal Waters (featuring: Dennis Rodman), made me watch it until the credits rolled to the last second. The cheesy CGI effects had their fashion. Also, there is a small surprise in the ending, involving coke vending machines, don't worry i am not going to spoil it. I am not expecting some academy award winner, it's an action movie ! Who care about plot holes ?

    The action-packed, globe-trotting Jean-Claude Van Damme adventure "Double Team" derives its sporty title from the unlikely combo of NBA bad boy Dennis Rodman and Van Damme in pursuit of arch foe Mickey Rourke. "Double Team" might have been drivel at a dribble were it not for the dazzling aplomb with which gifted Hong Kong action helmer Tsui Hark stages a number of snappy, hyperkinetic action sequences. Van Damme stars as Jack Quinn, the best counter-terrorist in the business, who retires and settles down with his wife Kathryn (French television actress Natacha Lindinger) to raise a family. His old bosses lure Jack back into the spy game to ice his oldest foe, Stavros (Mickey Rourke of "Sin City"). At an ambush in Antwerp, everything goes wrong. Quinn nearly dies from an explosion, and the wily Stavros eludes death. When Quinn recovers, he finds himself trapped on an island fortress called the Penal Colony with no hope for escape. The seas around the island are a maze of laser beams. The Colony guardian Goldsmythe (Paul Freeman), explains to Quinn that he is confined to the island for the remainder of his life in the dubious company of the deadliest spies in the world. Not only are they too valuable to terminate, but also that are too lethal to be let loose. According to Goldsmythe, the Penal Colony serves as an espionage think tank. Equipped with the latest high-tech gadgetry, these Penal Colony lifers act as consultants in resolving international disputes. Of course, Quinn devises a stunning escape plan based on split-second timing. Meanwhile, Stavros kidnaps his pregnant wife and sweeps her off to Rome. Stavros has every reason to hat Jack Quinn. Stavros took Quinn's wife as hostage. After he engineers a daring daylight escape, Quinn saves his wife from a ruthless death squad in the Eternal City. Although Kathryn gives birth to a baby boy, Stavros manages to stay a step ahead of Quinn and abducts the newborn. Quinn confronts Stavros in a land mine laden Roman Coliseum and battles a ravenous Bengal tiger. Our hero relieves heavily on the firepower provided by a weird underground CIA arms dealer named Yaz (Dennis Rodman) in both on Stavros. Yaz himself comes along to play against the bad guys in a bullet-scarred finale. Scenarists Don ("Lifeforce") Jakoby and Paul ("The Quest") Mones pull out all stops with an audacious, slam dunk script that resembles a James Bond extravaganza, complete with several exotic settings. Of course, the Jakoby & Mones' screenplay is thoroughly predictable, but these writers know how to tweak the formula with a fresh gag or two. Hong Kong action helmer Hark makes the third Royal Colony refugee that Van Damme has called on to direct his movies. Earlier, Van Damme tapped John Woo to call the shots on "Hard Target, but John Travolta has since wooed Woo to direct "Broken Arrow" and "Face/Off" with Nicolas Cage. In "Maximum Risk," Van Damme imported the services of the skilled Ringo Lam. Unlike both "Hard Target" and "Maximum Risk," "Double Team" takes its far-fetched plot to preposterously outlandish lengths. Hark never lets the supercharged action idle away in this stylist thriller. He enlivens the action sequences with the kind of bravura that make you want to flinch and duck. The fight between Van Damme and as Asian henchman who grips a switchblade between his toes is invigoratingly fresh. And the computerized cyber-monks in the Vatican are a scream. Jean-Claude Van Damme spends more time averting disaster than acting, but nobody watches a JCVD movie to see the star emote. Credit Van Damme with modeling the appropriate expression for each crisis. Mickey Rourke is the thespian to appreciate. His truly cool villain is an anthology of postures. If Paul Freeman, who plays the Penal Colony guardian, appears familiar, you may remember him as the adversary with whom Indiana Jones tangled in "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Meanwhile, Dennis Rodman is not so much an actor as he is a special effect. As Yaz, Rodman pedals a flashy arsenal for Van Damme as well as gives the film some of its lighter moments. When the initially encounter each other, Van Damme looks at Rodman and questions him about who does his hair? Siegfried or Roy? With a ring or a stud on most of his bodily appendages, an array of Yazoo Tattoos and his multicolored turf, Rodman looks as funny as he does lethal. The scene where Rodman steals a car that he has to steer with his head sticking through the sun roof is hilarious. Director Tsui Hark deploys the scene-stealing Rodman at the right moments to offset the straight-faced heroics of Van Damme. The worst thing that you can say about "Double Team" is the shameless product placement scene in the Coliseum. A number of Coke machine keep our heroes from getting cremated by the usual quota of apocalyptic explosions. On the other hand, the scene where scores of Coke cans complicate the heroics of Jean-Claude is good. If you are a JCVD fan, you get to see our protagonist articulate his muscles from Brussels in a couple of well-choreographed combat sequences. If you enjoy watching glossy, superbly lensed action movies, "Double Team" ought to keep you entertained and occupied. The inventive script, the electrifying directing, and the stirring Gary Chang music contribute to the success of "Double Team."

    Movies You Wish Stayed Forgotten: Double Team (1997)

    courtesy of www.PopBunker.net We've all had it happen. A day will be going merrily along with normal annoyances and accomplishments. Then suddenly, out random chaos, something triggers the memory of an innocent of something so profoundly awful and cringe-inducing that all he wishes is that the memory would have stayed forgotten. Sometimes the buried memory is in the form of an embarrassing moment; like taking out one's junk and swinging it around at a wedding reception. And other times it is bewildering reminders of craptacular movies like Double Team. My day "job" includes managing an online inventory. Recently we obtained around 300 DVDs to add to our online and brick and mortar inventory. Usually I don't pay attention to titles when mindlessly adding to our inventory. But yesterday I was struck as if by a malevolent satorie when this DVD came through. I tweeted about it and got back a few colorful responses with regards to re-opening this wound of a movie in the minds of many. So what was so awful about "Double Team?" Well, first of all the name: Double Team. Everyone is entitled to his most far-fetched fantasy, but I can't imagine anyone Â– not even the most strong stomach celeb stalker Â– wanting to be doubled teamed by JCVD and Dennis Rodman. It would be like having a fantasy involving a threesome with Larry King and Frances Bay (Granda from Happy Gilmore) while everyone wears a KISS mask. It just doesn't compute even to the most perverse of minds. The next thingÂ… wellÂ… Dennis Rodman. I mean just image google his name. Or don't. Be who you wanna be, kid. It's all good. But to be who Rodman is and mix that with the absolute fact that he can act about as well as he shot three-pointers (23.1%) makes a mess recipe for a movie. "Double Team" even had Mickey Rourke when he was an a-hole everyone hated instead of The Wrestler reborn a-hole that everyone suddenly thinks is cool because he is in Iron Man 2. (A side note: Rourke is the ultimate retro-cool has-been a-hole re-made into the suddenly in-demand cool a-hole that soon everyone will remember is an a-hole and will be cast aside once again. It's a crazy business.) The last thing I'm going to point out in "what was so awful aboutÂ…" is that it was a stone cold career killer for JCVD. It may well be that JCVD was going to have a short career arc as a major action player anyway, but in the three years leading up to "Double Team," he was in Timecop (1994), Streetfighter & Sudden Death (1995), The Quest & Maximum Risk (1996). "Double Team" flushed down in 1997 and thenÂ… that was it. I think everything after "Double Team" was a direct-to-DVD or limited release for JCVD. JCVD was not known for quality cinema, but he was known for exploitative movies made for men who love movies made for men. JCVD movies were cheap to make and did enough bank at the box officeÂ… until "Double Team." Not even men who love movies made for men could love JCVD after he was in a movie with Dennis Rodman that, if I remember correctly, featured a fight or chase or something where Rodman's mode of attack was Grabbing a Rebound Kung-fu or some ridiculous junk like that. I know it involved a gratuitously out of place basketball reference somehow. courtesy of www.PopBunker.net

    This is not a very good movie, but pretty good, stylish and enjoyable, so one of Van Damme's bests. I don't see Jean Claude Van Damme as a bad actor, may be because I like him, he was one of my childhood heroes. It seems that he did what people wanted from him. Some say that he is hopelessly untalented, but he has a pulling power, hasn't he? Otherwise, now there would not have been a lot of Van Damme fans, even if they have lessened day after day. I watched almost all his films except his first movie and a few of his recent movies and to me Double Team is from his golden period. By the way, I learned that Tsui Hark hates John Woo's The Killer. If you ask me, he is absolutely right. Because according to many people The Killer is a great action film, but to it was extremely slow paced except the final part and not stylish. Probably, like me, Hark had sat down to watch an action movie, but it was not. Double Team is non stop action. In comparison with some recent soap bubble and very slow paced action movies like The Sentinel or The Shooter, Double Team is not only very fast paced, but also pretty stylish. However, the most odd thing is that even the ratings of the awful movies of Van Damme such as Second in Command, Wake of Death, In Hell, The Order or Inferno are higher than Double Team. ??? The whole movie is fun owing to Hark, Van Damme and Rodman who adds color to the movie. Watching Rourke who brings a pessimistic tone to the movie is also interesting. The operation in the funfair part consists of very stylish action scenes. This colorful part is one of the best parts of the movie. As you know, all of the early Van Damme films include training scenes, they are famous for those scenes, too (to me) In Double Team, there is a training scene too. The only flawed point comes in the end, the end was unrealistic with bad CGI. And the images I have not forgotten since 1997. The face of Van Damme in the end of the hospital scene, the face of Mickey Rourke in the stadium, finger scene and Rodman's question: ''Did you open it?''
