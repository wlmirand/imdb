    OK , so this movie obviously isn't a masterpiece or even a good movie. It doesn't mean you can't give this popcorn flick a chance for one night of unambitious cinema. There is a similar movie to this one - "Drop zone " with Wesley Snipes . Some people are arguing about which one is a rip-off the second . To be honest , I don't really care about that because both are just decent popcorn movies , nothing more. I'm not a fan of Charlie Sheen , but I 've found him to be enjoyable in this one . Nastassja Kinski was very likable and gives a good performance . In my opinion she is the heart of the movie . It was also good to see James Gandolfini (RIP) , even if the twist with him was obvious . The romance was quite fine . I did laugh sincerely a couple of times and there is some decent mystery to keep the viewer interested. Mind that the screenplay isn't really spectacular and the action scenes are rather too over the top . Overall , a decent popcorn movie . It never becomes anything more , but we should appreciate it for what it is , especially now , when Hollywood very often struggles to create a watchable entertainment for mass audiences. I give it 5/10.

    Terminal Velocity, it is what you most likely think it is. Another dumb action film featuring a hot double act of pretty boy and pretty girl. However, and I say this not with tongue in cheek, it is damn entertaining in that popcorn munching way. Hey, at least it didn't have billions spent on it and wasn't based on a computer game. Charlie Sheen is a sky diving maverick who gets involved in a life threatening situation after meeting Nastassja Kinski's slinky Chris Morrow. Enter Russian baddies, lots of gold and Christopher McDonald entering the hall of fame for worst villain portrayals. Director Deran Sarafian (Death Warrant) keeps it brisk, Joel McNeely lifts from Die Hard and Basic Instinct for his musical score and a few scenes are well worth the time of action movie junkies (the finale involving a car falling from a plane is really thrilling). It's not high art, but nobody should be expecting that, and to really get in the mood for it you may need to drink the Tequila worm that Kinski does here, but this is far from being the worst action movie of the early 90s. 6/10

Ditch is suspicious that all is not as it seems, because he distinctly remembers hooking her static line on... Charlie Sheen continued his run of nineties movies that should have made him a big star without tiger blood and other men, with this ridiculous, over the top, but fun movie. it's best not to take this film seriously at all, else you will find many flaws. Instead, just enjoy the very well choreographed action and jump scenes, the excellent story written by Twohy, and some brilliant one liners. This has to be sheens best film from the nineties that isn't Hot Shots! and proved he could handle action pretty well. of course, it's a mile from films like Wall Street and Platoon, but when the trailer features a car free falling and makes you smile, it's clear you're not looking for an intelligent night at the movies. This was unfairly overlooked at the cinema, maybe this was due to the fact that a similar movie 'Drop Zone' was released first (which was good, but far too serious. It's forgettable stuff for sure, but it's fun, breezy and entertaining all the way through. One of the nineties guiltiest pleasures.

    This is one of the memorable flicks of the 1990s. Of course not in the same shelf that has (Con Air), (The Rock), (Face Off), but you may find it at the lower one, and when you check it out you'll be surprised. The Action is super but not that totally crazy as some likes from the same era. True that the ultimate tagline of all of this kind of movies is "don't you ever think" but here even if you did, you'd see how it got a little bit of inner logic. You've got to love and respect that script, it did it well. The climax's sequence was so tough a' la James Bond grand style. Thanks to director (Deran Sarafian) who presented also (Gunmen - 1994) another good Action. The only problem, a big one too, is (Charlie Sheen) ! Actually with a movie like that you'd think young (Clint Eastwood), or (Willis), or even (Sly), but not Mr. shining black hair who can't act well. His charisma is weaker than the role. He's funny for sometimes but silly frigid for most of the time. Still good noise though, and definitely the most amusing among the series of the unfortunate events that (Sheen) did it during the 1990s (The Arrival, Postmortem, Free Money, No Code of Conduct, ..etc) before his merciful retirement from cinema (temporarily or eternally I think the cinema retired from him !) to establish a TV career with (2 Men & Half) which's another flop if you asked me. So (Terminal Velocity) compared to (Sheen)'s original disasters is like paradise, but he still in it. I said once that the main defect, sometimes the only defect, with movies by (Tom Cruise), (Ben Affleck) or (Charlie Sheen) is that they're their leads !

    I don't see how some people rate this movie so highly. The "Russians as menace" trope was by then threadbare, the dialogue was wooden, the minutes-long scene of skydiving near the end stretches credibility beyond the breaking point and the characters were flimsy even for a sendup of the genre, which it seemed to be attempting. This is possibly the worst film I've seen in a theater. The only redeeming feature I saw in it was that a few scenes in it showed the some of cool scenery near my hometown. I don't have contempt for this movie, just pity. Don't rent this movie, because it's too bad to be good, and not bad enough to be so bad that it's good.

    "Terminal Velocity" is another one of those highly charged, average adventure films with over the top action and absolutely no plot. Director Deran Sarafian makes sure the action comes thick and fast, with some of the stunts being truly spectacular, especially one particular scene in which our hero finds himself hurtling towards the earth in a convertible car, from thousands of feet up! The movie is loud, fast and has an unrelenting pace which should keep most movie-goers too preoccupied to be worrying about the absent storyline. Charlie Sheen and Nastassja Kinski star, and both fit the bill nicely as the attractive, home grown (maybe not Nastassja) heroes, yet both have little depth to work with. What disappoints me is that Charlie Sheen is so much better than this. After struggling to make a name for himself, he really sky rocketed to stardom with two sensational performances, first in Oliver Stone's "Platoon" (86), and then again for Stone in "Wall Street" (88). Since then though it's been downhill all the way for Sheen as he quickly returned to selecting second rate scripts. Kinski (who still looks sensational) is also much better than this movie would suggest. David Twohy's script, about a hot shot skydiver who suddenly finds his world turned upside down when a mysterious 'student' enters his life, avoids the painfully obvious just enough. There's no obligatory love scene for instance, but all the villains are predictably wicked and two dimensional, and all get their comeuppance. Just another reluctant hero saving the world from evil clutches. Friday, February 10, 1995 - Greater Union Melbourne

    Terminal Velocity is set in Arizona where maverick skydiver Richard 'Ditch' Brodie (Charlie Sheen) takes a job from the attractive Chris Morrow (Nastassja Kinski) to do a jump with her, however things go wrong & she falls out of the plane & ends up dead on the ground 1000's of feet below. Richard decides to do a little investigating & discovers that Chris is still alive & is an ex Russian KGB agent trying to stop another ex Russian KGB agent Ben Pinkwater (James Gandolfini) from stealing $600 million worth of hi-jacked Russian gold & together with Chris he decides to stop the bad guy's & clear his name... Directed by Deran Sarafian I actually thought Terminal Velocity was a decent & enjoyable little action flick. The script by executive producer David Twohy moves along like a rocket although after the intriguing set up when Chris fakes her own death it sort of settles back down into standard action film thriller territory. The film never seems to take itself seriously & is fairly light hearted with some amusing one liners coming from Sheen, I loved the 'pack your bags we're going on a guilt trip' line he comes out with as Kinski tells him about the hardship Russians have! It's nothing terribly original, it's clich&eacute;d in the sense there are the hero's who eventually defeat the bad guy's & save the day but it's fun & provides a fair amount of entertainment if your looking for some light action. Director Sarafian does a decent job, it's not particularly stylish but it's well made with some good action scenes. The skydiving stunts are particularly impressive although some seem a little far fetched especially the way Sheen rescue Kinski from a car that's been driven out the back of a plane. There are some neat enough explosions & fist fights as well. With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 it tanked at the box-office making a paltry $16,000,000. The acting is alright with Sheen making a likable hero. Terminal Velocity turned out much better than I thought it would & I'm struggling to see why it bombed so badly when it was released, anyway I liked it & thought it was entertaining fun.

    Charlie Sheen was NOT a genius in this work. This was pretty lame, actually, in both substance and execution, however, it does bear some fun elements, and delivers a moderate amount of entertainment. I can't say that I'm surprised that Sheen's work is horribly lacking; it seems his fire went out right after Young Guns. This film is not much of anything, in the great scheme of cinematic wonders, however, it manages to deliver a bit of enjoyment, I think in SPITE of itself, rather than because of the work itself. Many think this was great fun, so as usual, I'm in the minority when I say that I found this film dated, puerile, and under-dramatized while it was also boring, uneventful, and anticlimactic drivel. It does manage a small amount of enjoyment/entertainment quality, if only mildly. It rates a 3.8/10 from... the Fiend :.

    This was a generally fun film that is considered an action movie, and rightly so, but has its share of good comedy, too. Charlie Sheen showed he was well on his way to being successful playing comedic roles, as he's doing on television right now. Nastassja Kinski plays the typical new young macho-female role that introduced on screen in the past generation in which females beat up males. Give me a break! Anyway, I still liked her despite the characterization. James Gandolfini was the best of the villains, and also demonstrated how he was about ready to hit the big time, which he also has on TV with The Sopranos. Christopher McDonald was another villain in here but was stupid, not fun to watch. He was angry all the time and his bleached hair looked ludicrous. There are a couple of outrageous action scenes in this film, mostly notably when an automobile with Sheen and Kinski still in it is dropped from an airplane! Yes, to enjoy this film don't take any of it seriously! It's simply fast-paced entertainment. For that, it gets a good rating.

    I don't understand certain people's hatred for this movie. If you are expecting 100% reality then you will be disappointed. Why would someone expect 100% reality from anything that comes from Hollywood? I don't, and that is why I liked this movie. I am a cop, and I watch CSI. The only reason I watch CSI is because they have very unique ways of people dying. Other than that it is a dumb unrealistic show just from the very basic points of it. Terminal Velocity has good action sequences. My favorite scene is where he and Natasha are in the super sonic land rocket and use it to get away from the bad guys. Completely unrealistic? Of course, but it was exciting. It wasn't great, but it was just a basically entertaining movie. My Point here is don't expect too much from Hollywood.

Charlie Sheen showed he was well on his way to being successful playing comedic roles, as he's doing on television right now. Nastassja Kinski plays the typical new young macho-female role that introduced on screen in the past generation in which females beat up males. Give me a break! Anyway, I still liked her despite the characterization. James Gandolfini was the best of the villains, and also demonstrated how he was about ready to hit the big time, which he also has on TV with The Sopranos. Christopher McDonald was another villain in here but was stupid, not fun to watch. He was angry all the time and his bleached hair looked ludicrous. There are a couple of outrageous action scenes in this film, mostly notably when an automobile with Sheen and Kinski still in it is dropped from an airplane! Yes, to enjoy this film don't take any of it seriously! It's simply fast-paced entertainment. For that, it gets a good rating.

    I don't understand certain people's hatred for this movie. If you are expecting 100% reality then you will be disappointed. Why would someone expect 100% reality from anything that comes from Hollywood? I don't, and that is why I liked this movie. I am a cop, and I watch CSI. The only reason I watch CSI is because they have very unique ways of people dying. Other than that it is a dumb unrealistic show just from the very basic points of it. Terminal Velocity has good action sequences. My favorite scene is where he and Natasha are in the super sonic land rocket and use it to get away from the bad guys. Completely unrealistic? Of course, but it was exciting. It wasn't great, but it was just a basically entertaining movie. My Point here is don't expect too much from Hollywood.

    OK , so this movie obviously isn't a masterpiece or even a good movie. It doesn't mean you can't give this popcorn flick a chance for one night of unambitious cinema. There is a similar movie to this one - "Drop zone " with Wesley Snipes . Some people are arguing about which one is a rip-off the second . To be honest , I don't really care about that because both are just decent popcorn movies , nothing more. I'm not a fan of Charlie Sheen , but I 've found him to be enjoyable in this one . Nastassja Kinski was very likable and gives a good performance . In my opinion she is the heart of the movie . It was also good to see James Gandolfini (RIP) , even if the twist with him was obvious . The romance was quite fine . I did laugh sincerely a couple of times and there is some decent mystery to keep the viewer interested. Mind that the screenplay isn't really spectacular and the action scenes are rather too over the top . Overall , a decent popcorn movie . It never becomes anything more , but we should appreciate it for what it is , especially now , when Hollywood very often struggles to create a watchable entertainment for mass audiences. I give it 5/10.

    Terminal Velocity, it is what you most likely think it is. Another dumb action film featuring a hot double act of pretty boy and pretty girl. However, and I say this not with tongue in cheek, it is damn entertaining in that popcorn munching way. Hey, at least it didn't have billions spent on it and wasn't based on a computer game. Charlie Sheen is a sky diving maverick who gets involved in a life threatening situation after meeting Nastassja Kinski's slinky Chris Morrow. Enter Russian baddies, lots of gold and Christopher McDonald entering the hall of fame for worst villain portrayals. Director Deran Sarafian (Death Warrant) keeps it brisk, Joel McNeely lifts from Die Hard and Basic Instinct for his musical score and a few scenes are well worth the time of action movie junkies (the finale involving a car falling from a plane is really thrilling). It's not high art, but nobody should be expecting that, and to really get in the mood for it you may need to drink the Tequila worm that Kinski does here, but this is far from being the worst action movie of the early 90s. 6/10

    Ditch Brodie is a maverick skydiving instructor. One day, a beautiful girl comes in, wanting to take her first jump. Up in the air, Ditch takes his eyes off her momentarily, then looks back to find out that she has fallen out, dying on impact. Ditch is suspicious that all is not as it seems, because he distinctly remembers hooking her static line on... Charlie Sheen continued his run of nineties movies that should have made him a big star without tiger blood and other men, with this ridiculous, over the top, but fun movie. it's best not to take this film seriously at all, else you will find many flaws. Instead, just enjoy the very well choreographed action and jump scenes, the excellent story written by Twohy, and some brilliant one liners. This has to be sheens best film from the nineties that isn't Hot Shots! and proved he could handle action pretty well. of course, it's a mile from films like Wall Street and Platoon, but when the trailer features a car free falling and makes you smile, it's clear you're not looking for an intelligent night at the movies. This was unfairly overlooked at the cinema, maybe this was due to the fact that a similar movie 'Drop Zone' was released first (which was good, but far too serious. It's forgettable stuff for sure, but it's fun, breezy and entertaining all the way through. One of the nineties guiltiest pleasures.

    This is one of the memorable flicks of the 1990s. Of course not in the same shelf that has (Con Air), (The Rock), (Face Off), but you may find it at the lower one, and when you check it out you'll be surprised. The Action is super but not that totally crazy as some likes from the same era. True that the ultimate tagline of all of this kind of movies is "don't you ever think" but here even if you did, you'd see how it got a little bit of inner logic. You've got to love and respect that script, it did it well. The climax's sequence was so tough a' la James Bond grand style. Thanks to director (Deran Sarafian) who presented also (Gunmen - 1994) another good Action. The only problem, a big one too, is (Charlie Sheen) ! Actually with a movie like that you'd think young (Clint Eastwood), or (Willis), or even (Sly), but not Mr. shining black hair who can't act well. His charisma is weaker than the role. He's funny for sometimes but silly frigid for most of the time. Still good noise though, and definitely the most amusing among the series of the unfortunate events that (Sheen) did it during the 1990s (The Arrival, Postmortem, Free Money, No Code of Conduct, ..etc) before his merciful retirement from cinema (temporarily or eternally I think the cinema retired from him !) to establish a TV career with (2 Men & Half) which's another flop if you asked me. So (Terminal Velocity) compared to (Sheen)'s original disasters is like paradise, but he still in it. I said once that the main defect, sometimes the only defect, with movies by (Tom Cruise), (Ben Affleck) or (Charlie Sheen) is that they're their leads !

    I don't see how some people rate this movie so highly. The "Russians as menace" trope was by then threadbare, the dialogue was wooden, the minutes-long scene of skydiving near the end stretches credibility beyond the breaking point and the characters were flimsy even for a sendup of the genre, which it seemed to be attempting. This is possibly the worst film I've seen in a theater. The only redeeming feature I saw in it was that a few scenes in it showed the some of cool scenery near my hometown. I don't have contempt for this movie, just pity. Don't rent this movie, because it's too bad to be good, and not bad enough to be so bad that it's good.

    "Terminal Velocity" is another one of those highly charged, average adventure films with over the top action and absolutely no plot. Director Deran Sarafian makes sure the action comes thick and fast, with some of the stunts being truly spectacular, especially one particular scene in which our hero finds himself hurtling towards the earth in a convertible car, from thousands of feet up! The movie is loud, fast and has an unrelenting pace which should keep most movie-goers too preoccupied to be worrying about the absent storyline. Charlie Sheen and Nastassja Kinski star, and both fit the bill nicely as the attractive, home grown (maybe not Nastassja) heroes, yet both have little depth to work with. What disappoints me is that Charlie Sheen is so much better than this. After struggling to make a name for himself, he really sky rocketed to stardom with two sensational performances, first in Oliver Stone's "Platoon" (86), and then again for Stone in "Wall Street" (88). Since then though it's been downhill all the way for Sheen as he quickly returned to selecting second rate scripts. Kinski (who still looks sensational) is also much better than this movie would suggest. David Twohy's script, about a hot shot skydiver who suddenly finds his world turned upside down when a mysterious 'student' enters his life, avoids the painfully obvious just enough. There's no obligatory love scene for instance, but all the villains are predictably wicked and two dimensional, and all get their comeuppance. Just another reluctant hero saving the world from evil clutches. Friday, February 10, 1995 - Greater Union Melbourne

    Terminal Velocity is set in Arizona where maverick skydiver Richard 'Ditch' Brodie (Charlie Sheen) takes a job from the attractive Chris Morrow (Nastassja Kinski) to do a jump with her, however things go wrong & she falls out of the plane & ends up dead on the ground 1000's of feet below. Richard decides to do a little investigating & discovers that Chris is still alive & is an ex Russian KGB agent trying to stop another ex Russian KGB agent Ben Pinkwater (James Gandolfini) from stealing $600 million worth of hi-jacked Russian gold & together with Chris he decides to stop the bad guy's & clear his name... Directed by Deran Sarafian I actually thought Terminal Velocity was a decent & enjoyable little action flick. The script by executive producer David Twohy moves along like a rocket although after the intriguing set up when Chris fakes her own death it sort of settles back down into standard action film thriller territory. The film never seems to take itself seriously & is fairly light hearted with some amusing one liners coming from Sheen, I loved the 'pack your bags we're going on a guilt trip' line he comes out with as Kinski tells him about the hardship Russians have! It's nothing terribly original, it's clich&eacute;d in the sense there are the hero's who eventually defeat the bad guy's & save the day but it's fun & provides a fair amount of entertainment if your looking for some light action. Director Sarafian does a decent job, it's not particularly stylish but it's well made with some good action scenes. The skydiving stunts are particularly impressive although some seem a little far fetched especially the way Sheen rescue Kinski from a car that's been driven out the back of a plane. There are some neat enough explosions & fist fights as well. With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 it tanked at the box-office making a paltry $16,000,000. The acting is alright with Sheen making a likable hero. Terminal Velocity turned out much better than I thought it would & I'm struggling to see why it bombed so badly when it was released, anyway I liked it & thought it was entertaining fun.

    Charlie Sheen was NOT a genius in this work. This was pretty lame, actually, in both substance and execution, however, it does bear some fun elements, and delivers a moderate amount of entertainment. I can't say that I'm surprised that Sheen's work is horribly lacking; it seems his fire went out right after Young Guns. This film is not much of anything, in the great scheme of cinematic wonders, however, it manages to deliver a bit of enjoyment, I think in SPITE of itself, rather than because of the work itself. Many think this was great fun, so as usual, I'm in the minority when I say that I found this film dated, puerile, and under-dramatized while it was also boring, uneventful, and anticlimactic drivel. It does manage a small amount of enjoyment/entertainment quality, if only mildly. It rates a 3.8/10 from... the Fiend :.

Charlie Sheen showed he was well on his way to being successful playing comedic roles, as he's doing on television right now. Nastassja Kinski plays the typical new young macho-female role that introduced on screen in the past generation in which females beat up males. Give me a break! Anyway, I still liked her despite the characterization. James Gandolfini was the best of the villains, and also demonstrated how he was about ready to hit the big time, which he also has on TV with The Sopranos. Christopher McDonald was another villain in here but was stupid, not fun to watch. He was angry all the time and his bleached hair looked ludicrous. There are a couple of outrageous action scenes in this film, mostly notably when an automobile with Sheen and Kinski still in it is dropped from an airplane! Yes, to enjoy this film don't take any of it seriously! It's simply fast-paced entertainment. For that, it gets a good rating.

    I don't understand certain people's hatred for this movie. If you are expecting 100% reality then you will be disappointed. Why would someone expect 100% reality from anything that comes from Hollywood? I don't, and that is why I liked this movie. I am a cop, and I watch CSI. The only reason I watch CSI is because they have very unique ways of people dying. Other than that it is a dumb unrealistic show just from the very basic points of it. Terminal Velocity has good action sequences. My favorite scene is where he and Natasha are in the super sonic land rocket and use it to get away from the bad guys. Completely unrealistic? Of course, but it was exciting. It wasn't great, but it was just a basically entertaining movie. My Point here is don't expect too much from Hollywood.
