    "Father of the Bride" is such a flawless film that you cannot truly appreciate its artistry unless you watch it more than once. Splendidly cast, splendidly thesped, and perfectly hilarious without stooping to lowest common denominator humor to score points, this comedy was made when comedies could be funny without being stupid. Everything is told from the perspective of the eponymous character. Indeed, the entire movie constitutes a flashback as it opens with a disheveled Stanley Adams (Spencer Tracy) and his wife Ellie (Joan Bennett) sitting in the shambles of their house after their daughter Kay (Elizabeth Taylor) has been hitched to Buckley Dunstan (Don Taylor). Most of the comedy grows out of the predicaments that Tracy and company find themselves in when it comes time to throw a marriage for their daughter. For example, at the announcement of Kay's wedding, Stanley has planned a small speech, but he finds himself stuck in the kitchen of their house mixing drinks for the guests. When he finally gets a chance to get out of the kitchen and deliver his speech, everybody has left the premises. Later, Stanley has a nightmare about Kay's wedding; he dreams that he is trying to walk up the aisle, but the aisle turns into a surreal path and it is little for than a trampoline and our protagonist is struggling to keep his suit on no matter how rough the aisle becomes. At one point, when Buckley decides that Kay and he should honeymoon in Nova Scotia because the fishing is fantastic, Kay almost has the wedding canceled. She complains to Pops that she wouldn't have the opportunity to display herself in all her evening apparel. Predictably, Buckley arrives and they fall into each other's arms. Clocking in at 94 nimble minutes, "Father of the Bride" qualifies as superior entertainment for the entire family. Incidentally, a sequel followed entitled "Father's Little Dividends" with Spencer Tracy and virtually the entire cast reprising their roles under the sure-handed direction of Vincente Minnelli. Other interesting scenes that stand out include the Coke scene in the kitchen when a younger man has to teach Spencer Tracy the correct way to remove the cap from a bottle of soda pop. Another cute scene involves an older Tracy trying to squeeze into his old cutaway suit. Although he manages to squeeze into it, Stanley later splits the seams in the back when he struggles to open two jammed door. Yes, Steve Martin stepped into Tracy's shoes for the 1991 remake and the 1995 sequel.

    For dad Spencer Tracy to get through meeting his daughter's intended through the wedding reception (where he is not even able to get a kiss from her, let alone the father/daughter dance), it is a tribute to his love and sobriety that he doesn't end up in A.A. He isn't so lucky at the meeting of the groom's parents, and at the announcement of the engagement, he doesn't get to make his speech, being too busy getting sprayed in the face with coke. It seems that you have to be under 25 to be able to open a bottle! Then, there's the 6 mint juleps, 4 bourbons, and tray of martinis he's made which nobody seems to want. This is a story of frustration, neglect and being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Desperate to see his kitten toss the bridal bouquet, Tracy tries to get through his own French doors and gets stuck in a crowd to rival the uptown train at Grand Central during rush hour. Having proved himself a top dramatic actor of the past two decades, he added comedy to his forte, first a series of romantic comedy's with Katharine Hepburn, then this magnificently funny film with Joan Bennett as the Myrna Loy like perfect wife and the gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor as the bride to be. Having made so many generic romantic comedy's, MGM must have been delightfully surprised by this one's tremendous success, both commercially and financially. The reason this one is so superb is that it takes on a different approach to a typical plot. By putting the event being seen through dad's eyes (isn't he the one always forgotten once he's walked the bride down the aisle?), screenwriters Hackett and Goodrich added in a type of comedy that dads everywhere (and their slightly guilty wives and daughters) could identify with. Tracy is delightfully deadpan, and isn't anywhere near perfect. He has a conniption fit when the wedding is moved from the house to a church, offers his daughter money to elope, and nervously steps back from the bride, fearful of falling. Bennett and Taylor allow Tracy to control the proceedings, making this a love letter to neglected wedding dads. Don Taylor is funny as the nervous groom, with Leo G. Carroll an effete wedding planner, so officious in his obvious distaste for all of the choices made and aghast at the house he has to re-arrange for the big event. Billie Burke and Moroni Olsen are amusing in their relatively minor roles as Taylor's parents. This is a humble production artistically, as it spoofs the pretensions of planning an event which really should be so personal and often is overstuffed like grand opera.

    First, a word about the main difference between this original story and the Steve Martin remake. The Steve Martin remake is a fine movie, but it is a comedy. The original is, in my view, a real story told with humor. I like both films, but in my view they are not really the same story. If you watch Spencer Tracy's films in order, you'll see him age rapidly in the second half of the 1940s. And here he has completed the transformation into a father figure...in this case a sort of "Father Knows Best" type of father. Yes, Tracy is getting older here, and that phase of his career is perhaps my favorite. This role was perfect for him, and he plays it marvelously. It is this Tracy I remember best. Joan Bennett plays Tracy's wife to a par. Perfect. I'm not a fan of the younger or the older Elizabeth Taylor, but at this age she was a gem, and this is one of her most endearing screen performances. You'll also recognize a number of character actors and actresses, including Billie Burke, Leo G. Carroll, Moroni Olsen, and Paul Harvey. I didn't recognize Russ Tamblyn as one of the sons, although it is a rather minor part. The plot here is simple -- all the real excitement, second thoughts, and planning of a wedding. That's what I mean about this being a real story. Done with light humor, but not a comedy. And excellent film and one deserving of a spot on your DVD shelf.

    I've watched this movie again recently, and I am now going to give it from a different perspective. This movie is very funny, it is very witty and funny! I laughed quite a lot at this movie, it is a very funny movie that is a great way to spend an evening! Is this one of the funniest movies I have ever seen? Yes. Is it a movie that would cause me to roll on the floor laughing? Possibly. Is it funny throughout the course of it? Yes. Is it a movie that once I see it, could I watch it again if I had the chance? Yes. So in short, this is one of the funniest movies ever made, it's a movie that I laughed at quite a lot! There are quite a lot of laughs in this movie, I would name them, but I don't want to spoil the movie for you if you decide to see it in the future. So on a scale from one to ten, one being the worst and ten being the best, I will give this movie a score of ten stars out of ten. So in short, it is not only one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time, it's one of the funniest movies of all time! Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor were hysterical in this movie, they were the best things about this movie, they were at their comedic best! What can make a movie a good movie are the lead actors. If the lead parts are being played by some great actors, then the movie will probably turn out to be good, just like how this one did! I would tell you more about this, but I don't want to spoil the movie for you. If you want to find out what happens, you will just have to take the time to see this movie for yourself. Because you can never really tell how good a movie is until you actually see it. Who knows, you might like it, you might not like it. I think that you will love it! So all in all, this is a gem of a movie, it truly is one of the greatest comedies of all time! If you haven't seen this movie yet, then you should see it, because you are probably going to be laughing at it quite a lot! It's great if you want to see just how funny a movie can possibly get! I mean really funny, this is a hilarious comedy that is a funny as it gets! Like I said before, you can't tell how good or bad a movie is going to be until you actually see it for yourself. When you do watch this movie, be prepared to laugh. So enjoy Father Of The Bride, because it is really funny! Watch it and have a great time laughing at it, because it certainly is a great time! 10/10

    For a while now, I have loved this movie. One or two scenes may feel unrealistic by today's standards, but so much compensates. The film does look very quaint and charming, I loved the style of the cinematography especially. The script is deliciously witty with Tracy getting the best lines, the story is immensely engaging and snappily paced and Vincente Minelli directs impeccably. The acting is also very good. Spencer Tracy is brilliant and gives one of the best performances of his career, while I have only seen one or two other films as of where Elizabeth Taylor looks as lovely as she is here. Overall, Father of the Bride is timeless. When it comes to the 1991 remake, it isn't as good but as far as remakes go it is not bad at all, quite the contrary. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    There's an old saying that the best ideas are the simplest. This is only partly true. The best ideas often stem from a basic concept, but one which yields wide-ranging and elaborate results, and then only if pulled off properly. Father of the Bride has a simple idea at its heart  a straightforward romantic comedy, told from the point of view of someone on the periphery of the romance. However that idea provides the basis for a neatly structured picture that is both funny and endearing. The screenplay, by the fantastic but rarely lauded husband-and-wife writing duo Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, tells a story on two levels. The actual events of the picture of chart the romance and wedding of a young couple, and this is more or less all that actually takes place on screen. However, the device of a voice-over narrative, as well as set-pieces such as the engagement party shown entirely from Spencer Tracy's position as involuntary butler, make this undoubtedly his story. The voice-over was a popular feature of thrillers around this time, but here it serves as a comical inner monologue and commentary. Telling the story through the father's eyes ultimately allows Goodrich and Hackett to make this a tale not of romantic love but of family and paternal affection, and one that is more moving than dozens of run-of-the-mill romcoms. Director Vincente Minnelli was perhaps an odd choice for this project. Having had his biggest successes with musicals, his flowing, flamboyant style could have been a bit over-the-top for such a small-scale real-world setting. However Minnelli's tendency to lead the audience in a certain direction, and his skillful control of elements within the frame bring a lot to Father of the Bride. He is careful to always keep the wedding story going, often literally in the background, while putting Spencer Tracy in the foreground to give us his expressions and reactions. Usually the background goings-on are very busy, helping them to balance out, as well as giving a better comedy effect as Tracy grumps about before the camera. In the scene where the Bankses meet the Dunstons, Minnelli begins successive shots with a close-up of Tracy's martini glass, to give the whole scene the overtone that he is getting more and more drunk as he speaks. One of Minnelli's brightest ideas is to shoot the chaotic wedding rehearsal in one long take from a distant high angle. Not only does this allow the comedy to unfold naturally, it introduces us to the setting but in a slightly detached way. This gives all the more contrast and intensity to the following nightmare sequence, which is all done in close-ups with dozens of cuts. In the titular role Spencer Tracy gives a typically engaging yet understated performance. This kind of thing was really Tracy's forte. He is essentially a comedy character, since it's his grouchiness and his bewilderment that underlie most of the funny bits. But he's not a wild comic  he's also very believable and very human, and more importantly someone we can like and sympathise with. Although Joan Bennett plays her role completely straight and very reserved, it makes sense for the two of them to be a screen couple. And while Katherine Hepburn had the best chemistry with Tracy and it was always nice to see them on screen together, Bennett is the more appropriate actress here, because she is more sedate and will not threaten to upstage Tracy, whose movie it is after all. And Elizabeth Taylor, a huge star even then and arguably the female lead, ultimately has a fairly marginal role both in the script and on the screen. Some commentators bemoan this fact, and even prefer the 1991 remake to this original as a result. And yet it is all organised in such a way  the Goodrich/Hackett screen writing, Minnelli's direction, Tracy's acting  that brings a depth and poignancy to the father-daughter relationship despite Taylor's minimal participation. Take moments such as Tracy's relieved smile as the camera pulls away with him from the young lovers' reunion after their argument, or his frantic searching for his daughter so he can say goodbye before she leaves for the honeymoon. They don't distract from the general pattern of this being the father's story, and yet they reveal his true feelings, sometimes better than many a conventional scene between two people who love each other.

    There are lots of ideas out there that give you fodder for a good comedic story,and the idea of a father having to let go of his "little girl" to marriage,as well as the potential financial strain of it all,is one of those that is ripe for the picking.Spencer Tracy is an excellent choice for the lead character in such a story.Who better than the young,lovely Liz Taylor as the daughter,herself a newlywed? This is indeed a funny film that works on all cylinders.My personal favorite moment has to be the dream sequence,with Tracy running late and unable to walk once he hits the aisle,and falling through the floor.Liz's scream at the end was hysterical.This is a classic comedy.I usually avoid remakes of classic films like this,but the 1991 remake to this film is just as worthy of your attention.Check them both out!

    After his daughter selects a mate, the father must endure sleepless nights, sticker shock, and the disruption of his household as he navigates through the nightmare of wedding planning. Tracy is terrific as the harried father whose plans for a small wedding go awry. As his wife and daughter, Bennett and Liz Taylor aren't given much to do except look supportive and lovely, respectively. Interestingly, both actresses played Amy in film versions of "Little Women," Bennett in 1933 and Taylor in 1949. Don Taylor, who plays the groom, would have a long career as a TV director. Minnelli does a nice job of balancing the comedy and the sentimentality.

    TCM is showing this movie for Father's Day and they are so right. I wish I had the kind of father's love Spencer Tracy had for his daughter. Joan Bennett is so beautiful she could have been Elizabeth Taylor's real mother. This is about the very rich family Banks in the 1950's giving their daughter a wedding (the wedding the mother always wanted but never had). The love expressed by this family and the family of the groom is beautiful. The groom's mother the wonderful Billie Burke the Good Witch of OZ is great!! It's in Black and White and you know I think it is better this way because you see the people not the sets not the glamour of the places and costumes but the reality of their emotions. The funnest part is the dream Spencer has before the wedding, then his sweet little talk with Elizabeth before the big day. I have always thought "Father of Bride" should be co-billed with "A Catered Affair" with Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine It's also about the daughter getting married (Debbie Reynolds as the girl) but this family are working class. Also great acting and a great story more true to real life of the 1950's. I submit Father of the Bride a 10 because when I come across this movie on TV either in the beginning or the middle or near the end I always stop and watch it. Every scene is a gem.

    i did enjoy this film,which was remade in 1991 with Steve Martin.this version is more of a romance than comedy,though there are a some comic bits that do work pretty well.this is the first movie movie i have seen with Spencer Tracy,and i kinda thought he overacted a bit at times.maybe that was intentional,i'm not sure.Steve Martin overacted in his version too,in my opinion.i find it amusing how back then in the 50's they weren't allowed to show a couple sleeping in the same bed,and of course there's a scene where the husband and wife are sleeping in separate beds in the same room,less than a foot away from each other.this trend continued into the 70's.anyway,for a pleasant diversion,you can't go wrong with this movie.for me,Father of the Bride (1950)is a 6/10

    For a while now, I have loved this movie. One or two scenes may feel unrealistic by today's standards, but so much compensates. The film does look very quaint and charming, I loved the style of the cinematography especially. The script is deliciously witty with Tracy getting the best lines, the story is immensely engaging and snappily paced and Vincente Minelli directs impeccably. The acting is also very good. Spencer Tracy is brilliant and gives one of the best performances of his career, while I have only seen one or two other films as of where Elizabeth Taylor looks as lovely as she is here. Overall, Father of the Bride is timeless. When it comes to the 1991 remake, it isn't as good but as far as remakes go it is not bad at all, quite the contrary. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    There's an old saying that the best ideas are the simplest. This is only partly true. The best ideas often stem from a basic concept, but one which yields wide-ranging and elaborate results, and then only if pulled off properly. Father of the Bride has a simple idea at its heart  a straightforward romantic comedy, told from the point of view of someone on the periphery of the romance. However that idea provides the basis for a neatly structured picture that is both funny and endearing. The screenplay, by the fantastic but rarely lauded husband-and-wife writing duo Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, tells a story on two levels. The actual events of the picture of chart the romance and wedding of a young couple, and this is more or less all that actually takes place on screen. However, the device of a voice-over narrative, as well as set-pieces such as the engagement party shown entirely from Spencer Tracy's position as involuntary butler, make this undoubtedly his story. The voice-over was a popular feature of thrillers around this time, but here it serves as a comical inner monologue and commentary. Telling the story through the father's eyes ultimately allows Goodrich and Hackett to make this a tale not of romantic love but of family and paternal affection, and one that is more moving than dozens of run-of-the-mill romcoms. Director Vincente Minnelli was perhaps an odd choice for this project. Having had his biggest successes with musicals, his flowing, flamboyant style could have been a bit over-the-top for such a small-scale real-world setting. However Minnelli's tendency to lead the audience in a certain direction, and his skillful control of elements within the frame bring a lot to Father of the Bride. He is careful to always keep the wedding story going, often literally in the background, while putting Spencer Tracy in the foreground to give us his expressions and reactions. Usually the background goings-on are very busy, helping them to balance out, as well as giving a better comedy effect as Tracy grumps about before the camera. In the scene where the Bankses meet the Dunstons, Minnelli begins successive shots with a close-up of Tracy's martini glass, to give the whole scene the overtone that he is getting more and more drunk as he speaks. One of Minnelli's brightest ideas is to shoot the chaotic wedding rehearsal in one long take from a distant high angle. Not only does this allow the comedy to unfold naturally, it introduces us to the setting but in a slightly detached way. This gives all the more contrast and intensity to the following nightmare sequence, which is all done in close-ups with dozens of cuts. In the titular role Spencer Tracy gives a typically engaging yet understated performance. This kind of thing was really Tracy's forte. He is essentially a comedy character, since it's his grouchiness and his bewilderment that underlie most of the funny bits. But he's not a wild comic  he's also very believable and very human, and more importantly someone we can like and sympathise with. Although Joan Bennett plays her role completely straight and very reserved, it makes sense for the two of them to be a screen couple. And while Katherine Hepburn had the best chemistry with Tracy and it was always nice to see them on screen together, Bennett is the more appropriate actress here, because she is more sedate and will not threaten to upstage Tracy, whose movie it is after all. And Elizabeth Taylor, a huge star even then and arguably the female lead, ultimately has a fairly marginal role both in the script and on the screen. Some commentators bemoan this fact, and even prefer the 1991 remake to this original as a result. And yet it is all organised in such a way  the Goodrich/Hackett screen writing, Minnelli's direction, Tracy's acting  that brings a depth and poignancy to the father-daughter relationship despite Taylor's minimal participation. Take moments such as Tracy's relieved smile as the camera pulls away with him from the young lovers' reunion after their argument, or his frantic searching for his daughter so he can say goodbye before she leaves for the honeymoon. They don't distract from the general pattern of this being the father's story, and yet they reveal his true feelings, sometimes better than many a conventional scene between two people who love each other.

    There are lots of ideas out there that give you fodder for a good comedic story,and the idea of a father having to let go of his "little girl" to marriage,as well as the potential financial strain of it all,is one of those that is ripe for the picking.Spencer Tracy is an excellent choice for the lead character in such a story.Who better than the young,lovely Liz Taylor as the daughter,herself a newlywed? This is indeed a funny film that works on all cylinders.My personal favorite moment has to be the dream sequence,with Tracy running late and unable to walk once he hits the aisle,and falling through the floor.Liz's scream at the end was hysterical.This is a classic comedy.I usually avoid remakes of classic films like this,but the 1991 remake to this film is just as worthy of your attention.Check them both out!

    After his daughter selects a mate, the father must endure sleepless nights, sticker shock, and the disruption of his household as he navigates through the nightmare of wedding planning. Tracy is terrific as the harried father whose plans for a small wedding go awry. As his wife and daughter, Bennett and Liz Taylor aren't given much to do except look supportive and lovely, respectively. Interestingly, both actresses played Amy in film versions of "Little Women," Bennett in 1933 and Taylor in 1949. Don Taylor, who plays the groom, would have a long career as a TV director. Minnelli does a nice job of balancing the comedy and the sentimentality.

    TCM is showing this movie for Father's Day and they are so right. I wish I had the kind of father's love Spencer Tracy had for his daughter. Joan Bennett is so beautiful she could have been Elizabeth Taylor's real mother. This is about the very rich family Banks in the 1950's giving their daughter a wedding (the wedding the mother always wanted but never had). The love expressed by this family and the family of the groom is beautiful. The groom's mother the wonderful Billie Burke the Good Witch of OZ is great!! It's in Black and White and you know I think it is better this way because you see the people not the sets not the glamour of the places and costumes but the reality of their emotions. The funnest part is the dream Spencer has before the wedding, then his sweet little talk with Elizabeth before the big day. I have always thought "Father of Bride" should be co-billed with "A Catered Affair" with Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine It's also about the daughter getting married (Debbie Reynolds as the girl) but this family are working class. Also great acting and a great story more true to real life of the 1950's. I submit Father of the Bride a 10 because when I come across this movie on TV either in the beginning or the middle or near the end I always stop and watch it. Every scene is a gem.

    i did enjoy this film,which was remade in 1991 with Steve Martin.this version is more of a romance than comedy,though there are a some comic bits that do work pretty well.this is the first movie movie i have seen with Spencer Tracy,and i kinda thought he overacted a bit at times.maybe that was intentional,i'm not sure.Steve Martin overacted in his version too,in my opinion.i find it amusing how back then in the 50's they weren't allowed to show a couple sleeping in the same bed,and of course there's a scene where the husband and wife are sleeping in separate beds in the same room,less than a foot away from each other.this trend continued into the 70's.anyway,for a pleasant diversion,you can't go wrong with this movie.for me,Father of the Bride (1950)is a 6/10

    "Father of the Bride" is such a flawless film that you cannot truly appreciate its artistry unless you watch it more than once. Splendidly cast, splendidly thesped, and perfectly hilarious without stooping to lowest common denominator humor to score points, this comedy was made when comedies could be funny without being stupid. Everything is told from the perspective of the eponymous character. Indeed, the entire movie constitutes a flashback as it opens with a disheveled Stanley Adams (Spencer Tracy) and his wife Ellie (Joan Bennett) sitting in the shambles of their house after their daughter Kay (Elizabeth Taylor) has been hitched to Buckley Dunstan (Don Taylor). Most of the comedy grows out of the predicaments that Tracy and company find themselves in when it comes time to throw a marriage for their daughter. For example, at the announcement of Kay's wedding, Stanley has planned a small speech, but he finds himself stuck in the kitchen of their house mixing drinks for the guests. When he finally gets a chance to get out of the kitchen and deliver his speech, everybody has left the premises. Later, Stanley has a nightmare about Kay's wedding; he dreams that he is trying to walk up the aisle, but the aisle turns into a surreal path and it is little for than a trampoline and our protagonist is struggling to keep his suit on no matter how rough the aisle becomes. At one point, when Buckley decides that Kay and he should honeymoon in Nova Scotia because the fishing is fantastic, Kay almost has the wedding canceled. She complains to Pops that she wouldn't have the opportunity to display herself in all her evening apparel. Predictably, Buckley arrives and they fall into each other's arms. Clocking in at 94 nimble minutes, "Father of the Bride" qualifies as superior entertainment for the entire family. Incidentally, a sequel followed entitled "Father's Little Dividends" with Spencer Tracy and virtually the entire cast reprising their roles under the sure-handed direction of Vincente Minnelli. Other interesting scenes that stand out include the Coke scene in the kitchen when a younger man has to teach Spencer Tracy the correct way to remove the cap from a bottle of soda pop. Another cute scene involves an older Tracy trying to squeeze into his old cutaway suit. Although he manages to squeeze into it, Stanley later splits the seams in the back when he struggles to open two jammed door. Yes, Steve Martin stepped into Tracy's shoes for the 1991 remake and the 1995 sequel.

    For dad Spencer Tracy to get through meeting his daughter's intended through the wedding reception (where he is not even able to get a kiss from her, let alone the father/daughter dance), it is a tribute to his love and sobriety that he doesn't end up in A.A. He isn't so lucky at the meeting of the groom's parents, and at the announcement of the engagement, he doesn't get to make his speech, being too busy getting sprayed in the face with coke. It seems that you have to be under 25 to be able to open a bottle! Then, there's the 6 mint juleps, 4 bourbons, and tray of martinis he's made which nobody seems to want. This is a story of frustration, neglect and being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Desperate to see his kitten toss the bridal bouquet, Tracy tries to get through his own French doors and gets stuck in a crowd to rival the uptown train at Grand Central during rush hour. Having proved himself a top dramatic actor of the past two decades, he added comedy to his forte, first a series of romantic comedy's with Katharine Hepburn, then this magnificently funny film with Joan Bennett as the Myrna Loy like perfect wife and the gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor as the bride to be. Having made so many generic romantic comedy's, MGM must have been delightfully surprised by this one's tremendous success, both commercially and financially. The reason this one is so superb is that it takes on a different approach to a typical plot. By putting the event being seen through dad's eyes (isn't he the one always forgotten once he's walked the bride down the aisle?), screenwriters Hackett and Goodrich added in a type of comedy that dads everywhere (and their slightly guilty wives and daughters) could identify with. Tracy is delightfully deadpan, and isn't anywhere near perfect. He has a conniption fit when the wedding is moved from the house to a church, offers his daughter money to elope, and nervously steps back from the bride, fearful of falling. Bennett and Taylor allow Tracy to control the proceedings, making this a love letter to neglected wedding dads. Don Taylor is funny as the nervous groom, with Leo G. Carroll an effete wedding planner, so officious in his obvious distaste for all of the choices made and aghast at the house he has to re-arrange for the big event. Billie Burke and Moroni Olsen are amusing in their relatively minor roles as Taylor's parents. This is a humble production artistically, as it spoofs the pretensions of planning an event which really should be so personal and often is overstuffed like grand opera.

    First, a word about the main difference between this original story and the Steve Martin remake. The Steve Martin remake is a fine movie, but it is a comedy. The original is, in my view, a real story told with humor. I like both films, but in my view they are not really the same story. If you watch Spencer Tracy's films in order, you'll see him age rapidly in the second half of the 1940s. And here he has completed the transformation into a father figure...in this case a sort of "Father Knows Best" type of father. Yes, Tracy is getting older here, and that phase of his career is perhaps my favorite. This role was perfect for him, and he plays it marvelously. It is this Tracy I remember best. Joan Bennett plays Tracy's wife to a par. Perfect. I'm not a fan of the younger or the older Elizabeth Taylor, but at this age she was a gem, and this is one of her most endearing screen performances. You'll also recognize a number of character actors and actresses, including Billie Burke, Leo G. Carroll, Moroni Olsen, and Paul Harvey. I didn't recognize Russ Tamblyn as one of the sons, although it is a rather minor part. The plot here is simple -- all the real excitement, second thoughts, and planning of a wedding. That's what I mean about this being a real story. Done with light humor, but not a comedy. And excellent film and one deserving of a spot on your DVD shelf.

    I've watched this movie again recently, and I am now going to give it from a different perspective. This movie is very funny, it is very witty and funny! I laughed quite a lot at this movie, it is a very funny movie that is a great way to spend an evening! Is this one of the funniest movies I have ever seen? Yes. Is it a movie that would cause me to roll on the floor laughing? Possibly. Is it funny throughout the course of it? Yes. Is it a movie that once I see it, could I watch it again if I had the chance? Yes. So in short, this is one of the funniest movies ever made, it's a movie that I laughed at quite a lot! There are quite a lot of laughs in this movie, I would name them, but I don't want to spoil the movie for you if you decide to see it in the future. So on a scale from one to ten, one being the worst and ten being the best, I will give this movie a score of ten stars out of ten. So in short, it is not only one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time, it's one of the funniest movies of all time! Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor were hysterical in this movie, they were the best things about this movie, they were at their comedic best! What can make a movie a good movie are the lead actors. If the lead parts are being played by some great actors, then the movie will probably turn out to be good, just like how this one did! I would tell you more about this, but I don't want to spoil the movie for you. If you want to find out what happens, you will just have to take the time to see this movie for yourself. Because you can never really tell how good a movie is until you actually see it. Who knows, you might like it, you might not like it. I think that you will love it! So all in all, this is a gem of a movie, it truly is one of the greatest comedies of all time! If you haven't seen this movie yet, then you should see it, because you are probably going to be laughing at it quite a lot! It's great if you want to see just how funny a movie can possibly get! I mean really funny, this is a hilarious comedy that is a funny as it gets! Like I said before, you can't tell how good or bad a movie is going to be until you actually see it for yourself. When you do watch this movie, be prepared to laugh. So enjoy Father Of The Bride, because it is really funny! Watch it and have a great time laughing at it, because it certainly is a great time! 10/10

She complains to Pops that she wouldn't have the opportunity to display herself in all her evening apparel. Predictably, Buckley arrives and they fall into each other's arms. Clocking in at 94 nimble minutes, "Father of the Bride" qualifies as superior entertainment for the entire family. Incidentally, a sequel followed entitled "Father's Little Dividends" with Spencer Tracy and virtually the entire cast reprising their roles under the sure-handed direction of Vincente Minnelli. Other interesting scenes that stand out include the Coke scene in the kitchen when a younger man has to teach Spencer Tracy the correct way to remove the cap from a bottle of soda pop. Another cute scene involves an older Tracy trying to squeeze into his old cutaway suit. Although he manages to squeeze into it, Stanley later splits the seams in the back when he struggles to open two jammed door. Yes, Steve Martin stepped into Tracy's shoes for the 1991 remake and the 1995 sequel.

    For dad Spencer Tracy to get through meeting his daughter's intended through the wedding reception (where he is not even able to get a kiss from her, let alone the father/daughter dance), it is a tribute to his love and sobriety that he doesn't end up in A.A. He isn't so lucky at the meeting of the groom's parents, and at the announcement of the engagement, he doesn't get to make his speech, being too busy getting sprayed in the face with coke. It seems that you have to be under 25 to be able to open a bottle! Then, there's the 6 mint juleps, 4 bourbons, and tray of martinis he's made which nobody seems to want. This is a story of frustration, neglect and being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Desperate to see his kitten toss the bridal bouquet, Tracy tries to get through his own French doors and gets stuck in a crowd to rival the uptown train at Grand Central during rush hour. Having proved himself a top dramatic actor of the past two decades, he added comedy to his forte, first a series of romantic comedy's with Katharine Hepburn, then this magnificently funny film with Joan Bennett as the Myrna Loy like perfect wife and the gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor as the bride to be. Having made so many generic romantic comedy's, MGM must have been delightfully surprised by this one's tremendous success, both commercially and financially. The reason this one is so superb is that it takes on a different approach to a typical plot. By putting the event being seen through dad's eyes (isn't he the one always forgotten once he's walked the bride down the aisle?), screenwriters Hackett and Goodrich added in a type of comedy that dads everywhere (and their slightly guilty wives and daughters) could identify with. Tracy is delightfully deadpan, and isn't anywhere near perfect. He has a conniption fit when the wedding is moved from the house to a church, offers his daughter money to elope, and nervously steps back from the bride, fearful of falling. Bennett and Taylor allow Tracy to control the proceedings, making this a love letter to neglected wedding dads. Don Taylor is funny as the nervous groom, with Leo G. Carroll an effete wedding planner, so officious in his obvious distaste for all of the choices made and aghast at the house he has to re-arrange for the big event. Billie Burke and Moroni Olsen are amusing in their relatively minor roles as Taylor's parents. This is a humble production artistically, as it spoofs the pretensions of planning an event which really should be so personal and often is overstuffed like grand opera.

    First, a word about the main difference between this original story and the Steve Martin remake. The Steve Martin remake is a fine movie, but it is a comedy. The original is, in my view, a real story told with humor. I like both films, but in my view they are not really the same story. If you watch Spencer Tracy's films in order, you'll see him age rapidly in the second half of the 1940s. And here he has completed the transformation into a father figure...in this case a sort of "Father Knows Best" type of father. Yes, Tracy is getting older here, and that phase of his career is perhaps my favorite. This role was perfect for him, and he plays it marvelously. It is this Tracy I remember best. Joan Bennett plays Tracy's wife to a par. Perfect. I'm not a fan of the younger or the older Elizabeth Taylor, but at this age she was a gem, and this is one of her most endearing screen performances. You'll also recognize a number of character actors and actresses, including Billie Burke, Leo G. Carroll, Moroni Olsen, and Paul Harvey. I didn't recognize Russ Tamblyn as one of the sons, although it is a rather minor part. The plot here is simple -- all the real excitement, second thoughts, and planning of a wedding. That's what I mean about this being a real story. Done with light humor, but not a comedy. And excellent film and one deserving of a spot on your DVD shelf.

    I've watched this movie again recently, and I am now going to give it from a different perspective. This movie is very funny, it is very witty and funny! I laughed quite a lot at this movie, it is a very funny movie that is a great way to spend an evening! Is this one of the funniest movies I have ever seen? Yes. Is it a movie that would cause me to roll on the floor laughing? Possibly. Is it funny throughout the course of it? Yes. Is it a movie that once I see it, could I watch it again if I had the chance? Yes. So in short, this is one of the funniest movies ever made, it's a movie that I laughed at quite a lot! There are quite a lot of laughs in this movie, I would name them, but I don't want to spoil the movie for you if you decide to see it in the future. So on a scale from one to ten, one being the worst and ten being the best, I will give this movie a score of ten stars out of ten. So in short, it is not only one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time, it's one of the funniest movies of all time! Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor were hysterical in this movie, they were the best things about this movie, they were at their comedic best! What can make a movie a good movie are the lead actors. If the lead parts are being played by some great actors, then the movie will probably turn out to be good, just like how this one did! I would tell you more about this, but I don't want to spoil the movie for you. If you want to find out what happens, you will just have to take the time to see this movie for yourself. Because you can never really tell how good a movie is until you actually see it. Who knows, you might like it, you might not like it. I think that you will love it! So all in all, this is a gem of a movie, it truly is one of the greatest comedies of all time! If you haven't seen this movie yet, then you should see it, because you are probably going to be laughing at it quite a lot! It's great if you want to see just how funny a movie can possibly get! I mean really funny, this is a hilarious comedy that is a funny as it gets! Like I said before, you can't tell how good or bad a movie is going to be until you actually see it for yourself. When you do watch this movie, be prepared to laugh. So enjoy Father Of The Bride, because it is really funny! Watch it and have a great time laughing at it, because it certainly is a great time! 10/10

    For a while now, I have loved this movie. One or two scenes may feel unrealistic by today's standards, but so much compensates. The film does look very quaint and charming, I loved the style of the cinematography especially. The script is deliciously witty with Tracy getting the best lines, the story is immensely engaging and snappily paced and Vincente Minelli directs impeccably. The acting is also very good. Spencer Tracy is brilliant and gives one of the best performances of his career, while I have only seen one or two other films as of where Elizabeth Taylor looks as lovely as she is here. Overall, Father of the Bride is timeless. When it comes to the 1991 remake, it isn't as good but as far as remakes go it is not bad at all, quite the contrary. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    There's an old saying that the best ideas are the simplest. This is only partly true. The best ideas often stem from a basic concept, but one which yields wide-ranging and elaborate results, and then only if pulled off properly. Father of the Bride has a simple idea at its heart  a straightforward romantic comedy, told from the point of view of someone on the periphery of the romance. However that idea provides the basis for a neatly structured picture that is both funny and endearing. The screenplay, by the fantastic but rarely lauded husband-and-wife writing duo Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, tells a story on two levels. The actual events of the picture of chart the romance and wedding of a young couple, and this is more or less all that actually takes place on screen. However, the device of a voice-over narrative, as well as set-pieces such as the engagement party shown entirely from Spencer Tracy's position as involuntary butler, make this undoubtedly his story. The voice-over was a popular feature of thrillers around this time, but here it serves as a comical inner monologue and commentary. Telling the story through the father's eyes ultimately allows Goodrich and Hackett to make this a tale not of romantic love but of family and paternal affection, and one that is more moving than dozens of run-of-the-mill romcoms. Director Vincente Minnelli was perhaps an odd choice for this project. Having had his biggest successes with musicals, his flowing, flamboyant style could have been a bit over-the-top for such a small-scale real-world setting. However Minnelli's tendency to lead the audience in a certain direction, and his skillful control of elements within the frame bring a lot to Father of the Bride. He is careful to always keep the wedding story going, often literally in the background, while putting Spencer Tracy in the foreground to give us his expressions and reactions. Usually the background goings-on are very busy, helping them to balance out, as well as giving a better comedy effect as Tracy grumps about before the camera. In the scene where the Bankses meet the Dunstons, Minnelli begins successive shots with a close-up of Tracy's martini glass, to give the whole scene the overtone that he is getting more and more drunk as he speaks. One of Minnelli's brightest ideas is to shoot the chaotic wedding rehearsal in one long take from a distant high angle. Not only does this allow the comedy to unfold naturally, it introduces us to the setting but in a slightly detached way. This gives all the more contrast and intensity to the following nightmare sequence, which is all done in close-ups with dozens of cuts. In the titular role Spencer Tracy gives a typically engaging yet understated performance. This kind of thing was really Tracy's forte. He is essentially a comedy character, since it's his grouchiness and his bewilderment that underlie most of the funny bits. But he's not a wild comic  he's also very believable and very human, and more importantly someone we can like and sympathise with. Although Joan Bennett plays her role completely straight and very reserved, it makes sense for the two of them to be a screen couple. And while Katherine Hepburn had the best chemistry with Tracy and it was always nice to see them on screen together, Bennett is the more appropriate actress here, because she is more sedate and will not threaten to upstage Tracy, whose movie it is after all. And Elizabeth Taylor, a huge star even then and arguably the female lead, ultimately has a fairly marginal role both in the script and on the screen. Some commentators bemoan this fact, and even prefer the 1991 remake to this original as a result. And yet it is all organised in such a way  the Goodrich/Hackett screen writing, Minnelli's direction, Tracy's acting  that brings a depth and poignancy to the father-daughter relationship despite Taylor's minimal participation. Take moments such as Tracy's relieved smile as the camera pulls away with him from the young lovers' reunion after their argument, or his frantic searching for his daughter so he can say goodbye before she leaves for the honeymoon. They don't distract from the general pattern of this being the father's story, and yet they reveal his true feelings, sometimes better than many a conventional scene between two people who love each other.

    There are lots of ideas out there that give you fodder for a good comedic story,and the idea of a father having to let go of his "little girl" to marriage,as well as the potential financial strain of it all,is one of those that is ripe for the picking.Spencer Tracy is an excellent choice for the lead character in such a story.Who better than the young,lovely Liz Taylor as the daughter,herself a newlywed? This is indeed a funny film that works on all cylinders.My personal favorite moment has to be the dream sequence,with Tracy running late and unable to walk once he hits the aisle,and falling through the floor.Liz's scream at the end was hysterical.This is a classic comedy.I usually avoid remakes of classic films like this,but the 1991 remake to this film is just as worthy of your attention.Check them both out!

    After his daughter selects a mate, the father must endure sleepless nights, sticker shock, and the disruption of his household as he navigates through the nightmare of wedding planning. Tracy is terrific as the harried father whose plans for a small wedding go awry. As his wife and daughter, Bennett and Liz Taylor aren't given much to do except look supportive and lovely, respectively. Interestingly, both actresses played Amy in film versions of "Little Women," Bennett in 1933 and Taylor in 1949. Don Taylor, who plays the groom, would have a long career as a TV director. Minnelli does a nice job of balancing the comedy and the sentimentality.

    TCM is showing this movie for Father's Day and they are so right. I wish I had the kind of father's love Spencer Tracy had for his daughter. Joan Bennett is so beautiful she could have been Elizabeth Taylor's real mother. This is about the very rich family Banks in the 1950's giving their daughter a wedding (the wedding the mother always wanted but never had). The love expressed by this family and the family of the groom is beautiful. The groom's mother the wonderful Billie Burke the Good Witch of OZ is great!! It's in Black and White and you know I think it is better this way because you see the people not the sets not the glamour of the places and costumes but the reality of their emotions. The funnest part is the dream Spencer has before the wedding, then his sweet little talk with Elizabeth before the big day. I have always thought "Father of Bride" should be co-billed with "A Catered Affair" with Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine It's also about the daughter getting married (Debbie Reynolds as the girl) but this family are working class. Also great acting and a great story more true to real life of the 1950's. I submit Father of the Bride a 10 because when I come across this movie on TV either in the beginning or the middle or near the end I always stop and watch it. Every scene is a gem.

    i did enjoy this film,which was remade in 1991 with Steve Martin.this version is more of a romance than comedy,though there are a some comic bits that do work pretty well.this is the first movie movie i have seen with Spencer Tracy,and i kinda thought he overacted a bit at times.maybe that was intentional,i'm not sure.Steve Martin overacted in his version too,in my opinion.i find it amusing how back then in the 50's they weren't allowed to show a couple sleeping in the same bed,and of course there's a scene where the husband and wife are sleeping in separate beds in the same room,less than a foot away from each other.this trend continued into the 70's.anyway,for a pleasant diversion,you can't go wrong with this movie.for me,Father of the Bride (1950)is a 6/10

    "Father of the Bride" is such a flawless film that you cannot truly appreciate its artistry unless you watch it more than once. Splendidly cast, splendidly thesped, and perfectly hilarious without stooping to lowest common denominator humor to score points, this comedy was made when comedies could be funny without being stupid. Everything is told from the perspective of the eponymous character. Indeed, the entire movie constitutes a flashback as it opens with a disheveled Stanley Adams (Spencer Tracy) and his wife Ellie (Joan Bennett) sitting in the shambles of their house after their daughter Kay (Elizabeth Taylor) has been hitched to Buckley Dunstan (Don Taylor). Most of the comedy grows out of the predicaments that Tracy and company find themselves in when it comes time to throw a marriage for their daughter. For example, at the announcement of Kay's wedding, Stanley has planned a small speech, but he finds himself stuck in the kitchen of their house mixing drinks for the guests. When he finally gets a chance to get out of the kitchen and deliver his speech, everybody has left the premises. Later, Stanley has a nightmare about Kay's wedding; he dreams that he is trying to walk up the aisle, but the aisle turns into a surreal path and it is little for than a trampoline and our protagonist is struggling to keep his suit on no matter how rough the aisle becomes. At one point, when Buckley decides that Kay and he should honeymoon in Nova Scotia because the fishing is fantastic, Kay almost has the wedding canceled. She complains to Pops that she wouldn't have the opportunity to display herself in all her evening apparel. Predictably, Buckley arrives and they fall into each other's arms. Clocking in at 94 nimble minutes, "Father of the Bride" qualifies as superior entertainment for the entire family. Incidentally, a sequel followed entitled "Father's Little Dividends" with Spencer Tracy and virtually the entire cast reprising their roles under the sure-handed direction of Vincente Minnelli. Other interesting scenes that stand out include the Coke scene in the kitchen when a younger man has to teach Spencer Tracy the correct way to remove the cap from a bottle of soda pop. Another cute scene involves an older Tracy trying to squeeze into his old cutaway suit. Although he manages to squeeze into it, Stanley later splits the seams in the back when he struggles to open two jammed door. Yes, Steve Martin stepped into Tracy's shoes for the 1991 remake and the 1995 sequel.

In the scene where the Bankses meet the Dunstons, Minnelli begins successive shots with a close-up of Tracy's martini glass, to give the whole scene the overtone that he is getting more and more drunk as he speaks. One of Minnelli's brightest ideas is to shoot the chaotic wedding rehearsal in one long take from a distant high angle. Not only does this allow the comedy to unfold naturally, it introduces us to the setting but in a slightly detached way. This gives all the more contrast and intensity to the following nightmare sequence, which is all done in close-ups with dozens of cuts. In the titular role Spencer Tracy gives a typically engaging yet understated performance. This kind of thing was really Tracy's forte. He is essentially a comedy character, since it's his grouchiness and his bewilderment that underlie most of the funny bits. But he's not a wild comic  he's also very believable and very human, and more importantly someone we can like and sympathise with. Although Joan Bennett plays her role completely straight and very reserved, it makes sense for the two of them to be a screen couple. And while Katherine Hepburn had the best chemistry with Tracy and it was always nice to see them on screen together, Bennett is the more appropriate actress here, because she is more sedate and will not threaten to upstage Tracy, whose movie it is after all. And Elizabeth Taylor, a huge star even then and arguably the female lead, ultimately has a fairly marginal role both in the script and on the screen. Some commentators bemoan this fact, and even prefer the 1991 remake to this original as a result. And yet it is all organised in such a way  the Goodrich/Hackett screen writing, Minnelli's direction, Tracy's acting  that brings a depth and poignancy to the father-daughter relationship despite Taylor's minimal participation. Take moments such as Tracy's relieved smile as the camera pulls away with him from the young lovers' reunion after their argument, or his frantic searching for his daughter so he can say goodbye before she leaves for the honeymoon. They don't distract from the general pattern of this being the father's story, and yet they reveal his true feelings, sometimes better than many a conventional scene between two people who love each other.

    There are lots of ideas out there that give you fodder for a good comedic story,and the idea of a father having to let go of his "little girl" to marriage,as well as the potential financial strain of it all,is one of those that is ripe for the picking.Spencer Tracy is an excellent choice for the lead character in such a story.Who better than the young,lovely Liz Taylor as the daughter,herself a newlywed? This is indeed a funny film that works on all cylinders.My personal favorite moment has to be the dream sequence,with Tracy running late and unable to walk once he hits the aisle,and falling through the floor.Liz's scream at the end was hysterical.This is a classic comedy.I usually avoid remakes of classic films like this,but the 1991 remake to this film is just as worthy of your attention.Check them both out!

    After his daughter selects a mate, the father must endure sleepless nights, sticker shock, and the disruption of his household as he navigates through the nightmare of wedding planning. Tracy is terrific as the harried father whose plans for a small wedding go awry. As his wife and daughter, Bennett and Liz Taylor aren't given much to do except look supportive and lovely, respectively. Interestingly, both actresses played Amy in film versions of "Little Women," Bennett in 1933 and Taylor in 1949. Don Taylor, who plays the groom, would have a long career as a TV director. Minnelli does a nice job of balancing the comedy and the sentimentality.

    TCM is showing this movie for Father's Day and they are so right. I wish I had the kind of father's love Spencer Tracy had for his daughter. Joan Bennett is so beautiful she could have been Elizabeth Taylor's real mother. This is about the very rich family Banks in the 1950's giving their daughter a wedding (the wedding the mother always wanted but never had). The love expressed by this family and the family of the groom is beautiful. The groom's mother the wonderful Billie Burke the Good Witch of OZ is great!! It's in Black and White and you know I think it is better this way because you see the people not the sets not the glamour of the places and costumes but the reality of their emotions. The funnest part is the dream Spencer has before the wedding, then his sweet little talk with Elizabeth before the big day. I have always thought "Father of Bride" should be co-billed with "A Catered Affair" with Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine It's also about the daughter getting married (Debbie Reynolds as the girl) but this family are working class. Also great acting and a great story more true to real life of the 1950's. I submit Father of the Bride a 10 because when I come across this movie on TV either in the beginning or the middle or near the end I always stop and watch it. Every scene is a gem.

    i did enjoy this film,which was remade in 1991 with Steve Martin.this version is more of a romance than comedy,though there are a some comic bits that do work pretty well.this is the first movie movie i have seen with Spencer Tracy,and i kinda thought he overacted a bit at times.maybe that was intentional,i'm not sure.Steve Martin overacted in his version too,in my opinion.i find it amusing how back then in the 50's they weren't allowed to show a couple sleeping in the same bed,and of course there's a scene where the husband and wife are sleeping in separate beds in the same room,less than a foot away from each other.this trend continued into the 70's.anyway,for a pleasant diversion,you can't go wrong with this movie.for me,Father of the Bride (1950)is a 6/10
