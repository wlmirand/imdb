 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Paul is on one of his many business trips to Tokyo, as a computer-chip executive from New York, when he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman. Later, he finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, inadvertently interrupting an assassination by a feared Ninja-cult. As he is now the only man to have seen the face of the cult's warrior-leader and lived, he soon realizes that he is facing a markedly foreshortened life-expectancy. Teaming up with a friendly samurai couple, on a two-centuries-old blood-feud with the Ninja, he struggles to survive. Finally, recuperating on an island-fortress, he learns swordsmanship, and perhaps, a little about courage, honor, love, and loyalty. The requisite final confrontation is rife with bloody swordplay and spectacular martial-arts action sequences.

    Samurai movie with well staged scenes , colorful ambient , professionally directed and Japan set . The story starts with a quote by Daidoh Yuzan , 16th Century : &uml;One who is a Samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind . By day by night..the fact that he has to die&uml;. It deals with Paul (Christopher Lambert) a computer-chip executive from New York travels to Tokyo , there he finds a gorgeous Japanese girl (Joan Chen) . After that , he inadvertently interrupting his meeting by a killing . As he is now the only man to have seen the figure of the cult's warrior-chief (John Lone) named Makato and nobody has survived after seeing his face , as he soon realizes that he is taking on a markedly foreshortened life-expectancy . Then , he joins forces with a friendly samurai couple (Harada and Shimada) who helps him . Later on , at a speed train takes place a violent face off between Ninja-sect hoodlums and Sensei , his wife along with Paul ; the result is an astonishing massacre . Ultimately , Paul recuperating on an island-fortress and learning about life and sword-play . Finally , there occurs the definitive final duel between Ninjas from Makato clan and Takeda faction . This Ninja film packs bloody swordplay , spectacular martial-arts and noisy action sequences . This is a colourful , mostly filmed in Japan and medium budget movie ; leave no clich&eacute; untouched , though the rife fighting is magnificently staged . Amid the glamour of the scenarios is developed an intrigue about feud among Japanese factions , a two-centuries-old blood-confrontation with the Ninja and Takeda clan , including betrayal , crime and exploring the dark side of vengeance . Overwhelming and rousing fights with deadly use of Katanas , feet and palms , along with such weapons as swords , sticks , lances and &uml;Shuriken&uml;. It contains usual learning period in which the naive businessman learns a little about courage, honor, love, swordsmanship and loyalty . The picture is full of tumultuous sequences with frenetic action , surprises , climatic combats and groundbreaking struggles . Passable acting by Christopher Lambert as a businessman who finds himself struggling to survive in the wrong place at the wrong time , and John Lone is good as a feared Ninja chief . And enjoyable couple formed by Yoshio Harada as Takeda Sensei and Y&ocirc;ko Shimada as Mieko Takeda . Nice production design with exterior shots of the train were filmed on location on Japan, however, the interior shots were filmed on a set at Bridge Studios in Vancouver, B.C. ; the scenery rushing by outside the windows was simulated using large rotating drums with "blurred" scenery painted on it . Colorful cinematography by Jack Conroy , full of red shades and bright images . Monotonous and syncopated musical score by means of continuous drum sounds . The motion picture produced in moderated budget was well directed by J.F. Lawton, though with no originally . He wrote a number of feature film scripts including one called "Three Thousand", which was selected by the Sundance Institute , Touchstone Pictures purchased the script and later he changed the title to Pretty Woman (1990). He also wrote a script for Blankman (1994) , Chain reaction (1996) and DOA: Dead or Alive (2006), a film based on the huge video game series success of the same name . After that , he then wrote and directed Jackson (2008), a failed comedy-drama-musical . &uml;The hunted&uml; turns out to be one an acceptable film , including exciting attacks and groundbreaking fighting perfectly staged , the result is a strong entry for action buffs

    This movie has a lot of factors to recommend it and here they are: 1) The bullet train battle. One samurai and his wife take on a dozen ninjas aboard a passenger train. This scene must be seen to be believed, trust me. Which brings up another great feature: The samurai's wife loyally stands by his side no matter what he does, right or wrong, until the bitter end. She's just as capable and brave as he is, and is always right in the middle of all the action. He's not the stereotypical loner; he has a woman he can always count on. Also, the villain himself has a perverted version of this relationship; he too has a steadfast wife that he relies upon. 2) There's a lot of very adept writing throughout the film. Among some other excellent concepts, it also pays tribute to the Iliad (honest, it does) by using two major plot points from the ancient masterpiece. There's a skillfully done version of Hector killing Patroclus, who's disguised as Achilles; and of course the old Trojan Horse shows up at the end. 3) It subverts a lot of Hollywood clich&eacute;s. The white hero is injured, helpless and physically outmatched for almost the entire film, and he requires a lot of rescuing by some of the Japanese characters. When the white hero fights the villain, it's the villain who's badly wounded and exhausted, not the other way around as it usually is. For a change, the hero is the one who resorts to dirty tricks and improvisation to win. So it actually seems somewhat realistic that the hero could come out on top in this case. 4) The sword fights are quick and brutal and gruesome. It's all stabbing and slashing; not that constant parrying with the swords clanging off each other for ten minutes and no one gets hurt until the finish. 5) There's a distinct element of Japanese mysticism and superstition, but it's all very subtle and not obvious at all. There's a little bit of reference to curses and legends and so forth, but it isn't laid on too thick. The samurai picks up the wrong sword during the penultimate battle, and it costs him his life. Joan Chen's character supernaturally guides and aids the hero after her death, but it's never blatant. A young Japanese girl who is certainly her in spirit form (Lambert even refers to this girl as his "angel") saves him at the Pachinko arcade and later on she shows up as herself in a hallucination, which stays the villain's deadly hand just in the nick of time. Same as she watches over the hero, she also hexes the villain before her death and haunts him until his own end. It's a nice touch. 6) There's a faint undertone of attraction between the samurai's wife and the hero. The samurai even seems to give it his blessing as he's dying, when he orders her to survive her own wounds. Of course, she and the hero are the only ones still alive after the big battle sequence and it sure looks like they will hook up quite soon. 7) The acting is uniformly outstanding and exceptional by all the Asian actors and actresses. Christopher Lambert is one of the oddest movie stars ever; his acting is wooden and his accent is distracting, but he does somehow pull it off and makes a fine hero this time around. Anyway, this is a classic action flick and I can't recommend it highly enough. If you're like me and are fascinated by the concept of ninjas and samurai still secretly lurking about in the modern world, and of course doing battle with each other, then you need this one in your collection.

    Businessman Paul Racine (Christopher Lambert of Highlander fame) meets the lovely enigmatic Kirina (Twin Peak's Joan Chan) and has a one-night stand, however it's not all sunshine and lollipops as later that same night he inadvertently witnesses her execution and the perpetrators that did it send him to the hospital. The thing is that he's the only living person who has seen the ninja assassin's face and has lived, so now he's in mortal danger. He has to go on the run in a vain attempt to survive the inevitable onslaught upon him. I liked the fact that the movie stayed true to its characters and didn't let a businessman go all action hero on numerous highly trained ninjas, that would've rung out as false and a cop out. The film is also well acted and kept my rapt attention throughout, which is a big feat in and of itself. Eye Candy: Joan Chan gets topless; an unknown extra gets fully nude My Grade: B Where I saw it: Encore Action

    Thouh not a movie of captivating interest but has some good scenes. Especially train scene is marvelous.Suspense is arose after every important incident. Film has some flaws but these can be easily ignored. The performance of man with long hair and shining sword is impressive. Film can be watched but you must not compare it with classics like T2, Pulp Action. It is entirely different movie. I will give it at least six out of ten. You cannot be bored while watching it. It is the only movie in which I was able to tolerate Christopher. It is a bit more real in theme as compare to some idiot science fictions. I think if you want to see some good movie, it is a must see but I repeat again, do not expect much from the film. If you do not expect a standard of T2, Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings then it will do fairly well.

    Have you ever watched a samurai movie and thought: this would be so much better with Christopher Lambert in it? Probably not, but here's "The Hunted" anyway. And you know what, it's not too bad either. Lambert himself doesn't really get to do much fighting until the last fifteen minutes, but in the meantime his co-stars manage to squeeze out some truly impressive choreographies. I especially liked the train scene, which not only featured highly entertaining action but also the very quotable "is this Kinjooooo?". The ending isn't very believable all in all but hey, what kind of movie are we dealing with here? It doesn't exactly ruin the movie for me, mainly because it defines the movie. As for a conclusion uhm, how about: IS THIS KINJOOOO?

    When viewing "The Hunted" you wonder who this movie is meant for. It could not be action fans since the action scenes are horrible. Sure there is a lot of blood. But none of the fighters showed any extraordinary skill. Here you have this so called ninja who has to kill this woman (Joan Chen) and in stead of just doing so he takes his time and asks her how she wants to be killed. Not only that he even shows his face to her.(Which of course is always a big no no for an assassin.) You might think that he is a decent ninja. When she answers him to die slowly with a lot of pain he says he is under orders to do it quickly so he can't fulfill her request. And all this portrayed by the same man who played the last Emperor of China. Good god,and this is only in the first ten minutes. Christopher Lambert is a witness to this killing and has seen John Lone's face. These super skilled ninja's failed to kill him off and they chase him. Lambert gets help from a samurai but only to use him as bait. Now the most ridiculous thing is that everything is taken so seriously. But how could you. It is basically one silly scene to another. Lambert fans will be disappointed since he has more of a supporting role and only comes into action a couple of times.Do yourself a favor and forget about this movie!

    Christopher Lambert Japan ninja cult. Oh yeah! Ninja action with gratuitous sword combat with constant blood spray fills this trashy, but still very decent under the radar b-grade actioner. Paul Racine is an American businessman in Tokyo who one night encounters a mysterious Japanese lady in a bar where they would spend the night together, but accidentally he witnesses her death by some ninja assassins. Surviving the ordeal he finds himself on the run, as he has seen the face on the ninja leader which means he's a target. The (surprisingly) well-rounded story does seem to casually move from one fight after another (leaving some questionable and risible developments), but these moments do lack the flair and energy in the choreography to truly standout. It's more about the blistering grit which might not be a bad thing. One passage on a bullet train midway through is a real highlight though, showcasing a brutal and grisly onslaught of pure ferocity and excitement. Director J.F. Lawton polished handling is mechanically terse, by perfectly framing the strikingly lush and poignant Japanese backdrop with its fast pacing linking together a collection of tautly slick set-pieces as the chase is on. A sensually intoxicating eastern score really does match the scenes/vibe in a spiritual sense or complementing the imagery/or action. A husky sounding Lambert at first feels out of place in what starts off as a phoned-in performance, but eventually he grows in the role to leave behind his vulnerable state with a new act of courageousness (with the odd one or two smart arse quip) to face his inescapable fate. John Lone is great as the tenaciously relentless leader of the ninja assassins and Yoshio Harada's dry, but boldly commanding performance is the best of the lot as a samurai that takes in Lambert's character. Y&ocirc;ko Shimada, Masumi Okada and the beautiful Joan Chen are quite sound too. Entertaining slice of no-nonsense ninja fun.

    If you are a fan of action films, like the kind Steven Segal is usually seen in, this one is for you. The movie cast is superb with veteran actor John Lone, playing Kinjo. He is usually a good guy but most recently is seen wearing black hats. His acting is incredible as is Yoshio Harada who plays Takeda, a master of Kendo or combat art. Another actor who is more famous for his 'Highlander' series is Christopher Lambert who plays Paul Racine. Adding sympathy, compassion and remarkable loyalty is Joan Chen who plays Kirina. The story is of a businessman who happens to be at the wrong place, when he witnesses a Japanese woman being murdered. Although he is severely wounded, the assassins do not kill him as instructed, but allow him to become a pawn in a thousand year old feud between two rival clans. The drama is top notch, the sword action is exciting and extremely good considering it's set in modern Japan. The element of spiritual combat is well blended with good old fashion martial arts. Recommended for anyone seeking a fine film. ****

    I believe liked this movie The Hunted better ten years ago, when I saw part of it on television. Despite I like watching movies uncut, I was that much younger. This was not a bad movie, I found it be all right. It was about an American businessman Paul Racine witnessing a murder of a local Japanese woman. The Ninja Cult attempted to kill Racine, and after learning of Racine's survival, they were out to finish the job. Today, I told a friend about this movie, and he thought of it as a comedy. If anyone seen this movie and saw the great lengths and amount of people, they will kill in order get to their target, they would not find it to be so funny. I recommend to this movie to anyone who likes intensity.

    People should realize there is a difference between ninja movies and action movies. They aren't necessarily one and the same. And this, my friends, is a ninja movie. Sure, there are fights and violence to be found, but they don't give a 'Hollywood' feel to it. Especially the train scene comes to mind, where the ninja's decide to kill everybody in order to leave no witnesses. It's calculated, and it gives a sense of murder and terrorism to it instead of action. The victims aren't generic enemies, they're real people. A lot of care is put into the realism. Cops show up after a murder scene to investigate. How often have we seen a ninja movie where ninja's or people are killed, without that ever happening? The whole movie involves ploy and strategy, leading to the fight scenes. Christopher Lambert receives sword training and his enemy is wounded before the final fight, to give Lambert a realistic underdog chance to win. There's nothing 'romantic' about his training like, say, Van Damme in kickboxer. Lambert is scared and clinging to every edge he can find to live, whilst most of the samurai consider him worthless. I first went into this movie expecting an action flick, and was disappointed. Then, I watched it again, and realized it was great. The movie deserves credit for staying true to the formula.

    This movie has a lot of factors to recommend it and here they are: 1) The bullet train battle. One samurai and his wife take on a dozen ninjas aboard a passenger train.

She's just as capable and brave as he is, and is always right in the middle of all the action. He's not the stereotypical loner; he has a woman he can always count on.

The ending isn't very believable all in all but hey, what kind of movie are we dealing with here? It doesn't exactly ruin the movie for me, mainly because it defines the movie. As for a conclusion uhm, how about: IS THIS KINJOOOO?

    When viewing "The Hunted" you wonder who this movie is meant for. It could not be action fans since the action scenes are horrible. Sure there is a lot of blood. But none of the fighters showed any extraordinary skill. Here you have this so called ninja who has to kill this woman (Joan Chen) and in stead of just doing so he takes his time and asks her how she wants to be killed. Not only that he even shows his face to her.(Which of course is always a big no no for an assassin.) You might think that he is a decent ninja. When she answers him to die slowly with a lot of pain he says he is under orders to do it quickly so he can't fulfill her request. And all this portrayed by the same man who played the last Emperor of China. Good god,and this is only in the first ten minutes. Christopher Lambert is a witness to this killing and has seen John Lone's face. These super skilled ninja's failed to kill him off and they chase him. Lambert gets help from a samurai but only to use him as bait. Now the most ridiculous thing is that everything is taken so seriously. But how could you. It is basically one silly scene to another. Lambert fans will be disappointed since he has more of a supporting role and only comes into action a couple of times.Do yourself a favor and forget about this movie!

    Christopher Lambert Japan ninja cult. Oh yeah! Ninja action with gratuitous sword combat with constant blood spray fills this trashy, but still very decent under the radar b-grade actioner. Paul Racine is an American businessman in Tokyo who one night encounters a mysterious Japanese lady in a bar where they would spend the night together, but accidentally he witnesses her death by some ninja assassins. Surviving the ordeal he finds himself on the run, as he has seen the face on the ninja leader which means he's a target. The (surprisingly) well-rounded story does seem to casually move from one fight after another (leaving some questionable and risible developments), but these moments do lack the flair and energy in the choreography to truly standout. It's more about the blistering grit which might not be a bad thing. One passage on a bullet train midway through is a real highlight though, showcasing a brutal and grisly onslaught of pure ferocity and excitement. Director J.F. Lawton polished handling is mechanically terse, by perfectly framing the strikingly lush and poignant Japanese backdrop with its fast pacing linking together a collection of tautly slick set-pieces as the chase is on. A sensually intoxicating eastern score really does match the scenes/vibe in a spiritual sense or complementing the imagery/or action. A husky sounding Lambert at first feels out of place in what starts off as a phoned-in performance, but eventually he grows in the role to leave behind his vulnerable state with a new act of courageousness (with the odd one or two smart arse quip) to face his inescapable fate. John Lone is great as the tenaciously relentless leader of the ninja assassins and Yoshio Harada's dry, but boldly commanding performance is the best of the lot as a samurai that takes in Lambert's character. Y&ocirc;ko Shimada, Masumi Okada and the beautiful Joan Chen are quite sound too. Entertaining slice of no-nonsense ninja fun.

    If you are a fan of action films, like the kind Steven Segal is usually seen in, this one is for you. The movie cast is superb with veteran actor John Lone, playing Kinjo. He is usually a good guy but most recently is seen wearing black hats. His acting is incredible as is Yoshio Harada who plays Takeda, a master of Kendo or combat art. Another actor who is more famous for his 'Highlander' series is Christopher Lambert who plays Paul Racine. Adding sympathy, compassion and remarkable loyalty is Joan Chen who plays Kirina. The story is of a businessman who happens to be at the wrong place, when he witnesses a Japanese woman being murdered. Although he is severely wounded, the assassins do not kill him as instructed, but allow him to become a pawn in a thousand year old feud between two rival clans. The drama is top notch, the sword action is exciting and extremely good considering it's set in modern Japan. The element of spiritual combat is well blended with good old fashion martial arts. Recommended for anyone seeking a fine film. ****

    I believe liked this movie The Hunted better ten years ago, when I saw part of it on television. Despite I like watching movies uncut, I was that much younger. This was not a bad movie, I found it be all right. It was about an American businessman Paul Racine witnessing a murder of a local Japanese woman. The Ninja Cult attempted to kill Racine, and after learning of Racine's survival, they were out to finish the job. Today, I told a friend about this movie, and he thought of it as a comedy. If anyone seen this movie and saw the great lengths and amount of people, they will kill in order get to their target, they would not find it to be so funny. I recommend to this movie to anyone who likes intensity.

    People should realize there is a difference between ninja movies and action movies. They aren't necessarily one and the same. And this, my friends, is a ninja movie. Sure, there are fights and violence to be found, but they don't give a 'Hollywood' feel to it. Especially the train scene comes to mind, where the ninja's decide to kill everybody in order to leave no witnesses. It's calculated, and it gives a sense of murder and terrorism to it instead of action. The victims aren't generic enemies, they're real people. A lot of care is put into the realism. Cops show up after a murder scene to investigate. How often have we seen a ninja movie where ninja's or people are killed, without that ever happening? The whole movie involves ploy and strategy, leading to the fight scenes. Christopher Lambert receives sword training and his enemy is wounded before the final fight, to give Lambert a realistic underdog chance to win. There's nothing 'romantic' about his training like, say, Van Damme in kickboxer. Lambert is scared and clinging to every edge he can find to live, whilst most of the samurai consider him worthless. I first went into this movie expecting an action flick, and was disappointed. Then, I watched it again, and realized it was great. The movie deserves credit for staying true to the formula.

    Samurai movie with well staged scenes , colorful ambient , professionally directed and Japan set . The story starts with a quote by Daidoh Yuzan , 16th Century : &uml;One who is a Samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind . By day by night..the fact that he has to die&uml;. It deals with Paul (Christopher Lambert) a computer-chip executive from New York travels to Tokyo , there he finds a gorgeous Japanese girl (Joan Chen) . After that , he inadvertently interrupting his meeting by a killing . As he is now the only man to have seen the figure of the cult's warrior-chief (John Lone) named Makato and nobody has survived after seeing his face , as he soon realizes that he is taking on a markedly foreshortened life-expectancy . Then , he joins forces with a friendly samurai couple (Harada and Shimada) who helps him . Later on , at a speed train takes place a violent face off between Ninja-sect hoodlums and Sensei , his wife along with Paul ; the result is an astonishing massacre . Ultimately , Paul recuperating on an island-fortress and learning about life and sword-play . Finally , there occurs the definitive final duel between Ninjas from Makato clan and Takeda faction . This Ninja film packs bloody swordplay , spectacular martial-arts and noisy action sequences . This is a colourful , mostly filmed in Japan and medium budget movie ; leave no clich&eacute; untouched , though the rife fighting is magnificently staged . Amid the glamour of the scenarios is developed an intrigue about feud among Japanese factions , a two-centuries-old blood-confrontation with the Ninja and Takeda clan , including betrayal , crime and exploring the dark side of vengeance . Overwhelming and rousing fights with deadly use of Katanas , feet and palms , along with such weapons as swords , sticks , lances and &uml;Shuriken&uml;. It contains usual learning period in which the naive businessman learns a little about courage, honor, love, swordsmanship and loyalty . The picture is full of tumultuous sequences with frenetic action , surprises , climatic combats and groundbreaking struggles . Passable acting by Christopher Lambert as a businessman who finds himself struggling to survive in the wrong place at the wrong time , and John Lone is good as a feared Ninja chief . And enjoyable couple formed by Yoshio Harada as Takeda Sensei and Y&ocirc;ko Shimada as Mieko Takeda . Nice production design with exterior shots of the train were filmed on location on Japan, however, the interior shots were filmed on a set at Bridge Studios in Vancouver, B.C. ; the scenery rushing by outside the windows was simulated using large rotating drums with "blurred" scenery painted on it . Colorful cinematography by Jack Conroy , full of red shades and bright images . Monotonous and syncopated musical score by means of continuous drum sounds . The motion picture produced in moderated budget was well directed by J.F. Lawton, though with no originally . He wrote a number of feature film scripts including one called "Three Thousand", which was selected by the Sundance Institute , Touchstone Pictures purchased the script and later he changed the title to Pretty Woman (1990). He also wrote a script for Blankman (1994) , Chain reaction (1996) and DOA: Dead or Alive (2006), a film based on the huge video game series success of the same name . After that , he then wrote and directed Jackson (2008), a failed comedy-drama-musical . &uml;The hunted&uml; turns out to be one an acceptable film , including exciting attacks and groundbreaking fighting perfectly staged , the result is a strong entry for action buffs

    This movie has a lot of factors to recommend it and here they are: 1) The bullet train battle. One samurai and his wife take on a dozen ninjas aboard a passenger train. This scene must be seen to be believed, trust me. Which brings up another great feature: The samurai's wife loyally stands by his side no matter what he does, right or wrong, until the bitter end. She's just as capable and brave as he is, and is always right in the middle of all the action. He's not the stereotypical loner; he has a woman he can always count on. Also, the villain himself has a perverted version of this relationship; he too has a steadfast wife that he relies upon. 2) There's a lot of very adept writing throughout the film. Among some other excellent concepts, it also pays tribute to the Iliad (honest, it does) by using two major plot points from the ancient masterpiece. There's a skillfully done version of Hector killing Patroclus, who's disguised as Achilles; and of course the old Trojan Horse shows up at the end. 3) It subverts a lot of Hollywood clich&eacute;s. The white hero is injured, helpless and physically outmatched for almost the entire film, and he requires a lot of rescuing by some of the Japanese characters. When the white hero fights the villain, it's the villain who's badly wounded and exhausted, not the other way around as it usually is. For a change, the hero is the one who resorts to dirty tricks and improvisation to win. So it actually seems somewhat realistic that the hero could come out on top in this case. 4) The sword fights are quick and brutal and gruesome. It's all stabbing and slashing; not that constant parrying with the swords clanging off each other for ten minutes and no one gets hurt until the finish. 5) There's a distinct element of Japanese mysticism and superstition, but it's all very subtle and not obvious at all. There's a little bit of reference to curses and legends and so forth, but it isn't laid on too thick. The samurai picks up the wrong sword during the penultimate battle, and it costs him his life. Joan Chen's character supernaturally guides and aids the hero after her death, but it's never blatant. A young Japanese girl who is certainly her in spirit form (Lambert even refers to this girl as his "angel") saves him at the Pachinko arcade and later on she shows up as herself in a hallucination, which stays the villain's deadly hand just in the nick of time. Same as she watches over the hero, she also hexes the villain before her death and haunts him until his own end. It's a nice touch. 6) There's a faint undertone of attraction between the samurai's wife and the hero. The samurai even seems to give it his blessing as he's dying, when he orders her to survive her own wounds. Of course, she and the hero are the only ones still alive after the big battle sequence and it sure looks like they will hook up quite soon. 7) The acting is uniformly outstanding and exceptional by all the Asian actors and actresses. Christopher Lambert is one of the oddest movie stars ever; his acting is wooden and his accent is distracting, but he does somehow pull it off and makes a fine hero this time around. Anyway, this is a classic action flick and I can't recommend it highly enough. If you're like me and are fascinated by the concept of ninjas and samurai still secretly lurking about in the modern world, and of course doing battle with each other, then you need this one in your collection.

    Businessman Paul Racine (Christopher Lambert of Highlander fame) meets the lovely enigmatic Kirina (Twin Peak's Joan Chan) and has a one-night stand, however it's not all sunshine and lollipops as later that same night he inadvertently witnesses her execution and the perpetrators that did it send him to the hospital. The thing is that he's the only living person who has seen the ninja assassin's face and has lived, so now he's in mortal danger. He has to go on the run in a vain attempt to survive the inevitable onslaught upon him. I liked the fact that the movie stayed true to its characters and didn't let a businessman go all action hero on numerous highly trained ninjas, that would've rung out as false and a cop out. The film is also well acted and kept my rapt attention throughout, which is a big feat in and of itself. Eye Candy: Joan Chan gets topless; an unknown extra gets fully nude My Grade: B Where I saw it: Encore Action

    Thouh not a movie of captivating interest but has some good scenes. Especially train scene is marvelous.Suspense is arose after every important incident. Film has some flaws but these can be easily ignored. The performance of man with long hair and shining sword is impressive. Film can be watched but you must not compare it with classics like T2, Pulp Action. It is entirely different movie. I will give it at least six out of ten. You cannot be bored while watching it. It is the only movie in which I was able to tolerate Christopher. It is a bit more real in theme as compare to some idiot science fictions. I think if you want to see some good movie, it is a must see but I repeat again, do not expect much from the film. If you do not expect a standard of T2, Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings then it will do fairly well.

    This movie has a lot of factors to recommend it and here they are: 1) The bullet train battle. One samurai and his wife take on a dozen ninjas aboard a passenger train. This scene must be seen to be believed, trust me. Which brings up another great feature: The samurai's wife loyally stands by his side no matter what he does, right or wrong, until the bitter end. She's just as capable and brave as he is, and is always right in the middle of all the action. He's not the stereotypical loner; he has a woman he can always count on. Also, the villain himself has a perverted version of this relationship; he too has a steadfast wife that he relies upon. 2) There's a lot of very adept writing throughout the film. Among some other excellent concepts, it also pays tribute to the Iliad (honest, it does) by using two major plot points from the ancient masterpiece. There's a skillfully done version of Hector killing Patroclus, who's disguised as Achilles; and of course the old Trojan Horse shows up at the end. 3) It subverts a lot of Hollywood clich&eacute;s. The white hero is injured, helpless and physically outmatched for almost the entire film, and he requires a lot of rescuing by some of the Japanese characters. When the white hero fights the villain, it's the villain who's badly wounded and exhausted, not the other way around as it usually is. For a change, the hero is the one who resorts to dirty tricks and improvisation to win. So it actually seems somewhat realistic that the hero could come out on top in this case. 4) The sword fights are quick and brutal and gruesome. It's all stabbing and slashing; not that constant parrying with the swords clanging off each other for ten minutes and no one gets hurt until the finish. 5) There's a distinct element of Japanese mysticism and superstition, but it's all very subtle and not obvious at all. There's a little bit of reference to curses and legends and so forth, but it isn't laid on too thick. The samurai picks up the wrong sword during the penultimate battle, and it costs him his life. Joan Chen's character supernaturally guides and aids the hero after her death, but it's never blatant. A young Japanese girl who is certainly her in spirit form (Lambert even refers to this girl as his "angel") saves him at the Pachinko arcade and later on she shows up as herself in a hallucination, which stays the villain's deadly hand just in the nick of time. Same as she watches over the hero, she also hexes the villain before her death and haunts him until his own end. It's a nice touch. 6) There's a faint undertone of attraction between the samurai's wife and the hero. The samurai even seems to give it his blessing as he's dying, when he orders her to survive her own wounds. Of course, she and the hero are the only ones still alive after the big battle sequence and it sure looks like they will hook up quite soon. 7) The acting is uniformly outstanding and exceptional by all the Asian actors and actresses. Christopher Lambert is one of the oddest movie stars ever; his acting is wooden and his accent is distracting, but he does somehow pull it off and makes a fine hero this time around. Anyway, this is a classic action flick and I can't recommend it highly enough. If you're like me and are fascinated by the concept of ninjas and samurai still secretly lurking about in the modern world, and of course doing battle with each other, then you need this one in your collection.

    Businessman Paul Racine (Christopher Lambert of Highlander fame) meets the lovely enigmatic Kirina (Twin Peak's Joan Chan) and has a one-night stand, however it's not all sunshine and lollipops as later that same night he inadvertently witnesses her execution and the perpetrators that did it send him to the hospital. The thing is that he's the only living person who has seen the ninja assassin's face and has lived, so now he's in mortal danger. He has to go on the run in a vain attempt to survive the inevitable onslaught upon him. I liked the fact that the movie stayed true to its characters and didn't let a businessman go all action hero on numerous highly trained ninjas, that would've rung out as false and a cop out. The film is also well acted and kept my rapt attention throughout, which is a big feat in and of itself. Eye Candy: Joan Chan gets topless; an unknown extra gets fully nude My Grade: B Where I saw it: Encore Action

    Thouh not a movie of captivating interest but has some good scenes. Especially train scene is marvelous.Suspense is arose after every important incident. Film has some flaws but these can be easily ignored. The performance of man with long hair and shining sword is impressive. Film can be watched but you must not compare it with classics like T2, Pulp Action. It is entirely different movie. I will give it at least six out of ten. You cannot be bored while watching it. It is the only movie in which I was able to tolerate Christopher. It is a bit more real in theme as compare to some idiot science fictions. I think if you want to see some good movie, it is a must see but I repeat again, do not expect much from the film. If you do not expect a standard of T2, Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings then it will do fairly well.

    Have you ever watched a samurai movie and thought: this would be so much better with Christopher Lambert in it? Probably not, but here's "The Hunted" anyway. And you know what, it's not too bad either. Lambert himself doesn't really get to do much fighting until the last fifteen minutes, but in the meantime his co-stars manage to squeeze out some truly impressive choreographies. I especially liked the train scene, which not only featured highly entertaining action but also the very quotable "is this Kinjooooo?". The ending isn't very believable all in all but hey, what kind of movie are we dealing with here? It doesn't exactly ruin the movie for me, mainly because it defines the movie. As for a conclusion uhm, how about: IS THIS KINJOOOO?

    When viewing "The Hunted" you wonder who this movie is meant for. It could not be action fans since the action scenes are horrible. Sure there is a lot of blood. But none of the fighters showed any extraordinary skill. Here you have this so called ninja who has to kill this woman (Joan Chen) and in stead of just doing so he takes his time and asks her how she wants to be killed. Not only that he even shows his face to her.(Which of course is always a big no no for an assassin.) You might think that he is a decent ninja. When she answers him to die slowly with a lot of pain he says he is under orders to do it quickly so he can't fulfill her request. And all this portrayed by the same man who played the last Emperor of China. Good god,and this is only in the first ten minutes. Christopher Lambert is a witness to this killing and has seen John Lone's face. These super skilled ninja's failed to kill him off and they chase him. Lambert gets help from a samurai but only to use him as bait. Now the most ridiculous thing is that everything is taken so seriously. But how could you. It is basically one silly scene to another. Lambert fans will be disappointed since he has more of a supporting role and only comes into action a couple of times.Do yourself a favor and forget about this movie!

    Christopher Lambert Japan ninja cult. Oh yeah! Ninja action with gratuitous sword combat with constant blood spray fills this trashy, but still very decent under the radar b-grade actioner. Paul Racine is an American businessman in Tokyo who one night encounters a mysterious Japanese lady in a bar where they would spend the night together, but accidentally he witnesses her death by some ninja assassins. Surviving the ordeal he finds himself on the run, as he has seen the face on the ninja leader which means he's a target. The (surprisingly) well-rounded story does seem to casually move from one fight after another (leaving some questionable and risible developments), but these moments do lack the flair and energy in the choreography to truly standout. It's more about the blistering grit which might not be a bad thing. One passage on a bullet train midway through is a real highlight though, showcasing a brutal and grisly onslaught of pure ferocity and excitement. Director J.F. Lawton polished handling is mechanically terse, by perfectly framing the strikingly lush and poignant Japanese backdrop with its fast pacing linking together a collection of tautly slick set-pieces as the chase is on. A sensually intoxicating eastern score really does match the scenes/vibe in a spiritual sense or complementing the imagery/or action. A husky sounding Lambert at first feels out of place in what starts off as a phoned-in performance, but eventually he grows in the role to leave behind his vulnerable state with a new act of courageousness (with the odd one or two smart arse quip) to face his inescapable fate. John Lone is great as the tenaciously relentless leader of the ninja assassins and Yoshio Harada's dry, but boldly commanding performance is the best of the lot as a samurai that takes in Lambert's character. Y&ocirc;ko Shimada, Masumi Okada and the beautiful Joan Chen are quite sound too. Entertaining slice of no-nonsense ninja fun.

    If you are a fan of action films, like the kind Steven Segal is usually seen in, this one is for you. The movie cast is superb with veteran actor John Lone, playing Kinjo. He is usually a good guy but most recently is seen wearing black hats. His acting is incredible as is Yoshio Harada who plays Takeda, a master of Kendo or combat art. Another actor who is more famous for his 'Highlander' series is Christopher Lambert who plays Paul Racine. Adding sympathy, compassion and remarkable loyalty is Joan Chen who plays Kirina. The story is of a businessman who happens to be at the wrong place, when he witnesses a Japanese woman being murdered. Although he is severely wounded, the assassins do not kill him as instructed, but allow him to become a pawn in a thousand year old feud between two rival clans. The drama is top notch, the sword action is exciting and extremely good considering it's set in modern Japan. The element of spiritual combat is well blended with good old fashion martial arts. Recommended for anyone seeking a fine film. ****

    I believe liked this movie The Hunted better ten years ago, when I saw part of it on television. Despite I like watching movies uncut, I was that much younger. This was not a bad movie, I found it be all right. It was about an American businessman Paul Racine witnessing a murder of a local Japanese woman. The Ninja Cult attempted to kill Racine, and after learning of Racine's survival, they were out to finish the job. Today, I told a friend about this movie, and he thought of it as a comedy. If anyone seen this movie and saw the great lengths and amount of people, they will kill in order get to their target, they would not find it to be so funny. I recommend to this movie to anyone who likes intensity.

    People should realize there is a difference between ninja movies and action movies. They aren't necessarily one and the same. And this, my friends, is a ninja movie. Sure, there are fights and violence to be found, but they don't give a 'Hollywood' feel to it. Especially the train scene comes to mind, where the ninja's decide to kill everybody in order to leave no witnesses. It's calculated, and it gives a sense of murder and terrorism to it instead of action. The victims aren't generic enemies, they're real people. A lot of care is put into the realism. Cops show up after a murder scene to investigate. How often have we seen a ninja movie where ninja's or people are killed, without that ever happening? The whole movie involves ploy and strategy, leading to the fight scenes. Christopher Lambert receives sword training and his enemy is wounded before the final fight, to give Lambert a realistic underdog chance to win. There's nothing 'romantic' about his training like, say, Van Damme in kickboxer. Lambert is scared and clinging to every edge he can find to live, whilst most of the samurai consider him worthless. I first went into this movie expecting an action flick, and was disappointed. Then, I watched it again, and realized it was great. The movie deserves credit for staying true to the formula.

    Samurai movie with well staged scenes , colorful ambient , professionally directed and Japan set . The story starts with a quote by Daidoh Yuzan , 16th Century : &uml;One who is a Samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind . By day by night..the fact that he has to die&uml;. It deals with Paul (Christopher Lambert) a computer-chip executive from New York travels to Tokyo , there he finds a gorgeous Japanese girl (Joan Chen) . After that , he inadvertently interrupting his meeting by a killing . As he is now the only man to have seen the figure of the cult's warrior-chief (John Lone) named Makato and nobody has survived after seeing his face , as he soon realizes that he is taking on a markedly foreshortened life-expectancy . Then , he joins forces with a friendly samurai couple (Harada and Shimada) who helps him . Later on , at a speed train takes place a violent face off between Ninja-sect hoodlums and Sensei , his wife along with Paul ; the result is an astonishing massacre . Ultimately , Paul recuperating on an island-fortress and learning about life and sword-play . Finally , there occurs the definitive final duel between Ninjas from Makato clan and Takeda faction . This Ninja film packs bloody swordplay , spectacular martial-arts and noisy action sequences . This is a colourful , mostly filmed in Japan and medium budget movie ; leave no clich&eacute; untouched , though the rife fighting is magnificently staged . Amid the glamour of the scenarios is developed an intrigue about feud among Japanese factions , a two-centuries-old blood-confrontation with the Ninja and Takeda clan , including betrayal , crime and exploring the dark side of vengeance . Overwhelming and rousing fights with deadly use of Katanas , feet and palms , along with such weapons as swords , sticks , lances and &uml;Shuriken&uml;. It contains usual learning period in which the naive businessman learns a little about courage, honor, love, swordsmanship and loyalty . The picture is full of tumultuous sequences with frenetic action , surprises , climatic combats and groundbreaking struggles . Passable acting by Christopher Lambert as a businessman who finds himself struggling to survive in the wrong place at the wrong time , and John Lone is good as a feared Ninja chief . And enjoyable couple formed by Yoshio Harada as Takeda Sensei and Y&ocirc;ko Shimada as Mieko Takeda . Nice production design with exterior shots of the train were filmed on location on Japan, however, the interior shots were filmed on a set at Bridge Studios in Vancouver, B.C. ; the scenery rushing by outside the windows was simulated using large rotating drums with "blurred" scenery painted on it . Colorful cinematography by Jack Conroy , full of red shades and bright images . Monotonous and syncopated musical score by means of continuous drum sounds . The motion picture produced in moderated budget was well directed by J.F. Lawton, though with no originally . He wrote a number of feature film scripts including one called "Three Thousand", which was selected by the Sundance Institute , Touchstone Pictures purchased the script and later he changed the title to Pretty Woman (1990). He also wrote a script for Blankman (1994) , Chain reaction (1996) and DOA: Dead or Alive (2006), a film based on the huge video game series success of the same name . After that , he then wrote and directed Jackson (2008), a failed comedy-drama-musical . &uml;The hunted&uml; turns out to be one an acceptable film , including exciting attacks and groundbreaking fighting perfectly staged , the result is a strong entry for action buffs

    This movie has a lot of factors to recommend it and here they are: 1) The bullet train battle. One samurai and his wife take on a dozen ninjas aboard a passenger train. This scene must be seen to be believed, trust me. Which brings up another great feature: The samurai's wife loyally stands by his side no matter what he does, right or wrong, until the bitter end. She's just as capable and brave as he is, and is always right in the middle of all the action. He's not the stereotypical loner; he has a woman he can always count on. Also, the villain himself has a perverted version of this relationship; he too has a steadfast wife that he relies upon. 2) There's a lot of very adept writing throughout the film. Among some other excellent concepts, it also pays tribute to the Iliad (honest, it does) by using two major plot points from the ancient masterpiece. There's a skillfully done version of Hector killing Patroclus, who's disguised as Achilles; and of course the old Trojan Horse shows up at the end. 3) It subverts a lot of Hollywood clich&eacute;s. The white hero is injured, helpless and physically outmatched for almost the entire film, and he requires a lot of rescuing by some of the Japanese characters. When the white hero fights the villain, it's the villain who's badly wounded and exhausted, not the other way around as it usually is. For a change, the hero is the one who resorts to dirty tricks and improvisation to win. So it actually seems somewhat realistic that the hero could come out on top in this case. 4) The sword fights are quick and brutal and gruesome. It's all stabbing and slashing; not that constant parrying with the swords clanging off each other for ten minutes and no one gets hurt until the finish. 5) There's a distinct element of Japanese mysticism and superstition, but it's all very subtle and not obvious at all. There's a little bit of reference to curses and legends and so forth, but it isn't laid on too thick. The samurai picks up the wrong sword during the penultimate battle, and it costs him his life. Joan Chen's character supernaturally guides and aids the hero after her death, but it's never blatant.

Anyway, this is a classic action flick and I can't recommend it highly enough.

Christopher Lambert receives sword training and his enemy is wounded before the final fight, to give Lambert a realistic underdog chance to win. There's nothing 'romantic' about his training like, say, Van Damme in kickboxer. Lambert is scared and clinging to every edge he can find to live, whilst most of the samurai consider him worthless. I first went into this movie expecting an action flick, and was disappointed. Then, I watched it again, and realized it was great. The movie deserves credit for staying true to the formula.
