 <storyline>
  Russia, 1936: revolutionary hero Colonel Kotov is spending an idyllic summer in his dacha with his young wife and six-year-old daughter Nadia and other assorted family and friends. Things change dramatically with the unheralded arrival of Cousin Dmitri from Moscow, who charms the women and little Nadia with his games and pianistic bravura. But Kotov isn't fooled: this is the time of Stalin's repression, with telephone calls in the middle of the night spelling doom - and he knows that Dmitri isn't paying a social call...

    Finally KGB colonel Mihalkov shows his real face ! In this awful movie, we see a good (!?!?) Bolshevik colonel, in... 1936 ! Since 1933 till 1936, only in Ukraine, more than THREE MILLIONS died by starvation, because of these 'good' or bad Bolsheviks ! How many of the Russian elite died in the so called 'revolution' and the years that follows ? Ten millions ? 15 ? 20 millions ? How many Baltics, Moldavians, Caucasians or central Asia people died in Siberia camps, Ural or Arctic mines ? How many hundreds thousands of land workers, engineers, teachers, lawyers ? All the high Bolsheviks were bloody criminals, without exception, starting with Lenin, Trotski or Stalin. See also their children: Mao, Kim Ir Sen, Fidel, Ceausescu, Enver Hodja, Pol Pot etc etc. Try 2 serious movies about the reds: Soviet Story, 2008 or Katyn, 2007.

    Burnt by the Sun is a fantastically made film, focusing on the injustices of Stalin. It details the arrest of a Russian Civil War veteran, Sergei Petrovich Kotov. At 135 minutes, some will say that the movie runs long but I disagree. While the plot does not really begin until the second half, the extra time is not wasted on viewers. We see much of Kotov, his family, and are made that much more sad when his fate is revealed. The characters are all incredibly interesting and well-developed. We learn much about Kotov, Nadya, and Mitya. The latter is especially interesting. We can see immediately that there is something wrong with Mitya and do not trust him. Then, when he and Kotov pretend to be friends around Nadya, we begin to feel he is not that bad of a character, and that the movie might end well (I did, at least). But finally, when he kills the lost farmer and salutes the image of Stalin (one of my favorite moments), we realize Mitya is gone. However, given everything that the film does to show cruelty, I was surprised by how tame it made certain scenes. The lost farmer is shot off screen, as is Kotov death. At first glance, this seems unnecessary. Why not show their deaths in full force? In the end though, I think the director made the right decision. There are some scenes that, no matter how powerful they are, will not live up to people's expectations. It was better to leave these moments off-screen so that the audience can imagine them as they see fit. It seems like these scenes are only revealed to the viewer when there was no other choice (like the balloon carrying the image of Stalin). This way, the movie tells as much of the story as it has to and leaves the rest to the audience. I enjoyed it.

    Nikita Mikhalkov's "Burnt By The Sun" is one of those Russian films that deals with Stalin-era oppression in the most frank way possible, something that of course was not allowed in the USSR. It tells the story of general Kotov, a hero of the Russian revolution who is resting with his wife's family in the countryside. He clearly is at peace, but when an long-lost member of the family, Mitya, suddenly returns after ten years of absence, Kotov suspects that he isn't the person they say he used to be anymore: he might have returned as a political officer up to no good. For the most part, the film is exuberant and even sentimental, because what seems to be the apparent focus of the movie is this odd family and the loving character of Kotov (played by the director, Mikhalkov), who is seen as a warm and friendly, and extremely fond of his little daughter (played by Mikhalkov's real daughter) and his beautiful wife Maroussia. The political implications hit a bit unexpectedly in the last quarter of the film, but this shift works quite well. Paradoxically, a bit too much sentimentality is inserted in this last section of the film, which makes the ending somewhat predictable. This sentimentality is probably what gave the film an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in the first place.

    or only testimony. or homage. a film in which Tchekov nuances are parts of a profound terrible lesson about values. about duty, about cowardice, about roots and fruits of love, about little things of life, about games as shadows and idealism as cage. about heroism and expectations. about death and power of sacrifice. about limits and beauty. about innocence and a cruel maleficent time. about portrait of a man. and its mark as mirror of a lost East.sure, a masterpiece. with many definitions. gorgeous images, Mikhalkov science of details, music, great cast, delicate questions. but its value is more subtle. it is art to create a drawing. a perfect image of a tragedy out of words, image, imagination. to make a gift to an universe for who the past is almost fiction. to reflect a present not very different by this hideous portrait. for say the Truth. as aura in a summer. behind the presence of a very familiar stranger. his words. his games. his mission. his death. letters of an old tale. about truth, faith and happiness. few money. and silhouette of Juda. a tale. same colors in a mirror. a mirror of East.

    When an old friend shows up at a family in Russia in 1936, at the very beginning of the great terror of the people by the Communist regime, it costs them their happiness. Eventually. Really, almost all of this is just steeped in that glee. A solid hour of this passes with nothing at all happening. And not much does take place after that. I have no problem with character development, but this has far too many roles for us to remember even half of them, and it doesn't seem like it's important, other than to emphasize that they are, well, all there, and all in a good mood. And this has a lot of "noise", with singing, cheering and in general, you can hear something much of the time. This is filmed well, and the acting tends to be convincing. It shows what it was like back then, if it is a tad, well, covered in a sugary glaze considering what it's about. Charm? Sure. This does have occasional compelling imagery, as well. I suppose that this is like other movies from France, but I know that they can look straight in the eye of something negative, also, and I think it would have fit better to do so here, as well. There is sexuality, language and bloody, disturbing violence(mostly not shown) in this. I recommend this to, well, fans of this kind of thing. 7/10

    I'd never actually seen an Academy Award Best Foreign Language winner until I saw this and my hopes were pretty high. I have to say I was a little disappointed. Firstly, the film was beautiful to watch. The locations really showed off the sheer beauty of Russia (I presume it was shot in Russia, and secondly the whole thing really did feel like a piece of art- carefully crafted and lovingly put together. I applaud the making of. However, the acting quality was inconsistent. Mikhalkov was very good at the lovable "uncle Jo" figure. Every moment he was on screen his presence felt commanding despite the kind jolly figure he played. I think that Oleg Menshikov stole the show. His portrayal of a bitter, vengeful man started off very subtle until he built it into something of a madman at the end, was brilliant. Mikhalkova was also wonderful to watch as the young girl, innocent and sweet, yet curious and smart. I do feel that some of the supporting cast were a little pointless, a few of them need not have been there perhaps, it added to the confusion of the film. Next, the story was really gripping, once it got going. I have no problem with a film starting slow and moving and a slow pace but this film of just over 2 hours felt like well over 2 and a half. I did thing the story was really interesting and once I got into it I really did feel the terror of Stalin's brutal regime. It was also an interesting film morally, I constantly felt myself drawn between the two main characters, not sure who to root for, which I felt was wrong because it was kind of obvious, I felt, who was supposed to be the villain. The ending also felt a little odd. With all of the build up that finally got going I felt that the ending was too underwhelming. I felt a little let down, I kind of got the message about Stalin but I felt that after all the build up it kind of didn't go anywhere. It was still a really good film and well worth watching for the performance of the leads and the scenery.

    Like the Italian film Life Is Beautiful which came three years later, Burnt by the Sun is an excellent foreign movie combining humour and colourful characters to depict tragedy in the first half of the twentieth century. Burnt focuses on Russia in 1936, just before the Great Purge. This movie isn't as funny as the beginning of Life Is Beautiful, but some whimsical discussion is heard of summer Santas and wizards; there's piano playing with a gas mask; there's a question about leaving the zoo. But this is a mostly serious movie. It shows a very close relationship between a Russian colonel, Kotov, and his young daughter Nadya. Then it bluntly shows Kotov being arrested, torn from her life. In this way, Burnt by the Sun reveals the human tragedy of Stalin's paranoia and purges. There's more- though Kotov is a man destroyed by the Soviet Union, the unfortunate irony is that he was actually a patriotic and loyal Soviet. The scene where he and his daughter are on a boat underlines that fact, and makes what happens later look tragically needless. I first saw this gem in a university class on the Soviet Union. It came with a disclaimer from the professor that sending people to summer homes of Stalin's victims was not the way the Purges were really done. Like Life Is Beautiful, we have to bend realism a bit, but it's worth it. I'm not sure if this movie needed the mysterious orb of light; when I saw it hovering over a field, I asked my professor if it was going to make a crop circle. Actually it was just symbolism. The ball of light and the sun mentioned in the title are the Russian Revolution, and this movie is about people burnt by it. Equating the Revolution to something warm and bright makes me wonder if the Revolution is seen in this movie as a mostly good thing; but this movie shows there were also negative consequences. Orb of light or no orb of light, this movie is still memorable and wonderful.

    Burnt By the Sun is probably one of the greatest films of post-war Russian cinema. It is at first sight a wonderful, joyful, beautiful evocation of the perfect summer. It is filled with wonderful characters, laughter, joy and those small touches that make it a real joy to watch - yet behind this facade lie the darker side of the Soviet dream. The plot of the arrival at the Artist's Commune of a long gone Mitya, who is a talented handsome man with a dark secret, by the end of the film you will be heartbroken, broken, and left to ponder how many contrasts Mother Russia has. An extraordinary film that overbrims with ideas and character Burnt By The Sun remains one of the great films of world cinema that anyone who is in any way serious about film should see - but more than that it is a joy to watch - great, great performances and story and a wonderful film about Russia.

    That rarity: Burnt By The Sun is a film that feels as if the people who made it lived through the period it describes. During an idyllic summer in the mid-1930s Russia, a flamboyant colonel's (Nikita Mikhalkov) household is thrown into turmoil by the arrival of a figure from the past. The ugly betrayals of the Stalin era are documented in as pretty and lulling as any picture to have emerged from Russia in recent times; an advanced degree of historical and political scholarship may be required to grasp all the film's resonances. Burnt By The Sun received the Grand Prize at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, among many other honours.

    You can see why this got the best foreign language Oscar: an anti-communist Russian film - the Americans must have been purring. It's a decent film, basically sentimental (like The Pianist) though nothing to rave about. The General's tender relationship with his wife and child, with which we are beaten around the head for a couple of hours, is far less interesting than the almost shocking idea of post-revolutionary Russia in shimmering colour, where the sun still shines and people still picnic by the river - looking nothing at all like Eisenstein et al had it. Apparently, folks still hung out at the dacha in those days, and here we have the usual genteel bunch in white flannels as if transplanted from a Bergman film. Mikhalkov wants us to know and like them all, but the film would be leaner and better without the extra baggage. Plenty of scenes are vaguely unsatisfactory, like a joke told by someone you don't like. There is a "fireball" motif which doesn't work at all. But the real problem is that all the scene-setting means two hours of beating around the bush (literally, in some scenes), in order to set up the powerful and moving final ten minutes, which has beating of another kind, and which appears to come straight out of the Coen brothers.

    That rarity: Burnt By The Sun is a film that feels as if the people who made it lived through the period it describes. During an idyllic summer in the mid-1930s Russia, a flamboyant colonel's (Nikita Mikhalkov) household is thrown into turmoil by the arrival of a figure from the past. The ugly betrayals of the Stalin era are documented in as pretty and lulling as any picture to have emerged from Russia in recent times; an advanced degree of historical and political scholarship may be required to grasp all the film's resonances. Burnt By The Sun received the Grand Prize at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, among many other honours.

    You can see why this got the best foreign language Oscar: an anti-communist Russian film - the Americans must have been purring. It's a decent film, basically sentimental (like The Pianist) though nothing to rave about. The General's tender relationship with his wife and child, with which we are beaten around the head for a couple of hours, is far less interesting than the almost shocking idea of post-revolutionary Russia in shimmering colour, where the sun still shines and people still picnic by the river - looking nothing at all like Eisenstein et al had it. Apparently, folks still hung out at the dacha in those days, and here we have the usual genteel bunch in white flannels as if transplanted from a Bergman film. Mikhalkov wants us to know and like them all, but the film would be leaner and better without the extra baggage. Plenty of scenes are vaguely unsatisfactory, like a joke told by someone you don't like. There is a "fireball" motif which doesn't work at all. But the real problem is that all the scene-setting means two hours of beating around the bush (literally, in some scenes), in order to set up the powerful and moving final ten minutes, which has beating of another kind, and which appears to come straight out of the Coen brothers.

    Finally KGB colonel Mihalkov shows his real face ! In this awful movie, we see a good (!?!?) Bolshevik colonel, in... 1936 ! Since 1933 till 1936, only in Ukraine, more than THREE MILLIONS died by starvation, because of these 'good' or bad Bolsheviks ! How many of the Russian elite died in the so called 'revolution' and the years that follows ? Ten millions ? 15 ? 20 millions ? How many Baltics, Moldavians, Caucasians or central Asia people died in Siberia camps, Ural or Arctic mines ? How many hundreds thousands of land workers, engineers, teachers, lawyers ? All the high Bolsheviks were bloody criminals, without exception, starting with Lenin, Trotski or Stalin. See also their children: Mao, Kim Ir Sen, Fidel, Ceausescu, Enver Hodja, Pol Pot etc etc. Try 2 serious movies about the reds: Soviet Story, 2008 or Katyn, 2007.

    Burnt by the Sun is a fantastically made film, focusing on the injustices of Stalin. It details the arrest of a Russian Civil War veteran, Sergei Petrovich Kotov. At 135 minutes, some will say that the movie runs long but I disagree. While the plot does not really begin until the second half, the extra time is not wasted on viewers. We see much of Kotov, his family, and are made that much more sad when his fate is revealed. The characters are all incredibly interesting and well-developed. We learn much about Kotov, Nadya, and Mitya. The latter is especially interesting. We can see immediately that there is something wrong with Mitya and do not trust him. Then, when he and Kotov pretend to be friends around Nadya, we begin to feel he is not that bad of a character, and that the movie might end well (I did, at least). But finally, when he kills the lost farmer and salutes the image of Stalin (one of my favorite moments), we realize Mitya is gone. However, given everything that the film does to show cruelty, I was surprised by how tame it made certain scenes. The lost farmer is shot off screen, as is Kotov death. At first glance, this seems unnecessary. Why not show their deaths in full force? In the end though, I think the director made the right decision. There are some scenes that, no matter how powerful they are, will not live up to people's expectations. It was better to leave these moments off-screen so that the audience can imagine them as they see fit. It seems like these scenes are only revealed to the viewer when there was no other choice (like the balloon carrying the image of Stalin). This way, the movie tells as much of the story as it has to and leaves the rest to the audience. I enjoyed it.

    Nikita Mikhalkov's "Burnt By The Sun" is one of those Russian films that deals with Stalin-era oppression in the most frank way possible, something that of course was not allowed in the USSR. It tells the story of general Kotov, a hero of the Russian revolution who is resting with his wife's family in the countryside. He clearly is at peace, but when an long-lost member of the family, Mitya, suddenly returns after ten years of absence, Kotov suspects that he isn't the person they say he used to be anymore: he might have returned as a political officer up to no good. For the most part, the film is exuberant and even sentimental, because what seems to be the apparent focus of the movie is this odd family and the loving character of Kotov (played by the director, Mikhalkov), who is seen as a warm and friendly, and extremely fond of his little daughter (played by Mikhalkov's real daughter) and his beautiful wife Maroussia. The political implications hit a bit unexpectedly in the last quarter of the film, but this shift works quite well. Paradoxically, a bit too much sentimentality is inserted in this last section of the film, which makes the ending somewhat predictable. This sentimentality is probably what gave the film an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in the first place.

    or only testimony. or homage. a film in which Tchekov nuances are parts of a profound terrible lesson about values. about duty, about cowardice, about roots and fruits of love, about little things of life, about games as shadows and idealism as cage. about heroism and expectations. about death and power of sacrifice. about limits and beauty. about innocence and a cruel maleficent time. about portrait of a man. and its mark as mirror of a lost East.sure, a masterpiece. with many definitions. gorgeous images, Mikhalkov science of details, music, great cast, delicate questions. but its value is more subtle. it is art to create a drawing. a perfect image of a tragedy out of words, image, imagination. to make a gift to an universe for who the past is almost fiction. to reflect a present not very different by this hideous portrait. for say the Truth. as aura in a summer. behind the presence of a very familiar stranger. his words. his games. his mission. his death. letters of an old tale. about truth, faith and happiness. few money. and silhouette of Juda. a tale. same colors in a mirror. a mirror of East.

    When an old friend shows up at a family in Russia in 1936, at the very beginning of the great terror of the people by the Communist regime, it costs them their happiness. Eventually. Really, almost all of this is just steeped in that glee. A solid hour of this passes with nothing at all happening. And not much does take place after that. I have no problem with character development, but this has far too many roles for us to remember even half of them, and it doesn't seem like it's important, other than to emphasize that they are, well, all there, and all in a good mood. And this has a lot of "noise", with singing, cheering and in general, you can hear something much of the time. This is filmed well, and the acting tends to be convincing. It shows what it was like back then, if it is a tad, well, covered in a sugary glaze considering what it's about. Charm? Sure. This does have occasional compelling imagery, as well. I suppose that this is like other movies from France, but I know that they can look straight in the eye of something negative, also, and I think it would have fit better to do so here, as well. There is sexuality, language and bloody, disturbing violence(mostly not shown) in this. I recommend this to, well, fans of this kind of thing. 7/10

    I'd never actually seen an Academy Award Best Foreign Language winner until I saw this and my hopes were pretty high. I have to say I was a little disappointed. Firstly, the film was beautiful to watch. The locations really showed off the sheer beauty of Russia (I presume it was shot in Russia, and secondly the whole thing really did feel like a piece of art- carefully crafted and lovingly put together. I applaud the making of. However, the acting quality was inconsistent. Mikhalkov was very good at the lovable "uncle Jo" figure. Every moment he was on screen his presence felt commanding despite the kind jolly figure he played. I think that Oleg Menshikov stole the show. His portrayal of a bitter, vengeful man started off very subtle until he built it into something of a madman at the end, was brilliant. Mikhalkova was also wonderful to watch as the young girl, innocent and sweet, yet curious and smart. I do feel that some of the supporting cast were a little pointless, a few of them need not have been there perhaps, it added to the confusion of the film. Next, the story was really gripping, once it got going. I have no problem with a film starting slow and moving and a slow pace but this film of just over 2 hours felt like well over 2 and a half. I did thing the story was really interesting and once I got into it I really did feel the terror of Stalin's brutal regime. It was also an interesting film morally, I constantly felt myself drawn between the two main characters, not sure who to root for, which I felt was wrong because it was kind of obvious, I felt, who was supposed to be the villain. The ending also felt a little odd. With all of the build up that finally got going I felt that the ending was too underwhelming. I felt a little let down, I kind of got the message about Stalin but I felt that after all the build up it kind of didn't go anywhere. It was still a really good film and well worth watching for the performance of the leads and the scenery.

    Like the Italian film Life Is Beautiful which came three years later, Burnt by the Sun is an excellent foreign movie combining humour and colourful characters to depict tragedy in the first half of the twentieth century. Burnt focuses on Russia in 1936, just before the Great Purge. This movie isn't as funny as the beginning of Life Is Beautiful, but some whimsical discussion is heard of summer Santas and wizards; there's piano playing with a gas mask; there's a question about leaving the zoo. But this is a mostly serious movie. It shows a very close relationship between a Russian colonel, Kotov, and his young daughter Nadya. Then it bluntly shows Kotov being arrested, torn from her life. In this way, Burnt by the Sun reveals the human tragedy of Stalin's paranoia and purges. There's more- though Kotov is a man destroyed by the Soviet Union, the unfortunate irony is that he was actually a patriotic and loyal Soviet. The scene where he and his daughter are on a boat underlines that fact, and makes what happens later look tragically needless. I first saw this gem in a university class on the Soviet Union. It came with a disclaimer from the professor that sending people to summer homes of Stalin's victims was not the way the Purges were really done. Like Life Is Beautiful, we have to bend realism a bit, but it's worth it. I'm not sure if this movie needed the mysterious orb of light; when I saw it hovering over a field, I asked my professor if it was going to make a crop circle. Actually it was just symbolism. The ball of light and the sun mentioned in the title are the Russian Revolution, and this movie is about people burnt by it. Equating the Revolution to something warm and bright makes me wonder if the Revolution is seen in this movie as a mostly good thing; but this movie shows there were also negative consequences. Orb of light or no orb of light, this movie is still memorable and wonderful.

    Burnt By the Sun is probably one of the greatest films of post-war Russian cinema. It is at first sight a wonderful, joyful, beautiful evocation of the perfect summer. It is filled with wonderful characters, laughter, joy and those small touches that make it a real joy to watch - yet behind this facade lie the darker side of the Soviet dream. The plot of the arrival at the Artist's Commune of a long gone Mitya, who is a talented handsome man with a dark secret, by the end of the film you will be heartbroken, broken, and left to ponder how many contrasts Mother Russia has. An extraordinary film that overbrims with ideas and character Burnt By The Sun remains one of the great films of world cinema that anyone who is in any way serious about film should see - but more than that it is a joy to watch - great, great performances and story and a wonderful film about Russia.

The plot of the arrival at the Artist's Commune of a long gone Mitya, who is a talented handsome man with a dark secret, by the end of the film you will be heartbroken, broken, and left to ponder how many contrasts Mother Russia has. An extraordinary film that overbrims with ideas and character Burnt By The Sun remains one of the great films of world cinema that anyone who is in any way serious about film should see - but more than that it is a joy to watch - great, great performances and story and a wonderful film about Russia.

    That rarity: Burnt By The Sun is a film that feels as if the people who made it lived through the period it describes. During an idyllic summer in the mid-1930s Russia, a flamboyant colonel's (Nikita Mikhalkov) household is thrown into turmoil by the arrival of a figure from the past. The ugly betrayals of the Stalin era are documented in as pretty and lulling as any picture to have emerged from Russia in recent times; an advanced degree of historical and political scholarship may be required to grasp all the film's resonances. Burnt By The Sun received the Grand Prize at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, among many other honours.

    You can see why this got the best foreign language Oscar: an anti-communist Russian film - the Americans must have been purring. It's a decent film, basically sentimental (like The Pianist) though nothing to rave about. The General's tender relationship with his wife and child, with which we are beaten around the head for a couple of hours, is far less interesting than the almost shocking idea of post-revolutionary Russia in shimmering colour, where the sun still shines and people still picnic by the river - looking nothing at all like Eisenstein et al had it. Apparently, folks still hung out at the dacha in those days, and here we have the usual genteel bunch in white flannels as if transplanted from a Bergman film. Mikhalkov wants us to know and like them all, but the film would be leaner and better without the extra baggage. Plenty of scenes are vaguely unsatisfactory, like a joke told by someone you don't like. There is a "fireball" motif which doesn't work at all. But the real problem is that all the scene-setting means two hours of beating around the bush (literally, in some scenes), in order to set up the powerful and moving final ten minutes, which has beating of another kind, and which appears to come straight out of the Coen brothers.

    Finally KGB colonel Mihalkov shows his real face ! In this awful movie, we see a good (!?!?) Bolshevik colonel, in... 1936 ! Since 1933 till 1936, only in Ukraine, more than THREE MILLIONS died by starvation, because of these 'good' or bad Bolsheviks ! How many of the Russian elite died in the so called 'revolution' and the years that follows ? Ten millions ? 15 ? 20 millions ? How many Baltics, Moldavians, Caucasians or central Asia people died in Siberia camps, Ural or Arctic mines ? How many hundreds thousands of land workers, engineers, teachers, lawyers ? All the high Bolsheviks were bloody criminals, without exception, starting with Lenin, Trotski or Stalin. See also their children: Mao, Kim Ir Sen, Fidel, Ceausescu, Enver Hodja, Pol Pot etc etc. Try 2 serious movies about the reds: Soviet Story, 2008 or Katyn, 2007.

    Burnt by the Sun is a fantastically made film, focusing on the injustices of Stalin. It details the arrest of a Russian Civil War veteran, Sergei Petrovich Kotov. At 135 minutes, some will say that the movie runs long but I disagree. While the plot does not really begin until the second half, the extra time is not wasted on viewers. We see much of Kotov, his family, and are made that much more sad when his fate is revealed. The characters are all incredibly interesting and well-developed. We learn much about Kotov, Nadya, and Mitya. The latter is especially interesting. We can see immediately that there is something wrong with Mitya and do not trust him. Then, when he and Kotov pretend to be friends around Nadya, we begin to feel he is not that bad of a character, and that the movie might end well (I did, at least). But finally, when he kills the lost farmer and salutes the image of Stalin (one of my favorite moments), we realize Mitya is gone. However, given everything that the film does to show cruelty, I was surprised by how tame it made certain scenes. The lost farmer is shot off screen, as is Kotov death. At first glance, this seems unnecessary. Why not show their deaths in full force? In the end though, I think the director made the right decision. There are some scenes that, no matter how powerful they are, will not live up to people's expectations. It was better to leave these moments off-screen so that the audience can imagine them as they see fit. It seems like these scenes are only revealed to the viewer when there was no other choice (like the balloon carrying the image of Stalin). This way, the movie tells as much of the story as it has to and leaves the rest to the audience. I enjoyed it.

    Nikita Mikhalkov's "Burnt By The Sun" is one of those Russian films that deals with Stalin-era oppression in the most frank way possible, something that of course was not allowed in the USSR. It tells the story of general Kotov, a hero of the Russian revolution who is resting with his wife's family in the countryside. He clearly is at peace, but when an long-lost member of the family, Mitya, suddenly returns after ten years of absence, Kotov suspects that he isn't the person they say he used to be anymore: he might have returned as a political officer up to no good. For the most part, the film is exuberant and even sentimental, because what seems to be the apparent focus of the movie is this odd family and the loving character of Kotov (played by the director, Mikhalkov), who is seen as a warm and friendly, and extremely fond of his little daughter (played by Mikhalkov's real daughter) and his beautiful wife Maroussia. The political implications hit a bit unexpectedly in the last quarter of the film, but this shift works quite well. Paradoxically, a bit too much sentimentality is inserted in this last section of the film, which makes the ending somewhat predictable. This sentimentality is probably what gave the film an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in the first place.

    or only testimony. or homage. a film in which Tchekov nuances are parts of a profound terrible lesson about values. about duty, about cowardice, about roots and fruits of love, about little things of life, about games as shadows and idealism as cage. about heroism and expectations. about death and power of sacrifice. about limits and beauty. about innocence and a cruel maleficent time. about portrait of a man. and its mark as mirror of a lost East.sure, a masterpiece. with many definitions. gorgeous images, Mikhalkov science of details, music, great cast, delicate questions. but its value is more subtle. it is art to create a drawing. a perfect image of a tragedy out of words, image, imagination. to make a gift to an universe for who the past is almost fiction. to reflect a present not very different by this hideous portrait. for say the Truth. as aura in a summer. behind the presence of a very familiar stranger. his words. his games. his mission. his death. letters of an old tale. about truth, faith and happiness. few money. and silhouette of Juda. a tale. same colors in a mirror. a mirror of East.

    When an old friend shows up at a family in Russia in 1936, at the very beginning of the great terror of the people by the Communist regime, it costs them their happiness. Eventually. Really, almost all of this is just steeped in that glee. A solid hour of this passes with nothing at all happening. And not much does take place after that. I have no problem with character development, but this has far too many roles for us to remember even half of them, and it doesn't seem like it's important, other than to emphasize that they are, well, all there, and all in a good mood. And this has a lot of "noise", with singing, cheering and in general, you can hear something much of the time. This is filmed well, and the acting tends to be convincing. It shows what it was like back then, if it is a tad, well, covered in a sugary glaze considering what it's about. Charm? Sure. This does have occasional compelling imagery, as well. I suppose that this is like other movies from France, but I know that they can look straight in the eye of something negative, also, and I think it would have fit better to do so here, as well. There is sexuality, language and bloody, disturbing violence(mostly not shown) in this. I recommend this to, well, fans of this kind of thing. 7/10

    I'd never actually seen an Academy Award Best Foreign Language winner until I saw this and my hopes were pretty high. I have to say I was a little disappointed. Firstly, the film was beautiful to watch. The locations really showed off the sheer beauty of Russia (I presume it was shot in Russia, and secondly the whole thing really did feel like a piece of art- carefully crafted and lovingly put together. I applaud the making of. However, the acting quality was inconsistent. Mikhalkov was very good at the lovable "uncle Jo" figure. Every moment he was on screen his presence felt commanding despite the kind jolly figure he played. I think that Oleg Menshikov stole the show. His portrayal of a bitter, vengeful man started off very subtle until he built it into something of a madman at the end, was brilliant. Mikhalkova was also wonderful to watch as the young girl, innocent and sweet, yet curious and smart. I do feel that some of the supporting cast were a little pointless, a few of them need not have been there perhaps, it added to the confusion of the film. Next, the story was really gripping, once it got going. I have no problem with a film starting slow and moving and a slow pace but this film of just over 2 hours felt like well over 2 and a half. I did thing the story was really interesting and once I got into it I really did feel the terror of Stalin's brutal regime. It was also an interesting film morally, I constantly felt myself drawn between the two main characters, not sure who to root for, which I felt was wrong because it was kind of obvious, I felt, who was supposed to be the villain. The ending also felt a little odd. With all of the build up that finally got going I felt that the ending was too underwhelming. I felt a little let down, I kind of got the message about Stalin but I felt that after all the build up it kind of didn't go anywhere. It was still a really good film and well worth watching for the performance of the leads and the scenery.

    Like the Italian film Life Is Beautiful which came three years later, Burnt by the Sun is an excellent foreign movie combining humour and colourful characters to depict tragedy in the first half of the twentieth century. Burnt focuses on Russia in 1936, just before the Great Purge. This movie isn't as funny as the beginning of Life Is Beautiful, but some whimsical discussion is heard of summer Santas and wizards; there's piano playing with a gas mask; there's a question about leaving the zoo. But this is a mostly serious movie. It shows a very close relationship between a Russian colonel, Kotov, and his young daughter Nadya. Then it bluntly shows Kotov being arrested, torn from her life. In this way, Burnt by the Sun reveals the human tragedy of Stalin's paranoia and purges. There's more- though Kotov is a man destroyed by the Soviet Union, the unfortunate irony is that he was actually a patriotic and loyal Soviet. The scene where he and his daughter are on a boat underlines that fact, and makes what happens later look tragically needless. I first saw this gem in a university class on the Soviet Union. It came with a disclaimer from the professor that sending people to summer homes of Stalin's victims was not the way the Purges were really done. Like Life Is Beautiful, we have to bend realism a bit, but it's worth it. I'm not sure if this movie needed the mysterious orb of light; when I saw it hovering over a field, I asked my professor if it was going to make a crop circle. Actually it was just symbolism. The ball of light and the sun mentioned in the title are the Russian Revolution, and this movie is about people burnt by it. Equating the Revolution to something warm and bright makes me wonder if the Revolution is seen in this movie as a mostly good thing; but this movie shows there were also negative consequences. Orb of light or no orb of light, this movie is still memorable and wonderful.

    Burnt By the Sun is probably one of the greatest films of post-war Russian cinema. It is at first sight a wonderful, joyful, beautiful evocation of the perfect summer. It is filled with wonderful characters, laughter, joy and those small touches that make it a real joy to watch - yet behind this facade lie the darker side of the Soviet dream. The plot of the arrival at the Artist's Commune of a long gone Mitya, who is a talented handsome man with a dark secret, by the end of the film you will be heartbroken, broken, and left to ponder how many contrasts Mother Russia has. An extraordinary film that overbrims with ideas and character Burnt By The Sun remains one of the great films of world cinema that anyone who is in any way serious about film should see - but more than that it is a joy to watch - great, great performances and story and a wonderful film about Russia.

    That rarity: Burnt By The Sun is a film that feels as if the people who made it lived through the period it describes. During an idyllic summer in the mid-1930s Russia, a flamboyant colonel's (Nikita Mikhalkov) household is thrown into turmoil by the arrival of a figure from the past. The ugly betrayals of the Stalin era are documented in as pretty and lulling as any picture to have emerged from Russia in recent times; an advanced degree of historical and political scholarship may be required to grasp all the film's resonances. Burnt By The Sun received the Grand Prize at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, among many other honours.

    You can see why this got the best foreign language Oscar: an anti-communist Russian film - the Americans must have been purring. It's a decent film, basically sentimental (like The Pianist) though nothing to rave about. The General's tender relationship with his wife and child, with which we are beaten around the head for a couple of hours, is far less interesting than the almost shocking idea of post-revolutionary Russia in shimmering colour, where the sun still shines and people still picnic by the river - looking nothing at all like Eisenstein et al had it. Apparently, folks still hung out at the dacha in those days, and here we have the usual genteel bunch in white flannels as if transplanted from a Bergman film. Mikhalkov wants us to know and like them all, but the film would be leaner and better without the extra baggage. Plenty of scenes are vaguely unsatisfactory, like a joke told by someone you don't like. There is a "fireball" motif which doesn't work at all. But the real problem is that all the scene-setting means two hours of beating around the bush (literally, in some scenes), in order to set up the powerful and moving final ten minutes, which has beating of another kind, and which appears to come straight out of the Coen brothers.

    Finally KGB colonel Mihalkov shows his real face ! In this awful movie, we see a good (!?!?) Bolshevik colonel, in... 1936 ! Since 1933 till 1936, only in Ukraine, more than THREE MILLIONS died by starvation, because of these 'good' or bad Bolsheviks ! How many of the Russian elite died in the so called 'revolution' and the years that follows ? Ten millions ? 15 ? 20 millions ? How many Baltics, Moldavians, Caucasians or central Asia people died in Siberia camps, Ural or Arctic mines ? How many hundreds thousands of land workers, engineers, teachers, lawyers ? All the high Bolsheviks were bloody criminals, without exception, starting with Lenin, Trotski or Stalin. See also their children: Mao, Kim Ir Sen, Fidel, Ceausescu, Enver Hodja, Pol Pot etc etc. Try 2 serious movies about the reds: Soviet Story, 2008 or Katyn, 2007.

    Burnt by the Sun is a fantastically made film, focusing on the injustices of Stalin. It details the arrest of a Russian Civil War veteran, Sergei Petrovich Kotov. At 135 minutes, some will say that the movie runs long but I disagree. While the plot does not really begin until the second half, the extra time is not wasted on viewers. We see much of Kotov, his family, and are made that much more sad when his fate is revealed. The characters are all incredibly interesting and well-developed. We learn much about Kotov, Nadya, and Mitya. The latter is especially interesting. We can see immediately that there is something wrong with Mitya and do not trust him. Then, when he and Kotov pretend to be friends around Nadya, we begin to feel he is not that bad of a character, and that the movie might end well (I did, at least). But finally, when he kills the lost farmer and salutes the image of Stalin (one of my favorite moments), we realize Mitya is gone. However, given everything that the film does to show cruelty, I was surprised by how tame it made certain scenes. The lost farmer is shot off screen, as is Kotov death. At first glance, this seems unnecessary. Why not show their deaths in full force? In the end though, I think the director made the right decision. There are some scenes that, no matter how powerful they are, will not live up to people's expectations. It was better to leave these moments off-screen so that the audience can imagine them as they see fit. It seems like these scenes are only revealed to the viewer when there was no other choice (like the balloon carrying the image of Stalin). This way, the movie tells as much of the story as it has to and leaves the rest to the audience. I enjoyed it.

    Nikita Mikhalkov's "Burnt By The Sun" is one of those Russian films that deals with Stalin-era oppression in the most frank way possible, something that of course was not allowed in the USSR. It tells the story of general Kotov, a hero of the Russian revolution who is resting with his wife's family in the countryside. He clearly is at peace, but when an long-lost member of the family, Mitya, suddenly returns after ten years of absence, Kotov suspects that he isn't the person they say he used to be anymore: he might have returned as a political officer up to no good. For the most part, the film is exuberant and even sentimental, because what seems to be the apparent focus of the movie is this odd family and the loving character of Kotov (played by the director, Mikhalkov), who is seen as a warm and friendly, and extremely fond of his little daughter (played by Mikhalkov's real daughter) and his beautiful wife Maroussia. The political implications hit a bit unexpectedly in the last quarter of the film, but this shift works quite well. Paradoxically, a bit too much sentimentality is inserted in this last section of the film, which makes the ending somewhat predictable. This sentimentality is probably what gave the film an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in the first place.

    or only testimony. or homage. a film in which Tchekov nuances are parts of a profound terrible lesson about values. about duty, about cowardice, about roots and fruits of love, about little things of life, about games as shadows and idealism as cage. about heroism and expectations. about death and power of sacrifice. about limits and beauty. about innocence and a cruel maleficent time. about portrait of a man. and its mark as mirror of a lost East.sure, a masterpiece. with many definitions. gorgeous images, Mikhalkov science of details, music, great cast, delicate questions. but its value is more subtle. it is art to create a drawing. a perfect image of a tragedy out of words, image, imagination. to make a gift to an universe for who the past is almost fiction. to reflect a present not very different by this hideous portrait. for say the Truth. as aura in a summer. behind the presence of a very familiar stranger. his words. his games. his mission. his death. letters of an old tale. about truth, faith and happiness. few money. and silhouette of Juda. a tale. same colors in a mirror. a mirror of East.

    When an old friend shows up at a family in Russia in 1936, at the very beginning of the great terror of the people by the Communist regime, it costs them their happiness. Eventually. Really, almost all of this is just steeped in that glee. A solid hour of this passes with nothing at all happening. And not much does take place after that. I have no problem with character development, but this has far too many roles for us to remember even half of them, and it doesn't seem like it's important, other than to emphasize that they are, well, all there, and all in a good mood. And this has a lot of "noise", with singing, cheering and in general, you can hear something much of the time. This is filmed well, and the acting tends to be convincing. It shows what it was like back then, if it is a tad, well, covered in a sugary glaze considering what it's about. Charm? Sure. This does have occasional compelling imagery, as well. I suppose that this is like other movies from France, but I know that they can look straight in the eye of something negative, also, and I think it would have fit better to do so here, as well. There is sexuality, language and bloody, disturbing violence(mostly not shown) in this. I recommend this to, well, fans of this kind of thing. 7/10

    I'd never actually seen an Academy Award Best Foreign Language winner until I saw this and my hopes were pretty high. I have to say I was a little disappointed. Firstly, the film was beautiful to watch. The locations really showed off the sheer beauty of Russia (I presume it was shot in Russia, and secondly the whole thing really did feel like a piece of art- carefully crafted and lovingly put together. I applaud the making of. However, the acting quality was inconsistent. Mikhalkov was very good at the lovable "uncle Jo" figure. Every moment he was on screen his presence felt commanding despite the kind jolly figure he played. I think that Oleg Menshikov stole the show. His portrayal of a bitter, vengeful man started off very subtle until he built it into something of a madman at the end, was brilliant. Mikhalkova was also wonderful to watch as the young girl, innocent and sweet, yet curious and smart. I do feel that some of the supporting cast were a little pointless, a few of them need not have been there perhaps, it added to the confusion of the film. Next, the story was really gripping, once it got going. I have no problem with a film starting slow and moving and a slow pace but this film of just over 2 hours felt like well over 2 and a half. I did thing the story was really interesting and once I got into it I really did feel the terror of Stalin's brutal regime. It was also an interesting film morally, I constantly felt myself drawn between the two main characters, not sure who to root for, which I felt was wrong because it was kind of obvious, I felt, who was supposed to be the villain. The ending also felt a little odd. With all of the build up that finally got going I felt that the ending was too underwhelming. I felt a little let down, I kind of got the message about Stalin but I felt that after all the build up it kind of didn't go anywhere. It was still a really good film and well worth watching for the performance of the leads and the scenery.

    Like the Italian film Life Is Beautiful which came three years later, Burnt by the Sun is an excellent foreign movie combining humour and colourful characters to depict tragedy in the first half of the twentieth century. Burnt focuses on Russia in 1936, just before the Great Purge. This movie isn't as funny as the beginning of Life Is Beautiful, but some whimsical discussion is heard of summer Santas and wizards; there's piano playing with a gas mask; there's a question about leaving the zoo. But this is a mostly serious movie. It shows a very close relationship between a Russian colonel, Kotov, and his young daughter Nadya. Then it bluntly shows Kotov being arrested, torn from her life. In this way, Burnt by the Sun reveals the human tragedy of Stalin's paranoia and purges. There's more- though Kotov is a man destroyed by the Soviet Union, the unfortunate irony is that he was actually a patriotic and loyal Soviet. The scene where he and his daughter are on a boat underlines that fact, and makes what happens later look tragically needless. I first saw this gem in a university class on the Soviet Union. It came with a disclaimer from the professor that sending people to summer homes of Stalin's victims was not the way the Purges were really done. Like Life Is Beautiful, we have to bend realism a bit, but it's worth it. I'm not sure if this movie needed the mysterious orb of light; when I saw it hovering over a field, I asked my professor if it was going to make a crop circle. Actually it was just symbolism. The ball of light and the sun mentioned in the title are the Russian Revolution, and this movie is about people burnt by it. Equating the Revolution to something warm and bright makes me wonder if the Revolution is seen in this movie as a mostly good thing; but this movie shows there were also negative consequences. Orb of light or no orb of light, this movie is still memorable and wonderful.
