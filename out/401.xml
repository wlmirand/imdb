 <sinopse>
  The original '70s TV family is now placed in the 1990s, where they're even more square and out of place than ever.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Mike Brady and his wife Carol Brady have just only one week to come up with $20,000 in back taxes or their house is sold and they'll have no choice but to move. And it's up to the Brady kids to secretly raise money and save the homestead before they lose their house to their scheming neighbor Mr. Larry Dittmeyer.

    I was tooling through the Las Angeles area when a voice comes over the c.b. 'Breadk 1 - 9,this is Christmas Carol. Im looking for a blue eyed blond by the name of Jan. Tell her mama bear and papa bear loves her." that's when the chatter started on channel 21. Someone says Jan ran off with her boyfriend Tyrone. Someone else says an alien named Pedro abducted her. Some one calls Art Bell and said Bigfoot abducted Jan because they needed breeding stock. Then Schultze came over the squak and says,"Christmas Carol,i got a 20 on a blue eyed gal named Jan. I dropped her off at Clinton Place." I was wondering why Schultzee took Jan all the way to the White house. This is a funny movie. Well wrighten,directed and acted. Well Done!!! Ann B Davis drives the Freightliner big rig. Ann B Davis is a permanent A list actor!!! Shelley Long, Christine Taytor, Jennifer Cox, Harretta Mantel,Florence Henderswon,Jean Smart,Beverly Archer,Yolanda Snowball,Ann b Davis, Elisa GHabrielli and the cougars worshiping Davy Jones at the prom are hot!! Olivia hacks' performance is outstanding!! ---One Truck Drivers' Opinion--- erldwgstruckermovies.com

    Here's the story of The Brady Bunch Movie. Which was funnier than one would ex- pect. Most of the humor was pleasant, like the series. But some of it fell flat. Here's the story of the lovely actors. Who played their roles with a crafty sense of style. They were fit-ting, all very solid. Yes, it was somewhat worthwhile. And if one day I'm strick-en with cyni-cism. And you look onto this review as not groovy. You can go on to not trust me. After I enjoyed The Brady Bunch Movie. Yes, I did. I guiltily liked The Brady Bunch Movie. Starring: Gary Cole, Shelley Long, Henriette Mantel, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Christine Taylor, Paul Sutera, Jennifer Elise Cox, Jesse Lee, Alanna Ubach, and Olivia Hack. Directed by: Betty Thomas.

    My friend, when learning that I had taped and was watching this movie said: "You're kidding! You're not going to watch the Brady Bunch movie! You're sick!" My response is that he is just a blind idiot that thinks style is everything that is him and if nobody conforms to him then they have a problem. Okay, the Brady Bunch movie is not the best of all movies, but it is funny in a very satirical sort of way. I never watched the Brady Bunch when I was young, and never really liked it, but I thought the clever part of the movie was trapping them in the 70's and bringing them into the nineties. This movie looks at the 90's in a very satirical sort of way, yet the Bradys are completely innocent and don't realise that the world has changed. Where everybody is playing heavy metal and chasing same sex relationships, the Brady's still think Davey Jones is a hit and consider a kiss at the door is the furthest one should go on the first date (not that I really disagree with this, but being 26, one no longer dates, but rather forms relationships with the people around me and we simply get to know each other, but then I'm not exactly the one who knows everything about dating). This seems to be the style that movies move, or the way that I think they should movie, focusing more on satire. Thomas in this movie is clashing the ideal family with the reality of the 90's. It is an attack on the American Dream, and even though they win through in the end, the entire situation is so absurd that one has not option but to laugh. The patriotic speech is a little annoying and creates an unrealistic feel that props up the American Dream once again. I feel that everything that is done to undermine the dream through the movie is completely destroyed by the speech. Then I think that it is something that would detract from a Brady Bunch Movie anyway. But when I consider the speech, it is creating the ideal again, what should be and is not. We should have our neighbourhood and should be allowed to live there in peace, but we all know that it is not true. What happened to the Bradys was absurd, but we know that in reality this will never happen. The point of this is to drag the stupidity of the situation to an extreme end so as to show how stupid it really is. This reminds me that I should sit down and write the drama script in this light, stretching the stupidity to the absolute absurdity.

    This movie was the ultimate adventure, it had everything! Drama, Suspense, Thrill, Action, Tears, Laughter EVERYTHING! It was by far the best film of all time! It really should have won an Oscar. I couldn't believe this masterful piece of cinematography! It was UNREAL! I mean come on who doesn't love the Brady Bunch and then they were thrown into todays world... GENIUS! Oh boy it was simply the best. I also would recommend checking out the sequel, this was even better than the original! (I know, I didn't think that it was possible either) It is just amazing how they include the original show and what was going on and off screen into these movies, They are my favorite! And the lines, who could forget Mr. Brady's wonderful speeches, so insightful. Who could forget Alice and her ongoing relationship problems with Sam, so wonderful! Just watch these, you won't regret it!

    Today's younger generation probably only knows The Brady Bunch from reruns, but it was the most popular sitcom of the 70's. This movie places the Brady Bunch in 1995, but they still act and dress like they were in the 70's. The movie is very funny and has a typical Brady plot of the family overcoming a crisis. The casting is dead-on. All of the characters looked and acted very much like the original, with the exception of Greg Brady. Barnes did a fine job, but he didn't look just like Greg & acted more dorky, this is the writer's fault. All in all, the film's a good time, even if you're not a Brady Bunch fan.

    I understand the premise of this film. Transplant a time capsuled sitcom from the 70's to the bleak world of the 90's and let the wackiness ensue, right? Oh, and lets not forget to cover every single classic moment from the series in order to please the nostalgia factor, right? It cant possibly fail if we use this sure fire formula, right? WRONG!!!!!!!!!! I couldn't believe how DULL this movie was. Even when they do cover the series' memorable catch phrase's and scenes it feels cheap and contrived. I think I would have rather viewed a TV retrospective special than see different actors portray it on the movie screen. Also, when the gimmick of them in there 70's clothes, hair and mannerisms interacting with the people of the 90's just falls flat. I know they are supposed to come off as strange but in a comedic way. Here they do it in just a plain strange way. You actually side with the contemporary people and wish somebody would call the cops and throw them into a padded cell. Despite all that the script offers nothing much for them to do except the things I have already stated, which don't work. Frankly, I think this is one TV to movie cross over that should have never been attempted.

    Shelley Long had Florence Henderson right there on the set to guide her and Gary Cole certainly had the spirit of Robert Reed channeled to play Mike Brady. The two headed up a cast that really satirized the famous sugary sitcom that Paramount television brought us from 1969 to 1974, The Brady Bunch. Time has stood still for the family in The Brady Bunch Movie. Gary Cole and Shelley Long have raised their blended family right from the Seventies. The parents and kids listen to the music, dress in the fashion and behave otherwise as if the Eighties and Nineties just never took place. The kids stand out quite a bit from their peers in their suburban school. The main plot such as it is has the Bradys being under siege by their neighbors, the Dittmyers, Michael McKean and Jean Smart who need the Brady home in order to complete a big real estate deal. They'll get it by fair means or foul. The Dittmyers are best described as poor relations of that other TV family, the Bundys. A big part of the problem with this film is that you would have to have been a fan of the show and presumably have seen it in reruns a gazillion times on the TVLand channel in order to appreciate it. About 15 of the various episodes are used in creating the plot. That's a component that someone who never saw the show couldn't possibly get. Still some of the sly innuendo also comes from the Nineties culture with RuPaul as the school guidance counselor eying Christopher Daniel Barnes as Greg and a young lesbian girl carrying a big old torch for Marcia played by Christine Taylor. Jennifer Elise Cox has taken over nicely the role of the ever dissatisfied middle sister Jan who the real and original Carol Brady as the grandmother finally deals with in the appropriate manner. As in any of the television Brady episodes goodness and vacuity ultimately triumph and to find out how and which episode plot lines are used to bring that about, you'll have to sit back and enjoy the big screen version of America's most famous blended family.

    When I first heard about this film being in production, I was about as happy as you'd be if you heard about a giant meteorite heading to destroy the Earth! After all, despite the original show having a bit of a following, the show was completely saccharine and impossible for anyone other than kids to like. So why, oh why, would I want to see this?! Well, it turns out I was wrong--wrong because the film WAS good to watch and wrong because this was NOT the same Brady Bunch I remember from my youth. So what was so right about this film? Well, first it was not a remake of the show, but a parody of it--the only way this could have worked. In this case, it's the same sort of Brady family BUT they are living exactly as they did in 1970--despite it being 1995. In other words, the clothes, the language, the actors and their spot-on impersonations of the originals (I particularly loved Gary Cole and the way he talked just like Mike Brady) and the music are all circa 1970--and everyone around the Brady family just stares at them in total disbelief. TO make things even better, there is a wonderful visit from Davy Jones as well as a wonderful plot involving Jan and hear jealousy of Marsha, Marsha, Marsha! As for the plot, this might be the biggest weakness. While it isn't bad, the film's theme of the evil neighbors and the Brady family losing their home never is as fun or interesting as the sequel--A VERY BRADY SEQUEL--and you MUST see this sequel. It is a hoot!

    Clever spoof on "The Brady Bunch" TV series. The Bradys are still living like it's the 1970s but it's 1995. They wear the terrible 70s fashions, are all squeaky clean and friendly and are totally oblivious that the times have changed. Various plots from the old TV show are used and the reactions from 1990s people are frequently hilarious. However this is probably only for a select audience. I grew up watching it on TV when I was in grade school and saw it constantly in reruns when I was in junior high and high school. Therefore I have mostly every episode memorized. The movie has plenty of in jokes for fans of the series and people like me (I sort of like the show but I'm no fan). So if you're not familiar with the Bradys or the show you might not like it. I originally caught this at a theatre back in 1995. It was wall to wall baby boomers and college kids. When the title song came on the whole audience joined in loudly and loved the whole movie! So I think most people will like it and get it. The whole cast looks almost exactly like their TV counterparts with the sole exception of Gary Cole who looks nothing like Robert Reed. On the other hand Shelley Long is a dead ringer for Florence Henderson. The Brady house looks exactly like it did in the TV show--heck, they even use the same music! Also there are cameos from various original cast members and other 70s stars (like Davy Jones and the Monkees). There are also a few dance and song numbers (all from the original show) that are energetic and colorful (if you ignore the inane lyrics). There's also a few gay positive characters squeezed in. There's a lesbian school mate after Marcia (who's totally oblivious) and an interracial gay couple living on the same street as the Bradys. I personally LOVE this movie and think it's hysterical. I give it a 10.

In this case, it's the same sort of Brady family BUT they are living exactly as they did in 1970--despite it being 1995. In other words, the clothes, the language, the actors and their spot-on impersonations of the originals (I particularly loved Gary Cole and the way he talked just like Mike Brady) and the music are all circa 1970--and everyone around the Brady family just stares at them in total disbelief. TO make things even better, there is a wonderful visit from Davy Jones as well as a wonderful plot involving Jan and hear jealousy of Marsha, Marsha, Marsha! As for the plot, this might be the biggest weakness. While it isn't bad, the film's theme of the evil neighbors and the Brady family losing their home never is as fun or interesting as the sequel--A VERY BRADY SEQUEL--and you MUST see this sequel. It is a hoot!

    Clever spoof on "The Brady Bunch" TV series. The Bradys are still living like it's the 1970s but it's 1995. They wear the terrible 70s fashions, are all squeaky clean and friendly and are totally oblivious that the times have changed. Various plots from the old TV show are used and the reactions from 1990s people are frequently hilarious. However this is probably only for a select audience. I grew up watching it on TV when I was in grade school and saw it constantly in reruns when I was in junior high and high school. Therefore I have mostly every episode memorized. The movie has plenty of in jokes for fans of the series and people like me (I sort of like the show but I'm no fan). So if you're not familiar with the Bradys or the show you might not like it. I originally caught this at a theatre back in 1995. It was wall to wall baby boomers and college kids. When the title song came on the whole audience joined in loudly and loved the whole movie! So I think most people will like it and get it. The whole cast looks almost exactly like their TV counterparts with the sole exception of Gary Cole who looks nothing like Robert Reed. On the other hand Shelley Long is a dead ringer for Florence Henderson. The Brady house looks exactly like it did in the TV show--heck, they even use the same music! Also there are cameos from various original cast members and other 70s stars (like Davy Jones and the Monkees). There are also a few dance and song numbers (all from the original show) that are energetic and colorful (if you ignore the inane lyrics). There's also a few gay positive characters squeezed in. There's a lesbian school mate after Marcia (who's totally oblivious) and an interracial gay couple living on the same street as the Bradys. I personally LOVE this movie and think it's hysterical. I give it a 10.

    I was tooling through the Las Angeles area when a voice comes over the c.b. 'Breadk 1 - 9,this is Christmas Carol. Im looking for a blue eyed blond by the name of Jan. Tell her mama bear and papa bear loves her." that's when the chatter started on channel 21. Someone says Jan ran off with her boyfriend Tyrone. Someone else says an alien named Pedro abducted her. Some one calls Art Bell and said Bigfoot abducted Jan because they needed breeding stock. Then Schultze came over the squak and says,"Christmas Carol,i got a 20 on a blue eyed gal named Jan. I dropped her off at Clinton Place." I was wondering why Schultzee took Jan all the way to the White house. This is a funny movie. Well wrighten,directed and acted. Well Done!!! Ann B Davis drives the Freightliner big rig. Ann B Davis is a permanent A list actor!!! Shelley Long, Christine Taytor, Jennifer Cox, Harretta Mantel,Florence Henderswon,Jean Smart,Beverly Archer,Yolanda Snowball,Ann b Davis, Elisa GHabrielli and the cougars worshiping Davy Jones at the prom are hot!! Olivia hacks' performance is outstanding!! ---One Truck Drivers' Opinion--- erldwgstruckermovies.com

    Here's the story of The Brady Bunch Movie. Which was funnier than one would ex- pect. Most of the humor was pleasant, like the series. But some of it fell flat. Here's the story of the lovely actors. Who played their roles with a crafty sense of style. They were fit-ting, all very solid. Yes, it was somewhat worthwhile. And if one day I'm strick-en with cyni-cism. And you look onto this review as not groovy. You can go on to not trust me. After I enjoyed The Brady Bunch Movie. Yes, I did. I guiltily liked The Brady Bunch Movie. Starring: Gary Cole, Shelley Long, Henriette Mantel, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Christine Taylor, Paul Sutera, Jennifer Elise Cox, Jesse Lee, Alanna Ubach, and Olivia Hack. Directed by: Betty Thomas.

    My friend, when learning that I had taped and was watching this movie said: "You're kidding! You're not going to watch the Brady Bunch movie! You're sick!" My response is that he is just a blind idiot that thinks style is everything that is him and if nobody conforms to him then they have a problem. Okay, the Brady Bunch movie is not the best of all movies, but it is funny in a very satirical sort of way. I never watched the Brady Bunch when I was young, and never really liked it, but I thought the clever part of the movie was trapping them in the 70's and bringing them into the nineties. This movie looks at the 90's in a very satirical sort of way, yet the Bradys are completely innocent and don't realise that the world has changed. Where everybody is playing heavy metal and chasing same sex relationships, the Brady's still think Davey Jones is a hit and consider a kiss at the door is the furthest one should go on the first date (not that I really disagree with this, but being 26, one no longer dates, but rather forms relationships with the people around me and we simply get to know each other, but then I'm not exactly the one who knows everything about dating). This seems to be the style that movies move, or the way that I think they should movie, focusing more on satire. Thomas in this movie is clashing the ideal family with the reality of the 90's. It is an attack on the American Dream, and even though they win through in the end, the entire situation is so absurd that one has not option but to laugh. The patriotic speech is a little annoying and creates an unrealistic feel that props up the American Dream once again. I feel that everything that is done to undermine the dream through the movie is completely destroyed by the speech. Then I think that it is something that would detract from a Brady Bunch Movie anyway. But when I consider the speech, it is creating the ideal again, what should be and is not. We should have our neighbourhood and should be allowed to live there in peace, but we all know that it is not true. What happened to the Bradys was absurd, but we know that in reality this will never happen. The point of this is to drag the stupidity of the situation to an extreme end so as to show how stupid it really is. This reminds me that I should sit down and write the drama script in this light, stretching the stupidity to the absolute absurdity.

    This movie was the ultimate adventure, it had everything! Drama, Suspense, Thrill, Action, Tears, Laughter EVERYTHING! It was by far the best film of all time! It really should have won an Oscar. I couldn't believe this masterful piece of cinematography! It was UNREAL! I mean come on who doesn't love the Brady Bunch and then they were thrown into todays world... GENIUS! Oh boy it was simply the best. I also would recommend checking out the sequel, this was even better than the original! (I know, I didn't think that it was possible either) It is just amazing how they include the original show and what was going on and off screen into these movies, They are my favorite! And the lines, who could forget Mr. Brady's wonderful speeches, so insightful. Who could forget Alice and her ongoing relationship problems with Sam, so wonderful! Just watch these, you won't regret it!

    Today's younger generation probably only knows The Brady Bunch from reruns, but it was the most popular sitcom of the 70's. This movie places the Brady Bunch in 1995, but they still act and dress like they were in the 70's. The movie is very funny and has a typical Brady plot of the family overcoming a crisis. The casting is dead-on. All of the characters looked and acted very much like the original, with the exception of Greg Brady. Barnes did a fine job, but he didn't look just like Greg & acted more dorky, this is the writer's fault. All in all, the film's a good time, even if you're not a Brady Bunch fan.

    I understand the premise of this film. Transplant a time capsuled sitcom from the 70's to the bleak world of the 90's and let the wackiness ensue, right? Oh, and lets not forget to cover every single classic moment from the series in order to please the nostalgia factor, right? It cant possibly fail if we use this sure fire formula, right? WRONG!!!!!!!!!! I couldn't believe how DULL this movie was. Even when they do cover the series' memorable catch phrase's and scenes it feels cheap and contrived. I think I would have rather viewed a TV retrospective special than see different actors portray it on the movie screen. Also, when the gimmick of them in there 70's clothes, hair and mannerisms interacting with the people of the 90's just falls flat. I know they are supposed to come off as strange but in a comedic way. Here they do it in just a plain strange way. You actually side with the contemporary people and wish somebody would call the cops and throw them into a padded cell. Despite all that the script offers nothing much for them to do except the things I have already stated, which don't work. Frankly, I think this is one TV to movie cross over that should have never been attempted.

    Shelley Long had Florence Henderson right there on the set to guide her and Gary Cole certainly had the spirit of Robert Reed channeled to play Mike Brady. The two headed up a cast that really satirized the famous sugary sitcom that Paramount television brought us from 1969 to 1974, The Brady Bunch. Time has stood still for the family in The Brady Bunch Movie. Gary Cole and Shelley Long have raised their blended family right from the Seventies. The parents and kids listen to the music, dress in the fashion and behave otherwise as if the Eighties and Nineties just never took place. The kids stand out quite a bit from their peers in their suburban school. The main plot such as it is has the Bradys being under siege by their neighbors, the Dittmyers, Michael McKean and Jean Smart who need the Brady home in order to complete a big real estate deal. They'll get it by fair means or foul. The Dittmyers are best described as poor relations of that other TV family, the Bundys. A big part of the problem with this film is that you would have to have been a fan of the show and presumably have seen it in reruns a gazillion times on the TVLand channel in order to appreciate it. About 15 of the various episodes are used in creating the plot. That's a component that someone who never saw the show couldn't possibly get. Still some of the sly innuendo also comes from the Nineties culture with RuPaul as the school guidance counselor eying Christopher Daniel Barnes as Greg and a young lesbian girl carrying a big old torch for Marcia played by Christine Taylor. Jennifer Elise Cox has taken over nicely the role of the ever dissatisfied middle sister Jan who the real and original Carol Brady as the grandmother finally deals with in the appropriate manner. As in any of the television Brady episodes goodness and vacuity ultimately triumph and to find out how and which episode plot lines are used to bring that about, you'll have to sit back and enjoy the big screen version of America's most famous blended family.

    When I first heard about this film being in production, I was about as happy as you'd be if you heard about a giant meteorite heading to destroy the Earth! After all, despite the original show having a bit of a following, the show was completely saccharine and impossible for anyone other than kids to like. So why, oh why, would I want to see this?! Well, it turns out I was wrong--wrong because the film WAS good to watch and wrong because this was NOT the same Brady Bunch I remember from my youth. So what was so right about this film? Well, first it was not a remake of the show, but a parody of it--the only way this could have worked. In this case, it's the same sort of Brady family BUT they are living exactly as they did in 1970--despite it being 1995.

TO make things even better, there is a wonderful visit from Davy Jones as well as a wonderful plot involving Jan and hear jealousy of Marsha, Marsha, Marsha! As for the plot, this might be the biggest weakness.

As in any of the television Brady episodes goodness and vacuity ultimately triumph and to find out how and which episode plot lines are used to bring that about, you'll have to sit back and enjoy the big screen version of America's most famous blended family.

    When I first heard about this film being in production, I was about as happy as you'd be if you heard about a giant meteorite heading to destroy the Earth! After all, despite the original show having a bit of a following, the show was completely saccharine and impossible for anyone other than kids to like. So why, oh why, would I want to see this?! Well, it turns out I was wrong--wrong because the film WAS good to watch and wrong because this was NOT the same Brady Bunch I remember from my youth. So what was so right about this film? Well, first it was not a remake of the show, but a parody of it--the only way this could have worked. In this case, it's the same sort of Brady family BUT they are living exactly as they did in 1970--despite it being 1995. In other words, the clothes, the language, the actors and their spot-on impersonations of the originals (I particularly loved Gary Cole and the way he talked just like Mike Brady) and the music are all circa 1970--and everyone around the Brady family just stares at them in total disbelief. TO make things even better, there is a wonderful visit from Davy Jones as well as a wonderful plot involving Jan and hear jealousy of Marsha, Marsha, Marsha! As for the plot, this might be the biggest weakness. While it isn't bad, the film's theme of the evil neighbors and the Brady family losing their home never is as fun or interesting as the sequel--A VERY BRADY SEQUEL--and you MUST see this sequel. It is a hoot!

    Clever spoof on "The Brady Bunch" TV series. The Bradys are still living like it's the 1970s but it's 1995. They wear the terrible 70s fashions, are all squeaky clean and friendly and are totally oblivious that the times have changed. Various plots from the old TV show are used and the reactions from 1990s people are frequently hilarious. However this is probably only for a select audience. I grew up watching it on TV when I was in grade school and saw it constantly in reruns when I was in junior high and high school. Therefore I have mostly every episode memorized. The movie has plenty of in jokes for fans of the series and people like me (I sort of like the show but I'm no fan). So if you're not familiar with the Bradys or the show you might not like it. I originally caught this at a theatre back in 1995. It was wall to wall baby boomers and college kids. When the title song came on the whole audience joined in loudly and loved the whole movie! So I think most people will like it and get it. The whole cast looks almost exactly like their TV counterparts with the sole exception of Gary Cole who looks nothing like Robert Reed. On the other hand Shelley Long is a dead ringer for Florence Henderson. The Brady house looks exactly like it did in the TV show--heck, they even use the same music! Also there are cameos from various original cast members and other 70s stars (like Davy Jones and the Monkees). There are also a few dance and song numbers (all from the original show) that are energetic and colorful (if you ignore the inane lyrics). There's also a few gay positive characters squeezed in. There's a lesbian school mate after Marcia (who's totally oblivious) and an interracial gay couple living on the same street as the Bradys. I personally LOVE this movie and think it's hysterical. I give it a 10.

    I was tooling through the Las Angeles area when a voice comes over the c.b. 'Breadk 1 - 9,this is Christmas Carol. Im looking for a blue eyed blond by the name of Jan. Tell her mama bear and papa bear loves her." that's when the chatter started on channel 21. Someone says Jan ran off with her boyfriend Tyrone. Someone else says an alien named Pedro abducted her. Some one calls Art Bell and said Bigfoot abducted Jan because they needed breeding stock. Then Schultze came over the squak and says,"Christmas Carol,i got a 20 on a blue eyed gal named Jan. I dropped her off at Clinton Place." I was wondering why Schultzee took Jan all the way to the White house. This is a funny movie. Well wrighten,directed and acted. Well Done!!! Ann B Davis drives the Freightliner big rig. Ann B Davis is a permanent A list actor!!! Shelley Long, Christine Taytor, Jennifer Cox, Harretta Mantel,Florence Henderswon,Jean Smart,Beverly Archer,Yolanda Snowball,Ann b Davis, Elisa GHabrielli and the cougars worshiping Davy Jones at the prom are hot!!

    Here's the story of The Brady Bunch Movie. Which was funnier than one would ex- pect. Most of the humor was pleasant, like the series. But some of it fell flat. Here's the story of the lovely actors. Who played their roles with a crafty sense of style. They were fit-ting, all very solid. Yes, it was somewhat worthwhile. And if one day I'm strick-en with cyni-cism. And you look onto this review as not groovy. You can go on to not trust me. After I enjoyed The Brady Bunch Movie. Yes, I did. I guiltily liked The Brady Bunch Movie. Starring: Gary Cole, Shelley Long, Henriette Mantel, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Christine Taylor, Paul Sutera, Jennifer Elise Cox, Jesse Lee, Alanna Ubach, and Olivia Hack. Directed by: Betty Thomas.

    My friend, when learning that I had taped and was watching this movie said: "You're kidding! You're not going to watch the Brady Bunch movie! You're sick!" My response is that he is just a blind idiot that thinks style is everything that is him and if nobody conforms to him then they have a problem. Okay, the Brady Bunch movie is not the best of all movies, but it is funny in a very satirical sort of way. I never watched the Brady Bunch when I was young, and never really liked it, but I thought the clever part of the movie was trapping them in the 70's and bringing them into the nineties. This movie looks at the 90's in a very satirical sort of way, yet the Bradys are completely innocent and don't realise that the world has changed. Where everybody is playing heavy metal and chasing same sex relationships, the Brady's still think Davey Jones is a hit and consider a kiss at the door is the furthest one should go on the first date (not that I really disagree with this, but being 26, one no longer dates, but rather forms relationships with the people around me and we simply get to know each other, but then I'm not exactly the one who knows everything about dating). This seems to be the style that movies move, or the way that I think they should movie, focusing more on satire. Thomas in this movie is clashing the ideal family with the reality of the 90's. It is an attack on the American Dream, and even though they win through in the end, the entire situation is so absurd that one has not option but to laugh. The patriotic speech is a little annoying and creates an unrealistic feel that props up the American Dream once again. I feel that everything that is done to undermine the dream through the movie is completely destroyed by the speech. Then I think that it is something that would detract from a Brady Bunch Movie anyway. But when I consider the speech, it is creating the ideal again, what should be and is not. We should have our neighbourhood and should be allowed to live there in peace, but we all know that it is not true. What happened to the Bradys was absurd, but we know that in reality this will never happen. The point of this is to drag the stupidity of the situation to an extreme end so as to show how stupid it really is. This reminds me that I should sit down and write the drama script in this light, stretching the stupidity to the absolute absurdity.

    This movie was the ultimate adventure, it had everything! Drama, Suspense, Thrill, Action, Tears, Laughter EVERYTHING! It was by far the best film of all time! It really should have won an Oscar. I couldn't believe this masterful piece of cinematography! It was UNREAL! I mean come on who doesn't love the Brady Bunch and then they were thrown into todays world... GENIUS! Oh boy it was simply the best. I also would recommend checking out the sequel, this was even better than the original! (I know, I didn't think that it was possible either) It is just amazing how they include the original show and what was going on and off screen into these movies, They are my favorite! And the lines, who could forget Mr. Brady's wonderful speeches, so insightful. Who could forget Alice and her ongoing relationship problems with Sam, so wonderful! Just watch these, you won't regret it!

    Today's younger generation probably only knows The Brady Bunch from reruns, but it was the most popular sitcom of the 70's. This movie places the Brady Bunch in 1995, but they still act and dress like they were in the 70's. The movie is very funny and has a typical Brady plot of the family overcoming a crisis. The casting is dead-on. All of the characters looked and acted very much like the original, with the exception of Greg Brady. Barnes did a fine job, but he didn't look just like Greg & acted more dorky, this is the writer's fault. All in all, the film's a good time, even if you're not a Brady Bunch fan.

    I understand the premise of this film. Transplant a time capsuled sitcom from the 70's to the bleak world of the 90's and let the wackiness ensue, right? Oh, and lets not forget to cover every single classic moment from the series in order to please the nostalgia factor, right? It cant possibly fail if we use this sure fire formula, right? WRONG!!!!!!!!!! I couldn't believe how DULL this movie was. Even when they do cover the series' memorable catch phrase's and scenes it feels cheap and contrived. I think I would have rather viewed a TV retrospective special than see different actors portray it on the movie screen. Also, when the gimmick of them in there 70's clothes, hair and mannerisms interacting with the people of the 90's just falls flat. I know they are supposed to come off as strange but in a comedic way. Here they do it in just a plain strange way. You actually side with the contemporary people and wish somebody would call the cops and throw them into a padded cell. Despite all that the script offers nothing much for them to do except the things I have already stated, which don't work. Frankly, I think this is one TV to movie cross over that should have never been attempted.

    Shelley Long had Florence Henderson right there on the set to guide her and Gary Cole certainly had the spirit of Robert Reed channeled to play Mike Brady. The two headed up a cast that really satirized the famous sugary sitcom that Paramount television brought us from 1969 to 1974, The Brady Bunch. Time has stood still for the family in The Brady Bunch Movie. Gary Cole and Shelley Long have raised their blended family right from the Seventies. The parents and kids listen to the music, dress in the fashion and behave otherwise as if the Eighties and Nineties just never took place. The kids stand out quite a bit from their peers in their suburban school. The main plot such as it is has the Bradys being under siege by their neighbors, the Dittmyers, Michael McKean and Jean Smart who need the Brady home in order to complete a big real estate deal. They'll get it by fair means or foul. The Dittmyers are best described as poor relations of that other TV family, the Bundys. A big part of the problem with this film is that you would have to have been a fan of the show and presumably have seen it in reruns a gazillion times on the TVLand channel in order to appreciate it. About 15 of the various episodes are used in creating the plot. That's a component that someone who never saw the show couldn't possibly get. Still some of the sly innuendo also comes from the Nineties culture with RuPaul as the school guidance counselor eying Christopher Daniel Barnes as Greg and a young lesbian girl carrying a big old torch for Marcia played by Christine Taylor. Jennifer Elise Cox has taken over nicely the role of the ever dissatisfied middle sister Jan who the real and original Carol Brady as the grandmother finally deals with in the appropriate manner. As in any of the television Brady episodes goodness and vacuity ultimately triumph and to find out how and which episode plot lines are used to bring that about, you'll have to sit back and enjoy the big screen version of America's most famous blended family.

Time has stood still for the family in The Brady Bunch Movie. Gary Cole and Shelley Long have raised their blended family right from the Seventies. The parents and kids listen to the music, dress in the fashion and behave otherwise as if the Eighties and Nineties just never took place. The kids stand out quite a bit from their peers in their suburban school. The main plot such as it is has the Bradys being under siege by their neighbors, the Dittmyers, Michael McKean and Jean Smart who need the Brady home in order to complete a big real estate deal. They'll get it by fair means or foul. The Dittmyers are best described as poor relations of that other TV family, the Bundys. A big part of the problem with this film is that you would have to have been a fan of the show and presumably have seen it in reruns a gazillion times on the TVLand channel in order to appreciate it. About 15 of the various episodes are used in creating the plot. That's a component that someone who never saw the show couldn't possibly get. Still some of the sly innuendo also comes from the Nineties culture with RuPaul as the school guidance counselor eying Christopher Daniel Barnes as Greg and a young lesbian girl carrying a big old torch for Marcia played by Christine Taylor. Jennifer Elise Cox has taken over nicely the role of the ever dissatisfied middle sister Jan who the real and original Carol Brady as the grandmother finally deals with in the appropriate manner. As in any of the television Brady episodes goodness and vacuity ultimately triumph and to find out how and which episode plot lines are used to bring that about, you'll have to sit back and enjoy the big screen version of America's most famous blended family.

    When I first heard about this film being in production, I was about as happy as you'd be if you heard about a giant meteorite heading to destroy the Earth! After all, despite the original show having a bit of a following, the show was completely saccharine and impossible for anyone other than kids to like. So why, oh why, would I want to see this?! Well, it turns out I was wrong--wrong because the film WAS good to watch and wrong because this was NOT the same Brady Bunch I remember from my youth. So what was so right about this film? Well, first it was not a remake of the show, but a parody of it--the only way this could have worked. In this case, it's the same sort of Brady family BUT they are living exactly as they did in 1970--despite it being 1995. In other words, the clothes, the language, the actors and their spot-on impersonations of the originals (I particularly loved Gary Cole and the way he talked just like Mike Brady) and the music are all circa 1970--and everyone around the Brady family just stares at them in total disbelief. TO make things even better, there is a wonderful visit from Davy Jones as well as a wonderful plot involving Jan and hear jealousy of Marsha, Marsha, Marsha! As for the plot, this might be the biggest weakness. While it isn't bad, the film's theme of the evil neighbors and the Brady family losing their home never is as fun or interesting as the sequel--A VERY BRADY SEQUEL--and you MUST see this sequel. It is a hoot!

    Clever spoof on "The Brady Bunch" TV series. The Bradys are still living like it's the 1970s but it's 1995. They wear the terrible 70s fashions, are all squeaky clean and friendly and are totally oblivious that the times have changed. Various plots from the old TV show are used and the reactions from 1990s people are frequently hilarious. However this is probably only for a select audience. I grew up watching it on TV when I was in grade school and saw it constantly in reruns when I was in junior high and high school. Therefore I have mostly every episode memorized. The movie has plenty of in jokes for fans of the series and people like me (I sort of like the show but I'm no fan). So if you're not familiar with the Bradys or the show you might not like it. I originally caught this at a theatre back in 1995. It was wall to wall baby boomers and college kids. When the title song came on the whole audience joined in loudly and loved the whole movie! So I think most people will like it and get it. The whole cast looks almost exactly like their TV counterparts with the sole exception of Gary Cole who looks nothing like Robert Reed. On the other hand Shelley Long is a dead ringer for Florence Henderson. The Brady house looks exactly like it did in the TV show--heck, they even use the same music! Also there are cameos from various original cast members and other 70s stars (like Davy Jones and the Monkees). There are also a few dance and song numbers (all from the original show) that are energetic and colorful (if you ignore the inane lyrics). There's also a few gay positive characters squeezed in. There's a lesbian school mate after Marcia (who's totally oblivious) and an interracial gay couple living on the same street as the Bradys. I personally LOVE this movie and think it's hysterical. I give it a 10.

    I was tooling through the Las Angeles area when a voice comes over the c.b. 'Breadk 1 - 9,this is Christmas Carol. Im looking for a blue eyed blond by the name of Jan. Tell her mama bear and papa bear loves her." that's when the chatter started on channel 21. Someone says Jan ran off with her boyfriend Tyrone. Someone else says an alien named Pedro abducted her. Some one calls Art Bell and said Bigfoot abducted Jan because they needed breeding stock. Then Schultze came over the squak and says,"Christmas Carol,i got a 20 on a blue eyed gal named Jan. I dropped her off at Clinton Place." I was wondering why Schultzee took Jan all the way to the White house. This is a funny movie. Well wrighten,directed and acted. Well Done!!! Ann B Davis drives the Freightliner big rig. Ann B Davis is a permanent A list actor!!! Shelley Long, Christine Taytor, Jennifer Cox, Harretta Mantel,Florence Henderswon,Jean Smart,Beverly Archer,Yolanda Snowball,Ann b Davis, Elisa GHabrielli and the cougars worshiping Davy Jones at the prom are hot!!

    Here's the story of The Brady Bunch Movie. Which was funnier than one would ex- pect. Most of the humor was pleasant, like the series. But some of it fell flat. Here's the story of the lovely actors. Who played their roles with a crafty sense of style. They were fit-ting, all very solid. Yes, it was somewhat worthwhile. And if one day I'm strick-en with cyni-cism. And you look onto this review as not groovy. You can go on to not trust me. After I enjoyed The Brady Bunch Movie. Yes, I did. I guiltily liked The Brady Bunch Movie. Starring: Gary Cole, Shelley Long, Henriette Mantel, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Christine Taylor, Paul Sutera, Jennifer Elise Cox, Jesse Lee, Alanna Ubach, and Olivia Hack. Directed by: Betty Thomas.

    My friend, when learning that I had taped and was watching this movie said: "You're kidding! You're not going to watch the Brady Bunch movie! You're sick!" My response is that he is just a blind idiot that thinks style is everything that is him and if nobody conforms to him then they have a problem. Okay, the Brady Bunch movie is not the best of all movies, but it is funny in a very satirical sort of way. I never watched the Brady Bunch when I was young, and never really liked it, but I thought the clever part of the movie was trapping them in the 70's and bringing them into the nineties. This movie looks at the 90's in a very satirical sort of way, yet the Bradys are completely innocent and don't realise that the world has changed. Where everybody is playing heavy metal and chasing same sex relationships, the Brady's still think Davey Jones is a hit and consider a kiss at the door is the furthest one should go on the first date (not that I really disagree with this, but being 26, one no longer dates, but rather forms relationships with the people around me and we simply get to know each other, but then I'm not exactly the one who knows everything about dating). This seems to be the style that movies move, or the way that I think they should movie, focusing more on satire. Thomas in this movie is clashing the ideal family with the reality of the 90's. It is an attack on the American Dream, and even though they win through in the end, the entire situation is so absurd that one has not option but to laugh. The patriotic speech is a little annoying and creates an unrealistic feel that props up the American Dream once again. I feel that everything that is done to undermine the dream through the movie is completely destroyed by the speech. Then I think that it is something that would detract from a Brady Bunch Movie anyway. But when I consider the speech, it is creating the ideal again, what should be and is not. We should have our neighbourhood and should be allowed to live there in peace, but we all know that it is not true. What happened to the Bradys was absurd, but we know that in reality this will never happen. The point of this is to drag the stupidity of the situation to an extreme end so as to show how stupid it really is. This reminds me that I should sit down and write the drama script in this light, stretching the stupidity to the absolute absurdity.

    This movie was the ultimate adventure, it had everything! Drama, Suspense, Thrill, Action, Tears, Laughter EVERYTHING! It was by far the best film of all time! It really should have won an Oscar. I couldn't believe this masterful piece of cinematography! It was UNREAL! I mean come on who doesn't love the Brady Bunch and then they were thrown into todays world... GENIUS! Oh boy it was simply the best. I also would recommend checking out the sequel, this was even better than the original! (I know, I didn't think that it was possible either) It is just amazing how they include the original show and what was going on and off screen into these movies, They are my favorite! And the lines, who could forget Mr. Brady's wonderful speeches, so insightful. Who could forget Alice and her ongoing relationship problems with Sam, so wonderful! Just watch these, you won't regret it!

    Today's younger generation probably only knows The Brady Bunch from reruns, but it was the most popular sitcom of the 70's. This movie places the Brady Bunch in 1995, but they still act and dress like they were in the 70's. The movie is very funny and has a typical Brady plot of the family overcoming a crisis. The casting is dead-on. All of the characters looked and acted very much like the original, with the exception of Greg Brady. Barnes did a fine job, but he didn't look just like Greg & acted more dorky, this is the writer's fault. All in all, the film's a good time, even if you're not a Brady Bunch fan.

    I understand the premise of this film. Transplant a time capsuled sitcom from the 70's to the bleak world of the 90's and let the wackiness ensue, right? Oh, and lets not forget to cover every single classic moment from the series in order to please the nostalgia factor, right? It cant possibly fail if we use this sure fire formula, right? WRONG!!!!!!!!!! I couldn't believe how DULL this movie was. Even when they do cover the series' memorable catch phrase's and scenes it feels cheap and contrived. I think I would have rather viewed a TV retrospective special than see different actors portray it on the movie screen. Also, when the gimmick of them in there 70's clothes, hair and mannerisms interacting with the people of the 90's just falls flat. I know they are supposed to come off as strange but in a comedic way. Here they do it in just a plain strange way. You actually side with the contemporary people and wish somebody would call the cops and throw them into a padded cell. Despite all that the script offers nothing much for them to do except the things I have already stated, which don't work. Frankly, I think this is one TV to movie cross over that should have never been attempted.

Also, when the gimmick of them in there 70's clothes, hair and mannerisms interacting with the people of the 90's just falls flat. I know they are supposed to come off as strange but in a comedic way. Here they do it in just a plain strange way. You actually side with the contemporary people and wish somebody would call the cops and throw them into a padded cell. Despite all that the script offers nothing much for them to do except the things I have already stated, which don't work. Frankly, I think this is one TV to movie cross over that should have never been attempted.

    Shelley Long had Florence Henderson right there on the set to guide her and Gary Cole certainly had the spirit of Robert Reed channeled to play Mike Brady. The two headed up a cast that really satirized the famous sugary sitcom that Paramount television brought us from 1969 to 1974, The Brady Bunch. Time has stood still for the family in The Brady Bunch Movie. Gary Cole and Shelley Long have raised their blended family right from the Seventies. The parents and kids listen to the music, dress in the fashion and behave otherwise as if the Eighties and Nineties just never took place. The kids stand out quite a bit from their peers in their suburban school. The main plot such as it is has the Bradys being under siege by their neighbors, the Dittmyers, Michael McKean and Jean Smart who need the Brady home in order to complete a big real estate deal. They'll get it by fair means or foul. The Dittmyers are best described as poor relations of that other TV family, the Bundys. A big part of the problem with this film is that you would have to have been a fan of the show and presumably have seen it in reruns a gazillion times on the TVLand channel in order to appreciate it. About 15 of the various episodes are used in creating the plot. That's a component that someone who never saw the show couldn't possibly get. Still some of the sly innuendo also comes from the Nineties culture with RuPaul as the school guidance counselor eying Christopher Daniel Barnes as Greg and a young lesbian girl carrying a big old torch for Marcia played by Christine Taylor. Jennifer Elise Cox has taken over nicely the role of the ever dissatisfied middle sister Jan who the real and original Carol Brady as the grandmother finally deals with in the appropriate manner. As in any of the television Brady episodes goodness and vacuity ultimately triumph and to find out how and which episode plot lines are used to bring that about, you'll have to sit back and enjoy the big screen version of America's most famous blended family.

    When I first heard about this film being in production, I was about as happy as you'd be if you heard about a giant meteorite heading to destroy the Earth! After all, despite the original show having a bit of a following, the show was completely saccharine and impossible for anyone other than kids to like. So why, oh why, would I want to see this?! Well, it turns out I was wrong--wrong because the film WAS good to watch and wrong because this was NOT the same Brady Bunch I remember from my youth. So what was so right about this film? Well, first it was not a remake of the show, but a parody of it--the only way this could have worked. In this case, it's the same sort of Brady family BUT they are living exactly as they did in 1970--despite it being 1995. In other words, the clothes, the language, the actors and their spot-on impersonations of the originals (I particularly loved Gary Cole and the way he talked just like Mike Brady) and the music are all circa 1970--and everyone around the Brady family just stares at them in total disbelief. TO make things even better, there is a wonderful visit from Davy Jones as well as a wonderful plot involving Jan and hear jealousy of Marsha, Marsha, Marsha! As for the plot, this might be the biggest weakness. While it isn't bad, the film's theme of the evil neighbors and the Brady family losing their home never is as fun or interesting as the sequel--A VERY BRADY SEQUEL--and you MUST see this sequel. It is a hoot!

    Clever spoof on "The Brady Bunch" TV series. The Bradys are still living like it's the 1970s but it's 1995. They wear the terrible 70s fashions, are all squeaky clean and friendly and are totally oblivious that the times have changed. Various plots from the old TV show are used and the reactions from 1990s people are frequently hilarious. However this is probably only for a select audience. I grew up watching it on TV when I was in grade school and saw it constantly in reruns when I was in junior high and high school. Therefore I have mostly every episode memorized. The movie has plenty of in jokes for fans of the series and people like me (I sort of like the show but I'm no fan). So if you're not familiar with the Bradys or the show you might not like it. I originally caught this at a theatre back in 1995. It was wall to wall baby boomers and college kids. When the title song came on the whole audience joined in loudly and loved the whole movie! So I think most people will like it and get it. The whole cast looks almost exactly like their TV counterparts with the sole exception of Gary Cole who looks nothing like Robert Reed. On the other hand Shelley Long is a dead ringer for Florence Henderson. The Brady house looks exactly like it did in the TV show--heck, they even use the same music! Also there are cameos from various original cast members and other 70s stars (like Davy Jones and the Monkees). There are also a few dance and song numbers (all from the original show) that are energetic and colorful (if you ignore the inane lyrics). There's also a few gay positive characters squeezed in. There's a lesbian school mate after Marcia (who's totally oblivious) and an interracial gay couple living on the same street as the Bradys. I personally LOVE this movie and think it's hysterical. I give it a 10.

    I was tooling through the Las Angeles area when a voice comes over the c.b. 'Breadk 1 - 9,this is Christmas Carol. Im looking for a blue eyed blond by the name of Jan. Tell her mama bear and papa bear loves her." that's when the chatter started on channel 21. Someone says Jan ran off with her boyfriend Tyrone. Someone else says an alien named Pedro abducted her. Some one calls Art Bell and said Bigfoot abducted Jan because they needed breeding stock. Then Schultze came over the squak and says,"Christmas Carol,i got a 20 on a blue eyed gal named Jan. I dropped her off at Clinton Place." I was wondering why Schultzee took Jan all the way to the White house. This is a funny movie. Well wrighten,directed and acted. Well Done!!! Ann B Davis drives the Freightliner big rig. Ann B Davis is a permanent A list actor!!! Shelley Long, Christine Taytor, Jennifer Cox, Harretta Mantel,Florence Henderswon,Jean Smart,Beverly Archer,Yolanda Snowball,Ann b Davis, Elisa GHabrielli and the cougars worshiping Davy Jones at the prom are hot!! Olivia hacks' performance is outstanding!! ---One Truck Drivers' Opinion--- erldwgstruckermovies.com

    Here's the story of The Brady Bunch Movie. Which was funnier than one would ex- pect. Most of the humor was pleasant, like the series. But some of it fell flat. Here's the story of the lovely actors. Who played their roles with a crafty sense of style. They were fit-ting, all very solid. Yes, it was somewhat worthwhile. And if one day I'm strick-en with cyni-cism. And you look onto this review as not groovy. You can go on to not trust me. After I enjoyed The Brady Bunch Movie. Yes, I did. I guiltily liked The Brady Bunch Movie. Starring: Gary Cole, Shelley Long, Henriette Mantel, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Christine Taylor, Paul Sutera, Jennifer Elise Cox, Jesse Lee, Alanna Ubach, and Olivia Hack. Directed by: Betty Thomas.

    My friend, when learning that I had taped and was watching this movie said: "You're kidding! You're not going to watch the Brady Bunch movie! You're sick!" My response is that he is just a blind idiot that thinks style is everything that is him and if nobody conforms to him then they have a problem. Okay, the Brady Bunch movie is not the best of all movies, but it is funny in a very satirical sort of way. I never watched the Brady Bunch when I was young, and never really liked it, but I thought the clever part of the movie was trapping them in the 70's and bringing them into the nineties. This movie looks at the 90's in a very satirical sort of way, yet the Bradys are completely innocent and don't realise that the world has changed. Where everybody is playing heavy metal and chasing same sex relationships, the Brady's still think Davey Jones is a hit and consider a kiss at the door is the furthest one should go on the first date (not that I really disagree with this, but being 26, one no longer dates, but rather forms relationships with the people around me and we simply get to know each other, but then I'm not exactly the one who knows everything about dating). This seems to be the style that movies move, or the way that I think they should movie, focusing more on satire. Thomas in this movie is clashing the ideal family with the reality of the 90's. It is an attack on the American Dream, and even though they win through in the end, the entire situation is so absurd that one has not option but to laugh. The patriotic speech is a little annoying and creates an unrealistic feel that props up the American Dream once again. I feel that everything that is done to undermine the dream through the movie is completely destroyed by the speech. Then I think that it is something that would detract from a Brady Bunch Movie anyway. But when I consider the speech, it is creating the ideal again, what should be and is not. We should have our neighbourhood and should be allowed to live there in peace, but we all know that it is not true. What happened to the Bradys was absurd, but we know that in reality this will never happen. The point of this is to drag the stupidity of the situation to an extreme end so as to show how stupid it really is. This reminds me that I should sit down and write the drama script in this light, stretching the stupidity to the absolute absurdity.

    The grooviest movie ever made!! Deserves and Oscar!!!!! "JJJAAAAAAAAAN" "Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!" "I'm the new Jan Brady!" "As a wise man once said, "Wherever you go, there you are."" "Because my glasses make me look positively goofy, but with these new contact lenses i look ultra glamorous!" Nothing could ever top this movie!!! (Except maybe the Sequel when Greg and Marcia fell in love! Who saw that coming!?) Neato! Groovy! Far out! This movie is the best movie I have ever seen!! It's happening in far out ways! Everyone should watch this movie at some point and time!! Even if they have never seen the show! But who hasn't seen the TV show!?

    This movie was the ultimate adventure, it had everything! Drama, Suspense, Thrill, Action, Tears, Laughter EVERYTHING! It was by far the best film of all time! It really should have won an Oscar. I couldn't believe this masterful piece of cinematography! It was UNREAL! I mean come on who doesn't love the Brady Bunch and then they were thrown into todays world... GENIUS! Oh boy it was simply the best. I also would recommend checking out the sequel, this was even better than the original! (I know, I didn't think that it was possible either) It is just amazing how they include the original show and what was going on and off screen into these movies, They are my favorite! And the lines, who could forget Mr. Brady's wonderful speeches, so insightful. Who could forget Alice and her ongoing relationship problems with Sam, so wonderful! Just watch these, you won't regret it!

    Today's younger generation probably only knows The Brady Bunch from reruns, but it was the most popular sitcom of the 70's. This movie places the Brady Bunch in 1995, but they still act and dress like they were in the 70's. The movie is very funny and has a typical Brady plot of the family overcoming a crisis. The casting is dead-on. All of the characters looked and acted very much like the original, with the exception of Greg Brady. Barnes did a fine job, but he didn't look just like Greg & acted more dorky, this is the writer's fault. All in all, the film's a good time, even if you're not a Brady Bunch fan.

    I understand the premise of this film. Transplant a time capsuled sitcom from the 70's to the bleak world of the 90's and let the wackiness ensue, right? Oh, and lets not forget to cover every single classic moment from the series in order to please the nostalgia factor, right? It cant possibly fail if we use this sure fire formula, right? WRONG!!!!!!!!!! I couldn't believe how DULL this movie was. Even when they do cover the series' memorable catch phrase's and scenes it feels cheap and contrived. I think I would have rather viewed a TV retrospective special than see different actors portray it on the movie screen. Also, when the gimmick of them in there 70's clothes, hair and mannerisms interacting with the people of the 90's just falls flat. I know they are supposed to come off as strange but in a comedic way. Here they do it in just a plain strange way.
