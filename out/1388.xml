    A carpet. Few stories as seeds of humanity. Waves of color. Shadows of existence. A huge carpet. Love as threads of this carpet. A parable, a fairy tale, fragment of a honeycomb with mythical honey. Picture of a world in which past and present are a single stitch carpet.Colors, faces music in a mixture who lives in roots of a way to see and describe the universe.. Traditions and games. Confesions of a spirit and water as Ariadne thread. And images. Seductive, fragile, powerful and harsh. Looks as signs of time who is almost piece of clay. A wonderful Iranian movie about the small eternal truth. Twoo old people. A carpet. And a story. The result - an overwhelming beauty.

    Gabbeh is proof that expensive and complicated effects like 3D are no match for pure creativity. Even if you don't understand Gabbeh, which I admit, it will probably take a few screenings before it really makes sense sometimes, the visually stunning aspects of the film were enough to keep the attention of me and my peers. This Iranian gem begs the audience to think less literally and to peer into a foreign society. Gabbeh is in love with a man, who is heard as a wolf's cry in the film, yet her father will not let her be with the man. Stunningly enough, even when the uncle closes his eyes to allow her to leave, Gabbeh stays, illustrating her fearful loyalty to her family and to her values. Throughout the movie a rug is made, a beautiful one at that, and certain colors are weaved in for certain things. To further this aspect, a man teaching children shows colors by pulling them directly from the earth. For example, the man reaches to the sky and pulls his hand back which is now blue, yet the man reaches into a field of red poppies and pulls back a handful of them. These are actually believable instances in the film, showing incredible strength in editing. In other aspects of the film, the landscape that the nomads follow is beautiful and intriguing, from rivers to snowy mountains. Throughout the movie there is a juxtaposition of the young couple's forbidden love with that of an old man and his old wife, who mostly complain and cry a lot. At the end of the film we realize that this is Gabbeh and her husband, who eventually end up together. This bit is a tad confusing, but requires perhaps a few more watches, as mentioned. If you stick with Gabbeh, you wont be disappointed, it is something quite different from anything else you will have seen.

    Repressive countries are by their nature, well, repressive. Freedom of speech is restrained and, thereby, styles of expression as well. This clearly creates a situation where the arts are stunted in their growth. A country with a particular policy would only want their artists to create art which makes sense to both the general population and the ideal the government wants to propagate to that population. To make a film about a contrary topic, or even in an unusual style, could confuse, offend, or subvert people, which the government would not want. Gabbeh, a film from Iran, is a good example of this, as it's very much a film of its place. It is mild, inoffensive, and contains numerous images of a tradition Iranian culture, depicted in a warm and perhaps domineering way. I would almost see it as a promotion of the country. Now the story of the movie follows young woman hoping to marry someone from another tribe, yet many different obstacles stand in her way, obstacles which may sound pretty strange to us, but apparently have some sort of meaning in the culture. For one thing, her uncle has yet to be married. But, at 57, he sure is taking his time! And, then, even after he finally gets hitched, she is told she cannot be married until they complete a long trek and a lot of work. Eventually, however, she defies these constant hindrances, and by doing so, may pay a price. One of the biggest parts of this movie that were great in my opinion, was that of the colors used in this movie, the use of colors to signify many things was brilliant and it brought the movie a better lighting that we haven't seen in movies to much before.

    I found "Gabbeh" boring. It was nearly impossible for me to sit through. There was no excitement. In this film, the director is an artist. Mosen Makhmalbaf does a great job on using colors throughout the movie, but that's the only good thing that I saw. The costumes, the Persian carpet, the sky and landscape vividly show Mosen Makhmalbaf's use of color. I didn't really understand the story at all. Other than the colors, the movie has nothing going for itself. The story wasn't interesting and I didn't feel engaged at all. I will never watch this film again. I get that Mosen Makhmalbaf wanted to display a work of art, but when half of the class is completely clueless there is confusion behind the meaning of the story, don't you think something is wrong?

    The Gabbeh, a type of hand-woven rug made by the Nomadic tribes of the Middle East, is the name and main focus point of the recently released film "Gabbeh". The film starts as the Gabbeh drifts through a shallow river, an old couple, are attempting to cleanse the rug. As the women begins to clean the rug, the spirit of a young girl, perhaps the old lady as a young women, springs from the rug, the young girl says that the rug used to belong to her tribe, and that the rug tells the story of her tribe. The girls tribe is very family oriented, the girl wish to marry, but is told that she cannot, not till her uncle marries. Time passes and the girl's fianc&eacute;/lover follows her tribe on horseback, they finally find a wife for her husband, when her father adds another stipulation. The girl's mother is once again pregnant and the girl, being one of the oldest daughters cannot marry or leave the tribe till her mother has the baby. While this may seem mean of the father, to place all these obstacles in the way of his daughter's marriage, he may have just been ensuring that the man on horseback really wants to marry his daughter; that this man will not just run off at the first sign of trouble or hardship. This could be the father's way of ensuring that the man is serious in his intent to marry the girl. All through the film the fianc&eacute;/ lover follows the tribe remaining faithful to his betrothed. The girl finally decides to run off with her fianc&eacute;/lover, and I can't help but think that is exactly what the father wanted, he was unable to physically let his daughter go, so he forced upon her situations, in which the only way she could truly get what she wanted was by running.

    I pretty much hated this film. I didn't really get the story until I was well within twenty minutes of the film. Yeah, I guess you can say that the colors were really nice. But if that is the basis of the film, if that is the only superb thing about it, then that is really really bad. And that is about what I thought of it. Colors were nice, but the overall film just sucked. It was beyond boring, half the time it is just this old man and old woman washing some rugs. It is completely uninteresting. I mean I guess it is just a generational thing but I mean if the story is even a little interesting I will pay attention and enjoy it. But this film was just not engaging, the story was not interesting. It is hard to appreciate a work of art, which is what I think the filmmaker was going for, without a decent, engaging story.

    This is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Gabbeh, an Iranian film which chronicles the complex life of a young girl and her family who live in the mountains of Iran herding goats, is told with such conviction and simplicity, that it is hard not to fall in love with this film. The narrative displays non-Western conventions, while remaining simple and easy to follow for a Western audience. It is actually quite refreshing to see a film that is told in the way Gabbeh is told. The content of the film is brilliant, with themes of nature, life's beauty and misfortune and complex family relationships. The use of color, which is arguably one of the most unique and interesting features of this film, warrant at least one viewing, if not multiple. Also, using the rug, or, gabbeh, as the film's centerpiece is a wonderful visual anchor, and reads well for a Western audience. If the story is not enough to sell this film, the cinematography more than makes up for any mistakes this film has. The film is short enough that the pastoral imagery remains beautiful and not boring or simplistic, but is interjected in the film enough that it remains a focal point which pushes the film forward in many aspects. Overall, a must-see. Absolutely one of the best films I've ever watched.

    Gabbeh, is a very different film from other movies I have seen. I did not enjoy this movie as much as I thought I would. This movie requires focus from the viewer if you missed five minutes or did not give full attention to the beginning of this movie you would be lost. There are three main actors in this film but two of them are playing the same character at different times in the film. This movie revolves around an elderly couple washing a rug that displays the heritage and life of the female's family. As they wash the rug the younger version of the female appears, and begins to tell her long heart wrenching story of being in love with a man that she could not marry. The girl is very sad that her dad will not give her permission to marry the man she is in love with. He stalls the approval and wedding ceremony by telling her that she will have to wait until her middle aged uncle gets married. However, her uncle had many criteria's that had to be met before he would take any female as his wife. They ended up searching everywhere until finally they found his match by a stream. Her celebrations are short lived because her dad makes another stipulation. The older version of her lover begins to question the young female claims of actually being in love with him in the past. He does it in the most peculiar voice which I found captivating, but it did little to keep my interest. The scenery was also beautiful throughout the movie, the colors and the way it was showcased was fascinating. I did enjoy some of the cultural details in this movie and found the rug making fascinating, but I do not feel that watching the experience was enough to recommend this movie.

    Right after I finished watching the film, I didn't care for it. I was slightly confused throughout, this may have been because I was distracted, not focusing as much as I should have, but I just didn't feel a connection to it. However, after the screening of this in my film class, I overheard other students talking about how much they liked the film and I decided to research it more. My interpretation is that the old couple is the present day version of the young lovers but, I have read mixed thoughts on this. Makhmalbaf's use of color is visually stunning in the film. He uses it to express mood, and as the characters yell in the film, "color is life!" I am still confused as to what the young woman represented. Did she actually exist? Was she the younger version of the old woman? Was she a complete visualization? This may be ignorant of me because I may need to go back and watch the film again to really have a firm opinion on this film. The most innovative scene in my opinion was the scene in which the man is teaching the young children about colors and reaches out to them, bringing his hand back in and having the color all over it. This was such a modern thing to do but it somehow fit so well into the film. Makhmalbaf did such an amazing job combining the culture with modern touches like color or modern film techniques. For me, that was the biggest message I'll take from this film. I will surely need to have a second viewing before making any definite opinions on the plot.

    Mohsen Makhmalbaf's Iranian sensation known as Gabbeh is a fantastic film that features a mythical young woman who is longing to be married to a certain horseback stranger from another clan. Gabbeh is spoken in their native language of Arabic, with English subtitles to make sure we understand. This is the story of the young woman named Gabbeh, who is played by Shaghayeh Djodat, wants nothing more than to get married to this horseback stranger, but there is one problem with her plan. Her uncle, played by Abbas Sayah, doesn't permit her to do so until he gets married first before her. But out of nowhere this mythical young woman appears when an elderly couple goes through their routine of cleaning their rug, while squabbling gently with each other. The Gabbeh's story is almost like a fairytale other than the actuality encompasses the old woman's real-life struggle with daily life and accomplishing her aspiration of matrimony. The director hides his analysis by the usage of colors, which is dominant throughout the entire movie. The vibrant colors that the women wear in the movie are a foundation of unity for women and give them an opening to express themselves in the patriarchal culture. This love story has a hint into a society that has Westerners, whom we have misconceptions or have stereotypes about. This is the first film I've seen from their region and it is a quite odd, but yet entertaining film. I'm expecting to see more films from this region or from this director. This director did a great job with this film with the use of vibrant colors as well as a great love story as well as what happens in the life of Gabbeh or others that are just like her. Overall this film got my attention.

He uses it to express mood, and as the characters yell in the film, "color is life!" I am still confused as to what the young woman represented. Did she actually exist? Was she the younger version of the old woman? Was she a complete visualization? This may be ignorant of me because I may need to go back and watch the film again to really have a firm opinion on this film. The most innovative scene in my opinion was the scene in which the man is teaching the young children about colors and reaches out to them, bringing his hand back in and having the color all over it. This was such a modern thing to do but it somehow fit so well into the film. Makhmalbaf did such an amazing job combining the culture with modern touches like color or modern film techniques. For me, that was the biggest message I'll take from this film. I will surely need to have a second viewing before making any definite opinions on the plot.

    Mohsen Makhmalbaf's Iranian sensation known as Gabbeh is a fantastic film that features a mythical young woman who is longing to be married to a certain horseback stranger from another clan. Gabbeh is spoken in their native language of Arabic, with English subtitles to make sure we understand. This is the story of the young woman named Gabbeh, who is played by Shaghayeh Djodat, wants nothing more than to get married to this horseback stranger, but there is one problem with her plan. Her uncle, played by Abbas Sayah, doesn't permit her to do so until he gets married first before her. But out of nowhere this mythical young woman appears when an elderly couple goes through their routine of cleaning their rug, while squabbling gently with each other. The Gabbeh's story is almost like a fairytale other than the actuality encompasses the old woman's real-life struggle with daily life and accomplishing her aspiration of matrimony. The director hides his analysis by the usage of colors, which is dominant throughout the entire movie. The vibrant colors that the women wear in the movie are a foundation of unity for women and give them an opening to express themselves in the patriarchal culture. This love story has a hint into a society that has Westerners, whom we have misconceptions or have stereotypes about. This is the first film I've seen from their region and it is a quite odd, but yet entertaining film. I'm expecting to see more films from this region or from this director. This director did a great job with this film with the use of vibrant colors as well as a great love story as well as what happens in the life of Gabbeh or others that are just like her. Overall this film got my attention.

    A carpet. Few stories as seeds of humanity. Waves of color. Shadows of existence. A huge carpet. Love as threads of this carpet. A parable, a fairy tale, fragment of a honeycomb with mythical honey. Picture of a world in which past and present are a single stitch carpet.Colors, faces music in a mixture who lives in roots of a way to see and describe the universe.. Traditions and games. Confesions of a spirit and water as Ariadne thread. And images. Seductive, fragile, powerful and harsh. Looks as signs of time who is almost piece of clay. A wonderful Iranian movie about the small eternal truth. Twoo old people. A carpet. And a story. The result - an overwhelming beauty.

    Gabbeh is proof that expensive and complicated effects like 3D are no match for pure creativity. Even if you don't understand Gabbeh, which I admit, it will probably take a few screenings before it really makes sense sometimes, the visually stunning aspects of the film were enough to keep the attention of me and my peers. This Iranian gem begs the audience to think less literally and to peer into a foreign society. Gabbeh is in love with a man, who is heard as a wolf's cry in the film, yet her father will not let her be with the man. Stunningly enough, even when the uncle closes his eyes to allow her to leave, Gabbeh stays, illustrating her fearful loyalty to her family and to her values. Throughout the movie a rug is made, a beautiful one at that, and certain colors are weaved in for certain things. To further this aspect, a man teaching children shows colors by pulling them directly from the earth. For example, the man reaches to the sky and pulls his hand back which is now blue, yet the man reaches into a field of red poppies and pulls back a handful of them. These are actually believable instances in the film, showing incredible strength in editing. In other aspects of the film, the landscape that the nomads follow is beautiful and intriguing, from rivers to snowy mountains. Throughout the movie there is a juxtaposition of the young couple's forbidden love with that of an old man and his old wife, who mostly complain and cry a lot. At the end of the film we realize that this is Gabbeh and her husband, who eventually end up together. This bit is a tad confusing, but requires perhaps a few more watches, as mentioned. If you stick with Gabbeh, you wont be disappointed, it is something quite different from anything else you will have seen.

    Repressive countries are by their nature, well, repressive. Freedom of speech is restrained and, thereby, styles of expression as well. This clearly creates a situation where the arts are stunted in their growth. A country with a particular policy would only want their artists to create art which makes sense to both the general population and the ideal the government wants to propagate to that population. To make a film about a contrary topic, or even in an unusual style, could confuse, offend, or subvert people, which the government would not want. Gabbeh, a film from Iran, is a good example of this, as it's very much a film of its place. It is mild, inoffensive, and contains numerous images of a tradition Iranian culture, depicted in a warm and perhaps domineering way. I would almost see it as a promotion of the country. Now the story of the movie follows young woman hoping to marry someone from another tribe, yet many different obstacles stand in her way, obstacles which may sound pretty strange to us, but apparently have some sort of meaning in the culture. For one thing, her uncle has yet to be married. But, at 57, he sure is taking his time! And, then, even after he finally gets hitched, she is told she cannot be married until they complete a long trek and a lot of work. Eventually, however, she defies these constant hindrances, and by doing so, may pay a price. One of the biggest parts of this movie that were great in my opinion, was that of the colors used in this movie, the use of colors to signify many things was brilliant and it brought the movie a better lighting that we haven't seen in movies to much before.

    I found "Gabbeh" boring. It was nearly impossible for me to sit through. There was no excitement. In this film, the director is an artist. Mosen Makhmalbaf does a great job on using colors throughout the movie, but that's the only good thing that I saw. The costumes, the Persian carpet, the sky and landscape vividly show Mosen Makhmalbaf's use of color. I didn't really understand the story at all. Other than the colors, the movie has nothing going for itself. The story wasn't interesting and I didn't feel engaged at all. I will never watch this film again. I get that Mosen Makhmalbaf wanted to display a work of art, but when half of the class is completely clueless there is confusion behind the meaning of the story, don't you think something is wrong?

    The Gabbeh, a type of hand-woven rug made by the Nomadic tribes of the Middle East, is the name and main focus point of the recently released film "Gabbeh". The film starts as the Gabbeh drifts through a shallow river, an old couple, are attempting to cleanse the rug. As the women begins to clean the rug, the spirit of a young girl, perhaps the old lady as a young women, springs from the rug, the young girl says that the rug used to belong to her tribe, and that the rug tells the story of her tribe. The girls tribe is very family oriented, the girl wish to marry, but is told that she cannot, not till her uncle marries. Time passes and the girl's fianc&eacute;/lover follows her tribe on horseback, they finally find a wife for her husband, when her father adds another stipulation. The girl's mother is once again pregnant and the girl, being one of the oldest daughters cannot marry or leave the tribe till her mother has the baby. While this may seem mean of the father, to place all these obstacles in the way of his daughter's marriage, he may have just been ensuring that the man on horseback really wants to marry his daughter; that this man will not just run off at the first sign of trouble or hardship. This could be the father's way of ensuring that the man is serious in his intent to marry the girl. All through the film the fianc&eacute;/ lover follows the tribe remaining faithful to his betrothed. The girl finally decides to run off with her fianc&eacute;/lover, and I can't help but think that is exactly what the father wanted, he was unable to physically let his daughter go, so he forced upon her situations, in which the only way she could truly get what she wanted was by running.

    I pretty much hated this film. I didn't really get the story until I was well within twenty minutes of the film. Yeah, I guess you can say that the colors were really nice. But if that is the basis of the film, if that is the only superb thing about it, then that is really really bad. And that is about what I thought of it. Colors were nice, but the overall film just sucked. It was beyond boring, half the time it is just this old man and old woman washing some rugs. It is completely uninteresting. I mean I guess it is just a generational thing but I mean if the story is even a little interesting I will pay attention and enjoy it. But this film was just not engaging, the story was not interesting. It is hard to appreciate a work of art, which is what I think the filmmaker was going for, without a decent, engaging story.

    This is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Gabbeh, an Iranian film which chronicles the complex life of a young girl and her family who live in the mountains of Iran herding goats, is told with such conviction and simplicity, that it is hard not to fall in love with this film. The narrative displays non-Western conventions, while remaining simple and easy to follow for a Western audience. It is actually quite refreshing to see a film that is told in the way Gabbeh is told. The content of the film is brilliant, with themes of nature, life's beauty and misfortune and complex family relationships. The use of color, which is arguably one of the most unique and interesting features of this film, warrant at least one viewing, if not multiple. Also, using the rug, or, gabbeh, as the film's centerpiece is a wonderful visual anchor, and reads well for a Western audience. If the story is not enough to sell this film, the cinematography more than makes up for any mistakes this film has. The film is short enough that the pastoral imagery remains beautiful and not boring or simplistic, but is interjected in the film enough that it remains a focal point which pushes the film forward in many aspects. Overall, a must-see. Absolutely one of the best films I've ever watched.

    Gabbeh, is a very different film from other movies I have seen. I did not enjoy this movie as much as I thought I would. This movie requires focus from the viewer if you missed five minutes or did not give full attention to the beginning of this movie you would be lost. There are three main actors in this film but two of them are playing the same character at different times in the film. This movie revolves around an elderly couple washing a rug that displays the heritage and life of the female's family. As they wash the rug the younger version of the female appears, and begins to tell her long heart wrenching story of being in love with a man that she could not marry. The girl is very sad that her dad will not give her permission to marry the man she is in love with. He stalls the approval and wedding ceremony by telling her that she will have to wait until her middle aged uncle gets married. However, her uncle had many criteria's that had to be met before he would take any female as his wife. They ended up searching everywhere until finally they found his match by a stream. Her celebrations are short lived because her dad makes another stipulation. The older version of her lover begins to question the young female claims of actually being in love with him in the past. He does it in the most peculiar voice which I found captivating, but it did little to keep my interest. The scenery was also beautiful throughout the movie, the colors and the way it was showcased was fascinating. I did enjoy some of the cultural details in this movie and found the rug making fascinating, but I do not feel that watching the experience was enough to recommend this movie.

    Right after I finished watching the film, I didn't care for it. I was slightly confused throughout, this may have been because I was distracted, not focusing as much as I should have, but I just didn't feel a connection to it. However, after the screening of this in my film class, I overheard other students talking about how much they liked the film and I decided to research it more. My interpretation is that the old couple is the present day version of the young lovers but, I have read mixed thoughts on this. Makhmalbaf's use of color is visually stunning in the film.

    Right after I finished watching the film, I didn't care for it. I was slightly confused throughout, this may have been because I was distracted, not focusing as much as I should have, but I just didn't feel a connection to it. However, after the screening of this in my film class, I overheard other students talking about how much they liked the film and I decided to research it more. My interpretation is that the old couple is the present day version of the young lovers but, I have read mixed thoughts on this. Makhmalbaf's use of color is visually stunning in the film. He uses it to express mood, and as the characters yell in the film, "color is life!" I am still confused as to what the young woman represented. Did she actually exist? Was she the younger version of the old woman? Was she a complete visualization? This may be ignorant of me because I may need to go back and watch the film again to really have a firm opinion on this film. The most innovative scene in my opinion was the scene in which the man is teaching the young children about colors and reaches out to them, bringing his hand back in and having the color all over it. This was such a modern thing to do but it somehow fit so well into the film. Makhmalbaf did such an amazing job combining the culture with modern touches like color or modern film techniques. For me, that was the biggest message I'll take from this film. I will surely need to have a second viewing before making any definite opinions on the plot.

    Mohsen Makhmalbaf's Iranian sensation known as Gabbeh is a fantastic film that features a mythical young woman who is longing to be married to a certain horseback stranger from another clan. Gabbeh is spoken in their native language of Arabic, with English subtitles to make sure we understand. This is the story of the young woman named Gabbeh, who is played by Shaghayeh Djodat, wants nothing more than to get married to this horseback stranger, but there is one problem with her plan. Her uncle, played by Abbas Sayah, doesn't permit her to do so until he gets married first before her. But out of nowhere this mythical young woman appears when an elderly couple goes through their routine of cleaning their rug, while squabbling gently with each other. The Gabbeh's story is almost like a fairytale other than the actuality encompasses the old woman's real-life struggle with daily life and accomplishing her aspiration of matrimony. The director hides his analysis by the usage of colors, which is dominant throughout the entire movie. The vibrant colors that the women wear in the movie are a foundation of unity for women and give them an opening to express themselves in the patriarchal culture. This love story has a hint into a society that has Westerners, whom we have misconceptions or have stereotypes about. This is the first film I've seen from their region and it is a quite odd, but yet entertaining film. I'm expecting to see more films from this region or from this director. This director did a great job with this film with the use of vibrant colors as well as a great love story as well as what happens in the life of Gabbeh or others that are just like her. Overall this film got my attention.
