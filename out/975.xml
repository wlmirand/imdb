 <sinopse>
  A 16 year old girl takes up with a charming young man who quickly shows his colors when he beats a friend simply for walking with her and then goes totally ballistic after she tries to break up with him.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  On the surface, the Walkers were a picture perfect family. Steve had a great job as an architect and a beautiful house in Seattle overlooking a lake. His new wife, Laura, loved him very much. Toby, her young son, looked up to him like his own father. And Nicole, his 16-year old daughter, meant the world to him. As Steve would be the first to admit, it was almost the perfect life. Until one day when Nicole went to a party at a local rave club with her best friend Margo and met a young man named David.

    This is probably one of my favorite movies. Why? Because men like this EXIST IN REAL LIFE. Being a residential counselor and seeing men behave this way - it is completely realistic. The psychological background completes Mark Wahlberg's character development. The upbringing and dialog corresponds to the promiscuous friend's behavior Played by Alyssa Milano. This is the most under-rated movie. Mark Wahlberg shines in this one. There is one particular scene in this movie that is still stuck in my head which rarely happens. The few lines from Mark Wahlberg are so poetically psychotic it leaves you thinking for hours (or even days) after the credits role - which is what a movie is supposed to do. A movie is supposed to send a message and expand your awareness. This is the most under-rated movie and a must watch. It's 2013 and this 1996 script still resonates a fresh tone in today's world.

    A straight forward girl meets boy, girl and boy split up and one get very mad picture. Fear is A surprisingly Dark Psychological thriller. With moments of sex and violence that were more graphic than what i was expecting. The cast showed early signs of the talents and stars they would become, Alyssa Milano for me giving the best performance in her small role in the movie. I enjoyed the father - daughter relationship which seemed realistic. The Direction of the film was on point and the action in the film keeps things moving along at a steady pace, and the tension building towards a reasonably satisfying climax. negatively, i did not enjoy the soundtrack, as individual songs i may have enjoyed them, but they did not build tension and seemed to not match the action taking place, moments in the story came off as silly especially a sexual assault confusingly being seen as a legitimate consensual sex act. Also as a whole i did enjoy the performances but never really found Mark Wahlberg's early sensitive side in the picture as true. On the whole i did enjoy the film, but still would have to give an average rating.

    Seventeen years ago this might have been classed as very good but by today's standards it's merely good. Almost all of the actors are well known, well certainly better known now than back then and their acting too has come a long way. Look at Mark Wahlberg, in my opinion he has proved himself over and over to the stage that he's up there with the best and is a very dedicated actor. From the likes of PT Anderson's wonderful 'Boogie Nights' to his comedic talents in 'Ted' I enjoy most of his work. I watched 'This Means War' just before this, with Reese Witherspoon and I really enjoyed her performance in it and while she was good in this she is a million times better in a comedy. She looks great too. The direction in this was exceedingly uninspired as was the cinematography and even the production, the general look and feel of this was a touch generic. It badly lacked style of which a heavy dose would have gone a long way but again, I might be seeing all the flaws that passing time allows us to focus on. If you haven't seen this and are a more casual film goer then you could do a lot worse. If, however you seen it years ago and your curious don't be, you'll just find it tedious and mind numbingly predictable. Score: 6.5/10 e-mail: 'Nav Q' - navq@ymail.com

    Referred to by its own producer, Brian Grazer, as a "Fatal Attraction" for teens, this slick thriller holds no surprises but is still reasonably good visceral entertainment. Reese Witherspoon plays Nicole, a Typical Teen with an Overprotective Dad, Steve (William Petersen). Nicole chances to meet a hunky stranger named David (Mark Wahlberg, in one of his earliest starring gigs) and they enter into a passionate relationship, only for Nicole to realize that every suspicion that her dad has about her boyfriend is correct: the guy's a brutal, controlling thug. And he naturally doesn't take kindly to being dumped. Simply put, this is the kind of cretin who simply won't be denied what he wants. And he'll kill anybody to get it. "Fear" does benefit from very capable direction by James Foley ("Glengarry Glen Ross"), and impressive widescreen photography. This story does move along quite well without getting bogged down in any sort of filler. It's also quite sexy, to boot: Nicole and David have some steamy couplings along the way. The action gravitates right toward the kind of final showdown that we know from the start is going to be inevitable. As it happens, Steve foolishly gives Davids' equally seedy goon friends all the motivation they need to launch an assault on the family home. The movie is certainly well cast and all of the performances are effective. Also among the actors are Alyssa Milano as Witherspoons' friend and Amy Brenneman as the dads' new lady friend. Witherspoon is appealing and Wahlberg is convincing as the lovestruck antagonist. Overall this works pretty well at manipulating its audience and getting them all cranked up. The big finale is reasonably exciting and has some brutal moments. While this might not be innovative stuff in any way, it does do its job, and delivers the expected thrills. Seven out of 10.

    "Fear" is a slightly-above average thriller at best, boasting fine performances from Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon and William Petersen. Nicole Walker is sixteen years-old and living with her businessman father and step-mother and brother in a luxurious, well fortified and secure pad. When reluctantly skipping school one day with her rebellious friends, she spots the hunk David McCall (Mark Wahlberg) - wearing a tight black sweater to accentuate them pecs, of course, playing pool with his misfit, drug-addled pals. She later meets him at a rave, and before long, they are dating. David is perfect, it seems. He's strong, caring, sweet and gentle, and Nicole falls in love with him. But it isn't long before David's true colours start to show. And when she ends it with him, he begins to stalk her before eventually, he gets nasty... "Fear" runs smoothly at a nice pace over a very agreeable run-time. Mark Wahlberg is superb as a psychopath, while Reese Witherspoon is believable as a naive and innocent sixteen year-old girl (Considering she was 20 at the time). William Petersen, best known for his career with "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", is commendable as he gives Dustin Hoffman's heroics in "Straw Dogs" a run for it's money at the end. Overall, this is a decent thriller, albeit nothing special really. It's pretty tense in parts, but Wahlberg's performance was really key to this films success.

    There's a lot about "Fear" that's pretty clich&eacute;. The charming boyfriend who turns out to be a controlling, violent, psychopathic, obsessive guy who can't let go of the girl he's "fallen in love" with in spite of the fact that neither she nor her family want him around anymore. I can't say that struck me as particularly creative, nor did I find the bulk of the story especially interesting. It does, however, have some things going for it. First, I have to give credit to Drew Barrymore and Mark Wahlberg. Setting aside the fact that both were a little older than the characters they were playing, they were quite good in their roles as the young & naive Nicole and the charming psychopath David who sweeps her off her feet. Both were in the very early stages of their respective acting careers, but the lack of experience didn't show. They were convincing. The rest of the cast didn't really measure up to their standards, but the characters were interesting enough. I could certainly relate to William Petersen as Nicole's dad as he gets more and more concerned about this relationship his daughter is having, even though for some reason Petersen didn't really strike home with me in the role. And I have to say that although the movie almost lost me with the silly scene where David tattoos "Nicole 4 Eva" on his own chest, and while most of the story really didn't make that much of a connection with me, the last 20 minutes or so turns out to be a pretty good ride. It also is pretty standard for this kind of movie - as Nicole's entire family ends up doing battle with David and the bad guys, etc., etc., but it was very well done and exciting. This isn't a bad movie. It's perhaps a bit too much driven by clich&eacute;s and a storyline that isn't very original, but it's well made and it has enough to keep the viewer interested. (6/10)

    In 1996, James Foley directed a movie called "Fear." If there is any irony to be found in that title, it may very well be in that Mr. Foley would have had reason to be concerned about his career after making this mindless, overproduced piece of garbage. Five years earlier, now-famous Reese Witherspoon made her debut in a wonderful movie called "The Man in the Moon." In both that film and this one, she played a teenager troubled by her crush on a boy. Except in that much-superior film, it was because her crush was three years older than her and he was smitten by her sister. In this film, it's because he's a sex-addicted psychopath who won't leave her be. "Fear" could be described as an adolescent version of "Fatal Attraction." But there is a difference. Up until its last ten minutes, "Fatal Attraction" was a splendid thriller as well as an insightful one. It had a sharp, shrewd knowledge about marital affairs. Hence why Glenn Close still claims to this day that her performance stopped several men from cheating on their wives. That movie did lose its mind in its big climactic ending, but "Fear" is a movie born without a mind. And if you thought the ending to "Fatal Attraction" was ludicrous, wait until you get a load of what happens here. One of the core faults of the picture is lack of a demanding villain. I've had mixed feelings about Mark Wahlberg before, but this could be his worst performance. As the stalking boyfriend with a household of hoods, he's about as frightening as the stone lions in front of a library. There are two sides to Mr. Wahlberg's performance, one worse than the other. When his character goes psychotic at the end, it's just limp ham-acting. But he's worse at the beginning, when he's pretending to be a nice guy just by speaking softly and hanging his eyelids as if he had insomnia. But I guess Mr. Wahlberg, who can act when given a worthy screenplay, cannot be fully blamed here. For I doubt this material could have been handled well by any actor, young or old. Because I was not the least bit intimidated or frightened by him, I saw no reason why Miss Witherspoon, or her parents or friends, would be, either. However, the worst sin the movie commits is insincerity. It is tackling a very topical and relevant collection of subject matter: underage sex, early-age affection, the tough times between parents and children at that crucial age of sixteen. But instead of offering insight about these tough times--that everyone of us can relate to in one way or another--it just pushes those opportunities aside in favor of over-the-top exploitation. Take, for example, the denouement of the picture. Instead of going for a plausible conclusion, the movie goes into a cheesy monster-on-the-loose formula, which very well have been a parody of "Night of the Living Dead." This is the sort of film where four teenage boys have been granted special powers like second lives and super-human strength. They apparently also become master electricians and know more about architecture than the designer of a maximum security system. How do they acquire this vast array of skills? By doing drugs, raping high school girls, and playing lots of pool. I don't buy it. The movie is so unconsciously bad that it is always racing ahead of itself. Even a scene such as a jogger running through some woods (not chased by a bad guy, by the way) is accompanied by whooshing camera motions and a soundtrack so noisy that it would make the world's most obnoxious rock band ask for a little quiet time. I suppose if there was any good intentions from the makers of the movie, it would have been along the lines of Larry Clark's "Kids" released a year before. But whereas that film had a purpose, "Fear" just pretends to have a purpose.

    Over the years, I've developed quite an aversion to Mark Wahlberg for various reasons: the guy was the front-man for quite possibly the suckiest boy-band of the 90s; he speaks with an irritatingly soft voice; his hair is crap; he starred in the awful Four Brothers, dreadful Planet of the Apes and dreary The Yards; he got to have on-screen sex with Heather Graham and Julianne Moore in Boogie Nights, and in Fear, he gets to break-in a jailbaitalicious Reese Witherspoon and screw a slutty Alyssa Milano. Tell me, what's to like about the guy? Fortunately, in Fear, where Wahlberg plays despicable psycho David, who makes life absolute hell for pretty schoolgirl Nicole Walker (Witherspoon), her friends and family, a general disdain of the actor, compounded with a hatred for his character, makes this movie an all the more intense and enjoyable experience: after having Witherspoon and Milano lounge around in bikinis, Milano bending over in a very short skirt, step-milf Laura Walker (Amy Brenneman) in a sexy one-piece, Witherspoon orgasming (with a little help from David) while riding a roller-coaster, Gary's neck snapped like a twig, and The Walker's pet dog Kaiser's decapitated noggin pushed through its dog-flap during a tense siege/home invasion, what better way for director James Foley to end his film than by launching Wahlberg through a first storey window to land face-down on the rocks below?

    Mindless cheesy teenage fun. Marky mark's facial expressions make the whole thing worth it. Reese wanders about in a pretty convincing manner. The friends are contrived and fantastically cookie cutter 90's punks, so that was funny. My main complaint is plot holes. Ending is kind of silly. Successful father with fortress like house doesn't own a gun or a cell phone? If Dad had pulled a Glock it would've been the shortest conclusion in all of cinema. They also own the worst German shepard in history. I've been around these dogs. Sneaking around in the bushes with 7 other strange guys is a shortcut to a removed jugular.

    This movie is way too predictable to be able to be enjoyed. You can see everything coming a mile away. Isn't that the antithesis of what a suspense film should be? Shouldn't I be surprised when something happens? After all, isn't suspense just a feeling you get when you're not sure what's about to happen? If so, it would seem the word and the movie are a contradiction in terms. The acting is pretty stale as far as I'm concerned. Reese Witherspoon plays the pretty idiot. She doesn't really have that much to say in this movie, even though she's basically the main character. As far as Mark Wahlberg is concerned...Man, oh man, is he a terrible actor or what? I seriously don't see what other people like about him. I think this movie would've been better than it was had they been able to find a better actor to play Wahlberg's character. What was it I didn't like about Wahlberg's performance? Well, for starters...His "good guy" persona was way too transparent. You'd have to be a complete moron to not know this guy was a fake. The pickup lines he was feeding Reese were being put on so thick I about wanted to hurl...Why do girls buy this kind of crap? Meanwhile, his "bad guy" wasn't very intimidating as far as I'm concerned. If I would've been Reese's dad, I would've opened a can of a whoop-ass on Mr. Marky Mark here. Overall, this movie is a "by the numbers" suspense flick. Nothing new. No surprises. No suspense. I'd recommend passing it up. This is just a stupid movie and a big waste of time.

Five years earlier, now-famous Reese Witherspoon made her debut in a wonderful movie called "The Man in the Moon." In both that film and this one, she played a teenager troubled by her crush on a boy. Except in that much-superior film, it was because her crush was three years older than her and he was smitten by her sister. In this film, it's because he's a sex-addicted psychopath who won't leave her be. "Fear" could be described as an adolescent version of "Fatal Attraction." But there is a difference. Up until its last ten minutes, "Fatal Attraction" was a splendid thriller as well as an insightful one. It had a sharp, shrewd knowledge about marital affairs. Hence why Glenn Close still claims to this day that her performance stopped several men from cheating on their wives. That movie did lose its mind in its big climactic ending, but "Fear" is a movie born without a mind. And if you thought the ending to "Fatal Attraction" was ludicrous, wait until you get a load of what happens here. One of the core faults of the picture is lack of a demanding villain. I've had mixed feelings about Mark Wahlberg before, but this could be his worst performance. As the stalking boyfriend with a household of hoods, he's about as frightening as the stone lions in front of a library. There are two sides to Mr. Wahlberg's performance, one worse than the other. When his character goes psychotic at the end, it's just limp ham-acting. But he's worse at the beginning, when he's pretending to be a nice guy just by speaking softly and hanging his eyelids as if he had insomnia. But I guess Mr. Wahlberg, who can act when given a worthy screenplay, cannot be fully blamed here. For I doubt this material could have been handled well by any actor, young or old. Because I was not the least bit intimidated or frightened by him, I saw no reason why Miss Witherspoon, or her parents or friends, would be, either. However, the worst sin the movie commits is insincerity. It is tackling a very topical and relevant collection of subject matter: underage sex, early-age affection, the tough times between parents and children at that crucial age of sixteen. But instead of offering insight about these tough times--that everyone of us can relate to in one way or another--it just pushes those opportunities aside in favor of over-the-top exploitation. Take, for example, the denouement of the picture. Instead of going for a plausible conclusion, the movie goes into a cheesy monster-on-the-loose formula, which very well have been a parody of "Night of the Living Dead." This is the sort of film where four teenage boys have been granted special powers like second lives and super-human strength. They apparently also become master electricians and know more about architecture than the designer of a maximum security system. How do they acquire this vast array of skills? By doing drugs, raping high school girls, and playing lots of pool. I don't buy it. The movie is so unconsciously bad that it is always racing ahead of itself. Even a scene such as a jogger running through some woods (not chased by a bad guy, by the way) is accompanied by whooshing camera motions and a soundtrack so noisy that it would make the world's most obnoxious rock band ask for a little quiet time. I suppose if there was any good intentions from the makers of the movie, it would have been along the lines of Larry Clark's "Kids" released a year before. But whereas that film had a purpose, "Fear" just pretends to have a purpose.

    Over the years, I've developed quite an aversion to Mark Wahlberg for various reasons: the guy was the front-man for quite possibly the suckiest boy-band of the 90s; he speaks with an irritatingly soft voice; his hair is crap; he starred in the awful Four Brothers, dreadful Planet of the Apes and dreary The Yards; he got to have on-screen sex with Heather Graham and Julianne Moore in Boogie Nights, and in Fear, he gets to break-in a jailbaitalicious Reese Witherspoon and screw a slutty Alyssa Milano. Tell me, what's to like about the guy? Fortunately, in Fear, where Wahlberg plays despicable psycho David, who makes life absolute hell for pretty schoolgirl Nicole Walker (Witherspoon), her friends and family, a general disdain of the actor, compounded with a hatred for his character, makes this movie an all the more intense and enjoyable experience: after having Witherspoon and Milano lounge around in bikinis, Milano bending over in a very short skirt, step-milf Laura Walker (Amy Brenneman) in a sexy one-piece, Witherspoon orgasming (with a little help from David) while riding a roller-coaster, Gary's neck snapped like a twig, and The Walker's pet dog Kaiser's decapitated noggin pushed through its dog-flap during a tense siege/home invasion, what better way for director James Foley to end his film than by launching Wahlberg through a first storey window to land face-down on the rocks below?

    Mindless cheesy teenage fun. Marky mark's facial expressions make the whole thing worth it. Reese wanders about in a pretty convincing manner. The friends are contrived and fantastically cookie cutter 90's punks, so that was funny. My main complaint is plot holes. Ending is kind of silly. Successful father with fortress like house doesn't own a gun or a cell phone? If Dad had pulled a Glock it would've been the shortest conclusion in all of cinema. They also own the worst German shepard in history. I've been around these dogs. Sneaking around in the bushes with 7 other strange guys is a shortcut to a removed jugular.

    This movie is way too predictable to be able to be enjoyed. You can see everything coming a mile away. Isn't that the antithesis of what a suspense film should be? Shouldn't I be surprised when something happens? After all, isn't suspense just a feeling you get when you're not sure what's about to happen? If so, it would seem the word and the movie are a contradiction in terms. The acting is pretty stale as far as I'm concerned. Reese Witherspoon plays the pretty idiot. She doesn't really have that much to say in this movie, even though she's basically the main character. As far as Mark Wahlberg is concerned...Man, oh man, is he a terrible actor or what? I seriously don't see what other people like about him. I think this movie would've been better than it was had they been able to find a better actor to play Wahlberg's character. What was it I didn't like about Wahlberg's performance? Well, for starters...His "good guy" persona was way too transparent. You'd have to be a complete moron to not know this guy was a fake. The pickup lines he was feeding Reese were being put on so thick I about wanted to hurl...Why do girls buy this kind of crap? Meanwhile, his "bad guy" wasn't very intimidating as far as I'm concerned. If I would've been Reese's dad, I would've opened a can of a whoop-ass on Mr. Marky Mark here. Overall, this movie is a "by the numbers" suspense flick. Nothing new. No surprises. No suspense. I'd recommend passing it up. This is just a stupid movie and a big waste of time.

    This is probably one of my favorite movies. Why? Because men like this EXIST IN REAL LIFE. Being a residential counselor and seeing men behave this way - it is completely realistic. The psychological background completes Mark Wahlberg's character development. The upbringing and dialog corresponds to the promiscuous friend's behavior Played by Alyssa Milano. This is the most under-rated movie. Mark Wahlberg shines in this one. There is one particular scene in this movie that is still stuck in my head which rarely happens. The few lines from Mark Wahlberg are so poetically psychotic it leaves you thinking for hours (or even days) after the credits role - which is what a movie is supposed to do. A movie is supposed to send a message and expand your awareness. This is the most under-rated movie and a must watch. It's 2013 and this 1996 script still resonates a fresh tone in today's world.

    A straight forward girl meets boy, girl and boy split up and one get very mad picture. Fear is A surprisingly Dark Psychological thriller. With moments of sex and violence that were more graphic than what i was expecting. The cast showed early signs of the talents and stars they would become, Alyssa Milano for me giving the best performance in her small role in the movie. I enjoyed the father - daughter relationship which seemed realistic. The Direction of the film was on point and the action in the film keeps things moving along at a steady pace, and the tension building towards a reasonably satisfying climax. negatively, i did not enjoy the soundtrack, as individual songs i may have enjoyed them, but they did not build tension and seemed to not match the action taking place, moments in the story came off as silly especially a sexual assault confusingly being seen as a legitimate consensual sex act. Also as a whole i did enjoy the performances but never really found Mark Wahlberg's early sensitive side in the picture as true. On the whole i did enjoy the film, but still would have to give an average rating.

    Seventeen years ago this might have been classed as very good but by today's standards it's merely good. Almost all of the actors are well known, well certainly better known now than back then and their acting too has come a long way. Look at Mark Wahlberg, in my opinion he has proved himself over and over to the stage that he's up there with the best and is a very dedicated actor. From the likes of PT Anderson's wonderful 'Boogie Nights' to his comedic talents in 'Ted' I enjoy most of his work. I watched 'This Means War' just before this, with Reese Witherspoon and I really enjoyed her performance in it and while she was good in this she is a million times better in a comedy. She looks great too. The direction in this was exceedingly uninspired as was the cinematography and even the production, the general look and feel of this was a touch generic. It badly lacked style of which a heavy dose would have gone a long way but again, I might be seeing all the flaws that passing time allows us to focus on. If you haven't seen this and are a more casual film goer then you could do a lot worse. If, however you seen it years ago and your curious don't be, you'll just find it tedious and mind numbingly predictable. Score: 6.5/10 e-mail: 'Nav Q' - navq@ymail.com

    Referred to by its own producer, Brian Grazer, as a "Fatal Attraction" for teens, this slick thriller holds no surprises but is still reasonably good visceral entertainment. Reese Witherspoon plays Nicole, a Typical Teen with an Overprotective Dad, Steve (William Petersen). Nicole chances to meet a hunky stranger named David (Mark Wahlberg, in one of his earliest starring gigs) and they enter into a passionate relationship, only for Nicole to realize that every suspicion that her dad has about her boyfriend is correct: the guy's a brutal, controlling thug. And he naturally doesn't take kindly to being dumped. Simply put, this is the kind of cretin who simply won't be denied what he wants. And he'll kill anybody to get it. "Fear" does benefit from very capable direction by James Foley ("Glengarry Glen Ross"), and impressive widescreen photography. This story does move along quite well without getting bogged down in any sort of filler. It's also quite sexy, to boot: Nicole and David have some steamy couplings along the way. The action gravitates right toward the kind of final showdown that we know from the start is going to be inevitable. As it happens, Steve foolishly gives Davids' equally seedy goon friends all the motivation they need to launch an assault on the family home. The movie is certainly well cast and all of the performances are effective. Also among the actors are Alyssa Milano as Witherspoons' friend and Amy Brenneman as the dads' new lady friend. Witherspoon is appealing and Wahlberg is convincing as the lovestruck antagonist. Overall this works pretty well at manipulating its audience and getting them all cranked up. The big finale is reasonably exciting and has some brutal moments. While this might not be innovative stuff in any way, it does do its job, and delivers the expected thrills. Seven out of 10.

    "Fear" is a slightly-above average thriller at best, boasting fine performances from Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon and William Petersen. Nicole Walker is sixteen years-old and living with her businessman father and step-mother and brother in a luxurious, well fortified and secure pad. When reluctantly skipping school one day with her rebellious friends, she spots the hunk David McCall (Mark Wahlberg) - wearing a tight black sweater to accentuate them pecs, of course, playing pool with his misfit, drug-addled pals. She later meets him at a rave, and before long, they are dating. David is perfect, it seems. He's strong, caring, sweet and gentle, and Nicole falls in love with him. But it isn't long before David's true colours start to show. And when she ends it with him, he begins to stalk her before eventually, he gets nasty... "Fear" runs smoothly at a nice pace over a very agreeable run-time. Mark Wahlberg is superb as a psychopath, while Reese Witherspoon is believable as a naive and innocent sixteen year-old girl (Considering she was 20 at the time). William Petersen, best known for his career with "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", is commendable as he gives Dustin Hoffman's heroics in "Straw Dogs" a run for it's money at the end. Overall, this is a decent thriller, albeit nothing special really. It's pretty tense in parts, but Wahlberg's performance was really key to this films success.

    There's a lot about "Fear" that's pretty clich&eacute;. The charming boyfriend who turns out to be a controlling, violent, psychopathic, obsessive guy who can't let go of the girl he's "fallen in love" with in spite of the fact that neither she nor her family want him around anymore. I can't say that struck me as particularly creative, nor did I find the bulk of the story especially interesting. It does, however, have some things going for it. First, I have to give credit to Drew Barrymore and Mark Wahlberg. Setting aside the fact that both were a little older than the characters they were playing, they were quite good in their roles as the young & naive Nicole and the charming psychopath David who sweeps her off her feet. Both were in the very early stages of their respective acting careers, but the lack of experience didn't show. They were convincing. The rest of the cast didn't really measure up to their standards, but the characters were interesting enough. I could certainly relate to William Petersen as Nicole's dad as he gets more and more concerned about this relationship his daughter is having, even though for some reason Petersen didn't really strike home with me in the role. And I have to say that although the movie almost lost me with the silly scene where David tattoos "Nicole 4 Eva" on his own chest, and while most of the story really didn't make that much of a connection with me, the last 20 minutes or so turns out to be a pretty good ride. It also is pretty standard for this kind of movie - as Nicole's entire family ends up doing battle with David and the bad guys, etc., etc., but it was very well done and exciting. This isn't a bad movie. It's perhaps a bit too much driven by clich&eacute;s and a storyline that isn't very original, but it's well made and it has enough to keep the viewer interested. (6/10)

And he naturally doesn't take kindly to being dumped. Simply put, this is the kind of cretin who simply won't be denied what he wants. And he'll kill anybody to get it. "Fear" does benefit from very capable direction by James Foley ("Glengarry Glen Ross"), and impressive widescreen photography. This story does move along quite well without getting bogged down in any sort of filler. It's also quite sexy, to boot: Nicole and David have some steamy couplings along the way. The action gravitates right toward the kind of final showdown that we know from the start is going to be inevitable. As it happens, Steve foolishly gives Davids' equally seedy goon friends all the motivation they need to launch an assault on the family home. The movie is certainly well cast and all of the performances are effective. Also among the actors are Alyssa Milano as Witherspoons' friend and Amy Brenneman as the dads' new lady friend. Witherspoon is appealing and Wahlberg is convincing as the lovestruck antagonist. Overall this works pretty well at manipulating its audience and getting them all cranked up. The big finale is reasonably exciting and has some brutal moments. While this might not be innovative stuff in any way, it does do its job, and delivers the expected thrills. Seven out of 10.

    "Fear" is a slightly-above average thriller at best, boasting fine performances from Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon and William Petersen. Nicole Walker is sixteen years-old and living with her businessman father and step-mother and brother in a luxurious, well fortified and secure pad. When reluctantly skipping school one day with her rebellious friends, she spots the hunk David McCall (Mark Wahlberg) - wearing a tight black sweater to accentuate them pecs, of course, playing pool with his misfit, drug-addled pals. She later meets him at a rave, and before long, they are dating. David is perfect, it seems. He's strong, caring, sweet and gentle, and Nicole falls in love with him. But it isn't long before David's true colours start to show. And when she ends it with him, he begins to stalk her before eventually, he gets nasty... "Fear" runs smoothly at a nice pace over a very agreeable run-time. Mark Wahlberg is superb as a psychopath, while Reese Witherspoon is believable as a naive and innocent sixteen year-old girl (Considering she was 20 at the time). William Petersen, best known for his career with "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", is commendable as he gives Dustin Hoffman's heroics in "Straw Dogs" a run for it's money at the end. Overall, this is a decent thriller, albeit nothing special really. It's pretty tense in parts, but Wahlberg's performance was really key to this films success.

    There's a lot about "Fear" that's pretty clich&eacute;. The charming boyfriend who turns out to be a controlling, violent, psychopathic, obsessive guy who can't let go of the girl he's "fallen in love" with in spite of the fact that neither she nor her family want him around anymore. I can't say that struck me as particularly creative, nor did I find the bulk of the story especially interesting. It does, however, have some things going for it. First, I have to give credit to Drew Barrymore and Mark Wahlberg. Setting aside the fact that both were a little older than the characters they were playing, they were quite good in their roles as the young & naive Nicole and the charming psychopath David who sweeps her off her feet. Both were in the very early stages of their respective acting careers, but the lack of experience didn't show. They were convincing. The rest of the cast didn't really measure up to their standards, but the characters were interesting enough. I could certainly relate to William Petersen as Nicole's dad as he gets more and more concerned about this relationship his daughter is having, even though for some reason Petersen didn't really strike home with me in the role. And I have to say that although the movie almost lost me with the silly scene where David tattoos "Nicole 4 Eva" on his own chest, and while most of the story really didn't make that much of a connection with me, the last 20 minutes or so turns out to be a pretty good ride. It also is pretty standard for this kind of movie - as Nicole's entire family ends up doing battle with David and the bad guys, etc., etc., but it was very well done and exciting. This isn't a bad movie. It's perhaps a bit too much driven by clich&eacute;s and a storyline that isn't very original, but it's well made and it has enough to keep the viewer interested. (6/10)

    In 1996, James Foley directed a movie called "Fear." If there is any irony to be found in that title, it may very well be in that Mr. Foley would have had reason to be concerned about his career after making this mindless, overproduced piece of garbage. Five years earlier, now-famous Reese Witherspoon made her debut in a wonderful movie called "The Man in the Moon." In both that film and this one, she played a teenager troubled by her crush on a boy. Except in that much-superior film, it was because her crush was three years older than her and he was smitten by her sister. In this film, it's because he's a sex-addicted psychopath who won't leave her be. "Fear" could be described as an adolescent version of "Fatal Attraction." But there is a difference. Up until its last ten minutes, "Fatal Attraction" was a splendid thriller as well as an insightful one. It had a sharp, shrewd knowledge about marital affairs. Hence why Glenn Close still claims to this day that her performance stopped several men from cheating on their wives. That movie did lose its mind in its big climactic ending, but "Fear" is a movie born without a mind. And if you thought the ending to "Fatal Attraction" was ludicrous, wait until you get a load of what happens here. One of the core faults of the picture is lack of a demanding villain. I've had mixed feelings about Mark Wahlberg before, but this could be his worst performance. As the stalking boyfriend with a household of hoods, he's about as frightening as the stone lions in front of a library. There are two sides to Mr. Wahlberg's performance, one worse than the other. When his character goes psychotic at the end, it's just limp ham-acting. But he's worse at the beginning, when he's pretending to be a nice guy just by speaking softly and hanging his eyelids as if he had insomnia. But I guess Mr. Wahlberg, who can act when given a worthy screenplay, cannot be fully blamed here. For I doubt this material could have been handled well by any actor, young or old. Because I was not the least bit intimidated or frightened by him, I saw no reason why Miss Witherspoon, or her parents or friends, would be, either. However, the worst sin the movie commits is insincerity. It is tackling a very topical and relevant collection of subject matter: underage sex, early-age affection, the tough times between parents and children at that crucial age of sixteen. But instead of offering insight about these tough times--that everyone of us can relate to in one way or another--it just pushes those opportunities aside in favor of over-the-top exploitation. Take, for example, the denouement of the picture. Instead of going for a plausible conclusion, the movie goes into a cheesy monster-on-the-loose formula, which very well have been a parody of "Night of the Living Dead." This is the sort of film where four teenage boys have been granted special powers like second lives and super-human strength. They apparently also become master electricians and know more about architecture than the designer of a maximum security system. How do they acquire this vast array of skills? By doing drugs, raping high school girls, and playing lots of pool. I don't buy it. The movie is so unconsciously bad that it is always racing ahead of itself. Even a scene such as a jogger running through some woods (not chased by a bad guy, by the way) is accompanied by whooshing camera motions and a soundtrack so noisy that it would make the world's most obnoxious rock band ask for a little quiet time. I suppose if there was any good intentions from the makers of the movie, it would have been along the lines of Larry Clark's "Kids" released a year before. But whereas that film had a purpose, "Fear" just pretends to have a purpose.

    Over the years, I've developed quite an aversion to Mark Wahlberg for various reasons: the guy was the front-man for quite possibly the suckiest boy-band of the 90s; he speaks with an irritatingly soft voice; his hair is crap; he starred in the awful Four Brothers, dreadful Planet of the Apes and dreary The Yards; he got to have on-screen sex with Heather Graham and Julianne Moore in Boogie Nights, and in Fear, he gets to break-in a jailbaitalicious Reese Witherspoon and screw a slutty Alyssa Milano. Tell me, what's to like about the guy? Fortunately, in Fear, where Wahlberg plays despicable psycho David, who makes life absolute hell for pretty schoolgirl Nicole Walker (Witherspoon), her friends and family, a general disdain of the actor, compounded with a hatred for his character, makes this movie an all the more intense and enjoyable experience: after having Witherspoon and Milano lounge around in bikinis, Milano bending over in a very short skirt, step-milf Laura Walker (Amy Brenneman) in a sexy one-piece, Witherspoon orgasming (with a little help from David) while riding a roller-coaster, Gary's neck snapped like a twig, and The Walker's pet dog Kaiser's decapitated noggin pushed through its dog-flap during a tense siege/home invasion, what better way for director James Foley to end his film than by launching Wahlberg through a first storey window to land face-down on the rocks below?

    Mindless cheesy teenage fun. Marky mark's facial expressions make the whole thing worth it. Reese wanders about in a pretty convincing manner. The friends are contrived and fantastically cookie cutter 90's punks, so that was funny. My main complaint is plot holes. Ending is kind of silly. Successful father with fortress like house doesn't own a gun or a cell phone? If Dad had pulled a Glock it would've been the shortest conclusion in all of cinema. They also own the worst German shepard in history. I've been around these dogs. Sneaking around in the bushes with 7 other strange guys is a shortcut to a removed jugular.

    This movie is way too predictable to be able to be enjoyed. You can see everything coming a mile away. Isn't that the antithesis of what a suspense film should be? Shouldn't I be surprised when something happens? After all, isn't suspense just a feeling you get when you're not sure what's about to happen? If so, it would seem the word and the movie are a contradiction in terms. The acting is pretty stale as far as I'm concerned. Reese Witherspoon plays the pretty idiot. She doesn't really have that much to say in this movie, even though she's basically the main character. As far as Mark Wahlberg is concerned...Man, oh man, is he a terrible actor or what? I seriously don't see what other people like about him. I think this movie would've been better than it was had they been able to find a better actor to play Wahlberg's character. What was it I didn't like about Wahlberg's performance? Well, for starters...His "good guy" persona was way too transparent. You'd have to be a complete moron to not know this guy was a fake. The pickup lines he was feeding Reese were being put on so thick I about wanted to hurl...Why do girls buy this kind of crap? Meanwhile, his "bad guy" wasn't very intimidating as far as I'm concerned. If I would've been Reese's dad, I would've opened a can of a whoop-ass on Mr. Marky Mark here. Overall, this movie is a "by the numbers" suspense flick. Nothing new. No surprises. No suspense. I'd recommend passing it up. This is just a stupid movie and a big waste of time.

    This is probably one of my favorite movies. Why? Because men like this EXIST IN REAL LIFE. Being a residential counselor and seeing men behave this way - it is completely realistic. The psychological background completes Mark Wahlberg's character development. The upbringing and dialog corresponds to the promiscuous friend's behavior Played by Alyssa Milano. This is the most under-rated movie. Mark Wahlberg shines in this one. There is one particular scene in this movie that is still stuck in my head which rarely happens. The few lines from Mark Wahlberg are so poetically psychotic it leaves you thinking for hours (or even days) after the credits role - which is what a movie is supposed to do. A movie is supposed to send a message and expand your awareness. This is the most under-rated movie and a must watch. It's 2013 and this 1996 script still resonates a fresh tone in today's world.

    A straight forward girl meets boy, girl and boy split up and one get very mad picture. Fear is A surprisingly Dark Psychological thriller. With moments of sex and violence that were more graphic than what i was expecting. The cast showed early signs of the talents and stars they would become, Alyssa Milano for me giving the best performance in her small role in the movie. I enjoyed the father - daughter relationship which seemed realistic. The Direction of the film was on point and the action in the film keeps things moving along at a steady pace, and the tension building towards a reasonably satisfying climax. negatively, i did not enjoy the soundtrack, as individual songs i may have enjoyed them, but they did not build tension and seemed to not match the action taking place, moments in the story came off as silly especially a sexual assault confusingly being seen as a legitimate consensual sex act. Also as a whole i did enjoy the performances but never really found Mark Wahlberg's early sensitive side in the picture as true. On the whole i did enjoy the film, but still would have to give an average rating.

    Seventeen years ago this might have been classed as very good but by today's standards it's merely good. Almost all of the actors are well known, well certainly better known now than back then and their acting too has come a long way. Look at Mark Wahlberg, in my opinion he has proved himself over and over to the stage that he's up there with the best and is a very dedicated actor. From the likes of PT Anderson's wonderful 'Boogie Nights' to his comedic talents in 'Ted' I enjoy most of his work. I watched 'This Means War' just before this, with Reese Witherspoon and I really enjoyed her performance in it and while she was good in this she is a million times better in a comedy. She looks great too. The direction in this was exceedingly uninspired as was the cinematography and even the production, the general look and feel of this was a touch generic. It badly lacked style of which a heavy dose would have gone a long way but again, I might be seeing all the flaws that passing time allows us to focus on. If you haven't seen this and are a more casual film goer then you could do a lot worse. If, however you seen it years ago and your curious don't be, you'll just find it tedious and mind numbingly predictable. Score: 6.5/10 e-mail: 'Nav Q' - navq@ymail.com

    Referred to by its own producer, Brian Grazer, as a "Fatal Attraction" for teens, this slick thriller holds no surprises but is still reasonably good visceral entertainment. Reese Witherspoon plays Nicole, a Typical Teen with an Overprotective Dad, Steve (William Petersen). Nicole chances to meet a hunky stranger named David (Mark Wahlberg, in one of his earliest starring gigs) and they enter into a passionate relationship, only for Nicole to realize that every suspicion that her dad has about her boyfriend is correct: the guy's a brutal, controlling thug. And he naturally doesn't take kindly to being dumped. Simply put, this is the kind of cretin who simply won't be denied what he wants. And he'll kill anybody to get it.

I seriously don't see what other people like about him. I think this movie would've been better than it was had they been able to find a better actor to play Wahlberg's character. What was it I didn't like about Wahlberg's performance? Well, for starters...His "good guy" persona was way too transparent. You'd have to be a complete moron to not know this guy was a fake. The pickup lines he was feeding Reese were being put on so thick I about wanted to hurl...Why do girls buy this kind of crap? Meanwhile, his "bad guy" wasn't very intimidating as far as I'm concerned. If I would've been Reese's dad, I would've opened a can of a whoop-ass on Mr. Marky Mark here. Overall, this movie is a "by the numbers" suspense flick. Nothing new. No surprises. No suspense. I'd recommend passing it up. This is just a stupid movie and a big waste of time.

    This is probably one of my favorite movies. Why? Because men like this EXIST IN REAL LIFE. Being a residential counselor and seeing men behave this way - it is completely realistic. The psychological background completes Mark Wahlberg's character development. The upbringing and dialog corresponds to the promiscuous friend's behavior Played by Alyssa Milano. This is the most under-rated movie. Mark Wahlberg shines in this one. There is one particular scene in this movie that is still stuck in my head which rarely happens. The few lines from Mark Wahlberg are so poetically psychotic it leaves you thinking for hours (or even days) after the credits role - which is what a movie is supposed to do. A movie is supposed to send a message and expand your awareness. This is the most under-rated movie and a must watch. It's 2013 and this 1996 script still resonates a fresh tone in today's world.

    A straight forward girl meets boy, girl and boy split up and one get very mad picture. Fear is A surprisingly Dark Psychological thriller. With moments of sex and violence that were more graphic than what i was expecting. The cast showed early signs of the talents and stars they would become, Alyssa Milano for me giving the best performance in her small role in the movie. I enjoyed the father - daughter relationship which seemed realistic. The Direction of the film was on point and the action in the film keeps things moving along at a steady pace, and the tension building towards a reasonably satisfying climax. negatively, i did not enjoy the soundtrack, as individual songs i may have enjoyed them, but they did not build tension and seemed to not match the action taking place, moments in the story came off as silly especially a sexual assault confusingly being seen as a legitimate consensual sex act. Also as a whole i did enjoy the performances but never really found Mark Wahlberg's early sensitive side in the picture as true. On the whole i did enjoy the film, but still would have to give an average rating.

    Seventeen years ago this might have been classed as very good but by today's standards it's merely good. Almost all of the actors are well known, well certainly better known now than back then and their acting too has come a long way. Look at Mark Wahlberg, in my opinion he has proved himself over and over to the stage that he's up there with the best and is a very dedicated actor. From the likes of PT Anderson's wonderful 'Boogie Nights' to his comedic talents in 'Ted' I enjoy most of his work. I watched 'This Means War' just before this, with Reese Witherspoon and I really enjoyed her performance in it and while she was good in this she is a million times better in a comedy. She looks great too. The direction in this was exceedingly uninspired as was the cinematography and even the production, the general look and feel of this was a touch generic. It badly lacked style of which a heavy dose would have gone a long way but again, I might be seeing all the flaws that passing time allows us to focus on. If you haven't seen this and are a more casual film goer then you could do a lot worse. If, however you seen it years ago and your curious don't be, you'll just find it tedious and mind numbingly predictable. Score: 6.5/10 e-mail: 'Nav Q' - navq@ymail.com

    Referred to by its own producer, Brian Grazer, as a "Fatal Attraction" for teens, this slick thriller holds no surprises but is still reasonably good visceral entertainment. Reese Witherspoon plays Nicole, a Typical Teen with an Overprotective Dad, Steve (William Petersen). Nicole chances to meet a hunky stranger named David (Mark Wahlberg, in one of his earliest starring gigs) and they enter into a passionate relationship, only for Nicole to realize that every suspicion that her dad has about her boyfriend is correct: the guy's a brutal, controlling thug. And he naturally doesn't take kindly to being dumped. Simply put, this is the kind of cretin who simply won't be denied what he wants. And he'll kill anybody to get it. "Fear" does benefit from very capable direction by James Foley ("Glengarry Glen Ross"), and impressive widescreen photography. This story does move along quite well without getting bogged down in any sort of filler. It's also quite sexy, to boot: Nicole and David have some steamy couplings along the way. The action gravitates right toward the kind of final showdown that we know from the start is going to be inevitable. As it happens, Steve foolishly gives Davids' equally seedy goon friends all the motivation they need to launch an assault on the family home. The movie is certainly well cast and all of the performances are effective. Also among the actors are Alyssa Milano as Witherspoons' friend and Amy Brenneman as the dads' new lady friend. Witherspoon is appealing and Wahlberg is convincing as the lovestruck antagonist. Overall this works pretty well at manipulating its audience and getting them all cranked up. The big finale is reasonably exciting and has some brutal moments. While this might not be innovative stuff in any way, it does do its job, and delivers the expected thrills. Seven out of 10.

    "Fear" is a slightly-above average thriller at best, boasting fine performances from Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon and William Petersen. Nicole Walker is sixteen years-old and living with her businessman father and step-mother and brother in a luxurious, well fortified and secure pad. When reluctantly skipping school one day with her rebellious friends, she spots the hunk David McCall (Mark Wahlberg) - wearing a tight black sweater to accentuate them pecs, of course, playing pool with his misfit, drug-addled pals. She later meets him at a rave, and before long, they are dating. David is perfect, it seems. He's strong, caring, sweet and gentle, and Nicole falls in love with him. But it isn't long before David's true colours start to show. And when she ends it with him, he begins to stalk her before eventually, he gets nasty... "Fear" runs smoothly at a nice pace over a very agreeable run-time. Mark Wahlberg is superb as a psychopath, while Reese Witherspoon is believable as a naive and innocent sixteen year-old girl (Considering she was 20 at the time). William Petersen, best known for his career with "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", is commendable as he gives Dustin Hoffman's heroics in "Straw Dogs" a run for it's money at the end. Overall, this is a decent thriller, albeit nothing special really. It's pretty tense in parts, but Wahlberg's performance was really key to this films success.

    There's a lot about "Fear" that's pretty clich&eacute;. The charming boyfriend who turns out to be a controlling, violent, psychopathic, obsessive guy who can't let go of the girl he's "fallen in love" with in spite of the fact that neither she nor her family want him around anymore. I can't say that struck me as particularly creative, nor did I find the bulk of the story especially interesting. It does, however, have some things going for it. First, I have to give credit to Drew Barrymore and Mark Wahlberg. Setting aside the fact that both were a little older than the characters they were playing, they were quite good in their roles as the young & naive Nicole and the charming psychopath David who sweeps her off her feet. Both were in the very early stages of their respective acting careers, but the lack of experience didn't show. They were convincing. The rest of the cast didn't really measure up to their standards, but the characters were interesting enough. I could certainly relate to William Petersen as Nicole's dad as he gets more and more concerned about this relationship his daughter is having, even though for some reason Petersen didn't really strike home with me in the role. And I have to say that although the movie almost lost me with the silly scene where David tattoos "Nicole 4 Eva" on his own chest, and while most of the story really didn't make that much of a connection with me, the last 20 minutes or so turns out to be a pretty good ride. It also is pretty standard for this kind of movie - as Nicole's entire family ends up doing battle with David and the bad guys, etc., etc., but it was very well done and exciting. This isn't a bad movie. It's perhaps a bit too much driven by clich&eacute;s and a storyline that isn't very original, but it's well made and it has enough to keep the viewer interested. (6/10)

    In 1996, James Foley directed a movie called "Fear." If there is any irony to be found in that title, it may very well be in that Mr. Foley would have had reason to be concerned about his career after making this mindless, overproduced piece of garbage. Five years earlier, now-famous Reese Witherspoon made her debut in a wonderful movie called "The Man in the Moon." In both that film and this one, she played a teenager troubled by her crush on a boy. Except in that much-superior film, it was because her crush was three years older than her and he was smitten by her sister. In this film, it's because he's a sex-addicted psychopath who won't leave her be. "Fear" could be described as an adolescent version of "Fatal Attraction." But there is a difference. Up until its last ten minutes, "Fatal Attraction" was a splendid thriller as well as an insightful one. It had a sharp, shrewd knowledge about marital affairs. Hence why Glenn Close still claims to this day that her performance stopped several men from cheating on their wives. That movie did lose its mind in its big climactic ending, but "Fear" is a movie born without a mind. And if you thought the ending to "Fatal Attraction" was ludicrous, wait until you get a load of what happens here. One of the core faults of the picture is lack of a demanding villain. I've had mixed feelings about Mark Wahlberg before, but this could be his worst performance. As the stalking boyfriend with a household of hoods, he's about as frightening as the stone lions in front of a library. There are two sides to Mr. Wahlberg's performance, one worse than the other. When his character goes psychotic at the end, it's just limp ham-acting. But he's worse at the beginning, when he's pretending to be a nice guy just by speaking softly and hanging his eyelids as if he had insomnia. But I guess Mr. Wahlberg, who can act when given a worthy screenplay, cannot be fully blamed here. For I doubt this material could have been handled well by any actor, young or old. Because I was not the least bit intimidated or frightened by him, I saw no reason why Miss Witherspoon, or her parents or friends, would be, either. However, the worst sin the movie commits is insincerity. It is tackling a very topical and relevant collection of subject matter: underage sex, early-age affection, the tough times between parents and children at that crucial age of sixteen. But instead of offering insight about these tough times--that everyone of us can relate to in one way or another--it just pushes those opportunities aside in favor of over-the-top exploitation. Take, for example, the denouement of the picture. Instead of going for a plausible conclusion, the movie goes into a cheesy monster-on-the-loose formula, which very well have been a parody of "Night of the Living Dead." This is the sort of film where four teenage boys have been granted special powers like second lives and super-human strength. They apparently also become master electricians and know more about architecture than the designer of a maximum security system. How do they acquire this vast array of skills? By doing drugs, raping high school girls, and playing lots of pool. I don't buy it. The movie is so unconsciously bad that it is always racing ahead of itself. Even a scene such as a jogger running through some woods (not chased by a bad guy, by the way) is accompanied by whooshing camera motions and a soundtrack so noisy that it would make the world's most obnoxious rock band ask for a little quiet time. I suppose if there was any good intentions from the makers of the movie, it would have been along the lines of Larry Clark's "Kids" released a year before. But whereas that film had a purpose, "Fear" just pretends to have a purpose.

    Over the years, I've developed quite an aversion to Mark Wahlberg for various reasons: the guy was the front-man for quite possibly the suckiest boy-band of the 90s; he speaks with an irritatingly soft voice; his hair is crap; he starred in the awful Four Brothers, dreadful Planet of the Apes and dreary The Yards; he got to have on-screen sex with Heather Graham and Julianne Moore in Boogie Nights, and in Fear, he gets to break-in a jailbaitalicious Reese Witherspoon and screw a slutty Alyssa Milano. Tell me, what's to like about the guy? Fortunately, in Fear, where Wahlberg plays despicable psycho David, who makes life absolute hell for pretty schoolgirl Nicole Walker (Witherspoon), her friends and family, a general disdain of the actor, compounded with a hatred for his character, makes this movie an all the more intense and enjoyable experience: after having Witherspoon and Milano lounge around in bikinis, Milano bending over in a very short skirt, step-milf Laura Walker (Amy Brenneman) in a sexy one-piece, Witherspoon orgasming (with a little help from David) while riding a roller-coaster, Gary's neck snapped like a twig, and The Walker's pet dog Kaiser's decapitated noggin pushed through its dog-flap during a tense siege/home invasion, what better way for director James Foley to end his film than by launching Wahlberg through a first storey window to land face-down on the rocks below?

    Mindless cheesy teenage fun. Marky mark's facial expressions make the whole thing worth it. Reese wanders about in a pretty convincing manner. The friends are contrived and fantastically cookie cutter 90's punks, so that was funny. My main complaint is plot holes. Ending is kind of silly. Successful father with fortress like house doesn't own a gun or a cell phone? If Dad had pulled a Glock it would've been the shortest conclusion in all of cinema. They also own the worst German shepard in history. I've been around these dogs. Sneaking around in the bushes with 7 other strange guys is a shortcut to a removed jugular.

    This movie is way too predictable to be able to be enjoyed. You can see everything coming a mile away. Isn't that the antithesis of what a suspense film should be? Shouldn't I be surprised when something happens? After all, isn't suspense just a feeling you get when you're not sure what's about to happen? If so, it would seem the word and the movie are a contradiction in terms. The acting is pretty stale as far as I'm concerned. Reese Witherspoon plays the pretty idiot. She doesn't really have that much to say in this movie, even though she's basically the main character. As far as Mark Wahlberg is concerned...Man, oh man, is he a terrible actor or what? I seriously don't see what other people like about him. I think this movie would've been better than it was had they been able to find a better actor to play Wahlberg's character. What was it I didn't like about Wahlberg's performance? Well, for starters...His "good guy" persona was way too transparent. You'd have to be a complete moron to not know this guy was a fake. The pickup lines he was feeding Reese were being put on so thick I about wanted to hurl...Why do girls buy this kind of crap? Meanwhile, his "bad guy" wasn't very intimidating as far as I'm concerned. If I would've been Reese's dad, I would've opened a can of a whoop-ass on Mr. Marky Mark here. Overall, this movie is a "by the numbers" suspense flick. Nothing new. No surprises. No suspense. I'd recommend passing it up. This is just a stupid movie and a big waste of time.

As the stalking boyfriend with a household of hoods, he's about as frightening as the stone lions in front of a library. There are two sides to Mr. Wahlberg's performance, one worse than the other. When his character goes psychotic at the end, it's just limp ham-acting. But he's worse at the beginning, when he's pretending to be a nice guy just by speaking softly and hanging his eyelids as if he had insomnia. But I guess Mr. Wahlberg, who can act when given a worthy screenplay, cannot be fully blamed here. For I doubt this material could have been handled well by any actor, young or old. Because I was not the least bit intimidated or frightened by him, I saw no reason why Miss Witherspoon, or her parents or friends, would be, either. However, the worst sin the movie commits is insincerity. It is tackling a very topical and relevant collection of subject matter: underage sex, early-age affection, the tough times between parents and children at that crucial age of sixteen. But instead of offering insight about these tough times--that everyone of us can relate to in one way or another--it just pushes those opportunities aside in favor of over-the-top exploitation. Take, for example, the denouement of the picture. Instead of going for a plausible conclusion, the movie goes into a cheesy monster-on-the-loose formula, which very well have been a parody of "Night of the Living Dead." This is the sort of film where four teenage boys have been granted special powers like second lives and super-human strength. They apparently also become master electricians and know more about architecture than the designer of a maximum security system. How do they acquire this vast array of skills? By doing drugs, raping high school girls, and playing lots of pool. I don't buy it. The movie is so unconsciously bad that it is always racing ahead of itself. Even a scene such as a jogger running through some woods (not chased by a bad guy, by the way) is accompanied by whooshing camera motions and a soundtrack so noisy that it would make the world's most obnoxious rock band ask for a little quiet time. I suppose if there was any good intentions from the makers of the movie, it would have been along the lines of Larry Clark's "Kids" released a year before. But whereas that film had a purpose, "Fear" just pretends to have a purpose.

    Over the years, I've developed quite an aversion to Mark Wahlberg for various reasons: the guy was the front-man for quite possibly the suckiest boy-band of the 90s; he speaks with an irritatingly soft voice; his hair is crap; he starred in the awful Four Brothers, dreadful Planet of the Apes and dreary The Yards; he got to have on-screen sex with Heather Graham and Julianne Moore in Boogie Nights, and in Fear, he gets to break-in a jailbaitalicious Reese Witherspoon and screw a slutty Alyssa Milano. Tell me, what's to like about the guy? Fortunately, in Fear, where Wahlberg plays despicable psycho David, who makes life absolute hell for pretty schoolgirl Nicole Walker (Witherspoon), her friends and family, a general disdain of the actor, compounded with a hatred for his character, makes this movie an all the more intense and enjoyable experience: after having Witherspoon and Milano lounge around in bikinis, Milano bending over in a very short skirt, step-milf Laura Walker (Amy Brenneman) in a sexy one-piece, Witherspoon orgasming (with a little help from David) while riding a roller-coaster, Gary's neck snapped like a twig, and The Walker's pet dog Kaiser's decapitated noggin pushed through its dog-flap during a tense siege/home invasion, what better way for director James Foley to end his film than by launching Wahlberg through a first storey window to land face-down on the rocks below?

    Mindless cheesy teenage fun. Marky mark's facial expressions make the whole thing worth it. Reese wanders about in a pretty convincing manner. The friends are contrived and fantastically cookie cutter 90's punks, so that was funny. My main complaint is plot holes. Ending is kind of silly. Successful father with fortress like house doesn't own a gun or a cell phone? If Dad had pulled a Glock it would've been the shortest conclusion in all of cinema. They also own the worst German shepard in history. I've been around these dogs. Sneaking around in the bushes with 7 other strange guys is a shortcut to a removed jugular.

    This movie is way too predictable to be able to be enjoyed. You can see everything coming a mile away. Isn't that the antithesis of what a suspense film should be? Shouldn't I be surprised when something happens? After all, isn't suspense just a feeling you get when you're not sure what's about to happen? If so, it would seem the word and the movie are a contradiction in terms. The acting is pretty stale as far as I'm concerned. Reese Witherspoon plays the pretty idiot. She doesn't really have that much to say in this movie, even though she's basically the main character. As far as Mark Wahlberg is concerned...Man, oh man, is he a terrible actor or what? I seriously don't see what other people like about him. I think this movie would've been better than it was had they been able to find a better actor to play Wahlberg's character. What was it I didn't like about Wahlberg's performance? Well, for starters...His "good guy" persona was way too transparent. You'd have to be a complete moron to not know this guy was a fake. The pickup lines he was feeding Reese were being put on so thick I about wanted to hurl...Why do girls buy this kind of crap? Meanwhile, his "bad guy" wasn't very intimidating as far as I'm concerned. If I would've been Reese's dad, I would've opened a can of a whoop-ass on Mr. Marky Mark here. Overall, this movie is a "by the numbers" suspense flick. Nothing new. No surprises. No suspense. I'd recommend passing it up. This is just a stupid movie and a big waste of time.

    This is probably one of my favorite movies. Why? Because men like this EXIST IN REAL LIFE. Being a residential counselor and seeing men behave this way - it is completely realistic. The psychological background completes Mark Wahlberg's character development. The upbringing and dialog corresponds to the promiscuous friend's behavior Played by Alyssa Milano. This is the most under-rated movie. Mark Wahlberg shines in this one. There is one particular scene in this movie that is still stuck in my head which rarely happens. The few lines from Mark Wahlberg are so poetically psychotic it leaves you thinking for hours (or even days) after the credits role - which is what a movie is supposed to do. A movie is supposed to send a message and expand your awareness. This is the most under-rated movie and a must watch. It's 2013 and this 1996 script still resonates a fresh tone in today's world.

    A straight forward girl meets boy, girl and boy split up and one get very mad picture. Fear is A surprisingly Dark Psychological thriller. With moments of sex and violence that were more graphic than what i was expecting. The cast showed early signs of the talents and stars they would become, Alyssa Milano for me giving the best performance in her small role in the movie. I enjoyed the father - daughter relationship which seemed realistic. The Direction of the film was on point and the action in the film keeps things moving along at a steady pace, and the tension building towards a reasonably satisfying climax. negatively, i did not enjoy the soundtrack, as individual songs i may have enjoyed them, but they did not build tension and seemed to not match the action taking place, moments in the story came off as silly especially a sexual assault confusingly being seen as a legitimate consensual sex act. Also as a whole i did enjoy the performances but never really found Mark Wahlberg's early sensitive side in the picture as true. On the whole i did enjoy the film, but still would have to give an average rating.

    Seventeen years ago this might have been classed as very good but by today's standards it's merely good. Almost all of the actors are well known, well certainly better known now than back then and their acting too has come a long way. Look at Mark Wahlberg, in my opinion he has proved himself over and over to the stage that he's up there with the best and is a very dedicated actor. From the likes of PT Anderson's wonderful 'Boogie Nights' to his comedic talents in 'Ted' I enjoy most of his work. I watched 'This Means War' just before this, with Reese Witherspoon and I really enjoyed her performance in it and while she was good in this she is a million times better in a comedy. She looks great too. The direction in this was exceedingly uninspired as was the cinematography and even the production, the general look and feel of this was a touch generic. It badly lacked style of which a heavy dose would have gone a long way but again, I might be seeing all the flaws that passing time allows us to focus on. If you haven't seen this and are a more casual film goer then you could do a lot worse. If, however you seen it years ago and your curious don't be, you'll just find it tedious and mind numbingly predictable. Score: 6.5/10 e-mail: 'Nav Q' - navq@ymail.com

    Referred to by its own producer, Brian Grazer, as a "Fatal Attraction" for teens, this slick thriller holds no surprises but is still reasonably good visceral entertainment. Reese Witherspoon plays Nicole, a Typical Teen with an Overprotective Dad, Steve (William Petersen). Nicole chances to meet a hunky stranger named David (Mark Wahlberg, in one of his earliest starring gigs) and they enter into a passionate relationship, only for Nicole to realize that every suspicion that her dad has about her boyfriend is correct: the guy's a brutal, controlling thug. And he naturally doesn't take kindly to being dumped. Simply put, this is the kind of cretin who simply won't be denied what he wants. And he'll kill anybody to get it. "Fear" does benefit from very capable direction by James Foley ("Glengarry Glen Ross"), and impressive widescreen photography. This story does move along quite well without getting bogged down in any sort of filler. It's also quite sexy, to boot: Nicole and David have some steamy couplings along the way. The action gravitates right toward the kind of final showdown that we know from the start is going to be inevitable. As it happens, Steve foolishly gives Davids' equally seedy goon friends all the motivation they need to launch an assault on the family home. The movie is certainly well cast and all of the performances are effective. Also among the actors are Alyssa Milano as Witherspoons' friend and Amy Brenneman as the dads' new lady friend. Witherspoon is appealing and Wahlberg is convincing as the lovestruck antagonist. Overall this works pretty well at manipulating its audience and getting them all cranked up. The big finale is reasonably exciting and has some brutal moments. While this might not be innovative stuff in any way, it does do its job, and delivers the expected thrills. Seven out of 10.

    "Fear" is a slightly-above average thriller at best, boasting fine performances from Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon and William Petersen. Nicole Walker is sixteen years-old and living with her businessman father and step-mother and brother in a luxurious, well fortified and secure pad. When reluctantly skipping school one day with her rebellious friends, she spots the hunk David McCall (Mark Wahlberg) - wearing a tight black sweater to accentuate them pecs, of course, playing pool with his misfit, drug-addled pals. She later meets him at a rave, and before long, they are dating. David is perfect, it seems. He's strong, caring, sweet and gentle, and Nicole falls in love with him. But it isn't long before David's true colours start to show. And when she ends it with him, he begins to stalk her before eventually, he gets nasty... "Fear" runs smoothly at a nice pace over a very agreeable run-time. Mark Wahlberg is superb as a psychopath, while Reese Witherspoon is believable as a naive and innocent sixteen year-old girl (Considering she was 20 at the time). William Petersen, best known for his career with "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", is commendable as he gives Dustin Hoffman's heroics in "Straw Dogs" a run for it's money at the end. Overall, this is a decent thriller, albeit nothing special really. It's pretty tense in parts, but Wahlberg's performance was really key to this films success.

    There's a lot about "Fear" that's pretty clich&eacute;. The charming boyfriend who turns out to be a controlling, violent, psychopathic, obsessive guy who can't let go of the girl he's "fallen in love" with in spite of the fact that neither she nor her family want him around anymore. I can't say that struck me as particularly creative, nor did I find the bulk of the story especially interesting. It does, however, have some things going for it. First, I have to give credit to Drew Barrymore and Mark Wahlberg. Setting aside the fact that both were a little older than the characters they were playing, they were quite good in their roles as the young & naive Nicole and the charming psychopath David who sweeps her off her feet. Both were in the very early stages of their respective acting careers, but the lack of experience didn't show. They were convincing. The rest of the cast didn't really measure up to their standards, but the characters were interesting enough. I could certainly relate to William Petersen as Nicole's dad as he gets more and more concerned about this relationship his daughter is having, even though for some reason Petersen didn't really strike home with me in the role. And I have to say that although the movie almost lost me with the silly scene where David tattoos "Nicole 4 Eva" on his own chest, and while most of the story really didn't make that much of a connection with me, the last 20 minutes or so turns out to be a pretty good ride. It also is pretty standard for this kind of movie - as Nicole's entire family ends up doing battle with David and the bad guys, etc., etc., but it was very well done and exciting. This isn't a bad movie. It's perhaps a bit too much driven by clich&eacute;s and a storyline that isn't very original, but it's well made and it has enough to keep the viewer interested. (6/10)

    In 1996, James Foley directed a movie called "Fear." If there is any irony to be found in that title, it may very well be in that Mr. Foley would have had reason to be concerned about his career after making this mindless, overproduced piece of garbage. Five years earlier, now-famous Reese Witherspoon made her debut in a wonderful movie called "The Man in the Moon." In both that film and this one, she played a teenager troubled by her crush on a boy. Except in that much-superior film, it was because her crush was three years older than her and he was smitten by her sister. In this film, it's because he's a sex-addicted psychopath who won't leave her be. "Fear" could be described as an adolescent version of "Fatal Attraction." But there is a difference. Up until its last ten minutes, "Fatal Attraction" was a splendid thriller as well as an insightful one. It had a sharp, shrewd knowledge about marital affairs. Hence why Glenn Close still claims to this day that her performance stopped several men from cheating on their wives. That movie did lose its mind in its big climactic ending, but "Fear" is a movie born without a mind. And if you thought the ending to "Fatal Attraction" was ludicrous, wait until you get a load of what happens here. One of the core faults of the picture is lack of a demanding villain. I've had mixed feelings about Mark Wahlberg before, but this could be his worst performance. As the stalking boyfriend with a household of hoods, he's about as frightening as the stone lions in front of a library. There are two sides to Mr. Wahlberg's performance, one worse than the other. When his character goes psychotic at the end, it's just limp ham-acting. But he's worse at the beginning, when he's pretending to be a nice guy just by speaking softly and hanging his eyelids as if he had insomnia.

The big finale is reasonably exciting and has some brutal moments. While this might not be innovative stuff in any way, it does do its job, and delivers the expected thrills. Seven out of 10.

    "Fear" is a slightly-above average thriller at best, boasting fine performances from Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon and William Petersen. Nicole Walker is sixteen years-old and living with her businessman father and step-mother and brother in a luxurious, well fortified and secure pad. When reluctantly skipping school one day with her rebellious friends, she spots the hunk David McCall (Mark Wahlberg) - wearing a tight black sweater to accentuate them pecs, of course, playing pool with his misfit, drug-addled pals. She later meets him at a rave, and before long, they are dating. David is perfect, it seems. He's strong, caring, sweet and gentle, and Nicole falls in love with him. But it isn't long before David's true colours start to show. And when she ends it with him, he begins to stalk her before eventually, he gets nasty... "Fear" runs smoothly at a nice pace over a very agreeable run-time. Mark Wahlberg is superb as a psychopath, while Reese Witherspoon is believable as a naive and innocent sixteen year-old girl (Considering she was 20 at the time). William Petersen, best known for his career with "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation", is commendable as he gives Dustin Hoffman's heroics in "Straw Dogs" a run for it's money at the end. Overall, this is a decent thriller, albeit nothing special really. It's pretty tense in parts, but Wahlberg's performance was really key to this films success.

    There's a lot about "Fear" that's pretty clich&eacute;. The charming boyfriend who turns out to be a controlling, violent, psychopathic, obsessive guy who can't let go of the girl he's "fallen in love" with in spite of the fact that neither she nor her family want him around anymore. I can't say that struck me as particularly creative, nor did I find the bulk of the story especially interesting. It does, however, have some things going for it. First, I have to give credit to Drew Barrymore and Mark Wahlberg. Setting aside the fact that both were a little older than the characters they were playing, they were quite good in their roles as the young & naive Nicole and the charming psychopath David who sweeps her off her feet. Both were in the very early stages of their respective acting careers, but the lack of experience didn't show. They were convincing. The rest of the cast didn't really measure up to their standards, but the characters were interesting enough. I could certainly relate to William Petersen as Nicole's dad as he gets more and more concerned about this relationship his daughter is having, even though for some reason Petersen didn't really strike home with me in the role. And I have to say that although the movie almost lost me with the silly scene where David tattoos "Nicole 4 Eva" on his own chest, and while most of the story really didn't make that much of a connection with me, the last 20 minutes or so turns out to be a pretty good ride. It also is pretty standard for this kind of movie - as Nicole's entire family ends up doing battle with David and the bad guys, etc., etc., but it was very well done and exciting. This isn't a bad movie. It's perhaps a bit too much driven by clich&eacute;s and a storyline that isn't very original, but it's well made and it has enough to keep the viewer interested. (6/10)

    In 1996, James Foley directed a movie called "Fear." If there is any irony to be found in that title, it may very well be in that Mr. Foley would have had reason to be concerned about his career after making this mindless, overproduced piece of garbage. Five years earlier, now-famous Reese Witherspoon made her debut in a wonderful movie called "The Man in the Moon." In both that film and this one, she played a teenager troubled by her crush on a boy. Except in that much-superior film, it was because her crush was three years older than her and he was smitten by her sister. In this film, it's because he's a sex-addicted psychopath who won't leave her be. "Fear" could be described as an adolescent version of "Fatal Attraction." But there is a difference. Up until its last ten minutes, "Fatal Attraction" was a splendid thriller as well as an insightful one. It had a sharp, shrewd knowledge about marital affairs. Hence why Glenn Close still claims to this day that her performance stopped several men from cheating on their wives. That movie did lose its mind in its big climactic ending, but "Fear" is a movie born without a mind. And if you thought the ending to "Fatal Attraction" was ludicrous, wait until you get a load of what happens here. One of the core faults of the picture is lack of a demanding villain. I've had mixed feelings about Mark Wahlberg before, but this could be his worst performance. As the stalking boyfriend with a household of hoods, he's about as frightening as the stone lions in front of a library. There are two sides to Mr. Wahlberg's performance, one worse than the other. When his character goes psychotic at the end, it's just limp ham-acting. But he's worse at the beginning, when he's pretending to be a nice guy just by speaking softly and hanging his eyelids as if he had insomnia. But I guess Mr. Wahlberg, who can act when given a worthy screenplay, cannot be fully blamed here. For I doubt this material could have been handled well by any actor, young or old. Because I was not the least bit intimidated or frightened by him, I saw no reason why Miss Witherspoon, or her parents or friends, would be, either. However, the worst sin the movie commits is insincerity. It is tackling a very topical and relevant collection of subject matter: underage sex, early-age affection, the tough times between parents and children at that crucial age of sixteen. But instead of offering insight about these tough times--that everyone of us can relate to in one way or another--it just pushes those opportunities aside in favor of over-the-top exploitation. Take, for example, the denouement of the picture. Instead of going for a plausible conclusion, the movie goes into a cheesy monster-on-the-loose formula, which very well have been a parody of "Night of the Living Dead." This is the sort of film where four teenage boys have been granted special powers like second lives and super-human strength. They apparently also become master electricians and know more about architecture than the designer of a maximum security system. How do they acquire this vast array of skills? By doing drugs, raping high school girls, and playing lots of pool. I don't buy it. The movie is so unconsciously bad that it is always racing ahead of itself. Even a scene such as a jogger running through some woods (not chased by a bad guy, by the way) is accompanied by whooshing camera motions and a soundtrack so noisy that it would make the world's most obnoxious rock band ask for a little quiet time. I suppose if there was any good intentions from the makers of the movie, it would have been along the lines of Larry Clark's "Kids" released a year before. But whereas that film had a purpose, "Fear" just pretends to have a purpose.

    Over the years, I've developed quite an aversion to Mark Wahlberg for various reasons: the guy was the front-man for quite possibly the suckiest boy-band of the 90s; he speaks with an irritatingly soft voice; his hair is crap; he starred in the awful Four Brothers, dreadful Planet of the Apes and dreary The Yards; he got to have on-screen sex with Heather Graham and Julianne Moore in Boogie Nights, and in Fear, he gets to break-in a jailbaitalicious Reese Witherspoon and screw a slutty Alyssa Milano. Tell me, what's to like about the guy? Fortunately, in Fear, where Wahlberg plays despicable psycho David, who makes life absolute hell for pretty schoolgirl Nicole Walker (Witherspoon), her friends and family, a general disdain of the actor, compounded with a hatred for his character, makes this movie an all the more intense and enjoyable experience: after having Witherspoon and Milano lounge around in bikinis, Milano bending over in a very short skirt, step-milf Laura Walker (Amy Brenneman) in a sexy one-piece, Witherspoon orgasming (with a little help from David) while riding a roller-coaster, Gary's neck snapped like a twig, and The Walker's pet dog Kaiser's decapitated noggin pushed through its dog-flap during a tense siege/home invasion, what better way for director James Foley to end his film than by launching Wahlberg through a first storey window to land face-down on the rocks below?

    Mindless cheesy teenage fun. Marky mark's facial expressions make the whole thing worth it. Reese wanders about in a pretty convincing manner. The friends are contrived and fantastically cookie cutter 90's punks, so that was funny. My main complaint is plot holes. Ending is kind of silly. Successful father with fortress like house doesn't own a gun or a cell phone? If Dad had pulled a Glock it would've been the shortest conclusion in all of cinema. They also own the worst German shepard in history. I've been around these dogs. Sneaking around in the bushes with 7 other strange guys is a shortcut to a removed jugular.

    This movie is way too predictable to be able to be enjoyed. You can see everything coming a mile away. Isn't that the antithesis of what a suspense film should be? Shouldn't I be surprised when something happens? After all, isn't suspense just a feeling you get when you're not sure what's about to happen? If so, it would seem the word and the movie are a contradiction in terms. The acting is pretty stale as far as I'm concerned. Reese Witherspoon plays the pretty idiot. She doesn't really have that much to say in this movie, even though she's basically the main character. As far as Mark Wahlberg is concerned...Man, oh man, is he a terrible actor or what? I seriously don't see what other people like about him. I think this movie would've been better than it was had they been able to find a better actor to play Wahlberg's character. What was it I didn't like about Wahlberg's performance? Well, for starters...His "good guy" persona was way too transparent. You'd have to be a complete moron to not know this guy was a fake. The pickup lines he was feeding Reese were being put on so thick I about wanted to hurl...Why do girls buy this kind of crap? Meanwhile, his "bad guy" wasn't very intimidating as far as I'm concerned. If I would've been Reese's dad, I would've opened a can of a whoop-ass on Mr. Marky Mark here. Overall, this movie is a "by the numbers" suspense flick. Nothing new. No surprises. No suspense. I'd recommend passing it up. This is just a stupid movie and a big waste of time.

    This is probably one of my favorite movies. Why? Because men like this EXIST IN REAL LIFE. Being a residential counselor and seeing men behave this way - it is completely realistic. The psychological background completes Mark Wahlberg's character development. The upbringing and dialog corresponds to the promiscuous friend's behavior Played by Alyssa Milano. This is the most under-rated movie. Mark Wahlberg shines in this one. There is one particular scene in this movie that is still stuck in my head which rarely happens. The few lines from Mark Wahlberg are so poetically psychotic it leaves you thinking for hours (or even days) after the credits role - which is what a movie is supposed to do. A movie is supposed to send a message and expand your awareness. This is the most under-rated movie and a must watch. It's 2013 and this 1996 script still resonates a fresh tone in today's world.

    A straight forward girl meets boy, girl and boy split up and one get very mad picture. Fear is A surprisingly Dark Psychological thriller. With moments of sex and violence that were more graphic than what i was expecting. The cast showed early signs of the talents and stars they would become, Alyssa Milano for me giving the best performance in her small role in the movie. I enjoyed the father - daughter relationship which seemed realistic. The Direction of the film was on point and the action in the film keeps things moving along at a steady pace, and the tension building towards a reasonably satisfying climax. negatively, i did not enjoy the soundtrack, as individual songs i may have enjoyed them, but they did not build tension and seemed to not match the action taking place, moments in the story came off as silly especially a sexual assault confusingly being seen as a legitimate consensual sex act. Also as a whole i did enjoy the performances but never really found Mark Wahlberg's early sensitive side in the picture as true. On the whole i did enjoy the film, but still would have to give an average rating.

    Seventeen years ago this might have been classed as very good but by today's standards it's merely good. Almost all of the actors are well known, well certainly better known now than back then and their acting too has come a long way. Look at Mark Wahlberg, in my opinion he has proved himself over and over to the stage that he's up there with the best and is a very dedicated actor. From the likes of PT Anderson's wonderful 'Boogie Nights' to his comedic talents in 'Ted' I enjoy most of his work. I watched 'This Means War' just before this, with Reese Witherspoon and I really enjoyed her performance in it and while she was good in this she is a million times better in a comedy. She looks great too. The direction in this was exceedingly uninspired as was the cinematography and even the production, the general look and feel of this was a touch generic. It badly lacked style of which a heavy dose would have gone a long way but again, I might be seeing all the flaws that passing time allows us to focus on. If you haven't seen this and are a more casual film goer then you could do a lot worse. If, however you seen it years ago and your curious don't be, you'll just find it tedious and mind numbingly predictable. Score: 6.5/10 e-mail: 'Nav Q' - navq@ymail.com

    Referred to by its own producer, Brian Grazer, as a "Fatal Attraction" for teens, this slick thriller holds no surprises but is still reasonably good visceral entertainment. Reese Witherspoon plays Nicole, a Typical Teen with an Overprotective Dad, Steve (William Petersen). Nicole chances to meet a hunky stranger named David (Mark Wahlberg, in one of his earliest starring gigs) and they enter into a passionate relationship, only for Nicole to realize that every suspicion that her dad has about her boyfriend is correct: the guy's a brutal, controlling thug. And he naturally doesn't take kindly to being dumped. Simply put, this is the kind of cretin who simply won't be denied what he wants. And he'll kill anybody to get it. "Fear" does benefit from very capable direction by James Foley ("Glengarry Glen Ross"), and impressive widescreen photography. This story does move along quite well without getting bogged down in any sort of filler. It's also quite sexy, to boot: Nicole and David have some steamy couplings along the way. The action gravitates right toward the kind of final showdown that we know from the start is going to be inevitable. As it happens, Steve foolishly gives Davids' equally seedy goon friends all the motivation they need to launch an assault on the family home. The movie is certainly well cast and all of the performances are effective. Also among the actors are Alyssa Milano as Witherspoons' friend and Amy Brenneman as the dads' new lady friend. Witherspoon is appealing and Wahlberg is convincing as the lovestruck antagonist. Overall this works pretty well at manipulating its audience and getting them all cranked up. The big finale is reasonably exciting and has some brutal moments. While this might not be innovative stuff in any way, it does do its job, and delivers the expected thrills. Seven out of 10.
