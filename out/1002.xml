    How did John Leguizamo become a sort of a star back in the 1990s? Well, this film is a testimony to the fact that he has no talent. It is the most annoying and unfunny comedy that I have ever witnessed. Watching this movie is like witnessing courtroom testimony. It is beyond boring. So how does John Leguizamo do it? Well, clearly he is one of those folks that represents an ethnic group and gets called whenever they need another Hispanic guy. Lequizamo is a walking stereotype of his ethnic group, and in many ways, he is a throwback to the Amos and Andy style of comedy, except it is in regards to Latinos. If you want to waste almost two hours of your time, then watch this movie.

    Only watched this to see Joe Morton in an early role and honestly wished I hadn't bothered, he can and has since, done much better than this crap. Cannot understand why anyone finds this kind of stupidity funny but each to his own; it is an absolute mess and not funny in the least. No wait, ONE line only was funny, where Mr Kent (Joe) and his family are having dinner with this nut job as he's been invited for dinner (Lord alone knows why). Pest to Mr Kent: You know what it's like dog, you've been there Mrs Kent: Not lately, Joe's expression was funny but that's it one line does not make a great comedy and this tat is so far away from being funny it should be consigned to the nearest trash cart, it's only good enough for that. Joe Morton - glad to see you don't appear in rubbish like this anymore; you are far superior and a great great actor.

    I received this as a Christmas present. I thought this movie was incredibly hilarious. It reminded me a lot of a story I read in high school called 'The Most Dangerous Game'John Leguizamo is wacky and crazy through the entire film. Leguizamo plays a sneaky, but lovable con-artist named Pestario Vargas, but everyone calls him 'Pest' He is tricked into being hunted down on a private Island by a racist German named Gustav. If Pest survives for 24 hours, Gustav will give him $50,000. When Pest escapes the Island, Gustav and his homosexual son continue to hunt him down in the city. Pest uses many disguises in order to stay alive, If you love silly zany comedies, you'll love THE PEST!!!

    my favorite parts of The Pest is the opening and ending credits of the movie. The movie its self is OK (it has its moments)but the story line gets very silly, and the whole movie the main character keeps on reminding you that he's called the pest for a reason, for he keeps on bugging everyone every second he's on screen so you could find your self getting bored sometimes. The main character (Pest) picks up multiple impressions with different cultural background to bug people with. My favorite impression with out a doubt has to be his Asian impressions. In conclusion, i love this movie because it's a classic ,and i would never get tired of watching the opening scene of The Pest.

    WOW who is on crack here? this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i forced myself to watch 40 or so minutes of it because of a friend but i just coulnt do it, i lasted through the vulgar poop jokes but as pukeing on each others faces began i knew i would rather trade places with john leguizamo and be the one shot and killed then watch this horror of a DVD. I just am thankful that movies like this are either no longer made or not mistaken as remotly funny but a horrible pest of a film and simple waste of time the world would be better off if this movie didn't exist wasting peoples time and money not to mention brain cell

    I actually joined this site simply to write in about this movie. I was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels. I made it about an hour through before I simply had enough. Curious to see what the general movie-opinionated public thought of this movie, I looked it up on this site. I was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people that thought it was great. I needed to have my say, and here it is: This movie is absolute garbage. It was a chore to sit through. The "jokes" were uninspired rehashes from other, better shows and movies, and Leguizamo's manic portrayal of this obnoxious character should only appeal to age ten and below. That actually may be a stretch even for that age. I'm all for slapstick ridiculousness, but there isn't even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness. I have an idea, lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed. Now that's funny. Ha. Ha. Movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality: The Marx Brothers' A Night at the Opera, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,...and the list goes on. Don't lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crap. By the way, I can only assume that the reason that David Bar Katz (the other writer) did VERY little in film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted. I'm actually impressed that Leguizamo was able to recover after this mess.

    This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I have to admit I didn't watch it from beginning to end as cleaning the toilet was more entertaining. The 'star' was the most unpleasant character I've ever seen, neither funny nor attractive, in fact, creepy and obnoxious are far too complimentary. It is painful to watch, there is no acting, especially not from the star who behaves as a doped up mentally deficient take off on one of those loud mouthed black actors. As horrible as it is to watch one of those can't shut up black actors, watching a Puerto Rican one is even worse. The name of the movie is descriptive, he is the pest. This movie is a must miss.

    At times when I watch this movie i start to think that the people who made this movie were on drugs.What's wrong with this film I'll tell you Bad Plot,Bad Jokes.Bad Acting and flat-out characters everything just bad. The movie is about Pest Vargas a two-bit scam hustler who is given the chance at $50,000 to survive for 24 hours by a German hunter who kills people for a living.so now Pest must think of ways to out think this hunter before he gets killed. I know what your thinking "What The Hell is this?" a another wannabe Ace Ventura trying to get money really this plot is just dull and confusing at times it changes the story plot and you get lost during the film. As for the funny scenes this film I had a straight face oh yeah I did smile a couple times but nothing laugh-out loud.besides the jokes are corny and seen before it's like watching Ace Ventura meets Dumb and Dumber but bad. As for character development it's dry and flat.You don't learn much about the main character Pest all you know is he's a annoying scam hustler but that's it he doesn't change his image or be a little smart just corny.as for The German hunter all you is that he's crazy and wants to go back to Germany.really you start to wonder why is this guy living on an island if has money to go to Germany.The hunter's son Himmel fares better but not much.He's really a coward and is snake-obsessed for reasons by the end He stands Up to his father and sides with Pest. As for the acting no only were there any memorable perforamces but just over the top.For example John Legizomo is so over the top with performance and dosen't fit in his role he's out of place as for Jeffery Jones who plays the hunter same thing but gives a stereotypical performance as well.as for the rest either just no used enough or just over the top. overall bad comedy that you'll find for $2.00 at K-Mart.

    What can I say about this film. Well I'd no intention of watching it when I did, before then I'd never heard of it, but sure enough on a bus trip in Eastern Europe I was going to take in the whole film. Well there we were, myself, my wife and two other travel buds on a bus from Plovdiv to Veliko Tarnovo in Bulgaria. It was a route I knew well, crappy road windy hills. Not a nice journey to experience whilst still in the depths of a Mastika hangover. Still these things have to be done. Any how this film just came up on our journey, and with a hangover it really was the funniest film I'd ever seen, although trying to watch it whilst trying not to be sick was something of a challenge. It had not helped that after a short pit stop on the way we got back on the bus last and had ended up on the worst seats, the one's at the back. So I might well just have been on a ferry crossing in rough seas. Going green doesn't't even describe it. Any back to the film, well this stupid idiotic film came on, and bizarrely enough it was excellent. Totally carried by the sharp intensity of lead actor, yes that guy that also did the voice over for the Ice Age Sloth. I felt like I was watching Jim Carrey before Jim Carriey's time. Only this guy John Leguizamo seemed to have even more energy. Needless to say I was constantly in stitches followed by the need for deep breaths and focus to overcome the nasty green spells. After a night on the sauce or during, I'd highly recommend this film. Certainly a departure from the main.

    This is the worst comedy i have ever seen !! I have seen a lot of comedy's and this was the first movie i stopped after 45 minutes because it was so annoying and NOT FUNNY AT ALL. The acting was very bad and Pestario 'pest'vargas (the leading part) Was the most annoying man i have ever seen i wanted to kill myself when i saw this movie. I was watching the movie with 10 family members and everyone hated the movie and they were all very relieved when i asked if anyone else hated it so much, when i asked it i heard 10 people saying YES !!!. So this is a warning do not watch this movie its horrible and a waist of your money.

    my favorite parts of The Pest is the opening and ending credits of the movie. The movie its self is OK (it has its moments)but the story line gets very silly, and the whole movie the main character keeps on reminding you that he's called the pest for a reason, for he keeps on bugging everyone every second he's on screen so you could find your self getting bored sometimes. The main character (Pest) picks up multiple impressions with different cultural background to bug people with. My favorite impression with out a doubt has to be his Asian impressions. In conclusion, i love this movie because it's a classic ,and i would never get tired of watching the opening scene of The Pest.

    WOW who is on crack here? this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i forced myself to watch 40 or so minutes of it because of a friend but i just coulnt do it, i lasted through the vulgar poop jokes but as pukeing on each others faces began i knew i would rather trade places with john leguizamo and be the one shot and killed then watch this horror of a DVD. I just am thankful that movies like this are either no longer made or not mistaken as remotly funny but a horrible pest of a film and simple waste of time the world would be better off if this movie didn't exist wasting peoples time and money not to mention brain cell

    I actually joined this site simply to write in about this movie. I was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels. I made it about an hour through before I simply had enough. Curious to see what the general movie-opinionated public thought of this movie, I looked it up on this site. I was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people that thought it was great. I needed to have my say, and here it is: This movie is absolute garbage. It was a chore to sit through. The "jokes" were uninspired rehashes from other, better shows and movies, and Leguizamo's manic portrayal of this obnoxious character should only appeal to age ten and below. That actually may be a stretch even for that age. I'm all for slapstick ridiculousness, but there isn't even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness. I have an idea, lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed. Now that's funny. Ha. Ha. Movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality: The Marx Brothers' A Night at the Opera, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,...and the list goes on. Don't lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crap. By the way, I can only assume that the reason that David Bar Katz (the other writer) did VERY little in film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted. I'm actually impressed that Leguizamo was able to recover after this mess.

    This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I have to admit I didn't watch it from beginning to end as cleaning the toilet was more entertaining. The 'star' was the most unpleasant character I've ever seen, neither funny nor attractive, in fact, creepy and obnoxious are far too complimentary. It is painful to watch, there is no acting, especially not from the star who behaves as a doped up mentally deficient take off on one of those loud mouthed black actors. As horrible as it is to watch one of those can't shut up black actors, watching a Puerto Rican one is even worse. The name of the movie is descriptive, he is the pest. This movie is a must miss.

    At times when I watch this movie i start to think that the people who made this movie were on drugs.What's wrong with this film I'll tell you Bad Plot,Bad Jokes.Bad Acting and flat-out characters everything just bad. The movie is about Pest Vargas a two-bit scam hustler who is given the chance at $50,000 to survive for 24 hours by a German hunter who kills people for a living.so now Pest must think of ways to out think this hunter before he gets killed. I know what your thinking "What The Hell is this?" a another wannabe Ace Ventura trying to get money really this plot is just dull and confusing at times it changes the story plot and you get lost during the film. As for the funny scenes this film I had a straight face oh yeah I did smile a couple times but nothing laugh-out loud.besides the jokes are corny and seen before it's like watching Ace Ventura meets Dumb and Dumber but bad. As for character development it's dry and flat.You don't learn much about the main character Pest all you know is he's a annoying scam hustler but that's it he doesn't change his image or be a little smart just corny.as for The German hunter all you is that he's crazy and wants to go back to Germany.really you start to wonder why is this guy living on an island if has money to go to Germany.The hunter's son Himmel fares better but not much.He's really a coward and is snake-obsessed for reasons by the end He stands Up to his father and sides with Pest. As for the acting no only were there any memorable perforamces but just over the top.For example John Legizomo is so over the top with performance and dosen't fit in his role he's out of place as for Jeffery Jones who plays the hunter same thing but gives a stereotypical performance as well.as for the rest either just no used enough or just over the top. overall bad comedy that you'll find for $2.00 at K-Mart.

    What can I say about this film. Well I'd no intention of watching it when I did, before then I'd never heard of it, but sure enough on a bus trip in Eastern Europe I was going to take in the whole film. Well there we were, myself, my wife and two other travel buds on a bus from Plovdiv to Veliko Tarnovo in Bulgaria. It was a route I knew well, crappy road windy hills. Not a nice journey to experience whilst still in the depths of a Mastika hangover. Still these things have to be done. Any how this film just came up on our journey, and with a hangover it really was the funniest film I'd ever seen, although trying to watch it whilst trying not to be sick was something of a challenge. It had not helped that after a short pit stop on the way we got back on the bus last and had ended up on the worst seats, the one's at the back. So I might well just have been on a ferry crossing in rough seas. Going green doesn't't even describe it. Any back to the film, well this stupid idiotic film came on, and bizarrely enough it was excellent. Totally carried by the sharp intensity of lead actor, yes that guy that also did the voice over for the Ice Age Sloth. I felt like I was watching Jim Carrey before Jim Carriey's time. Only this guy John Leguizamo seemed to have even more energy. Needless to say I was constantly in stitches followed by the need for deep breaths and focus to overcome the nasty green spells. After a night on the sauce or during, I'd highly recommend this film. Certainly a departure from the main.

    This is the worst comedy i have ever seen !! I have seen a lot of comedy's and this was the first movie i stopped after 45 minutes because it was so annoying and NOT FUNNY AT ALL. The acting was very bad and Pestario 'pest'vargas (the leading part) Was the most annoying man i have ever seen i wanted to kill myself when i saw this movie. I was watching the movie with 10 family members and everyone hated the movie and they were all very relieved when i asked if anyone else hated it so much, when i asked it i heard 10 people saying YES !!!. So this is a warning do not watch this movie its horrible and a waist of your money.

    How did John Leguizamo become a sort of a star back in the 1990s? Well, this film is a testimony to the fact that he has no talent. It is the most annoying and unfunny comedy that I have ever witnessed. Watching this movie is like witnessing courtroom testimony. It is beyond boring. So how does John Leguizamo do it? Well, clearly he is one of those folks that represents an ethnic group and gets called whenever they need another Hispanic guy. Lequizamo is a walking stereotype of his ethnic group, and in many ways, he is a throwback to the Amos and Andy style of comedy, except it is in regards to Latinos. If you want to waste almost two hours of your time, then watch this movie.

    Only watched this to see Joe Morton in an early role and honestly wished I hadn't bothered, he can and has since, done much better than this crap. Cannot understand why anyone finds this kind of stupidity funny but each to his own; it is an absolute mess and not funny in the least. No wait, ONE line only was funny, where Mr Kent (Joe) and his family are having dinner with this nut job as he's been invited for dinner (Lord alone knows why). Pest to Mr Kent: You know what it's like dog, you've been there Mrs Kent: Not lately, Joe's expression was funny but that's it one line does not make a great comedy and this tat is so far away from being funny it should be consigned to the nearest trash cart, it's only good enough for that. Joe Morton - glad to see you don't appear in rubbish like this anymore; you are far superior and a great great actor.

    I received this as a Christmas present. I thought this movie was incredibly hilarious. It reminded me a lot of a story I read in high school called 'The Most Dangerous Game'John Leguizamo is wacky and crazy through the entire film. Leguizamo plays a sneaky, but lovable con-artist named Pestario Vargas, but everyone calls him 'Pest' He is tricked into being hunted down on a private Island by a racist German named Gustav. If Pest survives for 24 hours, Gustav will give him $50,000. When Pest escapes the Island, Gustav and his homosexual son continue to hunt him down in the city.

    This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I have to admit I didn't watch it from beginning to end as cleaning the toilet was more entertaining. The 'star' was the most unpleasant character I've ever seen, neither funny nor attractive, in fact, creepy and obnoxious are far too complimentary. It is painful to watch, there is no acting, especially not from the star who behaves as a doped up mentally deficient take off on one of those loud mouthed black actors. As horrible as it is to watch one of those can't shut up black actors, watching a Puerto Rican one is even worse. The name of the movie is descriptive, he is the pest. This movie is a must miss.

    At times when I watch this movie i start to think that the people who made this movie were on drugs.What's wrong with this film I'll tell you Bad Plot,Bad Jokes.Bad Acting and flat-out characters everything just bad. The movie is about Pest Vargas a two-bit scam hustler who is given the chance at $50,000 to survive for 24 hours by a German hunter who kills people for a living.so now Pest must think of ways to out think this hunter before he gets killed. I know what your thinking "What The Hell is this?" a another wannabe Ace Ventura trying to get money really this plot is just dull and confusing at times it changes the story plot and you get lost during the film. As for the funny scenes this film I had a straight face oh yeah I did smile a couple times but nothing laugh-out loud.besides the jokes are corny and seen before it's like watching Ace Ventura meets Dumb and Dumber but bad. As for character development it's dry and flat.You don't learn much about the main character Pest all you know is he's a annoying scam hustler but that's it he doesn't change his image or be a little smart just corny.as for The German hunter all you is that he's crazy and wants to go back to Germany.really you start to wonder why is this guy living on an island if has money to go to Germany.The hunter's son Himmel fares better but not much.He's really a coward and is snake-obsessed for reasons by the end He stands Up to his father and sides with Pest. As for the acting no only were there any memorable perforamces but just over the top.For example John Legizomo is so over the top with performance and dosen't fit in his role he's out of place as for Jeffery Jones who plays the hunter same thing but gives a stereotypical performance as well.as for the rest either just no used enough or just over the top. overall bad comedy that you'll find for $2.00 at K-Mart.

    What can I say about this film. Well I'd no intention of watching it when I did, before then I'd never heard of it, but sure enough on a bus trip in Eastern Europe I was going to take in the whole film. Well there we were, myself, my wife and two other travel buds on a bus from Plovdiv to Veliko Tarnovo in Bulgaria. It was a route I knew well, crappy road windy hills. Not a nice journey to experience whilst still in the depths of a Mastika hangover. Still these things have to be done. Any how this film just came up on our journey, and with a hangover it really was the funniest film I'd ever seen, although trying to watch it whilst trying not to be sick was something of a challenge. It had not helped that after a short pit stop on the way we got back on the bus last and had ended up on the worst seats, the one's at the back. So I might well just have been on a ferry crossing in rough seas. Going green doesn't't even describe it. Any back to the film, well this stupid idiotic film came on, and bizarrely enough it was excellent. Totally carried by the sharp intensity of lead actor, yes that guy that also did the voice over for the Ice Age Sloth. I felt like I was watching Jim Carrey before Jim Carriey's time. Only this guy John Leguizamo seemed to have even more energy. Needless to say I was constantly in stitches followed by the need for deep breaths and focus to overcome the nasty green spells. After a night on the sauce or during, I'd highly recommend this film. Certainly a departure from the main.

    This is the worst comedy i have ever seen !! I have seen a lot of comedy's and this was the first movie i stopped after 45 minutes because it was so annoying and NOT FUNNY AT ALL. The acting was very bad and Pestario 'pest'vargas (the leading part) Was the most annoying man i have ever seen i wanted to kill myself when i saw this movie. I was watching the movie with 10 family members and everyone hated the movie and they were all very relieved when i asked if anyone else hated it so much, when i asked it i heard 10 people saying YES !!!. So this is a warning do not watch this movie its horrible and a waist of your money.

    How did John Leguizamo become a sort of a star back in the 1990s? Well, this film is a testimony to the fact that he has no talent. It is the most annoying and unfunny comedy that I have ever witnessed. Watching this movie is like witnessing courtroom testimony. It is beyond boring. So how does John Leguizamo do it? Well, clearly he is one of those folks that represents an ethnic group and gets called whenever they need another Hispanic guy. Lequizamo is a walking stereotype of his ethnic group, and in many ways, he is a throwback to the Amos and Andy style of comedy, except it is in regards to Latinos. If you want to waste almost two hours of your time, then watch this movie.

    Only watched this to see Joe Morton in an early role and honestly wished I hadn't bothered, he can and has since, done much better than this crap. Cannot understand why anyone finds this kind of stupidity funny but each to his own; it is an absolute mess and not funny in the least. No wait, ONE line only was funny, where Mr Kent (Joe) and his family are having dinner with this nut job as he's been invited for dinner (Lord alone knows why). Pest to Mr Kent: You know what it's like dog, you've been there Mrs Kent: Not lately, Joe's expression was funny but that's it one line does not make a great comedy and this tat is so far away from being funny it should be consigned to the nearest trash cart, it's only good enough for that. Joe Morton - glad to see you don't appear in rubbish like this anymore; you are far superior and a great great actor.

    I received this as a Christmas present. I thought this movie was incredibly hilarious. It reminded me a lot of a story I read in high school called 'The Most Dangerous Game'John Leguizamo is wacky and crazy through the entire film. Leguizamo plays a sneaky, but lovable con-artist named Pestario Vargas, but everyone calls him 'Pest' He is tricked into being hunted down on a private Island by a racist German named Gustav. If Pest survives for 24 hours, Gustav will give him $50,000. When Pest escapes the Island, Gustav and his homosexual son continue to hunt him down in the city. Pest uses many disguises in order to stay alive, If you love silly zany comedies, you'll love THE PEST!!!

    my favorite parts of The Pest is the opening and ending credits of the movie. The movie its self is OK (it has its moments)but the story line gets very silly, and the whole movie the main character keeps on reminding you that he's called the pest for a reason, for he keeps on bugging everyone every second he's on screen so you could find your self getting bored sometimes. The main character (Pest) picks up multiple impressions with different cultural background to bug people with. My favorite impression with out a doubt has to be his Asian impressions. In conclusion, i love this movie because it's a classic ,and i would never get tired of watching the opening scene of The Pest.

I just am thankful that movies like this are either no longer made or not mistaken as remotly funny but a horrible pest of a film and simple waste of time the world would be better off if this movie didn't exist wasting peoples time and money not to mention brain cell

    I actually joined this site simply to write in about this movie. I was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels. I made it about an hour through before I simply had enough. Curious to see what the general movie-opinionated public thought of this movie, I looked it up on this site. I was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people that thought it was great. I needed to have my say, and here it is: This movie is absolute garbage. It was a chore to sit through. The "jokes" were uninspired rehashes from other, better shows and movies, and Leguizamo's manic portrayal of this obnoxious character should only appeal to age ten and below. That actually may be a stretch even for that age. I'm all for slapstick ridiculousness, but there isn't even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness. I have an idea, lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed. Now that's funny. Ha. Ha. Movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality: The Marx Brothers' A Night at the Opera, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,...and the list goes on. Don't lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crap. By the way, I can only assume that the reason that David Bar Katz (the other writer) did VERY little in film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted. I'm actually impressed that Leguizamo was able to recover after this mess.

The acting was very bad and Pestario 'pest'vargas (the leading part) Was the most annoying man i have ever seen i wanted to kill myself when i saw this movie. I was watching the movie with 10 family members and everyone hated the movie and they were all very relieved when i asked if anyone else hated it so much, when i asked it i heard 10 people saying YES !!!. So this is a warning do not watch this movie its horrible and a waist of your money.

    How did John Leguizamo become a sort of a star back in the 1990s? Well, this film is a testimony to the fact that he has no talent. It is the most annoying and unfunny comedy that I have ever witnessed. Watching this movie is like witnessing courtroom testimony. It is beyond boring. So how does John Leguizamo do it? Well, clearly he is one of those folks that represents an ethnic group and gets called whenever they need another Hispanic guy. Lequizamo is a walking stereotype of his ethnic group, and in many ways, he is a throwback to the Amos and Andy style of comedy, except it is in regards to Latinos. If you want to waste almost two hours of your time, then watch this movie.

    Only watched this to see Joe Morton in an early role and honestly wished I hadn't bothered, he can and has since, done much better than this crap. Cannot understand why anyone finds this kind of stupidity funny but each to his own; it is an absolute mess and not funny in the least. No wait, ONE line only was funny, where Mr Kent (Joe) and his family are having dinner with this nut job as he's been invited for dinner (Lord alone knows why). Pest to Mr Kent: You know what it's like dog, you've been there Mrs Kent: Not lately, Joe's expression was funny but that's it one line does not make a great comedy and this tat is so far away from being funny it should be consigned to the nearest trash cart, it's only good enough for that. Joe Morton - glad to see you don't appear in rubbish like this anymore; you are far superior and a great great actor.

    I received this as a Christmas present. I thought this movie was incredibly hilarious. It reminded me a lot of a story I read in high school called 'The Most Dangerous Game'John Leguizamo is wacky and crazy through the entire film. Leguizamo plays a sneaky, but lovable con-artist named Pestario Vargas, but everyone calls him 'Pest' He is tricked into being hunted down on a private Island by a racist German named Gustav. If Pest survives for 24 hours, Gustav will give him $50,000. When Pest escapes the Island, Gustav and his homosexual son continue to hunt him down in the city. Pest uses many disguises in order to stay alive, If you love silly zany comedies, you'll love THE PEST!!!

    my favorite parts of The Pest is the opening and ending credits of the movie. The movie its self is OK (it has its moments)but the story line gets very silly, and the whole movie the main character keeps on reminding you that he's called the pest for a reason, for he keeps on bugging everyone every second he's on screen so you could find your self getting bored sometimes. The main character (Pest) picks up multiple impressions with different cultural background to bug people with. My favorite impression with out a doubt has to be his Asian impressions. In conclusion, i love this movie because it's a classic ,and i would never get tired of watching the opening scene of The Pest.

    WOW who is on crack here? this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i forced myself to watch 40 or so minutes of it because of a friend but i just coulnt do it, i lasted through the vulgar poop jokes but as pukeing on each others faces began i knew i would rather trade places with john leguizamo and be the one shot and killed then watch this horror of a DVD. I just am thankful that movies like this are either no longer made or not mistaken as remotly funny but a horrible pest of a film and simple waste of time the world would be better off if this movie didn't exist wasting peoples time and money not to mention brain cell

    I actually joined this site simply to write in about this movie. I was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels. I made it about an hour through before I simply had enough. Curious to see what the general movie-opinionated public thought of this movie, I looked it up on this site. I was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people that thought it was great. I needed to have my say, and here it is: This movie is absolute garbage. It was a chore to sit through. The "jokes" were uninspired rehashes from other, better shows and movies, and Leguizamo's manic portrayal of this obnoxious character should only appeal to age ten and below. That actually may be a stretch even for that age. I'm all for slapstick ridiculousness, but there isn't even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness. I have an idea, lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed. Now that's funny. Ha. Ha. Movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality: The Marx Brothers' A Night at the Opera, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,...and the list goes on. Don't lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crap. By the way, I can only assume that the reason that David Bar Katz (the other writer) did VERY little in film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted. I'm actually impressed that Leguizamo was able to recover after this mess.

    This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I have to admit I didn't watch it from beginning to end as cleaning the toilet was more entertaining. The 'star' was the most unpleasant character I've ever seen, neither funny nor attractive, in fact, creepy and obnoxious are far too complimentary. It is painful to watch, there is no acting, especially not from the star who behaves as a doped up mentally deficient take off on one of those loud mouthed black actors. As horrible as it is to watch one of those can't shut up black actors, watching a Puerto Rican one is even worse. The name of the movie is descriptive, he is the pest. This movie is a must miss.

    At times when I watch this movie i start to think that the people who made this movie were on drugs.What's wrong with this film I'll tell you Bad Plot,Bad Jokes.Bad Acting and flat-out characters everything just bad. The movie is about Pest Vargas a two-bit scam hustler who is given the chance at $50,000 to survive for 24 hours by a German hunter who kills people for a living.so now Pest must think of ways to out think this hunter before he gets killed. I know what your thinking "What The Hell is this?" a another wannabe Ace Ventura trying to get money really this plot is just dull and confusing at times it changes the story plot and you get lost during the film. As for the funny scenes this film I had a straight face oh yeah I did smile a couple times but nothing laugh-out loud.besides the jokes are corny and seen before it's like watching Ace Ventura meets Dumb and Dumber but bad. As for character development it's dry and flat.You don't learn much about the main character Pest all you know is he's a annoying scam hustler but that's it he doesn't change his image or be a little smart just corny.as for The German hunter all you is that he's crazy and wants to go back to Germany.really you start to wonder why is this guy living on an island if has money to go to Germany.The hunter's son Himmel fares better but not much.He's really a coward and is snake-obsessed for reasons by the end He stands Up to his father and sides with Pest. As for the acting no only were there any memorable perforamces but just over the top.For example John Legizomo is so over the top with performance and dosen't fit in his role he's out of place as for Jeffery Jones who plays the hunter same thing but gives a stereotypical performance as well.as for the rest either just no used enough or just over the top. overall bad comedy that you'll find for $2.00 at K-Mart.

    What can I say about this film. Well I'd no intention of watching it when I did, before then I'd never heard of it, but sure enough on a bus trip in Eastern Europe I was going to take in the whole film. Well there we were, myself, my wife and two other travel buds on a bus from Plovdiv to Veliko Tarnovo in Bulgaria. It was a route I knew well, crappy road windy hills. Not a nice journey to experience whilst still in the depths of a Mastika hangover. Still these things have to be done. Any how this film just came up on our journey, and with a hangover it really was the funniest film I'd ever seen, although trying to watch it whilst trying not to be sick was something of a challenge. It had not helped that after a short pit stop on the way we got back on the bus last and had ended up on the worst seats, the one's at the back. So I might well just have been on a ferry crossing in rough seas. Going green doesn't't even describe it. Any back to the film, well this stupid idiotic film came on, and bizarrely enough it was excellent. Totally carried by the sharp intensity of lead actor, yes that guy that also did the voice over for the Ice Age Sloth. I felt like I was watching Jim Carrey before Jim Carriey's time. Only this guy John Leguizamo seemed to have even more energy. Needless to say I was constantly in stitches followed by the need for deep breaths and focus to overcome the nasty green spells. After a night on the sauce or during, I'd highly recommend this film. Certainly a departure from the main.

    WOW who is on crack here? this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i forced myself to watch 40 or so minutes of it because of a friend but i just coulnt do it, i lasted through the vulgar poop jokes but as pukeing on each others faces began i knew i would rather trade places with john leguizamo and be the one shot and killed then watch this horror of a DVD. I just am thankful that movies like this are either no longer made or not mistaken as remotly funny but a horrible pest of a film and simple waste of time the world would be better off if this movie didn't exist wasting peoples time and money not to mention brain cell

    I actually joined this site simply to write in about this movie. I was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels. I made it about an hour through before I simply had enough. Curious to see what the general movie-opinionated public thought of this movie, I looked it up on this site. I was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people that thought it was great. I needed to have my say, and here it is: This movie is absolute garbage. It was a chore to sit through. The "jokes" were uninspired rehashes from other, better shows and movies, and Leguizamo's manic portrayal of this obnoxious character should only appeal to age ten and below. That actually may be a stretch even for that age. I'm all for slapstick ridiculousness, but there isn't even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness. I have an idea, lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed. Now that's funny. Ha. Ha. Movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality: The Marx Brothers' A Night at the Opera, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,...and the list goes on. Don't lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crap. By the way, I can only assume that the reason that David Bar Katz (the other writer) did VERY little in film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted. I'm actually impressed that Leguizamo was able to recover after this mess.

    This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I have to admit I didn't watch it from beginning to end as cleaning the toilet was more entertaining. The 'star' was the most unpleasant character I've ever seen, neither funny nor attractive, in fact, creepy and obnoxious are far too complimentary. It is painful to watch, there is no acting, especially not from the star who behaves as a doped up mentally deficient take off on one of those loud mouthed black actors. As horrible as it is to watch one of those can't shut up black actors, watching a Puerto Rican one is even worse. The name of the movie is descriptive, he is the pest. This movie is a must miss.

    At times when I watch this movie i start to think that the people who made this movie were on drugs.What's wrong with this film I'll tell you Bad Plot,Bad Jokes.Bad Acting and flat-out characters everything just bad. The movie is about Pest Vargas a two-bit scam hustler who is given the chance at $50,000 to survive for 24 hours by a German hunter who kills people for a living.so now Pest must think of ways to out think this hunter before he gets killed. I know what your thinking "What The Hell is this?" a another wannabe Ace Ventura trying to get money really this plot is just dull and confusing at times it changes the story plot and you get lost during the film. As for the funny scenes this film I had a straight face oh yeah I did smile a couple times but nothing laugh-out loud.besides the jokes are corny and seen before it's like watching Ace Ventura meets Dumb and Dumber but bad. As for character development it's dry and flat.You don't learn much about the main character Pest all you know is he's a annoying scam hustler but that's it he doesn't change his image or be a little smart just corny.as for The German hunter all you is that he's crazy and wants to go back to Germany.really you start to wonder why is this guy living on an island if has money to go to Germany.The hunter's son Himmel fares better but not much.He's really a coward and is snake-obsessed for reasons by the end He stands Up to his father and sides with Pest. As for the acting no only were there any memorable perforamces but just over the top.For example John Legizomo is so over the top with performance and dosen't fit in his role he's out of place as for Jeffery Jones who plays the hunter same thing but gives a stereotypical performance as well.as for the rest either just no used enough or just over the top. overall bad comedy that you'll find for $2.00 at K-Mart.

    What can I say about this film. Well I'd no intention of watching it when I did, before then I'd never heard of it, but sure enough on a bus trip in Eastern Europe I was going to take in the whole film. Well there we were, myself, my wife and two other travel buds on a bus from Plovdiv to Veliko Tarnovo in Bulgaria. It was a route I knew well, crappy road windy hills. Not a nice journey to experience whilst still in the depths of a Mastika hangover. Still these things have to be done. Any how this film just came up on our journey, and with a hangover it really was the funniest film I'd ever seen, although trying to watch it whilst trying not to be sick was something of a challenge. It had not helped that after a short pit stop on the way we got back on the bus last and had ended up on the worst seats, the one's at the back. So I might well just have been on a ferry crossing in rough seas. Going green doesn't't even describe it. Any back to the film, well this stupid idiotic film came on, and bizarrely enough it was excellent. Totally carried by the sharp intensity of lead actor, yes that guy that also did the voice over for the Ice Age Sloth. I felt like I was watching Jim Carrey before Jim Carriey's time. Only this guy John Leguizamo seemed to have even more energy. Needless to say I was constantly in stitches followed by the need for deep breaths and focus to overcome the nasty green spells. After a night on the sauce or during, I'd highly recommend this film. Certainly a departure from the main.

    This is the worst comedy i have ever seen !! I have seen a lot of comedy's and this was the first movie i stopped after 45 minutes because it was so annoying and NOT FUNNY AT ALL. The acting was very bad and Pestario 'pest'vargas (the leading part) Was the most annoying man i have ever seen i wanted to kill myself when i saw this movie. I was watching the movie with 10 family members and everyone hated the movie and they were all very relieved when i asked if anyone else hated it so much, when i asked it i heard 10 people saying YES !!!. So this is a warning do not watch this movie its horrible and a waist of your money.
