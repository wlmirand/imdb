 <sinopse>
  When a sports agent has a moral epiphany and is fired for expressing it, he decides to put his new philosophy to the test as an independent with the only athlete who stays with him.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a successful sports agent. The biggest clients, the respect, a beautiful fianc&eacute;e, he has it all. Until one night he questions his purpose. His place in the world, and finally comes to terms with what's wrong with his career and life. Recording all his thoughts in a mission statement Jerry feels he has a new lease on life. Unfortunately his opinions aren't met with enthusiasm from his superiors and after dishonorably being stripped of his high earning clients and elite status within the agency Jerry steps out into the sports business armed with only one volatile client (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and the only person with belief in his abilities (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) with the impossible task of rebuilding what he once had. Along the way he faces the harsh truths which he'd ignored in the past and a host of hardships that he'd never faced before.

    Tom Cruise plays a big time professional Agent signing the big names. supposedly it's loosely based on a major professional real life agent. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a highly skilled football player who just wants to get paid,, hence the phrase and catchline... "Show me the Money". or as Prime Time Deion Sanders would say,,, Pay the Man.. this is a story about how much our sports agent will take and go thru to make his clients happy,, it seems he will have to sell his soul in order to please them,, he decides that working for the agency he's had enough,, and he starts his own agency and takes a beautiful young helper with him,, together they start up his own business, of him being a free lance agent. he tries to spend time at home, as his job requires him to be away a lot, and it just isn't working out for him,, his client keeps bugging him about his new contract deal,, and wanting to get paid.. this movie takes a look at a different sides of sports... very interesting,, just I think Cruise wasn't up to his usual great performance in this one.

    Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a hotshot sports agent. As such, he wants to get the fattest contracts for his clients because his own salary depends on it. He has a type A girlfriend, Avery (Kelly Preston) and a seemingly great life. But, one day, he has an epiphany. Jerry has seen the tears in the eyes of the children who wonder why Mr. Maguire is still talking money when their father or mother is gravely injured and probably shouldn't play again. Therefore, Jerry pens an open letter to his fellow agents at their huge firm, asking them to follow their hearts and not just the dollar signs. Although everyone initially claps Jer on the back, he is soon dumped. The executioner" (Jay Mohr), a more senior agent, does it in a crowded restaurant where he also announces his plans to "takeover" everyone of Maguire's clients. All too soon it happens. Jerry retains only one athlete, Rod (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an iffy client due to injuries. Cleaning out his desk, Jerry bravely tells the entire office he is opening his own agency and asks someone, anyone to go with him. Only one does. That would be Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), a single mother of one darling son, Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki), who admired greatly the stance he took in his open letter. Yet, for both Jerry and Dorothy, the whole start-up biz is an extreme risk, with only one sure client. Meanwhile, Avery dumps her fianc&eacute; on his ear when he loses the chance to represent a rookie NFL quarterback. Truth is, Jerry's old agency told a bunch of lies to steal this young man away. To complicate matters more, Jerry asks Dorothy out on a date, which goes well. Can romance and infant businesses make a good mix? Will Maguire, who stuck his head out for something good, now have it chopped off in the cruel world of capitalism? This is without a doubt Cruise's most enjoyable flick. Even folks who think they don't care for him will enjoy this one. It doesn't hurt, of course, to have sidekicks in Zellweger, Gooding, Jr., Bonnie Hunt, Mohr, Preston and the darling Lipnicki. Then, too, Cameron Crowe, who wrote and directed this gem, deserves lots of praise as well. To complete the movie's success are great costumes, sets, and photography. Come on, folks, re-runs of The Big Valley are nice but why not snag this film instead if you've never had the pleasure of it?

    Amusing comedy drama that alternates between being a mockery of greed in the sports world and romantic comedy. Tom Cruise, in one of his best roles, plays sports agent Jerry Maguire. He is tired of the cynicism in the sports world. When he gets fired and is starting his own business, it is only two who believe in him to succeed. A secretary (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) and a promising player (Cuba Gooding Jr.) in American football. The questions then become two: Will Jerry Maguire get back together with the secretary, who is a single mother? Is the football player going to become a star? The film was nominated for many awards, including best film, but only Cuba Gooding Jr. won an Oscar, then for Best Supporting Actor. Cameron Crowe's film is filled with so much humor, charm and warmth, that it does not matter that it is a bit predictable.

    "I didn't know it was a romantic comedy." Kristl said. She was leaning back into the couch in the garage turned movie theater,"I was completely fooled by the name and the fact it said someone wrote a statement against greed in sports. I thought it would be a drama in which someone rejects greed. Instead it is just a story vehicle to have two people meet." "I didn't know either. A romantic comedy! The last one I saw was When Harry met Sally. I think that was more than enough romcom to last me a lifetime." Henry laid down the remote. "So what now?" "Maybe we ought to sit it out..You know, can we judge a movie based on the first thirty minutes? Although it has Tom Cruise in it. A romantic comedy with Tom Cruise. That is so wrong." "And no action. And Renee Zellweger..the girl that looks like she is perpetually on the verge of a nervous breakdown and about to cry. I think she can't really act, just plays one person called Renee Zellweger with one facial expression." "She does it very well though. But Tom Cruise as an love interest. Horrible. I can't see him as a nice man in this movie, but as a sleek guy with a fake smile... but most of all, his cold eyes.. Brr." Kristl shivered, "But he was great in movies like Born on the Fourth of July, or Rain Man or Collateral." "To be fair we ought to watch a movie with Tom Cruise at his best. A movie where he kicks ass," Henry said, "Like Mission Impossible." "Beg your pardon?" Kristl raised an eyebrow. "Minority Report then?" "Are you serious?" "The Last Samurai?" "Nope." Kristl shook her head. "What then? Not Rain Man please" "How about Collateral?" "It's a deal."

    Jerry Maguire is what it is because it blends everything it has to begin with, with talented writing and phenomenal performances from Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. This story at first is in a way, a satire of American sports. Everything from NFL drafts to player's wages, the film exploits everything in between at the very beginning. At first, Jerry Maguire is Tom Cruise. Literally, this is the same character that Cruise has played in every film since Risky Business. However, you really get to know the character and feel great sympathy for him. He certainly did not deserve everything to happen to him, and you really get a great sense of his peers as well. Is this really what it is, or more like, is this really how it is? Either way this is the best performance of Tom Cruise's career hands-down. Cuba Gooding Jr is the real star of the show. He deserved his best supporting actor Oscar as much as Cruise deserved his best actor. The two work well off each other, and you really anticipate the next time they are on screen together. The film slowly evolves into a love story, not only between Cruise and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, but the bond between Cruise and Cuba. This is a film that works, every cheesy but quotable line, every chuckle from Cuba Gooding Jr being an outlandish diva and every time you realize that this is a film that is much deeper than what you may have thought. Go see it.

    Jerry Maguire is now pop culture reference material. "You had me at Hello" and "You complete me" are some of the most commonly quoted movie phrase in North America. Underneath that is a romance born of unusual circumstances. The good. Very interesting story with a unique setup. Well paced scenario. Excellent character psychology and interactions. The actors. Tom Cruise goes all out, but his best scenes are the ones where he's calm. Cuba Gooding Jr. is just spot on as the self-centered athlete. And Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is at her cutest and most vulnerable as the lost single mother. The bad. Acting exaggerations on the part of Cruise and Gooding. It's probably what made it popular in the first place, but watching it now, for the third time, it's unnerving. Also, the kid might have been cute the first time you see the flick, but he's really not a good child actor. The ugly. Quarterback Troy Aikman shows once again that professional athlete can't act to save their lives. It's a good thing he's got only two lines. The result. Very good entertainment for the romantics with a bit of sport thrown in the mix.

    This is a Tom Cruise movie, but I did not hold that against it. For some reason I wanted to see this movie, not because it was a Tom Cruise movie, but because of the plot about how the main character, Jerry Maguire, lost his job as a sports agent and then went out on his own to build up his empire again. The plot is not that shallow, rather the character of Maguire begins as a business orientated, money loving, sports agent until he is confronted with the reality of his character through the hatred of the son of a badly injured ice hockey player. At this point he realises that his desire is to purely make money off of other people and that he does not care about the person whom he is making money off. At that point he writes a mission statement which he intends to change the whole industry with - and even though he is congratulated with his stand, the competitiveness of the industry means that the younger agents seize this moment of weakness and throw him out. In the ensuing struggle he manages to gain two stars to work for, and then the famous one walks out on him leaving his with an angry black football player who wants a great contract but is not willing to work for it. Through the movie we see Maguire's character struggle through his problems, and his character rely on what are defined as his weaknesses. At the bachelor party at the beginning his one major weakness is revealed: he needs a woman to support him - he cannot be alone. So when he looses his job, he also walks out on his star fianc&eacute;e because he simply feels that he does not deserve her. He has lost everything else so by all intents and purposes, he should loose her as well. This is where the other character comes in. An accountant at the firm Maguire worked for who was inspired by his mission statement. When Maguire calls for people to leave with him, she is the only one who does, but she also has a desire - she wants an husband and a father for her child. This is strengthened through the movie as she continues to look at people in love and think about how she wants that for himself. This is bad because Maguire can't be alone, and she knows that, so she sees her chance and takes him. The thing that makes this a little different is that Maguire loves her kid. This weakness of Maguire's is continually exploited as he struggles with his single client, who is so stubborn that he refuses to leave Maquire, but he also refuses to listen to Maguire's advice. In the end they must settle with a weak contract because there is little else that they can get. It is only when he breaks out of his shell that things start to happen, and because Maguire has been his friend as well as his agent, this relationship is strengthened. But his character is also there to show what a strong marriage relationship is all about. As we watch Maguire and his secretary romanticise over each other, we know that it is not a relationship of love, but one of necessity. When they do get married, we know that it is because Maguire simply does not want her to leave as opposed to really loving her. The illusionary relationship is developed as it is contrasted with that of Maguire's client. We see a husband and wife who truly love each other, while Maguire and his wife seem to drift apart as Maguire spends more time with his client and his son. This is a great movie, and it is surprisingly deep for an American movie. The characters are finely crafted and they each have to struggle through their problems, all of them looking for the easy way out but knowing that it is not the best way out. For a Tom Cruise movie, it is actually quite good.

    I will try to not parrot what has already been said about the movie, for better or worse. I have nothing against the actors of the feature film. They were the best of the best in that genre and generation. My issue is with all the product placement and overall marketing that the film is bombarded with ranging from Reebok, Apple Jacks, NFL and I don't know how many other products. If one is not discerning, one can fall for it and feel like ESPN is the ultimate authority in sports and that the NFL is the best thing that there is. I won't question the integrity of these entities because that's not what this review is about. The cameos from real life corporate executives further reinforced the marketing at play her. I just think that it would have felt more artistic and original to have come up with a pretend organization resembling the ones mentioned so that the viewer is not resold on the idea that big corporations truly benefit humanity and actually constitute a culture. For a movie about redemption and love, there is the underlying message that money and materialism is the agent that facilitates can destroy and redeem you. This may be true, and I am no bleeding heart; but movies should not always reinforce the obvious. One of the more positive aspects of the movie was seeing the Tidwell's as a normal and married black couple rather than bickering losers having illegitimate offspring. You could see Crowe's sensitivity and trying to elevate the dialogue without being soppy. I think what made this movie so zeitgeist was that it captured and incorporated the rampant and materialism of the 1990s. This decade was more greedy than the 80s because suddenly actors and athletes had the fattest paychecks simply for being entertainers. They suddenly became royalty. This decade was the beginning of the endorsement culture that blew up in the 2000s. The general public truly believed that bigger was better and resented being told otherwise. SUV's, designer clothes, limitless credit cards, supersized meals and Venti sized coffee's were almost a requirement. If you want to see a well acted film you will not be disappointed. I recommend looking at the movie with a grain of salt and detaching oneself from the underlying capitalist and elitist message that it sends.

    I like Tom Cruise, he plays Tom Cruise really well, and this is no different. Jerry Maguire is a Sports Agent who after an epiphany of conscience sets up on his own. That's when Renee Zellweger brings the unlikely into the plot. Everything apart from Jerry's relationship with Dorothy in this film is plausible. Bonnie Hunt (always a good bet) plays the sensible sister whom Dorothy could listen to once in a while. Sure it plays out in true Hollywood fashion - yay - but I get angry at characters like Dorothy Boyd, annoying and silly. Tom is great, Jay Mohr (Sugar, the rival agent) plays sleaze so well, Cuba Gooding Jnr's flamboyant extrovert over-the-top manic is perfect for his role as Rod Tidwell and he really brings some crazy sanity to the other side of the plot which is the schmaltz of Jerry and Dorothy and corny dialogue. His relationship with Jerry is heartwarming, and the bromance between them is the real love interest of the film. Regina King is great as Mrs Tidwell, although I've only seen her play similar roles. Jerry Maquire is rightly hailed as a modern classic film, and whilst I find the romance between Dorothy and Jerry a little ridiculous and far-fetched, it does make it appeal to a wider audience that would other wise be only sports fans. It makes the film cover more genres, makes it different to other sports-films by giving it a number of story threads. Whilst it is predictable and has a very Hollywood ending, you don't really mind as it rounds the package of this film off nicely and it wouldn't have worked so well any other way. Special mention in this film has to go to little Jonathan Lipnicki who plays Dorothy (Renee's) son Ray; he's as cute as a button and adds some rather natural acting for one so young (age 5) as the child who melts Jerry a little bit. Overall, a great movie you can watch over and over, and one of Tom's best roles.

    You can tell after watching Jerry Maguire that this movie isn't in it for just some quick money. The movie has a lot of heart and a great sense of humor to back it up. The story is simple enough, a sports agent loses his job and is desperately trying to keep his head above water in the sports business. He falls in love along the way and it turns into a love story. This movie has a great cast including a Tom Cruise who is wonderful in it. Cruise straddles the line between desperate and crazy with Jerry Maguire and in the process delivers some hilarious scenes (SHOW ME THE MONEY). Cuba Gooding Jr. is strong throughout (as he and Maguire are almost equals in their life situation). The film manages to not go to melodramatic and keep the comedy coming. For me, the whole movie is made by Tom Cruise. In particular, I find his reactions hilarious. The firing sequence along with his facial expressions when answering the devastating phone-call in Cushman's apartment are prime examples of Cruise's greatness in this movie. If you want a flick that is smart and witty but also offers up an engaging love-story and interesting plot, look no further than Jerry Maguire.

Underneath that is a romance born of unusual circumstances. The good. Very interesting story with a unique setup. Well paced scenario. Excellent character psychology and interactions. The actors. Tom Cruise goes all out, but his best scenes are the ones where he's calm. Cuba Gooding Jr. is just spot on as the self-centered athlete. And Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is at her cutest and most vulnerable as the lost single mother. The bad. Acting exaggerations on the part of Cruise and Gooding. It's probably what made it popular in the first place, but watching it now, for the third time, it's unnerving. Also, the kid might have been cute the first time you see the flick, but he's really not a good child actor. The ugly. Quarterback Troy Aikman shows once again that professional athlete can't act to save their lives. It's a good thing he's got only two lines. The result. Very good entertainment for the romantics with a bit of sport thrown in the mix.

    This is a Tom Cruise movie, but I did not hold that against it. For some reason I wanted to see this movie, not because it was a Tom Cruise movie, but because of the plot about how the main character, Jerry Maguire, lost his job as a sports agent and then went out on his own to build up his empire again. The plot is not that shallow, rather the character of Maguire begins as a business orientated, money loving, sports agent until he is confronted with the reality of his character through the hatred of the son of a badly injured ice hockey player. At this point he realises that his desire is to purely make money off of other people and that he does not care about the person whom he is making money off. At that point he writes a mission statement which he intends to change the whole industry with - and even though he is congratulated with his stand, the competitiveness of the industry means that the younger agents seize this moment of weakness and throw him out. In the ensuing struggle he manages to gain two stars to work for, and then the famous one walks out on him leaving his with an angry black football player who wants a great contract but is not willing to work for it. Through the movie we see Maguire's character struggle through his problems, and his character rely on what are defined as his weaknesses. At the bachelor party at the beginning his one major weakness is revealed: he needs a woman to support him - he cannot be alone. So when he looses his job, he also walks out on his star fianc&eacute;e because he simply feels that he does not deserve her. He has lost everything else so by all intents and purposes, he should loose her as well. This is where the other character comes in. An accountant at the firm Maguire worked for who was inspired by his mission statement. When Maguire calls for people to leave with him, she is the only one who does, but she also has a desire - she wants an husband and a father for her child. This is strengthened through the movie as she continues to look at people in love and think about how she wants that for himself. This is bad because Maguire can't be alone, and she knows that, so she sees her chance and takes him. The thing that makes this a little different is that Maguire loves her kid. This weakness of Maguire's is continually exploited as he struggles with his single client, who is so stubborn that he refuses to leave Maquire, but he also refuses to listen to Maguire's advice. In the end they must settle with a weak contract because there is little else that they can get. It is only when he breaks out of his shell that things start to happen, and because Maguire has been his friend as well as his agent, this relationship is strengthened. But his character is also there to show what a strong marriage relationship is all about. As we watch Maguire and his secretary romanticise over each other, we know that it is not a relationship of love, but one of necessity. When they do get married, we know that it is because Maguire simply does not want her to leave as opposed to really loving her. The illusionary relationship is developed as it is contrasted with that of Maguire's client. We see a husband and wife who truly love each other, while Maguire and his wife seem to drift apart as Maguire spends more time with his client and his son. This is a great movie, and it is surprisingly deep for an American movie. The characters are finely crafted and they each have to struggle through their problems, all of them looking for the easy way out but knowing that it is not the best way out. For a Tom Cruise movie, it is actually quite good.

    I will try to not parrot what has already been said about the movie, for better or worse. I have nothing against the actors of the feature film. They were the best of the best in that genre and generation. My issue is with all the product placement and overall marketing that the film is bombarded with ranging from Reebok, Apple Jacks, NFL and I don't know how many other products. If one is not discerning, one can fall for it and feel like ESPN is the ultimate authority in sports and that the NFL is the best thing that there is. I won't question the integrity of these entities because that's not what this review is about. The cameos from real life corporate executives further reinforced the marketing at play her. I just think that it would have felt more artistic and original to have come up with a pretend organization resembling the ones mentioned so that the viewer is not resold on the idea that big corporations truly benefit humanity and actually constitute a culture. For a movie about redemption and love, there is the underlying message that money and materialism is the agent that facilitates can destroy and redeem you. This may be true, and I am no bleeding heart; but movies should not always reinforce the obvious. One of the more positive aspects of the movie was seeing the Tidwell's as a normal and married black couple rather than bickering losers having illegitimate offspring. You could see Crowe's sensitivity and trying to elevate the dialogue without being soppy. I think what made this movie so zeitgeist was that it captured and incorporated the rampant and materialism of the 1990s. This decade was more greedy than the 80s because suddenly actors and athletes had the fattest paychecks simply for being entertainers. They suddenly became royalty. This decade was the beginning of the endorsement culture that blew up in the 2000s. The general public truly believed that bigger was better and resented being told otherwise. SUV's, designer clothes, limitless credit cards, supersized meals and Venti sized coffee's were almost a requirement. If you want to see a well acted film you will not be disappointed. I recommend looking at the movie with a grain of salt and detaching oneself from the underlying capitalist and elitist message that it sends.

    I like Tom Cruise, he plays Tom Cruise really well, and this is no different. Jerry Maguire is a Sports Agent who after an epiphany of conscience sets up on his own. That's when Renee Zellweger brings the unlikely into the plot. Everything apart from Jerry's relationship with Dorothy in this film is plausible. Bonnie Hunt (always a good bet) plays the sensible sister whom Dorothy could listen to once in a while. Sure it plays out in true Hollywood fashion - yay - but I get angry at characters like Dorothy Boyd, annoying and silly. Tom is great, Jay Mohr (Sugar, the rival agent) plays sleaze so well, Cuba Gooding Jnr's flamboyant extrovert over-the-top manic is perfect for his role as Rod Tidwell and he really brings some crazy sanity to the other side of the plot which is the schmaltz of Jerry and Dorothy and corny dialogue. His relationship with Jerry is heartwarming, and the bromance between them is the real love interest of the film. Regina King is great as Mrs Tidwell, although I've only seen her play similar roles. Jerry Maquire is rightly hailed as a modern classic film, and whilst I find the romance between Dorothy and Jerry a little ridiculous and far-fetched, it does make it appeal to a wider audience that would other wise be only sports fans. It makes the film cover more genres, makes it different to other sports-films by giving it a number of story threads. Whilst it is predictable and has a very Hollywood ending, you don't really mind as it rounds the package of this film off nicely and it wouldn't have worked so well any other way. Special mention in this film has to go to little Jonathan Lipnicki who plays Dorothy (Renee's) son Ray; he's as cute as a button and adds some rather natural acting for one so young (age 5) as the child who melts Jerry a little bit. Overall, a great movie you can watch over and over, and one of Tom's best roles.

    You can tell after watching Jerry Maguire that this movie isn't in it for just some quick money. The movie has a lot of heart and a great sense of humor to back it up. The story is simple enough, a sports agent loses his job and is desperately trying to keep his head above water in the sports business. He falls in love along the way and it turns into a love story. This movie has a great cast including a Tom Cruise who is wonderful in it. Cruise straddles the line between desperate and crazy with Jerry Maguire and in the process delivers some hilarious scenes (SHOW ME THE MONEY). Cuba Gooding Jr. is strong throughout (as he and Maguire are almost equals in their life situation). The film manages to not go to melodramatic and keep the comedy coming. For me, the whole movie is made by Tom Cruise. In particular, I find his reactions hilarious. The firing sequence along with his facial expressions when answering the devastating phone-call in Cushman's apartment are prime examples of Cruise's greatness in this movie. If you want a flick that is smart and witty but also offers up an engaging love-story and interesting plot, look no further than Jerry Maguire.

    Tom Cruise plays a big time professional Agent signing the big names. supposedly it's loosely based on a major professional real life agent. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a highly skilled football player who just wants to get paid,, hence the phrase and catchline... "Show me the Money". or as Prime Time Deion Sanders would say,,, Pay the Man.. this is a story about how much our sports agent will take and go thru to make his clients happy,, it seems he will have to sell his soul in order to please them,, he decides that working for the agency he's had enough,, and he starts his own agency and takes a beautiful young helper with him,, together they start up his own business, of him being a free lance agent. he tries to spend time at home, as his job requires him to be away a lot, and it just isn't working out for him,, his client keeps bugging him about his new contract deal,, and wanting to get paid.. this movie takes a look at a different sides of sports... very interesting,, just I think Cruise wasn't up to his usual great performance in this one.

    Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a hotshot sports agent. As such, he wants to get the fattest contracts for his clients because his own salary depends on it. He has a type A girlfriend, Avery (Kelly Preston) and a seemingly great life. But, one day, he has an epiphany. Jerry has seen the tears in the eyes of the children who wonder why Mr. Maguire is still talking money when their father or mother is gravely injured and probably shouldn't play again. Therefore, Jerry pens an open letter to his fellow agents at their huge firm, asking them to follow their hearts and not just the dollar signs. Although everyone initially claps Jer on the back, he is soon dumped. The executioner" (Jay Mohr), a more senior agent, does it in a crowded restaurant where he also announces his plans to "takeover" everyone of Maguire's clients. All too soon it happens. Jerry retains only one athlete, Rod (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an iffy client due to injuries. Cleaning out his desk, Jerry bravely tells the entire office he is opening his own agency and asks someone, anyone to go with him. Only one does. That would be Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), a single mother of one darling son, Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki), who admired greatly the stance he took in his open letter. Yet, for both Jerry and Dorothy, the whole start-up biz is an extreme risk, with only one sure client. Meanwhile, Avery dumps her fianc&eacute; on his ear when he loses the chance to represent a rookie NFL quarterback. Truth is, Jerry's old agency told a bunch of lies to steal this young man away. To complicate matters more, Jerry asks Dorothy out on a date, which goes well. Can romance and infant businesses make a good mix? Will Maguire, who stuck his head out for something good, now have it chopped off in the cruel world of capitalism? This is without a doubt Cruise's most enjoyable flick. Even folks who think they don't care for him will enjoy this one. It doesn't hurt, of course, to have sidekicks in Zellweger, Gooding, Jr., Bonnie Hunt, Mohr, Preston and the darling Lipnicki. Then, too, Cameron Crowe, who wrote and directed this gem, deserves lots of praise as well. To complete the movie's success are great costumes, sets, and photography. Come on, folks, re-runs of The Big Valley are nice but why not snag this film instead if you've never had the pleasure of it?

    Amusing comedy drama that alternates between being a mockery of greed in the sports world and romantic comedy. Tom Cruise, in one of his best roles, plays sports agent Jerry Maguire. He is tired of the cynicism in the sports world. When he gets fired and is starting his own business, it is only two who believe in him to succeed. A secretary (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) and a promising player (Cuba Gooding Jr.) in American football. The questions then become two: Will Jerry Maguire get back together with the secretary, who is a single mother? Is the football player going to become a star? The film was nominated for many awards, including best film, but only Cuba Gooding Jr. won an Oscar, then for Best Supporting Actor. Cameron Crowe's film is filled with so much humor, charm and warmth, that it does not matter that it is a bit predictable.

    "I didn't know it was a romantic comedy." Kristl said. She was leaning back into the couch in the garage turned movie theater,"I was completely fooled by the name and the fact it said someone wrote a statement against greed in sports. I thought it would be a drama in which someone rejects greed. Instead it is just a story vehicle to have two people meet." "I didn't know either. A romantic comedy! The last one I saw was When Harry met Sally. I think that was more than enough romcom to last me a lifetime." Henry laid down the remote. "So what now?" "Maybe we ought to sit it out..You know, can we judge a movie based on the first thirty minutes? Although it has Tom Cruise in it. A romantic comedy with Tom Cruise. That is so wrong." "And no action. And Renee Zellweger..the girl that looks like she is perpetually on the verge of a nervous breakdown and about to cry. I think she can't really act, just plays one person called Renee Zellweger with one facial expression." "She does it very well though. But Tom Cruise as an love interest. Horrible. I can't see him as a nice man in this movie, but as a sleek guy with a fake smile... but most of all, his cold eyes.. Brr." Kristl shivered, "But he was great in movies like Born on the Fourth of July, or Rain Man or Collateral." "To be fair we ought to watch a movie with Tom Cruise at his best. A movie where he kicks ass," Henry said, "Like Mission Impossible." "Beg your pardon?" Kristl raised an eyebrow. "Minority Report then?" "Are you serious?" "The Last Samurai?" "Nope." Kristl shook her head. "What then? Not Rain Man please" "How about Collateral?" "It's a deal."

    Jerry Maguire is what it is because it blends everything it has to begin with, with talented writing and phenomenal performances from Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. This story at first is in a way, a satire of American sports. Everything from NFL drafts to player's wages, the film exploits everything in between at the very beginning. At first, Jerry Maguire is Tom Cruise. Literally, this is the same character that Cruise has played in every film since Risky Business. However, you really get to know the character and feel great sympathy for him. He certainly did not deserve everything to happen to him, and you really get a great sense of his peers as well. Is this really what it is, or more like, is this really how it is? Either way this is the best performance of Tom Cruise's career hands-down. Cuba Gooding Jr is the real star of the show. He deserved his best supporting actor Oscar as much as Cruise deserved his best actor. The two work well off each other, and you really anticipate the next time they are on screen together. The film slowly evolves into a love story, not only between Cruise and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, but the bond between Cruise and Cuba. This is a film that works, every cheesy but quotable line, every chuckle from Cuba Gooding Jr being an outlandish diva and every time you realize that this is a film that is much deeper than what you may have thought. Go see it.

    Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a hotshot sports agent. As such, he wants to get the fattest contracts for his clients because his own salary depends on it. He has a type A girlfriend, Avery (Kelly Preston) and a seemingly great life. But, one day, he has an epiphany. Jerry has seen the tears in the eyes of the children who wonder why Mr. Maguire is still talking money when their father or mother is gravely injured and probably shouldn't play again. Therefore, Jerry pens an open letter to his fellow agents at their huge firm, asking them to follow their hearts and not just the dollar signs. Although everyone initially claps Jer on the back, he is soon dumped. The executioner" (Jay Mohr), a more senior agent, does it in a crowded restaurant where he also announces his plans to "takeover" everyone of Maguire's clients. All too soon it happens. Jerry retains only one athlete, Rod (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an iffy client due to injuries. Cleaning out his desk, Jerry bravely tells the entire office he is opening his own agency and asks someone, anyone to go with him. Only one does. That would be Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), a single mother of one darling son, Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki), who admired greatly the stance he took in his open letter. Yet, for both Jerry and Dorothy, the whole start-up biz is an extreme risk, with only one sure client. Meanwhile, Avery dumps her fianc&eacute; on his ear when he loses the chance to represent a rookie NFL quarterback. Truth is, Jerry's old agency told a bunch of lies to steal this young man away. To complicate matters more, Jerry asks Dorothy out on a date, which goes well. Can romance and infant businesses make a good mix? Will Maguire, who stuck his head out for something good, now have it chopped off in the cruel world of capitalism? This is without a doubt Cruise's most enjoyable flick. Even folks who think they don't care for him will enjoy this one. It doesn't hurt, of course, to have sidekicks in Zellweger, Gooding, Jr., Bonnie Hunt, Mohr, Preston and the darling Lipnicki. Then, too, Cameron Crowe, who wrote and directed this gem, deserves lots of praise as well. To complete the movie's success are great costumes, sets, and photography. Come on, folks, re-runs of The Big Valley are nice but why not snag this film instead if you've never had the pleasure of it?

    Amusing comedy drama that alternates between being a mockery of greed in the sports world and romantic comedy. Tom Cruise, in one of his best roles, plays sports agent Jerry Maguire. He is tired of the cynicism in the sports world. When he gets fired and is starting his own business, it is only two who believe in him to succeed. A secretary (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) and a promising player (Cuba Gooding Jr.) in American football. The questions then become two: Will Jerry Maguire get back together with the secretary, who is a single mother? Is the football player going to become a star? The film was nominated for many awards, including best film, but only Cuba Gooding Jr. won an Oscar, then for Best Supporting Actor. Cameron Crowe's film is filled with so much humor, charm and warmth, that it does not matter that it is a bit predictable.

    "I didn't know it was a romantic comedy." Kristl said. She was leaning back into the couch in the garage turned movie theater,"I was completely fooled by the name and the fact it said someone wrote a statement against greed in sports. I thought it would be a drama in which someone rejects greed. Instead it is just a story vehicle to have two people meet." "I didn't know either. A romantic comedy! The last one I saw was When Harry met Sally. I think that was more than enough romcom to last me a lifetime." Henry laid down the remote. "So what now?" "Maybe we ought to sit it out..You know, can we judge a movie based on the first thirty minutes? Although it has Tom Cruise in it. A romantic comedy with Tom Cruise. That is so wrong." "And no action. And Renee Zellweger..the girl that looks like she is perpetually on the verge of a nervous breakdown and about to cry. I think she can't really act, just plays one person called Renee Zellweger with one facial expression." "She does it very well though. But Tom Cruise as an love interest. Horrible. I can't see him as a nice man in this movie, but as a sleek guy with a fake smile... but most of all, his cold eyes.. Brr." Kristl shivered, "But he was great in movies like Born on the Fourth of July, or Rain Man or Collateral." "To be fair we ought to watch a movie with Tom Cruise at his best. A movie where he kicks ass," Henry said, "Like Mission Impossible." "Beg your pardon?" Kristl raised an eyebrow. "Minority Report then?" "Are you serious?" "The Last Samurai?" "Nope." Kristl shook her head. "What then? Not Rain Man please" "How about Collateral?" "It's a deal."

    Jerry Maguire is what it is because it blends everything it has to begin with, with talented writing and phenomenal performances from Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. This story at first is in a way, a satire of American sports. Everything from NFL drafts to player's wages, the film exploits everything in between at the very beginning. At first, Jerry Maguire is Tom Cruise. Literally, this is the same character that Cruise has played in every film since Risky Business. However, you really get to know the character and feel great sympathy for him. He certainly did not deserve everything to happen to him, and you really get a great sense of his peers as well. Is this really what it is, or more like, is this really how it is? Either way this is the best performance of Tom Cruise's career hands-down. Cuba Gooding Jr is the real star of the show. He deserved his best supporting actor Oscar as much as Cruise deserved his best actor. The two work well off each other, and you really anticipate the next time they are on screen together. The film slowly evolves into a love story, not only between Cruise and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, but the bond between Cruise and Cuba. This is a film that works, every cheesy but quotable line, every chuckle from Cuba Gooding Jr being an outlandish diva and every time you realize that this is a film that is much deeper than what you may have thought. Go see it.

    Jerry Maguire is now pop culture reference material. "You had me at Hello" and "You complete me" are some of the most commonly quoted movie phrase in North America. Underneath that is a romance born of unusual circumstances. The good. Very interesting story with a unique setup. Well paced scenario. Excellent character psychology and interactions. The actors. Tom Cruise goes all out, but his best scenes are the ones where he's calm. Cuba Gooding Jr. is just spot on as the self-centered athlete. And Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is at her cutest and most vulnerable as the lost single mother. The bad. Acting exaggerations on the part of Cruise and Gooding. It's probably what made it popular in the first place, but watching it now, for the third time, it's unnerving. Also, the kid might have been cute the first time you see the flick, but he's really not a good child actor. The ugly. Quarterback Troy Aikman shows once again that professional athlete can't act to save their lives. It's a good thing he's got only two lines. The result. Very good entertainment for the romantics with a bit of sport thrown in the mix.

    This is a Tom Cruise movie, but I did not hold that against it. For some reason I wanted to see this movie, not because it was a Tom Cruise movie, but because of the plot about how the main character, Jerry Maguire, lost his job as a sports agent and then went out on his own to build up his empire again. The plot is not that shallow, rather the character of Maguire begins as a business orientated, money loving, sports agent until he is confronted with the reality of his character through the hatred of the son of a badly injured ice hockey player. At this point he realises that his desire is to purely make money off of other people and that he does not care about the person whom he is making money off. At that point he writes a mission statement which he intends to change the whole industry with - and even though he is congratulated with his stand, the competitiveness of the industry means that the younger agents seize this moment of weakness and throw him out. In the ensuing struggle he manages to gain two stars to work for, and then the famous one walks out on him leaving his with an angry black football player who wants a great contract but is not willing to work for it. Through the movie we see Maguire's character struggle through his problems, and his character rely on what are defined as his weaknesses. At the bachelor party at the beginning his one major weakness is revealed: he needs a woman to support him - he cannot be alone. So when he looses his job, he also walks out on his star fianc&eacute;e because he simply feels that he does not deserve her. He has lost everything else so by all intents and purposes, he should loose her as well. This is where the other character comes in. An accountant at the firm Maguire worked for who was inspired by his mission statement. When Maguire calls for people to leave with him, she is the only one who does, but she also has a desire - she wants an husband and a father for her child. This is strengthened through the movie as she continues to look at people in love and think about how she wants that for himself. This is bad because Maguire can't be alone, and she knows that, so she sees her chance and takes him. The thing that makes this a little different is that Maguire loves her kid. This weakness of Maguire's is continually exploited as he struggles with his single client, who is so stubborn that he refuses to leave Maquire, but he also refuses to listen to Maguire's advice. In the end they must settle with a weak contract because there is little else that they can get. It is only when he breaks out of his shell that things start to happen, and because Maguire has been his friend as well as his agent, this relationship is strengthened. But his character is also there to show what a strong marriage relationship is all about. As we watch Maguire and his secretary romanticise over each other, we know that it is not a relationship of love, but one of necessity. When they do get married, we know that it is because Maguire simply does not want her to leave as opposed to really loving her. The illusionary relationship is developed as it is contrasted with that of Maguire's client. We see a husband and wife who truly love each other, while Maguire and his wife seem to drift apart as Maguire spends more time with his client and his son. This is a great movie, and it is surprisingly deep for an American movie. The characters are finely crafted and they each have to struggle through their problems, all of them looking for the easy way out but knowing that it is not the best way out. For a Tom Cruise movie, it is actually quite good.

    I will try to not parrot what has already been said about the movie, for better or worse. I have nothing against the actors of the feature film. They were the best of the best in that genre and generation. My issue is with all the product placement and overall marketing that the film is bombarded with ranging from Reebok, Apple Jacks, NFL and I don't know how many other products. If one is not discerning, one can fall for it and feel like ESPN is the ultimate authority in sports and that the NFL is the best thing that there is. I won't question the integrity of these entities because that's not what this review is about. The cameos from real life corporate executives further reinforced the marketing at play her. I just think that it would have felt more artistic and original to have come up with a pretend organization resembling the ones mentioned so that the viewer is not resold on the idea that big corporations truly benefit humanity and actually constitute a culture. For a movie about redemption and love, there is the underlying message that money and materialism is the agent that facilitates can destroy and redeem you. This may be true, and I am no bleeding heart; but movies should not always reinforce the obvious. One of the more positive aspects of the movie was seeing the Tidwell's as a normal and married black couple rather than bickering losers having illegitimate offspring. You could see Crowe's sensitivity and trying to elevate the dialogue without being soppy. I think what made this movie so zeitgeist was that it captured and incorporated the rampant and materialism of the 1990s. This decade was more greedy than the 80s because suddenly actors and athletes had the fattest paychecks simply for being entertainers. They suddenly became royalty. This decade was the beginning of the endorsement culture that blew up in the 2000s. The general public truly believed that bigger was better and resented being told otherwise. SUV's, designer clothes, limitless credit cards, supersized meals and Venti sized coffee's were almost a requirement. If you want to see a well acted film you will not be disappointed. I recommend looking at the movie with a grain of salt and detaching oneself from the underlying capitalist and elitist message that it sends.

    I like Tom Cruise, he plays Tom Cruise really well, and this is no different. Jerry Maguire is a Sports Agent who after an epiphany of conscience sets up on his own. That's when Renee Zellweger brings the unlikely into the plot. Everything apart from Jerry's relationship with Dorothy in this film is plausible. Bonnie Hunt (always a good bet) plays the sensible sister whom Dorothy could listen to once in a while. Sure it plays out in true Hollywood fashion - yay - but I get angry at characters like Dorothy Boyd, annoying and silly. Tom is great, Jay Mohr (Sugar, the rival agent) plays sleaze so well, Cuba Gooding Jnr's flamboyant extrovert over-the-top manic is perfect for his role as Rod Tidwell and he really brings some crazy sanity to the other side of the plot which is the schmaltz of Jerry and Dorothy and corny dialogue. His relationship with Jerry is heartwarming, and the bromance between them is the real love interest of the film. Regina King is great as Mrs Tidwell, although I've only seen her play similar roles. Jerry Maquire is rightly hailed as a modern classic film, and whilst I find the romance between Dorothy and Jerry a little ridiculous and far-fetched, it does make it appeal to a wider audience that would other wise be only sports fans. It makes the film cover more genres, makes it different to other sports-films by giving it a number of story threads. Whilst it is predictable and has a very Hollywood ending, you don't really mind as it rounds the package of this film off nicely and it wouldn't have worked so well any other way. Special mention in this film has to go to little Jonathan Lipnicki who plays Dorothy (Renee's) son Ray; he's as cute as a button and adds some rather natural acting for one so young (age 5) as the child who melts Jerry a little bit. Overall, a great movie you can watch over and over, and one of Tom's best roles.

    You can tell after watching Jerry Maguire that this movie isn't in it for just some quick money. The movie has a lot of heart and a great sense of humor to back it up. The story is simple enough, a sports agent loses his job and is desperately trying to keep his head above water in the sports business. He falls in love along the way and it turns into a love story. This movie has a great cast including a Tom Cruise who is wonderful in it. Cruise straddles the line between desperate and crazy with Jerry Maguire and in the process delivers some hilarious scenes (SHOW ME THE MONEY). Cuba Gooding Jr. is strong throughout (as he and Maguire are almost equals in their life situation). The film manages to not go to melodramatic and keep the comedy coming. For me, the whole movie is made by Tom Cruise. In particular, I find his reactions hilarious. The firing sequence along with his facial expressions when answering the devastating phone-call in Cushman's apartment are prime examples of Cruise's greatness in this movie. If you want a flick that is smart and witty but also offers up an engaging love-story and interesting plot, look no further than Jerry Maguire.

    Tom Cruise plays a big time professional Agent signing the big names. supposedly it's loosely based on a major professional real life agent. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a highly skilled football player who just wants to get paid,, hence the phrase and catchline... "Show me the Money". or as Prime Time Deion Sanders would say,,, Pay the Man.. this is a story about how much our sports agent will take and go thru to make his clients happy,, it seems he will have to sell his soul in order to please them,, he decides that working for the agency he's had enough,, and he starts his own agency and takes a beautiful young helper with him,, together they start up his own business, of him being a free lance agent. he tries to spend time at home, as his job requires him to be away a lot, and it just isn't working out for him,, his client keeps bugging him about his new contract deal,, and wanting to get paid.. this movie takes a look at a different sides of sports... very interesting,, just I think Cruise wasn't up to his usual great performance in this one.

    This is a Tom Cruise movie, but I did not hold that against it. For some reason I wanted to see this movie, not because it was a Tom Cruise movie, but because of the plot about how the main character, Jerry Maguire, lost his job as a sports agent and then went out on his own to build up his empire again. The plot is not that shallow, rather the character of Maguire begins as a business orientated, money loving, sports agent until he is confronted with the reality of his character through the hatred of the son of a badly injured ice hockey player. At this point he realises that his desire is to purely make money off of other people and that he does not care about the person whom he is making money off.

In the ensuing struggle he manages to gain two stars to work for, and then the famous one walks out on him leaving his with an angry black football player who wants a great contract but is not willing to work for it. Through the movie we see Maguire's character struggle through his problems, and his character rely on what are defined as his weaknesses. At the bachelor party at the beginning his one major weakness is revealed: he needs a woman to support him - he cannot be alone. So when he looses his job, he also walks out on his star fianc&eacute;e because he simply feels that he does not deserve her. He has lost everything else so by all intents and purposes, he should loose her as well. This is where the other character comes in. An accountant at the firm Maguire worked for who was inspired by his mission statement. When Maguire calls for people to leave with him, she is the only one who does, but she also has a desire - she wants an husband and a father for her child. This is strengthened through the movie as she continues to look at people in love and think about how she wants that for himself. This is bad because Maguire can't be alone, and she knows that, so she sees her chance and takes him. The thing that makes this a little different is that Maguire loves her kid.

It is only when he breaks out of his shell that things start to happen, and because Maguire has been his friend as well as his agent, this relationship is strengthened. But his character is also there to show what a strong marriage relationship is all about. As we watch Maguire and his secretary romanticise over each other, we know that it is not a relationship of love, but one of necessity. When they do get married, we know that it is because Maguire simply does not want her to leave as opposed to really loving her. The illusionary relationship is developed as it is contrasted with that of Maguire's client. We see a husband and wife who truly love each other, while Maguire and his wife seem to drift apart as Maguire spends more time with his client and his son. This is a great movie, and it is surprisingly deep for an American movie. The characters are finely crafted and they each have to struggle through their problems, all of them looking for the easy way out but knowing that it is not the best way out. For a Tom Cruise movie, it is actually quite good.

    I will try to not parrot what has already been said about the movie, for better or worse. I have nothing against the actors of the feature film. They were the best of the best in that genre and generation. My issue is with all the product placement and overall marketing that the film is bombarded with ranging from Reebok, Apple Jacks, NFL and I don't know how many other products. If one is not discerning, one can fall for it and feel like ESPN is the ultimate authority in sports and that the NFL is the best thing that there is. I won't question the integrity of these entities because that's not what this review is about. The cameos from real life corporate executives further reinforced the marketing at play her. I just think that it would have felt more artistic and original to have come up with a pretend organization resembling the ones mentioned so that the viewer is not resold on the idea that big corporations truly benefit humanity and actually constitute a culture. For a movie about redemption and love, there is the underlying message that money and materialism is the agent that facilitates can destroy and redeem you. This may be true, and I am no bleeding heart; but movies should not always reinforce the obvious. One of the more positive aspects of the movie was seeing the Tidwell's as a normal and married black couple rather than bickering losers having illegitimate offspring. You could see Crowe's sensitivity and trying to elevate the dialogue without being soppy. I think what made this movie so zeitgeist was that it captured and incorporated the rampant and materialism of the 1990s. This decade was more greedy than the 80s because suddenly actors and athletes had the fattest paychecks simply for being entertainers. They suddenly became royalty. This decade was the beginning of the endorsement culture that blew up in the 2000s. The general public truly believed that bigger was better and resented being told otherwise. SUV's, designer clothes, limitless credit cards, supersized meals and Venti sized coffee's were almost a requirement. If you want to see a well acted film you will not be disappointed. I recommend looking at the movie with a grain of salt and detaching oneself from the underlying capitalist and elitist message that it sends.

    I like Tom Cruise, he plays Tom Cruise really well, and this is no different. Jerry Maguire is a Sports Agent who after an epiphany of conscience sets up on his own. That's when Renee Zellweger brings the unlikely into the plot. Everything apart from Jerry's relationship with Dorothy in this film is plausible. Bonnie Hunt (always a good bet) plays the sensible sister whom Dorothy could listen to once in a while. Sure it plays out in true Hollywood fashion - yay - but I get angry at characters like Dorothy Boyd, annoying and silly. Tom is great, Jay Mohr (Sugar, the rival agent) plays sleaze so well, Cuba Gooding Jnr's flamboyant extrovert over-the-top manic is perfect for his role as Rod Tidwell and he really brings some crazy sanity to the other side of the plot which is the schmaltz of Jerry and Dorothy and corny dialogue. His relationship with Jerry is heartwarming, and the bromance between them is the real love interest of the film. Regina King is great as Mrs Tidwell, although I've only seen her play similar roles. Jerry Maquire is rightly hailed as a modern classic film, and whilst I find the romance between Dorothy and Jerry a little ridiculous and far-fetched, it does make it appeal to a wider audience that would other wise be only sports fans. It makes the film cover more genres, makes it different to other sports-films by giving it a number of story threads. Whilst it is predictable and has a very Hollywood ending, you don't really mind as it rounds the package of this film off nicely and it wouldn't have worked so well any other way. Special mention in this film has to go to little Jonathan Lipnicki who plays Dorothy (Renee's) son Ray; he's as cute as a button and adds some rather natural acting for one so young (age 5) as the child who melts Jerry a little bit. Overall, a great movie you can watch over and over, and one of Tom's best roles.

    You can tell after watching Jerry Maguire that this movie isn't in it for just some quick money. The movie has a lot of heart and a great sense of humor to back it up. The story is simple enough, a sports agent loses his job and is desperately trying to keep his head above water in the sports business. He falls in love along the way and it turns into a love story. This movie has a great cast including a Tom Cruise who is wonderful in it. Cruise straddles the line between desperate and crazy with Jerry Maguire and in the process delivers some hilarious scenes (SHOW ME THE MONEY). Cuba Gooding Jr. is strong throughout (as he and Maguire are almost equals in their life situation). The film manages to not go to melodramatic and keep the comedy coming. For me, the whole movie is made by Tom Cruise. In particular, I find his reactions hilarious. The firing sequence along with his facial expressions when answering the devastating phone-call in Cushman's apartment are prime examples of Cruise's greatness in this movie. If you want a flick that is smart and witty but also offers up an engaging love-story and interesting plot, look no further than Jerry Maguire.

    Tom Cruise plays a big time professional Agent signing the big names. supposedly it's loosely based on a major professional real life agent. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a highly skilled football player who just wants to get paid,, hence the phrase and catchline... "Show me the Money". or as Prime Time Deion Sanders would say,,, Pay the Man.. this is a story about how much our sports agent will take and go thru to make his clients happy,, it seems he will have to sell his soul in order to please them,, he decides that working for the agency he's had enough,, and he starts his own agency and takes a beautiful young helper with him,, together they start up his own business, of him being a free lance agent. he tries to spend time at home, as his job requires him to be away a lot, and it just isn't working out for him,, his client keeps bugging him about his new contract deal,, and wanting to get paid.. this movie takes a look at a different sides of sports... very interesting,, just I think Cruise wasn't up to his usual great performance in this one.

    Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a hotshot sports agent. As such, he wants to get the fattest contracts for his clients because his own salary depends on it. He has a type A girlfriend, Avery (Kelly Preston) and a seemingly great life. But, one day, he has an epiphany. Jerry has seen the tears in the eyes of the children who wonder why Mr. Maguire is still talking money when their father or mother is gravely injured and probably shouldn't play again. Therefore, Jerry pens an open letter to his fellow agents at their huge firm, asking them to follow their hearts and not just the dollar signs. Although everyone initially claps Jer on the back, he is soon dumped. The executioner" (Jay Mohr), a more senior agent, does it in a crowded restaurant where he also announces his plans to "takeover" everyone of Maguire's clients. All too soon it happens. Jerry retains only one athlete, Rod (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an iffy client due to injuries. Cleaning out his desk, Jerry bravely tells the entire office he is opening his own agency and asks someone, anyone to go with him. Only one does. That would be Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), a single mother of one darling son, Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki), who admired greatly the stance he took in his open letter. Yet, for both Jerry and Dorothy, the whole start-up biz is an extreme risk, with only one sure client. Meanwhile, Avery dumps her fianc&eacute; on his ear when he loses the chance to represent a rookie NFL quarterback. Truth is, Jerry's old agency told a bunch of lies to steal this young man away. To complicate matters more, Jerry asks Dorothy out on a date, which goes well. Can romance and infant businesses make a good mix? Will Maguire, who stuck his head out for something good, now have it chopped off in the cruel world of capitalism? This is without a doubt Cruise's most enjoyable flick. Even folks who think they don't care for him will enjoy this one. It doesn't hurt, of course, to have sidekicks in Zellweger, Gooding, Jr., Bonnie Hunt, Mohr, Preston and the darling Lipnicki. Then, too, Cameron Crowe, who wrote and directed this gem, deserves lots of praise as well. To complete the movie's success are great costumes, sets, and photography. Come on, folks, re-runs of The Big Valley are nice but why not snag this film instead if you've never had the pleasure of it?

    Amusing comedy drama that alternates between being a mockery of greed in the sports world and romantic comedy. Tom Cruise, in one of his best roles, plays sports agent Jerry Maguire. He is tired of the cynicism in the sports world. When he gets fired and is starting his own business, it is only two who believe in him to succeed. A secretary (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) and a promising player (Cuba Gooding Jr.) in American football. The questions then become two: Will Jerry Maguire get back together with the secretary, who is a single mother? Is the football player going to become a star? The film was nominated for many awards, including best film, but only Cuba Gooding Jr. won an Oscar, then for Best Supporting Actor. Cameron Crowe's film is filled with so much humor, charm and warmth, that it does not matter that it is a bit predictable.

    "I didn't know it was a romantic comedy." Kristl said. She was leaning back into the couch in the garage turned movie theater,"I was completely fooled by the name and the fact it said someone wrote a statement against greed in sports. I thought it would be a drama in which someone rejects greed. Instead it is just a story vehicle to have two people meet." "I didn't know either. A romantic comedy! The last one I saw was When Harry met Sally. I think that was more than enough romcom to last me a lifetime." Henry laid down the remote. "So what now?" "Maybe we ought to sit it out..You know, can we judge a movie based on the first thirty minutes? Although it has Tom Cruise in it. A romantic comedy with Tom Cruise. That is so wrong." "And no action. And Renee Zellweger..the girl that looks like she is perpetually on the verge of a nervous breakdown and about to cry. I think she can't really act, just plays one person called Renee Zellweger with one facial expression." "She does it very well though. But Tom Cruise as an love interest. Horrible. I can't see him as a nice man in this movie, but as a sleek guy with a fake smile... but most of all, his cold eyes.. Brr." Kristl shivered, "But he was great in movies like Born on the Fourth of July, or Rain Man or Collateral." "To be fair we ought to watch a movie with Tom Cruise at his best. A movie where he kicks ass," Henry said, "Like Mission Impossible." "Beg your pardon?" Kristl raised an eyebrow. "Minority Report then?" "Are you serious?" "The Last Samurai?" "Nope." Kristl shook her head. "What then? Not Rain Man please" "How about Collateral?" "It's a deal."

    Jerry Maguire is what it is because it blends everything it has to begin with, with talented writing and phenomenal performances from Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. This story at first is in a way, a satire of American sports. Everything from NFL drafts to player's wages, the film exploits everything in between at the very beginning. At first, Jerry Maguire is Tom Cruise. Literally, this is the same character that Cruise has played in every film since Risky Business. However, you really get to know the character and feel great sympathy for him. He certainly did not deserve everything to happen to him, and you really get a great sense of his peers as well. Is this really what it is, or more like, is this really how it is? Either way this is the best performance of Tom Cruise's career hands-down. Cuba Gooding Jr is the real star of the show. He deserved his best supporting actor Oscar as much as Cruise deserved his best actor. The two work well off each other, and you really anticipate the next time they are on screen together. The film slowly evolves into a love story, not only between Cruise and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, but the bond between Cruise and Cuba. This is a film that works, every cheesy but quotable line, every chuckle from Cuba Gooding Jr being an outlandish diva and every time you realize that this is a film that is much deeper than what you may have thought. Go see it.

    Jerry Maguire is now pop culture reference material. "You had me at Hello" and "You complete me" are some of the most commonly quoted movie phrase in North America. Underneath that is a romance born of unusual circumstances. The good. Very interesting story with a unique setup. Well paced scenario. Excellent character psychology and interactions. The actors. Tom Cruise goes all out, but his best scenes are the ones where he's calm. Cuba Gooding Jr. is just spot on as the self-centered athlete. And Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is at her cutest and most vulnerable as the lost single mother. The bad. Acting exaggerations on the part of Cruise and Gooding. It's probably what made it popular in the first place, but watching it now, for the third time, it's unnerving. Also, the kid might have been cute the first time you see the flick, but he's really not a good child actor. The ugly. Quarterback Troy Aikman shows once again that professional athlete can't act to save their lives. It's a good thing he's got only two lines. The result. Very good entertainment for the romantics with a bit of sport thrown in the mix.

    This is a Tom Cruise movie, but I did not hold that against it. For some reason I wanted to see this movie, not because it was a Tom Cruise movie, but because of the plot about how the main character, Jerry Maguire, lost his job as a sports agent and then went out on his own to build up his empire again. The plot is not that shallow, rather the character of Maguire begins as a business orientated, money loving, sports agent until he is confronted with the reality of his character through the hatred of the son of a badly injured ice hockey player. At this point he realises that his desire is to purely make money off of other people and that he does not care about the person whom he is making money off. At that point he writes a mission statement which he intends to change the whole industry with - and even though he is congratulated with his stand, the competitiveness of the industry means that the younger agents seize this moment of weakness and throw him out. In the ensuing struggle he manages to gain two stars to work for, and then the famous one walks out on him leaving his with an angry black football player who wants a great contract but is not willing to work for it. Through the movie we see Maguire's character struggle through his problems, and his character rely on what are defined as his weaknesses. At the bachelor party at the beginning his one major weakness is revealed: he needs a woman to support him - he cannot be alone. So when he looses his job, he also walks out on his star fianc&eacute;e because he simply feels that he does not deserve her. He has lost everything else so by all intents and purposes, he should loose her as well. This is where the other character comes in. An accountant at the firm Maguire worked for who was inspired by his mission statement. When Maguire calls for people to leave with him, she is the only one who does, but she also has a desire - she wants an husband and a father for her child. This is strengthened through the movie as she continues to look at people in love and think about how she wants that for himself. This is bad because Maguire can't be alone, and she knows that, so she sees her chance and takes him. The thing that makes this a little different is that Maguire loves her kid. This weakness of Maguire's is continually exploited as he struggles with his single client, who is so stubborn that he refuses to leave Maquire, but he also refuses to listen to Maguire's advice. In the end they must settle with a weak contract because there is little else that they can get. It is only when he breaks out of his shell that things start to happen, and because Maguire has been his friend as well as his agent, this relationship is strengthened. But his character is also there to show what a strong marriage relationship is all about. As we watch Maguire and his secretary romanticise over each other, we know that it is not a relationship of love, but one of necessity. When they do get married, we know that it is because Maguire simply does not want her to leave as opposed to really loving her. The illusionary relationship is developed as it is contrasted with that of Maguire's client. We see a husband and wife who truly love each other, while Maguire and his wife seem to drift apart as Maguire spends more time with his client and his son. This is a great movie, and it is surprisingly deep for an American movie. The characters are finely crafted and they each have to struggle through their problems, all of them looking for the easy way out but knowing that it is not the best way out. For a Tom Cruise movie, it is actually quite good.

    "I didn't know it was a romantic comedy." Kristl said. She was leaning back into the couch in the garage turned movie theater,"I was completely fooled by the name and the fact it said someone wrote a statement against greed in sports. I thought it would be a drama in which someone rejects greed. Instead it is just a story vehicle to have two people meet." "I didn't know either. A romantic comedy! The last one I saw was When Harry met Sally. I think that was more than enough romcom to last me a lifetime." Henry laid down the remote. "So what now?" "Maybe we ought to sit it out..You know, can we judge a movie based on the first thirty minutes? Although it has Tom Cruise in it. A romantic comedy with Tom Cruise. That is so wrong." "And no action. And Renee Zellweger..the girl that looks like she is perpetually on the verge of a nervous breakdown and about to cry. I think she can't really act, just plays one person called Renee Zellweger with one facial expression." "She does it very well though. But Tom Cruise as an love interest. Horrible. I can't see him as a nice man in this movie, but as a sleek guy with a fake smile... but most of all, his cold eyes.. Brr." Kristl shivered, "But he was great in movies like Born on the Fourth of July, or Rain Man or Collateral." "To be fair we ought to watch a movie with Tom Cruise at his best. A movie where he kicks ass," Henry said, "Like Mission Impossible." "Beg your pardon?" Kristl raised an eyebrow. "Minority Report then?" "Are you serious?" "The Last Samurai?" "Nope." Kristl shook her head. "What then? Not Rain Man please" "How about Collateral?" "It's a deal."

    Jerry Maguire is what it is because it blends everything it has to begin with, with talented writing and phenomenal performances from Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. This story at first is in a way, a satire of American sports. Everything from NFL drafts to player's wages, the film exploits everything in between at the very beginning. At first, Jerry Maguire is Tom Cruise. Literally, this is the same character that Cruise has played in every film since Risky Business. However, you really get to know the character and feel great sympathy for him. He certainly did not deserve everything to happen to him, and you really get a great sense of his peers as well. Is this really what it is, or more like, is this really how it is? Either way this is the best performance of Tom Cruise's career hands-down. Cuba Gooding Jr is the real star of the show. He deserved his best supporting actor Oscar as much as Cruise deserved his best actor. The two work well off each other, and you really anticipate the next time they are on screen together. The film slowly evolves into a love story, not only between Cruise and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, but the bond between Cruise and Cuba. This is a film that works, every cheesy but quotable line, every chuckle from Cuba Gooding Jr being an outlandish diva and every time you realize that this is a film that is much deeper than what you may have thought. Go see it.

    Jerry Maguire is now pop culture reference material. "You had me at Hello" and "You complete me" are some of the most commonly quoted movie phrase in North America. Underneath that is a romance born of unusual circumstances. The good. Very interesting story with a unique setup. Well paced scenario. Excellent character psychology and interactions. The actors. Tom Cruise goes all out, but his best scenes are the ones where he's calm. Cuba Gooding Jr. is just spot on as the self-centered athlete. And Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is at her cutest and most vulnerable as the lost single mother. The bad. Acting exaggerations on the part of Cruise and Gooding. It's probably what made it popular in the first place, but watching it now, for the third time, it's unnerving. Also, the kid might have been cute the first time you see the flick, but he's really not a good child actor. The ugly. Quarterback Troy Aikman shows once again that professional athlete can't act to save their lives. It's a good thing he's got only two lines. The result. Very good entertainment for the romantics with a bit of sport thrown in the mix.

    This is a Tom Cruise movie, but I did not hold that against it. For some reason I wanted to see this movie, not because it was a Tom Cruise movie, but because of the plot about how the main character, Jerry Maguire, lost his job as a sports agent and then went out on his own to build up his empire again. The plot is not that shallow, rather the character of Maguire begins as a business orientated, money loving, sports agent until he is confronted with the reality of his character through the hatred of the son of a badly injured ice hockey player. At this point he realises that his desire is to purely make money off of other people and that he does not care about the person whom he is making money off. At that point he writes a mission statement which he intends to change the whole industry with - and even though he is congratulated with his stand, the competitiveness of the industry means that the younger agents seize this moment of weakness and throw him out. In the ensuing struggle he manages to gain two stars to work for, and then the famous one walks out on him leaving his with an angry black football player who wants a great contract but is not willing to work for it. Through the movie we see Maguire's character struggle through his problems, and his character rely on what are defined as his weaknesses. At the bachelor party at the beginning his one major weakness is revealed: he needs a woman to support him - he cannot be alone. So when he looses his job, he also walks out on his star fianc&eacute;e because he simply feels that he does not deserve her. He has lost everything else so by all intents and purposes, he should loose her as well. This is where the other character comes in. An accountant at the firm Maguire worked for who was inspired by his mission statement. When Maguire calls for people to leave with him, she is the only one who does, but she also has a desire - she wants an husband and a father for her child. This is strengthened through the movie as she continues to look at people in love and think about how she wants that for himself. This is bad because Maguire can't be alone, and she knows that, so she sees her chance and takes him. The thing that makes this a little different is that Maguire loves her kid. This weakness of Maguire's is continually exploited as he struggles with his single client, who is so stubborn that he refuses to leave Maquire, but he also refuses to listen to Maguire's advice. In the end they must settle with a weak contract because there is little else that they can get. It is only when he breaks out of his shell that things start to happen, and because Maguire has been his friend as well as his agent, this relationship is strengthened. But his character is also there to show what a strong marriage relationship is all about. As we watch Maguire and his secretary romanticise over each other, we know that it is not a relationship of love, but one of necessity. When they do get married, we know that it is because Maguire simply does not want her to leave as opposed to really loving her. The illusionary relationship is developed as it is contrasted with that of Maguire's client. We see a husband and wife who truly love each other, while Maguire and his wife seem to drift apart as Maguire spends more time with his client and his son. This is a great movie, and it is surprisingly deep for an American movie. The characters are finely crafted and they each have to struggle through their problems, all of them looking for the easy way out but knowing that it is not the best way out. For a Tom Cruise movie, it is actually quite good.

    I will try to not parrot what has already been said about the movie, for better or worse. I have nothing against the actors of the feature film. They were the best of the best in that genre and generation. My issue is with all the product placement and overall marketing that the film is bombarded with ranging from Reebok, Apple Jacks, NFL and I don't know how many other products. If one is not discerning, one can fall for it and feel like ESPN is the ultimate authority in sports and that the NFL is the best thing that there is. I won't question the integrity of these entities because that's not what this review is about. The cameos from real life corporate executives further reinforced the marketing at play her. I just think that it would have felt more artistic and original to have come up with a pretend organization resembling the ones mentioned so that the viewer is not resold on the idea that big corporations truly benefit humanity and actually constitute a culture. For a movie about redemption and love, there is the underlying message that money and materialism is the agent that facilitates can destroy and redeem you. This may be true, and I am no bleeding heart; but movies should not always reinforce the obvious. One of the more positive aspects of the movie was seeing the Tidwell's as a normal and married black couple rather than bickering losers having illegitimate offspring. You could see Crowe's sensitivity and trying to elevate the dialogue without being soppy. I think what made this movie so zeitgeist was that it captured and incorporated the rampant and materialism of the 1990s. This decade was more greedy than the 80s because suddenly actors and athletes had the fattest paychecks simply for being entertainers. They suddenly became royalty. This decade was the beginning of the endorsement culture that blew up in the 2000s. The general public truly believed that bigger was better and resented being told otherwise. SUV's, designer clothes, limitless credit cards, supersized meals and Venti sized coffee's were almost a requirement. If you want to see a well acted film you will not be disappointed. I recommend looking at the movie with a grain of salt and detaching oneself from the underlying capitalist and elitist message that it sends.

    I like Tom Cruise, he plays Tom Cruise really well, and this is no different. Jerry Maguire is a Sports Agent who after an epiphany of conscience sets up on his own. That's when Renee Zellweger brings the unlikely into the plot. Everything apart from Jerry's relationship with Dorothy in this film is plausible. Bonnie Hunt (always a good bet) plays the sensible sister whom Dorothy could listen to once in a while. Sure it plays out in true Hollywood fashion - yay - but I get angry at characters like Dorothy Boyd, annoying and silly. Tom is great, Jay Mohr (Sugar, the rival agent) plays sleaze so well, Cuba Gooding Jnr's flamboyant extrovert over-the-top manic is perfect for his role as Rod Tidwell and he really brings some crazy sanity to the other side of the plot which is the schmaltz of Jerry and Dorothy and corny dialogue. His relationship with Jerry is heartwarming, and the bromance between them is the real love interest of the film. Regina King is great as Mrs Tidwell, although I've only seen her play similar roles. Jerry Maquire is rightly hailed as a modern classic film, and whilst I find the romance between Dorothy and Jerry a little ridiculous and far-fetched, it does make it appeal to a wider audience that would other wise be only sports fans. It makes the film cover more genres, makes it different to other sports-films by giving it a number of story threads. Whilst it is predictable and has a very Hollywood ending, you don't really mind as it rounds the package of this film off nicely and it wouldn't have worked so well any other way. Special mention in this film has to go to little Jonathan Lipnicki who plays Dorothy (Renee's) son Ray; he's as cute as a button and adds some rather natural acting for one so young (age 5) as the child who melts Jerry a little bit. Overall, a great movie you can watch over and over, and one of Tom's best roles.

    You can tell after watching Jerry Maguire that this movie isn't in it for just some quick money. The movie has a lot of heart and a great sense of humor to back it up. The story is simple enough, a sports agent loses his job and is desperately trying to keep his head above water in the sports business. He falls in love along the way and it turns into a love story. This movie has a great cast including a Tom Cruise who is wonderful in it. Cruise straddles the line between desperate and crazy with Jerry Maguire and in the process delivers some hilarious scenes (SHOW ME THE MONEY). Cuba Gooding Jr. is strong throughout (as he and Maguire are almost equals in their life situation). The film manages to not go to melodramatic and keep the comedy coming. For me, the whole movie is made by Tom Cruise. In particular, I find his reactions hilarious. The firing sequence along with his facial expressions when answering the devastating phone-call in Cushman's apartment are prime examples of Cruise's greatness in this movie. If you want a flick that is smart and witty but also offers up an engaging love-story and interesting plot, look no further than Jerry Maguire.

    Tom Cruise plays a big time professional Agent signing the big names. supposedly it's loosely based on a major professional real life agent. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a highly skilled football player who just wants to get paid,, hence the phrase and catchline... "Show me the Money". or as Prime Time Deion Sanders would say,,, Pay the Man.. this is a story about how much our sports agent will take and go thru to make his clients happy,, it seems he will have to sell his soul in order to please them,, he decides that working for the agency he's had enough,, and he starts his own agency and takes a beautiful young helper with him,, together they start up his own business, of him being a free lance agent. he tries to spend time at home, as his job requires him to be away a lot, and it just isn't working out for him,, his client keeps bugging him about his new contract deal,, and wanting to get paid.. this movie takes a look at a different sides of sports... very interesting,, just I think Cruise wasn't up to his usual great performance in this one.

    Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a hotshot sports agent. As such, he wants to get the fattest contracts for his clients because his own salary depends on it. He has a type A girlfriend, Avery (Kelly Preston) and a seemingly great life. But, one day, he has an epiphany. Jerry has seen the tears in the eyes of the children who wonder why Mr. Maguire is still talking money when their father or mother is gravely injured and probably shouldn't play again. Therefore, Jerry pens an open letter to his fellow agents at their huge firm, asking them to follow their hearts and not just the dollar signs. Although everyone initially claps Jer on the back, he is soon dumped. The executioner" (Jay Mohr), a more senior agent, does it in a crowded restaurant where he also announces his plans to "takeover" everyone of Maguire's clients. All too soon it happens. Jerry retains only one athlete, Rod (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an iffy client due to injuries. Cleaning out his desk, Jerry bravely tells the entire office he is opening his own agency and asks someone, anyone to go with him. Only one does. That would be Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), a single mother of one darling son, Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki), who admired greatly the stance he took in his open letter. Yet, for both Jerry and Dorothy, the whole start-up biz is an extreme risk, with only one sure client. Meanwhile, Avery dumps her fianc&eacute; on his ear when he loses the chance to represent a rookie NFL quarterback. Truth is, Jerry's old agency told a bunch of lies to steal this young man away. To complicate matters more, Jerry asks Dorothy out on a date, which goes well. Can romance and infant businesses make a good mix? Will Maguire, who stuck his head out for something good, now have it chopped off in the cruel world of capitalism? This is without a doubt Cruise's most enjoyable flick. Even folks who think they don't care for him will enjoy this one. It doesn't hurt, of course, to have sidekicks in Zellweger, Gooding, Jr., Bonnie Hunt, Mohr, Preston and the darling Lipnicki. Then, too, Cameron Crowe, who wrote and directed this gem, deserves lots of praise as well. To complete the movie's success are great costumes, sets, and photography. Come on, folks, re-runs of The Big Valley are nice but why not snag this film instead if you've never had the pleasure of it?

    Amusing comedy drama that alternates between being a mockery of greed in the sports world and romantic comedy. Tom Cruise, in one of his best roles, plays sports agent Jerry Maguire. He is tired of the cynicism in the sports world. When he gets fired and is starting his own business, it is only two who believe in him to succeed. A secretary (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) and a promising player (Cuba Gooding Jr.) in American football. The questions then become two: Will Jerry Maguire get back together with the secretary, who is a single mother? Is the football player going to become a star? The film was nominated for many awards, including best film, but only Cuba Gooding Jr. won an Oscar, then for Best Supporting Actor. Cameron Crowe's film is filled with so much humor, charm and warmth, that it does not matter that it is a bit predictable.

His relationship with Jerry is heartwarming, and the bromance between them is the real love interest of the film. Regina King is great as Mrs Tidwell, although I've only seen her play similar roles. Jerry Maquire is rightly hailed as a modern classic film, and whilst I find the romance between Dorothy and Jerry a little ridiculous and far-fetched, it does make it appeal to a wider audience that would other wise be only sports fans. It makes the film cover more genres, makes it different to other sports-films by giving it a number of story threads. Whilst it is predictable and has a very Hollywood ending, you don't really mind as it rounds the package of this film off nicely and it wouldn't have worked so well any other way. Special mention in this film has to go to little Jonathan Lipnicki who plays Dorothy (Renee's) son Ray; he's as cute as a button and adds some rather natural acting for one so young (age 5) as the child who melts Jerry a little bit. Overall, a great movie you can watch over and over, and one of Tom's best roles.

    You can tell after watching Jerry Maguire that this movie isn't in it for just some quick money. The movie has a lot of heart and a great sense of humor to back it up. The story is simple enough, a sports agent loses his job and is desperately trying to keep his head above water in the sports business. He falls in love along the way and it turns into a love story. This movie has a great cast including a Tom Cruise who is wonderful in it. Cruise straddles the line between desperate and crazy with Jerry Maguire and in the process delivers some hilarious scenes (SHOW ME THE MONEY). Cuba Gooding Jr. is strong throughout (as he and Maguire are almost equals in their life situation). The film manages to not go to melodramatic and keep the comedy coming. For me, the whole movie is made by Tom Cruise. In particular, I find his reactions hilarious. The firing sequence along with his facial expressions when answering the devastating phone-call in Cushman's apartment are prime examples of Cruise's greatness in this movie. If you want a flick that is smart and witty but also offers up an engaging love-story and interesting plot, look no further than Jerry Maguire.

    Tom Cruise plays a big time professional Agent signing the big names. supposedly it's loosely based on a major professional real life agent. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a highly skilled football player who just wants to get paid,, hence the phrase and catchline... "Show me the Money". or as Prime Time Deion Sanders would say,,, Pay the Man.. this is a story about how much our sports agent will take and go thru to make his clients happy,, it seems he will have to sell his soul in order to please them,, he decides that working for the agency he's had enough,, and he starts his own agency and takes a beautiful young helper with him,, together they start up his own business, of him being a free lance agent. he tries to spend time at home, as his job requires him to be away a lot, and it just isn't working out for him,, his client keeps bugging him about his new contract deal,, and wanting to get paid.. this movie takes a look at a different sides of sports... very interesting,, just I think Cruise wasn't up to his usual great performance in this one.

    Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a hotshot sports agent. As such, he wants to get the fattest contracts for his clients because his own salary depends on it. He has a type A girlfriend, Avery (Kelly Preston) and a seemingly great life. But, one day, he has an epiphany. Jerry has seen the tears in the eyes of the children who wonder why Mr. Maguire is still talking money when their father or mother is gravely injured and probably shouldn't play again. Therefore, Jerry pens an open letter to his fellow agents at their huge firm, asking them to follow their hearts and not just the dollar signs. Although everyone initially claps Jer on the back, he is soon dumped. The executioner" (Jay Mohr), a more senior agent, does it in a crowded restaurant where he also announces his plans to "takeover" everyone of Maguire's clients. All too soon it happens. Jerry retains only one athlete, Rod (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an iffy client due to injuries. Cleaning out his desk, Jerry bravely tells the entire office he is opening his own agency and asks someone, anyone to go with him. Only one does. That would be Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), a single mother of one darling son, Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki), who admired greatly the stance he took in his open letter. Yet, for both Jerry and Dorothy, the whole start-up biz is an extreme risk, with only one sure client. Meanwhile, Avery dumps her fianc&eacute; on his ear when he loses the chance to represent a rookie NFL quarterback. Truth is, Jerry's old agency told a bunch of lies to steal this young man away. To complicate matters more, Jerry asks Dorothy out on a date, which goes well. Can romance and infant businesses make a good mix? Will Maguire, who stuck his head out for something good, now have it chopped off in the cruel world of capitalism? This is without a doubt Cruise's most enjoyable flick. Even folks who think they don't care for him will enjoy this one. It doesn't hurt, of course, to have sidekicks in Zellweger, Gooding, Jr., Bonnie Hunt, Mohr, Preston and the darling Lipnicki. Then, too, Cameron Crowe, who wrote and directed this gem, deserves lots of praise as well. To complete the movie's success are great costumes, sets, and photography. Come on, folks, re-runs of The Big Valley are nice but why not snag this film instead if you've never had the pleasure of it?

    Amusing comedy drama that alternates between being a mockery of greed in the sports world and romantic comedy. Tom Cruise, in one of his best roles, plays sports agent Jerry Maguire. He is tired of the cynicism in the sports world. When he gets fired and is starting his own business, it is only two who believe in him to succeed. A secretary (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) and a promising player (Cuba Gooding Jr.) in American football. The questions then become two: Will Jerry Maguire get back together with the secretary, who is a single mother? Is the football player going to become a star? The film was nominated for many awards, including best film, but only Cuba Gooding Jr. won an Oscar, then for Best Supporting Actor. Cameron Crowe's film is filled with so much humor, charm and warmth, that it does not matter that it is a bit predictable.

    "I didn't know it was a romantic comedy." Kristl said. She was leaning back into the couch in the garage turned movie theater,"I was completely fooled by the name and the fact it said someone wrote a statement against greed in sports. I thought it would be a drama in which someone rejects greed. Instead it is just a story vehicle to have two people meet." "I didn't know either. A romantic comedy! The last one I saw was When Harry met Sally. I think that was more than enough romcom to last me a lifetime." Henry laid down the remote. "So what now?" "Maybe we ought to sit it out..You know, can we judge a movie based on the first thirty minutes? Although it has Tom Cruise in it. A romantic comedy with Tom Cruise. That is so wrong." "And no action. And Renee Zellweger..the girl that looks like she is perpetually on the verge of a nervous breakdown and about to cry. I think she can't really act, just plays one person called Renee Zellweger with one facial expression." "She does it very well though. But Tom Cruise as an love interest. Horrible. I can't see him as a nice man in this movie, but as a sleek guy with a fake smile... but most of all, his cold eyes.. Brr." Kristl shivered, "But he was great in movies like Born on the Fourth of July, or Rain Man or Collateral." "To be fair we ought to watch a movie with Tom Cruise at his best. A movie where he kicks ass," Henry said, "Like Mission Impossible." "Beg your pardon?" Kristl raised an eyebrow. "Minority Report then?" "Are you serious?" "The Last Samurai?" "Nope." Kristl shook her head. "What then? Not Rain Man please" "How about Collateral?" "It's a deal."

    Jerry Maguire is what it is because it blends everything it has to begin with, with talented writing and phenomenal performances from Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. This story at first is in a way, a satire of American sports. Everything from NFL drafts to player's wages, the film exploits everything in between at the very beginning. At first, Jerry Maguire is Tom Cruise. Literally, this is the same character that Cruise has played in every film since Risky Business. However, you really get to know the character and feel great sympathy for him. He certainly did not deserve everything to happen to him, and you really get a great sense of his peers as well. Is this really what it is, or more like, is this really how it is? Either way this is the best performance of Tom Cruise's career hands-down. Cuba Gooding Jr is the real star of the show. He deserved his best supporting actor Oscar as much as Cruise deserved his best actor. The two work well off each other, and you really anticipate the next time they are on screen together. The film slowly evolves into a love story, not only between Cruise and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, but the bond between Cruise and Cuba. This is a film that works, every cheesy but quotable line, every chuckle from Cuba Gooding Jr being an outlandish diva and every time you realize that this is a film that is much deeper than what you may have thought. Go see it.

    Jerry Maguire is now pop culture reference material. "You had me at Hello" and "You complete me" are some of the most commonly quoted movie phrase in North America. Underneath that is a romance born of unusual circumstances. The good. Very interesting story with a unique setup. Well paced scenario. Excellent character psychology and interactions. The actors. Tom Cruise goes all out, but his best scenes are the ones where he's calm. Cuba Gooding Jr. is just spot on as the self-centered athlete. And Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is at her cutest and most vulnerable as the lost single mother. The bad. Acting exaggerations on the part of Cruise and Gooding. It's probably what made it popular in the first place, but watching it now, for the third time, it's unnerving. Also, the kid might have been cute the first time you see the flick, but he's really not a good child actor. The ugly. Quarterback Troy Aikman shows once again that professional athlete can't act to save their lives. It's a good thing he's got only two lines. The result. Very good entertainment for the romantics with a bit of sport thrown in the mix.

    This is a Tom Cruise movie, but I did not hold that against it. For some reason I wanted to see this movie, not because it was a Tom Cruise movie, but because of the plot about how the main character, Jerry Maguire, lost his job as a sports agent and then went out on his own to build up his empire again. The plot is not that shallow, rather the character of Maguire begins as a business orientated, money loving, sports agent until he is confronted with the reality of his character through the hatred of the son of a badly injured ice hockey player. At this point he realises that his desire is to purely make money off of other people and that he does not care about the person whom he is making money off. At that point he writes a mission statement which he intends to change the whole industry with - and even though he is congratulated with his stand, the competitiveness of the industry means that the younger agents seize this moment of weakness and throw him out. In the ensuing struggle he manages to gain two stars to work for, and then the famous one walks out on him leaving his with an angry black football player who wants a great contract but is not willing to work for it. Through the movie we see Maguire's character struggle through his problems, and his character rely on what are defined as his weaknesses. At the bachelor party at the beginning his one major weakness is revealed: he needs a woman to support him - he cannot be alone. So when he looses his job, he also walks out on his star fianc&eacute;e because he simply feels that he does not deserve her. He has lost everything else so by all intents and purposes, he should loose her as well. This is where the other character comes in. An accountant at the firm Maguire worked for who was inspired by his mission statement. When Maguire calls for people to leave with him, she is the only one who does, but she also has a desire - she wants an husband and a father for her child. This is strengthened through the movie as she continues to look at people in love and think about how she wants that for himself. This is bad because Maguire can't be alone, and she knows that, so she sees her chance and takes him. The thing that makes this a little different is that Maguire loves her kid. This weakness of Maguire's is continually exploited as he struggles with his single client, who is so stubborn that he refuses to leave Maquire, but he also refuses to listen to Maguire's advice. In the end they must settle with a weak contract because there is little else that they can get. It is only when he breaks out of his shell that things start to happen, and because Maguire has been his friend as well as his agent, this relationship is strengthened. But his character is also there to show what a strong marriage relationship is all about. As we watch Maguire and his secretary romanticise over each other, we know that it is not a relationship of love, but one of necessity. When they do get married, we know that it is because Maguire simply does not want her to leave as opposed to really loving her. The illusionary relationship is developed as it is contrasted with that of Maguire's client. We see a husband and wife who truly love each other, while Maguire and his wife seem to drift apart as Maguire spends more time with his client and his son. This is a great movie, and it is surprisingly deep for an American movie. The characters are finely crafted and they each have to struggle through their problems, all of them looking for the easy way out but knowing that it is not the best way out. For a Tom Cruise movie, it is actually quite good.

    I will try to not parrot what has already been said about the movie, for better or worse. I have nothing against the actors of the feature film. They were the best of the best in that genre and generation. My issue is with all the product placement and overall marketing that the film is bombarded with ranging from Reebok, Apple Jacks, NFL and I don't know how many other products. If one is not discerning, one can fall for it and feel like ESPN is the ultimate authority in sports and that the NFL is the best thing that there is. I won't question the integrity of these entities because that's not what this review is about. The cameos from real life corporate executives further reinforced the marketing at play her. I just think that it would have felt more artistic and original to have come up with a pretend organization resembling the ones mentioned so that the viewer is not resold on the idea that big corporations truly benefit humanity and actually constitute a culture. For a movie about redemption and love, there is the underlying message that money and materialism is the agent that facilitates can destroy and redeem you. This may be true, and I am no bleeding heart; but movies should not always reinforce the obvious. One of the more positive aspects of the movie was seeing the Tidwell's as a normal and married black couple rather than bickering losers having illegitimate offspring. You could see Crowe's sensitivity and trying to elevate the dialogue without being soppy. I think what made this movie so zeitgeist was that it captured and incorporated the rampant and materialism of the 1990s. This decade was more greedy than the 80s because suddenly actors and athletes had the fattest paychecks simply for being entertainers. They suddenly became royalty. This decade was the beginning of the endorsement culture that blew up in the 2000s. The general public truly believed that bigger was better and resented being told otherwise. SUV's, designer clothes, limitless credit cards, supersized meals and Venti sized coffee's were almost a requirement. If you want to see a well acted film you will not be disappointed. I recommend looking at the movie with a grain of salt and detaching oneself from the underlying capitalist and elitist message that it sends.

    I like Tom Cruise, he plays Tom Cruise really well, and this is no different. Jerry Maguire is a Sports Agent who after an epiphany of conscience sets up on his own. That's when Renee Zellweger brings the unlikely into the plot. Everything apart from Jerry's relationship with Dorothy in this film is plausible. Bonnie Hunt (always a good bet) plays the sensible sister whom Dorothy could listen to once in a while. Sure it plays out in true Hollywood fashion - yay - but I get angry at characters like Dorothy Boyd, annoying and silly. Tom is great, Jay Mohr (Sugar, the rival agent) plays sleaze so well, Cuba Gooding Jnr's flamboyant extrovert over-the-top manic is perfect for his role as Rod Tidwell and he really brings some crazy sanity to the other side of the plot which is the schmaltz of Jerry and Dorothy and corny dialogue. His relationship with Jerry is heartwarming, and the bromance between them is the real love interest of the film. Regina King is great as Mrs Tidwell, although I've only seen her play similar roles. Jerry Maquire is rightly hailed as a modern classic film, and whilst I find the romance between Dorothy and Jerry a little ridiculous and far-fetched, it does make it appeal to a wider audience that would other wise be only sports fans.

Overall, a great movie you can watch over and over, and one of Tom's best roles.

    Jerry Maguire is now pop culture reference material. "You had me at Hello" and "You complete me" are some of the most commonly quoted movie phrase in North America. Underneath that is a romance born of unusual circumstances. The good. Very interesting story with a unique setup. Well paced scenario. Excellent character psychology and interactions. The actors. Tom Cruise goes all out, but his best scenes are the ones where he's calm. Cuba Gooding Jr. is just spot on as the self-centered athlete. And Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is at her cutest and most vulnerable as the lost single mother. The bad. Acting exaggerations on the part of Cruise and Gooding. It's probably what made it popular in the first place, but watching it now, for the third time, it's unnerving. Also, the kid might have been cute the first time you see the flick, but he's really not a good child actor. The ugly. Quarterback Troy Aikman shows once again that professional athlete can't act to save their lives. It's a good thing he's got only two lines. The result. Very good entertainment for the romantics with a bit of sport thrown in the mix.

    This is a Tom Cruise movie, but I did not hold that against it. For some reason I wanted to see this movie, not because it was a Tom Cruise movie, but because of the plot about how the main character, Jerry Maguire, lost his job as a sports agent and then went out on his own to build up his empire again. The plot is not that shallow, rather the character of Maguire begins as a business orientated, money loving, sports agent until he is confronted with the reality of his character through the hatred of the son of a badly injured ice hockey player. At this point he realises that his desire is to purely make money off of other people and that he does not care about the person whom he is making money off. At that point he writes a mission statement which he intends to change the whole industry with - and even though he is congratulated with his stand, the competitiveness of the industry means that the younger agents seize this moment of weakness and throw him out. In the ensuing struggle he manages to gain two stars to work for, and then the famous one walks out on him leaving his with an angry black football player who wants a great contract but is not willing to work for it. Through the movie we see Maguire's character struggle through his problems, and his character rely on what are defined as his weaknesses. At the bachelor party at the beginning his one major weakness is revealed: he needs a woman to support him - he cannot be alone. So when he looses his job, he also walks out on his star fianc&eacute;e because he simply feels that he does not deserve her. He has lost everything else so by all intents and purposes, he should loose her as well. This is where the other character comes in. An accountant at the firm Maguire worked for who was inspired by his mission statement. When Maguire calls for people to leave with him, she is the only one who does, but she also has a desire - she wants an husband and a father for her child. This is strengthened through the movie as she continues to look at people in love and think about how she wants that for himself. This is bad because Maguire can't be alone, and she knows that, so she sees her chance and takes him. The thing that makes this a little different is that Maguire loves her kid. This weakness of Maguire's is continually exploited as he struggles with his single client, who is so stubborn that he refuses to leave Maquire, but he also refuses to listen to Maguire's advice. In the end they must settle with a weak contract because there is little else that they can get. It is only when he breaks out of his shell that things start to happen, and because Maguire has been his friend as well as his agent, this relationship is strengthened. But his character is also there to show what a strong marriage relationship is all about. As we watch Maguire and his secretary romanticise over each other, we know that it is not a relationship of love, but one of necessity. When they do get married, we know that it is because Maguire simply does not want her to leave as opposed to really loving her. The illusionary relationship is developed as it is contrasted with that of Maguire's client. We see a husband and wife who truly love each other, while Maguire and his wife seem to drift apart as Maguire spends more time with his client and his son. This is a great movie, and it is surprisingly deep for an American movie. The characters are finely crafted and they each have to struggle through their problems, all of them looking for the easy way out but knowing that it is not the best way out. For a Tom Cruise movie, it is actually quite good.

    I will try to not parrot what has already been said about the movie, for better or worse. I have nothing against the actors of the feature film. They were the best of the best in that genre and generation. My issue is with all the product placement and overall marketing that the film is bombarded with ranging from Reebok, Apple Jacks, NFL and I don't know how many other products. If one is not discerning, one can fall for it and feel like ESPN is the ultimate authority in sports and that the NFL is the best thing that there is. I won't question the integrity of these entities because that's not what this review is about. The cameos from real life corporate executives further reinforced the marketing at play her. I just think that it would have felt more artistic and original to have come up with a pretend organization resembling the ones mentioned so that the viewer is not resold on the idea that big corporations truly benefit humanity and actually constitute a culture. For a movie about redemption and love, there is the underlying message that money and materialism is the agent that facilitates can destroy and redeem you. This may be true, and I am no bleeding heart; but movies should not always reinforce the obvious. One of the more positive aspects of the movie was seeing the Tidwell's as a normal and married black couple rather than bickering losers having illegitimate offspring. You could see Crowe's sensitivity and trying to elevate the dialogue without being soppy. I think what made this movie so zeitgeist was that it captured and incorporated the rampant and materialism of the 1990s. This decade was more greedy than the 80s because suddenly actors and athletes had the fattest paychecks simply for being entertainers. They suddenly became royalty. This decade was the beginning of the endorsement culture that blew up in the 2000s. The general public truly believed that bigger was better and resented being told otherwise. SUV's, designer clothes, limitless credit cards, supersized meals and Venti sized coffee's were almost a requirement. If you want to see a well acted film you will not be disappointed. I recommend looking at the movie with a grain of salt and detaching oneself from the underlying capitalist and elitist message that it sends.

    I like Tom Cruise, he plays Tom Cruise really well, and this is no different. Jerry Maguire is a Sports Agent who after an epiphany of conscience sets up on his own. That's when Renee Zellweger brings the unlikely into the plot. Everything apart from Jerry's relationship with Dorothy in this film is plausible. Bonnie Hunt (always a good bet) plays the sensible sister whom Dorothy could listen to once in a while. Sure it plays out in true Hollywood fashion - yay - but I get angry at characters like Dorothy Boyd, annoying and silly. Tom is great, Jay Mohr (Sugar, the rival agent) plays sleaze so well, Cuba Gooding Jnr's flamboyant extrovert over-the-top manic is perfect for his role as Rod Tidwell and he really brings some crazy sanity to the other side of the plot which is the schmaltz of Jerry and Dorothy and corny dialogue. His relationship with Jerry is heartwarming, and the bromance between them is the real love interest of the film. Regina King is great as Mrs Tidwell, although I've only seen her play similar roles. Jerry Maquire is rightly hailed as a modern classic film, and whilst I find the romance between Dorothy and Jerry a little ridiculous and far-fetched, it does make it appeal to a wider audience that would other wise be only sports fans. It makes the film cover more genres, makes it different to other sports-films by giving it a number of story threads. Whilst it is predictable and has a very Hollywood ending, you don't really mind as it rounds the package of this film off nicely and it wouldn't have worked so well any other way. Special mention in this film has to go to little Jonathan Lipnicki who plays Dorothy (Renee's) son Ray; he's as cute as a button and adds some rather natural acting for one so young (age 5) as the child who melts Jerry a little bit. Overall, a great movie you can watch over and over, and one of Tom's best roles.

    You can tell after watching Jerry Maguire that this movie isn't in it for just some quick money. The movie has a lot of heart and a great sense of humor to back it up. The story is simple enough, a sports agent loses his job and is desperately trying to keep his head above water in the sports business. He falls in love along the way and it turns into a love story. This movie has a great cast including a Tom Cruise who is wonderful in it. Cruise straddles the line between desperate and crazy with Jerry Maguire and in the process delivers some hilarious scenes (SHOW ME THE MONEY). Cuba Gooding Jr. is strong throughout (as he and Maguire are almost equals in their life situation). The film manages to not go to melodramatic and keep the comedy coming. For me, the whole movie is made by Tom Cruise. In particular, I find his reactions hilarious. The firing sequence along with his facial expressions when answering the devastating phone-call in Cushman's apartment are prime examples of Cruise's greatness in this movie. If you want a flick that is smart and witty but also offers up an engaging love-story and interesting plot, look no further than Jerry Maguire.
