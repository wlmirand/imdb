 <sinopse>
  A man needing money agrees to impersonate a nonexistent person who said he'd be committing suicide as a protest, and a political movement begins.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  As a parting shot, fired reporter Ann Mitchell prints a fake letter from unemployed "John Doe," who threatens suicide in protest of social ills. The paper is forced to rehire Ann and hires John Willoughby to impersonate "Doe." Ann and her bosses cynically milk the story for all it's worth, until the made-up "John Doe" philosophy starts a whole political movement. At last everyone, even Ann, takes her creation seriously...but publisher D.B. Norton has a secret plan.

    "Meet John Doe" would be the finest movie ever made, in my opinion, except for the ending. Director Frank Capra filmed several different endings, and probably chose the best one, but ultimately found them all lacking in some way. I share his view, but even without a satisfying climax, "Meet John Doe" represents the motion picture industry at its absolute best. Gary Cooper is perfect as Long John Willoughby, a homeless ex-baseball pitcher with a bum arm. Walter Brennan turns in perhaps his greatest role, as "The Colonel," a grumpy fellow who calls people "Healots" and utters the memorable line, "I know the world's been shaved by a drunken barber." Barbara Stanwyck, as always, turns in a compelling performance. Capra invariably supplied his movies with a wealth of strong background characters, and "Meet John Doe" is no exception. Regis Toomey, at one time a leading man in the early talkies, is particularly good as Bert the Soda Jerk. The script sets up one of the most intriguing premises imaginable; reporter Stanwyck, in a bid to save her job and build circulation, invents a character, "John Doe," who threatens to jump off the roof of the highest building in town on Christmas Eve, if people don't start being nicer to each other. His column "I Protest," becomes so popular that the newspaper has to produce an actual "John Doe," and Cooper wins the part. Gradually, the naive, well meaning Cooper begins to believe in what "John Doe" is saying, and falls in love with Stanwyck, who has been co-opted by powerful forces, led by the dastardly Edward Arnold, playing the evil tycoon Norton. James Gleason is great here, as the drunken editor who tries to warn Cooper that Stanwyck is a phony. He's perfect for Capra's type of movie, so it's a surprise that this is the only one he ever appeared in. The drama in this film is everywhere; Cooper's affection for Stanwyck, whose hard boiled heart begins to melt, the burgeoning populist "John Doe" political movement, and the uncertain resolution to "John Doe's" dilemma. As it becomes obvious that people are not going to start treating each other better, the question becomes- will Cooper actually jump on Christmas Eve? Does he still believe in an ideology that Stanwyck created, for dishonest and cynical reasons? "Meet John Doe" features Capra's typical dark look at humanity, as exemplified by Stanwyck's deviousness, and the ugly mob mentality of the "John Doe" supporters as they turn on Cooper. However, again as always, Capra turns that pessimistic view into a fairy tale-like optimism, as Stanwyck comes to believe in Cooper and thus her own philosophy, and the mob realizes realizes the error of its ways. In Capra's films, no matter how extensive the corruption appears, justice always triumphs and the little guy always wins. Thus, it was predictable that Capra would choose the happiest ending possible, with Cooper being saved from jumping at the last minute, by an ill Stanwyck and the mob, represented by Toomis's soda jerk and his wife, as Gleason utters the line, "There you go, Norton- the people! Try and lick that!" I suppose there was really no adequate way to resolve a plot line like this, and Capra did the best he could. Regardless, "Meet John Doe" is head and shoulders above almost any other film Hollywood has ever produced.

    A man needing money (Gary Cooper) agrees to impersonate a nonexistent person who said he would be committing suicide as a protest, and a political movement begins. What a great story of the Great Depression, community, greed, politics, the newspaper business and "helots". I especially love that even if I did not know it was Frank Capra's movie, I would still have figured it out... he just has such an optimistic worldview and a way of making the tragic seem like an opportunity... The film needs a good cleaning up. At least, the version I watched did. Somehow the film escaped Warner Brothers and made it into the public domain. Does a good version exist? Maybe. But it is far easier to find the other versions... and while they are not terrible, there is obviously some aging.

    I highly recommend "Meet John Doe", starring Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Cooper. It's the 1941 predecessor to "It's a Wonderful Life" and the perfect alternative! In fact, I like it 10 times better! Yes, "Meet John Doe" is without a doubt my new favorite movie (excluding my childhood favorite, Mary Martin's Peter Pan, of course), the film I love the best, top' a the list, number one!! I think if you like movies with a message of love, movies that make you smile, those that resonate with human longing, enthusiasm, and reconciliation, you'll love this! And, if you are a Stanwyck fan as I am, this is a must-see! 1941 was a big year for Stanwyck, who starred in three of the most well-received hits of her career-"Meet John Doe", "The Lady Eve", and "Ball of Fire". So successful was this string of movies that they caused Miss Stanwyck's career to hit a high that wouldn't be topped until three years later, with the release of Paramount Pictures' film-noir triumph, "Double Indemnity". Meet John Doe was the second of that 1941 trio of hits, the most heartwarming, and perfect for those of us who are all burnt out on the better known classics.

    I like Frank Capra's films a lot, my favourites being It's a Wonderful Life and Mr Smith goes to Washington. Meet John Doe is not quite a classic for me, but it is still very good. Some of the characters could have done with more colour and the film's messages and warnings while appropriate and relevant do have a tendency to preach. That said, it is gorgeously filmed, Dmitri Tiomkin's score is outstanding, the dialogue is funny, touching and intelligent and the story is moving while having a dark centre to it. Capra does a solid job directing, while there is a divine cast with Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyk and Edward Arnold particularly outstanding. In conclusion, very good if not quite a classic. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Gary Cooper is the pigeon set up by crooked politician Edward Arnold to embody the downtrodden Everyman: friendless, out of work, suicidal; but after the public overwhelmingly responds to 'John Doe' and his wholesome pleas to love thy neighbor, Cooper realizes he's been duped and the politico threatens to expose him as a fraud. Preachy, though well-acted drama about the fickle heart of humanity leads to woebegone conclusion which no one behind the camera was quite satisfied with. The original story from Richard Connell and Robert Presnell was nominated for an Oscar, but only in the film's vibrant first-half do we get a sense of something fresh and exciting happening. Director Frank Capra once again settles for sentiment over substance. ** from ****

    This movie couldn't be more salient and relevant to our times. The "John Doe Clubs" had the appearance of embodying the disgruntled sentiments of the "Little Man", just like the "Tea Party Movement" today (which one quipster rightly has called "an exercise in mass false consciousness"). These movements of the "little man" have a long history in the US and Europe (in the US, the "Know-Nothings" of the 1850s & Father Coughlin of the 1930s, in France, the "Poujadistes", in Italy the "Qualunquisti"); and all of them end up diverting attention away from the real enemies of little people, the fat cats at the top--in Capra's movie wonderfully incarnated in Edward Arnold's character, D.B.Norton (the real-life counterparts today to D.B. Norton, and who've done a fab job of manipulating "the little people", are the Koch brothers). Capra rightly sensed that the little man's rage at being buffeted about by forces bigger than himself was exploited by the fascist movements of Europe to create right-wing mass parties which, in the end, served to protect the privileges of the wealthiest social classes from revolutionary egalitarian movements.

    It always seemed to me that Capra's dark allegory against fascism has been unfairly overlooked down the years in favour of the more celebrated "Mr" films "Deeds" and "Smith" as well of course as the universally loved "It's A Wonderful Life". It could be just down to it having had a lower circulation down the years (you rarely see it on TV schedules, at least here in the UK), or its war-time genesis, or just that it has a less clearly defined happy ending than its three siblings, but for me there's no question that it fully punches its weight and continues to do so almost 70 years since its release. "Capra-corn" cynics may again mock the director's seemingly simplistic take on the malleability and simplicity of the American public at large, which here sees them swallow whole self-serving journalist Barbara Stanwyck's phony story about an "everyman" so disenchanted with the selfishness of society that he will make a suicidal sacrifice of himself on Christmas Eve to drive home his point. When she produces a stooge to actually play the part (Cooper's vagrant, baseball-loving Long John Willoughby) his scripted "John Doe" idealism strikes home in Anytown USA, fanned by Stanwyck's initially manipulative and no less cynical newspaper editor James Gleason. So far so good. However the the cause takes an altogether darker turn when it's later taken up by would-be dictator Edmund Arnold's sinister megalomaniac magnate DB Norton and his acolytes of faceless power-sharers. The initial scene where we are introduced to Norton, with a high-power display of motorcycle riders seems to these eyes a premonition of the way that today's dictators invariably preside over displays of their war machinery, usually at May Day parades. The more things change... The movie brilliantly takes us on the respective journeys of all these major characters to self-awareness at the same time making its bigger point about the dangers of state control (a rallying call against the rise of fascism engulfing war-torn Europe at the time of the movie's creation) with great subtlety and conviction. I've read that Capra agonised over a suitable ending for the movie and balk a little myself at the perhaps over-zealous religious symbolism of Cooper's character as a Christ-like figure, rebuffed as a prophet in his own time, turned on by the mob and walking towards self-destruction on Christmas eve. That said, some fantastic acting by Cooper and superb direction by Capra at the climactic scene held enough sway for me to trust the outcome as seen. Capra as ever, deftly handles his actors, prising superb performances from Arnold, Stanwyck, Gleason and Walter Brennan (as Willoughby's vagrant chum, the only one to see through the emperor's new clothes with his humorous "Helots" pronouncements) and especially Cooper who progresses his trademark gawky, bumbling sub-Deeds "average-Joe" character to someone altogether more complex and real by the finish. The cinematography too, is great, particularly in evidence at the pivotal mob scene where Capra again displays his mastery of editing and crowd control. I'd forgotten the tie-in to Christmas at the finale and was glad that I was watching a movie at this time with a weightier message than most every other film of this festive season (even as I appreciate it was initially released in May of 1941!). On the DVD mini-focus on Capra, he's described at one point as a 20th Century Dickens. Taking into account the quality of the peak of his work from "It Happened One Night" in 1934 through to "State Of The Union" in 1948 (with "Meet John Doe" at the epicentre both episodically and fundamentally) I firmly believe he deserves this "timeless" accolade more than any other director I can think of.

    Three Oscars and some successful films under his belt, socially-conscious auteur Frank Capra wanted critical acclaim. So, using a news article that's been in development hell since the 1920s as inspiration, he and scribe pal Bob Riskin composed "Meet John Doe", a tale that's an earnest testament to the common man. A newspaper, the Bulletin, is bought by an oil company. People are sacked, including ambitious reporter Ann Mitchell (spunky, sweet Barbara Stanwyck). Worried about her mom and two kid sisters, Mitchell quickly gets her job back by writing a phony letter, by a "John Doe" who plans to kill himself on Christmas Eve because he's frustrated with the "cold, cruel world", increasing the paper's profits. Derelicts flood the paper's officers, claiming to be the writer, after hearing prospects of getting food and a job. Only one man is picked for the role: John Willoughby (lean, humble Gary Cooper of "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town), an ex-bush league ballplayer, due to a bad arm. With Mitchell as his speech scribe, Willoughby becomes an icon of hope to American's common people and the hoax becomes a crusade, with the motto: "Love thy neighbor". However, the motto's ready to be twisted by ogre-like oil magnate, D.B. Norton (Edward Arnold of "You Can't Take It With You" and "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"), who eyes the White House to be conquered by turning by the John Doe movement into a third party. Will Willoughby have the courage and decency to expose Norton while endangering himself? Like other Capra works, "Doe" has the conflict of the little guy fighting the big guy, but this work's deep and honest with that conflict. Capra, to avoid studio interference, formed a temporary studio to finance the film himself. Who could blame him, for the Norton persona is both obviously allegorical (news magnate William Randolph Hearst, Columbia Pictures's co-head Harry Cohn) and prophetic (Rupert Murdoch), with his tactics, politically ambitious and corporate shark-like. Riskin's script is crackerjack, and the actors give it life. Cooper's shy and earnest, matching Stanwyck's boldness and passion. Supporting players are noteworthy; James Gleason's hardboiled as Stanwyck's editor; Cooper's longtime chum Walter Brennan ("The Real McCoys") is a hole-infested misanthropism sack as Willoughby's pal, the Colonel (his "Heelots" speech is funny, sad and thought-provoking); Irving Bacon ("Deeds") provides goofiness as newspaper gopher Beany and Spring Brighton ("Take It") is warm and wise as Ann's mom. Some people today have hijacked elements of Capra's work, emphasizing on moral values while crucifying those who aren't like them. They, like Norton, have forgotten a sense of humility. With humor and drama, "Doe" has that.

    In a attempt to boost profits, publisher Edward Arnold (as D.B. Norton) changes his metropolitan newspaper from "The Bulletin" to "The New Bulletin", and its motto from "A free press for a free people," to "A streamlined newspaper for a streamlined era." Unfortunately, for leggy columnist Barbara Stanwyck (as Ann Mitchell), "streamlining" means she loses her job. Managing editor James Gleason (as Henry Connell) explains Ms. Stanwyck's columns lack "fireworks"; so, she leaves the paper with an explosive last shot - in her final column, Stanwyck makes up a story about a man threatening to commit suicide due to the sad state of world affairs. The man, called "John Doe", vows to jump from the roof of City Hall on Christmas Eve. Stanwyck's story is a sensational circulation booster, and she gets to keep her job. Good thing, as she is supporting an overspending mother (Spring Byington), two girls, and a dog. To keep the story going, Stanwyck and the "Bulletin" hire hobo Gary Cooper (as Long John Willoughby) to play the part of "John Doe" until December 26th; after which, he will be sent packing. A baseball player with a bum arm, Mr. Cooper has been sleeping "under the bridge" with bumming pal Walter Brennan (as "Colonel"). The two men move in to a swanky hotel room, and Mr. Brennan tries to get Mr. Cooper to return to life as his homeless companion. Struggling with the morality of his impersonation, Cooper shocks everyone by contemplating an actual suicidal jump. There are a lot of "swell" Frank Capra touches in the film - especially keep an eye on Brennan, who makes the most of his "tramp" costume. The film is very well directed, and features an outstanding cast of dependable performers. Stanwyck is "Best Actress"-worthy (many of her lead performances are). By the end of 1941, many of the actors herein were nominated for performances in other films - Stanwyck in "Ball of Fire", Copper in "Sergeant York", Brennan in "The Westerner", and Mr. Gleason in "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" - each could have conceivably been nominated for "Meet John Doe". The office boy signaling the opening layoffs (future "Bowery Boy" Benny Bartlett) also portends a wealth of small roles, walk-ons, and bit players. Watch for silent film star Rod La Rocque to shine for the last time, in his well-suited role as Mr. Arnold's nephew "Ted Sheldon ". Cinematographer George Barnes excels, particularly during the last act. The film ends up uneasily celebrating Christianity as the healer of its open, festering wounds. "Meet John Doe" falls in to a worthwhile second tier of Capra productions; he and writer Robert Riskin ended their string of successful collaborations with this one. ******** Meet John Doe (5/3/41) Frank Capra ~ Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyck, Walter Brennan, James Gleason

    Reporter Ann Mitchell gets fired.As a parting shot she writes a fake letter from a unenomployed "John Doe".This nonexistent John Doe threatens to take his own life on Christman Eve as a protest of social ills.The paper has to rehire Ann Mitchell and hire someone to impersonate John Doe.That someone is John Willoughby, also known as Long John, who used to be a baseball player and is now a tramp.He is in desperate need of money to repair his injured arm so that he can play again.So he becomes John Doe.He becomes a national hero, the hero of the common folks.He steps into a diner and the whole place goes all crazy when they find out John Doe is there.The Doe philosophy spreads across the country.It takes a whole new turn, to the worse, when it develops into a political movement.The newspaper's publisher D.B. Norton plans to use Doe as his way into the White House.Meet John Doe (1941) is a Frank Capra movie.Frank Capra's first choice to play John Doe was Gary Cooper, and he got the part.Hardly anybody could do the job better than him.Cooper took the job without even reading the script.He enjoyed his earlier collaboration with Capra five years earlier, and he also wanted to work with Barbara Stanwyck.Stanwyck is the perfect woman to play the role of Ann Mitchell.Edward Arnold is a perfect man to play the villain, Mr. Norton.You have to like Walter Brennan, who plays the tramp friend of John, The Colonel.Spring Byington is marvelous as Ann's mother.James Gleason is great as Henry Connell.Regis Toomey plays the soda jerk Bert Hansen and Ann Doran is Mrs. Hansen.They have been showing his pictures here for the past few weeks and just yesterday I saw this one. is the But This movie is a mixture of harsh realism and optimism.Frank Capra's movies are there to give hope.They are the perfect cure for the cynicism.

    Gary Cooper is the pigeon set up by crooked politician Edward Arnold to embody the downtrodden Everyman: friendless, out of work, suicidal; but after the public overwhelmingly responds to 'John Doe' and his wholesome pleas to love thy neighbor, Cooper realizes he's been duped and the politico threatens to expose him as a fraud. Preachy, though well-acted drama about the fickle heart of humanity leads to woebegone conclusion which no one behind the camera was quite satisfied with. The original story from Richard Connell and Robert Presnell was nominated for an Oscar, but only in the film's vibrant first-half do we get a sense of something fresh and exciting happening. Director Frank Capra once again settles for sentiment over substance. ** from ****

    This movie couldn't be more salient and relevant to our times. The "John Doe Clubs" had the appearance of embodying the disgruntled sentiments of the "Little Man", just like the "Tea Party Movement" today (which one quipster rightly has called "an exercise in mass false consciousness"). These movements of the "little man" have a long history in the US and Europe (in the US, the "Know-Nothings" of the 1850s & Father Coughlin of the 1930s, in France, the "Poujadistes", in Italy the "Qualunquisti"); and all of them end up diverting attention away from the real enemies of little people, the fat cats at the top--in Capra's movie wonderfully incarnated in Edward Arnold's character, D.B.Norton (the real-life counterparts today to D.B. Norton, and who've done a fab job of manipulating "the little people", are the Koch brothers). Capra rightly sensed that the little man's rage at being buffeted about by forces bigger than himself was exploited by the fascist movements of Europe to create right-wing mass parties which, in the end, served to protect the privileges of the wealthiest social classes from revolutionary egalitarian movements.

    It always seemed to me that Capra's dark allegory against fascism has been unfairly overlooked down the years in favour of the more celebrated "Mr" films "Deeds" and "Smith" as well of course as the universally loved "It's A Wonderful Life". It could be just down to it having had a lower circulation down the years (you rarely see it on TV schedules, at least here in the UK), or its war-time genesis, or just that it has a less clearly defined happy ending than its three siblings, but for me there's no question that it fully punches its weight and continues to do so almost 70 years since its release. "Capra-corn" cynics may again mock the director's seemingly simplistic take on the malleability and simplicity of the American public at large, which here sees them swallow whole self-serving journalist Barbara Stanwyck's phony story about an "everyman" so disenchanted with the selfishness of society that he will make a suicidal sacrifice of himself on Christmas Eve to drive home his point. When she produces a stooge to actually play the part (Cooper's vagrant, baseball-loving Long John Willoughby) his scripted "John Doe" idealism strikes home in Anytown USA, fanned by Stanwyck's initially manipulative and no less cynical newspaper editor James Gleason. So far so good. However the the cause takes an altogether darker turn when it's later taken up by would-be dictator Edmund Arnold's sinister megalomaniac magnate DB Norton and his acolytes of faceless power-sharers. The initial scene where we are introduced to Norton, with a high-power display of motorcycle riders seems to these eyes a premonition of the way that today's dictators invariably preside over displays of their war machinery, usually at May Day parades. The more things change... The movie brilliantly takes us on the respective journeys of all these major characters to self-awareness at the same time making its bigger point about the dangers of state control (a rallying call against the rise of fascism engulfing war-torn Europe at the time of the movie's creation) with great subtlety and conviction. I've read that Capra agonised over a suitable ending for the movie and balk a little myself at the perhaps over-zealous religious symbolism of Cooper's character as a Christ-like figure, rebuffed as a prophet in his own time, turned on by the mob and walking towards self-destruction on Christmas eve. That said, some fantastic acting by Cooper and superb direction by Capra at the climactic scene held enough sway for me to trust the outcome as seen. Capra as ever, deftly handles his actors, prising superb performances from Arnold, Stanwyck, Gleason and Walter Brennan (as Willoughby's vagrant chum, the only one to see through the emperor's new clothes with his humorous "Helots" pronouncements) and especially Cooper who progresses his trademark gawky, bumbling sub-Deeds "average-Joe" character to someone altogether more complex and real by the finish. The cinematography too, is great, particularly in evidence at the pivotal mob scene where Capra again displays his mastery of editing and crowd control. I'd forgotten the tie-in to Christmas at the finale and was glad that I was watching a movie at this time with a weightier message than most every other film of this festive season (even as I appreciate it was initially released in May of 1941!). On the DVD mini-focus on Capra, he's described at one point as a 20th Century Dickens. Taking into account the quality of the peak of his work from "It Happened One Night" in 1934 through to "State Of The Union" in 1948 (with "Meet John Doe" at the epicentre both episodically and fundamentally) I firmly believe he deserves this "timeless" accolade more than any other director I can think of.

    Three Oscars and some successful films under his belt, socially-conscious auteur Frank Capra wanted critical acclaim. So, using a news article that's been in development hell since the 1920s as inspiration, he and scribe pal Bob Riskin composed "Meet John Doe", a tale that's an earnest testament to the common man. A newspaper, the Bulletin, is bought by an oil company. People are sacked, including ambitious reporter Ann Mitchell (spunky, sweet Barbara Stanwyck). Worried about her mom and two kid sisters, Mitchell quickly gets her job back by writing a phony letter, by a "John Doe" who plans to kill himself on Christmas Eve because he's frustrated with the "cold, cruel world", increasing the paper's profits. Derelicts flood the paper's officers, claiming to be the writer, after hearing prospects of getting food and a job. Only one man is picked for the role: John Willoughby (lean, humble Gary Cooper of "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town), an ex-bush league ballplayer, due to a bad arm. With Mitchell as his speech scribe, Willoughby becomes an icon of hope to American's common people and the hoax becomes a crusade, with the motto: "Love thy neighbor". However, the motto's ready to be twisted by ogre-like oil magnate, D.B. Norton (Edward Arnold of "You Can't Take It With You" and "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"), who eyes the White House to be conquered by turning by the John Doe movement into a third party. Will Willoughby have the courage and decency to expose Norton while endangering himself? Like other Capra works, "Doe" has the conflict of the little guy fighting the big guy, but this work's deep and honest with that conflict. Capra, to avoid studio interference, formed a temporary studio to finance the film himself. Who could blame him, for the Norton persona is both obviously allegorical (news magnate William Randolph Hearst, Columbia Pictures's co-head Harry Cohn) and prophetic (Rupert Murdoch), with his tactics, politically ambitious and corporate shark-like. Riskin's script is crackerjack, and the actors give it life. Cooper's shy and earnest, matching Stanwyck's boldness and passion. Supporting players are noteworthy; James Gleason's hardboiled as Stanwyck's editor; Cooper's longtime chum Walter Brennan ("The Real McCoys") is a hole-infested misanthropism sack as Willoughby's pal, the Colonel (his "Heelots" speech is funny, sad and thought-provoking); Irving Bacon ("Deeds") provides goofiness as newspaper gopher Beany and Spring Brighton ("Take It") is warm and wise as Ann's mom. Some people today have hijacked elements of Capra's work, emphasizing on moral values while crucifying those who aren't like them. They, like Norton, have forgotten a sense of humility. With humor and drama, "Doe" has that.

    In a attempt to boost profits, publisher Edward Arnold (as D.B. Norton) changes his metropolitan newspaper from "The Bulletin" to "The New Bulletin", and its motto from "A free press for a free people," to "A streamlined newspaper for a streamlined era." Unfortunately, for leggy columnist Barbara Stanwyck (as Ann Mitchell), "streamlining" means she loses her job. Managing editor James Gleason (as Henry Connell) explains Ms. Stanwyck's columns lack "fireworks"; so, she leaves the paper with an explosive last shot - in her final column, Stanwyck makes up a story about a man threatening to commit suicide due to the sad state of world affairs. The man, called "John Doe", vows to jump from the roof of City Hall on Christmas Eve. Stanwyck's story is a sensational circulation booster, and she gets to keep her job. Good thing, as she is supporting an overspending mother (Spring Byington), two girls, and a dog. To keep the story going, Stanwyck and the "Bulletin" hire hobo Gary Cooper (as Long John Willoughby) to play the part of "John Doe" until December 26th; after which, he will be sent packing. A baseball player with a bum arm, Mr. Cooper has been sleeping "under the bridge" with bumming pal Walter Brennan (as "Colonel"). The two men move in to a swanky hotel room, and Mr. Brennan tries to get Mr. Cooper to return to life as his homeless companion. Struggling with the morality of his impersonation, Cooper shocks everyone by contemplating an actual suicidal jump. There are a lot of "swell" Frank Capra touches in the film - especially keep an eye on Brennan, who makes the most of his "tramp" costume. The film is very well directed, and features an outstanding cast of dependable performers. Stanwyck is "Best Actress"-worthy (many of her lead performances are). By the end of 1941, many of the actors herein were nominated for performances in other films - Stanwyck in "Ball of Fire", Copper in "Sergeant York", Brennan in "The Westerner", and Mr. Gleason in "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" - each could have conceivably been nominated for "Meet John Doe". The office boy signaling the opening layoffs (future "Bowery Boy" Benny Bartlett) also portends a wealth of small roles, walk-ons, and bit players. Watch for silent film star Rod La Rocque to shine for the last time, in his well-suited role as Mr. Arnold's nephew "Ted Sheldon ". Cinematographer George Barnes excels, particularly during the last act. The film ends up uneasily celebrating Christianity as the healer of its open, festering wounds. "Meet John Doe" falls in to a worthwhile second tier of Capra productions; he and writer Robert Riskin ended their string of successful collaborations with this one. ******** Meet John Doe (5/3/41) Frank Capra ~ Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyck, Walter Brennan, James Gleason

    Reporter Ann Mitchell gets fired.As a parting shot she writes a fake letter from a unenomployed "John Doe".This nonexistent John Doe threatens to take his own life on Christman Eve as a protest of social ills.The paper has to rehire Ann Mitchell and hire someone to impersonate John Doe.That someone is John Willoughby, also known as Long John, who used to be a baseball player and is now a tramp.He is in desperate need of money to repair his injured arm so that he can play again.So he becomes John Doe.He becomes a national hero, the hero of the common folks.He steps into a diner and the whole place goes all crazy when they find out John Doe is there.The Doe philosophy spreads across the country.It takes a whole new turn, to the worse, when it develops into a political movement.The newspaper's publisher D.B. Norton plans to use Doe as his way into the White House.Meet John Doe (1941) is a Frank Capra movie.Frank Capra's first choice to play John Doe was Gary Cooper, and he got the part.Hardly anybody could do the job better than him.Cooper took the job without even reading the script.He enjoyed his earlier collaboration with Capra five years earlier, and he also wanted to work with Barbara Stanwyck.Stanwyck is the perfect woman to play the role of Ann Mitchell.Edward Arnold is a perfect man to play the villain, Mr. Norton.You have to like Walter Brennan, who plays the tramp friend of John, The Colonel.Spring Byington is marvelous as Ann's mother.James Gleason is great as Henry Connell.Regis Toomey plays the soda jerk Bert Hansen and Ann Doran is Mrs. Hansen.They have been showing his pictures here for the past few weeks and just yesterday I saw this one. is the But This movie is a mixture of harsh realism and optimism.Frank Capra's movies are there to give hope.They are the perfect cure for the cynicism.

    "Meet John Doe" would be the finest movie ever made, in my opinion, except for the ending. Director Frank Capra filmed several different endings, and probably chose the best one, but ultimately found them all lacking in some way. I share his view, but even without a satisfying climax, "Meet John Doe" represents the motion picture industry at its absolute best. Gary Cooper is perfect as Long John Willoughby, a homeless ex-baseball pitcher with a bum arm. Walter Brennan turns in perhaps his greatest role, as "The Colonel," a grumpy fellow who calls people "Healots" and utters the memorable line, "I know the world's been shaved by a drunken barber." Barbara Stanwyck, as always, turns in a compelling performance. Capra invariably supplied his movies with a wealth of strong background characters, and "Meet John Doe" is no exception. Regis Toomey, at one time a leading man in the early talkies, is particularly good as Bert the Soda Jerk. The script sets up one of the most intriguing premises imaginable; reporter Stanwyck, in a bid to save her job and build circulation, invents a character, "John Doe," who threatens to jump off the roof of the highest building in town on Christmas Eve, if people don't start being nicer to each other. His column "I Protest," becomes so popular that the newspaper has to produce an actual "John Doe," and Cooper wins the part. Gradually, the naive, well meaning Cooper begins to believe in what "John Doe" is saying, and falls in love with Stanwyck, who has been co-opted by powerful forces, led by the dastardly Edward Arnold, playing the evil tycoon Norton. James Gleason is great here, as the drunken editor who tries to warn Cooper that Stanwyck is a phony. He's perfect for Capra's type of movie, so it's a surprise that this is the only one he ever appeared in. The drama in this film is everywhere; Cooper's affection for Stanwyck, whose hard boiled heart begins to melt, the burgeoning populist "John Doe" political movement, and the uncertain resolution to "John Doe's" dilemma. As it becomes obvious that people are not going to start treating each other better, the question becomes- will Cooper actually jump on Christmas Eve? Does he still believe in an ideology that Stanwyck created, for dishonest and cynical reasons? "Meet John Doe" features Capra's typical dark look at humanity, as exemplified by Stanwyck's deviousness, and the ugly mob mentality of the "John Doe" supporters as they turn on Cooper. However, again as always, Capra turns that pessimistic view into a fairy tale-like optimism, as Stanwyck comes to believe in Cooper and thus her own philosophy, and the mob realizes realizes the error of its ways. In Capra's films, no matter how extensive the corruption appears, justice always triumphs and the little guy always wins. Thus, it was predictable that Capra would choose the happiest ending possible, with Cooper being saved from jumping at the last minute, by an ill Stanwyck and the mob, represented by Toomis's soda jerk and his wife, as Gleason utters the line, "There you go, Norton- the people! Try and lick that!" I suppose there was really no adequate way to resolve a plot line like this, and Capra did the best he could. Regardless, "Meet John Doe" is head and shoulders above almost any other film Hollywood has ever produced.

    A man needing money (Gary Cooper) agrees to impersonate a nonexistent person who said he would be committing suicide as a protest, and a political movement begins. What a great story of the Great Depression, community, greed, politics, the newspaper business and "helots". I especially love that even if I did not know it was Frank Capra's movie, I would still have figured it out... he just has such an optimistic worldview and a way of making the tragic seem like an opportunity... The film needs a good cleaning up. At least, the version I watched did. Somehow the film escaped Warner Brothers and made it into the public domain. Does a good version exist? Maybe. But it is far easier to find the other versions... and while they are not terrible, there is obviously some aging.

    I highly recommend "Meet John Doe", starring Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Cooper. It's the 1941 predecessor to "It's a Wonderful Life" and the perfect alternative! In fact, I like it 10 times better! Yes, "Meet John Doe" is without a doubt my new favorite movie (excluding my childhood favorite, Mary Martin's Peter Pan, of course), the film I love the best, top' a the list, number one!! I think if you like movies with a message of love, movies that make you smile, those that resonate with human longing, enthusiasm, and reconciliation, you'll love this! And, if you are a Stanwyck fan as I am, this is a must-see! 1941 was a big year for Stanwyck, who starred in three of the most well-received hits of her career-"Meet John Doe", "The Lady Eve", and "Ball of Fire". So successful was this string of movies that they caused Miss Stanwyck's career to hit a high that wouldn't be topped until three years later, with the release of Paramount Pictures' film-noir triumph, "Double Indemnity". Meet John Doe was the second of that 1941 trio of hits, the most heartwarming, and perfect for those of us who are all burnt out on the better known classics.

    I like Frank Capra's films a lot, my favourites being It's a Wonderful Life and Mr Smith goes to Washington. Meet John Doe is not quite a classic for me, but it is still very good. Some of the characters could have done with more colour and the film's messages and warnings while appropriate and relevant do have a tendency to preach. That said, it is gorgeously filmed, Dmitri Tiomkin's score is outstanding, the dialogue is funny, touching and intelligent and the story is moving while having a dark centre to it. Capra does a solid job directing, while there is a divine cast with Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyk and Edward Arnold particularly outstanding. In conclusion, very good if not quite a classic. 8/10 Bethany Cox

Good thing, as she is supporting an overspending mother (Spring Byington), two girls, and a dog. To keep the story going, Stanwyck and the "Bulletin" hire hobo Gary Cooper (as Long John Willoughby) to play the part of "John Doe" until December 26th; after which, he will be sent packing. A baseball player with a bum arm, Mr. Cooper has been sleeping "under the bridge" with bumming pal Walter Brennan (as "Colonel"). The two men move in to a swanky hotel room, and Mr. Brennan tries to get Mr. Cooper to return to life as his homeless companion. Struggling with the morality of his impersonation, Cooper shocks everyone by contemplating an actual suicidal jump. There are a lot of "swell" Frank Capra touches in the film - especially keep an eye on Brennan, who makes the most of his "tramp" costume. The film is very well directed, and features an outstanding cast of dependable performers. Stanwyck is "Best Actress"-worthy (many of her lead performances are). By the end of 1941, many of the actors herein were nominated for performances in other films - Stanwyck in "Ball of Fire", Copper in "Sergeant York", Brennan in "The Westerner", and Mr. Gleason in "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" - each could have conceivably been nominated for "Meet John Doe". The office boy signaling the opening layoffs (future "Bowery Boy" Benny Bartlett) also portends a wealth of small roles, walk-ons, and bit players. Watch for silent film star Rod La Rocque to shine for the last time, in his well-suited role as Mr. Arnold's nephew "Ted Sheldon ". Cinematographer George Barnes excels, particularly during the last act. The film ends up uneasily celebrating Christianity as the healer of its open, festering wounds. "Meet John Doe" falls in to a worthwhile second tier of Capra productions; he and writer Robert Riskin ended their string of successful collaborations with this one. ******** Meet John Doe (5/3/41) Frank Capra ~ Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyck, Walter Brennan, James Gleason

    "Meet John Doe" would be the finest movie ever made, in my opinion, except for the ending. Director Frank Capra filmed several different endings, and probably chose the best one, but ultimately found them all lacking in some way. I share his view, but even without a satisfying climax, "Meet John Doe" represents the motion picture industry at its absolute best. Gary Cooper is perfect as Long John Willoughby, a homeless ex-baseball pitcher with a bum arm. Walter Brennan turns in perhaps his greatest role, as "The Colonel," a grumpy fellow who calls people "Healots" and utters the memorable line, "I know the world's been shaved by a drunken barber." Barbara Stanwyck, as always, turns in a compelling performance. Capra invariably supplied his movies with a wealth of strong background characters, and "Meet John Doe" is no exception. Regis Toomey, at one time a leading man in the early talkies, is particularly good as Bert the Soda Jerk. The script sets up one of the most intriguing premises imaginable; reporter Stanwyck, in a bid to save her job and build circulation, invents a character, "John Doe," who threatens to jump off the roof of the highest building in town on Christmas Eve, if people don't start being nicer to each other. His column "I Protest," becomes so popular that the newspaper has to produce an actual "John Doe," and Cooper wins the part. Gradually, the naive, well meaning Cooper begins to believe in what "John Doe" is saying, and falls in love with Stanwyck, who has been co-opted by powerful forces, led by the dastardly Edward Arnold, playing the evil tycoon Norton. James Gleason is great here, as the drunken editor who tries to warn Cooper that Stanwyck is a phony. He's perfect for Capra's type of movie, so it's a surprise that this is the only one he ever appeared in. The drama in this film is everywhere; Cooper's affection for Stanwyck, whose hard boiled heart begins to melt, the burgeoning populist "John Doe" political movement, and the uncertain resolution to "John Doe's" dilemma. As it becomes obvious that people are not going to start treating each other better, the question becomes- will Cooper actually jump on Christmas Eve? Does he still believe in an ideology that Stanwyck created, for dishonest and cynical reasons? "Meet John Doe" features Capra's typical dark look at humanity, as exemplified by Stanwyck's deviousness, and the ugly mob mentality of the "John Doe" supporters as they turn on Cooper. However, again as always, Capra turns that pessimistic view into a fairy tale-like optimism, as Stanwyck comes to believe in Cooper and thus her own philosophy, and the mob realizes realizes the error of its ways. In Capra's films, no matter how extensive the corruption appears, justice always triumphs and the little guy always wins. Thus, it was predictable that Capra would choose the happiest ending possible, with Cooper being saved from jumping at the last minute, by an ill Stanwyck and the mob, represented by Toomis's soda jerk and his wife, as Gleason utters the line, "There you go, Norton- the people! Try and lick that!" I suppose there was really no adequate way to resolve a plot line like this, and Capra did the best he could. Regardless, "Meet John Doe" is head and shoulders above almost any other film Hollywood has ever produced.

    A man needing money (Gary Cooper) agrees to impersonate a nonexistent person who said he would be committing suicide as a protest, and a political movement begins. What a great story of the Great Depression, community, greed, politics, the newspaper business and "helots". I especially love that even if I did not know it was Frank Capra's movie, I would still have figured it out... he just has such an optimistic worldview and a way of making the tragic seem like an opportunity... The film needs a good cleaning up. At least, the version I watched did. Somehow the film escaped Warner Brothers and made it into the public domain. Does a good version exist? Maybe. But it is far easier to find the other versions... and while they are not terrible, there is obviously some aging.

    I highly recommend "Meet John Doe", starring Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Cooper. It's the 1941 predecessor to "It's a Wonderful Life" and the perfect alternative! In fact, I like it 10 times better! Yes, "Meet John Doe" is without a doubt my new favorite movie (excluding my childhood favorite, Mary Martin's Peter Pan, of course), the film I love the best, top' a the list, number one!! I think if you like movies with a message of love, movies that make you smile, those that resonate with human longing, enthusiasm, and reconciliation, you'll love this! And, if you are a Stanwyck fan as I am, this is a must-see! 1941 was a big year for Stanwyck, who starred in three of the most well-received hits of her career-"Meet John Doe", "The Lady Eve", and "Ball of Fire". So successful was this string of movies that they caused Miss Stanwyck's career to hit a high that wouldn't be topped until three years later, with the release of Paramount Pictures' film-noir triumph, "Double Indemnity". Meet John Doe was the second of that 1941 trio of hits, the most heartwarming, and perfect for those of us who are all burnt out on the better known classics.

    I like Frank Capra's films a lot, my favourites being It's a Wonderful Life and Mr Smith goes to Washington. Meet John Doe is not quite a classic for me, but it is still very good. Some of the characters could have done with more colour and the film's messages and warnings while appropriate and relevant do have a tendency to preach. That said, it is gorgeously filmed, Dmitri Tiomkin's score is outstanding, the dialogue is funny, touching and intelligent and the story is moving while having a dark centre to it. Capra does a solid job directing, while there is a divine cast with Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyk and Edward Arnold particularly outstanding. In conclusion, very good if not quite a classic. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Gary Cooper is the pigeon set up by crooked politician Edward Arnold to embody the downtrodden Everyman: friendless, out of work, suicidal; but after the public overwhelmingly responds to 'John Doe' and his wholesome pleas to love thy neighbor, Cooper realizes he's been duped and the politico threatens to expose him as a fraud. Preachy, though well-acted drama about the fickle heart of humanity leads to woebegone conclusion which no one behind the camera was quite satisfied with. The original story from Richard Connell and Robert Presnell was nominated for an Oscar, but only in the film's vibrant first-half do we get a sense of something fresh and exciting happening. Director Frank Capra once again settles for sentiment over substance. ** from ****

    This movie couldn't be more salient and relevant to our times. The "John Doe Clubs" had the appearance of embodying the disgruntled sentiments of the "Little Man", just like the "Tea Party Movement" today (which one quipster rightly has called "an exercise in mass false consciousness"). These movements of the "little man" have a long history in the US and Europe (in the US, the "Know-Nothings" of the 1850s & Father Coughlin of the 1930s, in France, the "Poujadistes", in Italy the "Qualunquisti"); and all of them end up diverting attention away from the real enemies of little people, the fat cats at the top--in Capra's movie wonderfully incarnated in Edward Arnold's character, D.B.Norton (the real-life counterparts today to D.B. Norton, and who've done a fab job of manipulating "the little people", are the Koch brothers). Capra rightly sensed that the little man's rage at being buffeted about by forces bigger than himself was exploited by the fascist movements of Europe to create right-wing mass parties which, in the end, served to protect the privileges of the wealthiest social classes from revolutionary egalitarian movements.

    It always seemed to me that Capra's dark allegory against fascism has been unfairly overlooked down the years in favour of the more celebrated "Mr" films "Deeds" and "Smith" as well of course as the universally loved "It's A Wonderful Life". It could be just down to it having had a lower circulation down the years (you rarely see it on TV schedules, at least here in the UK), or its war-time genesis, or just that it has a less clearly defined happy ending than its three siblings, but for me there's no question that it fully punches its weight and continues to do so almost 70 years since its release. "Capra-corn" cynics may again mock the director's seemingly simplistic take on the malleability and simplicity of the American public at large, which here sees them swallow whole self-serving journalist Barbara Stanwyck's phony story about an "everyman" so disenchanted with the selfishness of society that he will make a suicidal sacrifice of himself on Christmas Eve to drive home his point. When she produces a stooge to actually play the part (Cooper's vagrant, baseball-loving Long John Willoughby) his scripted "John Doe" idealism strikes home in Anytown USA, fanned by Stanwyck's initially manipulative and no less cynical newspaper editor James Gleason. So far so good. However the the cause takes an altogether darker turn when it's later taken up by would-be dictator Edmund Arnold's sinister megalomaniac magnate DB Norton and his acolytes of faceless power-sharers. The initial scene where we are introduced to Norton, with a high-power display of motorcycle riders seems to these eyes a premonition of the way that today's dictators invariably preside over displays of their war machinery, usually at May Day parades. The more things change... The movie brilliantly takes us on the respective journeys of all these major characters to self-awareness at the same time making its bigger point about the dangers of state control (a rallying call against the rise of fascism engulfing war-torn Europe at the time of the movie's creation) with great subtlety and conviction. I've read that Capra agonised over a suitable ending for the movie and balk a little myself at the perhaps over-zealous religious symbolism of Cooper's character as a Christ-like figure, rebuffed as a prophet in his own time, turned on by the mob and walking towards self-destruction on Christmas eve. That said, some fantastic acting by Cooper and superb direction by Capra at the climactic scene held enough sway for me to trust the outcome as seen. Capra as ever, deftly handles his actors, prising superb performances from Arnold, Stanwyck, Gleason and Walter Brennan (as Willoughby's vagrant chum, the only one to see through the emperor's new clothes with his humorous "Helots" pronouncements) and especially Cooper who progresses his trademark gawky, bumbling sub-Deeds "average-Joe" character to someone altogether more complex and real by the finish. The cinematography too, is great, particularly in evidence at the pivotal mob scene where Capra again displays his mastery of editing and crowd control. I'd forgotten the tie-in to Christmas at the finale and was glad that I was watching a movie at this time with a weightier message than most every other film of this festive season (even as I appreciate it was initially released in May of 1941!). On the DVD mini-focus on Capra, he's described at one point as a 20th Century Dickens. Taking into account the quality of the peak of his work from "It Happened One Night" in 1934 through to "State Of The Union" in 1948 (with "Meet John Doe" at the epicentre both episodically and fundamentally) I firmly believe he deserves this "timeless" accolade more than any other director I can think of.

    Three Oscars and some successful films under his belt, socially-conscious auteur Frank Capra wanted critical acclaim. So, using a news article that's been in development hell since the 1920s as inspiration, he and scribe pal Bob Riskin composed "Meet John Doe", a tale that's an earnest testament to the common man. A newspaper, the Bulletin, is bought by an oil company. People are sacked, including ambitious reporter Ann Mitchell (spunky, sweet Barbara Stanwyck). Worried about her mom and two kid sisters, Mitchell quickly gets her job back by writing a phony letter, by a "John Doe" who plans to kill himself on Christmas Eve because he's frustrated with the "cold, cruel world", increasing the paper's profits. Derelicts flood the paper's officers, claiming to be the writer, after hearing prospects of getting food and a job. Only one man is picked for the role: John Willoughby (lean, humble Gary Cooper of "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town), an ex-bush league ballplayer, due to a bad arm. With Mitchell as his speech scribe, Willoughby becomes an icon of hope to American's common people and the hoax becomes a crusade, with the motto: "Love thy neighbor". However, the motto's ready to be twisted by ogre-like oil magnate, D.B. Norton (Edward Arnold of "You Can't Take It With You" and "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"), who eyes the White House to be conquered by turning by the John Doe movement into a third party. Will Willoughby have the courage and decency to expose Norton while endangering himself? Like other Capra works, "Doe" has the conflict of the little guy fighting the big guy, but this work's deep and honest with that conflict. Capra, to avoid studio interference, formed a temporary studio to finance the film himself. Who could blame him, for the Norton persona is both obviously allegorical (news magnate William Randolph Hearst, Columbia Pictures's co-head Harry Cohn) and prophetic (Rupert Murdoch), with his tactics, politically ambitious and corporate shark-like. Riskin's script is crackerjack, and the actors give it life. Cooper's shy and earnest, matching Stanwyck's boldness and passion. Supporting players are noteworthy; James Gleason's hardboiled as Stanwyck's editor; Cooper's longtime chum Walter Brennan ("The Real McCoys") is a hole-infested misanthropism sack as Willoughby's pal, the Colonel (his "Heelots" speech is funny, sad and thought-provoking); Irving Bacon ("Deeds") provides goofiness as newspaper gopher Beany and Spring Brighton ("Take It") is warm and wise as Ann's mom. Some people today have hijacked elements of Capra's work, emphasizing on moral values while crucifying those who aren't like them. They, like Norton, have forgotten a sense of humility. With humor and drama, "Doe" has that.

    In a attempt to boost profits, publisher Edward Arnold (as D.B. Norton) changes his metropolitan newspaper from "The Bulletin" to "The New Bulletin", and its motto from "A free press for a free people," to "A streamlined newspaper for a streamlined era." Unfortunately, for leggy columnist Barbara Stanwyck (as Ann Mitchell), "streamlining" means she loses her job. Managing editor James Gleason (as Henry Connell) explains Ms. Stanwyck's columns lack "fireworks"; so, she leaves the paper with an explosive last shot - in her final column, Stanwyck makes up a story about a man threatening to commit suicide due to the sad state of world affairs. The man, called "John Doe", vows to jump from the roof of City Hall on Christmas Eve. Stanwyck's story is a sensational circulation booster, and she gets to keep her job. Good thing, as she is supporting an overspending mother (Spring Byington), two girls, and a dog. To keep the story going, Stanwyck and the "Bulletin" hire hobo Gary Cooper (as Long John Willoughby) to play the part of "John Doe" until December 26th; after which, he will be sent packing. A baseball player with a bum arm, Mr. Cooper has been sleeping "under the bridge" with bumming pal Walter Brennan (as "Colonel"). The two men move in to a swanky hotel room, and Mr. Brennan tries to get Mr. Cooper to return to life as his homeless companion. Struggling with the morality of his impersonation, Cooper shocks everyone by contemplating an actual suicidal jump. There are a lot of "swell" Frank Capra touches in the film - especially keep an eye on Brennan, who makes the most of his "tramp" costume. The film is very well directed, and features an outstanding cast of dependable performers. Stanwyck is "Best Actress"-worthy (many of her lead performances are).

The office boy signaling the opening layoffs (future "Bowery Boy" Benny Bartlett) also portends a wealth of small roles, walk-ons, and bit players. Watch for silent film star Rod La Rocque to shine for the last time, in his well-suited role as Mr. Arnold's nephew "Ted Sheldon ". Cinematographer George Barnes excels, particularly during the last act. The film ends up uneasily celebrating Christianity as the healer of its open, festering wounds. "Meet John Doe" falls in to a worthwhile second tier of Capra productions; he and writer Robert Riskin ended their string of successful collaborations with this one. ******** Meet John Doe (5/3/41) Frank Capra ~ Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyck, Walter Brennan, James Gleason

And, if you are a Stanwyck fan as I am, this is a must-see! 1941 was a big year for Stanwyck, who starred in three of the most well-received hits of her career-"Meet John Doe", "The Lady Eve", and "Ball of Fire". So successful was this string of movies that they caused Miss Stanwyck's career to hit a high that wouldn't be topped until three years later, with the release of Paramount Pictures' film-noir triumph, "Double Indemnity". Meet John Doe was the second of that 1941 trio of hits, the most heartwarming, and perfect for those of us who are all burnt out on the better known classics.

    I like Frank Capra's films a lot, my favourites being It's a Wonderful Life and Mr Smith goes to Washington. Meet John Doe is not quite a classic for me, but it is still very good. Some of the characters could have done with more colour and the film's messages and warnings while appropriate and relevant do have a tendency to preach. That said, it is gorgeously filmed, Dmitri Tiomkin's score is outstanding, the dialogue is funny, touching and intelligent and the story is moving while having a dark centre to it. Capra does a solid job directing, while there is a divine cast with Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyk and Edward Arnold particularly outstanding. In conclusion, very good if not quite a classic. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Gary Cooper is the pigeon set up by crooked politician Edward Arnold to embody the downtrodden Everyman: friendless, out of work, suicidal; but after the public overwhelmingly responds to 'John Doe' and his wholesome pleas to love thy neighbor, Cooper realizes he's been duped and the politico threatens to expose him as a fraud. Preachy, though well-acted drama about the fickle heart of humanity leads to woebegone conclusion which no one behind the camera was quite satisfied with. The original story from Richard Connell and Robert Presnell was nominated for an Oscar, but only in the film's vibrant first-half do we get a sense of something fresh and exciting happening. Director Frank Capra once again settles for sentiment over substance. ** from ****

    This movie couldn't be more salient and relevant to our times. The "John Doe Clubs" had the appearance of embodying the disgruntled sentiments of the "Little Man", just like the "Tea Party Movement" today (which one quipster rightly has called "an exercise in mass false consciousness"). These movements of the "little man" have a long history in the US and Europe (in the US, the "Know-Nothings" of the 1850s & Father Coughlin of the 1930s, in France, the "Poujadistes", in Italy the "Qualunquisti"); and all of them end up diverting attention away from the real enemies of little people, the fat cats at the top--in Capra's movie wonderfully incarnated in Edward Arnold's character, D.B.Norton (the real-life counterparts today to D.B. Norton, and who've done a fab job of manipulating "the little people", are the Koch brothers). Capra rightly sensed that the little man's rage at being buffeted about by forces bigger than himself was exploited by the fascist movements of Europe to create right-wing mass parties which, in the end, served to protect the privileges of the wealthiest social classes from revolutionary egalitarian movements.

    It always seemed to me that Capra's dark allegory against fascism has been unfairly overlooked down the years in favour of the more celebrated "Mr" films "Deeds" and "Smith" as well of course as the universally loved "It's A Wonderful Life". It could be just down to it having had a lower circulation down the years (you rarely see it on TV schedules, at least here in the UK), or its war-time genesis, or just that it has a less clearly defined happy ending than its three siblings, but for me there's no question that it fully punches its weight and continues to do so almost 70 years since its release. "Capra-corn" cynics may again mock the director's seemingly simplistic take on the malleability and simplicity of the American public at large, which here sees them swallow whole self-serving journalist Barbara Stanwyck's phony story about an "everyman" so disenchanted with the selfishness of society that he will make a suicidal sacrifice of himself on Christmas Eve to drive home his point. When she produces a stooge to actually play the part (Cooper's vagrant, baseball-loving Long John Willoughby) his scripted "John Doe" idealism strikes home in Anytown USA, fanned by Stanwyck's initially manipulative and no less cynical newspaper editor James Gleason. So far so good. However the the cause takes an altogether darker turn when it's later taken up by would-be dictator Edmund Arnold's sinister megalomaniac magnate DB Norton and his acolytes of faceless power-sharers. The initial scene where we are introduced to Norton, with a high-power display of motorcycle riders seems to these eyes a premonition of the way that today's dictators invariably preside over displays of their war machinery, usually at May Day parades. The more things change... The movie brilliantly takes us on the respective journeys of all these major characters to self-awareness at the same time making its bigger point about the dangers of state control (a rallying call against the rise of fascism engulfing war-torn Europe at the time of the movie's creation) with great subtlety and conviction. I've read that Capra agonised over a suitable ending for the movie and balk a little myself at the perhaps over-zealous religious symbolism of Cooper's character as a Christ-like figure, rebuffed as a prophet in his own time, turned on by the mob and walking towards self-destruction on Christmas eve. That said, some fantastic acting by Cooper and superb direction by Capra at the climactic scene held enough sway for me to trust the outcome as seen. Capra as ever, deftly handles his actors, prising superb performances from Arnold, Stanwyck, Gleason and Walter Brennan (as Willoughby's vagrant chum, the only one to see through the emperor's new clothes with his humorous "Helots" pronouncements) and especially Cooper who progresses his trademark gawky, bumbling sub-Deeds "average-Joe" character to someone altogether more complex and real by the finish. The cinematography too, is great, particularly in evidence at the pivotal mob scene where Capra again displays his mastery of editing and crowd control. I'd forgotten the tie-in to Christmas at the finale and was glad that I was watching a movie at this time with a weightier message than most every other film of this festive season (even as I appreciate it was initially released in May of 1941!). On the DVD mini-focus on Capra, he's described at one point as a 20th Century Dickens. Taking into account the quality of the peak of his work from "It Happened One Night" in 1934 through to "State Of The Union" in 1948 (with "Meet John Doe" at the epicentre both episodically and fundamentally) I firmly believe he deserves this "timeless" accolade more than any other director I can think of.

    Three Oscars and some successful films under his belt, socially-conscious auteur Frank Capra wanted critical acclaim. So, using a news article that's been in development hell since the 1920s as inspiration, he and scribe pal Bob Riskin composed "Meet John Doe", a tale that's an earnest testament to the common man. A newspaper, the Bulletin, is bought by an oil company. People are sacked, including ambitious reporter Ann Mitchell (spunky, sweet Barbara Stanwyck). Worried about her mom and two kid sisters, Mitchell quickly gets her job back by writing a phony letter, by a "John Doe" who plans to kill himself on Christmas Eve because he's frustrated with the "cold, cruel world", increasing the paper's profits. Derelicts flood the paper's officers, claiming to be the writer, after hearing prospects of getting food and a job. Only one man is picked for the role: John Willoughby (lean, humble Gary Cooper of "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town), an ex-bush league ballplayer, due to a bad arm. With Mitchell as his speech scribe, Willoughby becomes an icon of hope to American's common people and the hoax becomes a crusade, with the motto: "Love thy neighbor". However, the motto's ready to be twisted by ogre-like oil magnate, D.B. Norton (Edward Arnold of "You Can't Take It With You" and "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"), who eyes the White House to be conquered by turning by the John Doe movement into a third party. Will Willoughby have the courage and decency to expose Norton while endangering himself? Like other Capra works, "Doe" has the conflict of the little guy fighting the big guy, but this work's deep and honest with that conflict. Capra, to avoid studio interference, formed a temporary studio to finance the film himself. Who could blame him, for the Norton persona is both obviously allegorical (news magnate William Randolph Hearst, Columbia Pictures's co-head Harry Cohn) and prophetic (Rupert Murdoch), with his tactics, politically ambitious and corporate shark-like. Riskin's script is crackerjack, and the actors give it life. Cooper's shy and earnest, matching Stanwyck's boldness and passion. Supporting players are noteworthy; James Gleason's hardboiled as Stanwyck's editor; Cooper's longtime chum Walter Brennan ("The Real McCoys") is a hole-infested misanthropism sack as Willoughby's pal, the Colonel (his "Heelots" speech is funny, sad and thought-provoking); Irving Bacon ("Deeds") provides goofiness as newspaper gopher Beany and Spring Brighton ("Take It") is warm and wise as Ann's mom. Some people today have hijacked elements of Capra's work, emphasizing on moral values while crucifying those who aren't like them. They, like Norton, have forgotten a sense of humility. With humor and drama, "Doe" has that.

    In a attempt to boost profits, publisher Edward Arnold (as D.B. Norton) changes his metropolitan newspaper from "The Bulletin" to "The New Bulletin", and its motto from "A free press for a free people," to "A streamlined newspaper for a streamlined era." Unfortunately, for leggy columnist Barbara Stanwyck (as Ann Mitchell), "streamlining" means she loses her job. Managing editor James Gleason (as Henry Connell) explains Ms. Stanwyck's columns lack "fireworks"; so, she leaves the paper with an explosive last shot - in her final column, Stanwyck makes up a story about a man threatening to commit suicide due to the sad state of world affairs. The man, called "John Doe", vows to jump from the roof of City Hall on Christmas Eve. Stanwyck's story is a sensational circulation booster, and she gets to keep her job. Good thing, as she is supporting an overspending mother (Spring Byington), two girls, and a dog. To keep the story going, Stanwyck and the "Bulletin" hire hobo Gary Cooper (as Long John Willoughby) to play the part of "John Doe" until December 26th; after which, he will be sent packing. A baseball player with a bum arm, Mr. Cooper has been sleeping "under the bridge" with bumming pal Walter Brennan (as "Colonel"). The two men move in to a swanky hotel room, and Mr. Brennan tries to get Mr. Cooper to return to life as his homeless companion. Struggling with the morality of his impersonation, Cooper shocks everyone by contemplating an actual suicidal jump. There are a lot of "swell" Frank Capra touches in the film - especially keep an eye on Brennan, who makes the most of his "tramp" costume. The film is very well directed, and features an outstanding cast of dependable performers. Stanwyck is "Best Actress"-worthy (many of her lead performances are). By the end of 1941, many of the actors herein were nominated for performances in other films - Stanwyck in "Ball of Fire", Copper in "Sergeant York", Brennan in "The Westerner", and Mr. Gleason in "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" - each could have conceivably been nominated for "Meet John Doe". The office boy signaling the opening layoffs (future "Bowery Boy" Benny Bartlett) also portends a wealth of small roles, walk-ons, and bit players. Watch for silent film star Rod La Rocque to shine for the last time, in his well-suited role as Mr. Arnold's nephew "Ted Sheldon ". Cinematographer George Barnes excels, particularly during the last act. The film ends up uneasily celebrating Christianity as the healer of its open, festering wounds. "Meet John Doe" falls in to a worthwhile second tier of Capra productions; he and writer Robert Riskin ended their string of successful collaborations with this one. ******** Meet John Doe (5/3/41) Frank Capra ~ Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyck, Walter Brennan, James Gleason

    Reporter Ann Mitchell gets fired.As a parting shot she writes a fake letter from a unenomployed "John Doe".This nonexistent John Doe threatens to take his own life on Christman Eve as a protest of social ills.The paper has to rehire Ann Mitchell and hire someone to impersonate John Doe.That someone is John Willoughby, also known as Long John, who used to be a baseball player and is now a tramp.He is in desperate need of money to repair his injured arm so that he can play again.So he becomes John Doe.He becomes a national hero, the hero of the common folks.He steps into a diner and the whole place goes all crazy when they find out John Doe is there.The Doe philosophy spreads across the country.It takes a whole new turn, to the worse, when it develops into a political movement.The newspaper's publisher D.B. Norton plans to use Doe as his way into the White House.Meet John Doe (1941) is a Frank Capra movie.Frank Capra's first choice to play John Doe was Gary Cooper, and he got the part.Hardly anybody could do the job better than him.Cooper took the job without even reading the script.He enjoyed his earlier collaboration with Capra five years earlier, and he also wanted to work with Barbara Stanwyck.Stanwyck is the perfect woman to play the role of Ann Mitchell.Edward Arnold is a perfect man to play the villain, Mr. Norton.You have to like Walter Brennan, who plays the tramp friend of John, The Colonel.Spring Byington is marvelous as Ann's mother.James Gleason is great as Henry Connell.Regis Toomey plays the soda jerk Bert Hansen and Ann Doran is Mrs. Hansen.They have been showing his pictures here for the past few weeks and just yesterday I saw this one. is the But This movie is a mixture of harsh realism and optimism.Frank Capra's movies are there to give hope.They are the perfect cure for the cynicism.

    "Meet John Doe" would be the finest movie ever made, in my opinion, except for the ending. Director Frank Capra filmed several different endings, and probably chose the best one, but ultimately found them all lacking in some way. I share his view, but even without a satisfying climax, "Meet John Doe" represents the motion picture industry at its absolute best. Gary Cooper is perfect as Long John Willoughby, a homeless ex-baseball pitcher with a bum arm. Walter Brennan turns in perhaps his greatest role, as "The Colonel," a grumpy fellow who calls people "Healots" and utters the memorable line, "I know the world's been shaved by a drunken barber." Barbara Stanwyck, as always, turns in a compelling performance. Capra invariably supplied his movies with a wealth of strong background characters, and "Meet John Doe" is no exception. Regis Toomey, at one time a leading man in the early talkies, is particularly good as Bert the Soda Jerk. The script sets up one of the most intriguing premises imaginable; reporter Stanwyck, in a bid to save her job and build circulation, invents a character, "John Doe," who threatens to jump off the roof of the highest building in town on Christmas Eve, if people don't start being nicer to each other. His column "I Protest," becomes so popular that the newspaper has to produce an actual "John Doe," and Cooper wins the part. Gradually, the naive, well meaning Cooper begins to believe in what "John Doe" is saying, and falls in love with Stanwyck, who has been co-opted by powerful forces, led by the dastardly Edward Arnold, playing the evil tycoon Norton. James Gleason is great here, as the drunken editor who tries to warn Cooper that Stanwyck is a phony. He's perfect for Capra's type of movie, so it's a surprise that this is the only one he ever appeared in. The drama in this film is everywhere; Cooper's affection for Stanwyck, whose hard boiled heart begins to melt, the burgeoning populist "John Doe" political movement, and the uncertain resolution to "John Doe's" dilemma. As it becomes obvious that people are not going to start treating each other better, the question becomes- will Cooper actually jump on Christmas Eve? Does he still believe in an ideology that Stanwyck created, for dishonest and cynical reasons? "Meet John Doe" features Capra's typical dark look at humanity, as exemplified by Stanwyck's deviousness, and the ugly mob mentality of the "John Doe" supporters as they turn on Cooper. However, again as always, Capra turns that pessimistic view into a fairy tale-like optimism, as Stanwyck comes to believe in Cooper and thus her own philosophy, and the mob realizes realizes the error of its ways. In Capra's films, no matter how extensive the corruption appears, justice always triumphs and the little guy always wins. Thus, it was predictable that Capra would choose the happiest ending possible, with Cooper being saved from jumping at the last minute, by an ill Stanwyck and the mob, represented by Toomis's soda jerk and his wife, as Gleason utters the line, "There you go, Norton- the people! Try and lick that!" I suppose there was really no adequate way to resolve a plot line like this, and Capra did the best he could. Regardless, "Meet John Doe" is head and shoulders above almost any other film Hollywood has ever produced.

    A man needing money (Gary Cooper) agrees to impersonate a nonexistent person who said he would be committing suicide as a protest, and a political movement begins. What a great story of the Great Depression, community, greed, politics, the newspaper business and "helots". I especially love that even if I did not know it was Frank Capra's movie, I would still have figured it out... he just has such an optimistic worldview and a way of making the tragic seem like an opportunity... The film needs a good cleaning up. At least, the version I watched did. Somehow the film escaped Warner Brothers and made it into the public domain. Does a good version exist? Maybe. But it is far easier to find the other versions... and while they are not terrible, there is obviously some aging.

With Mitchell as his speech scribe, Willoughby becomes an icon of hope to American's common people and the hoax becomes a crusade, with the motto: "Love thy neighbor".

Will Willoughby have the courage and decency to expose Norton while endangering himself? Like other Capra works, "Doe" has the conflict of the little guy fighting the big guy, but this work's deep and honest with that conflict. Capra, to avoid studio interference, formed a temporary studio to finance the film himself. Who could blame him, for the Norton persona is both obviously allegorical (news magnate William Randolph Hearst, Columbia Pictures's co-head Harry Cohn) and prophetic (Rupert Murdoch), with his tactics, politically ambitious and corporate shark-like. Riskin's script is crackerjack, and the actors give it life. Cooper's shy and earnest, matching Stanwyck's boldness and passion. Supporting players are noteworthy; James Gleason's hardboiled as Stanwyck's editor; Cooper's longtime chum Walter Brennan ("The Real McCoys") is a hole-infested misanthropism sack as Willoughby's pal, the Colonel (his "Heelots" speech is funny, sad and thought-provoking); Irving Bacon ("Deeds") provides goofiness as newspaper gopher Beany and Spring Brighton ("Take It") is warm and wise as Ann's mom. Some people today have hijacked elements of Capra's work, emphasizing on moral values while crucifying those who aren't like them. They, like Norton, have forgotten a sense of humility. With humor and drama, "Doe" has that.

    In a attempt to boost profits, publisher Edward Arnold (as D.B. Norton) changes his metropolitan newspaper from "The Bulletin" to "The New Bulletin", and its motto from "A free press for a free people," to "A streamlined newspaper for a streamlined era." Unfortunately, for leggy columnist Barbara Stanwyck (as Ann Mitchell), "streamlining" means she loses her job. Managing editor James Gleason (as Henry Connell) explains Ms. Stanwyck's columns lack "fireworks"; so, she leaves the paper with an explosive last shot - in her final column, Stanwyck makes up a story about a man threatening to commit suicide due to the sad state of world affairs. The man, called "John Doe", vows to jump from the roof of City Hall on Christmas Eve. Stanwyck's story is a sensational circulation booster, and she gets to keep her job. Good thing, as she is supporting an overspending mother (Spring Byington), two girls, and a dog. To keep the story going, Stanwyck and the "Bulletin" hire hobo Gary Cooper (as Long John Willoughby) to play the part of "John Doe" until December 26th; after which, he will be sent packing. A baseball player with a bum arm, Mr. Cooper has been sleeping "under the bridge" with bumming pal Walter Brennan (as "Colonel"). The two men move in to a swanky hotel room, and Mr. Brennan tries to get Mr. Cooper to return to life as his homeless companion. Struggling with the morality of his impersonation, Cooper shocks everyone by contemplating an actual suicidal jump. There are a lot of "swell" Frank Capra touches in the film - especially keep an eye on Brennan, who makes the most of his "tramp" costume. The film is very well directed, and features an outstanding cast of dependable performers. Stanwyck is "Best Actress"-worthy (many of her lead performances are). By the end of 1941, many of the actors herein were nominated for performances in other films - Stanwyck in "Ball of Fire", Copper in "Sergeant York", Brennan in "The Westerner", and Mr. Gleason in "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" - each could have conceivably been nominated for "Meet John Doe". The office boy signaling the opening layoffs (future "Bowery Boy" Benny Bartlett) also portends a wealth of small roles, walk-ons, and bit players. Watch for silent film star Rod La Rocque to shine for the last time, in his well-suited role as Mr. Arnold's nephew "Ted Sheldon ". Cinematographer George Barnes excels, particularly during the last act. The film ends up uneasily celebrating Christianity as the healer of its open, festering wounds. "Meet John Doe" falls in to a worthwhile second tier of Capra productions; he and writer Robert Riskin ended their string of successful collaborations with this one. ******** Meet John Doe (5/3/41) Frank Capra ~ Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyck, Walter Brennan, James Gleason

    "Meet John Doe" would be the finest movie ever made, in my opinion, except for the ending. Director Frank Capra filmed several different endings, and probably chose the best one, but ultimately found them all lacking in some way. I share his view, but even without a satisfying climax, "Meet John Doe" represents the motion picture industry at its absolute best. Gary Cooper is perfect as Long John Willoughby, a homeless ex-baseball pitcher with a bum arm. Walter Brennan turns in perhaps his greatest role, as "The Colonel," a grumpy fellow who calls people "Healots" and utters the memorable line, "I know the world's been shaved by a drunken barber." Barbara Stanwyck, as always, turns in a compelling performance. Capra invariably supplied his movies with a wealth of strong background characters, and "Meet John Doe" is no exception. Regis Toomey, at one time a leading man in the early talkies, is particularly good as Bert the Soda Jerk. The script sets up one of the most intriguing premises imaginable; reporter Stanwyck, in a bid to save her job and build circulation, invents a character, "John Doe," who threatens to jump off the roof of the highest building in town on Christmas Eve, if people don't start being nicer to each other. His column "I Protest," becomes so popular that the newspaper has to produce an actual "John Doe," and Cooper wins the part. Gradually, the naive, well meaning Cooper begins to believe in what "John Doe" is saying, and falls in love with Stanwyck, who has been co-opted by powerful forces, led by the dastardly Edward Arnold, playing the evil tycoon Norton. James Gleason is great here, as the drunken editor who tries to warn Cooper that Stanwyck is a phony. He's perfect for Capra's type of movie, so it's a surprise that this is the only one he ever appeared in. The drama in this film is everywhere; Cooper's affection for Stanwyck, whose hard boiled heart begins to melt, the burgeoning populist "John Doe" political movement, and the uncertain resolution to "John Doe's" dilemma. As it becomes obvious that people are not going to start treating each other better, the question becomes- will Cooper actually jump on Christmas Eve? Does he still believe in an ideology that Stanwyck created, for dishonest and cynical reasons? "Meet John Doe" features Capra's typical dark look at humanity, as exemplified by Stanwyck's deviousness, and the ugly mob mentality of the "John Doe" supporters as they turn on Cooper. However, again as always, Capra turns that pessimistic view into a fairy tale-like optimism, as Stanwyck comes to believe in Cooper and thus her own philosophy, and the mob realizes realizes the error of its ways. In Capra's films, no matter how extensive the corruption appears, justice always triumphs and the little guy always wins. Thus, it was predictable that Capra would choose the happiest ending possible, with Cooper being saved from jumping at the last minute, by an ill Stanwyck and the mob, represented by Toomis's soda jerk and his wife, as Gleason utters the line, "There you go, Norton- the people! Try and lick that!" I suppose there was really no adequate way to resolve a plot line like this, and Capra did the best he could. Regardless, "Meet John Doe" is head and shoulders above almost any other film Hollywood has ever produced.

    A man needing money (Gary Cooper) agrees to impersonate a nonexistent person who said he would be committing suicide as a protest, and a political movement begins. What a great story of the Great Depression, community, greed, politics, the newspaper business and "helots". I especially love that even if I did not know it was Frank Capra's movie, I would still have figured it out... he just has such an optimistic worldview and a way of making the tragic seem like an opportunity... The film needs a good cleaning up. At least, the version I watched did. Somehow the film escaped Warner Brothers and made it into the public domain. Does a good version exist? Maybe. But it is far easier to find the other versions... and while they are not terrible, there is obviously some aging.

    I highly recommend "Meet John Doe", starring Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Cooper. It's the 1941 predecessor to "It's a Wonderful Life" and the perfect alternative! In fact, I like it 10 times better! Yes, "Meet John Doe" is without a doubt my new favorite movie (excluding my childhood favorite, Mary Martin's Peter Pan, of course), the film I love the best, top' a the list, number one!! I think if you like movies with a message of love, movies that make you smile, those that resonate with human longing, enthusiasm, and reconciliation, you'll love this! And, if you are a Stanwyck fan as I am, this is a must-see! 1941 was a big year for Stanwyck, who starred in three of the most well-received hits of her career-"Meet John Doe", "The Lady Eve", and "Ball of Fire". So successful was this string of movies that they caused Miss Stanwyck's career to hit a high that wouldn't be topped until three years later, with the release of Paramount Pictures' film-noir triumph, "Double Indemnity". Meet John Doe was the second of that 1941 trio of hits, the most heartwarming, and perfect for those of us who are all burnt out on the better known classics.

    I like Frank Capra's films a lot, my favourites being It's a Wonderful Life and Mr Smith goes to Washington. Meet John Doe is not quite a classic for me, but it is still very good. Some of the characters could have done with more colour and the film's messages and warnings while appropriate and relevant do have a tendency to preach. That said, it is gorgeously filmed, Dmitri Tiomkin's score is outstanding, the dialogue is funny, touching and intelligent and the story is moving while having a dark centre to it. Capra does a solid job directing, while there is a divine cast with Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyk and Edward Arnold particularly outstanding. In conclusion, very good if not quite a classic. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Gary Cooper is the pigeon set up by crooked politician Edward Arnold to embody the downtrodden Everyman: friendless, out of work, suicidal; but after the public overwhelmingly responds to 'John Doe' and his wholesome pleas to love thy neighbor, Cooper realizes he's been duped and the politico threatens to expose him as a fraud. Preachy, though well-acted drama about the fickle heart of humanity leads to woebegone conclusion which no one behind the camera was quite satisfied with. The original story from Richard Connell and Robert Presnell was nominated for an Oscar, but only in the film's vibrant first-half do we get a sense of something fresh and exciting happening. Director Frank Capra once again settles for sentiment over substance. ** from ****

    This movie couldn't be more salient and relevant to our times. The "John Doe Clubs" had the appearance of embodying the disgruntled sentiments of the "Little Man", just like the "Tea Party Movement" today (which one quipster rightly has called "an exercise in mass false consciousness"). These movements of the "little man" have a long history in the US and Europe (in the US, the "Know-Nothings" of the 1850s & Father Coughlin of the 1930s, in France, the "Poujadistes", in Italy the "Qualunquisti"); and all of them end up diverting attention away from the real enemies of little people, the fat cats at the top--in Capra's movie wonderfully incarnated in Edward Arnold's character, D.B.Norton (the real-life counterparts today to D.B. Norton, and who've done a fab job of manipulating "the little people", are the Koch brothers). Capra rightly sensed that the little man's rage at being buffeted about by forces bigger than himself was exploited by the fascist movements of Europe to create right-wing mass parties which, in the end, served to protect the privileges of the wealthiest social classes from revolutionary egalitarian movements.

    It always seemed to me that Capra's dark allegory against fascism has been unfairly overlooked down the years in favour of the more celebrated "Mr" films "Deeds" and "Smith" as well of course as the universally loved "It's A Wonderful Life". It could be just down to it having had a lower circulation down the years (you rarely see it on TV schedules, at least here in the UK), or its war-time genesis, or just that it has a less clearly defined happy ending than its three siblings, but for me there's no question that it fully punches its weight and continues to do so almost 70 years since its release. "Capra-corn" cynics may again mock the director's seemingly simplistic take on the malleability and simplicity of the American public at large, which here sees them swallow whole self-serving journalist Barbara Stanwyck's phony story about an "everyman" so disenchanted with the selfishness of society that he will make a suicidal sacrifice of himself on Christmas Eve to drive home his point. When she produces a stooge to actually play the part (Cooper's vagrant, baseball-loving Long John Willoughby) his scripted "John Doe" idealism strikes home in Anytown USA, fanned by Stanwyck's initially manipulative and no less cynical newspaper editor James Gleason. So far so good. However the the cause takes an altogether darker turn when it's later taken up by would-be dictator Edmund Arnold's sinister megalomaniac magnate DB Norton and his acolytes of faceless power-sharers. The initial scene where we are introduced to Norton, with a high-power display of motorcycle riders seems to these eyes a premonition of the way that today's dictators invariably preside over displays of their war machinery, usually at May Day parades. The more things change... The movie brilliantly takes us on the respective journeys of all these major characters to self-awareness at the same time making its bigger point about the dangers of state control (a rallying call against the rise of fascism engulfing war-torn Europe at the time of the movie's creation) with great subtlety and conviction. I've read that Capra agonised over a suitable ending for the movie and balk a little myself at the perhaps over-zealous religious symbolism of Cooper's character as a Christ-like figure, rebuffed as a prophet in his own time, turned on by the mob and walking towards self-destruction on Christmas eve. That said, some fantastic acting by Cooper and superb direction by Capra at the climactic scene held enough sway for me to trust the outcome as seen. Capra as ever, deftly handles his actors, prising superb performances from Arnold, Stanwyck, Gleason and Walter Brennan (as Willoughby's vagrant chum, the only one to see through the emperor's new clothes with his humorous "Helots" pronouncements) and especially Cooper who progresses his trademark gawky, bumbling sub-Deeds "average-Joe" character to someone altogether more complex and real by the finish. The cinematography too, is great, particularly in evidence at the pivotal mob scene where Capra again displays his mastery of editing and crowd control. I'd forgotten the tie-in to Christmas at the finale and was glad that I was watching a movie at this time with a weightier message than most every other film of this festive season (even as I appreciate it was initially released in May of 1941!). On the DVD mini-focus on Capra, he's described at one point as a 20th Century Dickens. Taking into account the quality of the peak of his work from "It Happened One Night" in 1934 through to "State Of The Union" in 1948 (with "Meet John Doe" at the epicentre both episodically and fundamentally) I firmly believe he deserves this "timeless" accolade more than any other director I can think of.

    Three Oscars and some successful films under his belt, socially-conscious auteur Frank Capra wanted critical acclaim. So, using a news article that's been in development hell since the 1920s as inspiration, he and scribe pal Bob Riskin composed "Meet John Doe", a tale that's an earnest testament to the common man. A newspaper, the Bulletin, is bought by an oil company. People are sacked, including ambitious reporter Ann Mitchell (spunky, sweet Barbara Stanwyck). Worried about her mom and two kid sisters, Mitchell quickly gets her job back by writing a phony letter, by a "John Doe" who plans to kill himself on Christmas Eve because he's frustrated with the "cold, cruel world", increasing the paper's profits. Derelicts flood the paper's officers, claiming to be the writer, after hearing prospects of getting food and a job. Only one man is picked for the role: John Willoughby (lean, humble Gary Cooper of "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town), an ex-bush league ballplayer, due to a bad arm. With Mitchell as his speech scribe, Willoughby becomes an icon of hope to American's common people and the hoax becomes a crusade, with the motto: "Love thy neighbor". However, the motto's ready to be twisted by ogre-like oil magnate, D.B. Norton (Edward Arnold of "You Can't Take It With You" and "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"), who eyes the White House to be conquered by turning by the John Doe movement into a third party. Will Willoughby have the courage and decency to expose Norton while endangering himself? Like other Capra works, "Doe" has the conflict of the little guy fighting the big guy, but this work's deep and honest with that conflict. Capra, to avoid studio interference, formed a temporary studio to finance the film himself. Who could blame him, for the Norton persona is both obviously allegorical (news magnate William Randolph Hearst, Columbia Pictures's co-head Harry Cohn) and prophetic (Rupert Murdoch), with his tactics, politically ambitious and corporate shark-like. Riskin's script is crackerjack, and the actors give it life. Cooper's shy and earnest, matching Stanwyck's boldness and passion. Supporting players are noteworthy; James Gleason's hardboiled as Stanwyck's editor; Cooper's longtime chum Walter Brennan ("The Real McCoys") is a hole-infested misanthropism sack as Willoughby's pal, the Colonel (his "Heelots" speech is funny, sad and thought-provoking); Irving Bacon ("Deeds") provides goofiness as newspaper gopher Beany and Spring Brighton ("Take It") is warm and wise as Ann's mom. Some people today have hijacked elements of Capra's work, emphasizing on moral values while crucifying those who aren't like them. They, like Norton, have forgotten a sense of humility. With humor and drama, "Doe" has that.

    A man needing money (Gary Cooper) agrees to impersonate a nonexistent person who said he would be committing suicide as a protest, and a political movement begins. What a great story of the Great Depression, community, greed, politics, the newspaper business and "helots". I especially love that even if I did not know it was Frank Capra's movie, I would still have figured it out... he just has such an optimistic worldview and a way of making the tragic seem like an opportunity... The film needs a good cleaning up. At least, the version I watched did. Somehow the film escaped Warner Brothers and made it into the public domain. Does a good version exist? Maybe. But it is far easier to find the other versions... and while they are not terrible, there is obviously some aging.

    I highly recommend "Meet John Doe", starring Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Cooper. It's the 1941 predecessor to "It's a Wonderful Life" and the perfect alternative! In fact, I like it 10 times better! Yes, "Meet John Doe" is without a doubt my new favorite movie (excluding my childhood favorite, Mary Martin's Peter Pan, of course), the film I love the best, top' a the list, number one!! I think if you like movies with a message of love, movies that make you smile, those that resonate with human longing, enthusiasm, and reconciliation, you'll love this! And, if you are a Stanwyck fan as I am, this is a must-see! 1941 was a big year for Stanwyck, who starred in three of the most well-received hits of her career-"Meet John Doe", "The Lady Eve", and "Ball of Fire". So successful was this string of movies that they caused Miss Stanwyck's career to hit a high that wouldn't be topped until three years later, with the release of Paramount Pictures' film-noir triumph, "Double Indemnity". Meet John Doe was the second of that 1941 trio of hits, the most heartwarming, and perfect for those of us who are all burnt out on the better known classics.

    I like Frank Capra's films a lot, my favourites being It's a Wonderful Life and Mr Smith goes to Washington. Meet John Doe is not quite a classic for me, but it is still very good. Some of the characters could have done with more colour and the film's messages and warnings while appropriate and relevant do have a tendency to preach. That said, it is gorgeously filmed, Dmitri Tiomkin's score is outstanding, the dialogue is funny, touching and intelligent and the story is moving while having a dark centre to it. Capra does a solid job directing, while there is a divine cast with Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyk and Edward Arnold particularly outstanding. In conclusion, very good if not quite a classic. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Gary Cooper is the pigeon set up by crooked politician Edward Arnold to embody the downtrodden Everyman: friendless, out of work, suicidal; but after the public overwhelmingly responds to 'John Doe' and his wholesome pleas to love thy neighbor, Cooper realizes he's been duped and the politico threatens to expose him as a fraud. Preachy, though well-acted drama about the fickle heart of humanity leads to woebegone conclusion which no one behind the camera was quite satisfied with. The original story from Richard Connell and Robert Presnell was nominated for an Oscar, but only in the film's vibrant first-half do we get a sense of something fresh and exciting happening. Director Frank Capra once again settles for sentiment over substance. ** from ****

    This movie couldn't be more salient and relevant to our times. The "John Doe Clubs" had the appearance of embodying the disgruntled sentiments of the "Little Man", just like the "Tea Party Movement" today (which one quipster rightly has called "an exercise in mass false consciousness"). These movements of the "little man" have a long history in the US and Europe (in the US, the "Know-Nothings" of the 1850s & Father Coughlin of the 1930s, in France, the "Poujadistes", in Italy the "Qualunquisti"); and all of them end up diverting attention away from the real enemies of little people, the fat cats at the top--in Capra's movie wonderfully incarnated in Edward Arnold's character, D.B.Norton (the real-life counterparts today to D.B. Norton, and who've done a fab job of manipulating "the little people", are the Koch brothers). Capra rightly sensed that the little man's rage at being buffeted about by forces bigger than himself was exploited by the fascist movements of Europe to create right-wing mass parties which, in the end, served to protect the privileges of the wealthiest social classes from revolutionary egalitarian movements.

    It always seemed to me that Capra's dark allegory against fascism has been unfairly overlooked down the years in favour of the more celebrated "Mr" films "Deeds" and "Smith" as well of course as the universally loved "It's A Wonderful Life". It could be just down to it having had a lower circulation down the years (you rarely see it on TV schedules, at least here in the UK), or its war-time genesis, or just that it has a less clearly defined happy ending than its three siblings, but for me there's no question that it fully punches its weight and continues to do so almost 70 years since its release. "Capra-corn" cynics may again mock the director's seemingly simplistic take on the malleability and simplicity of the American public at large, which here sees them swallow whole self-serving journalist Barbara Stanwyck's phony story about an "everyman" so disenchanted with the selfishness of society that he will make a suicidal sacrifice of himself on Christmas Eve to drive home his point. When she produces a stooge to actually play the part (Cooper's vagrant, baseball-loving Long John Willoughby) his scripted "John Doe" idealism strikes home in Anytown USA, fanned by Stanwyck's initially manipulative and no less cynical newspaper editor James Gleason. So far so good. However the the cause takes an altogether darker turn when it's later taken up by would-be dictator Edmund Arnold's sinister megalomaniac magnate DB Norton and his acolytes of faceless power-sharers. The initial scene where we are introduced to Norton, with a high-power display of motorcycle riders seems to these eyes a premonition of the way that today's dictators invariably preside over displays of their war machinery, usually at May Day parades. The more things change... The movie brilliantly takes us on the respective journeys of all these major characters to self-awareness at the same time making its bigger point about the dangers of state control (a rallying call against the rise of fascism engulfing war-torn Europe at the time of the movie's creation) with great subtlety and conviction. I've read that Capra agonised over a suitable ending for the movie and balk a little myself at the perhaps over-zealous religious symbolism of Cooper's character as a Christ-like figure, rebuffed as a prophet in his own time, turned on by the mob and walking towards self-destruction on Christmas eve. That said, some fantastic acting by Cooper and superb direction by Capra at the climactic scene held enough sway for me to trust the outcome as seen. Capra as ever, deftly handles his actors, prising superb performances from Arnold, Stanwyck, Gleason and Walter Brennan (as Willoughby's vagrant chum, the only one to see through the emperor's new clothes with his humorous "Helots" pronouncements) and especially Cooper who progresses his trademark gawky, bumbling sub-Deeds "average-Joe" character to someone altogether more complex and real by the finish. The cinematography too, is great, particularly in evidence at the pivotal mob scene where Capra again displays his mastery of editing and crowd control. I'd forgotten the tie-in to Christmas at the finale and was glad that I was watching a movie at this time with a weightier message than most every other film of this festive season (even as I appreciate it was initially released in May of 1941!). On the DVD mini-focus on Capra, he's described at one point as a 20th Century Dickens. Taking into account the quality of the peak of his work from "It Happened One Night" in 1934 through to "State Of The Union" in 1948 (with "Meet John Doe" at the epicentre both episodically and fundamentally) I firmly believe he deserves this "timeless" accolade more than any other director I can think of.

    Three Oscars and some successful films under his belt, socially-conscious auteur Frank Capra wanted critical acclaim. So, using a news article that's been in development hell since the 1920s as inspiration, he and scribe pal Bob Riskin composed "Meet John Doe", a tale that's an earnest testament to the common man. A newspaper, the Bulletin, is bought by an oil company. People are sacked, including ambitious reporter Ann Mitchell (spunky, sweet Barbara Stanwyck). Worried about her mom and two kid sisters, Mitchell quickly gets her job back by writing a phony letter, by a "John Doe" who plans to kill himself on Christmas Eve because he's frustrated with the "cold, cruel world", increasing the paper's profits. Derelicts flood the paper's officers, claiming to be the writer, after hearing prospects of getting food and a job. Only one man is picked for the role: John Willoughby (lean, humble Gary Cooper of "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town), an ex-bush league ballplayer, due to a bad arm. With Mitchell as his speech scribe, Willoughby becomes an icon of hope to American's common people and the hoax becomes a crusade, with the motto: "Love thy neighbor". However, the motto's ready to be twisted by ogre-like oil magnate, D.B. Norton (Edward Arnold of "You Can't Take It With You" and "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"), who eyes the White House to be conquered by turning by the John Doe movement into a third party. Will Willoughby have the courage and decency to expose Norton while endangering himself? Like other Capra works, "Doe" has the conflict of the little guy fighting the big guy, but this work's deep and honest with that conflict. Capra, to avoid studio interference, formed a temporary studio to finance the film himself. Who could blame him, for the Norton persona is both obviously allegorical (news magnate William Randolph Hearst, Columbia Pictures's co-head Harry Cohn) and prophetic (Rupert Murdoch), with his tactics, politically ambitious and corporate shark-like. Riskin's script is crackerjack, and the actors give it life. Cooper's shy and earnest, matching Stanwyck's boldness and passion. Supporting players are noteworthy; James Gleason's hardboiled as Stanwyck's editor; Cooper's longtime chum Walter Brennan ("The Real McCoys") is a hole-infested misanthropism sack as Willoughby's pal, the Colonel (his "Heelots" speech is funny, sad and thought-provoking); Irving Bacon ("Deeds") provides goofiness as newspaper gopher Beany and Spring Brighton ("Take It") is warm and wise as Ann's mom. Some people today have hijacked elements of Capra's work, emphasizing on moral values while crucifying those who aren't like them. They, like Norton, have forgotten a sense of humility. With humor and drama, "Doe" has that.

    In a attempt to boost profits, publisher Edward Arnold (as D.B. Norton) changes his metropolitan newspaper from "The Bulletin" to "The New Bulletin", and its motto from "A free press for a free people," to "A streamlined newspaper for a streamlined era." Unfortunately, for leggy columnist Barbara Stanwyck (as Ann Mitchell), "streamlining" means she loses her job. Managing editor James Gleason (as Henry Connell) explains Ms. Stanwyck's columns lack "fireworks"; so, she leaves the paper with an explosive last shot - in her final column, Stanwyck makes up a story about a man threatening to commit suicide due to the sad state of world affairs. The man, called "John Doe", vows to jump from the roof of City Hall on Christmas Eve. Stanwyck's story is a sensational circulation booster, and she gets to keep her job. Good thing, as she is supporting an overspending mother (Spring Byington), two girls, and a dog. To keep the story going, Stanwyck and the "Bulletin" hire hobo Gary Cooper (as Long John Willoughby) to play the part of "John Doe" until December 26th; after which, he will be sent packing. A baseball player with a bum arm, Mr. Cooper has been sleeping "under the bridge" with bumming pal Walter Brennan (as "Colonel"). The two men move in to a swanky hotel room, and Mr. Brennan tries to get Mr. Cooper to return to life as his homeless companion. Struggling with the morality of his impersonation, Cooper shocks everyone by contemplating an actual suicidal jump. There are a lot of "swell" Frank Capra touches in the film - especially keep an eye on Brennan, who makes the most of his "tramp" costume. The film is very well directed, and features an outstanding cast of dependable performers. Stanwyck is "Best Actress"-worthy (many of her lead performances are). By the end of 1941, many of the actors herein were nominated for performances in other films - Stanwyck in "Ball of Fire", Copper in "Sergeant York", Brennan in "The Westerner", and Mr. Gleason in "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" - each could have conceivably been nominated for "Meet John Doe". The office boy signaling the opening layoffs (future "Bowery Boy" Benny Bartlett) also portends a wealth of small roles, walk-ons, and bit players. Watch for silent film star Rod La Rocque to shine for the last time, in his well-suited role as Mr. Arnold's nephew "Ted Sheldon ". Cinematographer George Barnes excels, particularly during the last act. The film ends up uneasily celebrating Christianity as the healer of its open, festering wounds. "Meet John Doe" falls in to a worthwhile second tier of Capra productions; he and writer Robert Riskin ended their string of successful collaborations with this one. ******** Meet John Doe (5/3/41) Frank Capra ~ Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyck, Walter Brennan, James Gleason

    Reporter Ann Mitchell gets fired.As a parting shot she writes a fake letter from a unenomployed "John Doe".This nonexistent John Doe threatens to take his own life on Christman Eve as a protest of social ills.The paper has to rehire Ann Mitchell and hire someone to impersonate John Doe.That someone is John Willoughby, also known as Long John, who used to be a baseball player and is now a tramp.He is in desperate need of money to repair his injured arm so that he can play again.So he becomes John Doe.He becomes a national hero, the hero of the common folks.He steps into a diner and the whole place goes all crazy when they find out John Doe is there.The Doe philosophy spreads across the country.It takes a whole new turn, to the worse, when it develops into a political movement.The newspaper's publisher D.B. Norton plans to use Doe as his way into the White House.Meet John Doe (1941) is a Frank Capra movie.Frank Capra's first choice to play John Doe was Gary Cooper, and he got the part.Hardly anybody could do the job better than him.Cooper took the job without even reading the script.He enjoyed his earlier collaboration with Capra five years earlier, and he also wanted to work with Barbara Stanwyck.Stanwyck is the perfect woman to play the role of Ann Mitchell.Edward Arnold is a perfect man to play the villain, Mr. Norton.You have to like Walter Brennan, who plays the tramp friend of John, The Colonel.Spring Byington is marvelous as Ann's mother.James Gleason is great as Henry Connell.Regis Toomey plays the soda jerk Bert Hansen and Ann Doran is Mrs. Hansen.They have been showing his pictures here for the past few weeks and just yesterday I saw this one. is the But This movie is a mixture of harsh realism and optimism.Frank Capra's movies are there to give hope.They are the perfect cure for the cynicism.
