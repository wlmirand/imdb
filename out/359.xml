    Before watching it, I expected an average action movie without depth, a simple entertainment. Nevertheless, this movie is better than expected. It is really amusing and the characters are well developed. The plot is not original (in fact, I saw other two movies about the terrorist called "The Jackal, which are very good, too). The director Christian Duguay, who also directed another decent action thriller titled "The art of war", knew how to set a fluid and amusing pace which makes you pay attention to the movie during its entire duration (less than two hours, but not short). The cast is rather good. Both the protagonist and the antagonist roles is played by Aidan Quinn (yes, he plays the part of the bad and the bad guys: the soldier assigned to hunt down the Jackal and the Jackal himself because they are supposed to be very alike phisically). Ben Kingsley plays another important role and is very correct. Maybe, the most interesting character is played by Donald Sutherland: he plays the part of the CIA agent who trains and tells the protagonist to kill the Jackal even by blackmailing him. The reasons are never very clear, but we know that he is eager to catch the Jackal. The action scenes are realistic and well-made (specially, the ones of the training and the car chase). The movie has some violent intense scenes, like some showing how the protagonist gets ready to impersonate the Jackal in order to catch him. The rest of the cast does a decent job with no more special mentions. There is nothing relevant about the photography and the sound (it is simply right). In conclusion, the best things of the movie are the intensity of some scenes as well as its pace whereas the worse thing is that it has nothing else remarkable, like a very original plot, amazing action scenes, a beautiful photography, etc. All those who like realistic action movies and thrillers will surely enjoy "The assignment". 8.

    How do you catch Carlos the Jackal? A Naval officer, CIA agent and a Mossad agent all work together to find out. See "Day of the Jackal" and "The Jackal" for alternative artistic impressions of the notorious terrorist, but see "The Assignment" for the best all around movie by far! The film is perhaps most notable for its harsh and honest look at the physical and mental training as well as personal sacrifices a spy must undertake in order to become "superhuman." Look out for the scene near Israel's Dead Sea where the hero undergoes special training... fantastic to see these exercises displayed in a film starring 3 great actors (in 4 roles) who compliment each other without overshadowing each other, maybe one of the best spy films of the 1990s!

    ***SPOILERS*** A bit overcomplicated and confusing spy thriller involving US Navy Lt. Commander Cuban born Annibal Ramirez, Adian Quinn, who's recruited with a little bit of arm twisting by the CIA and Israeli Mossad to play the part of Carlos the Jackel in that Annibal is the spitting image of the notorious assassin. Behind all this cloak and dagger stuff is Paris CIA Director Jack Shaw, Donald Southerland, who has it in Carlos for strictly personal reasons! That's when back in September 1974 Carlos, disguised as a 1960's type of hippie, slipped right through his fingers and ended up blowing up a Paris caf&eacute; with Shaw, who survived the blast, being in it! Shaw with the help of Mossad Agent Amos,Ben Kingley, teach Ramirez all about Carlos' quirks and habits as well as his style, rough to the point of almost killing his partner, of lovemaking and send him out to Libya in a plot to have him make his backers, the Soviet KGB, think that he's about to turn on them and join the other side": The USA and its Western allies! This all has Ramirez end up killing a number of French Secret Agents, who raided his love nest, who mistakenly think that he's Carlos. Carlos himself in thinking he's being set up has one of his henchman Japanese assassin Koj, Von Flores, travel to Paris to knock off his girlfriend Agnieska, Liliana Komorowaka, who mistook Ramirez for himself whom Carlos feels betrayed him to the French Secret Service. Ramirez together with Shaw and Amos who just happened to be in Paris at the time of Agnieska's murder is later confronted by Koj who realizes, by Ramirez not knowing the right code word, that he isn't Carlos who then takes him, with a gun pointed in his gut, to a airport mens-room in order to knock him off! It's then that Amos comes to Ramirez's rescue by not only taking out the surprised Koj but taking a bullet or two for him at the same time! ***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Meamwhile the KGB smells a rat in Carlos in him suspected of working for American intelligence,the CIA, and raid his pad outside East Berlin in order to take him in for questioning. This lead to a free for all shootout at Carlos', who was buff naked at the time, love pad where he's later run down by Ramirez who together with his boss Shaw were outside watching the whole spectacle. With both Carlos & Ramirez slugging it out Shaw not knowing which is which ends up shooting and seriously wounding the wrong man, Ramirez, with Carlos, now with his clothes on, getting away! The film ends in a confusing note with Ramirez now fully recovered from his wounds back in the states reunited with his wife and young son and Carlos now a man not only without a country but wanted by his former employers the KGB who've got a 50 million dollar or ruble contract out on him. We've still got a big surprise coming at the end the movie that's not at all lacking in surprises but by the time it hits us were just too numb or punch-drunk,in all the surprises we've already seen, to both notice or appreciate it!

    Christian Duguay directed 'The Assignment', a supposedly thrilling, suspenseful action movie with great stunts and clever twists and turns. On paper the movie already sounds good but the finished product is a big, confusing borefest with little content. 'The Assignment' tells the adventures of a crimelord named Carlos and a United States Army officer named Lt. Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez. Carlos is a ruthless terrorist who has no remorse towards any person of any race, religion of age. A prime douchebag if you will. After another terrorist attack Donald Sutherland decides that he must be stopped. After a while he encounters Ramirez and hatches the plan that he should be Carlos for a while to infiltrate in his network of gangs and violence. Sutherland is not alone, as he brings Ben Kingsley along for the ride to help him train Ramirez. Half the movie's running time later the duo think Ramirez is properly trained and then set him out to destroy Carlos' empire from within. The movie is haunted by some moments of cheesy acting and the laws of improbability; Ramirez rarely gets a scratch on him as he gets through chase scenes, gunfire and stunts nearly completely unharmed. The movie is also filled with more plot holes than a slice of Swiss cheese. I constantly found them and I'm usually not a person who nitpicks on this kind of subject, as movies are intended to be enjoyed and not deeply analyzed to the letter. The special effects in the movie are great for it's time though, I'll give it that. In a scene where Carlos drops a grenade it really feels as if the fire is coming right into your face. So why did I said the movie was a borefest? Well... you've seen everything in the movie before. While I hate it that I can't give spoilers away, you'll never be surprised in the movie or there isn't a huge shocker in the end of it all, it's really kind of frustrating and unsatisfying that you sat through a (nearly) two-hour movie without a big ending. In all, 'The Assignment' isn't bad... on some levels, but it certainly isn't good either. Everything here is run-of-the-mill and as stock as ever. The actors delivers a fair job but there is no person you're looking forward to see here, not even Donald Sutherland.

    The only photo that exists of Carlos the Jackals is a grainy one taken a half mile away. Lt. Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn) looks like the man in the photo. and Jack Shaw, C.I.A (Donald Sutherland) wants him to set a trap. Ramirez becomes Carlos with the help of Shaw and Mossad agent Amos (Ben Kingsley). He goes about screwing Carlos' women (C&eacute;line Bonnier & Liliana Komorowska), and he doesn't attract Carlos, but a whole lot of people who want to kill him thinking he is Carlos. What a job! This film is one of the better action thrillers as it is not a "star vehicle," but a great group of actors who create a believable story. And, I may add, gives us pause at the end.

    So once again do we have "The Jackal " as the main theme of a movie. Only this time it is the actual terrorist who is the center of attraction. A movie which tries hard to weave the elements of fact and fiction together but fails to do so convincingly. The story revolves around the life of a Naval Officer from the U.S. who as luck would have it, looks strikingly similar to The Jackal. With this the story moves on as various international intelligence agencies indulge in a game of cat and mouse to do their bit. With slightly type-cast acting and characterisation , not to mention the fantastically sketched out plot the movie somehow doesn't dissolve in the tummy. On the whole the movie has many bright spots in terms of the story and technical aspects but fails to come across as a superb thriller due to hastened plot progression and disproportionate reel allocation to relatively less important and insignificant features of the storyline.

    Throughout the world the unmistakable imprint of the American C.I.A. can be found in many a muddled mess they have left behind. In the beginning, their objectives were simple: spy, remove enemy agents, steal classified information and destabilize unfavorable governments. Years have elapse and although their mission remains similar, their clandestine black operations now include domestic spying, discrediting U.S. citizens and infiltrating American organizations who criticize the U.S. government. This movie however, centers on the C.I.A.'s world manhunt for the infamous 'Carlos, the Jackel.' The film is called " The Assignment " and tells the story Lt. Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez, (Aidan Quinn) a U.S. naval officer who bears a striking resemblance to the mastermind of so many terrorist bombings. Recruited by Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) of the C.I.A. and Amos (Ben Kingsley), a special agent from the Israeli Mosad, Ramirez is secretly trained to look, pose, infiltrate the elusive organization and to thereafter discredit the real Jackel working for the Russians. This film is Explosively exciting, and packed with wild chases, killings and inter-country mayhem. Quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic playing both sides of the war. Easily one of his best efforts. ****

    Every single thing about this movie works. Characters, setting, photography, special effects, action... everything. It's a must see for someone looking for a thrill, as well as a must see for someone who just wants to know how a character should be developed. One of the few movies, that actually takes the risk of making the good guys active, not just waiting for the bad guy to do bad stuff. One of the few movies, that takes the risk of showing how flawed his hero is, and yet keep him likable. Don't miss it. It's not your regular action flick. It's the movie that will make you understand how action movie should be. It's a movie that will make you see the constant war on terror, in a new light.

    A rather good action thriller, but I would have preferred if it was a little more realistic. They tried in some places to go for it, but not all the way (probably for commercial reasons). It's a pity really, since this is a well made movie, but one that had the potential to be much more. If they had made it more realistic, and by that I mean with less James Bond-like shoot-outs, less beautiful women, less funny communists, etc... this motion picture could have been excellent. They just had to use more of the truth and they would have made something much better. The screenplay does cunningly use small parts of the truth in constructing the fiction that this film really is, but this is not nearly enough. I do not believe that they should have made a documentary, but a little less 'artistic creativity' would have actually been 'more' in this case. In other, the camera and sound are also not exceptional which further detracts from the viewing pleasure. All in all, an above average movie, but nothing more.

    A naval officer is recruited to impersonate an infamous terrorist for whom he is a dead ringer. The film is well-paced and has plenty of action, but the plot is clich&eacute;d (as are the characters) and somewhat convoluted (including an ambiguous ending) - not to mention far-fetched. It is well acted by Quinn in the dual role of hero and terrorist, Sutherland as a CIA agent, and Kingsley as an Israeli terrorism expert. It is hard to take any of it seriously, particularly the central premise of two unrelated men looking and sounding exactly alike (they even have the same haircut!). It plays like a TV movie, perhaps not surprising, given director Duguay's background.

    A rather good action thriller, but I would have preferred if it was a little more realistic. They tried in some places to go for it, but not all the way (probably for commercial reasons). It's a pity really, since this is a well made movie, but one that had the potential to be much more. If they had made it more realistic, and by that I mean with less James Bond-like shoot-outs, less beautiful women, less funny communists, etc... this motion picture could have been excellent. They just had to use more of the truth and they would have made something much better. The screenplay does cunningly use small parts of the truth in constructing the fiction that this film really is, but this is not nearly enough. I do not believe that they should have made a documentary, but a little less 'artistic creativity' would have actually been 'more' in this case. In other, the camera and sound are also not exceptional which further detracts from the viewing pleasure. All in all, an above average movie, but nothing more.

    A naval officer is recruited to impersonate an infamous terrorist for whom he is a dead ringer. The film is well-paced and has plenty of action, but the plot is clich&eacute;d (as are the characters) and somewhat convoluted (including an ambiguous ending) - not to mention far-fetched. It is well acted by Quinn in the dual role of hero and terrorist, Sutherland as a CIA agent, and Kingsley as an Israeli terrorism expert. It is hard to take any of it seriously, particularly the central premise of two unrelated men looking and sounding exactly alike (they even have the same haircut!). It plays like a TV movie, perhaps not surprising, given director Duguay's background.

    Before watching it, I expected an average action movie without depth, a simple entertainment. Nevertheless, this movie is better than expected. It is really amusing and the characters are well developed. The plot is not original (in fact, I saw other two movies about the terrorist called "The Jackal, which are very good, too). The director Christian Duguay, who also directed another decent action thriller titled "The art of war", knew how to set a fluid and amusing pace which makes you pay attention to the movie during its entire duration (less than two hours, but not short). The cast is rather good. Both the protagonist and the antagonist roles is played by Aidan Quinn (yes, he plays the part of the bad and the bad guys: the soldier assigned to hunt down the Jackal and the Jackal himself because they are supposed to be very alike phisically). Ben Kingsley plays another important role and is very correct. Maybe, the most interesting character is played by Donald Sutherland: he plays the part of the CIA agent who trains and tells the protagonist to kill the Jackal even by blackmailing him. The reasons are never very clear, but we know that he is eager to catch the Jackal. The action scenes are realistic and well-made (specially, the ones of the training and the car chase). The movie has some violent intense scenes, like some showing how the protagonist gets ready to impersonate the Jackal in order to catch him. The rest of the cast does a decent job with no more special mentions. There is nothing relevant about the photography and the sound (it is simply right). In conclusion, the best things of the movie are the intensity of some scenes as well as its pace whereas the worse thing is that it has nothing else remarkable, like a very original plot, amazing action scenes, a beautiful photography, etc. All those who like realistic action movies and thrillers will surely enjoy "The assignment". 8.

    How do you catch Carlos the Jackal? A Naval officer, CIA agent and a Mossad agent all work together to find out. See "Day of the Jackal" and "The Jackal" for alternative artistic impressions of the notorious terrorist, but see "The Assignment" for the best all around movie by far! The film is perhaps most notable for its harsh and honest look at the physical and mental training as well as personal sacrifices a spy must undertake in order to become "superhuman." Look out for the scene near Israel's Dead Sea where the hero undergoes special training... fantastic to see these exercises displayed in a film starring 3 great actors (in 4 roles) who compliment each other without overshadowing each other, maybe one of the best spy films of the 1990s!

    ***SPOILERS*** A bit overcomplicated and confusing spy thriller involving US Navy Lt. Commander Cuban born Annibal Ramirez, Adian Quinn, who's recruited with a little bit of arm twisting by the CIA and Israeli Mossad to play the part of Carlos the Jackel in that Annibal is the spitting image of the notorious assassin. Behind all this cloak and dagger stuff is Paris CIA Director Jack Shaw, Donald Southerland, who has it in Carlos for strictly personal reasons! That's when back in September 1974 Carlos, disguised as a 1960's type of hippie, slipped right through his fingers and ended up blowing up a Paris caf&eacute; with Shaw, who survived the blast, being in it! Shaw with the help of Mossad Agent Amos,Ben Kingley, teach Ramirez all about Carlos' quirks and habits as well as his style, rough to the point of almost killing his partner, of lovemaking and send him out to Libya in a plot to have him make his backers, the Soviet KGB, think that he's about to turn on them and join the other side": The USA and its Western allies! This all has Ramirez end up killing a number of French Secret Agents, who raided his love nest, who mistakenly think that he's Carlos. Carlos himself in thinking he's being set up has one of his henchman Japanese assassin Koj, Von Flores, travel to Paris to knock off his girlfriend Agnieska, Liliana Komorowaka, who mistook Ramirez for himself whom Carlos feels betrayed him to the French Secret Service. Ramirez together with Shaw and Amos who just happened to be in Paris at the time of Agnieska's murder is later confronted by Koj who realizes, by Ramirez not knowing the right code word, that he isn't Carlos who then takes him, with a gun pointed in his gut, to a airport mens-room in order to knock him off! It's then that Amos comes to Ramirez's rescue by not only taking out the surprised Koj but taking a bullet or two for him at the same time! ***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Meamwhile the KGB smells a rat in Carlos in him suspected of working for American intelligence,the CIA, and raid his pad outside East Berlin in order to take him in for questioning. This lead to a free for all shootout at Carlos', who was buff naked at the time, love pad where he's later run down by Ramirez who together with his boss Shaw were outside watching the whole spectacle. With both Carlos & Ramirez slugging it out Shaw not knowing which is which ends up shooting and seriously wounding the wrong man, Ramirez, with Carlos, now with his clothes on, getting away! The film ends in a confusing note with Ramirez now fully recovered from his wounds back in the states reunited with his wife and young son and Carlos now a man not only without a country but wanted by his former employers the KGB who've got a 50 million dollar or ruble contract out on him. We've still got a big surprise coming at the end the movie that's not at all lacking in surprises but by the time it hits us were just too numb or punch-drunk,in all the surprises we've already seen, to both notice or appreciate it!

    Christian Duguay directed 'The Assignment', a supposedly thrilling, suspenseful action movie with great stunts and clever twists and turns. On paper the movie already sounds good but the finished product is a big, confusing borefest with little content. 'The Assignment' tells the adventures of a crimelord named Carlos and a United States Army officer named Lt. Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez. Carlos is a ruthless terrorist who has no remorse towards any person of any race, religion of age. A prime douchebag if you will. After another terrorist attack Donald Sutherland decides that he must be stopped. After a while he encounters Ramirez and hatches the plan that he should be Carlos for a while to infiltrate in his network of gangs and violence. Sutherland is not alone, as he brings Ben Kingsley along for the ride to help him train Ramirez. Half the movie's running time later the duo think Ramirez is properly trained and then set him out to destroy Carlos' empire from within. The movie is haunted by some moments of cheesy acting and the laws of improbability; Ramirez rarely gets a scratch on him as he gets through chase scenes, gunfire and stunts nearly completely unharmed. The movie is also filled with more plot holes than a slice of Swiss cheese. I constantly found them and I'm usually not a person who nitpicks on this kind of subject, as movies are intended to be enjoyed and not deeply analyzed to the letter. The special effects in the movie are great for it's time though, I'll give it that. In a scene where Carlos drops a grenade it really feels as if the fire is coming right into your face. So why did I said the movie was a borefest? Well... you've seen everything in the movie before. While I hate it that I can't give spoilers away, you'll never be surprised in the movie or there isn't a huge shocker in the end of it all, it's really kind of frustrating and unsatisfying that you sat through a (nearly) two-hour movie without a big ending. In all, 'The Assignment' isn't bad... on some levels, but it certainly isn't good either. Everything here is run-of-the-mill and as stock as ever. The actors delivers a fair job but there is no person you're looking forward to see here, not even Donald Sutherland.

    The only photo that exists of Carlos the Jackals is a grainy one taken a half mile away. Lt. Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn) looks like the man in the photo. and Jack Shaw, C.I.A (Donald Sutherland) wants him to set a trap. Ramirez becomes Carlos with the help of Shaw and Mossad agent Amos (Ben Kingsley). He goes about screwing Carlos' women (C&eacute;line Bonnier & Liliana Komorowska), and he doesn't attract Carlos, but a whole lot of people who want to kill him thinking he is Carlos. What a job! This film is one of the better action thrillers as it is not a "star vehicle," but a great group of actors who create a believable story. And, I may add, gives us pause at the end.

    So once again do we have "The Jackal " as the main theme of a movie. Only this time it is the actual terrorist who is the center of attraction. A movie which tries hard to weave the elements of fact and fiction together but fails to do so convincingly. The story revolves around the life of a Naval Officer from the U.S. who as luck would have it, looks strikingly similar to The Jackal. With this the story moves on as various international intelligence agencies indulge in a game of cat and mouse to do their bit. With slightly type-cast acting and characterisation , not to mention the fantastically sketched out plot the movie somehow doesn't dissolve in the tummy. On the whole the movie has many bright spots in terms of the story and technical aspects but fails to come across as a superb thriller due to hastened plot progression and disproportionate reel allocation to relatively less important and insignificant features of the storyline.

    Throughout the world the unmistakable imprint of the American C.I.A. can be found in many a muddled mess they have left behind. In the beginning, their objectives were simple: spy, remove enemy agents, steal classified information and destabilize unfavorable governments. Years have elapse and although their mission remains similar, their clandestine black operations now include domestic spying, discrediting U.S. citizens and infiltrating American organizations who criticize the U.S. government. This movie however, centers on the C.I.A.'s world manhunt for the infamous 'Carlos, the Jackel.' The film is called " The Assignment " and tells the story Lt. Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez, (Aidan Quinn) a U.S. naval officer who bears a striking resemblance to the mastermind of so many terrorist bombings. Recruited by Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) of the C.I.A. and Amos (Ben Kingsley), a special agent from the Israeli Mosad, Ramirez is secretly trained to look, pose, infiltrate the elusive organization and to thereafter discredit the real Jackel working for the Russians. This film is Explosively exciting, and packed with wild chases, killings and inter-country mayhem. Quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic playing both sides of the war. Easily one of his best efforts. ****

    Every single thing about this movie works. Characters, setting, photography, special effects, action... everything. It's a must see for someone looking for a thrill, as well as a must see for someone who just wants to know how a character should be developed. One of the few movies, that actually takes the risk of making the good guys active, not just waiting for the bad guy to do bad stuff. One of the few movies, that takes the risk of showing how flawed his hero is, and yet keep him likable. Don't miss it. It's not your regular action flick. It's the movie that will make you understand how action movie should be. It's a movie that will make you see the constant war on terror, in a new light.

It's a must see for someone looking for a thrill, as well as a must see for someone who just wants to know how a character should be developed. One of the few movies, that actually takes the risk of making the good guys active, not just waiting for the bad guy to do bad stuff. One of the few movies, that takes the risk of showing how flawed his hero is, and yet keep him likable. Don't miss it. It's not your regular action flick. It's the movie that will make you understand how action movie should be. It's a movie that will make you see the constant war on terror, in a new light.

    A rather good action thriller, but I would have preferred if it was a little more realistic. They tried in some places to go for it, but not all the way (probably for commercial reasons). It's a pity really, since this is a well made movie, but one that had the potential to be much more. If they had made it more realistic, and by that I mean with less James Bond-like shoot-outs, less beautiful women, less funny communists, etc... this motion picture could have been excellent. They just had to use more of the truth and they would have made something much better. The screenplay does cunningly use small parts of the truth in constructing the fiction that this film really is, but this is not nearly enough. I do not believe that they should have made a documentary, but a little less 'artistic creativity' would have actually been 'more' in this case. In other, the camera and sound are also not exceptional which further detracts from the viewing pleasure. All in all, an above average movie, but nothing more.

    A naval officer is recruited to impersonate an infamous terrorist for whom he is a dead ringer. The film is well-paced and has plenty of action, but the plot is clich&eacute;d (as are the characters) and somewhat convoluted (including an ambiguous ending) - not to mention far-fetched. It is well acted by Quinn in the dual role of hero and terrorist, Sutherland as a CIA agent, and Kingsley as an Israeli terrorism expert. It is hard to take any of it seriously, particularly the central premise of two unrelated men looking and sounding exactly alike (they even have the same haircut!). It plays like a TV movie, perhaps not surprising, given director Duguay's background.

    Before watching it, I expected an average action movie without depth, a simple entertainment. Nevertheless, this movie is better than expected. It is really amusing and the characters are well developed. The plot is not original (in fact, I saw other two movies about the terrorist called "The Jackal, which are very good, too). The director Christian Duguay, who also directed another decent action thriller titled "The art of war", knew how to set a fluid and amusing pace which makes you pay attention to the movie during its entire duration (less than two hours, but not short). The cast is rather good. Both the protagonist and the antagonist roles is played by Aidan Quinn (yes, he plays the part of the bad and the bad guys: the soldier assigned to hunt down the Jackal and the Jackal himself because they are supposed to be very alike phisically). Ben Kingsley plays another important role and is very correct. Maybe, the most interesting character is played by Donald Sutherland: he plays the part of the CIA agent who trains and tells the protagonist to kill the Jackal even by blackmailing him. The reasons are never very clear, but we know that he is eager to catch the Jackal. The action scenes are realistic and well-made (specially, the ones of the training and the car chase). The movie has some violent intense scenes, like some showing how the protagonist gets ready to impersonate the Jackal in order to catch him. The rest of the cast does a decent job with no more special mentions. There is nothing relevant about the photography and the sound (it is simply right). In conclusion, the best things of the movie are the intensity of some scenes as well as its pace whereas the worse thing is that it has nothing else remarkable, like a very original plot, amazing action scenes, a beautiful photography, etc. All those who like realistic action movies and thrillers will surely enjoy "The assignment". 8.

    How do you catch Carlos the Jackal? A Naval officer, CIA agent and a Mossad agent all work together to find out. See "Day of the Jackal" and "The Jackal" for alternative artistic impressions of the notorious terrorist, but see "The Assignment" for the best all around movie by far! The film is perhaps most notable for its harsh and honest look at the physical and mental training as well as personal sacrifices a spy must undertake in order to become "superhuman." Look out for the scene near Israel's Dead Sea where the hero undergoes special training... fantastic to see these exercises displayed in a film starring 3 great actors (in 4 roles) who compliment each other without overshadowing each other, maybe one of the best spy films of the 1990s!

    ***SPOILERS*** A bit overcomplicated and confusing spy thriller involving US Navy Lt. Commander Cuban born Annibal Ramirez, Adian Quinn, who's recruited with a little bit of arm twisting by the CIA and Israeli Mossad to play the part of Carlos the Jackel in that Annibal is the spitting image of the notorious assassin. Behind all this cloak and dagger stuff is Paris CIA Director Jack Shaw, Donald Southerland, who has it in Carlos for strictly personal reasons! That's when back in September 1974 Carlos, disguised as a 1960's type of hippie, slipped right through his fingers and ended up blowing up a Paris caf&eacute; with Shaw, who survived the blast, being in it! Shaw with the help of Mossad Agent Amos,Ben Kingley, teach Ramirez all about Carlos' quirks and habits as well as his style, rough to the point of almost killing his partner, of lovemaking and send him out to Libya in a plot to have him make his backers, the Soviet KGB, think that he's about to turn on them and join the other side": The USA and its Western allies! This all has Ramirez end up killing a number of French Secret Agents, who raided his love nest, who mistakenly think that he's Carlos. Carlos himself in thinking he's being set up has one of his henchman Japanese assassin Koj, Von Flores, travel to Paris to knock off his girlfriend Agnieska, Liliana Komorowaka, who mistook Ramirez for himself whom Carlos feels betrayed him to the French Secret Service. Ramirez together with Shaw and Amos who just happened to be in Paris at the time of Agnieska's murder is later confronted by Koj who realizes, by Ramirez not knowing the right code word, that he isn't Carlos who then takes him, with a gun pointed in his gut, to a airport mens-room in order to knock him off! It's then that Amos comes to Ramirez's rescue by not only taking out the surprised Koj but taking a bullet or two for him at the same time! ***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Meamwhile the KGB smells a rat in Carlos in him suspected of working for American intelligence,the CIA, and raid his pad outside East Berlin in order to take him in for questioning. This lead to a free for all shootout at Carlos', who was buff naked at the time, love pad where he's later run down by Ramirez who together with his boss Shaw were outside watching the whole spectacle. With both Carlos & Ramirez slugging it out Shaw not knowing which is which ends up shooting and seriously wounding the wrong man, Ramirez, with Carlos, now with his clothes on, getting away! The film ends in a confusing note with Ramirez now fully recovered from his wounds back in the states reunited with his wife and young son and Carlos now a man not only without a country but wanted by his former employers the KGB who've got a 50 million dollar or ruble contract out on him. We've still got a big surprise coming at the end the movie that's not at all lacking in surprises but by the time it hits us were just too numb or punch-drunk,in all the surprises we've already seen, to both notice or appreciate it!

    Christian Duguay directed 'The Assignment', a supposedly thrilling, suspenseful action movie with great stunts and clever twists and turns. On paper the movie already sounds good but the finished product is a big, confusing borefest with little content. 'The Assignment' tells the adventures of a crimelord named Carlos and a United States Army officer named Lt. Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez. Carlos is a ruthless terrorist who has no remorse towards any person of any race, religion of age. A prime douchebag if you will. After another terrorist attack Donald Sutherland decides that he must be stopped. After a while he encounters Ramirez and hatches the plan that he should be Carlos for a while to infiltrate in his network of gangs and violence. Sutherland is not alone, as he brings Ben Kingsley along for the ride to help him train Ramirez. Half the movie's running time later the duo think Ramirez is properly trained and then set him out to destroy Carlos' empire from within. The movie is haunted by some moments of cheesy acting and the laws of improbability; Ramirez rarely gets a scratch on him as he gets through chase scenes, gunfire and stunts nearly completely unharmed. The movie is also filled with more plot holes than a slice of Swiss cheese. I constantly found them and I'm usually not a person who nitpicks on this kind of subject, as movies are intended to be enjoyed and not deeply analyzed to the letter. The special effects in the movie are great for it's time though, I'll give it that. In a scene where Carlos drops a grenade it really feels as if the fire is coming right into your face. So why did I said the movie was a borefest? Well... you've seen everything in the movie before. While I hate it that I can't give spoilers away, you'll never be surprised in the movie or there isn't a huge shocker in the end of it all, it's really kind of frustrating and unsatisfying that you sat through a (nearly) two-hour movie without a big ending. In all, 'The Assignment' isn't bad... on some levels, but it certainly isn't good either. Everything here is run-of-the-mill and as stock as ever. The actors delivers a fair job but there is no person you're looking forward to see here, not even Donald Sutherland.

    The only photo that exists of Carlos the Jackals is a grainy one taken a half mile away. Lt. Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn) looks like the man in the photo. and Jack Shaw, C.I.A (Donald Sutherland) wants him to set a trap. Ramirez becomes Carlos with the help of Shaw and Mossad agent Amos (Ben Kingsley). He goes about screwing Carlos' women (C&eacute;line Bonnier & Liliana Komorowska), and he doesn't attract Carlos, but a whole lot of people who want to kill him thinking he is Carlos. What a job! This film is one of the better action thrillers as it is not a "star vehicle," but a great group of actors who create a believable story. And, I may add, gives us pause at the end.

    So once again do we have "The Jackal " as the main theme of a movie. Only this time it is the actual terrorist who is the center of attraction. A movie which tries hard to weave the elements of fact and fiction together but fails to do so convincingly. The story revolves around the life of a Naval Officer from the U.S. who as luck would have it, looks strikingly similar to The Jackal. With this the story moves on as various international intelligence agencies indulge in a game of cat and mouse to do their bit. With slightly type-cast acting and characterisation , not to mention the fantastically sketched out plot the movie somehow doesn't dissolve in the tummy. On the whole the movie has many bright spots in terms of the story and technical aspects but fails to come across as a superb thriller due to hastened plot progression and disproportionate reel allocation to relatively less important and insignificant features of the storyline.

    Throughout the world the unmistakable imprint of the American C.I.A. can be found in many a muddled mess they have left behind. In the beginning, their objectives were simple: spy, remove enemy agents, steal classified information and destabilize unfavorable governments. Years have elapse and although their mission remains similar, their clandestine black operations now include domestic spying, discrediting U.S. citizens and infiltrating American organizations who criticize the U.S. government. This movie however, centers on the C.I.A.'s world manhunt for the infamous 'Carlos, the Jackel.' The film is called " The Assignment " and tells the story Lt. Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez, (Aidan Quinn) a U.S. naval officer who bears a striking resemblance to the mastermind of so many terrorist bombings. Recruited by Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) of the C.I.A. and Amos (Ben Kingsley), a special agent from the Israeli Mosad, Ramirez is secretly trained to look, pose, infiltrate the elusive organization and to thereafter discredit the real Jackel working for the Russians. This film is Explosively exciting, and packed with wild chases, killings and inter-country mayhem. Quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic playing both sides of the war. Easily one of his best efforts. ****

    Every single thing about this movie works. Characters, setting, photography, special effects, action... everything. It's a must see for someone looking for a thrill, as well as a must see for someone who just wants to know how a character should be developed. One of the few movies, that actually takes the risk of making the good guys active, not just waiting for the bad guy to do bad stuff. One of the few movies, that takes the risk of showing how flawed his hero is, and yet keep him likable. Don't miss it. It's not your regular action flick. It's the movie that will make you understand how action movie should be. It's a movie that will make you see the constant war on terror, in a new light.

    A rather good action thriller, but I would have preferred if it was a little more realistic. They tried in some places to go for it, but not all the way (probably for commercial reasons). It's a pity really, since this is a well made movie, but one that had the potential to be much more. If they had made it more realistic, and by that I mean with less James Bond-like shoot-outs, less beautiful women, less funny communists, etc... this motion picture could have been excellent. They just had to use more of the truth and they would have made something much better. The screenplay does cunningly use small parts of the truth in constructing the fiction that this film really is, but this is not nearly enough. I do not believe that they should have made a documentary, but a little less 'artistic creativity' would have actually been 'more' in this case. In other, the camera and sound are also not exceptional which further detracts from the viewing pleasure. All in all, an above average movie, but nothing more.

    A naval officer is recruited to impersonate an infamous terrorist for whom he is a dead ringer. The film is well-paced and has plenty of action, but the plot is clich&eacute;d (as are the characters) and somewhat convoluted (including an ambiguous ending) - not to mention far-fetched. It is well acted by Quinn in the dual role of hero and terrorist, Sutherland as a CIA agent, and Kingsley as an Israeli terrorism expert. It is hard to take any of it seriously, particularly the central premise of two unrelated men looking and sounding exactly alike (they even have the same haircut!). It plays like a TV movie, perhaps not surprising, given director Duguay's background.
