 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Film adaptation of street tough Jim Carroll's epistle about his kaleidoscopic free fall into the harrowing world of drug addiction. As a member of a seemingly unbeatable high school basketball squad, Jim's life centers around the basketball court and the court becomes a metaphor for the world in his mind. A best friend who is dying of leukemia, a coach ("Swifty") who takes unacceptable liberties with the boys on his team, teenage sexual angst, and an unhealthy appetite for heroin -- all of these begin to encroach on young Jim's dream of becoming a basketball star. Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He can't go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim "picked up a game" now and then, is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity.

    The Basketball Diaries is the movie that showed exactly how much acting potential Leonardo DiCaprio has. The good. Gripping sad story. Extreme realism and superb acting, you really get into their shoes, very immersive. You get to understand their story, their situation. Tight well executed scenes. Nice camera work. Solid score. The actors. Not only does Leonardo DiCaprio shine like a true star, but Mark Wahlberg also shows his talent. The rest of the cast is almost as impeccable. The bad. The end scene on the stage is badly staged. No pun intended. It's a bit awkward, but it's easily forgivable. The ugly. It pictures drugs as a social disease whereas their use is actually a symptom of an underlying problem. But then, everybody thinks that, because that's the official story. The result. It's a forbidding tale, but everyone should watch it and understand.

    This film isn't for everyone, you either hate it or love it. It sometimes lacks that constant up-beat easy to watch feel that certain types of audiences need to enjoy a film and is replaced with brutal honesty.The performances from all of the actors were outstanding, with Leonardo DiCaprio performing some of the best acting I have ever seen. His portrayal of Jim was so real and raw that he gave so much of himself to the role that it began to look effortless. So many scenes in this movie were beautifully done. A few stand out moments to name: The basketball scene in the rain, every confrontation between Jim and his mother, and the Withdrawal scene where once again Leo gives a spine tingling performance. If you want to enjoy The Basketball diaries you must go into it with an open mind and take the film for what it is. It isn't a fancy, modern, stylized, glamorized film about drugs but rather an honest, raw, bold and touching movie about the self-destruction of a boy who falls head first into the harrowing world of drug addiction. This movie for me is an overlooked, underrated piece of art. Which is why I love it. I wouldn't change one thing about it.

    Very loosely based on the memoir of the same name, The Basketball Diaries transposes the late '60s adolescence of writer and artist Jim Carroll to some unspecified time period at least 15 years later, further confusing the time frame with three decades of rock music, some by Carroll himself.The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Lorraine Bracco, James Madio, and Mark Wahlberg.It was directed by Scott Kalvert. Jim and his Catholic school chums are on the hottest basketball team in New York, but their friend Bobby languishes in the hospital with leukemia. In-between typically boyish adventures, Jim scribbles in his notebook and experiments with sex and drugs. His group of friends begins to disintegrate after coach Swifty not only makes a pass at Jim, but also catches him and his pals using drugs on the court and kicks them off the team. Out of school and on the streets, Jim turns tricks, betrays friends, robs stores, and deals drugs to feed his heroin addiction. Not even the efforts of former addict Reggie can cure Jim.Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He cannot go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim "picked up a game" now and then, is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity, which ultimately ends with Jim's incarceration in a state penitentiary. After months in the hospital, he gets out and later does a talk show about his drug life, but before that he turned down free drugs given to him by his old friend, Pedro.Jim started out as a practice basketball player, and moved on to writing his memoirs. Although it masquerades as a cautionary tale about the horrors of heroin, this epic of teen-age angst is more accurately seen as a reverential wallow in the gutter of self-absorption.One thing about the plot is that the view never understand what really motivated this intelligent adolescent, a gifted basketball player and sensitive writer, to descend into the hellish life of a drug addict and hustler on the mean streets of New York.It only showed how drugs can destroy one's life.As for the movie,it was a must-see as you get a glimpse of the great actor Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be.

    There was a huge uproar regarding this movie because of a scene where the main character walks into his classroom and starts gunning everybody down with a shotgun. As is typical everybody has missed the whole point of the movie. It is not designed to encourage school shootings, but to show people what heroin is really like. When it comes to violence on television and video games then I will repeat what was said to me once, not that anybody will listen - people are so stubborn that once that have a mindset, no amount of reason will change their mind. Anyway, before television there was an awful lot of violence - the Napoleonic Wars, the thirty years war, the crusades, and even World War I: probably one of the most violent of wars. Even then before literature or even the written language, Cain killed Abel, and he did not do it because a video game made him think that it was a good idea. Violence is apart of our nature and we do it because we are frustrated with the world and the way people react to us. It is basic to our nature, and I am not saying that it is alright, but rather stopping violence in the media is not going to change anything. The Basketball Diaries is about a heroin addict. We follow his life from when he becomes one to when he finally gives up. Even though he does not start off as a heroin addict, he is still taking drugs, or rather sniffing glue. He, Jim Carol, hangs with three other friends and they simply act like teenagers with a lot of energy. Jim is also a champion basketball player. There is a darker side to his life and that is that his best friend is dying of Leukemia. He does not want to believe it, but it is reality and once he dies things slowly begin to change. We are not sure what really happens, but I guess it has something to do with the realisation that they are no longer immortal. But that is not the main reason, it more has to do with the pain and the loss that he suffers after his friend dies, and it is not something that they could have fought against - in fact he was powerless to do anything about it. The realisation of ones weakness is a true humbliser. Starting the addiction is not focused that heavily on in the movie, but his first trip is, and it shows him running through a field of flowers. It is more that he describes how all of his pain has gone away - both the emotional and the physical. This is the thing about Heroin - it is one of the world's best painkillers, but it is also an incredibly addictive drug. What we see is how his life collapses around him as he becomes addicted to Heroin. He is kicked out of school, slowly looses his friends as they are each arrested for various crimes, and finally he himself is taken away as he lies in a pathetic heap before the door to his mothers' apartment. Near the end we even see him resort of Homosexuality, something that horrifies him, especially when he is molested by the basketball coach, to get money for drugs. This is further undermined when the drugs he purchases are fake. The Basketball Diaries is an incredible movie and shows something that we wish to ignore. The school shooting scene is not all that bad, and more shows his frustration with life and the way the drugs take away this frustration - but at a cost. It is something that has been taken right out of proportion and as such people take the wrong idea about the film.

    Jim Carroll's The Basketball Diaries tells in tattered detail how the author went in a few short months from being a Catholic high school basketball star to being a strung-out heroin addict who turned tricks for drugs. Like many such stories, it hangs fondly over the shock and repulsion, and ends with unbecoming quickness after contentment is recovered. Will there ever be a venue for a film about a character who skips through his drug period because he's so excited to show us what he did after he pulled his socks up? Not likely. If there's anything more tiresome than a scandalous parable with a lesson at the end, it's the lesson minus the parable. And so this reverential flounder in the sewer of narcissism shows us profusely that if you become addicted to drugs, you're prone to discover yourself living distraughtly on the streets, selling a body that looks increasingly less like a worthwhile purchase. Carroll was a kid who notwithstanding his misery attempted to develop his experience into prose. The snag with Scott Kalvert's film is that he's apt to translate the experiences too literally: Jim is so urgently pale and miserable that the idealism feels vain. He plays basketball at night in the rain after his best friend dies of leukemia, and it just looks wholly contrived, fake and banal, not poignant. As the film begins, Jim is on the basketball team at a Catholic high school in New York, where a depraved priest drools while spanking disobedient students with a full-size paddle and the class cringes rhythmically. This scene's more indebted to Victorian pornography than to any real private school in 20th century America. Jim and his friends are not upright Catholic boys. They steal from the lockers of the opposing basketball team, and the preferred off-court activity is experimenting with inhalants and pills. Swifty, the coach played by Bruno Kirby, makes implausible passes at Jim. And Jim's mother, played by a sadly wasted Lorraine Bracco, is a crudely flat character who functions here exclusively to implement tough love by kicking him out. Life for Jim is a descending coil of pills, cough medicine, booze, diving off cliffs into the Harlem River, fainting during a game and masturbating on the roof. There are also stirring gleans into the underbelly of users, pushers, hookers and pimps, as Jim floats at large from his comfort zones, while recording all in his diary. Jim's writing predictably operates as a narration. Like most poetry written by teenagers, it's childish idealism, agonizingly earnest, seeing life as sad because the writer's not happy. Soon though, he samples heroin, and "any ache, pain, sadness or guilt was completely flushed out." Remarkable, how real life unravels exactly like the movies. The movie hinges on three hard-wearing formulas: Jim facilitates his dying friend's temporary escape from the hospital so he can push his wheelchair down 42nd Street, Jim sees his ex-teammate on TV playing in an all-star game while Jim is in a squalid bar and, of course, Jim is rescued by a dignified black man, who finds him out cold, brings him home and puts him through cold turkey. In accounts like this, you can continuously rely on a laudable black ex-hoodlum, combing the streets for distressed white kids, functioning for white tolerance soap-boxing purposes as hidden supplies of authenticity and honor. DiCaprio does what he can with the role. Ernie Hudson is solid as the ex-junkie, and there is genuine feeling in Bracco's underwritten mother. But it's Juliette Lewis, as a greasy hooker, who once again taps an utterly real edge. But the movie is not credible. By the end, Jim is seen going in through a stage door, and then we hear him telling the story of his decline and recuperation. We can't determine if this is intended to be actual acknowledgment or a show: That's the whole movie's trouble. While the film has a preachy earnestness more like older films that take drug issues in hand, its mercilessly murky concentration on the despair of drug abuse makes for effective, gripping viewing, if only for purely morbid interest. The teen years, an age of revolt and insecurity in the best of conditions, can be shocking when an individual gets that carried away. This stark, muddled film depicts this, with reductive prurience indeed, but also with brutalizing efficacy.

    Basketball Diaries, The (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Powerful adaptation of Jim Carroll's autobiographical account of his free fall from good student to heroin addict isn't a pretty film to watch but there's no denying its power. Leonard DiCaprio, in his first starring role, plays Carroll who when we first meet him is playing sports and is still in school but soon his minor drug habits start to spin out of control and he finds himself hooked, living on the streets and any hope for the future is nearly gone. I remember going to see THE BASKETBALL DIARIES a week after my fifteenth birthday and still remember what effect it had on me. I really didn't understand all the negative reviews the movie got at the time of its release but I found the film to be remarkably powerful and the message against drug abuse is still very strong in today's time. What all people then agreed on is that star DiCaprio seemed like he could do anything in the world. Coming after supporting roles in films like THIS BOYS LIFE and WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, this was certainly a departure from those two films but it was a real eye-opener because there's some of the most raw and powerful acting that you're ever going to see. The final thirty-minutes of the film pretty much has DiCaprio playing a drugged out character who is just inches away from death and the brutality of the performance is something one isn't going to forget. This is hands down a performance that once you see it it's unlikely to leave your mind and DiCaprio really gives it his all and it's really hard to think of another actor out there who could have given so much to the part. The way DiCaprio just crumbles under the drug abuse is so chilling and haunting that you really do feel as if you're watching a real addict and not just an actor playing a part. The support cast are also quite good with Ernie Hudson coming off extremely strong as a man trying to save the kid and Lorraine Bracco as his mother. Mark Wahlberg, Bruno Kirby and Juliette Lewis are also strong in their roles. I think there are a few issues with the film including too much attempted style by the director and this is really apparent during a sequence where DiCaprio is suffering from withdrawals. The acting is strong enough so the stylistic touches by the director are more distracting than anything else. The screenplay has taken some heat from people but I thought it was pretty good and captured the free-spirit of the novel, which it's based on. THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is as relevant today as it was when first released and it's certainly a terrific showcase for its star who has gone on to prove all those early critics right when they called him one of the greatest actors coming up. The film is a haunting reminder of the downsides of drugs and the rawness of the performances make it hard to watch at times but there's no denying its power.

    I watched this film recently with my girlfriend and several friends having not seen it since around the time when it first came out. I remember at the time thinking how powerful a performance Leonardo Dicaprio gave of Jim Carrol's real life character. The performance was so good I remember at the time telling friends who had recently seen Titanic, that they will be shocked by this performance as it proved he is one of the most versatile actors in cinema today and then. Over the years I have told people I have met, you need to see this movie but not many have and it seems to have sneaked under the radar a little. Therefore when It was on television recently I made everyone watch this film. Everyone who did came back to me saying the same thing, 'wasn't leo good in it'!! The scenes involving Carrol begging his mother to let him into the apartment so he can ask for money to help feed his drug habit are shockingly powerful. Its an amazing portrayal of the dangers of drug addiction and how it can effect young people who dabble with the dangers so quickly, turning their lives on its head with out them realising how it even happened. some strong messages in this film that many teenagers need to watch. Having watched it again some years later, It has dated slightly in time but not only Leo is outstanding but Mark Whalberg shows that he too was showing potential back then 15 years ago or so. I have never been too sure of Whalberg in the past sometimes mixing natural acting ability in movies such as 'the fighter' or his interesting performance of the character police detective 'dignam' in the departed with shocking performances such as 'the happening or Planet of the Apes (where to be honest I don't blame him but the directors for poor casting). But Wharlberg in this movie shows genuine class, perhaps portraying a young man who had an adolecence pretty similar to his diaries character 'mickey'. on a whole the film is a class act and hidden gem. A must see.

    I thought "The Basketball Diaries" was a really good book, but this particular screen translation was bungled. Though a diary, the book is surprisingly well-written considering the author wrote it in his early teens, and it provides a great deal of insight into the world of Irish-Catholic youth in New York City during the 1960's. It's all real, but it reads like a good novel (I honestly liked it a lot more than "The Catcher in the Rye," and even "Junkie" by William S. Burroughs). It is also incredibly graphic, particularly in how it deals with Carroll prostituting himself to support his heroin addiction. I can't think of a single novel written by an adult about teenage life that has balls like that. The problem with the movie is that it totally misses the point of the book. Since Carroll is writing about himself, the book is completely non-judgemental. It simply documents the events. The movie, on the other hand, is like the after-school special version of the book. DiCaprio's character tries heroin, and in the very next scene, he's a filthy bum living in an alleyway. No insight is provided into heroin addiction at all; it's simply more Reagan-era "Just say no" religious crap. The ending in the book is also much bleaker than the ending in the film, which actually ends about 2/3rds of the way through the book, if I remember correctly. I do think the actors in the film were all terrific, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives a surprisingly mature performance. Ernie Hudson was also great, and the photography was gorgeous. But the movie itself just sucks. Read the book instead.

    Ever since hearing the commentary track of Paul Thomas Anderson for the Boogie Nights DVD (I heard it like in early 2008), this title, Scott Kalvert's The Basketball Diaries, came to stay in my mind. I really love the way P.T. Anderson, like Tarantino or now Edgar Wright, talks about his influences, about film in general, and in this case after hearing that he cast Mark Walhberg after seeing his performance in The Basketball Diaries ("god, he was good, god, I though he was so good" Â– and Mark made sure P.T. Anderson wanted him for his acting and not for his body!) definitely made me want to check it out (I Am Cuba is another of the titles that stayed with me thanks to that commentary. I still have to watch it tough). And P.T. Anderson explains that actually his first choice for that part was Leonardo DiCaprio. He doesn't specify, but it's very probable that DiCaprio became his choice also due to The Basketball Diaries (however he decided to do Titanic instead). Anyway, there is not a R4 DVD around that I know, so it was until some weeks ago, when I found on ebay a really cheap R1 DVD of it, when I sort of recall everything and finally got it. When you see a movie with the title of "The Basketball Diaries" and a very young DiCaprio, I mean, a young blonde kid in school clothes in its DVD cover you may not think of it as something really interesting. Definitely you don't think of it as a strong movie about the consequences of drug addiction. This is a movie that deals with the downfall of some very talented young basketball players. It has few to offer for those seeking for a straight sports movie though. We learn that our characters really can play basketball, and pretty much that's it. This is really a straight drug movie. And it's a really good one even though it doesn't really add something "brand-new" to the drug movie sort of formula (but we probably have here the basketball game with the most doped players. That scene features the Doors' "Riders on the Storm", which is pretty cool indeed). My sort of analogy goes with the thing that DiCaprio became like a different actor once he began working with Martin Scorsese back in 2002. He definitely left Titanic behind. Maybe before Scorsese but hell, since Gangs of New York I, at least, see a different DiCaprio. So here in The Basketball Diaries we have like the two DiCaprio. The movie at first sight is a coming of age one with the Titanic DiCaprio suffering the type of education that his Catholic school gives but also having fun with his friends (all are part of a great Catholic basketball team that is pretty much invincible) and stuff; it's a "kids being kids" kind of story. Once the movie gets much darker we get to see the Scorsese DiCaprio. Somehow some scenes really make see the very intense DiCaprio from the Scorsese films. It was a surprise to have him here doing something like that, two years before Titanic (I have yet to see What's Eating Gilbert Grape, for which he earned his first Oscar nomination back in 1994). This is worth watching stuff.

    Based on the autobiographical novel written by Jim Carroll, The Basketball Diaries follows one young man's descent into addiction, crime and homelessness. Jim (here played with mature dedication by Leonardo Di Caprio) is a promising high school basketball player, who along with his three friends, enjoy shooting hoops and getting into general mischief. What starts out as a past-time, soon deteriorates into something more deprived and desperate, as Jim sees his world crash around him as his drug habit becomes an unstoppable affliction. When Jim's situation gets so desperate that he leaves home to hustle and rob on the streets, he begins to push away the people in his life that were once close to him. His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, throws him out after the extremities of his situation become apparent to her and refuses him back. Reggie (Ernie Hudson) was an inspirational figure and mentor to Jim and regularly met up to play basketball in the court. And Neutron (Patrick McGaw) distances himself from Jim and his friends' habits and focuses on his basketball career, much to Jim's dismay. These people will all have a profound effect on Jim's eventual redemption. The film also switches the book's real-life setting from 1960's New York to the 90's. What The Basketball Diaries attempts to do is to create a realistic and gritty (a phrase that seems to be thrown around a lot these days) depiction of drug abuse, and create a hellish portrait of a confused young man who his throwing away his many talents in favour of a life that is doing nothing but ruining his life and isolating the people around him. In reality, this is a terribly-directed film that seems to sledgehammer the phrase 'drugs are bad' into the viewers skull, rather than having the nerve, or in deed the respect, to let the audience make their own mind up. Or maybe the director doesn't have the skill to create a film capable of conjuring up those feelings in the viewer. It sounds ridiculous, but if you have seen the South Park episode where Mr Mackey is giving his anti-drug lecture by simply listing the drugs that are 'bad', then you can see a clear parallel to this film. Jim basically goes from one drug to the other and one crime to the next. It's not interesting, convincing, and to be honest I found it all just very annoying. Jim is a character of no redeeming qualities. He's selfish, careless, and is basically a whiny little kid. Fair enough, this is a chance to develop an interesting, fully-rounded character, but director Scott Kalvert and scriptwriter Bryan Goluboff cannot combine their 'skills' to pull it off. Even though Jim narrates the film and reveals everything about his feelings and opinions, and Di Caprio's fantastic performance, we never get inside Jim's head enough to understand him and why he is willing to give up on a fledging basketball career. This is a character that we're supposed to be praying for to overcome his addiction, but (spoilers!) when his clean-break arrived, I asked myself should I be feeling happy for this arsehole? A well-acted film all-round, namely from the lead and Mark Wahlberg as his friend Mickey, but a film that is swamped in faults and scenes that are just ridiculous. Possibly only remotely remembered for the controversial scene where Jim storms his school with a shotgun in a drug-addled fantasy, which was caught up in the media storm surrounding the Columbine High School massacre. Watch only for signs of early promise from Di Caprio, but otherwise avoid. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Very loosely based on the memoir of the same name, The Basketball Diaries transposes the late '60s adolescence of writer and artist Jim Carroll to some unspecified time period at least 15 years later, further confusing the time frame with three decades of rock music, some by Carroll himself.The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Lorraine Bracco, James Madio, and Mark Wahlberg.It was directed by Scott Kalvert. Jim and his Catholic school chums are on the hottest basketball team in New York, but their friend Bobby languishes in the hospital with leukemia. In-between typically boyish adventures, Jim scribbles in his notebook and experiments with sex and drugs. His group of friends begins to disintegrate after coach Swifty not only makes a pass at Jim, but also catches him and his pals using drugs on the court and kicks them off the team. Out of school and on the streets, Jim turns tricks, betrays friends, robs stores, and deals drugs to feed his heroin addiction. Not even the efforts of former addict Reggie can cure Jim.Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He cannot go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim "picked up a game" now and then, is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity, which ultimately ends with Jim's incarceration in a state penitentiary. After months in the hospital, he gets out and later does a talk show about his drug life, but before that he turned down free drugs given to him by his old friend, Pedro.Jim started out as a practice basketball player, and moved on to writing his memoirs. Although it masquerades as a cautionary tale about the horrors of heroin, this epic of teen-age angst is more accurately seen as a reverential wallow in the gutter of self-absorption.One thing about the plot is that the view never understand what really motivated this intelligent adolescent, a gifted basketball player and sensitive writer, to descend into the hellish life of a drug addict and hustler on the mean streets of New York.It only showed how drugs can destroy one's life.As for the movie,it was a must-see as you get a glimpse of the great actor Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be.

    There was a huge uproar regarding this movie because of a scene where the main character walks into his classroom and starts gunning everybody down with a shotgun. As is typical everybody has missed the whole point of the movie. It is not designed to encourage school shootings, but to show people what heroin is really like. When it comes to violence on television and video games then I will repeat what was said to me once, not that anybody will listen - people are so stubborn that once that have a mindset, no amount of reason will change their mind. Anyway, before television there was an awful lot of violence - the Napoleonic Wars, the thirty years war, the crusades, and even World War I: probably one of the most violent of wars. Even then before literature or even the written language, Cain killed Abel, and he did not do it because a video game made him think that it was a good idea. Violence is apart of our nature and we do it because we are frustrated with the world and the way people react to us. It is basic to our nature, and I am not saying that it is alright, but rather stopping violence in the media is not going to change anything. The Basketball Diaries is about a heroin addict. We follow his life from when he becomes one to when he finally gives up. Even though he does not start off as a heroin addict, he is still taking drugs, or rather sniffing glue. He, Jim Carol, hangs with three other friends and they simply act like teenagers with a lot of energy. Jim is also a champion basketball player. There is a darker side to his life and that is that his best friend is dying of Leukemia. He does not want to believe it, but it is reality and once he dies things slowly begin to change. We are not sure what really happens, but I guess it has something to do with the realisation that they are no longer immortal. But that is not the main reason, it more has to do with the pain and the loss that he suffers after his friend dies, and it is not something that they could have fought against - in fact he was powerless to do anything about it. The realisation of ones weakness is a true humbliser. Starting the addiction is not focused that heavily on in the movie, but his first trip is, and it shows him running through a field of flowers. It is more that he describes how all of his pain has gone away - both the emotional and the physical. This is the thing about Heroin - it is one of the world's best painkillers, but it is also an incredibly addictive drug. What we see is how his life collapses around him as he becomes addicted to Heroin. He is kicked out of school, slowly looses his friends as they are each arrested for various crimes, and finally he himself is taken away as he lies in a pathetic heap before the door to his mothers' apartment. Near the end we even see him resort of Homosexuality, something that horrifies him, especially when he is molested by the basketball coach, to get money for drugs. This is further undermined when the drugs he purchases are fake. The Basketball Diaries is an incredible movie and shows something that we wish to ignore. The school shooting scene is not all that bad, and more shows his frustration with life and the way the drugs take away this frustration - but at a cost. It is something that has been taken right out of proportion and as such people take the wrong idea about the film.

    Jim Carroll's The Basketball Diaries tells in tattered detail how the author went in a few short months from being a Catholic high school basketball star to being a strung-out heroin addict who turned tricks for drugs. Like many such stories, it hangs fondly over the shock and repulsion, and ends with unbecoming quickness after contentment is recovered. Will there ever be a venue for a film about a character who skips through his drug period because he's so excited to show us what he did after he pulled his socks up? Not likely. If there's anything more tiresome than a scandalous parable with a lesson at the end, it's the lesson minus the parable. And so this reverential flounder in the sewer of narcissism shows us profusely that if you become addicted to drugs, you're prone to discover yourself living distraughtly on the streets, selling a body that looks increasingly less like a worthwhile purchase. Carroll was a kid who notwithstanding his misery attempted to develop his experience into prose. The snag with Scott Kalvert's film is that he's apt to translate the experiences too literally: Jim is so urgently pale and miserable that the idealism feels vain. He plays basketball at night in the rain after his best friend dies of leukemia, and it just looks wholly contrived, fake and banal, not poignant. As the film begins, Jim is on the basketball team at a Catholic high school in New York, where a depraved priest drools while spanking disobedient students with a full-size paddle and the class cringes rhythmically. This scene's more indebted to Victorian pornography than to any real private school in 20th century America. Jim and his friends are not upright Catholic boys. They steal from the lockers of the opposing basketball team, and the preferred off-court activity is experimenting with inhalants and pills. Swifty, the coach played by Bruno Kirby, makes implausible passes at Jim. And Jim's mother, played by a sadly wasted Lorraine Bracco, is a crudely flat character who functions here exclusively to implement tough love by kicking him out. Life for Jim is a descending coil of pills, cough medicine, booze, diving off cliffs into the Harlem River, fainting during a game and masturbating on the roof. There are also stirring gleans into the underbelly of users, pushers, hookers and pimps, as Jim floats at large from his comfort zones, while recording all in his diary. Jim's writing predictably operates as a narration. Like most poetry written by teenagers, it's childish idealism, agonizingly earnest, seeing life as sad because the writer's not happy. Soon though, he samples heroin, and "any ache, pain, sadness or guilt was completely flushed out." Remarkable, how real life unravels exactly like the movies. The movie hinges on three hard-wearing formulas: Jim facilitates his dying friend's temporary escape from the hospital so he can push his wheelchair down 42nd Street, Jim sees his ex-teammate on TV playing in an all-star game while Jim is in a squalid bar and, of course, Jim is rescued by a dignified black man, who finds him out cold, brings him home and puts him through cold turkey. In accounts like this, you can continuously rely on a laudable black ex-hoodlum, combing the streets for distressed white kids, functioning for white tolerance soap-boxing purposes as hidden supplies of authenticity and honor. DiCaprio does what he can with the role. Ernie Hudson is solid as the ex-junkie, and there is genuine feeling in Bracco's underwritten mother. But it's Juliette Lewis, as a greasy hooker, who once again taps an utterly real edge. But the movie is not credible. By the end, Jim is seen going in through a stage door, and then we hear him telling the story of his decline and recuperation. We can't determine if this is intended to be actual acknowledgment or a show: That's the whole movie's trouble. While the film has a preachy earnestness more like older films that take drug issues in hand, its mercilessly murky concentration on the despair of drug abuse makes for effective, gripping viewing, if only for purely morbid interest. The teen years, an age of revolt and insecurity in the best of conditions, can be shocking when an individual gets that carried away. This stark, muddled film depicts this, with reductive prurience indeed, but also with brutalizing efficacy.

    Basketball Diaries, The (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Powerful adaptation of Jim Carroll's autobiographical account of his free fall from good student to heroin addict isn't a pretty film to watch but there's no denying its power. Leonard DiCaprio, in his first starring role, plays Carroll who when we first meet him is playing sports and is still in school but soon his minor drug habits start to spin out of control and he finds himself hooked, living on the streets and any hope for the future is nearly gone. I remember going to see THE BASKETBALL DIARIES a week after my fifteenth birthday and still remember what effect it had on me. I really didn't understand all the negative reviews the movie got at the time of its release but I found the film to be remarkably powerful and the message against drug abuse is still very strong in today's time. What all people then agreed on is that star DiCaprio seemed like he could do anything in the world. Coming after supporting roles in films like THIS BOYS LIFE and WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, this was certainly a departure from those two films but it was a real eye-opener because there's some of the most raw and powerful acting that you're ever going to see. The final thirty-minutes of the film pretty much has DiCaprio playing a drugged out character who is just inches away from death and the brutality of the performance is something one isn't going to forget. This is hands down a performance that once you see it it's unlikely to leave your mind and DiCaprio really gives it his all and it's really hard to think of another actor out there who could have given so much to the part. The way DiCaprio just crumbles under the drug abuse is so chilling and haunting that you really do feel as if you're watching a real addict and not just an actor playing a part. The support cast are also quite good with Ernie Hudson coming off extremely strong as a man trying to save the kid and Lorraine Bracco as his mother. Mark Wahlberg, Bruno Kirby and Juliette Lewis are also strong in their roles. I think there are a few issues with the film including too much attempted style by the director and this is really apparent during a sequence where DiCaprio is suffering from withdrawals. The acting is strong enough so the stylistic touches by the director are more distracting than anything else. The screenplay has taken some heat from people but I thought it was pretty good and captured the free-spirit of the novel, which it's based on. THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is as relevant today as it was when first released and it's certainly a terrific showcase for its star who has gone on to prove all those early critics right when they called him one of the greatest actors coming up. The film is a haunting reminder of the downsides of drugs and the rawness of the performances make it hard to watch at times but there's no denying its power.

    I watched this film recently with my girlfriend and several friends having not seen it since around the time when it first came out. I remember at the time thinking how powerful a performance Leonardo Dicaprio gave of Jim Carrol's real life character. The performance was so good I remember at the time telling friends who had recently seen Titanic, that they will be shocked by this performance as it proved he is one of the most versatile actors in cinema today and then. Over the years I have told people I have met, you need to see this movie but not many have and it seems to have sneaked under the radar a little. Therefore when It was on television recently I made everyone watch this film. Everyone who did came back to me saying the same thing, 'wasn't leo good in it'!! The scenes involving Carrol begging his mother to let him into the apartment so he can ask for money to help feed his drug habit are shockingly powerful. Its an amazing portrayal of the dangers of drug addiction and how it can effect young people who dabble with the dangers so quickly, turning their lives on its head with out them realising how it even happened. some strong messages in this film that many teenagers need to watch. Having watched it again some years later, It has dated slightly in time but not only Leo is outstanding but Mark Whalberg shows that he too was showing potential back then 15 years ago or so. I have never been too sure of Whalberg in the past sometimes mixing natural acting ability in movies such as 'the fighter' or his interesting performance of the character police detective 'dignam' in the departed with shocking performances such as 'the happening or Planet of the Apes (where to be honest I don't blame him but the directors for poor casting). But Wharlberg in this movie shows genuine class, perhaps portraying a young man who had an adolecence pretty similar to his diaries character 'mickey'. on a whole the film is a class act and hidden gem. A must see.

    I thought "The Basketball Diaries" was a really good book, but this particular screen translation was bungled. Though a diary, the book is surprisingly well-written considering the author wrote it in his early teens, and it provides a great deal of insight into the world of Irish-Catholic youth in New York City during the 1960's. It's all real, but it reads like a good novel (I honestly liked it a lot more than "The Catcher in the Rye," and even "Junkie" by William S. Burroughs). It is also incredibly graphic, particularly in how it deals with Carroll prostituting himself to support his heroin addiction. I can't think of a single novel written by an adult about teenage life that has balls like that. The problem with the movie is that it totally misses the point of the book. Since Carroll is writing about himself, the book is completely non-judgemental. It simply documents the events. The movie, on the other hand, is like the after-school special version of the book. DiCaprio's character tries heroin, and in the very next scene, he's a filthy bum living in an alleyway. No insight is provided into heroin addiction at all; it's simply more Reagan-era "Just say no" religious crap. The ending in the book is also much bleaker than the ending in the film, which actually ends about 2/3rds of the way through the book, if I remember correctly. I do think the actors in the film were all terrific, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives a surprisingly mature performance. Ernie Hudson was also great, and the photography was gorgeous. But the movie itself just sucks. Read the book instead.

    Ever since hearing the commentary track of Paul Thomas Anderson for the Boogie Nights DVD (I heard it like in early 2008), this title, Scott Kalvert's The Basketball Diaries, came to stay in my mind. I really love the way P.T. Anderson, like Tarantino or now Edgar Wright, talks about his influences, about film in general, and in this case after hearing that he cast Mark Walhberg after seeing his performance in The Basketball Diaries ("god, he was good, god, I though he was so good" Â– and Mark made sure P.T. Anderson wanted him for his acting and not for his body!) definitely made me want to check it out (I Am Cuba is another of the titles that stayed with me thanks to that commentary. I still have to watch it tough). And P.T. Anderson explains that actually his first choice for that part was Leonardo DiCaprio. He doesn't specify, but it's very probable that DiCaprio became his choice also due to The Basketball Diaries (however he decided to do Titanic instead). Anyway, there is not a R4 DVD around that I know, so it was until some weeks ago, when I found on ebay a really cheap R1 DVD of it, when I sort of recall everything and finally got it. When you see a movie with the title of "The Basketball Diaries" and a very young DiCaprio, I mean, a young blonde kid in school clothes in its DVD cover you may not think of it as something really interesting. Definitely you don't think of it as a strong movie about the consequences of drug addiction. This is a movie that deals with the downfall of some very talented young basketball players. It has few to offer for those seeking for a straight sports movie though. We learn that our characters really can play basketball, and pretty much that's it. This is really a straight drug movie. And it's a really good one even though it doesn't really add something "brand-new" to the drug movie sort of formula (but we probably have here the basketball game with the most doped players. That scene features the Doors' "Riders on the Storm", which is pretty cool indeed). My sort of analogy goes with the thing that DiCaprio became like a different actor once he began working with Martin Scorsese back in 2002. He definitely left Titanic behind. Maybe before Scorsese but hell, since Gangs of New York I, at least, see a different DiCaprio. So here in The Basketball Diaries we have like the two DiCaprio. The movie at first sight is a coming of age one with the Titanic DiCaprio suffering the type of education that his Catholic school gives but also having fun with his friends (all are part of a great Catholic basketball team that is pretty much invincible) and stuff; it's a "kids being kids" kind of story. Once the movie gets much darker we get to see the Scorsese DiCaprio. Somehow some scenes really make see the very intense DiCaprio from the Scorsese films. It was a surprise to have him here doing something like that, two years before Titanic (I have yet to see What's Eating Gilbert Grape, for which he earned his first Oscar nomination back in 1994). This is worth watching stuff.

    Based on the autobiographical novel written by Jim Carroll, The Basketball Diaries follows one young man's descent into addiction, crime and homelessness. Jim (here played with mature dedication by Leonardo Di Caprio) is a promising high school basketball player, who along with his three friends, enjoy shooting hoops and getting into general mischief. What starts out as a past-time, soon deteriorates into something more deprived and desperate, as Jim sees his world crash around him as his drug habit becomes an unstoppable affliction. When Jim's situation gets so desperate that he leaves home to hustle and rob on the streets, he begins to push away the people in his life that were once close to him. His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, throws him out after the extremities of his situation become apparent to her and refuses him back. Reggie (Ernie Hudson) was an inspirational figure and mentor to Jim and regularly met up to play basketball in the court. And Neutron (Patrick McGaw) distances himself from Jim and his friends' habits and focuses on his basketball career, much to Jim's dismay. These people will all have a profound effect on Jim's eventual redemption. The film also switches the book's real-life setting from 1960's New York to the 90's. What The Basketball Diaries attempts to do is to create a realistic and gritty (a phrase that seems to be thrown around a lot these days) depiction of drug abuse, and create a hellish portrait of a confused young man who his throwing away his many talents in favour of a life that is doing nothing but ruining his life and isolating the people around him. In reality, this is a terribly-directed film that seems to sledgehammer the phrase 'drugs are bad' into the viewers skull, rather than having the nerve, or in deed the respect, to let the audience make their own mind up. Or maybe the director doesn't have the skill to create a film capable of conjuring up those feelings in the viewer. It sounds ridiculous, but if you have seen the South Park episode where Mr Mackey is giving his anti-drug lecture by simply listing the drugs that are 'bad', then you can see a clear parallel to this film. Jim basically goes from one drug to the other and one crime to the next. It's not interesting, convincing, and to be honest I found it all just very annoying. Jim is a character of no redeeming qualities. He's selfish, careless, and is basically a whiny little kid. Fair enough, this is a chance to develop an interesting, fully-rounded character, but director Scott Kalvert and scriptwriter Bryan Goluboff cannot combine their 'skills' to pull it off. Even though Jim narrates the film and reveals everything about his feelings and opinions, and Di Caprio's fantastic performance, we never get inside Jim's head enough to understand him and why he is willing to give up on a fledging basketball career. This is a character that we're supposed to be praying for to overcome his addiction, but (spoilers!) when his clean-break arrived, I asked myself should I be feeling happy for this arsehole? A well-acted film all-round, namely from the lead and Mark Wahlberg as his friend Mickey, but a film that is swamped in faults and scenes that are just ridiculous. Possibly only remotely remembered for the controversial scene where Jim storms his school with a shotgun in a drug-addled fantasy, which was caught up in the media storm surrounding the Columbine High School massacre. Watch only for signs of early promise from Di Caprio, but otherwise avoid. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    The Basketball Diaries is the movie that showed exactly how much acting potential Leonardo DiCaprio has. The good. Gripping sad story. Extreme realism and superb acting, you really get into their shoes, very immersive. You get to understand their story, their situation. Tight well executed scenes. Nice camera work. Solid score. The actors. Not only does Leonardo DiCaprio shine like a true star, but Mark Wahlberg also shows his talent. The rest of the cast is almost as impeccable. The bad. The end scene on the stage is badly staged. No pun intended. It's a bit awkward, but it's easily forgivable. The ugly. It pictures drugs as a social disease whereas their use is actually a symptom of an underlying problem. But then, everybody thinks that, because that's the official story. The result. It's a forbidding tale, but everyone should watch it and understand.

    This film isn't for everyone, you either hate it or love it. It sometimes lacks that constant up-beat easy to watch feel that certain types of audiences need to enjoy a film and is replaced with brutal honesty.The performances from all of the actors were outstanding, with Leonardo DiCaprio performing some of the best acting I have ever seen. His portrayal of Jim was so real and raw that he gave so much of himself to the role that it began to look effortless. So many scenes in this movie were beautifully done. A few stand out moments to name: The basketball scene in the rain, every confrontation between Jim and his mother, and the Withdrawal scene where once again Leo gives a spine tingling performance. If you want to enjoy The Basketball diaries you must go into it with an open mind and take the film for what it is. It isn't a fancy, modern, stylized, glamorized film about drugs but rather an honest, raw, bold and touching movie about the self-destruction of a boy who falls head first into the harrowing world of drug addiction. This movie for me is an overlooked, underrated piece of art. Which is why I love it. I wouldn't change one thing about it.

    There was a huge uproar regarding this movie because of a scene where the main character walks into his classroom and starts gunning everybody down with a shotgun. As is typical everybody has missed the whole point of the movie. It is not designed to encourage school shootings, but to show people what heroin is really like. When it comes to violence on television and video games then I will repeat what was said to me once, not that anybody will listen - people are so stubborn that once that have a mindset, no amount of reason will change their mind. Anyway, before television there was an awful lot of violence - the Napoleonic Wars, the thirty years war, the crusades, and even World War I: probably one of the most violent of wars. Even then before literature or even the written language, Cain killed Abel, and he did not do it because a video game made him think that it was a good idea. Violence is apart of our nature and we do it because we are frustrated with the world and the way people react to us. It is basic to our nature, and I am not saying that it is alright, but rather stopping violence in the media is not going to change anything. The Basketball Diaries is about a heroin addict. We follow his life from when he becomes one to when he finally gives up. Even though he does not start off as a heroin addict, he is still taking drugs, or rather sniffing glue. He, Jim Carol, hangs with three other friends and they simply act like teenagers with a lot of energy. Jim is also a champion basketball player. There is a darker side to his life and that is that his best friend is dying of Leukemia. He does not want to believe it, but it is reality and once he dies things slowly begin to change. We are not sure what really happens, but I guess it has something to do with the realisation that they are no longer immortal. But that is not the main reason, it more has to do with the pain and the loss that he suffers after his friend dies, and it is not something that they could have fought against - in fact he was powerless to do anything about it. The realisation of ones weakness is a true humbliser. Starting the addiction is not focused that heavily on in the movie, but his first trip is, and it shows him running through a field of flowers. It is more that he describes how all of his pain has gone away - both the emotional and the physical. This is the thing about Heroin - it is one of the world's best painkillers, but it is also an incredibly addictive drug. What we see is how his life collapses around him as he becomes addicted to Heroin. He is kicked out of school, slowly looses his friends as they are each arrested for various crimes, and finally he himself is taken away as he lies in a pathetic heap before the door to his mothers' apartment. Near the end we even see him resort of Homosexuality, something that horrifies him, especially when he is molested by the basketball coach, to get money for drugs. This is further undermined when the drugs he purchases are fake. The Basketball Diaries is an incredible movie and shows something that we wish to ignore. The school shooting scene is not all that bad, and more shows his frustration with life and the way the drugs take away this frustration - but at a cost. It is something that has been taken right out of proportion and as such people take the wrong idea about the film.

    Jim Carroll's The Basketball Diaries tells in tattered detail how the author went in a few short months from being a Catholic high school basketball star to being a strung-out heroin addict who turned tricks for drugs. Like many such stories, it hangs fondly over the shock and repulsion, and ends with unbecoming quickness after contentment is recovered. Will there ever be a venue for a film about a character who skips through his drug period because he's so excited to show us what he did after he pulled his socks up? Not likely. If there's anything more tiresome than a scandalous parable with a lesson at the end, it's the lesson minus the parable. And so this reverential flounder in the sewer of narcissism shows us profusely that if you become addicted to drugs, you're prone to discover yourself living distraughtly on the streets, selling a body that looks increasingly less like a worthwhile purchase. Carroll was a kid who notwithstanding his misery attempted to develop his experience into prose. The snag with Scott Kalvert's film is that he's apt to translate the experiences too literally: Jim is so urgently pale and miserable that the idealism feels vain. He plays basketball at night in the rain after his best friend dies of leukemia, and it just looks wholly contrived, fake and banal, not poignant. As the film begins, Jim is on the basketball team at a Catholic high school in New York, where a depraved priest drools while spanking disobedient students with a full-size paddle and the class cringes rhythmically. This scene's more indebted to Victorian pornography than to any real private school in 20th century America. Jim and his friends are not upright Catholic boys. They steal from the lockers of the opposing basketball team, and the preferred off-court activity is experimenting with inhalants and pills. Swifty, the coach played by Bruno Kirby, makes implausible passes at Jim. And Jim's mother, played by a sadly wasted Lorraine Bracco, is a crudely flat character who functions here exclusively to implement tough love by kicking him out. Life for Jim is a descending coil of pills, cough medicine, booze, diving off cliffs into the Harlem River, fainting during a game and masturbating on the roof. There are also stirring gleans into the underbelly of users, pushers, hookers and pimps, as Jim floats at large from his comfort zones, while recording all in his diary. Jim's writing predictably operates as a narration. Like most poetry written by teenagers, it's childish idealism, agonizingly earnest, seeing life as sad because the writer's not happy. Soon though, he samples heroin, and "any ache, pain, sadness or guilt was completely flushed out." Remarkable, how real life unravels exactly like the movies. The movie hinges on three hard-wearing formulas: Jim facilitates his dying friend's temporary escape from the hospital so he can push his wheelchair down 42nd Street, Jim sees his ex-teammate on TV playing in an all-star game while Jim is in a squalid bar and, of course, Jim is rescued by a dignified black man, who finds him out cold, brings him home and puts him through cold turkey. In accounts like this, you can continuously rely on a laudable black ex-hoodlum, combing the streets for distressed white kids, functioning for white tolerance soap-boxing purposes as hidden supplies of authenticity and honor. DiCaprio does what he can with the role. Ernie Hudson is solid as the ex-junkie, and there is genuine feeling in Bracco's underwritten mother. But it's Juliette Lewis, as a greasy hooker, who once again taps an utterly real edge. But the movie is not credible. By the end, Jim is seen going in through a stage door, and then we hear him telling the story of his decline and recuperation. We can't determine if this is intended to be actual acknowledgment or a show: That's the whole movie's trouble. While the film has a preachy earnestness more like older films that take drug issues in hand, its mercilessly murky concentration on the despair of drug abuse makes for effective, gripping viewing, if only for purely morbid interest. The teen years, an age of revolt and insecurity in the best of conditions, can be shocking when an individual gets that carried away. This stark, muddled film depicts this, with reductive prurience indeed, but also with brutalizing efficacy.

    Basketball Diaries, The (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Powerful adaptation of Jim Carroll's autobiographical account of his free fall from good student to heroin addict isn't a pretty film to watch but there's no denying its power. Leonard DiCaprio, in his first starring role, plays Carroll who when we first meet him is playing sports and is still in school but soon his minor drug habits start to spin out of control and he finds himself hooked, living on the streets and any hope for the future is nearly gone. I remember going to see THE BASKETBALL DIARIES a week after my fifteenth birthday and still remember what effect it had on me. I really didn't understand all the negative reviews the movie got at the time of its release but I found the film to be remarkably powerful and the message against drug abuse is still very strong in today's time. What all people then agreed on is that star DiCaprio seemed like he could do anything in the world. Coming after supporting roles in films like THIS BOYS LIFE and WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, this was certainly a departure from those two films but it was a real eye-opener because there's some of the most raw and powerful acting that you're ever going to see. The final thirty-minutes of the film pretty much has DiCaprio playing a drugged out character who is just inches away from death and the brutality of the performance is something one isn't going to forget. This is hands down a performance that once you see it it's unlikely to leave your mind and DiCaprio really gives it his all and it's really hard to think of another actor out there who could have given so much to the part. The way DiCaprio just crumbles under the drug abuse is so chilling and haunting that you really do feel as if you're watching a real addict and not just an actor playing a part. The support cast are also quite good with Ernie Hudson coming off extremely strong as a man trying to save the kid and Lorraine Bracco as his mother. Mark Wahlberg, Bruno Kirby and Juliette Lewis are also strong in their roles. I think there are a few issues with the film including too much attempted style by the director and this is really apparent during a sequence where DiCaprio is suffering from withdrawals. The acting is strong enough so the stylistic touches by the director are more distracting than anything else. The screenplay has taken some heat from people but I thought it was pretty good and captured the free-spirit of the novel, which it's based on. THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is as relevant today as it was when first released and it's certainly a terrific showcase for its star who has gone on to prove all those early critics right when they called him one of the greatest actors coming up. The film is a haunting reminder of the downsides of drugs and the rawness of the performances make it hard to watch at times but there's no denying its power.

    I watched this film recently with my girlfriend and several friends having not seen it since around the time when it first came out. I remember at the time thinking how powerful a performance Leonardo Dicaprio gave of Jim Carrol's real life character. The performance was so good I remember at the time telling friends who had recently seen Titanic, that they will be shocked by this performance as it proved he is one of the most versatile actors in cinema today and then. Over the years I have told people I have met, you need to see this movie but not many have and it seems to have sneaked under the radar a little. Therefore when It was on television recently I made everyone watch this film. Everyone who did came back to me saying the same thing, 'wasn't leo good in it'!! The scenes involving Carrol begging his mother to let him into the apartment so he can ask for money to help feed his drug habit are shockingly powerful. Its an amazing portrayal of the dangers of drug addiction and how it can effect young people who dabble with the dangers so quickly, turning their lives on its head with out them realising how it even happened. some strong messages in this film that many teenagers need to watch. Having watched it again some years later, It has dated slightly in time but not only Leo is outstanding but Mark Whalberg shows that he too was showing potential back then 15 years ago or so. I have never been too sure of Whalberg in the past sometimes mixing natural acting ability in movies such as 'the fighter' or his interesting performance of the character police detective 'dignam' in the departed with shocking performances such as 'the happening or Planet of the Apes (where to be honest I don't blame him but the directors for poor casting). But Wharlberg in this movie shows genuine class, perhaps portraying a young man who had an adolecence pretty similar to his diaries character 'mickey'. on a whole the film is a class act and hidden gem. A must see.

    I thought "The Basketball Diaries" was a really good book, but this particular screen translation was bungled. Though a diary, the book is surprisingly well-written considering the author wrote it in his early teens, and it provides a great deal of insight into the world of Irish-Catholic youth in New York City during the 1960's. It's all real, but it reads like a good novel (I honestly liked it a lot more than "The Catcher in the Rye," and even "Junkie" by William S. Burroughs). It is also incredibly graphic, particularly in how it deals with Carroll prostituting himself to support his heroin addiction. I can't think of a single novel written by an adult about teenage life that has balls like that. The problem with the movie is that it totally misses the point of the book. Since Carroll is writing about himself, the book is completely non-judgemental. It simply documents the events. The movie, on the other hand, is like the after-school special version of the book. DiCaprio's character tries heroin, and in the very next scene, he's a filthy bum living in an alleyway. No insight is provided into heroin addiction at all; it's simply more Reagan-era "Just say no" religious crap. The ending in the book is also much bleaker than the ending in the film, which actually ends about 2/3rds of the way through the book, if I remember correctly. I do think the actors in the film were all terrific, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives a surprisingly mature performance. Ernie Hudson was also great, and the photography was gorgeous. But the movie itself just sucks. Read the book instead.

    Ever since hearing the commentary track of Paul Thomas Anderson for the Boogie Nights DVD (I heard it like in early 2008), this title, Scott Kalvert's The Basketball Diaries, came to stay in my mind. I really love the way P.T. Anderson, like Tarantino or now Edgar Wright, talks about his influences, about film in general, and in this case after hearing that he cast Mark Walhberg after seeing his performance in The Basketball Diaries ("god, he was good, god, I though he was so good" Â– and Mark made sure P.T. Anderson wanted him for his acting and not for his body!) definitely made me want to check it out (I Am Cuba is another of the titles that stayed with me thanks to that commentary. I still have to watch it tough). And P.T. Anderson explains that actually his first choice for that part was Leonardo DiCaprio. He doesn't specify, but it's very probable that DiCaprio became his choice also due to The Basketball Diaries (however he decided to do Titanic instead). Anyway, there is not a R4 DVD around that I know, so it was until some weeks ago, when I found on ebay a really cheap R1 DVD of it, when I sort of recall everything and finally got it. When you see a movie with the title of "The Basketball Diaries" and a very young DiCaprio, I mean, a young blonde kid in school clothes in its DVD cover you may not think of it as something really interesting. Definitely you don't think of it as a strong movie about the consequences of drug addiction. This is a movie that deals with the downfall of some very talented young basketball players. It has few to offer for those seeking for a straight sports movie though. We learn that our characters really can play basketball, and pretty much that's it. This is really a straight drug movie. And it's a really good one even though it doesn't really add something "brand-new" to the drug movie sort of formula (but we probably have here the basketball game with the most doped players. That scene features the Doors' "Riders on the Storm", which is pretty cool indeed). My sort of analogy goes with the thing that DiCaprio became like a different actor once he began working with Martin Scorsese back in 2002. He definitely left Titanic behind. Maybe before Scorsese but hell, since Gangs of New York I, at least, see a different DiCaprio. So here in The Basketball Diaries we have like the two DiCaprio. The movie at first sight is a coming of age one with the Titanic DiCaprio suffering the type of education that his Catholic school gives but also having fun with his friends (all are part of a great Catholic basketball team that is pretty much invincible) and stuff; it's a "kids being kids" kind of story. Once the movie gets much darker we get to see the Scorsese DiCaprio. Somehow some scenes really make see the very intense DiCaprio from the Scorsese films. It was a surprise to have him here doing something like that, two years before Titanic (I have yet to see What's Eating Gilbert Grape, for which he earned his first Oscar nomination back in 1994). This is worth watching stuff.

    Based on the autobiographical novel written by Jim Carroll, The Basketball Diaries follows one young man's descent into addiction, crime and homelessness. Jim (here played with mature dedication by Leonardo Di Caprio) is a promising high school basketball player, who along with his three friends, enjoy shooting hoops and getting into general mischief. What starts out as a past-time, soon deteriorates into something more deprived and desperate, as Jim sees his world crash around him as his drug habit becomes an unstoppable affliction. When Jim's situation gets so desperate that he leaves home to hustle and rob on the streets, he begins to push away the people in his life that were once close to him. His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, throws him out after the extremities of his situation become apparent to her and refuses him back. Reggie (Ernie Hudson) was an inspirational figure and mentor to Jim and regularly met up to play basketball in the court. And Neutron (Patrick McGaw) distances himself from Jim and his friends' habits and focuses on his basketball career, much to Jim's dismay. These people will all have a profound effect on Jim's eventual redemption. The film also switches the book's real-life setting from 1960's New York to the 90's. What The Basketball Diaries attempts to do is to create a realistic and gritty (a phrase that seems to be thrown around a lot these days) depiction of drug abuse, and create a hellish portrait of a confused young man who his throwing away his many talents in favour of a life that is doing nothing but ruining his life and isolating the people around him. In reality, this is a terribly-directed film that seems to sledgehammer the phrase 'drugs are bad' into the viewers skull, rather than having the nerve, or in deed the respect, to let the audience make their own mind up. Or maybe the director doesn't have the skill to create a film capable of conjuring up those feelings in the viewer. It sounds ridiculous, but if you have seen the South Park episode where Mr Mackey is giving his anti-drug lecture by simply listing the drugs that are 'bad', then you can see a clear parallel to this film. Jim basically goes from one drug to the other and one crime to the next. It's not interesting, convincing, and to be honest I found it all just very annoying. Jim is a character of no redeeming qualities. He's selfish, careless, and is basically a whiny little kid. Fair enough, this is a chance to develop an interesting, fully-rounded character, but director Scott Kalvert and scriptwriter Bryan Goluboff cannot combine their 'skills' to pull it off. Even though Jim narrates the film and reveals everything about his feelings and opinions, and Di Caprio's fantastic performance, we never get inside Jim's head enough to understand him and why he is willing to give up on a fledging basketball career. This is a character that we're supposed to be praying for to overcome his addiction, but (spoilers!) when his clean-break arrived, I asked myself should I be feeling happy for this arsehole? A well-acted film all-round, namely from the lead and Mark Wahlberg as his friend Mickey, but a film that is swamped in faults and scenes that are just ridiculous. Possibly only remotely remembered for the controversial scene where Jim storms his school with a shotgun in a drug-addled fantasy, which was caught up in the media storm surrounding the Columbine High School massacre. Watch only for signs of early promise from Di Caprio, but otherwise avoid. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    The Basketball Diaries is the movie that showed exactly how much acting potential Leonardo DiCaprio has. The good. Gripping sad story. Extreme realism and superb acting, you really get into their shoes, very immersive. You get to understand their story, their situation. Tight well executed scenes. Nice camera work. Solid score. The actors. Not only does Leonardo DiCaprio shine like a true star, but Mark Wahlberg also shows his talent. The rest of the cast is almost as impeccable. The bad. The end scene on the stage is badly staged. No pun intended. It's a bit awkward, but it's easily forgivable. The ugly. It pictures drugs as a social disease whereas their use is actually a symptom of an underlying problem. But then, everybody thinks that, because that's the official story. The result. It's a forbidding tale, but everyone should watch it and understand.

    This film isn't for everyone, you either hate it or love it. It sometimes lacks that constant up-beat easy to watch feel that certain types of audiences need to enjoy a film and is replaced with brutal honesty.The performances from all of the actors were outstanding, with Leonardo DiCaprio performing some of the best acting I have ever seen. His portrayal of Jim was so real and raw that he gave so much of himself to the role that it began to look effortless. So many scenes in this movie were beautifully done. A few stand out moments to name: The basketball scene in the rain, every confrontation between Jim and his mother, and the Withdrawal scene where once again Leo gives a spine tingling performance. If you want to enjoy The Basketball diaries you must go into it with an open mind and take the film for what it is. It isn't a fancy, modern, stylized, glamorized film about drugs but rather an honest, raw, bold and touching movie about the self-destruction of a boy who falls head first into the harrowing world of drug addiction. This movie for me is an overlooked, underrated piece of art. Which is why I love it. I wouldn't change one thing about it.

    Very loosely based on the memoir of the same name, The Basketball Diaries transposes the late '60s adolescence of writer and artist Jim Carroll to some unspecified time period at least 15 years later, further confusing the time frame with three decades of rock music, some by Carroll himself.The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Lorraine Bracco, James Madio, and Mark Wahlberg.It was directed by Scott Kalvert. Jim and his Catholic school chums are on the hottest basketball team in New York, but their friend Bobby languishes in the hospital with leukemia. In-between typically boyish adventures, Jim scribbles in his notebook and experiments with sex and drugs. His group of friends begins to disintegrate after coach Swifty not only makes a pass at Jim, but also catches him and his pals using drugs on the court and kicks them off the team. Out of school and on the streets, Jim turns tricks, betrays friends, robs stores, and deals drugs to feed his heroin addiction. Not even the efforts of former addict Reggie can cure Jim.Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He cannot go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim "picked up a game" now and then, is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity, which ultimately ends with Jim's incarceration in a state penitentiary. After months in the hospital, he gets out and later does a talk show about his drug life, but before that he turned down free drugs given to him by his old friend, Pedro.Jim started out as a practice basketball player, and moved on to writing his memoirs. Although it masquerades as a cautionary tale about the horrors of heroin, this epic of teen-age angst is more accurately seen as a reverential wallow in the gutter of self-absorption.One thing about the plot is that the view never understand what really motivated this intelligent adolescent, a gifted basketball player and sensitive writer, to descend into the hellish life of a drug addict and hustler on the mean streets of New York.It only showed how drugs can destroy one's life.As for the movie,it was a must-see as you get a glimpse of the great actor Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be.

    There was a huge uproar regarding this movie because of a scene where the main character walks into his classroom and starts gunning everybody down with a shotgun. As is typical everybody has missed the whole point of the movie. It is not designed to encourage school shootings, but to show people what heroin is really like. When it comes to violence on television and video games then I will repeat what was said to me once, not that anybody will listen - people are so stubborn that once that have a mindset, no amount of reason will change their mind. Anyway, before television there was an awful lot of violence - the Napoleonic Wars, the thirty years war, the crusades, and even World War I: probably one of the most violent of wars. Even then before literature or even the written language, Cain killed Abel, and he did not do it because a video game made him think that it was a good idea. Violence is apart of our nature and we do it because we are frustrated with the world and the way people react to us. It is basic to our nature, and I am not saying that it is alright, but rather stopping violence in the media is not going to change anything. The Basketball Diaries is about a heroin addict. We follow his life from when he becomes one to when he finally gives up. Even though he does not start off as a heroin addict, he is still taking drugs, or rather sniffing glue. He, Jim Carol, hangs with three other friends and they simply act like teenagers with a lot of energy. Jim is also a champion basketball player. There is a darker side to his life and that is that his best friend is dying of Leukemia. He does not want to believe it, but it is reality and once he dies things slowly begin to change. We are not sure what really happens, but I guess it has something to do with the realisation that they are no longer immortal. But that is not the main reason, it more has to do with the pain and the loss that he suffers after his friend dies, and it is not something that they could have fought against - in fact he was powerless to do anything about it. The realisation of ones weakness is a true humbliser. Starting the addiction is not focused that heavily on in the movie, but his first trip is, and it shows him running through a field of flowers. It is more that he describes how all of his pain has gone away - both the emotional and the physical. This is the thing about Heroin - it is one of the world's best painkillers, but it is also an incredibly addictive drug. What we see is how his life collapses around him as he becomes addicted to Heroin. He is kicked out of school, slowly looses his friends as they are each arrested for various crimes, and finally he himself is taken away as he lies in a pathetic heap before the door to his mothers' apartment. Near the end we even see him resort of Homosexuality, something that horrifies him, especially when he is molested by the basketball coach, to get money for drugs. This is further undermined when the drugs he purchases are fake. The Basketball Diaries is an incredible movie and shows something that we wish to ignore. The school shooting scene is not all that bad, and more shows his frustration with life and the way the drugs take away this frustration - but at a cost. It is something that has been taken right out of proportion and as such people take the wrong idea about the film.

    Jim Carroll's The Basketball Diaries tells in tattered detail how the author went in a few short months from being a Catholic high school basketball star to being a strung-out heroin addict who turned tricks for drugs. Like many such stories, it hangs fondly over the shock and repulsion, and ends with unbecoming quickness after contentment is recovered. Will there ever be a venue for a film about a character who skips through his drug period because he's so excited to show us what he did after he pulled his socks up? Not likely. If there's anything more tiresome than a scandalous parable with a lesson at the end, it's the lesson minus the parable. And so this reverential flounder in the sewer of narcissism shows us profusely that if you become addicted to drugs, you're prone to discover yourself living distraughtly on the streets, selling a body that looks increasingly less like a worthwhile purchase. Carroll was a kid who notwithstanding his misery attempted to develop his experience into prose. The snag with Scott Kalvert's film is that he's apt to translate the experiences too literally: Jim is so urgently pale and miserable that the idealism feels vain. He plays basketball at night in the rain after his best friend dies of leukemia, and it just looks wholly contrived, fake and banal, not poignant. As the film begins, Jim is on the basketball team at a Catholic high school in New York, where a depraved priest drools while spanking disobedient students with a full-size paddle and the class cringes rhythmically. This scene's more indebted to Victorian pornography than to any real private school in 20th century America. Jim and his friends are not upright Catholic boys. They steal from the lockers of the opposing basketball team, and the preferred off-court activity is experimenting with inhalants and pills. Swifty, the coach played by Bruno Kirby, makes implausible passes at Jim. And Jim's mother, played by a sadly wasted Lorraine Bracco, is a crudely flat character who functions here exclusively to implement tough love by kicking him out. Life for Jim is a descending coil of pills, cough medicine, booze, diving off cliffs into the Harlem River, fainting during a game and masturbating on the roof. There are also stirring gleans into the underbelly of users, pushers, hookers and pimps, as Jim floats at large from his comfort zones, while recording all in his diary. Jim's writing predictably operates as a narration. Like most poetry written by teenagers, it's childish idealism, agonizingly earnest, seeing life as sad because the writer's not happy. Soon though, he samples heroin, and "any ache, pain, sadness or guilt was completely flushed out." Remarkable, how real life unravels exactly like the movies. The movie hinges on three hard-wearing formulas: Jim facilitates his dying friend's temporary escape from the hospital so he can push his wheelchair down 42nd Street, Jim sees his ex-teammate on TV playing in an all-star game while Jim is in a squalid bar and, of course, Jim is rescued by a dignified black man, who finds him out cold, brings him home and puts him through cold turkey. In accounts like this, you can continuously rely on a laudable black ex-hoodlum, combing the streets for distressed white kids, functioning for white tolerance soap-boxing purposes as hidden supplies of authenticity and honor. DiCaprio does what he can with the role. Ernie Hudson is solid as the ex-junkie, and there is genuine feeling in Bracco's underwritten mother. But it's Juliette Lewis, as a greasy hooker, who once again taps an utterly real edge. But the movie is not credible. By the end, Jim is seen going in through a stage door, and then we hear him telling the story of his decline and recuperation. We can't determine if this is intended to be actual acknowledgment or a show: That's the whole movie's trouble. While the film has a preachy earnestness more like older films that take drug issues in hand, its mercilessly murky concentration on the despair of drug abuse makes for effective, gripping viewing, if only for purely morbid interest. The teen years, an age of revolt and insecurity in the best of conditions, can be shocking when an individual gets that carried away. This stark, muddled film depicts this, with reductive prurience indeed, but also with brutalizing efficacy.

    Basketball Diaries, The (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Powerful adaptation of Jim Carroll's autobiographical account of his free fall from good student to heroin addict isn't a pretty film to watch but there's no denying its power. Leonard DiCaprio, in his first starring role, plays Carroll who when we first meet him is playing sports and is still in school but soon his minor drug habits start to spin out of control and he finds himself hooked, living on the streets and any hope for the future is nearly gone. I remember going to see THE BASKETBALL DIARIES a week after my fifteenth birthday and still remember what effect it had on me. I really didn't understand all the negative reviews the movie got at the time of its release but I found the film to be remarkably powerful and the message against drug abuse is still very strong in today's time. What all people then agreed on is that star DiCaprio seemed like he could do anything in the world. Coming after supporting roles in films like THIS BOYS LIFE and WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, this was certainly a departure from those two films but it was a real eye-opener because there's some of the most raw and powerful acting that you're ever going to see. The final thirty-minutes of the film pretty much has DiCaprio playing a drugged out character who is just inches away from death and the brutality of the performance is something one isn't going to forget. This is hands down a performance that once you see it it's unlikely to leave your mind and DiCaprio really gives it his all and it's really hard to think of another actor out there who could have given so much to the part. The way DiCaprio just crumbles under the drug abuse is so chilling and haunting that you really do feel as if you're watching a real addict and not just an actor playing a part. The support cast are also quite good with Ernie Hudson coming off extremely strong as a man trying to save the kid and Lorraine Bracco as his mother. Mark Wahlberg, Bruno Kirby and Juliette Lewis are also strong in their roles. I think there are a few issues with the film including too much attempted style by the director and this is really apparent during a sequence where DiCaprio is suffering from withdrawals. The acting is strong enough so the stylistic touches by the director are more distracting than anything else. The screenplay has taken some heat from people but I thought it was pretty good and captured the free-spirit of the novel, which it's based on. THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is as relevant today as it was when first released and it's certainly a terrific showcase for its star who has gone on to prove all those early critics right when they called him one of the greatest actors coming up. The film is a haunting reminder of the downsides of drugs and the rawness of the performances make it hard to watch at times but there's no denying its power.

    I watched this film recently with my girlfriend and several friends having not seen it since around the time when it first came out. I remember at the time thinking how powerful a performance Leonardo Dicaprio gave of Jim Carrol's real life character. The performance was so good I remember at the time telling friends who had recently seen Titanic, that they will be shocked by this performance as it proved he is one of the most versatile actors in cinema today and then. Over the years I have told people I have met, you need to see this movie but not many have and it seems to have sneaked under the radar a little. Therefore when It was on television recently I made everyone watch this film. Everyone who did came back to me saying the same thing, 'wasn't leo good in it'!! The scenes involving Carrol begging his mother to let him into the apartment so he can ask for money to help feed his drug habit are shockingly powerful. Its an amazing portrayal of the dangers of drug addiction and how it can effect young people who dabble with the dangers so quickly, turning their lives on its head with out them realising how it even happened. some strong messages in this film that many teenagers need to watch. Having watched it again some years later, It has dated slightly in time but not only Leo is outstanding but Mark Whalberg shows that he too was showing potential back then 15 years ago or so. I have never been too sure of Whalberg in the past sometimes mixing natural acting ability in movies such as 'the fighter' or his interesting performance of the character police detective 'dignam' in the departed with shocking performances such as 'the happening or Planet of the Apes (where to be honest I don't blame him but the directors for poor casting). But Wharlberg in this movie shows genuine class, perhaps portraying a young man who had an adolecence pretty similar to his diaries character 'mickey'. on a whole the film is a class act and hidden gem. A must see.

    I thought "The Basketball Diaries" was a really good book, but this particular screen translation was bungled. Though a diary, the book is surprisingly well-written considering the author wrote it in his early teens, and it provides a great deal of insight into the world of Irish-Catholic youth in New York City during the 1960's. It's all real, but it reads like a good novel (I honestly liked it a lot more than "The Catcher in the Rye," and even "Junkie" by William S. Burroughs). It is also incredibly graphic, particularly in how it deals with Carroll prostituting himself to support his heroin addiction. I can't think of a single novel written by an adult about teenage life that has balls like that. The problem with the movie is that it totally misses the point of the book. Since Carroll is writing about himself, the book is completely non-judgemental. It simply documents the events. The movie, on the other hand, is like the after-school special version of the book. DiCaprio's character tries heroin, and in the very next scene, he's a filthy bum living in an alleyway. No insight is provided into heroin addiction at all; it's simply more Reagan-era "Just say no" religious crap. The ending in the book is also much bleaker than the ending in the film, which actually ends about 2/3rds of the way through the book, if I remember correctly. I do think the actors in the film were all terrific, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives a surprisingly mature performance. Ernie Hudson was also great, and the photography was gorgeous. But the movie itself just sucks. Read the book instead.

    Ever since hearing the commentary track of Paul Thomas Anderson for the Boogie Nights DVD (I heard it like in early 2008), this title, Scott Kalvert's The Basketball Diaries, came to stay in my mind. I really love the way P.T. Anderson, like Tarantino or now Edgar Wright, talks about his influences, about film in general, and in this case after hearing that he cast Mark Walhberg after seeing his performance in The Basketball Diaries ("god, he was good, god, I though he was so good" Â– and Mark made sure P.T. Anderson wanted him for his acting and not for his body!) definitely made me want to check it out (I Am Cuba is another of the titles that stayed with me thanks to that commentary. I still have to watch it tough). And P.T. Anderson explains that actually his first choice for that part was Leonardo DiCaprio. He doesn't specify, but it's very probable that DiCaprio became his choice also due to The Basketball Diaries (however he decided to do Titanic instead). Anyway, there is not a R4 DVD around that I know, so it was until some weeks ago, when I found on ebay a really cheap R1 DVD of it, when I sort of recall everything and finally got it. When you see a movie with the title of "The Basketball Diaries" and a very young DiCaprio, I mean, a young blonde kid in school clothes in its DVD cover you may not think of it as something really interesting. Definitely you don't think of it as a strong movie about the consequences of drug addiction. This is a movie that deals with the downfall of some very talented young basketball players. It has few to offer for those seeking for a straight sports movie though. We learn that our characters really can play basketball, and pretty much that's it. This is really a straight drug movie. And it's a really good one even though it doesn't really add something "brand-new" to the drug movie sort of formula (but we probably have here the basketball game with the most doped players. That scene features the Doors' "Riders on the Storm", which is pretty cool indeed). My sort of analogy goes with the thing that DiCaprio became like a different actor once he began working with Martin Scorsese back in 2002. He definitely left Titanic behind. Maybe before Scorsese but hell, since Gangs of New York I, at least, see a different DiCaprio. So here in The Basketball Diaries we have like the two DiCaprio. The movie at first sight is a coming of age one with the Titanic DiCaprio suffering the type of education that his Catholic school gives but also having fun with his friends (all are part of a great Catholic basketball team that is pretty much invincible) and stuff; it's a "kids being kids" kind of story. Once the movie gets much darker we get to see the Scorsese DiCaprio. Somehow some scenes really make see the very intense DiCaprio from the Scorsese films. It was a surprise to have him here doing something like that, two years before Titanic (I have yet to see What's Eating Gilbert Grape, for which he earned his first Oscar nomination back in 1994). This is worth watching stuff.

    Based on the autobiographical novel written by Jim Carroll, The Basketball Diaries follows one young man's descent into addiction, crime and homelessness. Jim (here played with mature dedication by Leonardo Di Caprio) is a promising high school basketball player, who along with his three friends, enjoy shooting hoops and getting into general mischief. What starts out as a past-time, soon deteriorates into something more deprived and desperate, as Jim sees his world crash around him as his drug habit becomes an unstoppable affliction. When Jim's situation gets so desperate that he leaves home to hustle and rob on the streets, he begins to push away the people in his life that were once close to him. His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, throws him out after the extremities of his situation become apparent to her and refuses him back. Reggie (Ernie Hudson) was an inspirational figure and mentor to Jim and regularly met up to play basketball in the court. And Neutron (Patrick McGaw) distances himself from Jim and his friends' habits and focuses on his basketball career, much to Jim's dismay. These people will all have a profound effect on Jim's eventual redemption. The film also switches the book's real-life setting from 1960's New York to the 90's. What The Basketball Diaries attempts to do is to create a realistic and gritty (a phrase that seems to be thrown around a lot these days) depiction of drug abuse, and create a hellish portrait of a confused young man who his throwing away his many talents in favour of a life that is doing nothing but ruining his life and isolating the people around him. In reality, this is a terribly-directed film that seems to sledgehammer the phrase 'drugs are bad' into the viewers skull, rather than having the nerve, or in deed the respect, to let the audience make their own mind up. Or maybe the director doesn't have the skill to create a film capable of conjuring up those feelings in the viewer. It sounds ridiculous, but if you have seen the South Park episode where Mr Mackey is giving his anti-drug lecture by simply listing the drugs that are 'bad', then you can see a clear parallel to this film. Jim basically goes from one drug to the other and one crime to the next. It's not interesting, convincing, and to be honest I found it all just very annoying. Jim is a character of no redeeming qualities. He's selfish, careless, and is basically a whiny little kid. Fair enough, this is a chance to develop an interesting, fully-rounded character, but director Scott Kalvert and scriptwriter Bryan Goluboff cannot combine their 'skills' to pull it off. Even though Jim narrates the film and reveals everything about his feelings and opinions, and Di Caprio's fantastic performance, we never get inside Jim's head enough to understand him and why he is willing to give up on a fledging basketball career. This is a character that we're supposed to be praying for to overcome his addiction, but (spoilers!) when his clean-break arrived, I asked myself should I be feeling happy for this arsehole? A well-acted film all-round, namely from the lead and Mark Wahlberg as his friend Mickey, but a film that is swamped in faults and scenes that are just ridiculous. Possibly only remotely remembered for the controversial scene where Jim storms his school with a shotgun in a drug-addled fantasy, which was caught up in the media storm surrounding the Columbine High School massacre. Watch only for signs of early promise from Di Caprio, but otherwise avoid. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    The Basketball Diaries is the movie that showed exactly how much acting potential Leonardo DiCaprio has. The good. Gripping sad story. Extreme realism and superb acting, you really get into their shoes, very immersive. You get to understand their story, their situation. Tight well executed scenes. Nice camera work. Solid score. The actors. Not only does Leonardo DiCaprio shine like a true star, but Mark Wahlberg also shows his talent. The rest of the cast is almost as impeccable. The bad. The end scene on the stage is badly staged. No pun intended. It's a bit awkward, but it's easily forgivable. The ugly. It pictures drugs as a social disease whereas their use is actually a symptom of an underlying problem. But then, everybody thinks that, because that's the official story. The result. It's a forbidding tale, but everyone should watch it and understand.

    This film isn't for everyone, you either hate it or love it. It sometimes lacks that constant up-beat easy to watch feel that certain types of audiences need to enjoy a film and is replaced with brutal honesty.The performances from all of the actors were outstanding, with Leonardo DiCaprio performing some of the best acting I have ever seen. His portrayal of Jim was so real and raw that he gave so much of himself to the role that it began to look effortless. So many scenes in this movie were beautifully done. A few stand out moments to name: The basketball scene in the rain, every confrontation between Jim and his mother, and the Withdrawal scene where once again Leo gives a spine tingling performance. If you want to enjoy The Basketball diaries you must go into it with an open mind and take the film for what it is. It isn't a fancy, modern, stylized, glamorized film about drugs but rather an honest, raw, bold and touching movie about the self-destruction of a boy who falls head first into the harrowing world of drug addiction. This movie for me is an overlooked, underrated piece of art. Which is why I love it. I wouldn't change one thing about it.

    Very loosely based on the memoir of the same name, The Basketball Diaries transposes the late '60s adolescence of writer and artist Jim Carroll to some unspecified time period at least 15 years later, further confusing the time frame with three decades of rock music, some by Carroll himself.The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Lorraine Bracco, James Madio, and Mark Wahlberg.It was directed by Scott Kalvert. Jim and his Catholic school chums are on the hottest basketball team in New York, but their friend Bobby languishes in the hospital with leukemia. In-between typically boyish adventures, Jim scribbles in his notebook and experiments with sex and drugs. His group of friends begins to disintegrate after coach Swifty not only makes a pass at Jim, but also catches him and his pals using drugs on the court and kicks them off the team. Out of school and on the streets, Jim turns tricks, betrays friends, robs stores, and deals drugs to feed his heroin addiction. Not even the efforts of former addict Reggie can cure Jim.Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He cannot go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim "picked up a game" now and then, is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity, which ultimately ends with Jim's incarceration in a state penitentiary. After months in the hospital, he gets out and later does a talk show about his drug life, but before that he turned down free drugs given to him by his old friend, Pedro.Jim started out as a practice basketball player, and moved on to writing his memoirs. Although it masquerades as a cautionary tale about the horrors of heroin, this epic of teen-age angst is more accurately seen as a reverential wallow in the gutter of self-absorption.One thing about the plot is that the view never understand what really motivated this intelligent adolescent, a gifted basketball player and sensitive writer, to descend into the hellish life of a drug addict and hustler on the mean streets of New York.It only showed how drugs can destroy one's life.As for the movie,it was a must-see as you get a glimpse of the great actor Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be.

    There was a huge uproar regarding this movie because of a scene where the main character walks into his classroom and starts gunning everybody down with a shotgun. As is typical everybody has missed the whole point of the movie. It is not designed to encourage school shootings, but to show people what heroin is really like. When it comes to violence on television and video games then I will repeat what was said to me once, not that anybody will listen - people are so stubborn that once that have a mindset, no amount of reason will change their mind. Anyway, before television there was an awful lot of violence - the Napoleonic Wars, the thirty years war, the crusades, and even World War I: probably one of the most violent of wars. Even then before literature or even the written language, Cain killed Abel, and he did not do it because a video game made him think that it was a good idea. Violence is apart of our nature and we do it because we are frustrated with the world and the way people react to us. It is basic to our nature, and I am not saying that it is alright, but rather stopping violence in the media is not going to change anything. The Basketball Diaries is about a heroin addict. We follow his life from when he becomes one to when he finally gives up. Even though he does not start off as a heroin addict, he is still taking drugs, or rather sniffing glue. He, Jim Carol, hangs with three other friends and they simply act like teenagers with a lot of energy. Jim is also a champion basketball player. There is a darker side to his life and that is that his best friend is dying of Leukemia. He does not want to believe it, but it is reality and once he dies things slowly begin to change. We are not sure what really happens, but I guess it has something to do with the realisation that they are no longer immortal. But that is not the main reason, it more has to do with the pain and the loss that he suffers after his friend dies, and it is not something that they could have fought against - in fact he was powerless to do anything about it. The realisation of ones weakness is a true humbliser. Starting the addiction is not focused that heavily on in the movie, but his first trip is, and it shows him running through a field of flowers. It is more that he describes how all of his pain has gone away - both the emotional and the physical. This is the thing about Heroin - it is one of the world's best painkillers, but it is also an incredibly addictive drug. What we see is how his life collapses around him as he becomes addicted to Heroin. He is kicked out of school, slowly looses his friends as they are each arrested for various crimes, and finally he himself is taken away as he lies in a pathetic heap before the door to his mothers' apartment. Near the end we even see him resort of Homosexuality, something that horrifies him, especially when he is molested by the basketball coach, to get money for drugs. This is further undermined when the drugs he purchases are fake. The Basketball Diaries is an incredible movie and shows something that we wish to ignore. The school shooting scene is not all that bad, and more shows his frustration with life and the way the drugs take away this frustration - but at a cost. It is something that has been taken right out of proportion and as such people take the wrong idea about the film.

    Jim Carroll's The Basketball Diaries tells in tattered detail how the author went in a few short months from being a Catholic high school basketball star to being a strung-out heroin addict who turned tricks for drugs. Like many such stories, it hangs fondly over the shock and repulsion, and ends with unbecoming quickness after contentment is recovered. Will there ever be a venue for a film about a character who skips through his drug period because he's so excited to show us what he did after he pulled his socks up? Not likely. If there's anything more tiresome than a scandalous parable with a lesson at the end, it's the lesson minus the parable. And so this reverential flounder in the sewer of narcissism shows us profusely that if you become addicted to drugs, you're prone to discover yourself living distraughtly on the streets, selling a body that looks increasingly less like a worthwhile purchase. Carroll was a kid who notwithstanding his misery attempted to develop his experience into prose. The snag with Scott Kalvert's film is that he's apt to translate the experiences too literally: Jim is so urgently pale and miserable that the idealism feels vain. He plays basketball at night in the rain after his best friend dies of leukemia, and it just looks wholly contrived, fake and banal, not poignant. As the film begins, Jim is on the basketball team at a Catholic high school in New York, where a depraved priest drools while spanking disobedient students with a full-size paddle and the class cringes rhythmically. This scene's more indebted to Victorian pornography than to any real private school in 20th century America. Jim and his friends are not upright Catholic boys. They steal from the lockers of the opposing basketball team, and the preferred off-court activity is experimenting with inhalants and pills. Swifty, the coach played by Bruno Kirby, makes implausible passes at Jim. And Jim's mother, played by a sadly wasted Lorraine Bracco, is a crudely flat character who functions here exclusively to implement tough love by kicking him out. Life for Jim is a descending coil of pills, cough medicine, booze, diving off cliffs into the Harlem River, fainting during a game and masturbating on the roof. There are also stirring gleans into the underbelly of users, pushers, hookers and pimps, as Jim floats at large from his comfort zones, while recording all in his diary. Jim's writing predictably operates as a narration. Like most poetry written by teenagers, it's childish idealism, agonizingly earnest, seeing life as sad because the writer's not happy. Soon though, he samples heroin, and "any ache, pain, sadness or guilt was completely flushed out." Remarkable, how real life unravels exactly like the movies. The movie hinges on three hard-wearing formulas: Jim facilitates his dying friend's temporary escape from the hospital so he can push his wheelchair down 42nd Street, Jim sees his ex-teammate on TV playing in an all-star game while Jim is in a squalid bar and, of course, Jim is rescued by a dignified black man, who finds him out cold, brings him home and puts him through cold turkey. In accounts like this, you can continuously rely on a laudable black ex-hoodlum, combing the streets for distressed white kids, functioning for white tolerance soap-boxing purposes as hidden supplies of authenticity and honor. DiCaprio does what he can with the role. Ernie Hudson is solid as the ex-junkie, and there is genuine feeling in Bracco's underwritten mother. But it's Juliette Lewis, as a greasy hooker, who once again taps an utterly real edge. But the movie is not credible. By the end, Jim is seen going in through a stage door, and then we hear him telling the story of his decline and recuperation. We can't determine if this is intended to be actual acknowledgment or a show: That's the whole movie's trouble. While the film has a preachy earnestness more like older films that take drug issues in hand, its mercilessly murky concentration on the despair of drug abuse makes for effective, gripping viewing, if only for purely morbid interest. The teen years, an age of revolt and insecurity in the best of conditions, can be shocking when an individual gets that carried away. This stark, muddled film depicts this, with reductive prurience indeed, but also with brutalizing efficacy.

    Basketball Diaries, The (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Powerful adaptation of Jim Carroll's autobiographical account of his free fall from good student to heroin addict isn't a pretty film to watch but there's no denying its power. Leonard DiCaprio, in his first starring role, plays Carroll who when we first meet him is playing sports and is still in school but soon his minor drug habits start to spin out of control and he finds himself hooked, living on the streets and any hope for the future is nearly gone. I remember going to see THE BASKETBALL DIARIES a week after my fifteenth birthday and still remember what effect it had on me. I really didn't understand all the negative reviews the movie got at the time of its release but I found the film to be remarkably powerful and the message against drug abuse is still very strong in today's time. What all people then agreed on is that star DiCaprio seemed like he could do anything in the world. Coming after supporting roles in films like THIS BOYS LIFE and WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, this was certainly a departure from those two films but it was a real eye-opener because there's some of the most raw and powerful acting that you're ever going to see. The final thirty-minutes of the film pretty much has DiCaprio playing a drugged out character who is just inches away from death and the brutality of the performance is something one isn't going to forget. This is hands down a performance that once you see it it's unlikely to leave your mind and DiCaprio really gives it his all and it's really hard to think of another actor out there who could have given so much to the part. The way DiCaprio just crumbles under the drug abuse is so chilling and haunting that you really do feel as if you're watching a real addict and not just an actor playing a part. The support cast are also quite good with Ernie Hudson coming off extremely strong as a man trying to save the kid and Lorraine Bracco as his mother. Mark Wahlberg, Bruno Kirby and Juliette Lewis are also strong in their roles. I think there are a few issues with the film including too much attempted style by the director and this is really apparent during a sequence where DiCaprio is suffering from withdrawals. The acting is strong enough so the stylistic touches by the director are more distracting than anything else. The screenplay has taken some heat from people but I thought it was pretty good and captured the free-spirit of the novel, which it's based on. THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is as relevant today as it was when first released and it's certainly a terrific showcase for its star who has gone on to prove all those early critics right when they called him one of the greatest actors coming up. The film is a haunting reminder of the downsides of drugs and the rawness of the performances make it hard to watch at times but there's no denying its power.

    I thought "The Basketball Diaries" was a really good book, but this particular screen translation was bungled. Though a diary, the book is surprisingly well-written considering the author wrote it in his early teens, and it provides a great deal of insight into the world of Irish-Catholic youth in New York City during the 1960's. It's all real, but it reads like a good novel (I honestly liked it a lot more than "The Catcher in the Rye," and even "Junkie" by William S. Burroughs).

No insight is provided into heroin addiction at all; it's simply more Reagan-era "Just say no" religious crap. The ending in the book is also much bleaker than the ending in the film, which actually ends about 2/3rds of the way through the book, if I remember correctly. I do think the actors in the film were all terrific, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives a surprisingly mature performance. Ernie Hudson was also great, and the photography was gorgeous. But the movie itself just sucks. Read the book instead.

    Ever since hearing the commentary track of Paul Thomas Anderson for the Boogie Nights DVD (I heard it like in early 2008), this title, Scott Kalvert's The Basketball Diaries, came to stay in my mind. I really love the way P.T. Anderson, like Tarantino or now Edgar Wright, talks about his influences, about film in general, and in this case after hearing that he cast Mark Walhberg after seeing his performance in The Basketball Diaries ("god, he was good, god, I though he was so good" Â– and Mark made sure P.T. Anderson wanted him for his acting and not for his body!) definitely made me want to check it out (I Am Cuba is another of the titles that stayed with me thanks to that commentary. I still have to watch it tough). And P.T. Anderson explains that actually his first choice for that part was Leonardo DiCaprio. He doesn't specify, but it's very probable that DiCaprio became his choice also due to The Basketball Diaries (however he decided to do Titanic instead). Anyway, there is not a R4 DVD around that I know, so it was until some weeks ago, when I found on ebay a really cheap R1 DVD of it, when I sort of recall everything and finally got it. When you see a movie with the title of "The Basketball Diaries" and a very young DiCaprio, I mean, a young blonde kid in school clothes in its DVD cover you may not think of it as something really interesting. Definitely you don't think of it as a strong movie about the consequences of drug addiction. This is a movie that deals with the downfall of some very talented young basketball players. It has few to offer for those seeking for a straight sports movie though. We learn that our characters really can play basketball, and pretty much that's it. This is really a straight drug movie. And it's a really good one even though it doesn't really add something "brand-new" to the drug movie sort of formula (but we probably have here the basketball game with the most doped players. That scene features the Doors' "Riders on the Storm", which is pretty cool indeed). My sort of analogy goes with the thing that DiCaprio became like a different actor once he began working with Martin Scorsese back in 2002. He definitely left Titanic behind. Maybe before Scorsese but hell, since Gangs of New York I, at least, see a different DiCaprio. So here in The Basketball Diaries we have like the two DiCaprio. The movie at first sight is a coming of age one with the Titanic DiCaprio suffering the type of education that his Catholic school gives but also having fun with his friends (all are part of a great Catholic basketball team that is pretty much invincible) and stuff; it's a "kids being kids" kind of story. Once the movie gets much darker we get to see the Scorsese DiCaprio. Somehow some scenes really make see the very intense DiCaprio from the Scorsese films. It was a surprise to have him here doing something like that, two years before Titanic (I have yet to see What's Eating Gilbert Grape, for which he earned his first Oscar nomination back in 1994). This is worth watching stuff.

    Based on the autobiographical novel written by Jim Carroll, The Basketball Diaries follows one young man's descent into addiction, crime and homelessness. Jim (here played with mature dedication by Leonardo Di Caprio) is a promising high school basketball player, who along with his three friends, enjoy shooting hoops and getting into general mischief. What starts out as a past-time, soon deteriorates into something more deprived and desperate, as Jim sees his world crash around him as his drug habit becomes an unstoppable affliction. When Jim's situation gets so desperate that he leaves home to hustle and rob on the streets, he begins to push away the people in his life that were once close to him. His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, throws him out after the extremities of his situation become apparent to her and refuses him back. Reggie (Ernie Hudson) was an inspirational figure and mentor to Jim and regularly met up to play basketball in the court. And Neutron (Patrick McGaw) distances himself from Jim and his friends' habits and focuses on his basketball career, much to Jim's dismay. These people will all have a profound effect on Jim's eventual redemption. The film also switches the book's real-life setting from 1960's New York to the 90's. What The Basketball Diaries attempts to do is to create a realistic and gritty (a phrase that seems to be thrown around a lot these days) depiction of drug abuse, and create a hellish portrait of a confused young man who his throwing away his many talents in favour of a life that is doing nothing but ruining his life and isolating the people around him. In reality, this is a terribly-directed film that seems to sledgehammer the phrase 'drugs are bad' into the viewers skull, rather than having the nerve, or in deed the respect, to let the audience make their own mind up. Or maybe the director doesn't have the skill to create a film capable of conjuring up those feelings in the viewer. It sounds ridiculous, but if you have seen the South Park episode where Mr Mackey is giving his anti-drug lecture by simply listing the drugs that are 'bad', then you can see a clear parallel to this film. Jim basically goes from one drug to the other and one crime to the next. It's not interesting, convincing, and to be honest I found it all just very annoying. Jim is a character of no redeeming qualities. He's selfish, careless, and is basically a whiny little kid. Fair enough, this is a chance to develop an interesting, fully-rounded character, but director Scott Kalvert and scriptwriter Bryan Goluboff cannot combine their 'skills' to pull it off. Even though Jim narrates the film and reveals everything about his feelings and opinions, and Di Caprio's fantastic performance, we never get inside Jim's head enough to understand him and why he is willing to give up on a fledging basketball career. This is a character that we're supposed to be praying for to overcome his addiction, but (spoilers!) when his clean-break arrived, I asked myself should I be feeling happy for this arsehole? A well-acted film all-round, namely from the lead and Mark Wahlberg as his friend Mickey, but a film that is swamped in faults and scenes that are just ridiculous. Possibly only remotely remembered for the controversial scene where Jim storms his school with a shotgun in a drug-addled fantasy, which was caught up in the media storm surrounding the Columbine High School massacre. Watch only for signs of early promise from Di Caprio, but otherwise avoid. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    The Basketball Diaries is the movie that showed exactly how much acting potential Leonardo DiCaprio has. The good. Gripping sad story. Extreme realism and superb acting, you really get into their shoes, very immersive. You get to understand their story, their situation. Tight well executed scenes. Nice camera work. Solid score. The actors. Not only does Leonardo DiCaprio shine like a true star, but Mark Wahlberg also shows his talent. The rest of the cast is almost as impeccable. The bad. The end scene on the stage is badly staged. No pun intended. It's a bit awkward, but it's easily forgivable. The ugly. It pictures drugs as a social disease whereas their use is actually a symptom of an underlying problem. But then, everybody thinks that, because that's the official story. The result. It's a forbidding tale, but everyone should watch it and understand.

    This film isn't for everyone, you either hate it or love it. It sometimes lacks that constant up-beat easy to watch feel that certain types of audiences need to enjoy a film and is replaced with brutal honesty.The performances from all of the actors were outstanding, with Leonardo DiCaprio performing some of the best acting I have ever seen. His portrayal of Jim was so real and raw that he gave so much of himself to the role that it began to look effortless. So many scenes in this movie were beautifully done. A few stand out moments to name: The basketball scene in the rain, every confrontation between Jim and his mother, and the Withdrawal scene where once again Leo gives a spine tingling performance. If you want to enjoy The Basketball diaries you must go into it with an open mind and take the film for what it is. It isn't a fancy, modern, stylized, glamorized film about drugs but rather an honest, raw, bold and touching movie about the self-destruction of a boy who falls head first into the harrowing world of drug addiction. This movie for me is an overlooked, underrated piece of art. Which is why I love it. I wouldn't change one thing about it.

    Very loosely based on the memoir of the same name, The Basketball Diaries transposes the late '60s adolescence of writer and artist Jim Carroll to some unspecified time period at least 15 years later, further confusing the time frame with three decades of rock music, some by Carroll himself.The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Lorraine Bracco, James Madio, and Mark Wahlberg.It was directed by Scott Kalvert. Jim and his Catholic school chums are on the hottest basketball team in New York, but their friend Bobby languishes in the hospital with leukemia. In-between typically boyish adventures, Jim scribbles in his notebook and experiments with sex and drugs. His group of friends begins to disintegrate after coach Swifty not only makes a pass at Jim, but also catches him and his pals using drugs on the court and kicks them off the team. Out of school and on the streets, Jim turns tricks, betrays friends, robs stores, and deals drugs to feed his heroin addiction. Not even the efforts of former addict Reggie can cure Jim.Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He cannot go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim "picked up a game" now and then, is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity, which ultimately ends with Jim's incarceration in a state penitentiary. After months in the hospital, he gets out and later does a talk show about his drug life, but before that he turned down free drugs given to him by his old friend, Pedro.Jim started out as a practice basketball player, and moved on to writing his memoirs. Although it masquerades as a cautionary tale about the horrors of heroin, this epic of teen-age angst is more accurately seen as a reverential wallow in the gutter of self-absorption.One thing about the plot is that the view never understand what really motivated this intelligent adolescent, a gifted basketball player and sensitive writer, to descend into the hellish life of a drug addict and hustler on the mean streets of New York.It only showed how drugs can destroy one's life.As for the movie,it was a must-see as you get a glimpse of the great actor Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be.

    There was a huge uproar regarding this movie because of a scene where the main character walks into his classroom and starts gunning everybody down with a shotgun. As is typical everybody has missed the whole point of the movie. It is not designed to encourage school shootings, but to show people what heroin is really like. When it comes to violence on television and video games then I will repeat what was said to me once, not that anybody will listen - people are so stubborn that once that have a mindset, no amount of reason will change their mind. Anyway, before television there was an awful lot of violence - the Napoleonic Wars, the thirty years war, the crusades, and even World War I: probably one of the most violent of wars. Even then before literature or even the written language, Cain killed Abel, and he did not do it because a video game made him think that it was a good idea. Violence is apart of our nature and we do it because we are frustrated with the world and the way people react to us. It is basic to our nature, and I am not saying that it is alright, but rather stopping violence in the media is not going to change anything. The Basketball Diaries is about a heroin addict. We follow his life from when he becomes one to when he finally gives up. Even though he does not start off as a heroin addict, he is still taking drugs, or rather sniffing glue. He, Jim Carol, hangs with three other friends and they simply act like teenagers with a lot of energy. Jim is also a champion basketball player. There is a darker side to his life and that is that his best friend is dying of Leukemia. He does not want to believe it, but it is reality and once he dies things slowly begin to change. We are not sure what really happens, but I guess it has something to do with the realisation that they are no longer immortal. But that is not the main reason, it more has to do with the pain and the loss that he suffers after his friend dies, and it is not something that they could have fought against - in fact he was powerless to do anything about it. The realisation of ones weakness is a true humbliser. Starting the addiction is not focused that heavily on in the movie, but his first trip is, and it shows him running through a field of flowers. It is more that he describes how all of his pain has gone away - both the emotional and the physical. This is the thing about Heroin - it is one of the world's best painkillers, but it is also an incredibly addictive drug. What we see is how his life collapses around him as he becomes addicted to Heroin. He is kicked out of school, slowly looses his friends as they are each arrested for various crimes, and finally he himself is taken away as he lies in a pathetic heap before the door to his mothers' apartment. Near the end we even see him resort of Homosexuality, something that horrifies him, especially when he is molested by the basketball coach, to get money for drugs. This is further undermined when the drugs he purchases are fake. The Basketball Diaries is an incredible movie and shows something that we wish to ignore. The school shooting scene is not all that bad, and more shows his frustration with life and the way the drugs take away this frustration - but at a cost. It is something that has been taken right out of proportion and as such people take the wrong idea about the film.

    Jim Carroll's The Basketball Diaries tells in tattered detail how the author went in a few short months from being a Catholic high school basketball star to being a strung-out heroin addict who turned tricks for drugs. Like many such stories, it hangs fondly over the shock and repulsion, and ends with unbecoming quickness after contentment is recovered. Will there ever be a venue for a film about a character who skips through his drug period because he's so excited to show us what he did after he pulled his socks up? Not likely. If there's anything more tiresome than a scandalous parable with a lesson at the end, it's the lesson minus the parable. And so this reverential flounder in the sewer of narcissism shows us profusely that if you become addicted to drugs, you're prone to discover yourself living distraughtly on the streets, selling a body that looks increasingly less like a worthwhile purchase. Carroll was a kid who notwithstanding his misery attempted to develop his experience into prose. The snag with Scott Kalvert's film is that he's apt to translate the experiences too literally: Jim is so urgently pale and miserable that the idealism feels vain. He plays basketball at night in the rain after his best friend dies of leukemia, and it just looks wholly contrived, fake and banal, not poignant. As the film begins, Jim is on the basketball team at a Catholic high school in New York, where a depraved priest drools while spanking disobedient students with a full-size paddle and the class cringes rhythmically. This scene's more indebted to Victorian pornography than to any real private school in 20th century America. Jim and his friends are not upright Catholic boys. They steal from the lockers of the opposing basketball team, and the preferred off-court activity is experimenting with inhalants and pills. Swifty, the coach played by Bruno Kirby, makes implausible passes at Jim. And Jim's mother, played by a sadly wasted Lorraine Bracco, is a crudely flat character who functions here exclusively to implement tough love by kicking him out. Life for Jim is a descending coil of pills, cough medicine, booze, diving off cliffs into the Harlem River, fainting during a game and masturbating on the roof. There are also stirring gleans into the underbelly of users, pushers, hookers and pimps, as Jim floats at large from his comfort zones, while recording all in his diary. Jim's writing predictably operates as a narration. Like most poetry written by teenagers, it's childish idealism, agonizingly earnest, seeing life as sad because the writer's not happy. Soon though, he samples heroin, and "any ache, pain, sadness or guilt was completely flushed out." Remarkable, how real life unravels exactly like the movies. The movie hinges on three hard-wearing formulas: Jim facilitates his dying friend's temporary escape from the hospital so he can push his wheelchair down 42nd Street, Jim sees his ex-teammate on TV playing in an all-star game while Jim is in a squalid bar and, of course, Jim is rescued by a dignified black man, who finds him out cold, brings him home and puts him through cold turkey. In accounts like this, you can continuously rely on a laudable black ex-hoodlum, combing the streets for distressed white kids, functioning for white tolerance soap-boxing purposes as hidden supplies of authenticity and honor. DiCaprio does what he can with the role. Ernie Hudson is solid as the ex-junkie, and there is genuine feeling in Bracco's underwritten mother. But it's Juliette Lewis, as a greasy hooker, who once again taps an utterly real edge. But the movie is not credible. By the end, Jim is seen going in through a stage door, and then we hear him telling the story of his decline and recuperation. We can't determine if this is intended to be actual acknowledgment or a show: That's the whole movie's trouble. While the film has a preachy earnestness more like older films that take drug issues in hand, its mercilessly murky concentration on the despair of drug abuse makes for effective, gripping viewing, if only for purely morbid interest. The teen years, an age of revolt and insecurity in the best of conditions, can be shocking when an individual gets that carried away. This stark, muddled film depicts this, with reductive prurience indeed, but also with brutalizing efficacy.

    Basketball Diaries, The (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Powerful adaptation of Jim Carroll's autobiographical account of his free fall from good student to heroin addict isn't a pretty film to watch but there's no denying its power. Leonard DiCaprio, in his first starring role, plays Carroll who when we first meet him is playing sports and is still in school but soon his minor drug habits start to spin out of control and he finds himself hooked, living on the streets and any hope for the future is nearly gone. I remember going to see THE BASKETBALL DIARIES a week after my fifteenth birthday and still remember what effect it had on me. I really didn't understand all the negative reviews the movie got at the time of its release but I found the film to be remarkably powerful and the message against drug abuse is still very strong in today's time. What all people then agreed on is that star DiCaprio seemed like he could do anything in the world. Coming after supporting roles in films like THIS BOYS LIFE and WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, this was certainly a departure from those two films but it was a real eye-opener because there's some of the most raw and powerful acting that you're ever going to see. The final thirty-minutes of the film pretty much has DiCaprio playing a drugged out character who is just inches away from death and the brutality of the performance is something one isn't going to forget. This is hands down a performance that once you see it it's unlikely to leave your mind and DiCaprio really gives it his all and it's really hard to think of another actor out there who could have given so much to the part. The way DiCaprio just crumbles under the drug abuse is so chilling and haunting that you really do feel as if you're watching a real addict and not just an actor playing a part. The support cast are also quite good with Ernie Hudson coming off extremely strong as a man trying to save the kid and Lorraine Bracco as his mother. Mark Wahlberg, Bruno Kirby and Juliette Lewis are also strong in their roles. I think there are a few issues with the film including too much attempted style by the director and this is really apparent during a sequence where DiCaprio is suffering from withdrawals. The acting is strong enough so the stylistic touches by the director are more distracting than anything else. The screenplay has taken some heat from people but I thought it was pretty good and captured the free-spirit of the novel, which it's based on. THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is as relevant today as it was when first released and it's certainly a terrific showcase for its star who has gone on to prove all those early critics right when they called him one of the greatest actors coming up. The film is a haunting reminder of the downsides of drugs and the rawness of the performances make it hard to watch at times but there's no denying its power.

    I watched this film recently with my girlfriend and several friends having not seen it since around the time when it first came out. I remember at the time thinking how powerful a performance Leonardo Dicaprio gave of Jim Carrol's real life character. The performance was so good I remember at the time telling friends who had recently seen Titanic, that they will be shocked by this performance as it proved he is one of the most versatile actors in cinema today and then. Over the years I have told people I have met, you need to see this movie but not many have and it seems to have sneaked under the radar a little. Therefore when It was on television recently I made everyone watch this film. Everyone who did came back to me saying the same thing, 'wasn't leo good in it'!! The scenes involving Carrol begging his mother to let him into the apartment so he can ask for money to help feed his drug habit are shockingly powerful. Its an amazing portrayal of the dangers of drug addiction and how it can effect young people who dabble with the dangers so quickly, turning their lives on its head with out them realising how it even happened. some strong messages in this film that many teenagers need to watch. Having watched it again some years later, It has dated slightly in time but not only Leo is outstanding but Mark Whalberg shows that he too was showing potential back then 15 years ago or so. I have never been too sure of Whalberg in the past sometimes mixing natural acting ability in movies such as 'the fighter' or his interesting performance of the character police detective 'dignam' in the departed with shocking performances such as 'the happening or Planet of the Apes (where to be honest I don't blame him but the directors for poor casting). But Wharlberg in this movie shows genuine class, perhaps portraying a young man who had an adolecence pretty similar to his diaries character 'mickey'. on a whole the film is a class act and hidden gem. A must see.

    I thought "The Basketball Diaries" was a really good book, but this particular screen translation was bungled. Though a diary, the book is surprisingly well-written considering the author wrote it in his early teens, and it provides a great deal of insight into the world of Irish-Catholic youth in New York City during the 1960's. It's all real, but it reads like a good novel (I honestly liked it a lot more than "The Catcher in the Rye," and even "Junkie" by William S. Burroughs). It is also incredibly graphic, particularly in how it deals with Carroll prostituting himself to support his heroin addiction. I can't think of a single novel written by an adult about teenage life that has balls like that. The problem with the movie is that it totally misses the point of the book. Since Carroll is writing about himself, the book is completely non-judgemental. It simply documents the events. The movie, on the other hand, is like the after-school special version of the book. DiCaprio's character tries heroin, and in the very next scene, he's a filthy bum living in an alleyway. No insight is provided into heroin addiction at all; it's simply more Reagan-era "Just say no" religious crap. The ending in the book is also much bleaker than the ending in the film, which actually ends about 2/3rds of the way through the book, if I remember correctly. I do think the actors in the film were all terrific, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives a surprisingly mature performance. Ernie Hudson was also great, and the photography was gorgeous. But the movie itself just sucks. Read the book instead.

    Based on the autobiographical novel written by Jim Carroll, The Basketball Diaries follows one young man's descent into addiction, crime and homelessness. Jim (here played with mature dedication by Leonardo Di Caprio) is a promising high school basketball player, who along with his three friends, enjoy shooting hoops and getting into general mischief. What starts out as a past-time, soon deteriorates into something more deprived and desperate, as Jim sees his world crash around him as his drug habit becomes an unstoppable affliction. When Jim's situation gets so desperate that he leaves home to hustle and rob on the streets, he begins to push away the people in his life that were once close to him. His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, throws him out after the extremities of his situation become apparent to her and refuses him back. Reggie (Ernie Hudson) was an inspirational figure and mentor to Jim and regularly met up to play basketball in the court. And Neutron (Patrick McGaw) distances himself from Jim and his friends' habits and focuses on his basketball career, much to Jim's dismay. These people will all have a profound effect on Jim's eventual redemption. The film also switches the book's real-life setting from 1960's New York to the 90's. What The Basketball Diaries attempts to do is to create a realistic and gritty (a phrase that seems to be thrown around a lot these days) depiction of drug abuse, and create a hellish portrait of a confused young man who his throwing away his many talents in favour of a life that is doing nothing but ruining his life and isolating the people around him. In reality, this is a terribly-directed film that seems to sledgehammer the phrase 'drugs are bad' into the viewers skull, rather than having the nerve, or in deed the respect, to let the audience make their own mind up.

It sounds ridiculous, but if you have seen the South Park episode where Mr Mackey is giving his anti-drug lecture by simply listing the drugs that are 'bad', then you can see a clear parallel to this film. Jim basically goes from one drug to the other and one crime to the next. It's not interesting, convincing, and to be honest I found it all just very annoying. Jim is a character of no redeeming qualities. He's selfish, careless, and is basically a whiny little kid. Fair enough, this is a chance to develop an interesting, fully-rounded character, but director Scott Kalvert and scriptwriter Bryan Goluboff cannot combine their 'skills' to pull it off. Even though Jim narrates the film and reveals everything about his feelings and opinions, and Di Caprio's fantastic performance, we never get inside Jim's head enough to understand him and why he is willing to give up on a fledging basketball career. This is a character that we're supposed to be praying for to overcome his addiction, but (spoilers!) when his clean-break arrived, I asked myself should I be feeling happy for this arsehole? A well-acted film all-round, namely from the lead and Mark Wahlberg as his friend Mickey, but a film that is swamped in faults and scenes that are just ridiculous. Possibly only remotely remembered for the controversial scene where Jim storms his school with a shotgun in a drug-addled fantasy, which was caught up in the media storm surrounding the Columbine High School massacre. Watch only for signs of early promise from Di Caprio, but otherwise avoid. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    The Basketball Diaries is the movie that showed exactly how much acting potential Leonardo DiCaprio has. The good. Gripping sad story. Extreme realism and superb acting, you really get into their shoes, very immersive. You get to understand their story, their situation. Tight well executed scenes. Nice camera work. Solid score. The actors. Not only does Leonardo DiCaprio shine like a true star, but Mark Wahlberg also shows his talent. The rest of the cast is almost as impeccable. The bad. The end scene on the stage is badly staged. No pun intended. It's a bit awkward, but it's easily forgivable. The ugly. It pictures drugs as a social disease whereas their use is actually a symptom of an underlying problem. But then, everybody thinks that, because that's the official story. The result. It's a forbidding tale, but everyone should watch it and understand.

    This film isn't for everyone, you either hate it or love it. It sometimes lacks that constant up-beat easy to watch feel that certain types of audiences need to enjoy a film and is replaced with brutal honesty.The performances from all of the actors were outstanding, with Leonardo DiCaprio performing some of the best acting I have ever seen. His portrayal of Jim was so real and raw that he gave so much of himself to the role that it began to look effortless. So many scenes in this movie were beautifully done. A few stand out moments to name: The basketball scene in the rain, every confrontation between Jim and his mother, and the Withdrawal scene where once again Leo gives a spine tingling performance. If you want to enjoy The Basketball diaries you must go into it with an open mind and take the film for what it is. It isn't a fancy, modern, stylized, glamorized film about drugs but rather an honest, raw, bold and touching movie about the self-destruction of a boy who falls head first into the harrowing world of drug addiction. This movie for me is an overlooked, underrated piece of art. Which is why I love it. I wouldn't change one thing about it.

    Very loosely based on the memoir of the same name, The Basketball Diaries transposes the late '60s adolescence of writer and artist Jim Carroll to some unspecified time period at least 15 years later, further confusing the time frame with three decades of rock music, some by Carroll himself.The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Lorraine Bracco, James Madio, and Mark Wahlberg.It was directed by Scott Kalvert. Jim and his Catholic school chums are on the hottest basketball team in New York, but their friend Bobby languishes in the hospital with leukemia. In-between typically boyish adventures, Jim scribbles in his notebook and experiments with sex and drugs. His group of friends begins to disintegrate after coach Swifty not only makes a pass at Jim, but also catches him and his pals using drugs on the court and kicks them off the team. Out of school and on the streets, Jim turns tricks, betrays friends, robs stores, and deals drugs to feed his heroin addiction. Not even the efforts of former addict Reggie can cure Jim.Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He cannot go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim "picked up a game" now and then, is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity, which ultimately ends with Jim's incarceration in a state penitentiary. After months in the hospital, he gets out and later does a talk show about his drug life, but before that he turned down free drugs given to him by his old friend, Pedro.Jim started out as a practice basketball player, and moved on to writing his memoirs. Although it masquerades as a cautionary tale about the horrors of heroin, this epic of teen-age angst is more accurately seen as a reverential wallow in the gutter of self-absorption.One thing about the plot is that the view never understand what really motivated this intelligent adolescent, a gifted basketball player and sensitive writer, to descend into the hellish life of a drug addict and hustler on the mean streets of New York.It only showed how drugs can destroy one's life.As for the movie,it was a must-see as you get a glimpse of the great actor Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be.

    There was a huge uproar regarding this movie because of a scene where the main character walks into his classroom and starts gunning everybody down with a shotgun. As is typical everybody has missed the whole point of the movie. It is not designed to encourage school shootings, but to show people what heroin is really like. When it comes to violence on television and video games then I will repeat what was said to me once, not that anybody will listen - people are so stubborn that once that have a mindset, no amount of reason will change their mind. Anyway, before television there was an awful lot of violence - the Napoleonic Wars, the thirty years war, the crusades, and even World War I: probably one of the most violent of wars. Even then before literature or even the written language, Cain killed Abel, and he did not do it because a video game made him think that it was a good idea. Violence is apart of our nature and we do it because we are frustrated with the world and the way people react to us. It is basic to our nature, and I am not saying that it is alright, but rather stopping violence in the media is not going to change anything. The Basketball Diaries is about a heroin addict. We follow his life from when he becomes one to when he finally gives up. Even though he does not start off as a heroin addict, he is still taking drugs, or rather sniffing glue. He, Jim Carol, hangs with three other friends and they simply act like teenagers with a lot of energy. Jim is also a champion basketball player. There is a darker side to his life and that is that his best friend is dying of Leukemia. He does not want to believe it, but it is reality and once he dies things slowly begin to change. We are not sure what really happens, but I guess it has something to do with the realisation that they are no longer immortal. But that is not the main reason, it more has to do with the pain and the loss that he suffers after his friend dies, and it is not something that they could have fought against - in fact he was powerless to do anything about it. The realisation of ones weakness is a true humbliser. Starting the addiction is not focused that heavily on in the movie, but his first trip is, and it shows him running through a field of flowers. It is more that he describes how all of his pain has gone away - both the emotional and the physical. This is the thing about Heroin - it is one of the world's best painkillers, but it is also an incredibly addictive drug. What we see is how his life collapses around him as he becomes addicted to Heroin. He is kicked out of school, slowly looses his friends as they are each arrested for various crimes, and finally he himself is taken away as he lies in a pathetic heap before the door to his mothers' apartment. Near the end we even see him resort of Homosexuality, something that horrifies him, especially when he is molested by the basketball coach, to get money for drugs. This is further undermined when the drugs he purchases are fake. The Basketball Diaries is an incredible movie and shows something that we wish to ignore. The school shooting scene is not all that bad, and more shows his frustration with life and the way the drugs take away this frustration - but at a cost. It is something that has been taken right out of proportion and as such people take the wrong idea about the film.

    Jim Carroll's The Basketball Diaries tells in tattered detail how the author went in a few short months from being a Catholic high school basketball star to being a strung-out heroin addict who turned tricks for drugs. Like many such stories, it hangs fondly over the shock and repulsion, and ends with unbecoming quickness after contentment is recovered. Will there ever be a venue for a film about a character who skips through his drug period because he's so excited to show us what he did after he pulled his socks up? Not likely. If there's anything more tiresome than a scandalous parable with a lesson at the end, it's the lesson minus the parable. And so this reverential flounder in the sewer of narcissism shows us profusely that if you become addicted to drugs, you're prone to discover yourself living distraughtly on the streets, selling a body that looks increasingly less like a worthwhile purchase. Carroll was a kid who notwithstanding his misery attempted to develop his experience into prose. The snag with Scott Kalvert's film is that he's apt to translate the experiences too literally: Jim is so urgently pale and miserable that the idealism feels vain. He plays basketball at night in the rain after his best friend dies of leukemia, and it just looks wholly contrived, fake and banal, not poignant. As the film begins, Jim is on the basketball team at a Catholic high school in New York, where a depraved priest drools while spanking disobedient students with a full-size paddle and the class cringes rhythmically. This scene's more indebted to Victorian pornography than to any real private school in 20th century America. Jim and his friends are not upright Catholic boys. They steal from the lockers of the opposing basketball team, and the preferred off-court activity is experimenting with inhalants and pills. Swifty, the coach played by Bruno Kirby, makes implausible passes at Jim. And Jim's mother, played by a sadly wasted Lorraine Bracco, is a crudely flat character who functions here exclusively to implement tough love by kicking him out. Life for Jim is a descending coil of pills, cough medicine, booze, diving off cliffs into the Harlem River, fainting during a game and masturbating on the roof. There are also stirring gleans into the underbelly of users, pushers, hookers and pimps, as Jim floats at large from his comfort zones, while recording all in his diary. Jim's writing predictably operates as a narration. Like most poetry written by teenagers, it's childish idealism, agonizingly earnest, seeing life as sad because the writer's not happy. Soon though, he samples heroin, and "any ache, pain, sadness or guilt was completely flushed out." Remarkable, how real life unravels exactly like the movies. The movie hinges on three hard-wearing formulas: Jim facilitates his dying friend's temporary escape from the hospital so he can push his wheelchair down 42nd Street, Jim sees his ex-teammate on TV playing in an all-star game while Jim is in a squalid bar and, of course, Jim is rescued by a dignified black man, who finds him out cold, brings him home and puts him through cold turkey. In accounts like this, you can continuously rely on a laudable black ex-hoodlum, combing the streets for distressed white kids, functioning for white tolerance soap-boxing purposes as hidden supplies of authenticity and honor. DiCaprio does what he can with the role. Ernie Hudson is solid as the ex-junkie, and there is genuine feeling in Bracco's underwritten mother. But it's Juliette Lewis, as a greasy hooker, who once again taps an utterly real edge. But the movie is not credible. By the end, Jim is seen going in through a stage door, and then we hear him telling the story of his decline and recuperation. We can't determine if this is intended to be actual acknowledgment or a show: That's the whole movie's trouble. While the film has a preachy earnestness more like older films that take drug issues in hand, its mercilessly murky concentration on the despair of drug abuse makes for effective, gripping viewing, if only for purely morbid interest. The teen years, an age of revolt and insecurity in the best of conditions, can be shocking when an individual gets that carried away. This stark, muddled film depicts this, with reductive prurience indeed, but also with brutalizing efficacy.

    Basketball Diaries, The (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Powerful adaptation of Jim Carroll's autobiographical account of his free fall from good student to heroin addict isn't a pretty film to watch but there's no denying its power. Leonard DiCaprio, in his first starring role, plays Carroll who when we first meet him is playing sports and is still in school but soon his minor drug habits start to spin out of control and he finds himself hooked, living on the streets and any hope for the future is nearly gone. I remember going to see THE BASKETBALL DIARIES a week after my fifteenth birthday and still remember what effect it had on me. I really didn't understand all the negative reviews the movie got at the time of its release but I found the film to be remarkably powerful and the message against drug abuse is still very strong in today's time. What all people then agreed on is that star DiCaprio seemed like he could do anything in the world. Coming after supporting roles in films like THIS BOYS LIFE and WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, this was certainly a departure from those two films but it was a real eye-opener because there's some of the most raw and powerful acting that you're ever going to see. The final thirty-minutes of the film pretty much has DiCaprio playing a drugged out character who is just inches away from death and the brutality of the performance is something one isn't going to forget. This is hands down a performance that once you see it it's unlikely to leave your mind and DiCaprio really gives it his all and it's really hard to think of another actor out there who could have given so much to the part. The way DiCaprio just crumbles under the drug abuse is so chilling and haunting that you really do feel as if you're watching a real addict and not just an actor playing a part. The support cast are also quite good with Ernie Hudson coming off extremely strong as a man trying to save the kid and Lorraine Bracco as his mother. Mark Wahlberg, Bruno Kirby and Juliette Lewis are also strong in their roles. I think there are a few issues with the film including too much attempted style by the director and this is really apparent during a sequence where DiCaprio is suffering from withdrawals. The acting is strong enough so the stylistic touches by the director are more distracting than anything else. The screenplay has taken some heat from people but I thought it was pretty good and captured the free-spirit of the novel, which it's based on. THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is as relevant today as it was when first released and it's certainly a terrific showcase for its star who has gone on to prove all those early critics right when they called him one of the greatest actors coming up. The film is a haunting reminder of the downsides of drugs and the rawness of the performances make it hard to watch at times but there's no denying its power.

    I watched this film recently with my girlfriend and several friends having not seen it since around the time when it first came out. I remember at the time thinking how powerful a performance Leonardo Dicaprio gave of Jim Carrol's real life character. The performance was so good I remember at the time telling friends who had recently seen Titanic, that they will be shocked by this performance as it proved he is one of the most versatile actors in cinema today and then. Over the years I have told people I have met, you need to see this movie but not many have and it seems to have sneaked under the radar a little. Therefore when It was on television recently I made everyone watch this film. Everyone who did came back to me saying the same thing, 'wasn't leo good in it'!! The scenes involving Carrol begging his mother to let him into the apartment so he can ask for money to help feed his drug habit are shockingly powerful. Its an amazing portrayal of the dangers of drug addiction and how it can effect young people who dabble with the dangers so quickly, turning their lives on its head with out them realising how it even happened. some strong messages in this film that many teenagers need to watch. Having watched it again some years later, It has dated slightly in time but not only Leo is outstanding but Mark Whalberg shows that he too was showing potential back then 15 years ago or so. I have never been too sure of Whalberg in the past sometimes mixing natural acting ability in movies such as 'the fighter' or his interesting performance of the character police detective 'dignam' in the departed with shocking performances such as 'the happening or Planet of the Apes (where to be honest I don't blame him but the directors for poor casting). But Wharlberg in this movie shows genuine class, perhaps portraying a young man who had an adolecence pretty similar to his diaries character 'mickey'. on a whole the film is a class act and hidden gem. A must see.

    I thought "The Basketball Diaries" was a really good book, but this particular screen translation was bungled. Though a diary, the book is surprisingly well-written considering the author wrote it in his early teens, and it provides a great deal of insight into the world of Irish-Catholic youth in New York City during the 1960's. It's all real, but it reads like a good novel (I honestly liked it a lot more than "The Catcher in the Rye," and even "Junkie" by William S. Burroughs). It is also incredibly graphic, particularly in how it deals with Carroll prostituting himself to support his heroin addiction. I can't think of a single novel written by an adult about teenage life that has balls like that. The problem with the movie is that it totally misses the point of the book. Since Carroll is writing about himself, the book is completely non-judgemental. It simply documents the events. The movie, on the other hand, is like the after-school special version of the book. DiCaprio's character tries heroin, and in the very next scene, he's a filthy bum living in an alleyway. No insight is provided into heroin addiction at all; it's simply more Reagan-era "Just say no" religious crap. The ending in the book is also much bleaker than the ending in the film, which actually ends about 2/3rds of the way through the book, if I remember correctly. I do think the actors in the film were all terrific, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives a surprisingly mature performance. Ernie Hudson was also great, and the photography was gorgeous. But the movie itself just sucks. Read the book instead.

    Ever since hearing the commentary track of Paul Thomas Anderson for the Boogie Nights DVD (I heard it like in early 2008), this title, Scott Kalvert's The Basketball Diaries, came to stay in my mind. I really love the way P.T. Anderson, like Tarantino or now Edgar Wright, talks about his influences, about film in general, and in this case after hearing that he cast Mark Walhberg after seeing his performance in The Basketball Diaries ("god, he was good, god, I though he was so good" Â– and Mark made sure P.T. Anderson wanted him for his acting and not for his body!) definitely made me want to check it out (I Am Cuba is another of the titles that stayed with me thanks to that commentary. I still have to watch it tough). And P.T. Anderson explains that actually his first choice for that part was Leonardo DiCaprio. He doesn't specify, but it's very probable that DiCaprio became his choice also due to The Basketball Diaries (however he decided to do Titanic instead). Anyway, there is not a R4 DVD around that I know, so it was until some weeks ago, when I found on ebay a really cheap R1 DVD of it, when I sort of recall everything and finally got it. When you see a movie with the title of "The Basketball Diaries" and a very young DiCaprio, I mean, a young blonde kid in school clothes in its DVD cover you may not think of it as something really interesting. Definitely you don't think of it as a strong movie about the consequences of drug addiction. This is a movie that deals with the downfall of some very talented young basketball players. It has few to offer for those seeking for a straight sports movie though. We learn that our characters really can play basketball, and pretty much that's it. This is really a straight drug movie. And it's a really good one even though it doesn't really add something "brand-new" to the drug movie sort of formula (but we probably have here the basketball game with the most doped players. That scene features the Doors' "Riders on the Storm", which is pretty cool indeed). My sort of analogy goes with the thing that DiCaprio became like a different actor once he began working with Martin Scorsese back in 2002. He definitely left Titanic behind. Maybe before Scorsese but hell, since Gangs of New York I, at least, see a different DiCaprio. So here in The Basketball Diaries we have like the two DiCaprio. The movie at first sight is a coming of age one with the Titanic DiCaprio suffering the type of education that his Catholic school gives but also having fun with his friends (all are part of a great Catholic basketball team that is pretty much invincible) and stuff; it's a "kids being kids" kind of story. Once the movie gets much darker we get to see the Scorsese DiCaprio. Somehow some scenes really make see the very intense DiCaprio from the Scorsese films. It was a surprise to have him here doing something like that, two years before Titanic (I have yet to see What's Eating Gilbert Grape, for which he earned his first Oscar nomination back in 1994). This is worth watching stuff.

    Based on the autobiographical novel written by Jim Carroll, The Basketball Diaries follows one young man's descent into addiction, crime and homelessness. Jim (here played with mature dedication by Leonardo Di Caprio) is a promising high school basketball player, who along with his three friends, enjoy shooting hoops and getting into general mischief. What starts out as a past-time, soon deteriorates into something more deprived and desperate, as Jim sees his world crash around him as his drug habit becomes an unstoppable affliction. When Jim's situation gets so desperate that he leaves home to hustle and rob on the streets, he begins to push away the people in his life that were once close to him. His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, throws him out after the extremities of his situation become apparent to her and refuses him back. Reggie (Ernie Hudson) was an inspirational figure and mentor to Jim and regularly met up to play basketball in the court. And Neutron (Patrick McGaw) distances himself from Jim and his friends' habits and focuses on his basketball career, much to Jim's dismay. These people will all have a profound effect on Jim's eventual redemption. The film also switches the book's real-life setting from 1960's New York to the 90's. What The Basketball Diaries attempts to do is to create a realistic and gritty (a phrase that seems to be thrown around a lot these days) depiction of drug abuse, and create a hellish portrait of a confused young man who his throwing away his many talents in favour of a life that is doing nothing but ruining his life and isolating the people around him. In reality, this is a terribly-directed film that seems to sledgehammer the phrase 'drugs are bad' into the viewers skull, rather than having the nerve, or in deed the respect, to let the audience make their own mind up. Or maybe the director doesn't have the skill to create a film capable of conjuring up those feelings in the viewer. It sounds ridiculous, but if you have seen the South Park episode where Mr Mackey is giving his anti-drug lecture by simply listing the drugs that are 'bad', then you can see a clear parallel to this film. Jim basically goes from one drug to the other and one crime to the next. It's not interesting, convincing, and to be honest I found it all just very annoying. Jim is a character of no redeeming qualities. He's selfish, careless, and is basically a whiny little kid. Fair enough, this is a chance to develop an interesting, fully-rounded character, but director Scott Kalvert and scriptwriter Bryan Goluboff cannot combine their 'skills' to pull it off. Even though Jim narrates the film and reveals everything about his feelings and opinions, and Di Caprio's fantastic performance, we never get inside Jim's head enough to understand him and why he is willing to give up on a fledging basketball career. This is a character that we're supposed to be praying for to overcome his addiction, but (spoilers!) when his clean-break arrived, I asked myself should I be feeling happy for this arsehole? A well-acted film all-round, namely from the lead and Mark Wahlberg as his friend Mickey, but a film that is swamped in faults and scenes that are just ridiculous. Possibly only remotely remembered for the controversial scene where Jim storms his school with a shotgun in a drug-addled fantasy, which was caught up in the media storm surrounding the Columbine High School massacre. Watch only for signs of early promise from Di Caprio, but otherwise avoid. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Very loosely based on the memoir of the same name, The Basketball Diaries transposes the late '60s adolescence of writer and artist Jim Carroll to some unspecified time period at least 15 years later, further confusing the time frame with three decades of rock music, some by Carroll himself.The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Lorraine Bracco, James Madio, and Mark Wahlberg.It was directed by Scott Kalvert. Jim and his Catholic school chums are on the hottest basketball team in New York, but their friend Bobby languishes in the hospital with leukemia. In-between typically boyish adventures, Jim scribbles in his notebook and experiments with sex and drugs. His group of friends begins to disintegrate after coach Swifty not only makes a pass at Jim, but also catches him and his pals using drugs on the court and kicks them off the team. Out of school and on the streets, Jim turns tricks, betrays friends, robs stores, and deals drugs to feed his heroin addiction. Not even the efforts of former addict Reggie can cure Jim.Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He cannot go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim "picked up a game" now and then, is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity, which ultimately ends with Jim's incarceration in a state penitentiary. After months in the hospital, he gets out and later does a talk show about his drug life, but before that he turned down free drugs given to him by his old friend, Pedro.Jim started out as a practice basketball player, and moved on to writing his memoirs. Although it masquerades as a cautionary tale about the horrors of heroin, this epic of teen-age angst is more accurately seen as a reverential wallow in the gutter of self-absorption.One thing about the plot is that the view never understand what really motivated this intelligent adolescent, a gifted basketball player and sensitive writer, to descend into the hellish life of a drug addict and hustler on the mean streets of New York.It only showed how drugs can destroy one's life.As for the movie,it was a must-see as you get a glimpse of the great actor Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be.

    There was a huge uproar regarding this movie because of a scene where the main character walks into his classroom and starts gunning everybody down with a shotgun. As is typical everybody has missed the whole point of the movie. It is not designed to encourage school shootings, but to show people what heroin is really like. When it comes to violence on television and video games then I will repeat what was said to me once, not that anybody will listen - people are so stubborn that once that have a mindset, no amount of reason will change their mind. Anyway, before television there was an awful lot of violence - the Napoleonic Wars, the thirty years war, the crusades, and even World War I: probably one of the most violent of wars. Even then before literature or even the written language, Cain killed Abel, and he did not do it because a video game made him think that it was a good idea. Violence is apart of our nature and we do it because we are frustrated with the world and the way people react to us. It is basic to our nature, and I am not saying that it is alright, but rather stopping violence in the media is not going to change anything. The Basketball Diaries is about a heroin addict. We follow his life from when he becomes one to when he finally gives up. Even though he does not start off as a heroin addict, he is still taking drugs, or rather sniffing glue. He, Jim Carol, hangs with three other friends and they simply act like teenagers with a lot of energy. Jim is also a champion basketball player. There is a darker side to his life and that is that his best friend is dying of Leukemia. He does not want to believe it, but it is reality and once he dies things slowly begin to change. We are not sure what really happens, but I guess it has something to do with the realisation that they are no longer immortal. But that is not the main reason, it more has to do with the pain and the loss that he suffers after his friend dies, and it is not something that they could have fought against - in fact he was powerless to do anything about it. The realisation of ones weakness is a true humbliser. Starting the addiction is not focused that heavily on in the movie, but his first trip is, and it shows him running through a field of flowers. It is more that he describes how all of his pain has gone away - both the emotional and the physical. This is the thing about Heroin - it is one of the world's best painkillers, but it is also an incredibly addictive drug. What we see is how his life collapses around him as he becomes addicted to Heroin. He is kicked out of school, slowly looses his friends as they are each arrested for various crimes, and finally he himself is taken away as he lies in a pathetic heap before the door to his mothers' apartment. Near the end we even see him resort of Homosexuality, something that horrifies him, especially when he is molested by the basketball coach, to get money for drugs. This is further undermined when the drugs he purchases are fake. The Basketball Diaries is an incredible movie and shows something that we wish to ignore. The school shooting scene is not all that bad, and more shows his frustration with life and the way the drugs take away this frustration - but at a cost. It is something that has been taken right out of proportion and as such people take the wrong idea about the film.

    Jim Carroll's The Basketball Diaries tells in tattered detail how the author went in a few short months from being a Catholic high school basketball star to being a strung-out heroin addict who turned tricks for drugs. Like many such stories, it hangs fondly over the shock and repulsion, and ends with unbecoming quickness after contentment is recovered. Will there ever be a venue for a film about a character who skips through his drug period because he's so excited to show us what he did after he pulled his socks up? Not likely. If there's anything more tiresome than a scandalous parable with a lesson at the end, it's the lesson minus the parable. And so this reverential flounder in the sewer of narcissism shows us profusely that if you become addicted to drugs, you're prone to discover yourself living distraughtly on the streets, selling a body that looks increasingly less like a worthwhile purchase. Carroll was a kid who notwithstanding his misery attempted to develop his experience into prose. The snag with Scott Kalvert's film is that he's apt to translate the experiences too literally: Jim is so urgently pale and miserable that the idealism feels vain. He plays basketball at night in the rain after his best friend dies of leukemia, and it just looks wholly contrived, fake and banal, not poignant. As the film begins, Jim is on the basketball team at a Catholic high school in New York, where a depraved priest drools while spanking disobedient students with a full-size paddle and the class cringes rhythmically. This scene's more indebted to Victorian pornography than to any real private school in 20th century America. Jim and his friends are not upright Catholic boys. They steal from the lockers of the opposing basketball team, and the preferred off-court activity is experimenting with inhalants and pills. Swifty, the coach played by Bruno Kirby, makes implausible passes at Jim. And Jim's mother, played by a sadly wasted Lorraine Bracco, is a crudely flat character who functions here exclusively to implement tough love by kicking him out. Life for Jim is a descending coil of pills, cough medicine, booze, diving off cliffs into the Harlem River, fainting during a game and masturbating on the roof. There are also stirring gleans into the underbelly of users, pushers, hookers and pimps, as Jim floats at large from his comfort zones, while recording all in his diary. Jim's writing predictably operates as a narration. Like most poetry written by teenagers, it's childish idealism, agonizingly earnest, seeing life as sad because the writer's not happy. Soon though, he samples heroin, and "any ache, pain, sadness or guilt was completely flushed out." Remarkable, how real life unravels exactly like the movies. The movie hinges on three hard-wearing formulas: Jim facilitates his dying friend's temporary escape from the hospital so he can push his wheelchair down 42nd Street, Jim sees his ex-teammate on TV playing in an all-star game while Jim is in a squalid bar and, of course, Jim is rescued by a dignified black man, who finds him out cold, brings him home and puts him through cold turkey. In accounts like this, you can continuously rely on a laudable black ex-hoodlum, combing the streets for distressed white kids, functioning for white tolerance soap-boxing purposes as hidden supplies of authenticity and honor. DiCaprio does what he can with the role. Ernie Hudson is solid as the ex-junkie, and there is genuine feeling in Bracco's underwritten mother. But it's Juliette Lewis, as a greasy hooker, who once again taps an utterly real edge. But the movie is not credible. By the end, Jim is seen going in through a stage door, and then we hear him telling the story of his decline and recuperation. We can't determine if this is intended to be actual acknowledgment or a show: That's the whole movie's trouble. While the film has a preachy earnestness more like older films that take drug issues in hand, its mercilessly murky concentration on the despair of drug abuse makes for effective, gripping viewing, if only for purely morbid interest. The teen years, an age of revolt and insecurity in the best of conditions, can be shocking when an individual gets that carried away. This stark, muddled film depicts this, with reductive prurience indeed, but also with brutalizing efficacy.

    Basketball Diaries, The (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Powerful adaptation of Jim Carroll's autobiographical account of his free fall from good student to heroin addict isn't a pretty film to watch but there's no denying its power. Leonard DiCaprio, in his first starring role, plays Carroll who when we first meet him is playing sports and is still in school but soon his minor drug habits start to spin out of control and he finds himself hooked, living on the streets and any hope for the future is nearly gone. I remember going to see THE BASKETBALL DIARIES a week after my fifteenth birthday and still remember what effect it had on me. I really didn't understand all the negative reviews the movie got at the time of its release but I found the film to be remarkably powerful and the message against drug abuse is still very strong in today's time. What all people then agreed on is that star DiCaprio seemed like he could do anything in the world. Coming after supporting roles in films like THIS BOYS LIFE and WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, this was certainly a departure from those two films but it was a real eye-opener because there's some of the most raw and powerful acting that you're ever going to see. The final thirty-minutes of the film pretty much has DiCaprio playing a drugged out character who is just inches away from death and the brutality of the performance is something one isn't going to forget. This is hands down a performance that once you see it it's unlikely to leave your mind and DiCaprio really gives it his all and it's really hard to think of another actor out there who could have given so much to the part. The way DiCaprio just crumbles under the drug abuse is so chilling and haunting that you really do feel as if you're watching a real addict and not just an actor playing a part. The support cast are also quite good with Ernie Hudson coming off extremely strong as a man trying to save the kid and Lorraine Bracco as his mother. Mark Wahlberg, Bruno Kirby and Juliette Lewis are also strong in their roles. I think there are a few issues with the film including too much attempted style by the director and this is really apparent during a sequence where DiCaprio is suffering from withdrawals. The acting is strong enough so the stylistic touches by the director are more distracting than anything else. The screenplay has taken some heat from people but I thought it was pretty good and captured the free-spirit of the novel, which it's based on. THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is as relevant today as it was when first released and it's certainly a terrific showcase for its star who has gone on to prove all those early critics right when they called him one of the greatest actors coming up. The film is a haunting reminder of the downsides of drugs and the rawness of the performances make it hard to watch at times but there's no denying its power.

    I watched this film recently with my girlfriend and several friends having not seen it since around the time when it first came out. I remember at the time thinking how powerful a performance Leonardo Dicaprio gave of Jim Carrol's real life character. The performance was so good I remember at the time telling friends who had recently seen Titanic, that they will be shocked by this performance as it proved he is one of the most versatile actors in cinema today and then. Over the years I have told people I have met, you need to see this movie but not many have and it seems to have sneaked under the radar a little. Therefore when It was on television recently I made everyone watch this film. Everyone who did came back to me saying the same thing, 'wasn't leo good in it'!! The scenes involving Carrol begging his mother to let him into the apartment so he can ask for money to help feed his drug habit are shockingly powerful. Its an amazing portrayal of the dangers of drug addiction and how it can effect young people who dabble with the dangers so quickly, turning their lives on its head with out them realising how it even happened. some strong messages in this film that many teenagers need to watch. Having watched it again some years later, It has dated slightly in time but not only Leo is outstanding but Mark Whalberg shows that he too was showing potential back then 15 years ago or so. I have never been too sure of Whalberg in the past sometimes mixing natural acting ability in movies such as 'the fighter' or his interesting performance of the character police detective 'dignam' in the departed with shocking performances such as 'the happening or Planet of the Apes (where to be honest I don't blame him but the directors for poor casting). But Wharlberg in this movie shows genuine class, perhaps portraying a young man who had an adolecence pretty similar to his diaries character 'mickey'. on a whole the film is a class act and hidden gem. A must see.

    I thought "The Basketball Diaries" was a really good book, but this particular screen translation was bungled. Though a diary, the book is surprisingly well-written considering the author wrote it in his early teens, and it provides a great deal of insight into the world of Irish-Catholic youth in New York City during the 1960's. It's all real, but it reads like a good novel (I honestly liked it a lot more than "The Catcher in the Rye," and even "Junkie" by William S. Burroughs). It is also incredibly graphic, particularly in how it deals with Carroll prostituting himself to support his heroin addiction. I can't think of a single novel written by an adult about teenage life that has balls like that. The problem with the movie is that it totally misses the point of the book. Since Carroll is writing about himself, the book is completely non-judgemental. It simply documents the events. The movie, on the other hand, is like the after-school special version of the book. DiCaprio's character tries heroin, and in the very next scene, he's a filthy bum living in an alleyway. No insight is provided into heroin addiction at all; it's simply more Reagan-era "Just say no" religious crap. The ending in the book is also much bleaker than the ending in the film, which actually ends about 2/3rds of the way through the book, if I remember correctly. I do think the actors in the film were all terrific, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives a surprisingly mature performance. Ernie Hudson was also great, and the photography was gorgeous. But the movie itself just sucks. Read the book instead.

    Ever since hearing the commentary track of Paul Thomas Anderson for the Boogie Nights DVD (I heard it like in early 2008), this title, Scott Kalvert's The Basketball Diaries, came to stay in my mind. I really love the way P.T. Anderson, like Tarantino or now Edgar Wright, talks about his influences, about film in general, and in this case after hearing that he cast Mark Walhberg after seeing his performance in The Basketball Diaries ("god, he was good, god, I though he was so good" Â– and Mark made sure P.T. Anderson wanted him for his acting and not for his body!) definitely made me want to check it out (I Am Cuba is another of the titles that stayed with me thanks to that commentary. I still have to watch it tough). And P.T. Anderson explains that actually his first choice for that part was Leonardo DiCaprio. He doesn't specify, but it's very probable that DiCaprio became his choice also due to The Basketball Diaries (however he decided to do Titanic instead). Anyway, there is not a R4 DVD around that I know, so it was until some weeks ago, when I found on ebay a really cheap R1 DVD of it, when I sort of recall everything and finally got it. When you see a movie with the title of "The Basketball Diaries" and a very young DiCaprio, I mean, a young blonde kid in school clothes in its DVD cover you may not think of it as something really interesting. Definitely you don't think of it as a strong movie about the consequences of drug addiction. This is a movie that deals with the downfall of some very talented young basketball players. It has few to offer for those seeking for a straight sports movie though. We learn that our characters really can play basketball, and pretty much that's it. This is really a straight drug movie. And it's a really good one even though it doesn't really add something "brand-new" to the drug movie sort of formula (but we probably have here the basketball game with the most doped players. That scene features the Doors' "Riders on the Storm", which is pretty cool indeed). My sort of analogy goes with the thing that DiCaprio became like a different actor once he began working with Martin Scorsese back in 2002. He definitely left Titanic behind. Maybe before Scorsese but hell, since Gangs of New York I, at least, see a different DiCaprio. So here in The Basketball Diaries we have like the two DiCaprio. The movie at first sight is a coming of age one with the Titanic DiCaprio suffering the type of education that his Catholic school gives but also having fun with his friends (all are part of a great Catholic basketball team that is pretty much invincible) and stuff; it's a "kids being kids" kind of story. Once the movie gets much darker we get to see the Scorsese DiCaprio. Somehow some scenes really make see the very intense DiCaprio from the Scorsese films. It was a surprise to have him here doing something like that, two years before Titanic (I have yet to see What's Eating Gilbert Grape, for which he earned his first Oscar nomination back in 1994). This is worth watching stuff.

    Based on the autobiographical novel written by Jim Carroll, The Basketball Diaries follows one young man's descent into addiction, crime and homelessness. Jim (here played with mature dedication by Leonardo Di Caprio) is a promising high school basketball player, who along with his three friends, enjoy shooting hoops and getting into general mischief. What starts out as a past-time, soon deteriorates into something more deprived and desperate, as Jim sees his world crash around him as his drug habit becomes an unstoppable affliction. When Jim's situation gets so desperate that he leaves home to hustle and rob on the streets, he begins to push away the people in his life that were once close to him. His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, throws him out after the extremities of his situation become apparent to her and refuses him back. Reggie (Ernie Hudson) was an inspirational figure and mentor to Jim and regularly met up to play basketball in the court. And Neutron (Patrick McGaw) distances himself from Jim and his friends' habits and focuses on his basketball career, much to Jim's dismay. These people will all have a profound effect on Jim's eventual redemption. The film also switches the book's real-life setting from 1960's New York to the 90's. What The Basketball Diaries attempts to do is to create a realistic and gritty (a phrase that seems to be thrown around a lot these days) depiction of drug abuse, and create a hellish portrait of a confused young man who his throwing away his many talents in favour of a life that is doing nothing but ruining his life and isolating the people around him. In reality, this is a terribly-directed film that seems to sledgehammer the phrase 'drugs are bad' into the viewers skull, rather than having the nerve, or in deed the respect, to let the audience make their own mind up. Or maybe the director doesn't have the skill to create a film capable of conjuring up those feelings in the viewer. It sounds ridiculous, but if you have seen the South Park episode where Mr Mackey is giving his anti-drug lecture by simply listing the drugs that are 'bad', then you can see a clear parallel to this film. Jim basically goes from one drug to the other and one crime to the next. It's not interesting, convincing, and to be honest I found it all just very annoying. Jim is a character of no redeeming qualities. He's selfish, careless, and is basically a whiny little kid. Fair enough, this is a chance to develop an interesting, fully-rounded character, but director Scott Kalvert and scriptwriter Bryan Goluboff cannot combine their 'skills' to pull it off. Even though Jim narrates the film and reveals everything about his feelings and opinions, and Di Caprio's fantastic performance, we never get inside Jim's head enough to understand him and why he is willing to give up on a fledging basketball career. This is a character that we're supposed to be praying for to overcome his addiction, but (spoilers!) when his clean-break arrived, I asked myself should I be feeling happy for this arsehole? A well-acted film all-round, namely from the lead and Mark Wahlberg as his friend Mickey, but a film that is swamped in faults and scenes that are just ridiculous. Possibly only remotely remembered for the controversial scene where Jim storms his school with a shotgun in a drug-addled fantasy, which was caught up in the media storm surrounding the Columbine High School massacre. Watch only for signs of early promise from Di Caprio, but otherwise avoid. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    The Basketball Diaries is the movie that showed exactly how much acting potential Leonardo DiCaprio has. The good. Gripping sad story. Extreme realism and superb acting, you really get into their shoes, very immersive. You get to understand their story, their situation. Tight well executed scenes. Nice camera work. Solid score. The actors. Not only does Leonardo DiCaprio shine like a true star, but Mark Wahlberg also shows his talent. The rest of the cast is almost as impeccable. The bad. The end scene on the stage is badly staged. No pun intended. It's a bit awkward, but it's easily forgivable. The ugly. It pictures drugs as a social disease whereas their use is actually a symptom of an underlying problem. But then, everybody thinks that, because that's the official story. The result. It's a forbidding tale, but everyone should watch it and understand.

    This film isn't for everyone, you either hate it or love it. It sometimes lacks that constant up-beat easy to watch feel that certain types of audiences need to enjoy a film and is replaced with brutal honesty.The performances from all of the actors were outstanding, with Leonardo DiCaprio performing some of the best acting I have ever seen. His portrayal of Jim was so real and raw that he gave so much of himself to the role that it began to look effortless. So many scenes in this movie were beautifully done. A few stand out moments to name: The basketball scene in the rain, every confrontation between Jim and his mother, and the Withdrawal scene where once again Leo gives a spine tingling performance. If you want to enjoy The Basketball diaries you must go into it with an open mind and take the film for what it is. It isn't a fancy, modern, stylized, glamorized film about drugs but rather an honest, raw, bold and touching movie about the self-destruction of a boy who falls head first into the harrowing world of drug addiction. This movie for me is an overlooked, underrated piece of art. Which is why I love it. I wouldn't change one thing about it.

    Very loosely based on the memoir of the same name, The Basketball Diaries transposes the late '60s adolescence of writer and artist Jim Carroll to some unspecified time period at least 15 years later, further confusing the time frame with three decades of rock music, some by Carroll himself.The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Lorraine Bracco, James Madio, and Mark Wahlberg.It was directed by Scott Kalvert. Jim and his Catholic school chums are on the hottest basketball team in New York, but their friend Bobby languishes in the hospital with leukemia. In-between typically boyish adventures, Jim scribbles in his notebook and experiments with sex and drugs. His group of friends begins to disintegrate after coach Swifty not only makes a pass at Jim, but also catches him and his pals using drugs on the court and kicks them off the team. Out of school and on the streets, Jim turns tricks, betrays friends, robs stores, and deals drugs to feed his heroin addiction. Not even the efforts of former addict Reggie can cure Jim.Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He cannot go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim "picked up a game" now and then, is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity, which ultimately ends with Jim's incarceration in a state penitentiary. After months in the hospital, he gets out and later does a talk show about his drug life, but before that he turned down free drugs given to him by his old friend, Pedro.Jim started out as a practice basketball player, and moved on to writing his memoirs. Although it masquerades as a cautionary tale about the horrors of heroin, this epic of teen-age angst is more accurately seen as a reverential wallow in the gutter of self-absorption.One thing about the plot is that the view never understand what really motivated this intelligent adolescent, a gifted basketball player and sensitive writer, to descend into the hellish life of a drug addict and hustler on the mean streets of New York.It only showed how drugs can destroy one's life.As for the movie,it was a must-see as you get a glimpse of the great actor Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be.

When it comes to violence on television and video games then I will repeat what was said to me once, not that anybody will listen - people are so stubborn that once that have a mindset, no amount of reason will change their mind. Anyway, before television there was an awful lot of violence - the Napoleonic Wars, the thirty years war, the crusades, and even World War I: probably one of the most violent of wars.

Violence is apart of our nature and we do it because we are frustrated with the world and the way people react to us. It is basic to our nature, and I am not saying that it is alright, but rather stopping violence in the media is not going to change anything. The Basketball Diaries is about a heroin addict. We follow his life from when he becomes one to when he finally gives up. Even though he does not start off as a heroin addict, he is still taking drugs, or rather sniffing glue. He, Jim Carol, hangs with three other friends and they simply act like teenagers with a lot of energy. Jim is also a champion basketball player. There is a darker side to his life and that is that his best friend is dying of Leukemia. He does not want to believe it, but it is reality and once he dies things slowly begin to change. We are not sure what really happens, but I guess it has something to do with the realisation that they are no longer immortal. But that is not the main reason, it more has to do with the pain and the loss that he suffers after his friend dies, and it is not something that they could have fought against - in fact he was powerless to do anything about it.

It is more that he describes how all of his pain has gone away - both the emotional and the physical. This is the thing about Heroin - it is one of the world's best painkillers, but it is also an incredibly addictive drug. What we see is how his life collapses around him as he becomes addicted to Heroin. He is kicked out of school, slowly looses his friends as they are each arrested for various crimes, and finally he himself is taken away as he lies in a pathetic heap before the door to his mothers' apartment. Near the end we even see him resort of Homosexuality, something that horrifies him, especially when he is molested by the basketball coach, to get money for drugs. This is further undermined when the drugs he purchases are fake. The Basketball Diaries is an incredible movie and shows something that we wish to ignore. The school shooting scene is not all that bad, and more shows his frustration with life and the way the drugs take away this frustration - but at a cost. It is something that has been taken right out of proportion and as such people take the wrong idea about the film.

    Jim Carroll's The Basketball Diaries tells in tattered detail how the author went in a few short months from being a Catholic high school basketball star to being a strung-out heroin addict who turned tricks for drugs. Like many such stories, it hangs fondly over the shock and repulsion, and ends with unbecoming quickness after contentment is recovered. Will there ever be a venue for a film about a character who skips through his drug period because he's so excited to show us what he did after he pulled his socks up? Not likely. If there's anything more tiresome than a scandalous parable with a lesson at the end, it's the lesson minus the parable. And so this reverential flounder in the sewer of narcissism shows us profusely that if you become addicted to drugs, you're prone to discover yourself living distraughtly on the streets, selling a body that looks increasingly less like a worthwhile purchase. Carroll was a kid who notwithstanding his misery attempted to develop his experience into prose. The snag with Scott Kalvert's film is that he's apt to translate the experiences too literally: Jim is so urgently pale and miserable that the idealism feels vain. He plays basketball at night in the rain after his best friend dies of leukemia, and it just looks wholly contrived, fake and banal, not poignant. As the film begins, Jim is on the basketball team at a Catholic high school in New York, where a depraved priest drools while spanking disobedient students with a full-size paddle and the class cringes rhythmically. This scene's more indebted to Victorian pornography than to any real private school in 20th century America. Jim and his friends are not upright Catholic boys. They steal from the lockers of the opposing basketball team, and the preferred off-court activity is experimenting with inhalants and pills. Swifty, the coach played by Bruno Kirby, makes implausible passes at Jim. And Jim's mother, played by a sadly wasted Lorraine Bracco, is a crudely flat character who functions here exclusively to implement tough love by kicking him out. Life for Jim is a descending coil of pills, cough medicine, booze, diving off cliffs into the Harlem River, fainting during a game and masturbating on the roof. There are also stirring gleans into the underbelly of users, pushers, hookers and pimps, as Jim floats at large from his comfort zones, while recording all in his diary. Jim's writing predictably operates as a narration. Like most poetry written by teenagers, it's childish idealism, agonizingly earnest, seeing life as sad because the writer's not happy. Soon though, he samples heroin, and "any ache, pain, sadness or guilt was completely flushed out." Remarkable, how real life unravels exactly like the movies. The movie hinges on three hard-wearing formulas: Jim facilitates his dying friend's temporary escape from the hospital so he can push his wheelchair down 42nd Street, Jim sees his ex-teammate on TV playing in an all-star game while Jim is in a squalid bar and, of course, Jim is rescued by a dignified black man, who finds him out cold, brings him home and puts him through cold turkey. In accounts like this, you can continuously rely on a laudable black ex-hoodlum, combing the streets for distressed white kids, functioning for white tolerance soap-boxing purposes as hidden supplies of authenticity and honor. DiCaprio does what he can with the role. Ernie Hudson is solid as the ex-junkie, and there is genuine feeling in Bracco's underwritten mother. But it's Juliette Lewis, as a greasy hooker, who once again taps an utterly real edge. But the movie is not credible. By the end, Jim is seen going in through a stage door, and then we hear him telling the story of his decline and recuperation. We can't determine if this is intended to be actual acknowledgment or a show: That's the whole movie's trouble. While the film has a preachy earnestness more like older films that take drug issues in hand, its mercilessly murky concentration on the despair of drug abuse makes for effective, gripping viewing, if only for purely morbid interest. The teen years, an age of revolt and insecurity in the best of conditions, can be shocking when an individual gets that carried away. This stark, muddled film depicts this, with reductive prurience indeed, but also with brutalizing efficacy.

    Basketball Diaries, The (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Powerful adaptation of Jim Carroll's autobiographical account of his free fall from good student to heroin addict isn't a pretty film to watch but there's no denying its power. Leonard DiCaprio, in his first starring role, plays Carroll who when we first meet him is playing sports and is still in school but soon his minor drug habits start to spin out of control and he finds himself hooked, living on the streets and any hope for the future is nearly gone. I remember going to see THE BASKETBALL DIARIES a week after my fifteenth birthday and still remember what effect it had on me. I really didn't understand all the negative reviews the movie got at the time of its release but I found the film to be remarkably powerful and the message against drug abuse is still very strong in today's time. What all people then agreed on is that star DiCaprio seemed like he could do anything in the world. Coming after supporting roles in films like THIS BOYS LIFE and WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, this was certainly a departure from those two films but it was a real eye-opener because there's some of the most raw and powerful acting that you're ever going to see. The final thirty-minutes of the film pretty much has DiCaprio playing a drugged out character who is just inches away from death and the brutality of the performance is something one isn't going to forget. This is hands down a performance that once you see it it's unlikely to leave your mind and DiCaprio really gives it his all and it's really hard to think of another actor out there who could have given so much to the part. The way DiCaprio just crumbles under the drug abuse is so chilling and haunting that you really do feel as if you're watching a real addict and not just an actor playing a part. The support cast are also quite good with Ernie Hudson coming off extremely strong as a man trying to save the kid and Lorraine Bracco as his mother. Mark Wahlberg, Bruno Kirby and Juliette Lewis are also strong in their roles. I think there are a few issues with the film including too much attempted style by the director and this is really apparent during a sequence where DiCaprio is suffering from withdrawals. The acting is strong enough so the stylistic touches by the director are more distracting than anything else. The screenplay has taken some heat from people but I thought it was pretty good and captured the free-spirit of the novel, which it's based on. THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is as relevant today as it was when first released and it's certainly a terrific showcase for its star who has gone on to prove all those early critics right when they called him one of the greatest actors coming up. The film is a haunting reminder of the downsides of drugs and the rawness of the performances make it hard to watch at times but there's no denying its power.

    I watched this film recently with my girlfriend and several friends having not seen it since around the time when it first came out. I remember at the time thinking how powerful a performance Leonardo Dicaprio gave of Jim Carrol's real life character. The performance was so good I remember at the time telling friends who had recently seen Titanic, that they will be shocked by this performance as it proved he is one of the most versatile actors in cinema today and then. Over the years I have told people I have met, you need to see this movie but not many have and it seems to have sneaked under the radar a little. Therefore when It was on television recently I made everyone watch this film. Everyone who did came back to me saying the same thing, 'wasn't leo good in it'!! The scenes involving Carrol begging his mother to let him into the apartment so he can ask for money to help feed his drug habit are shockingly powerful. Its an amazing portrayal of the dangers of drug addiction and how it can effect young people who dabble with the dangers so quickly, turning their lives on its head with out them realising how it even happened. some strong messages in this film that many teenagers need to watch. Having watched it again some years later, It has dated slightly in time but not only Leo is outstanding but Mark Whalberg shows that he too was showing potential back then 15 years ago or so. I have never been too sure of Whalberg in the past sometimes mixing natural acting ability in movies such as 'the fighter' or his interesting performance of the character police detective 'dignam' in the departed with shocking performances such as 'the happening or Planet of the Apes (where to be honest I don't blame him but the directors for poor casting). But Wharlberg in this movie shows genuine class, perhaps portraying a young man who had an adolecence pretty similar to his diaries character 'mickey'. on a whole the film is a class act and hidden gem. A must see.

    I thought "The Basketball Diaries" was a really good book, but this particular screen translation was bungled. Though a diary, the book is surprisingly well-written considering the author wrote it in his early teens, and it provides a great deal of insight into the world of Irish-Catholic youth in New York City during the 1960's. It's all real, but it reads like a good novel (I honestly liked it a lot more than "The Catcher in the Rye," and even "Junkie" by William S. Burroughs). It is also incredibly graphic, particularly in how it deals with Carroll prostituting himself to support his heroin addiction. I can't think of a single novel written by an adult about teenage life that has balls like that. The problem with the movie is that it totally misses the point of the book. Since Carroll is writing about himself, the book is completely non-judgemental. It simply documents the events. The movie, on the other hand, is like the after-school special version of the book. DiCaprio's character tries heroin, and in the very next scene, he's a filthy bum living in an alleyway. No insight is provided into heroin addiction at all; it's simply more Reagan-era "Just say no" religious crap. The ending in the book is also much bleaker than the ending in the film, which actually ends about 2/3rds of the way through the book, if I remember correctly. I do think the actors in the film were all terrific, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives a surprisingly mature performance. Ernie Hudson was also great, and the photography was gorgeous. But the movie itself just sucks. Read the book instead.

    Ever since hearing the commentary track of Paul Thomas Anderson for the Boogie Nights DVD (I heard it like in early 2008), this title, Scott Kalvert's The Basketball Diaries, came to stay in my mind. I really love the way P.T. Anderson, like Tarantino or now Edgar Wright, talks about his influences, about film in general, and in this case after hearing that he cast Mark Walhberg after seeing his performance in The Basketball Diaries ("god, he was good, god, I though he was so good" Â– and Mark made sure P.T. Anderson wanted him for his acting and not for his body!) definitely made me want to check it out (I Am Cuba is another of the titles that stayed with me thanks to that commentary. I still have to watch it tough). And P.T. Anderson explains that actually his first choice for that part was Leonardo DiCaprio. He doesn't specify, but it's very probable that DiCaprio became his choice also due to The Basketball Diaries (however he decided to do Titanic instead). Anyway, there is not a R4 DVD around that I know, so it was until some weeks ago, when I found on ebay a really cheap R1 DVD of it, when I sort of recall everything and finally got it. When you see a movie with the title of "The Basketball Diaries" and a very young DiCaprio, I mean, a young blonde kid in school clothes in its DVD cover you may not think of it as something really interesting. Definitely you don't think of it as a strong movie about the consequences of drug addiction. This is a movie that deals with the downfall of some very talented young basketball players. It has few to offer for those seeking for a straight sports movie though. We learn that our characters really can play basketball, and pretty much that's it. This is really a straight drug movie. And it's a really good one even though it doesn't really add something "brand-new" to the drug movie sort of formula (but we probably have here the basketball game with the most doped players. That scene features the Doors' "Riders on the Storm", which is pretty cool indeed). My sort of analogy goes with the thing that DiCaprio became like a different actor once he began working with Martin Scorsese back in 2002. He definitely left Titanic behind. Maybe before Scorsese but hell, since Gangs of New York I, at least, see a different DiCaprio. So here in The Basketball Diaries we have like the two DiCaprio. The movie at first sight is a coming of age one with the Titanic DiCaprio suffering the type of education that his Catholic school gives but also having fun with his friends (all are part of a great Catholic basketball team that is pretty much invincible) and stuff; it's a "kids being kids" kind of story. Once the movie gets much darker we get to see the Scorsese DiCaprio. Somehow some scenes really make see the very intense DiCaprio from the Scorsese films. It was a surprise to have him here doing something like that, two years before Titanic (I have yet to see What's Eating Gilbert Grape, for which he earned his first Oscar nomination back in 1994). This is worth watching stuff.

    Based on the autobiographical novel written by Jim Carroll, The Basketball Diaries follows one young man's descent into addiction, crime and homelessness. Jim (here played with mature dedication by Leonardo Di Caprio) is a promising high school basketball player, who along with his three friends, enjoy shooting hoops and getting into general mischief. What starts out as a past-time, soon deteriorates into something more deprived and desperate, as Jim sees his world crash around him as his drug habit becomes an unstoppable affliction. When Jim's situation gets so desperate that he leaves home to hustle and rob on the streets, he begins to push away the people in his life that were once close to him. His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, throws him out after the extremities of his situation become apparent to her and refuses him back. Reggie (Ernie Hudson) was an inspirational figure and mentor to Jim and regularly met up to play basketball in the court. And Neutron (Patrick McGaw) distances himself from Jim and his friends' habits and focuses on his basketball career, much to Jim's dismay. These people will all have a profound effect on Jim's eventual redemption. The film also switches the book's real-life setting from 1960's New York to the 90's. What The Basketball Diaries attempts to do is to create a realistic and gritty (a phrase that seems to be thrown around a lot these days) depiction of drug abuse, and create a hellish portrait of a confused young man who his throwing away his many talents in favour of a life that is doing nothing but ruining his life and isolating the people around him. In reality, this is a terribly-directed film that seems to sledgehammer the phrase 'drugs are bad' into the viewers skull, rather than having the nerve, or in deed the respect, to let the audience make their own mind up. Or maybe the director doesn't have the skill to create a film capable of conjuring up those feelings in the viewer. It sounds ridiculous, but if you have seen the South Park episode where Mr Mackey is giving his anti-drug lecture by simply listing the drugs that are 'bad', then you can see a clear parallel to this film. Jim basically goes from one drug to the other and one crime to the next. It's not interesting, convincing, and to be honest I found it all just very annoying. Jim is a character of no redeeming qualities. He's selfish, careless, and is basically a whiny little kid. Fair enough, this is a chance to develop an interesting, fully-rounded character, but director Scott Kalvert and scriptwriter Bryan Goluboff cannot combine their 'skills' to pull it off. Even though Jim narrates the film and reveals everything about his feelings and opinions, and Di Caprio's fantastic performance, we never get inside Jim's head enough to understand him and why he is willing to give up on a fledging basketball career. This is a character that we're supposed to be praying for to overcome his addiction, but (spoilers!) when his clean-break arrived, I asked myself should I be feeling happy for this arsehole? A well-acted film all-round, namely from the lead and Mark Wahlberg as his friend Mickey, but a film that is swamped in faults and scenes that are just ridiculous. Possibly only remotely remembered for the controversial scene where Jim storms his school with a shotgun in a drug-addled fantasy, which was caught up in the media storm surrounding the Columbine High School massacre. Watch only for signs of early promise from Di Caprio, but otherwise avoid. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    The Basketball Diaries is the movie that showed exactly how much acting potential Leonardo DiCaprio has. The good. Gripping sad story. Extreme realism and superb acting, you really get into their shoes, very immersive. You get to understand their story, their situation. Tight well executed scenes. Nice camera work. Solid score. The actors. Not only does Leonardo DiCaprio shine like a true star, but Mark Wahlberg also shows his talent. The rest of the cast is almost as impeccable. The bad. The end scene on the stage is badly staged. No pun intended. It's a bit awkward, but it's easily forgivable. The ugly. It pictures drugs as a social disease whereas their use is actually a symptom of an underlying problem. But then, everybody thinks that, because that's the official story. The result. It's a forbidding tale, but everyone should watch it and understand.

    This film isn't for everyone, you either hate it or love it. It sometimes lacks that constant up-beat easy to watch feel that certain types of audiences need to enjoy a film and is replaced with brutal honesty.The performances from all of the actors were outstanding, with Leonardo DiCaprio performing some of the best acting I have ever seen. His portrayal of Jim was so real and raw that he gave so much of himself to the role that it began to look effortless. So many scenes in this movie were beautifully done. A few stand out moments to name: The basketball scene in the rain, every confrontation between Jim and his mother, and the Withdrawal scene where once again Leo gives a spine tingling performance. If you want to enjoy The Basketball diaries you must go into it with an open mind and take the film for what it is. It isn't a fancy, modern, stylized, glamorized film about drugs but rather an honest, raw, bold and touching movie about the self-destruction of a boy who falls head first into the harrowing world of drug addiction. This movie for me is an overlooked, underrated piece of art. Which is why I love it. I wouldn't change one thing about it.

    Very loosely based on the memoir of the same name, The Basketball Diaries transposes the late '60s adolescence of writer and artist Jim Carroll to some unspecified time period at least 15 years later, further confusing the time frame with three decades of rock music, some by Carroll himself.The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Lorraine Bracco, James Madio, and Mark Wahlberg.It was directed by Scott Kalvert. Jim and his Catholic school chums are on the hottest basketball team in New York, but their friend Bobby languishes in the hospital with leukemia. In-between typically boyish adventures, Jim scribbles in his notebook and experiments with sex and drugs. His group of friends begins to disintegrate after coach Swifty not only makes a pass at Jim, but also catches him and his pals using drugs on the court and kicks them off the team. Out of school and on the streets, Jim turns tricks, betrays friends, robs stores, and deals drugs to feed his heroin addiction. Not even the efforts of former addict Reggie can cure Jim.Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He cannot go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim "picked up a game" now and then, is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity, which ultimately ends with Jim's incarceration in a state penitentiary. After months in the hospital, he gets out and later does a talk show about his drug life, but before that he turned down free drugs given to him by his old friend, Pedro.Jim started out as a practice basketball player, and moved on to writing his memoirs. Although it masquerades as a cautionary tale about the horrors of heroin, this epic of teen-age angst is more accurately seen as a reverential wallow in the gutter of self-absorption.One thing about the plot is that the view never understand what really motivated this intelligent adolescent, a gifted basketball player and sensitive writer, to descend into the hellish life of a drug addict and hustler on the mean streets of New York.It only showed how drugs can destroy one's life.As for the movie,it was a must-see as you get a glimpse of the great actor Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be.

    There was a huge uproar regarding this movie because of a scene where the main character walks into his classroom and starts gunning everybody down with a shotgun. As is typical everybody has missed the whole point of the movie. It is not designed to encourage school shootings, but to show people what heroin is really like. When it comes to violence on television and video games then I will repeat what was said to me once, not that anybody will listen - people are so stubborn that once that have a mindset, no amount of reason will change their mind. Anyway, before television there was an awful lot of violence - the Napoleonic Wars, the thirty years war, the crusades, and even World War I: probably one of the most violent of wars. Even then before literature or even the written language, Cain killed Abel, and he did not do it because a video game made him think that it was a good idea. Violence is apart of our nature and we do it because we are frustrated with the world and the way people react to us. It is basic to our nature, and I am not saying that it is alright, but rather stopping violence in the media is not going to change anything. The Basketball Diaries is about a heroin addict. We follow his life from when he becomes one to when he finally gives up. Even though he does not start off as a heroin addict, he is still taking drugs, or rather sniffing glue. He, Jim Carol, hangs with three other friends and they simply act like teenagers with a lot of energy. Jim is also a champion basketball player. There is a darker side to his life and that is that his best friend is dying of Leukemia. He does not want to believe it, but it is reality and once he dies things slowly begin to change. We are not sure what really happens, but I guess it has something to do with the realisation that they are no longer immortal. But that is not the main reason, it more has to do with the pain and the loss that he suffers after his friend dies, and it is not something that they could have fought against - in fact he was powerless to do anything about it. The realisation of ones weakness is a true humbliser. Starting the addiction is not focused that heavily on in the movie, but his first trip is, and it shows him running through a field of flowers. It is more that he describes how all of his pain has gone away - both the emotional and the physical. This is the thing about Heroin - it is one of the world's best painkillers, but it is also an incredibly addictive drug. What we see is how his life collapses around him as he becomes addicted to Heroin. He is kicked out of school, slowly looses his friends as they are each arrested for various crimes, and finally he himself is taken away as he lies in a pathetic heap before the door to his mothers' apartment. Near the end we even see him resort of Homosexuality, something that horrifies him, especially when he is molested by the basketball coach, to get money for drugs. This is further undermined when the drugs he purchases are fake. The Basketball Diaries is an incredible movie and shows something that we wish to ignore. The school shooting scene is not all that bad, and more shows his frustration with life and the way the drugs take away this frustration - but at a cost. It is something that has been taken right out of proportion and as such people take the wrong idea about the film.

    Jim Carroll's The Basketball Diaries tells in tattered detail how the author went in a few short months from being a Catholic high school basketball star to being a strung-out heroin addict who turned tricks for drugs. Like many such stories, it hangs fondly over the shock and repulsion, and ends with unbecoming quickness after contentment is recovered. Will there ever be a venue for a film about a character who skips through his drug period because he's so excited to show us what he did after he pulled his socks up? Not likely. If there's anything more tiresome than a scandalous parable with a lesson at the end, it's the lesson minus the parable. And so this reverential flounder in the sewer of narcissism shows us profusely that if you become addicted to drugs, you're prone to discover yourself living distraughtly on the streets, selling a body that looks increasingly less like a worthwhile purchase. Carroll was a kid who notwithstanding his misery attempted to develop his experience into prose. The snag with Scott Kalvert's film is that he's apt to translate the experiences too literally: Jim is so urgently pale and miserable that the idealism feels vain. He plays basketball at night in the rain after his best friend dies of leukemia, and it just looks wholly contrived, fake and banal, not poignant. As the film begins, Jim is on the basketball team at a Catholic high school in New York, where a depraved priest drools while spanking disobedient students with a full-size paddle and the class cringes rhythmically. This scene's more indebted to Victorian pornography than to any real private school in 20th century America. Jim and his friends are not upright Catholic boys. They steal from the lockers of the opposing basketball team, and the preferred off-court activity is experimenting with inhalants and pills. Swifty, the coach played by Bruno Kirby, makes implausible passes at Jim. And Jim's mother, played by a sadly wasted Lorraine Bracco, is a crudely flat character who functions here exclusively to implement tough love by kicking him out. Life for Jim is a descending coil of pills, cough medicine, booze, diving off cliffs into the Harlem River, fainting during a game and masturbating on the roof. There are also stirring gleans into the underbelly of users, pushers, hookers and pimps, as Jim floats at large from his comfort zones, while recording all in his diary. Jim's writing predictably operates as a narration. Like most poetry written by teenagers, it's childish idealism, agonizingly earnest, seeing life as sad because the writer's not happy. Soon though, he samples heroin, and "any ache, pain, sadness or guilt was completely flushed out." Remarkable, how real life unravels exactly like the movies. The movie hinges on three hard-wearing formulas: Jim facilitates his dying friend's temporary escape from the hospital so he can push his wheelchair down 42nd Street, Jim sees his ex-teammate on TV playing in an all-star game while Jim is in a squalid bar and, of course, Jim is rescued by a dignified black man, who finds him out cold, brings him home and puts him through cold turkey. In accounts like this, you can continuously rely on a laudable black ex-hoodlum, combing the streets for distressed white kids, functioning for white tolerance soap-boxing purposes as hidden supplies of authenticity and honor. DiCaprio does what he can with the role. Ernie Hudson is solid as the ex-junkie, and there is genuine feeling in Bracco's underwritten mother. But it's Juliette Lewis, as a greasy hooker, who once again taps an utterly real edge. But the movie is not credible. By the end, Jim is seen going in through a stage door, and then we hear him telling the story of his decline and recuperation. We can't determine if this is intended to be actual acknowledgment or a show: That's the whole movie's trouble. While the film has a preachy earnestness more like older films that take drug issues in hand, its mercilessly murky concentration on the despair of drug abuse makes for effective, gripping viewing, if only for purely morbid interest. The teen years, an age of revolt and insecurity in the best of conditions, can be shocking when an individual gets that carried away. This stark, muddled film depicts this, with reductive prurience indeed, but also with brutalizing efficacy.

    Basketball Diaries, The (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Powerful adaptation of Jim Carroll's autobiographical account of his free fall from good student to heroin addict isn't a pretty film to watch but there's no denying its power. Leonard DiCaprio, in his first starring role, plays Carroll who when we first meet him is playing sports and is still in school but soon his minor drug habits start to spin out of control and he finds himself hooked, living on the streets and any hope for the future is nearly gone. I remember going to see THE BASKETBALL DIARIES a week after my fifteenth birthday and still remember what effect it had on me. I really didn't understand all the negative reviews the movie got at the time of its release but I found the film to be remarkably powerful and the message against drug abuse is still very strong in today's time. What all people then agreed on is that star DiCaprio seemed like he could do anything in the world. Coming after supporting roles in films like THIS BOYS LIFE and WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, this was certainly a departure from those two films but it was a real eye-opener because there's some of the most raw and powerful acting that you're ever going to see. The final thirty-minutes of the film pretty much has DiCaprio playing a drugged out character who is just inches away from death and the brutality of the performance is something one isn't going to forget. This is hands down a performance that once you see it it's unlikely to leave your mind and DiCaprio really gives it his all and it's really hard to think of another actor out there who could have given so much to the part. The way DiCaprio just crumbles under the drug abuse is so chilling and haunting that you really do feel as if you're watching a real addict and not just an actor playing a part. The support cast are also quite good with Ernie Hudson coming off extremely strong as a man trying to save the kid and Lorraine Bracco as his mother. Mark Wahlberg, Bruno Kirby and Juliette Lewis are also strong in their roles. I think there are a few issues with the film including too much attempted style by the director and this is really apparent during a sequence where DiCaprio is suffering from withdrawals. The acting is strong enough so the stylistic touches by the director are more distracting than anything else. The screenplay has taken some heat from people but I thought it was pretty good and captured the free-spirit of the novel, which it's based on. THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is as relevant today as it was when first released and it's certainly a terrific showcase for its star who has gone on to prove all those early critics right when they called him one of the greatest actors coming up. The film is a haunting reminder of the downsides of drugs and the rawness of the performances make it hard to watch at times but there's no denying its power.

    I watched this film recently with my girlfriend and several friends having not seen it since around the time when it first came out. I remember at the time thinking how powerful a performance Leonardo Dicaprio gave of Jim Carrol's real life character. The performance was so good I remember at the time telling friends who had recently seen Titanic, that they will be shocked by this performance as it proved he is one of the most versatile actors in cinema today and then. Over the years I have told people I have met, you need to see this movie but not many have and it seems to have sneaked under the radar a little. Therefore when It was on television recently I made everyone watch this film. Everyone who did came back to me saying the same thing, 'wasn't leo good in it'!! The scenes involving Carrol begging his mother to let him into the apartment so he can ask for money to help feed his drug habit are shockingly powerful. Its an amazing portrayal of the dangers of drug addiction and how it can effect young people who dabble with the dangers so quickly, turning their lives on its head with out them realising how it even happened. some strong messages in this film that many teenagers need to watch. Having watched it again some years later, It has dated slightly in time but not only Leo is outstanding but Mark Whalberg shows that he too was showing potential back then 15 years ago or so. I have never been too sure of Whalberg in the past sometimes mixing natural acting ability in movies such as 'the fighter' or his interesting performance of the character police detective 'dignam' in the departed with shocking performances such as 'the happening or Planet of the Apes (where to be honest I don't blame him but the directors for poor casting). But Wharlberg in this movie shows genuine class, perhaps portraying a young man who had an adolecence pretty similar to his diaries character 'mickey'. on a whole the film is a class act and hidden gem. A must see.

    I thought "The Basketball Diaries" was a really good book, but this particular screen translation was bungled. Though a diary, the book is surprisingly well-written considering the author wrote it in his early teens, and it provides a great deal of insight into the world of Irish-Catholic youth in New York City during the 1960's. It's all real, but it reads like a good novel (I honestly liked it a lot more than "The Catcher in the Rye," and even "Junkie" by William S. Burroughs). It is also incredibly graphic, particularly in how it deals with Carroll prostituting himself to support his heroin addiction. I can't think of a single novel written by an adult about teenage life that has balls like that. The problem with the movie is that it totally misses the point of the book. Since Carroll is writing about himself, the book is completely non-judgemental. It simply documents the events. The movie, on the other hand, is like the after-school special version of the book. DiCaprio's character tries heroin, and in the very next scene, he's a filthy bum living in an alleyway. No insight is provided into heroin addiction at all; it's simply more Reagan-era "Just say no" religious crap. The ending in the book is also much bleaker than the ending in the film, which actually ends about 2/3rds of the way through the book, if I remember correctly. I do think the actors in the film were all terrific, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives a surprisingly mature performance. Ernie Hudson was also great, and the photography was gorgeous. But the movie itself just sucks. Read the book instead.

    Ever since hearing the commentary track of Paul Thomas Anderson for the Boogie Nights DVD (I heard it like in early 2008), this title, Scott Kalvert's The Basketball Diaries, came to stay in my mind. I really love the way P.T. Anderson, like Tarantino or now Edgar Wright, talks about his influences, about film in general, and in this case after hearing that he cast Mark Walhberg after seeing his performance in The Basketball Diaries ("god, he was good, god, I though he was so good" Â– and Mark made sure P.T. Anderson wanted him for his acting and not for his body!) definitely made me want to check it out (I Am Cuba is another of the titles that stayed with me thanks to that commentary. I still have to watch it tough). And P.T. Anderson explains that actually his first choice for that part was Leonardo DiCaprio. He doesn't specify, but it's very probable that DiCaprio became his choice also due to The Basketball Diaries (however he decided to do Titanic instead). Anyway, there is not a R4 DVD around that I know, so it was until some weeks ago, when I found on ebay a really cheap R1 DVD of it, when I sort of recall everything and finally got it. When you see a movie with the title of "The Basketball Diaries" and a very young DiCaprio, I mean, a young blonde kid in school clothes in its DVD cover you may not think of it as something really interesting. Definitely you don't think of it as a strong movie about the consequences of drug addiction. This is a movie that deals with the downfall of some very talented young basketball players. It has few to offer for those seeking for a straight sports movie though. We learn that our characters really can play basketball, and pretty much that's it. This is really a straight drug movie. And it's a really good one even though it doesn't really add something "brand-new" to the drug movie sort of formula (but we probably have here the basketball game with the most doped players. That scene features the Doors' "Riders on the Storm", which is pretty cool indeed). My sort of analogy goes with the thing that DiCaprio became like a different actor once he began working with Martin Scorsese back in 2002. He definitely left Titanic behind. Maybe before Scorsese but hell, since Gangs of New York I, at least, see a different DiCaprio. So here in The Basketball Diaries we have like the two DiCaprio. The movie at first sight is a coming of age one with the Titanic DiCaprio suffering the type of education that his Catholic school gives but also having fun with his friends (all are part of a great Catholic basketball team that is pretty much invincible) and stuff; it's a "kids being kids" kind of story. Once the movie gets much darker we get to see the Scorsese DiCaprio. Somehow some scenes really make see the very intense DiCaprio from the Scorsese films. It was a surprise to have him here doing something like that, two years before Titanic (I have yet to see What's Eating Gilbert Grape, for which he earned his first Oscar nomination back in 1994). This is worth watching stuff.

    Based on the autobiographical novel written by Jim Carroll, The Basketball Diaries follows one young man's descent into addiction, crime and homelessness. Jim (here played with mature dedication by Leonardo Di Caprio) is a promising high school basketball player, who along with his three friends, enjoy shooting hoops and getting into general mischief. What starts out as a past-time, soon deteriorates into something more deprived and desperate, as Jim sees his world crash around him as his drug habit becomes an unstoppable affliction. When Jim's situation gets so desperate that he leaves home to hustle and rob on the streets, he begins to push away the people in his life that were once close to him. His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, throws him out after the extremities of his situation become apparent to her and refuses him back. Reggie (Ernie Hudson) was an inspirational figure and mentor to Jim and regularly met up to play basketball in the court. And Neutron (Patrick McGaw) distances himself from Jim and his friends' habits and focuses on his basketball career, much to Jim's dismay. These people will all have a profound effect on Jim's eventual redemption. The film also switches the book's real-life setting from 1960's New York to the 90's. What The Basketball Diaries attempts to do is to create a realistic and gritty (a phrase that seems to be thrown around a lot these days) depiction of drug abuse, and create a hellish portrait of a confused young man who his throwing away his many talents in favour of a life that is doing nothing but ruining his life and isolating the people around him. In reality, this is a terribly-directed film that seems to sledgehammer the phrase 'drugs are bad' into the viewers skull, rather than having the nerve, or in deed the respect, to let the audience make their own mind up. Or maybe the director doesn't have the skill to create a film capable of conjuring up those feelings in the viewer. It sounds ridiculous, but if you have seen the South Park episode where Mr Mackey is giving his anti-drug lecture by simply listing the drugs that are 'bad', then you can see a clear parallel to this film. Jim basically goes from one drug to the other and one crime to the next. It's not interesting, convincing, and to be honest I found it all just very annoying. Jim is a character of no redeeming qualities. He's selfish, careless, and is basically a whiny little kid. Fair enough, this is a chance to develop an interesting, fully-rounded character, but director Scott Kalvert and scriptwriter Bryan Goluboff cannot combine their 'skills' to pull it off. Even though Jim narrates the film and reveals everything about his feelings and opinions, and Di Caprio's fantastic performance, we never get inside Jim's head enough to understand him and why he is willing to give up on a fledging basketball career. This is a character that we're supposed to be praying for to overcome his addiction, but (spoilers!) when his clean-break arrived, I asked myself should I be feeling happy for this arsehole? A well-acted film all-round, namely from the lead and Mark Wahlberg as his friend Mickey, but a film that is swamped in faults and scenes that are just ridiculous. Possibly only remotely remembered for the controversial scene where Jim storms his school with a shotgun in a drug-addled fantasy, which was caught up in the media storm surrounding the Columbine High School massacre. Watch only for signs of early promise from Di Caprio, but otherwise avoid. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com
