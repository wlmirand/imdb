    Truck filled with explosives accidentally explode collapsing a NY tunnel. This is a disaster movie. It's got all the stupidity that comes with it. But even by that standard, this isn't a good example of the genre. Sylvester Stallone is a some kind of disaster planner Kit Latura. Of course he charges in to help get everybody out. And everybody thinks little of him. For some reason, all the people in charge are always wrong. People are too annoying. Everybody is screaming yelling arguing. It's all testosterone. Instead of real emotions, we get overacting. Sly isn't much better. But all the ridiculous machismo really makes Sly almost tame and reasonable.

    Director Rob Cohen is considered by most critics to produce average to slightly above average films. Majority of these opinions are based on who's starring in them. The Fast and the Furious (2001), xXx (2002) & The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008) all were popular at the box office at the time because of who the main lead was. This is no different here. It's no surprise that because Stallone is the main lead that many people decided to go see this movie at the time. In this "disaster" genre film, Sylvester Stallone plays an ordinary man, Kit Latura, who looks straight into the face of death in order to save some survivors when an explosion goes off in an underwater highway tunnel and ends up having both ends sealed off with no escape. Along with Stallone are a few other well-known actors like Chief Frank Kraft (Dan Hedaya) and wealthy businessman Roy Nord (Viggo Mortensen). Even Stallone's son, Sage, plays a smaller role as a convict. Do any of these characters stand out - no not much. If there's any character to really root for, it would be Mortensen's character. Mortensen gave his character a charm none of the others seemed to know how to make. Perhaps because Mortensen just looked at the situation in a whole different way. Compare that to Stallone's performance and it seems like Mortensen should have been the main lead. But if there's one thing that this movie got right, it was the tension. Holy cow was this movie packed with tension! There was not one moment where it felt that no one would make it out. Quite honestly, I don't blame the actors for half their reactions to this situation. If any of us viewers were in their shoes, the majority of us would be freaking out too. It really does feel like a lose-lose situation. Unfortunately, this is another reason why it doesn't entertain as good as it should though. The atmosphere was way too depressing. Not one character (except Viggo Mortensen's character) had one shred of a positive outlook. Not even Stallone's character had one, which kind of shocked me. I'm not sure if Stallone's character was written like that, to make him seem more human but you can still make a character human even if he faces adversity with a confident outlook. But that wasn't visible here. But I assume this is due to the screenwriter, Leslie Bohem, whom according to her pre-writings and post work display that her writing capabilities really need to be assessed more. On the side, Randy Edelman's score to the film was proficient in its work like most of his other productions. What amazed me though is that I enjoyed the music but I also didn't appreciate of how it didn't pick up in tone. It consistently felt depressing. I think Edelman put in a little too much emotion this time (even if it was effective). Finally, the special effects and set designs were probably the most astounding because of how real the situation felt and looked. The scene I was the most nervous about was when Stallone was going through a timed sequence of fan blades...yikes...talk about gut wrenching. But hey, according to Stallone, that's why he took on this project because he wanted to concur his fear of close quarters. Good for him, I'll assume many of us regular people and including myself would not be so eager to go jumping into such problems. As a whole, it works at increasing the tension to a high level along with effective music but sadly it also encourages the characters to be depressing and unlikable. It's close to start being a disaster.

    A bunch of people are trapped in a tunnel underwater when a toxic waste fire manages to block both ends! Good thing that Kit Latura (Sylvester Stallone) is there to help them. I don't disagree that this movie is utterly predictable. All the stock characters are in place (the elderly couple; the teenagers; the dysfunctional family; a policeman) and we have the square-jawed hero to save them. So I knew what was coming every step of the way...but I didn't care. It's VERY well-done! They have a good script that moves fast, top character actors in the minor roles (even Claire Bloom is there!), nonstop action, GREAT special effects, plenty of explosions and some incredible stunt work. Also (for once) the comedy in a film like this that is actually funny:) This was just dismissed as just another stupid Stallone film which is too bad because it's very good. If you're an action film fan u have to see this. Recommended.

    Daylight is a disaster film that stars Sylvester Stallone together with Amy Brenneman, Viggo Mortensen, Dan Hedaya, and Danielle Harris.This echo of 1970s disaster flicks that tells a story of Kit Latura,a disgraced former head of New York City's Emergency Medical Services, a loser who is nevertheless a compulsive rescuer of people in danger.It was directed by Rob Cohen. A truck containing dangerous chemicals explodes in the Holland Tunnel, trapping those New Yorkers not killed in the explosion. Authorities know there are survivors, but cannot figure out what to do to save them. Ruptured water mains and leaks in the tunnel itself, which is beneath the Hudson River, will cause it to fill with water in a few hours. Of all the colorful characters trapped there, only Roy Nord, a mountain climber, has any ideas about what to do, but he quickly dies while attempting to save the others. However, Kit Latura is a former city Emergency Medical Services director who was in the area of the explosion, and he knows the tunnel's construction quirks. He quickly convinces city officials to let him wend his way through the tunnel's maze of exhaust fans to help the exhausted survivors confront the obstacles that await them. This has Stallone as a miscast who outrageously pushes the envelope of his martyr persona to near-religious levels. He throws himself, quite literally, into this part, and between that entertainment factor and the unnervingly convincing effects.Nevertheless,it is a pretty watchable film.

    I am not much into movies where people have to fight natural or man-caused accidents or animals, I prefer good against deliberate evil. Race with time to save people is high-minded, but there is no force to create or fulfill more obstacles. It may be exciting to watch ordinary people overcome themselves, but physical phenomena do not plan their consequences, things just happen due to laws of nature. Such a movie should undoubtedly have some fixed points, but Daylight has too many of them, resulting with less turning points and surprises and a number of unrealistic scenes and episodes. I do like e.g. John McLaine or Dirty Harry much more than Kit Latura. And I have become picky seeing cast representing all different genders-races-backgrounds-ages, moody survivors, moments of self-delusion, ordinary people becoming rescuing heroes...

    Possibly the most insufferably tedious Sylvester Stallone movie ever made, which is no mean feat. The star made a dozen movies during the 90s, and if he was guilty of some bad decisions in the 1980s, then it was nothing compared to what came in the following decade. First we had Rocky inexplicably growing back his Philly accent in a fourth sequel that even Stallone now rejects; two comedies which, like Rocky V, are probably better than their rep but still quite weak; and the usual line of unchallenging action movies that are below his level. Out of them, from 1990-1996 only Demolition Man emerges with any credit; an action movie as mindless as the rest, but not one without a sense of fun or watchability. It's not that there's anything particularly wrong with mindless action movies, more that such roles only use one part of the acting spectrum. Fine for the likes of Van Damme and Swarzenegger, but when you're able to co-star with DeNiro and Harvey Kietel without disgracing yourself (as Stallone did just the following year in the underrated Cop Land) then it's something of a waste. Stallone saw out the decade with the rewarding animated feature Antz, delivering two of his best pictures back-to-back, just when it seemed all over for any qualitative worth. Immediately following this he fell back into dross, before resuscitating his career in the mid 2000s with decent Rocky and Rambo sequels. It seems the guy really doesn't know what's good for him. As for Daylight, then it does, to be fair to it, deliver on its promise. A disaster movie under a collapsed subway system, said disaster happens well within twenty minutes of the film's commencement, giving us another 90m to endure Stallone gurning around and lots of ciphers shouting at one another. Such a short pre-disaster time may suggest that the characters involved are severely underdeveloped and we never get to know or care about who they are. But just look at that title quote. Someone is called upon to actually say those words. You couldn't blame them if they were glad the dialogue was on the low side, could you?

    Most of the time the enjoyment value in a Sly Stallone film can be astutely judged by the trailer. If he appears with his shirt off (Rambo / Rocky / The Expendables) your juvenile entertainment value is all but assured. If he somehow manages to keep his shirt on (Judge Dredd / Rhinestone / Stop! Or my Mom will shoot etc) things generally don't go so well. In Daylight Stallone keeps his shirt on. Despite this though he manages to find a companion piece to Cop Land in the little known field of 'shirt-on successes'. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Some naughty guys manage to cause a massive explosion in the New York  New Jersey tunnel, simultaneously blocking both ends and leaving the precious few survivors cold, wet and rapidly running out of options. Unfortunately the explosion was 15 or so years too early to prevent the escape of the Jersey Shore and Jerseylicious idiots, but you can't have everything. (Nothing to do with the plot but the actual explosion and subsequent fireworks is awesomely pulled off, I'm not sure if it was miniatures or 90s CGI, I only know I wished for a Blu-Ray instead of the DVD I rented.) Enter Sly Stallone as Kit Latura, who until moments before was merely another New York Cab Driver who didn't speak English. Using skills gleaned from a previous career  that we hear of throughout the film  Kit manages to save many victims in the tunnel exterior before promptly deciding he is the only man capable saving those still trapped inside. And whaddya know he's right. After another tension filled scene Kit finds himself inside and meets the usual motley crew of huddled desperates, with the added spice being provided by the inclusion of a few hardened prisoners that were in transit before the explosion. Among the others are a middle class family, some retirees, a tunnel worker, a genuine high rolling thrill seeker, and of course even a damsel for Kit to save and bond with (Amy Brenneman). From here it is all Hollywood; Kit must cajole and caress the survivors through a series of ever-increasing dangers and perils, with new causes of premature death only seconds behind at all times. There is a direct correlation between how cocky / dangerous you are and your likelihood of living, and of course some good people must be sacrificed in the name of viewer empathy. There's even a dog and a kid for the more hardened viewers out there. Will this sneaky manipulative emotional blackmail ever end? These cumulative dozen or so people, all of who rely solely on Kit to save them from almost certain death by an ever-increasing range of threats, are alternately indignant, ungrateful, defeated, elated, helpful and supportive, depending on the needs of the film at the time. The strange thing is that we've seen it all before  many times  Outbreak came out the year before and tried all the same tricks. But with this film there are 25 examples of 'just when you think it can't get any worse' and somehow they all work. Sure it ain't a Picasso, but strike me if it isn't a tension filled thrill ride (that's at least what the promo poster might say  but it is!). When I plugged in the DVD and settled back I was hoping for little more than a couple hours of time killing. While future viewings might deaden my support I quite enjoyed watching Daylight, which in itself guarantees there will at least be one more viewing at some point in the future. Having avoided Outbreak deliberately for a decade and a half I only wish I could say the same for that monkey-virus drivel. Final Rating  7.5 / 10. Hollywood formula all the way to the bank. The enjoyment bank. (Last The Simpsons joke rip-off for at least 24 hours, I promise.)

    Stallone's one and only disaster film is perfect popcorn entertainment. Like the great disaster films of yore, there are fun parts in the supporting cast, regarding those trapped in a tunnel to New Jersey after a "toxic explosion", with former EMS Chief Stallone trying to lead them out of harm's way as numerous hurdles present themselves causing one terrible situation after another, sacrifices made, courage needed by all if they are to survive. Sure the music telegraphs and manipulates the audience telling us when we are to gasp, to cry, to cheer, but Daylight really establishes just the kind of movie star Stallone is. Battling the elements, like cold water, collapsing debris from with inside the tunnel, constant explosions and quakes, heroism and suspense are in great supply. This movie is designed to toy with your emotions as most disaster movies, infighting and outbursts, death and the proposition of death, trying to find a way out when all hope seems lost, and the rescue of a trapped policeman, caught under a car, as well as, having to accept loss and regretting decisions made when no other options seemed availableDaylight provokes response from the viewer in a way disaster movies often do. Stallone has a demanding role, especially asking of his physicality, including scenes where he must incite belief from the bickering multitude of survivors to keep the faith even when events transpiring seem to indicate certain doom. Cast includes Amy Brenneman (who has a harrowing scene involving a loose cable shooting off electrical sparks), Viggo Mortensen (as a cocky climber celebrity who oozes charisma, but his confidence gets the best of him despite Stallone's warnings to leave a dangerous area certain to avalanche), Dan Hedaya (as Stallone's superior who triggered his firing), Jay O Sanders, Karen Young, and Danielle Harris (as a family under tumult), Claire Bloom (The Haunting) and Colin Fox (as an elderly couple still mourning the loss of their son), and Stan Shaw as George, the policeman who has a gut-wrenching emotional scene where his fate is sealed, causing Stallone to make a devastating choice. There are other characters like prisoners from a bus carrying them, and the various people involved in trying to find a way to get the trapped out of their predicament. Built as a roller-coaster, edge-of-your-seat entertainment, and succeeds, I believe. One of Stallone's more unappreciated 90s films, along with "Cop Land" and "Assassins". As what occurs in other disaster pictures, there are casualties, not surprising considering the situation itself.

    Non-stop action with little lead in or lag, this is one of the best low budget (only $80 million to make) action films in the Stallone arsenal. The first 15 minutes of the film is lead in, and only as much character development as we need. Amy Brenneman (Judging Amy, Heat) is a disgruntled screen writer who has had it with New York. Jay O. Sanders and Karen Young, along with daughter Danielle Harris, are a dysfunctional family recovering from a separation. Throw in a bus load of Juvenile offenders in a Corrections bus (among them Sage Stallone and Renoly Santiago), a tunnel guard (Stan Shaw) with romantic attachments to a safety observer (Vanessa Bell Calloway), a hot shot extreme sports hero (Viggo Mortensen) trying to make a publicity coup out of the situation, and elderly couple with their dog, and you have the makings of a film with plenty of angst, drama, paranoia and panic. Stallone plays Kit Latura, formerly the head of the EMS division who was fired a few years back when he lost people in a tunnel explosion and collapse. He is a man of principles who immediately assumes personal responsibility for rescuing the survivors. He risks his life to reach them and works with difficulty to keep them together and alive. When the City Engineers begin to dig out the tunnel, allowing the pressure that is keeping the water from rising, he must find a way to keep them alive while trying to decide how to escape. Rated R for death and destruction, this edge of your seat drama has plenty of fine performances to keep the viewers interested. Collectible is a coin toss. If you are a Stallone fan or you like good action films, you might want this one on the shelf.

    I suppose I might be only slightly biased given that Sylvester Stallone is one of my favorite Hollywood stars. No one nails action like Stallone and this was during his prime to say the least. The thing I love about Daylight is that it isn't your run of the mill action flick because at its heart its really a disaster movie and all about survival with a group of very diverse and captivating people. Stallone is clearly the hero and he just draws you into the story. Many might say the man can't act but this film shows just how great his on screen charisma is. The special effects are terrific, the original disaster that seals the tunnel is breath taking and will put you on the edge of your seat. The films only shortcoming might be that it does not really bring anything new or unique to the disaster genre and often becomes predictable as well. The cast are all terrific and play terrific supporting characters to Stallone. Amy Brenneman is solid as the female lead in the film and her and Stallone actually have very good chemistry. Viggo Mortensen who is a terrific actor actually proves he can also be a supporting actor as well and he is great as the fearless adventurer. Colin Fox and Claire Bloom are outstanding as the senior couple fighting to survive. Character actor Jay Sanders is great as the father who will stop at nothing to save his family. Even Sage Stallone (Sly's real life son) does a great job playing opposite his Dad. Director Rob Cohen has been in the industry for decades and has written produced and directed and he clearly has a handle on what entertains. No one will ever tell you Daylight is a brilliant piece of film making, its not even the most entertaining thing you'll ever see but is it good? Yes! and does it entertain? Absolutely! Everyone can enjoy this film because it has a great story, and might seem typical for a disaster flick but if that's your genre then you won't want to miss this movie because this is a 90's classic!! 8/10

Race with time to save people is high-minded, but there is no force to create or fulfill more obstacles. It may be exciting to watch ordinary people overcome themselves, but physical phenomena do not plan their consequences, things just happen due to laws of nature. Such a movie should undoubtedly have some fixed points, but Daylight has too many of them, resulting with less turning points and surprises and a number of unrealistic scenes and episodes. I do like e.g. John McLaine or Dirty Harry much more than Kit Latura. And I have become picky seeing cast representing all different genders-races-backgrounds-ages, moody survivors, moments of self-delusion, ordinary people becoming rescuing heroes...

    Possibly the most insufferably tedious Sylvester Stallone movie ever made, which is no mean feat. The star made a dozen movies during the 90s, and if he was guilty of some bad decisions in the 1980s, then it was nothing compared to what came in the following decade. First we had Rocky inexplicably growing back his Philly accent in a fourth sequel that even Stallone now rejects; two comedies which, like Rocky V, are probably better than their rep but still quite weak; and the usual line of unchallenging action movies that are below his level. Out of them, from 1990-1996 only Demolition Man emerges with any credit; an action movie as mindless as the rest, but not one without a sense of fun or watchability. It's not that there's anything particularly wrong with mindless action movies, more that such roles only use one part of the acting spectrum. Fine for the likes of Van Damme and Swarzenegger, but when you're able to co-star with DeNiro and Harvey Kietel without disgracing yourself (as Stallone did just the following year in the underrated Cop Land) then it's something of a waste. Stallone saw out the decade with the rewarding animated feature Antz, delivering two of his best pictures back-to-back, just when it seemed all over for any qualitative worth. Immediately following this he fell back into dross, before resuscitating his career in the mid 2000s with decent Rocky and Rambo sequels. It seems the guy really doesn't know what's good for him. As for Daylight, then it does, to be fair to it, deliver on its promise. A disaster movie under a collapsed subway system, said disaster happens well within twenty minutes of the film's commencement, giving us another 90m to endure Stallone gurning around and lots of ciphers shouting at one another. Such a short pre-disaster time may suggest that the characters involved are severely underdeveloped and we never get to know or care about who they are. But just look at that title quote. Someone is called upon to actually say those words. You couldn't blame them if they were glad the dialogue was on the low side, could you?

    Most of the time the enjoyment value in a Sly Stallone film can be astutely judged by the trailer. If he appears with his shirt off (Rambo / Rocky / The Expendables) your juvenile entertainment value is all but assured. If he somehow manages to keep his shirt on (Judge Dredd / Rhinestone / Stop! Or my Mom will shoot etc) things generally don't go so well. In Daylight Stallone keeps his shirt on. Despite this though he manages to find a companion piece to Cop Land in the little known field of 'shirt-on successes'. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Some naughty guys manage to cause a massive explosion in the New York  New Jersey tunnel, simultaneously blocking both ends and leaving the precious few survivors cold, wet and rapidly running out of options. Unfortunately the explosion was 15 or so years too early to prevent the escape of the Jersey Shore and Jerseylicious idiots, but you can't have everything. (Nothing to do with the plot but the actual explosion and subsequent fireworks is awesomely pulled off, I'm not sure if it was miniatures or 90s CGI, I only know I wished for a Blu-Ray instead of the DVD I rented.) Enter Sly Stallone as Kit Latura, who until moments before was merely another New York Cab Driver who didn't speak English. Using skills gleaned from a previous career  that we hear of throughout the film  Kit manages to save many victims in the tunnel exterior before promptly deciding he is the only man capable saving those still trapped inside. And whaddya know he's right. After another tension filled scene Kit finds himself inside and meets the usual motley crew of huddled desperates, with the added spice being provided by the inclusion of a few hardened prisoners that were in transit before the explosion. Among the others are a middle class family, some retirees, a tunnel worker, a genuine high rolling thrill seeker, and of course even a damsel for Kit to save and bond with (Amy Brenneman). From here it is all Hollywood; Kit must cajole and caress the survivors through a series of ever-increasing dangers and perils, with new causes of premature death only seconds behind at all times. There is a direct correlation between how cocky / dangerous you are and your likelihood of living, and of course some good people must be sacrificed in the name of viewer empathy. There's even a dog and a kid for the more hardened viewers out there. Will this sneaky manipulative emotional blackmail ever end? These cumulative dozen or so people, all of who rely solely on Kit to save them from almost certain death by an ever-increasing range of threats, are alternately indignant, ungrateful, defeated, elated, helpful and supportive, depending on the needs of the film at the time. The strange thing is that we've seen it all before  many times  Outbreak came out the year before and tried all the same tricks. But with this film there are 25 examples of 'just when you think it can't get any worse' and somehow they all work. Sure it ain't a Picasso, but strike me if it isn't a tension filled thrill ride (that's at least what the promo poster might say  but it is!). When I plugged in the DVD and settled back I was hoping for little more than a couple hours of time killing. While future viewings might deaden my support I quite enjoyed watching Daylight, which in itself guarantees there will at least be one more viewing at some point in the future. Having avoided Outbreak deliberately for a decade and a half I only wish I could say the same for that monkey-virus drivel. Final Rating  7.5 / 10. Hollywood formula all the way to the bank. The enjoyment bank. (Last The Simpsons joke rip-off for at least 24 hours, I promise.)

    Stallone's one and only disaster film is perfect popcorn entertainment. Like the great disaster films of yore, there are fun parts in the supporting cast, regarding those trapped in a tunnel to New Jersey after a "toxic explosion", with former EMS Chief Stallone trying to lead them out of harm's way as numerous hurdles present themselves causing one terrible situation after another, sacrifices made, courage needed by all if they are to survive. Sure the music telegraphs and manipulates the audience telling us when we are to gasp, to cry, to cheer, but Daylight really establishes just the kind of movie star Stallone is. Battling the elements, like cold water, collapsing debris from with inside the tunnel, constant explosions and quakes, heroism and suspense are in great supply. This movie is designed to toy with your emotions as most disaster movies, infighting and outbursts, death and the proposition of death, trying to find a way out when all hope seems lost, and the rescue of a trapped policeman, caught under a car, as well as, having to accept loss and regretting decisions made when no other options seemed availableDaylight provokes response from the viewer in a way disaster movies often do. Stallone has a demanding role, especially asking of his physicality, including scenes where he must incite belief from the bickering multitude of survivors to keep the faith even when events transpiring seem to indicate certain doom. Cast includes Amy Brenneman (who has a harrowing scene involving a loose cable shooting off electrical sparks), Viggo Mortensen (as a cocky climber celebrity who oozes charisma, but his confidence gets the best of him despite Stallone's warnings to leave a dangerous area certain to avalanche), Dan Hedaya (as Stallone's superior who triggered his firing), Jay O Sanders, Karen Young, and Danielle Harris (as a family under tumult), Claire Bloom (The Haunting) and Colin Fox (as an elderly couple still mourning the loss of their son), and Stan Shaw as George, the policeman who has a gut-wrenching emotional scene where his fate is sealed, causing Stallone to make a devastating choice. There are other characters like prisoners from a bus carrying them, and the various people involved in trying to find a way to get the trapped out of their predicament. Built as a roller-coaster, edge-of-your-seat entertainment, and succeeds, I believe. One of Stallone's more unappreciated 90s films, along with "Cop Land" and "Assassins". As what occurs in other disaster pictures, there are casualties, not surprising considering the situation itself.

    Non-stop action with little lead in or lag, this is one of the best low budget (only $80 million to make) action films in the Stallone arsenal. The first 15 minutes of the film is lead in, and only as much character development as we need. Amy Brenneman (Judging Amy, Heat) is a disgruntled screen writer who has had it with New York. Jay O. Sanders and Karen Young, along with daughter Danielle Harris, are a dysfunctional family recovering from a separation. Throw in a bus load of Juvenile offenders in a Corrections bus (among them Sage Stallone and Renoly Santiago), a tunnel guard (Stan Shaw) with romantic attachments to a safety observer (Vanessa Bell Calloway), a hot shot extreme sports hero (Viggo Mortensen) trying to make a publicity coup out of the situation, and elderly couple with their dog, and you have the makings of a film with plenty of angst, drama, paranoia and panic. Stallone plays Kit Latura, formerly the head of the EMS division who was fired a few years back when he lost people in a tunnel explosion and collapse. He is a man of principles who immediately assumes personal responsibility for rescuing the survivors. He risks his life to reach them and works with difficulty to keep them together and alive. When the City Engineers begin to dig out the tunnel, allowing the pressure that is keeping the water from rising, he must find a way to keep them alive while trying to decide how to escape. Rated R for death and destruction, this edge of your seat drama has plenty of fine performances to keep the viewers interested. Collectible is a coin toss. If you are a Stallone fan or you like good action films, you might want this one on the shelf.

    I suppose I might be only slightly biased given that Sylvester Stallone is one of my favorite Hollywood stars. No one nails action like Stallone and this was during his prime to say the least. The thing I love about Daylight is that it isn't your run of the mill action flick because at its heart its really a disaster movie and all about survival with a group of very diverse and captivating people. Stallone is clearly the hero and he just draws you into the story. Many might say the man can't act but this film shows just how great his on screen charisma is. The special effects are terrific, the original disaster that seals the tunnel is breath taking and will put you on the edge of your seat. The films only shortcoming might be that it does not really bring anything new or unique to the disaster genre and often becomes predictable as well. The cast are all terrific and play terrific supporting characters to Stallone. Amy Brenneman is solid as the female lead in the film and her and Stallone actually have very good chemistry. Viggo Mortensen who is a terrific actor actually proves he can also be a supporting actor as well and he is great as the fearless adventurer. Colin Fox and Claire Bloom are outstanding as the senior couple fighting to survive. Character actor Jay Sanders is great as the father who will stop at nothing to save his family. Even Sage Stallone (Sly's real life son) does a great job playing opposite his Dad. Director Rob Cohen has been in the industry for decades and has written produced and directed and he clearly has a handle on what entertains. No one will ever tell you Daylight is a brilliant piece of film making, its not even the most entertaining thing you'll ever see but is it good? Yes! and does it entertain? Absolutely! Everyone can enjoy this film because it has a great story, and might seem typical for a disaster flick but if that's your genre then you won't want to miss this movie because this is a 90's classic!! 8/10

    Truck filled with explosives accidentally explode collapsing a NY tunnel. This is a disaster movie. It's got all the stupidity that comes with it. But even by that standard, this isn't a good example of the genre. Sylvester Stallone is a some kind of disaster planner Kit Latura. Of course he charges in to help get everybody out. And everybody thinks little of him. For some reason, all the people in charge are always wrong. People are too annoying. Everybody is screaming yelling arguing. It's all testosterone. Instead of real emotions, we get overacting. Sly isn't much better. But all the ridiculous machismo really makes Sly almost tame and reasonable.

    Director Rob Cohen is considered by most critics to produce average to slightly above average films. Majority of these opinions are based on who's starring in them. The Fast and the Furious (2001), xXx (2002) & The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008) all were popular at the box office at the time because of who the main lead was. This is no different here. It's no surprise that because Stallone is the main lead that many people decided to go see this movie at the time. In this "disaster" genre film, Sylvester Stallone plays an ordinary man, Kit Latura, who looks straight into the face of death in order to save some survivors when an explosion goes off in an underwater highway tunnel and ends up having both ends sealed off with no escape. Along with Stallone are a few other well-known actors like Chief Frank Kraft (Dan Hedaya) and wealthy businessman Roy Nord (Viggo Mortensen). Even Stallone's son, Sage, plays a smaller role as a convict. Do any of these characters stand out - no not much. If there's any character to really root for, it would be Mortensen's character. Mortensen gave his character a charm none of the others seemed to know how to make. Perhaps because Mortensen just looked at the situation in a whole different way. Compare that to Stallone's performance and it seems like Mortensen should have been the main lead. But if there's one thing that this movie got right, it was the tension. Holy cow was this movie packed with tension! There was not one moment where it felt that no one would make it out. Quite honestly, I don't blame the actors for half their reactions to this situation. If any of us viewers were in their shoes, the majority of us would be freaking out too. It really does feel like a lose-lose situation. Unfortunately, this is another reason why it doesn't entertain as good as it should though. The atmosphere was way too depressing. Not one character (except Viggo Mortensen's character) had one shred of a positive outlook. Not even Stallone's character had one, which kind of shocked me. I'm not sure if Stallone's character was written like that, to make him seem more human but you can still make a character human even if he faces adversity with a confident outlook. But that wasn't visible here. But I assume this is due to the screenwriter, Leslie Bohem, whom according to her pre-writings and post work display that her writing capabilities really need to be assessed more. On the side, Randy Edelman's score to the film was proficient in its work like most of his other productions. What amazed me though is that I enjoyed the music but I also didn't appreciate of how it didn't pick up in tone. It consistently felt depressing. I think Edelman put in a little too much emotion this time (even if it was effective). Finally, the special effects and set designs were probably the most astounding because of how real the situation felt and looked. The scene I was the most nervous about was when Stallone was going through a timed sequence of fan blades...yikes...talk about gut wrenching. But hey, according to Stallone, that's why he took on this project because he wanted to concur his fear of close quarters. Good for him, I'll assume many of us regular people and including myself would not be so eager to go jumping into such problems. As a whole, it works at increasing the tension to a high level along with effective music but sadly it also encourages the characters to be depressing and unlikable. It's close to start being a disaster.

    A bunch of people are trapped in a tunnel underwater when a toxic waste fire manages to block both ends! Good thing that Kit Latura (Sylvester Stallone) is there to help them. I don't disagree that this movie is utterly predictable. All the stock characters are in place (the elderly couple; the teenagers; the dysfunctional family; a policeman) and we have the square-jawed hero to save them. So I knew what was coming every step of the way...but I didn't care. It's VERY well-done! They have a good script that moves fast, top character actors in the minor roles (even Claire Bloom is there!), nonstop action, GREAT special effects, plenty of explosions and some incredible stunt work. Also (for once) the comedy in a film like this that is actually funny:) This was just dismissed as just another stupid Stallone film which is too bad because it's very good. If you're an action film fan u have to see this. Recommended.

    Daylight is a disaster film that stars Sylvester Stallone together with Amy Brenneman, Viggo Mortensen, Dan Hedaya, and Danielle Harris.This echo of 1970s disaster flicks that tells a story of Kit Latura,a disgraced former head of New York City's Emergency Medical Services, a loser who is nevertheless a compulsive rescuer of people in danger.It was directed by Rob Cohen. A truck containing dangerous chemicals explodes in the Holland Tunnel, trapping those New Yorkers not killed in the explosion. Authorities know there are survivors, but cannot figure out what to do to save them. Ruptured water mains and leaks in the tunnel itself, which is beneath the Hudson River, will cause it to fill with water in a few hours. Of all the colorful characters trapped there, only Roy Nord, a mountain climber, has any ideas about what to do, but he quickly dies while attempting to save the others. However, Kit Latura is a former city Emergency Medical Services director who was in the area of the explosion, and he knows the tunnel's construction quirks. He quickly convinces city officials to let him wend his way through the tunnel's maze of exhaust fans to help the exhausted survivors confront the obstacles that await them. This has Stallone as a miscast who outrageously pushes the envelope of his martyr persona to near-religious levels. He throws himself, quite literally, into this part, and between that entertainment factor and the unnervingly convincing effects.Nevertheless,it is a pretty watchable film.

Sanders and Karen Young, along with daughter Danielle Harris, are a dysfunctional family recovering from a separation. Throw in a bus load of Juvenile offenders in a Corrections bus (among them Sage Stallone and Renoly Santiago), a tunnel guard (Stan Shaw) with romantic attachments to a safety observer (Vanessa Bell Calloway), a hot shot extreme sports hero (Viggo Mortensen) trying to make a publicity coup out of the situation, and elderly couple with their dog, and you have the makings of a film with plenty of angst, drama, paranoia and panic. Stallone plays Kit Latura, formerly the head of the EMS division who was fired a few years back when he lost people in a tunnel explosion and collapse. He is a man of principles who immediately assumes personal responsibility for rescuing the survivors. He risks his life to reach them and works with difficulty to keep them together and alive. When the City Engineers begin to dig out the tunnel, allowing the pressure that is keeping the water from rising, he must find a way to keep them alive while trying to decide how to escape. Rated R for death and destruction, this edge of your seat drama has plenty of fine performances to keep the viewers interested. Collectible is a coin toss. If you are a Stallone fan or you like good action films, you might want this one on the shelf.

    I suppose I might be only slightly biased given that Sylvester Stallone is one of my favorite Hollywood stars. No one nails action like Stallone and this was during his prime to say the least. The thing I love about Daylight is that it isn't your run of the mill action flick because at its heart its really a disaster movie and all about survival with a group of very diverse and captivating people. Stallone is clearly the hero and he just draws you into the story. Many might say the man can't act but this film shows just how great his on screen charisma is. The special effects are terrific, the original disaster that seals the tunnel is breath taking and will put you on the edge of your seat. The films only shortcoming might be that it does not really bring anything new or unique to the disaster genre and often becomes predictable as well. The cast are all terrific and play terrific supporting characters to Stallone. Amy Brenneman is solid as the female lead in the film and her and Stallone actually have very good chemistry. Viggo Mortensen who is a terrific actor actually proves he can also be a supporting actor as well and he is great as the fearless adventurer. Colin Fox and Claire Bloom are outstanding as the senior couple fighting to survive. Character actor Jay Sanders is great as the father who will stop at nothing to save his family. Even Sage Stallone (Sly's real life son) does a great job playing opposite his Dad. Director Rob Cohen has been in the industry for decades and has written produced and directed and he clearly has a handle on what entertains. No one will ever tell you Daylight is a brilliant piece of film making, its not even the most entertaining thing you'll ever see but is it good? Yes! and does it entertain? Absolutely! Everyone can enjoy this film because it has a great story, and might seem typical for a disaster flick but if that's your genre then you won't want to miss this movie because this is a 90's classic!! 8/10

    Truck filled with explosives accidentally explode collapsing a NY tunnel. This is a disaster movie. It's got all the stupidity that comes with it. But even by that standard, this isn't a good example of the genre. Sylvester Stallone is a some kind of disaster planner Kit Latura. Of course he charges in to help get everybody out. And everybody thinks little of him. For some reason, all the people in charge are always wrong. People are too annoying. Everybody is screaming yelling arguing. It's all testosterone. Instead of real emotions, we get overacting. Sly isn't much better. But all the ridiculous machismo really makes Sly almost tame and reasonable.

    Director Rob Cohen is considered by most critics to produce average to slightly above average films. Majority of these opinions are based on who's starring in them. The Fast and the Furious (2001), xXx (2002) & The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008) all were popular at the box office at the time because of who the main lead was. This is no different here. It's no surprise that because Stallone is the main lead that many people decided to go see this movie at the time. In this "disaster" genre film, Sylvester Stallone plays an ordinary man, Kit Latura, who looks straight into the face of death in order to save some survivors when an explosion goes off in an underwater highway tunnel and ends up having both ends sealed off with no escape. Along with Stallone are a few other well-known actors like Chief Frank Kraft (Dan Hedaya) and wealthy businessman Roy Nord (Viggo Mortensen). Even Stallone's son, Sage, plays a smaller role as a convict. Do any of these characters stand out - no not much. If there's any character to really root for, it would be Mortensen's character. Mortensen gave his character a charm none of the others seemed to know how to make. Perhaps because Mortensen just looked at the situation in a whole different way. Compare that to Stallone's performance and it seems like Mortensen should have been the main lead. But if there's one thing that this movie got right, it was the tension. Holy cow was this movie packed with tension! There was not one moment where it felt that no one would make it out. Quite honestly, I don't blame the actors for half their reactions to this situation. If any of us viewers were in their shoes, the majority of us would be freaking out too. It really does feel like a lose-lose situation. Unfortunately, this is another reason why it doesn't entertain as good as it should though. The atmosphere was way too depressing. Not one character (except Viggo Mortensen's character) had one shred of a positive outlook. Not even Stallone's character had one, which kind of shocked me. I'm not sure if Stallone's character was written like that, to make him seem more human but you can still make a character human even if he faces adversity with a confident outlook. But that wasn't visible here. But I assume this is due to the screenwriter, Leslie Bohem, whom according to her pre-writings and post work display that her writing capabilities really need to be assessed more. On the side, Randy Edelman's score to the film was proficient in its work like most of his other productions. What amazed me though is that I enjoyed the music but I also didn't appreciate of how it didn't pick up in tone. It consistently felt depressing. I think Edelman put in a little too much emotion this time (even if it was effective). Finally, the special effects and set designs were probably the most astounding because of how real the situation felt and looked. The scene I was the most nervous about was when Stallone was going through a timed sequence of fan blades...yikes...talk about gut wrenching. But hey, according to Stallone, that's why he took on this project because he wanted to concur his fear of close quarters. Good for him, I'll assume many of us regular people and including myself would not be so eager to go jumping into such problems. As a whole, it works at increasing the tension to a high level along with effective music but sadly it also encourages the characters to be depressing and unlikable. It's close to start being a disaster.

    A bunch of people are trapped in a tunnel underwater when a toxic waste fire manages to block both ends! Good thing that Kit Latura (Sylvester Stallone) is there to help them. I don't disagree that this movie is utterly predictable. All the stock characters are in place (the elderly couple; the teenagers; the dysfunctional family; a policeman) and we have the square-jawed hero to save them. So I knew what was coming every step of the way...but I didn't care. It's VERY well-done! They have a good script that moves fast, top character actors in the minor roles (even Claire Bloom is there!), nonstop action, GREAT special effects, plenty of explosions and some incredible stunt work. Also (for once) the comedy in a film like this that is actually funny:) This was just dismissed as just another stupid Stallone film which is too bad because it's very good. If you're an action film fan u have to see this. Recommended.

    Daylight is a disaster film that stars Sylvester Stallone together with Amy Brenneman, Viggo Mortensen, Dan Hedaya, and Danielle Harris.This echo of 1970s disaster flicks that tells a story of Kit Latura,a disgraced former head of New York City's Emergency Medical Services, a loser who is nevertheless a compulsive rescuer of people in danger.It was directed by Rob Cohen. A truck containing dangerous chemicals explodes in the Holland Tunnel, trapping those New Yorkers not killed in the explosion. Authorities know there are survivors, but cannot figure out what to do to save them. Ruptured water mains and leaks in the tunnel itself, which is beneath the Hudson River, will cause it to fill with water in a few hours. Of all the colorful characters trapped there, only Roy Nord, a mountain climber, has any ideas about what to do, but he quickly dies while attempting to save the others. However, Kit Latura is a former city Emergency Medical Services director who was in the area of the explosion, and he knows the tunnel's construction quirks. He quickly convinces city officials to let him wend his way through the tunnel's maze of exhaust fans to help the exhausted survivors confront the obstacles that await them. This has Stallone as a miscast who outrageously pushes the envelope of his martyr persona to near-religious levels. He throws himself, quite literally, into this part, and between that entertainment factor and the unnervingly convincing effects.Nevertheless,it is a pretty watchable film.

    I am not much into movies where people have to fight natural or man-caused accidents or animals, I prefer good against deliberate evil. Race with time to save people is high-minded, but there is no force to create or fulfill more obstacles. It may be exciting to watch ordinary people overcome themselves, but physical phenomena do not plan their consequences, things just happen due to laws of nature. Such a movie should undoubtedly have some fixed points, but Daylight has too many of them, resulting with less turning points and surprises and a number of unrealistic scenes and episodes. I do like e.g. John McLaine or Dirty Harry much more than Kit Latura. And I have become picky seeing cast representing all different genders-races-backgrounds-ages, moody survivors, moments of self-delusion, ordinary people becoming rescuing heroes...

    Possibly the most insufferably tedious Sylvester Stallone movie ever made, which is no mean feat. The star made a dozen movies during the 90s, and if he was guilty of some bad decisions in the 1980s, then it was nothing compared to what came in the following decade. First we had Rocky inexplicably growing back his Philly accent in a fourth sequel that even Stallone now rejects; two comedies which, like Rocky V, are probably better than their rep but still quite weak; and the usual line of unchallenging action movies that are below his level. Out of them, from 1990-1996 only Demolition Man emerges with any credit; an action movie as mindless as the rest, but not one without a sense of fun or watchability. It's not that there's anything particularly wrong with mindless action movies, more that such roles only use one part of the acting spectrum. Fine for the likes of Van Damme and Swarzenegger, but when you're able to co-star with DeNiro and Harvey Kietel without disgracing yourself (as Stallone did just the following year in the underrated Cop Land) then it's something of a waste. Stallone saw out the decade with the rewarding animated feature Antz, delivering two of his best pictures back-to-back, just when it seemed all over for any qualitative worth. Immediately following this he fell back into dross, before resuscitating his career in the mid 2000s with decent Rocky and Rambo sequels. It seems the guy really doesn't know what's good for him. As for Daylight, then it does, to be fair to it, deliver on its promise. A disaster movie under a collapsed subway system, said disaster happens well within twenty minutes of the film's commencement, giving us another 90m to endure Stallone gurning around and lots of ciphers shouting at one another. Such a short pre-disaster time may suggest that the characters involved are severely underdeveloped and we never get to know or care about who they are. But just look at that title quote. Someone is called upon to actually say those words. You couldn't blame them if they were glad the dialogue was on the low side, could you?

    Most of the time the enjoyment value in a Sly Stallone film can be astutely judged by the trailer. If he appears with his shirt off (Rambo / Rocky / The Expendables) your juvenile entertainment value is all but assured. If he somehow manages to keep his shirt on (Judge Dredd / Rhinestone / Stop! Or my Mom will shoot etc) things generally don't go so well. In Daylight Stallone keeps his shirt on. Despite this though he manages to find a companion piece to Cop Land in the little known field of 'shirt-on successes'. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Some naughty guys manage to cause a massive explosion in the New York  New Jersey tunnel, simultaneously blocking both ends and leaving the precious few survivors cold, wet and rapidly running out of options. Unfortunately the explosion was 15 or so years too early to prevent the escape of the Jersey Shore and Jerseylicious idiots, but you can't have everything. (Nothing to do with the plot but the actual explosion and subsequent fireworks is awesomely pulled off, I'm not sure if it was miniatures or 90s CGI, I only know I wished for a Blu-Ray instead of the DVD I rented.) Enter Sly Stallone as Kit Latura, who until moments before was merely another New York Cab Driver who didn't speak English. Using skills gleaned from a previous career  that we hear of throughout the film  Kit manages to save many victims in the tunnel exterior before promptly deciding he is the only man capable saving those still trapped inside. And whaddya know he's right. After another tension filled scene Kit finds himself inside and meets the usual motley crew of huddled desperates, with the added spice being provided by the inclusion of a few hardened prisoners that were in transit before the explosion. Among the others are a middle class family, some retirees, a tunnel worker, a genuine high rolling thrill seeker, and of course even a damsel for Kit to save and bond with (Amy Brenneman). From here it is all Hollywood; Kit must cajole and caress the survivors through a series of ever-increasing dangers and perils, with new causes of premature death only seconds behind at all times. There is a direct correlation between how cocky / dangerous you are and your likelihood of living, and of course some good people must be sacrificed in the name of viewer empathy. There's even a dog and a kid for the more hardened viewers out there. Will this sneaky manipulative emotional blackmail ever end? These cumulative dozen or so people, all of who rely solely on Kit to save them from almost certain death by an ever-increasing range of threats, are alternately indignant, ungrateful, defeated, elated, helpful and supportive, depending on the needs of the film at the time. The strange thing is that we've seen it all before  many times  Outbreak came out the year before and tried all the same tricks. But with this film there are 25 examples of 'just when you think it can't get any worse' and somehow they all work. Sure it ain't a Picasso, but strike me if it isn't a tension filled thrill ride (that's at least what the promo poster might say  but it is!). When I plugged in the DVD and settled back I was hoping for little more than a couple hours of time killing. While future viewings might deaden my support I quite enjoyed watching Daylight, which in itself guarantees there will at least be one more viewing at some point in the future. Having avoided Outbreak deliberately for a decade and a half I only wish I could say the same for that monkey-virus drivel. Final Rating  7.5 / 10. Hollywood formula all the way to the bank. The enjoyment bank. (Last The Simpsons joke rip-off for at least 24 hours, I promise.)

    Stallone's one and only disaster film is perfect popcorn entertainment. Like the great disaster films of yore, there are fun parts in the supporting cast, regarding those trapped in a tunnel to New Jersey after a "toxic explosion", with former EMS Chief Stallone trying to lead them out of harm's way as numerous hurdles present themselves causing one terrible situation after another, sacrifices made, courage needed by all if they are to survive. Sure the music telegraphs and manipulates the audience telling us when we are to gasp, to cry, to cheer, but Daylight really establishes just the kind of movie star Stallone is. Battling the elements, like cold water, collapsing debris from with inside the tunnel, constant explosions and quakes, heroism and suspense are in great supply. This movie is designed to toy with your emotions as most disaster movies, infighting and outbursts, death and the proposition of death, trying to find a way out when all hope seems lost, and the rescue of a trapped policeman, caught under a car, as well as, having to accept loss and regretting decisions made when no other options seemed availableDaylight provokes response from the viewer in a way disaster movies often do. Stallone has a demanding role, especially asking of his physicality, including scenes where he must incite belief from the bickering multitude of survivors to keep the faith even when events transpiring seem to indicate certain doom. Cast includes Amy Brenneman (who has a harrowing scene involving a loose cable shooting off electrical sparks), Viggo Mortensen (as a cocky climber celebrity who oozes charisma, but his confidence gets the best of him despite Stallone's warnings to leave a dangerous area certain to avalanche), Dan Hedaya (as Stallone's superior who triggered his firing), Jay O Sanders, Karen Young, and Danielle Harris (as a family under tumult), Claire Bloom (The Haunting) and Colin Fox (as an elderly couple still mourning the loss of their son), and Stan Shaw as George, the policeman who has a gut-wrenching emotional scene where his fate is sealed, causing Stallone to make a devastating choice. There are other characters like prisoners from a bus carrying them, and the various people involved in trying to find a way to get the trapped out of their predicament. Built as a roller-coaster, edge-of-your-seat entertainment, and succeeds, I believe. One of Stallone's more unappreciated 90s films, along with "Cop Land" and "Assassins". As what occurs in other disaster pictures, there are casualties, not surprising considering the situation itself.

    Daylight is a disaster film that stars Sylvester Stallone together with Amy Brenneman, Viggo Mortensen, Dan Hedaya, and Danielle Harris.This echo of 1970s disaster flicks that tells a story of Kit Latura,a disgraced former head of New York City's Emergency Medical Services, a loser who is nevertheless a compulsive rescuer of people in danger.It was directed by Rob Cohen. A truck containing dangerous chemicals explodes in the Holland Tunnel, trapping those New Yorkers not killed in the explosion. Authorities know there are survivors, but cannot figure out what to do to save them. Ruptured water mains and leaks in the tunnel itself, which is beneath the Hudson River, will cause it to fill with water in a few hours. Of all the colorful characters trapped there, only Roy Nord, a mountain climber, has any ideas about what to do, but he quickly dies while attempting to save the others. However, Kit Latura is a former city Emergency Medical Services director who was in the area of the explosion, and he knows the tunnel's construction quirks. He quickly convinces city officials to let him wend his way through the tunnel's maze of exhaust fans to help the exhausted survivors confront the obstacles that await them. This has Stallone as a miscast who outrageously pushes the envelope of his martyr persona to near-religious levels. He throws himself, quite literally, into this part, and between that entertainment factor and the unnervingly convincing effects.Nevertheless,it is a pretty watchable film.

    I am not much into movies where people have to fight natural or man-caused accidents or animals, I prefer good against deliberate evil. Race with time to save people is high-minded, but there is no force to create or fulfill more obstacles. It may be exciting to watch ordinary people overcome themselves, but physical phenomena do not plan their consequences, things just happen due to laws of nature. Such a movie should undoubtedly have some fixed points, but Daylight has too many of them, resulting with less turning points and surprises and a number of unrealistic scenes and episodes. I do like e.g. John McLaine or Dirty Harry much more than Kit Latura. And I have become picky seeing cast representing all different genders-races-backgrounds-ages, moody survivors, moments of self-delusion, ordinary people becoming rescuing heroes...

    Possibly the most insufferably tedious Sylvester Stallone movie ever made, which is no mean feat. The star made a dozen movies during the 90s, and if he was guilty of some bad decisions in the 1980s, then it was nothing compared to what came in the following decade. First we had Rocky inexplicably growing back his Philly accent in a fourth sequel that even Stallone now rejects; two comedies which, like Rocky V, are probably better than their rep but still quite weak; and the usual line of unchallenging action movies that are below his level. Out of them, from 1990-1996 only Demolition Man emerges with any credit; an action movie as mindless as the rest, but not one without a sense of fun or watchability. It's not that there's anything particularly wrong with mindless action movies, more that such roles only use one part of the acting spectrum. Fine for the likes of Van Damme and Swarzenegger, but when you're able to co-star with DeNiro and Harvey Kietel without disgracing yourself (as Stallone did just the following year in the underrated Cop Land) then it's something of a waste. Stallone saw out the decade with the rewarding animated feature Antz, delivering two of his best pictures back-to-back, just when it seemed all over for any qualitative worth. Immediately following this he fell back into dross, before resuscitating his career in the mid 2000s with decent Rocky and Rambo sequels. It seems the guy really doesn't know what's good for him. As for Daylight, then it does, to be fair to it, deliver on its promise. A disaster movie under a collapsed subway system, said disaster happens well within twenty minutes of the film's commencement, giving us another 90m to endure Stallone gurning around and lots of ciphers shouting at one another. Such a short pre-disaster time may suggest that the characters involved are severely underdeveloped and we never get to know or care about who they are. But just look at that title quote. Someone is called upon to actually say those words. You couldn't blame them if they were glad the dialogue was on the low side, could you?

    Most of the time the enjoyment value in a Sly Stallone film can be astutely judged by the trailer. If he appears with his shirt off (Rambo / Rocky / The Expendables) your juvenile entertainment value is all but assured. If he somehow manages to keep his shirt on (Judge Dredd / Rhinestone / Stop! Or my Mom will shoot etc) things generally don't go so well. In Daylight Stallone keeps his shirt on. Despite this though he manages to find a companion piece to Cop Land in the little known field of 'shirt-on successes'. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Some naughty guys manage to cause a massive explosion in the New York  New Jersey tunnel, simultaneously blocking both ends and leaving the precious few survivors cold, wet and rapidly running out of options. Unfortunately the explosion was 15 or so years too early to prevent the escape of the Jersey Shore and Jerseylicious idiots, but you can't have everything. (Nothing to do with the plot but the actual explosion and subsequent fireworks is awesomely pulled off, I'm not sure if it was miniatures or 90s CGI, I only know I wished for a Blu-Ray instead of the DVD I rented.) Enter Sly Stallone as Kit Latura, who until moments before was merely another New York Cab Driver who didn't speak English. Using skills gleaned from a previous career  that we hear of throughout the film  Kit manages to save many victims in the tunnel exterior before promptly deciding he is the only man capable saving those still trapped inside. And whaddya know he's right. After another tension filled scene Kit finds himself inside and meets the usual motley crew of huddled desperates, with the added spice being provided by the inclusion of a few hardened prisoners that were in transit before the explosion. Among the others are a middle class family, some retirees, a tunnel worker, a genuine high rolling thrill seeker, and of course even a damsel for Kit to save and bond with (Amy Brenneman). From here it is all Hollywood; Kit must cajole and caress the survivors through a series of ever-increasing dangers and perils, with new causes of premature death only seconds behind at all times. There is a direct correlation between how cocky / dangerous you are and your likelihood of living, and of course some good people must be sacrificed in the name of viewer empathy. There's even a dog and a kid for the more hardened viewers out there. Will this sneaky manipulative emotional blackmail ever end? These cumulative dozen or so people, all of who rely solely on Kit to save them from almost certain death by an ever-increasing range of threats, are alternately indignant, ungrateful, defeated, elated, helpful and supportive, depending on the needs of the film at the time. The strange thing is that we've seen it all before  many times  Outbreak came out the year before and tried all the same tricks. But with this film there are 25 examples of 'just when you think it can't get any worse' and somehow they all work. Sure it ain't a Picasso, but strike me if it isn't a tension filled thrill ride (that's at least what the promo poster might say  but it is!). When I plugged in the DVD and settled back I was hoping for little more than a couple hours of time killing. While future viewings might deaden my support I quite enjoyed watching Daylight, which in itself guarantees there will at least be one more viewing at some point in the future. Having avoided Outbreak deliberately for a decade and a half I only wish I could say the same for that monkey-virus drivel. Final Rating  7.5 / 10. Hollywood formula all the way to the bank. The enjoyment bank. (Last The Simpsons joke rip-off for at least 24 hours, I promise.)

    Stallone's one and only disaster film is perfect popcorn entertainment. Like the great disaster films of yore, there are fun parts in the supporting cast, regarding those trapped in a tunnel to New Jersey after a "toxic explosion", with former EMS Chief Stallone trying to lead them out of harm's way as numerous hurdles present themselves causing one terrible situation after another, sacrifices made, courage needed by all if they are to survive. Sure the music telegraphs and manipulates the audience telling us when we are to gasp, to cry, to cheer, but Daylight really establishes just the kind of movie star Stallone is. Battling the elements, like cold water, collapsing debris from with inside the tunnel, constant explosions and quakes, heroism and suspense are in great supply. This movie is designed to toy with your emotions as most disaster movies, infighting and outbursts, death and the proposition of death, trying to find a way out when all hope seems lost, and the rescue of a trapped policeman, caught under a car, as well as, having to accept loss and regretting decisions made when no other options seemed availableDaylight provokes response from the viewer in a way disaster movies often do. Stallone has a demanding role, especially asking of his physicality, including scenes where he must incite belief from the bickering multitude of survivors to keep the faith even when events transpiring seem to indicate certain doom. Cast includes Amy Brenneman (who has a harrowing scene involving a loose cable shooting off electrical sparks), Viggo Mortensen (as a cocky climber celebrity who oozes charisma, but his confidence gets the best of him despite Stallone's warnings to leave a dangerous area certain to avalanche), Dan Hedaya (as Stallone's superior who triggered his firing), Jay O Sanders, Karen Young, and Danielle Harris (as a family under tumult), Claire Bloom (The Haunting) and Colin Fox (as an elderly couple still mourning the loss of their son), and Stan Shaw as George, the policeman who has a gut-wrenching emotional scene where his fate is sealed, causing Stallone to make a devastating choice. There are other characters like prisoners from a bus carrying them, and the various people involved in trying to find a way to get the trapped out of their predicament. Built as a roller-coaster, edge-of-your-seat entertainment, and succeeds, I believe. One of Stallone's more unappreciated 90s films, along with "Cop Land" and "Assassins". As what occurs in other disaster pictures, there are casualties, not surprising considering the situation itself.

    Non-stop action with little lead in or lag, this is one of the best low budget (only $80 million to make) action films in the Stallone arsenal. The first 15 minutes of the film is lead in, and only as much character development as we need. Amy Brenneman (Judging Amy, Heat) is a disgruntled screen writer who has had it with New York. Jay O. Sanders and Karen Young, along with daughter Danielle Harris, are a dysfunctional family recovering from a separation. Throw in a bus load of Juvenile offenders in a Corrections bus (among them Sage Stallone and Renoly Santiago), a tunnel guard (Stan Shaw) with romantic attachments to a safety observer (Vanessa Bell Calloway), a hot shot extreme sports hero (Viggo Mortensen) trying to make a publicity coup out of the situation, and elderly couple with their dog, and you have the makings of a film with plenty of angst, drama, paranoia and panic. Stallone plays Kit Latura, formerly the head of the EMS division who was fired a few years back when he lost people in a tunnel explosion and collapse. He is a man of principles who immediately assumes personal responsibility for rescuing the survivors. He risks his life to reach them and works with difficulty to keep them together and alive. When the City Engineers begin to dig out the tunnel, allowing the pressure that is keeping the water from rising, he must find a way to keep them alive while trying to decide how to escape. Rated R for death and destruction, this edge of your seat drama has plenty of fine performances to keep the viewers interested. Collectible is a coin toss. If you are a Stallone fan or you like good action films, you might want this one on the shelf.

    I suppose I might be only slightly biased given that Sylvester Stallone is one of my favorite Hollywood stars. No one nails action like Stallone and this was during his prime to say the least. The thing I love about Daylight is that it isn't your run of the mill action flick because at its heart its really a disaster movie and all about survival with a group of very diverse and captivating people. Stallone is clearly the hero and he just draws you into the story. Many might say the man can't act but this film shows just how great his on screen charisma is. The special effects are terrific, the original disaster that seals the tunnel is breath taking and will put you on the edge of your seat. The films only shortcoming might be that it does not really bring anything new or unique to the disaster genre and often becomes predictable as well. The cast are all terrific and play terrific supporting characters to Stallone. Amy Brenneman is solid as the female lead in the film and her and Stallone actually have very good chemistry. Viggo Mortensen who is a terrific actor actually proves he can also be a supporting actor as well and he is great as the fearless adventurer. Colin Fox and Claire Bloom are outstanding as the senior couple fighting to survive. Character actor Jay Sanders is great as the father who will stop at nothing to save his family. Even Sage Stallone (Sly's real life son) does a great job playing opposite his Dad. Director Rob Cohen has been in the industry for decades and has written produced and directed and he clearly has a handle on what entertains. No one will ever tell you Daylight is a brilliant piece of film making, its not even the most entertaining thing you'll ever see but is it good? Yes! and does it entertain? Absolutely! Everyone can enjoy this film because it has a great story, and might seem typical for a disaster flick but if that's your genre then you won't want to miss this movie because this is a 90's classic!! 8/10

    Truck filled with explosives accidentally explode collapsing a NY tunnel. This is a disaster movie. It's got all the stupidity that comes with it. But even by that standard, this isn't a good example of the genre. Sylvester Stallone is a some kind of disaster planner Kit Latura. Of course he charges in to help get everybody out. And everybody thinks little of him. For some reason, all the people in charge are always wrong. People are too annoying. Everybody is screaming yelling arguing. It's all testosterone. Instead of real emotions, we get overacting. Sly isn't much better. But all the ridiculous machismo really makes Sly almost tame and reasonable.

    Director Rob Cohen is considered by most critics to produce average to slightly above average films. Majority of these opinions are based on who's starring in them. The Fast and the Furious (2001), xXx (2002) & The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008) all were popular at the box office at the time because of who the main lead was. This is no different here. It's no surprise that because Stallone is the main lead that many people decided to go see this movie at the time. In this "disaster" genre film, Sylvester Stallone plays an ordinary man, Kit Latura, who looks straight into the face of death in order to save some survivors when an explosion goes off in an underwater highway tunnel and ends up having both ends sealed off with no escape. Along with Stallone are a few other well-known actors like Chief Frank Kraft (Dan Hedaya) and wealthy businessman Roy Nord (Viggo Mortensen). Even Stallone's son, Sage, plays a smaller role as a convict. Do any of these characters stand out - no not much. If there's any character to really root for, it would be Mortensen's character. Mortensen gave his character a charm none of the others seemed to know how to make. Perhaps because Mortensen just looked at the situation in a whole different way. Compare that to Stallone's performance and it seems like Mortensen should have been the main lead. But if there's one thing that this movie got right, it was the tension. Holy cow was this movie packed with tension! There was not one moment where it felt that no one would make it out. Quite honestly, I don't blame the actors for half their reactions to this situation. If any of us viewers were in their shoes, the majority of us would be freaking out too. It really does feel like a lose-lose situation. Unfortunately, this is another reason why it doesn't entertain as good as it should though. The atmosphere was way too depressing. Not one character (except Viggo Mortensen's character) had one shred of a positive outlook. Not even Stallone's character had one, which kind of shocked me. I'm not sure if Stallone's character was written like that, to make him seem more human but you can still make a character human even if he faces adversity with a confident outlook. But that wasn't visible here. But I assume this is due to the screenwriter, Leslie Bohem, whom according to her pre-writings and post work display that her writing capabilities really need to be assessed more. On the side, Randy Edelman's score to the film was proficient in its work like most of his other productions. What amazed me though is that I enjoyed the music but I also didn't appreciate of how it didn't pick up in tone. It consistently felt depressing. I think Edelman put in a little too much emotion this time (even if it was effective). Finally, the special effects and set designs were probably the most astounding because of how real the situation felt and looked. The scene I was the most nervous about was when Stallone was going through a timed sequence of fan blades...yikes...talk about gut wrenching. But hey, according to Stallone, that's why he took on this project because he wanted to concur his fear of close quarters. Good for him, I'll assume many of us regular people and including myself would not be so eager to go jumping into such problems. As a whole, it works at increasing the tension to a high level along with effective music but sadly it also encourages the characters to be depressing and unlikable. It's close to start being a disaster.

    A bunch of people are trapped in a tunnel underwater when a toxic waste fire manages to block both ends! Good thing that Kit Latura (Sylvester Stallone) is there to help them. I don't disagree that this movie is utterly predictable. All the stock characters are in place (the elderly couple; the teenagers; the dysfunctional family; a policeman) and we have the square-jawed hero to save them. So I knew what was coming every step of the way...but I didn't care. It's VERY well-done! They have a good script that moves fast, top character actors in the minor roles (even Claire Bloom is there!), nonstop action, GREAT special effects, plenty of explosions and some incredible stunt work. Also (for once) the comedy in a film like this that is actually funny:) This was just dismissed as just another stupid Stallone film which is too bad because it's very good. If you're an action film fan u have to see this. Recommended.

Cast includes Amy Brenneman (who has a harrowing scene involving a loose cable shooting off electrical sparks), Viggo Mortensen (as a cocky climber celebrity who oozes charisma, but his confidence gets the best of him despite Stallone's warnings to leave a dangerous area certain to avalanche), Dan Hedaya (as Stallone's superior who triggered his firing), Jay O Sanders, Karen Young, and Danielle Harris (as a family under tumult), Claire Bloom (The Haunting) and Colin Fox (as an elderly couple still mourning the loss of their son), and Stan Shaw as George, the policeman who has a gut-wrenching emotional scene where his fate is sealed, causing Stallone to make a devastating choice. There are other characters like prisoners from a bus carrying them, and the various people involved in trying to find a way to get the trapped out of their predicament. Built as a roller-coaster, edge-of-your-seat entertainment, and succeeds, I believe. One of Stallone's more unappreciated 90s films, along with "Cop Land" and "Assassins". As what occurs in other disaster pictures, there are casualties, not surprising considering the situation itself.

    Non-stop action with little lead in or lag, this is one of the best low budget (only $80 million to make) action films in the Stallone arsenal. The first 15 minutes of the film is lead in, and only as much character development as we need. Amy Brenneman (Judging Amy, Heat) is a disgruntled screen writer who has had it with New York. Jay O. Sanders and Karen Young, along with daughter Danielle Harris, are a dysfunctional family recovering from a separation. Throw in a bus load of Juvenile offenders in a Corrections bus (among them Sage Stallone and Renoly Santiago), a tunnel guard (Stan Shaw) with romantic attachments to a safety observer (Vanessa Bell Calloway), a hot shot extreme sports hero (Viggo Mortensen) trying to make a publicity coup out of the situation, and elderly couple with their dog, and you have the makings of a film with plenty of angst, drama, paranoia and panic. Stallone plays Kit Latura, formerly the head of the EMS division who was fired a few years back when he lost people in a tunnel explosion and collapse. He is a man of principles who immediately assumes personal responsibility for rescuing the survivors. He risks his life to reach them and works with difficulty to keep them together and alive. When the City Engineers begin to dig out the tunnel, allowing the pressure that is keeping the water from rising, he must find a way to keep them alive while trying to decide how to escape. Rated R for death and destruction, this edge of your seat drama has plenty of fine performances to keep the viewers interested. Collectible is a coin toss. If you are a Stallone fan or you like good action films, you might want this one on the shelf.

    I suppose I might be only slightly biased given that Sylvester Stallone is one of my favorite Hollywood stars. No one nails action like Stallone and this was during his prime to say the least. The thing I love about Daylight is that it isn't your run of the mill action flick because at its heart its really a disaster movie and all about survival with a group of very diverse and captivating people. Stallone is clearly the hero and he just draws you into the story. Many might say the man can't act but this film shows just how great his on screen charisma is. The special effects are terrific, the original disaster that seals the tunnel is breath taking and will put you on the edge of your seat. The films only shortcoming might be that it does not really bring anything new or unique to the disaster genre and often becomes predictable as well. The cast are all terrific and play terrific supporting characters to Stallone. Amy Brenneman is solid as the female lead in the film and her and Stallone actually have very good chemistry. Viggo Mortensen who is a terrific actor actually proves he can also be a supporting actor as well and he is great as the fearless adventurer. Colin Fox and Claire Bloom are outstanding as the senior couple fighting to survive. Character actor Jay Sanders is great as the father who will stop at nothing to save his family. Even Sage Stallone (Sly's real life son) does a great job playing opposite his Dad. Director Rob Cohen has been in the industry for decades and has written produced and directed and he clearly has a handle on what entertains. No one will ever tell you Daylight is a brilliant piece of film making, its not even the most entertaining thing you'll ever see but is it good? Yes! and does it entertain? Absolutely! Everyone can enjoy this film because it has a great story, and might seem typical for a disaster flick but if that's your genre then you won't want to miss this movie because this is a 90's classic!! 8/10

    Truck filled with explosives accidentally explode collapsing a NY tunnel. This is a disaster movie. It's got all the stupidity that comes with it. But even by that standard, this isn't a good example of the genre. Sylvester Stallone is a some kind of disaster planner Kit Latura. Of course he charges in to help get everybody out. And everybody thinks little of him. For some reason, all the people in charge are always wrong. People are too annoying. Everybody is screaming yelling arguing. It's all testosterone. Instead of real emotions, we get overacting. Sly isn't much better. But all the ridiculous machismo really makes Sly almost tame and reasonable.

    Director Rob Cohen is considered by most critics to produce average to slightly above average films. Majority of these opinions are based on who's starring in them. The Fast and the Furious (2001), xXx (2002) & The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008) all were popular at the box office at the time because of who the main lead was. This is no different here. It's no surprise that because Stallone is the main lead that many people decided to go see this movie at the time. In this "disaster" genre film, Sylvester Stallone plays an ordinary man, Kit Latura, who looks straight into the face of death in order to save some survivors when an explosion goes off in an underwater highway tunnel and ends up having both ends sealed off with no escape. Along with Stallone are a few other well-known actors like Chief Frank Kraft (Dan Hedaya) and wealthy businessman Roy Nord (Viggo Mortensen). Even Stallone's son, Sage, plays a smaller role as a convict. Do any of these characters stand out - no not much. If there's any character to really root for, it would be Mortensen's character. Mortensen gave his character a charm none of the others seemed to know how to make. Perhaps because Mortensen just looked at the situation in a whole different way. Compare that to Stallone's performance and it seems like Mortensen should have been the main lead. But if there's one thing that this movie got right, it was the tension. Holy cow was this movie packed with tension! There was not one moment where it felt that no one would make it out. Quite honestly, I don't blame the actors for half their reactions to this situation. If any of us viewers were in their shoes, the majority of us would be freaking out too. It really does feel like a lose-lose situation. Unfortunately, this is another reason why it doesn't entertain as good as it should though. The atmosphere was way too depressing. Not one character (except Viggo Mortensen's character) had one shred of a positive outlook. Not even Stallone's character had one, which kind of shocked me. I'm not sure if Stallone's character was written like that, to make him seem more human but you can still make a character human even if he faces adversity with a confident outlook. But that wasn't visible here. But I assume this is due to the screenwriter, Leslie Bohem, whom according to her pre-writings and post work display that her writing capabilities really need to be assessed more. On the side, Randy Edelman's score to the film was proficient in its work like most of his other productions. What amazed me though is that I enjoyed the music but I also didn't appreciate of how it didn't pick up in tone. It consistently felt depressing. I think Edelman put in a little too much emotion this time (even if it was effective). Finally, the special effects and set designs were probably the most astounding because of how real the situation felt and looked. The scene I was the most nervous about was when Stallone was going through a timed sequence of fan blades...yikes...talk about gut wrenching. But hey, according to Stallone, that's why he took on this project because he wanted to concur his fear of close quarters. Good for him, I'll assume many of us regular people and including myself would not be so eager to go jumping into such problems. As a whole, it works at increasing the tension to a high level along with effective music but sadly it also encourages the characters to be depressing and unlikable. It's close to start being a disaster.

    A bunch of people are trapped in a tunnel underwater when a toxic waste fire manages to block both ends! Good thing that Kit Latura (Sylvester Stallone) is there to help them. I don't disagree that this movie is utterly predictable. All the stock characters are in place (the elderly couple; the teenagers; the dysfunctional family; a policeman) and we have the square-jawed hero to save them. So I knew what was coming every step of the way...but I didn't care. It's VERY well-done! They have a good script that moves fast, top character actors in the minor roles (even Claire Bloom is there!), nonstop action, GREAT special effects, plenty of explosions and some incredible stunt work. Also (for once) the comedy in a film like this that is actually funny:) This was just dismissed as just another stupid Stallone film which is too bad because it's very good. If you're an action film fan u have to see this. Recommended.

    Daylight is a disaster film that stars Sylvester Stallone together with Amy Brenneman, Viggo Mortensen, Dan Hedaya, and Danielle Harris.This echo of 1970s disaster flicks that tells a story of Kit Latura,a disgraced former head of New York City's Emergency Medical Services, a loser who is nevertheless a compulsive rescuer of people in danger.It was directed by Rob Cohen. A truck containing dangerous chemicals explodes in the Holland Tunnel, trapping those New Yorkers not killed in the explosion. Authorities know there are survivors, but cannot figure out what to do to save them. Ruptured water mains and leaks in the tunnel itself, which is beneath the Hudson River, will cause it to fill with water in a few hours. Of all the colorful characters trapped there, only Roy Nord, a mountain climber, has any ideas about what to do, but he quickly dies while attempting to save the others. However, Kit Latura is a former city Emergency Medical Services director who was in the area of the explosion, and he knows the tunnel's construction quirks. He quickly convinces city officials to let him wend his way through the tunnel's maze of exhaust fans to help the exhausted survivors confront the obstacles that await them. This has Stallone as a miscast who outrageously pushes the envelope of his martyr persona to near-religious levels. He throws himself, quite literally, into this part, and between that entertainment factor and the unnervingly convincing effects.Nevertheless,it is a pretty watchable film.

    I am not much into movies where people have to fight natural or man-caused accidents or animals, I prefer good against deliberate evil. Race with time to save people is high-minded, but there is no force to create or fulfill more obstacles. It may be exciting to watch ordinary people overcome themselves, but physical phenomena do not plan their consequences, things just happen due to laws of nature. Such a movie should undoubtedly have some fixed points, but Daylight has too many of them, resulting with less turning points and surprises and a number of unrealistic scenes and episodes. I do like e.g. John McLaine or Dirty Harry much more than Kit Latura. And I have become picky seeing cast representing all different genders-races-backgrounds-ages, moody survivors, moments of self-delusion, ordinary people becoming rescuing heroes...

    Possibly the most insufferably tedious Sylvester Stallone movie ever made, which is no mean feat. The star made a dozen movies during the 90s, and if he was guilty of some bad decisions in the 1980s, then it was nothing compared to what came in the following decade. First we had Rocky inexplicably growing back his Philly accent in a fourth sequel that even Stallone now rejects; two comedies which, like Rocky V, are probably better than their rep but still quite weak; and the usual line of unchallenging action movies that are below his level. Out of them, from 1990-1996 only Demolition Man emerges with any credit; an action movie as mindless as the rest, but not one without a sense of fun or watchability. It's not that there's anything particularly wrong with mindless action movies, more that such roles only use one part of the acting spectrum. Fine for the likes of Van Damme and Swarzenegger, but when you're able to co-star with DeNiro and Harvey Kietel without disgracing yourself (as Stallone did just the following year in the underrated Cop Land) then it's something of a waste. Stallone saw out the decade with the rewarding animated feature Antz, delivering two of his best pictures back-to-back, just when it seemed all over for any qualitative worth. Immediately following this he fell back into dross, before resuscitating his career in the mid 2000s with decent Rocky and Rambo sequels. It seems the guy really doesn't know what's good for him. As for Daylight, then it does, to be fair to it, deliver on its promise. A disaster movie under a collapsed subway system, said disaster happens well within twenty minutes of the film's commencement, giving us another 90m to endure Stallone gurning around and lots of ciphers shouting at one another. Such a short pre-disaster time may suggest that the characters involved are severely underdeveloped and we never get to know or care about who they are. But just look at that title quote. Someone is called upon to actually say those words. You couldn't blame them if they were glad the dialogue was on the low side, could you?

    Most of the time the enjoyment value in a Sly Stallone film can be astutely judged by the trailer. If he appears with his shirt off (Rambo / Rocky / The Expendables) your juvenile entertainment value is all but assured. If he somehow manages to keep his shirt on (Judge Dredd / Rhinestone / Stop! Or my Mom will shoot etc) things generally don't go so well. In Daylight Stallone keeps his shirt on. Despite this though he manages to find a companion piece to Cop Land in the little known field of 'shirt-on successes'. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Some naughty guys manage to cause a massive explosion in the New York  New Jersey tunnel, simultaneously blocking both ends and leaving the precious few survivors cold, wet and rapidly running out of options. Unfortunately the explosion was 15 or so years too early to prevent the escape of the Jersey Shore and Jerseylicious idiots, but you can't have everything. (Nothing to do with the plot but the actual explosion and subsequent fireworks is awesomely pulled off, I'm not sure if it was miniatures or 90s CGI, I only know I wished for a Blu-Ray instead of the DVD I rented.) Enter Sly Stallone as Kit Latura, who until moments before was merely another New York Cab Driver who didn't speak English. Using skills gleaned from a previous career  that we hear of throughout the film  Kit manages to save many victims in the tunnel exterior before promptly deciding he is the only man capable saving those still trapped inside. And whaddya know he's right. After another tension filled scene Kit finds himself inside and meets the usual motley crew of huddled desperates, with the added spice being provided by the inclusion of a few hardened prisoners that were in transit before the explosion. Among the others are a middle class family, some retirees, a tunnel worker, a genuine high rolling thrill seeker, and of course even a damsel for Kit to save and bond with (Amy Brenneman). From here it is all Hollywood; Kit must cajole and caress the survivors through a series of ever-increasing dangers and perils, with new causes of premature death only seconds behind at all times. There is a direct correlation between how cocky / dangerous you are and your likelihood of living, and of course some good people must be sacrificed in the name of viewer empathy. There's even a dog and a kid for the more hardened viewers out there. Will this sneaky manipulative emotional blackmail ever end? These cumulative dozen or so people, all of who rely solely on Kit to save them from almost certain death by an ever-increasing range of threats, are alternately indignant, ungrateful, defeated, elated, helpful and supportive, depending on the needs of the film at the time. The strange thing is that we've seen it all before  many times  Outbreak came out the year before and tried all the same tricks. But with this film there are 25 examples of 'just when you think it can't get any worse' and somehow they all work. Sure it ain't a Picasso, but strike me if it isn't a tension filled thrill ride (that's at least what the promo poster might say  but it is!). When I plugged in the DVD and settled back I was hoping for little more than a couple hours of time killing. While future viewings might deaden my support I quite enjoyed watching Daylight, which in itself guarantees there will at least be one more viewing at some point in the future. Having avoided Outbreak deliberately for a decade and a half I only wish I could say the same for that monkey-virus drivel. Final Rating  7.5 / 10. Hollywood formula all the way to the bank. The enjoyment bank. (Last The Simpsons joke rip-off for at least 24 hours, I promise.)

    Stallone's one and only disaster film is perfect popcorn entertainment. Like the great disaster films of yore, there are fun parts in the supporting cast, regarding those trapped in a tunnel to New Jersey after a "toxic explosion", with former EMS Chief Stallone trying to lead them out of harm's way as numerous hurdles present themselves causing one terrible situation after another, sacrifices made, courage needed by all if they are to survive. Sure the music telegraphs and manipulates the audience telling us when we are to gasp, to cry, to cheer, but Daylight really establishes just the kind of movie star Stallone is. Battling the elements, like cold water, collapsing debris from with inside the tunnel, constant explosions and quakes, heroism and suspense are in great supply. This movie is designed to toy with your emotions as most disaster movies, infighting and outbursts, death and the proposition of death, trying to find a way out when all hope seems lost, and the rescue of a trapped policeman, caught under a car, as well as, having to accept loss and regretting decisions made when no other options seemed availableDaylight provokes response from the viewer in a way disaster movies often do. Stallone has a demanding role, especially asking of his physicality, including scenes where he must incite belief from the bickering multitude of survivors to keep the faith even when events transpiring seem to indicate certain doom. Cast includes Amy Brenneman (who has a harrowing scene involving a loose cable shooting off electrical sparks), Viggo Mortensen (as a cocky climber celebrity who oozes charisma, but his confidence gets the best of him despite Stallone's warnings to leave a dangerous area certain to avalanche), Dan Hedaya (as Stallone's superior who triggered his firing), Jay O Sanders, Karen Young, and Danielle Harris (as a family under tumult), Claire Bloom (The Haunting) and Colin Fox (as an elderly couple still mourning the loss of their son), and Stan Shaw as George, the policeman who has a gut-wrenching emotional scene where his fate is sealed, causing Stallone to make a devastating choice. There are other characters like prisoners from a bus carrying them, and the various people involved in trying to find a way to get the trapped out of their predicament. Built as a roller-coaster, edge-of-your-seat entertainment, and succeeds, I believe. One of Stallone's more unappreciated 90s films, along with "Cop Land" and "Assassins".

    A bunch of people are trapped in a tunnel underwater when a toxic waste fire manages to block both ends! Good thing that Kit Latura (Sylvester Stallone) is there to help them. I don't disagree that this movie is utterly predictable. All the stock characters are in place (the elderly couple; the teenagers; the dysfunctional family; a policeman) and we have the square-jawed hero to save them. So I knew what was coming every step of the way...but I didn't care. It's VERY well-done! They have a good script that moves fast, top character actors in the minor roles (even Claire Bloom is there!), nonstop action, GREAT special effects, plenty of explosions and some incredible stunt work. Also (for once) the comedy in a film like this that is actually funny:) This was just dismissed as just another stupid Stallone film which is too bad because it's very good. If you're an action film fan u have to see this. Recommended.

    Daylight is a disaster film that stars Sylvester Stallone together with Amy Brenneman, Viggo Mortensen, Dan Hedaya, and Danielle Harris.This echo of 1970s disaster flicks that tells a story of Kit Latura,a disgraced former head of New York City's Emergency Medical Services, a loser who is nevertheless a compulsive rescuer of people in danger.It was directed by Rob Cohen. A truck containing dangerous chemicals explodes in the Holland Tunnel, trapping those New Yorkers not killed in the explosion. Authorities know there are survivors, but cannot figure out what to do to save them. Ruptured water mains and leaks in the tunnel itself, which is beneath the Hudson River, will cause it to fill with water in a few hours. Of all the colorful characters trapped there, only Roy Nord, a mountain climber, has any ideas about what to do, but he quickly dies while attempting to save the others. However, Kit Latura is a former city Emergency Medical Services director who was in the area of the explosion, and he knows the tunnel's construction quirks. He quickly convinces city officials to let him wend his way through the tunnel's maze of exhaust fans to help the exhausted survivors confront the obstacles that await them. This has Stallone as a miscast who outrageously pushes the envelope of his martyr persona to near-religious levels. He throws himself, quite literally, into this part, and between that entertainment factor and the unnervingly convincing effects.Nevertheless,it is a pretty watchable film.

    I am not much into movies where people have to fight natural or man-caused accidents or animals, I prefer good against deliberate evil. Race with time to save people is high-minded, but there is no force to create or fulfill more obstacles. It may be exciting to watch ordinary people overcome themselves, but physical phenomena do not plan their consequences, things just happen due to laws of nature. Such a movie should undoubtedly have some fixed points, but Daylight has too many of them, resulting with less turning points and surprises and a number of unrealistic scenes and episodes. I do like e.g. John McLaine or Dirty Harry much more than Kit Latura. And I have become picky seeing cast representing all different genders-races-backgrounds-ages, moody survivors, moments of self-delusion, ordinary people becoming rescuing heroes...

    Possibly the most insufferably tedious Sylvester Stallone movie ever made, which is no mean feat. The star made a dozen movies during the 90s, and if he was guilty of some bad decisions in the 1980s, then it was nothing compared to what came in the following decade. First we had Rocky inexplicably growing back his Philly accent in a fourth sequel that even Stallone now rejects; two comedies which, like Rocky V, are probably better than their rep but still quite weak; and the usual line of unchallenging action movies that are below his level. Out of them, from 1990-1996 only Demolition Man emerges with any credit; an action movie as mindless as the rest, but not one without a sense of fun or watchability. It's not that there's anything particularly wrong with mindless action movies, more that such roles only use one part of the acting spectrum. Fine for the likes of Van Damme and Swarzenegger, but when you're able to co-star with DeNiro and Harvey Kietel without disgracing yourself (as Stallone did just the following year in the underrated Cop Land) then it's something of a waste. Stallone saw out the decade with the rewarding animated feature Antz, delivering two of his best pictures back-to-back, just when it seemed all over for any qualitative worth. Immediately following this he fell back into dross, before resuscitating his career in the mid 2000s with decent Rocky and Rambo sequels. It seems the guy really doesn't know what's good for him. As for Daylight, then it does, to be fair to it, deliver on its promise. A disaster movie under a collapsed subway system, said disaster happens well within twenty minutes of the film's commencement, giving us another 90m to endure Stallone gurning around and lots of ciphers shouting at one another. Such a short pre-disaster time may suggest that the characters involved are severely underdeveloped and we never get to know or care about who they are. But just look at that title quote. Someone is called upon to actually say those words. You couldn't blame them if they were glad the dialogue was on the low side, could you?

    Most of the time the enjoyment value in a Sly Stallone film can be astutely judged by the trailer. If he appears with his shirt off (Rambo / Rocky / The Expendables) your juvenile entertainment value is all but assured. If he somehow manages to keep his shirt on (Judge Dredd / Rhinestone / Stop! Or my Mom will shoot etc) things generally don't go so well. In Daylight Stallone keeps his shirt on. Despite this though he manages to find a companion piece to Cop Land in the little known field of 'shirt-on successes'. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Some naughty guys manage to cause a massive explosion in the New York  New Jersey tunnel, simultaneously blocking both ends and leaving the precious few survivors cold, wet and rapidly running out of options. Unfortunately the explosion was 15 or so years too early to prevent the escape of the Jersey Shore and Jerseylicious idiots, but you can't have everything. (Nothing to do with the plot but the actual explosion and subsequent fireworks is awesomely pulled off, I'm not sure if it was miniatures or 90s CGI, I only know I wished for a Blu-Ray instead of the DVD I rented.) Enter Sly Stallone as Kit Latura, who until moments before was merely another New York Cab Driver who didn't speak English. Using skills gleaned from a previous career  that we hear of throughout the film  Kit manages to save many victims in the tunnel exterior before promptly deciding he is the only man capable saving those still trapped inside. And whaddya know he's right. After another tension filled scene Kit finds himself inside and meets the usual motley crew of huddled desperates, with the added spice being provided by the inclusion of a few hardened prisoners that were in transit before the explosion. Among the others are a middle class family, some retirees, a tunnel worker, a genuine high rolling thrill seeker, and of course even a damsel for Kit to save and bond with (Amy Brenneman). From here it is all Hollywood; Kit must cajole and caress the survivors through a series of ever-increasing dangers and perils, with new causes of premature death only seconds behind at all times. There is a direct correlation between how cocky / dangerous you are and your likelihood of living, and of course some good people must be sacrificed in the name of viewer empathy. There's even a dog and a kid for the more hardened viewers out there. Will this sneaky manipulative emotional blackmail ever end? These cumulative dozen or so people, all of who rely solely on Kit to save them from almost certain death by an ever-increasing range of threats, are alternately indignant, ungrateful, defeated, elated, helpful and supportive, depending on the needs of the film at the time. The strange thing is that we've seen it all before  many times  Outbreak came out the year before and tried all the same tricks. But with this film there are 25 examples of 'just when you think it can't get any worse' and somehow they all work. Sure it ain't a Picasso, but strike me if it isn't a tension filled thrill ride (that's at least what the promo poster might say  but it is!). When I plugged in the DVD and settled back I was hoping for little more than a couple hours of time killing. While future viewings might deaden my support I quite enjoyed watching Daylight, which in itself guarantees there will at least be one more viewing at some point in the future. Having avoided Outbreak deliberately for a decade and a half I only wish I could say the same for that monkey-virus drivel. Final Rating  7.5 / 10. Hollywood formula all the way to the bank. The enjoyment bank. (Last The Simpsons joke rip-off for at least 24 hours, I promise.)

    Stallone's one and only disaster film is perfect popcorn entertainment. Like the great disaster films of yore, there are fun parts in the supporting cast, regarding those trapped in a tunnel to New Jersey after a "toxic explosion", with former EMS Chief Stallone trying to lead them out of harm's way as numerous hurdles present themselves causing one terrible situation after another, sacrifices made, courage needed by all if they are to survive. Sure the music telegraphs and manipulates the audience telling us when we are to gasp, to cry, to cheer, but Daylight really establishes just the kind of movie star Stallone is. Battling the elements, like cold water, collapsing debris from with inside the tunnel, constant explosions and quakes, heroism and suspense are in great supply. This movie is designed to toy with your emotions as most disaster movies, infighting and outbursts, death and the proposition of death, trying to find a way out when all hope seems lost, and the rescue of a trapped policeman, caught under a car, as well as, having to accept loss and regretting decisions made when no other options seemed availableDaylight provokes response from the viewer in a way disaster movies often do. Stallone has a demanding role, especially asking of his physicality, including scenes where he must incite belief from the bickering multitude of survivors to keep the faith even when events transpiring seem to indicate certain doom. Cast includes Amy Brenneman (who has a harrowing scene involving a loose cable shooting off electrical sparks), Viggo Mortensen (as a cocky climber celebrity who oozes charisma, but his confidence gets the best of him despite Stallone's warnings to leave a dangerous area certain to avalanche), Dan Hedaya (as Stallone's superior who triggered his firing), Jay O Sanders, Karen Young, and Danielle Harris (as a family under tumult), Claire Bloom (The Haunting) and Colin Fox (as an elderly couple still mourning the loss of their son), and Stan Shaw as George, the policeman who has a gut-wrenching emotional scene where his fate is sealed, causing Stallone to make a devastating choice. There are other characters like prisoners from a bus carrying them, and the various people involved in trying to find a way to get the trapped out of their predicament. Built as a roller-coaster, edge-of-your-seat entertainment, and succeeds, I believe. One of Stallone's more unappreciated 90s films, along with "Cop Land" and "Assassins". As what occurs in other disaster pictures, there are casualties, not surprising considering the situation itself.

    Non-stop action with little lead in or lag, this is one of the best low budget (only $80 million to make) action films in the Stallone arsenal. The first 15 minutes of the film is lead in, and only as much character development as we need. Amy Brenneman (Judging Amy, Heat) is a disgruntled screen writer who has had it with New York. Jay O. Sanders and Karen Young, along with daughter Danielle Harris, are a dysfunctional family recovering from a separation. Throw in a bus load of Juvenile offenders in a Corrections bus (among them Sage Stallone and Renoly Santiago), a tunnel guard (Stan Shaw) with romantic attachments to a safety observer (Vanessa Bell Calloway), a hot shot extreme sports hero (Viggo Mortensen) trying to make a publicity coup out of the situation, and elderly couple with their dog, and you have the makings of a film with plenty of angst, drama, paranoia and panic. Stallone plays Kit Latura, formerly the head of the EMS division who was fired a few years back when he lost people in a tunnel explosion and collapse. He is a man of principles who immediately assumes personal responsibility for rescuing the survivors. He risks his life to reach them and works with difficulty to keep them together and alive. When the City Engineers begin to dig out the tunnel, allowing the pressure that is keeping the water from rising, he must find a way to keep them alive while trying to decide how to escape. Rated R for death and destruction, this edge of your seat drama has plenty of fine performances to keep the viewers interested. Collectible is a coin toss. If you are a Stallone fan or you like good action films, you might want this one on the shelf.

    I suppose I might be only slightly biased given that Sylvester Stallone is one of my favorite Hollywood stars. No one nails action like Stallone and this was during his prime to say the least. The thing I love about Daylight is that it isn't your run of the mill action flick because at its heart its really a disaster movie and all about survival with a group of very diverse and captivating people. Stallone is clearly the hero and he just draws you into the story. Many might say the man can't act but this film shows just how great his on screen charisma is. The special effects are terrific, the original disaster that seals the tunnel is breath taking and will put you on the edge of your seat. The films only shortcoming might be that it does not really bring anything new or unique to the disaster genre and often becomes predictable as well. The cast are all terrific and play terrific supporting characters to Stallone. Amy Brenneman is solid as the female lead in the film and her and Stallone actually have very good chemistry. Viggo Mortensen who is a terrific actor actually proves he can also be a supporting actor as well and he is great as the fearless adventurer. Colin Fox and Claire Bloom are outstanding as the senior couple fighting to survive. Character actor Jay Sanders is great as the father who will stop at nothing to save his family. Even Sage Stallone (Sly's real life son) does a great job playing opposite his Dad. Director Rob Cohen has been in the industry for decades and has written produced and directed and he clearly has a handle on what entertains. No one will ever tell you Daylight is a brilliant piece of film making, its not even the most entertaining thing you'll ever see but is it good? Yes! and does it entertain? Absolutely! Everyone can enjoy this film because it has a great story, and might seem typical for a disaster flick but if that's your genre then you won't want to miss this movie because this is a 90's classic!! 8/10

    Truck filled with explosives accidentally explode collapsing a NY tunnel. This is a disaster movie. It's got all the stupidity that comes with it. But even by that standard, this isn't a good example of the genre. Sylvester Stallone is a some kind of disaster planner Kit Latura. Of course he charges in to help get everybody out. And everybody thinks little of him. For some reason, all the people in charge are always wrong. People are too annoying. Everybody is screaming yelling arguing. It's all testosterone. Instead of real emotions, we get overacting. Sly isn't much better. But all the ridiculous machismo really makes Sly almost tame and reasonable.

    Director Rob Cohen is considered by most critics to produce average to slightly above average films. Majority of these opinions are based on who's starring in them. The Fast and the Furious (2001), xXx (2002) & The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008) all were popular at the box office at the time because of who the main lead was. This is no different here. It's no surprise that because Stallone is the main lead that many people decided to go see this movie at the time. In this "disaster" genre film, Sylvester Stallone plays an ordinary man, Kit Latura, who looks straight into the face of death in order to save some survivors when an explosion goes off in an underwater highway tunnel and ends up having both ends sealed off with no escape. Along with Stallone are a few other well-known actors like Chief Frank Kraft (Dan Hedaya) and wealthy businessman Roy Nord (Viggo Mortensen). Even Stallone's son, Sage, plays a smaller role as a convict. Do any of these characters stand out - no not much. If there's any character to really root for, it would be Mortensen's character. Mortensen gave his character a charm none of the others seemed to know how to make. Perhaps because Mortensen just looked at the situation in a whole different way. Compare that to Stallone's performance and it seems like Mortensen should have been the main lead. But if there's one thing that this movie got right, it was the tension. Holy cow was this movie packed with tension! There was not one moment where it felt that no one would make it out. Quite honestly, I don't blame the actors for half their reactions to this situation. If any of us viewers were in their shoes, the majority of us would be freaking out too. It really does feel like a lose-lose situation. Unfortunately, this is another reason why it doesn't entertain as good as it should though. The atmosphere was way too depressing. Not one character (except Viggo Mortensen's character) had one shred of a positive outlook. Not even Stallone's character had one, which kind of shocked me. I'm not sure if Stallone's character was written like that, to make him seem more human but you can still make a character human even if he faces adversity with a confident outlook. But that wasn't visible here. But I assume this is due to the screenwriter, Leslie Bohem, whom according to her pre-writings and post work display that her writing capabilities really need to be assessed more. On the side, Randy Edelman's score to the film was proficient in its work like most of his other productions. What amazed me though is that I enjoyed the music but I also didn't appreciate of how it didn't pick up in tone. It consistently felt depressing. I think Edelman put in a little too much emotion this time (even if it was effective). Finally, the special effects and set designs were probably the most astounding because of how real the situation felt and looked. The scene I was the most nervous about was when Stallone was going through a timed sequence of fan blades...yikes...talk about gut wrenching. But hey, according to Stallone, that's why he took on this project because he wanted to concur his fear of close quarters. Good for him, I'll assume many of us regular people and including myself would not be so eager to go jumping into such problems. As a whole, it works at increasing the tension to a high level along with effective music but sadly it also encourages the characters to be depressing and unlikable. It's close to start being a disaster.

Having avoided Outbreak deliberately for a decade and a half I only wish I could say the same for that monkey-virus drivel. Final Rating  7.5 / 10. Hollywood formula all the way to the bank. The enjoyment bank. (Last The Simpsons joke rip-off for at least 24 hours, I promise.)

    Stallone's one and only disaster film is perfect popcorn entertainment. Like the great disaster films of yore, there are fun parts in the supporting cast, regarding those trapped in a tunnel to New Jersey after a "toxic explosion", with former EMS Chief Stallone trying to lead them out of harm's way as numerous hurdles present themselves causing one terrible situation after another, sacrifices made, courage needed by all if they are to survive. Sure the music telegraphs and manipulates the audience telling us when we are to gasp, to cry, to cheer, but Daylight really establishes just the kind of movie star Stallone is. Battling the elements, like cold water, collapsing debris from with inside the tunnel, constant explosions and quakes, heroism and suspense are in great supply. This movie is designed to toy with your emotions as most disaster movies, infighting and outbursts, death and the proposition of death, trying to find a way out when all hope seems lost, and the rescue of a trapped policeman, caught under a car, as well as, having to accept loss and regretting decisions made when no other options seemed availableDaylight provokes response from the viewer in a way disaster movies often do. Stallone has a demanding role, especially asking of his physicality, including scenes where he must incite belief from the bickering multitude of survivors to keep the faith even when events transpiring seem to indicate certain doom. Cast includes Amy Brenneman (who has a harrowing scene involving a loose cable shooting off electrical sparks), Viggo Mortensen (as a cocky climber celebrity who oozes charisma, but his confidence gets the best of him despite Stallone's warnings to leave a dangerous area certain to avalanche), Dan Hedaya (as Stallone's superior who triggered his firing), Jay O Sanders, Karen Young, and Danielle Harris (as a family under tumult), Claire Bloom (The Haunting) and Colin Fox (as an elderly couple still mourning the loss of their son), and Stan Shaw as George, the policeman who has a gut-wrenching emotional scene where his fate is sealed, causing Stallone to make a devastating choice. There are other characters like prisoners from a bus carrying them, and the various people involved in trying to find a way to get the trapped out of their predicament. Built as a roller-coaster, edge-of-your-seat entertainment, and succeeds, I believe. One of Stallone's more unappreciated 90s films, along with "Cop Land" and "Assassins". As what occurs in other disaster pictures, there are casualties, not surprising considering the situation itself.

    Non-stop action with little lead in or lag, this is one of the best low budget (only $80 million to make) action films in the Stallone arsenal.

    Non-stop action with little lead in or lag, this is one of the best low budget (only $80 million to make) action films in the Stallone arsenal. The first 15 minutes of the film is lead in, and only as much character development as we need. Amy Brenneman (Judging Amy, Heat) is a disgruntled screen writer who has had it with New York. Jay O. Sanders and Karen Young, along with daughter Danielle Harris, are a dysfunctional family recovering from a separation. Throw in a bus load of Juvenile offenders in a Corrections bus (among them Sage Stallone and Renoly Santiago), a tunnel guard (Stan Shaw) with romantic attachments to a safety observer (Vanessa Bell Calloway), a hot shot extreme sports hero (Viggo Mortensen) trying to make a publicity coup out of the situation, and elderly couple with their dog, and you have the makings of a film with plenty of angst, drama, paranoia and panic. Stallone plays Kit Latura, formerly the head of the EMS division who was fired a few years back when he lost people in a tunnel explosion and collapse. He is a man of principles who immediately assumes personal responsibility for rescuing the survivors. He risks his life to reach them and works with difficulty to keep them together and alive. When the City Engineers begin to dig out the tunnel, allowing the pressure that is keeping the water from rising, he must find a way to keep them alive while trying to decide how to escape. Rated R for death and destruction, this edge of your seat drama has plenty of fine performances to keep the viewers interested. Collectible is a coin toss. If you are a Stallone fan or you like good action films, you might want this one on the shelf.

    I suppose I might be only slightly biased given that Sylvester Stallone is one of my favorite Hollywood stars. No one nails action like Stallone and this was during his prime to say the least. The thing I love about Daylight is that it isn't your run of the mill action flick because at its heart its really a disaster movie and all about survival with a group of very diverse and captivating people. Stallone is clearly the hero and he just draws you into the story. Many might say the man can't act but this film shows just how great his on screen charisma is. The special effects are terrific, the original disaster that seals the tunnel is breath taking and will put you on the edge of your seat. The films only shortcoming might be that it does not really bring anything new or unique to the disaster genre and often becomes predictable as well. The cast are all terrific and play terrific supporting characters to Stallone. Amy Brenneman is solid as the female lead in the film and her and Stallone actually have very good chemistry. Viggo Mortensen who is a terrific actor actually proves he can also be a supporting actor as well and he is great as the fearless adventurer. Colin Fox and Claire Bloom are outstanding as the senior couple fighting to survive. Character actor Jay Sanders is great as the father who will stop at nothing to save his family. Even Sage Stallone (Sly's real life son) does a great job playing opposite his Dad. Director Rob Cohen has been in the industry for decades and has written produced and directed and he clearly has a handle on what entertains. No one will ever tell you Daylight is a brilliant piece of film making, its not even the most entertaining thing you'll ever see but is it good? Yes! and does it entertain? Absolutely! Everyone can enjoy this film because it has a great story, and might seem typical for a disaster flick but if that's your genre then you won't want to miss this movie because this is a 90's classic!! 8/10
