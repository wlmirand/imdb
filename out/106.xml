    The classic French thriller Diabolique has a sturdy story, which is one reason why it is a target for remakes. The film was remade for American television twice - first as Reflections of Murder (featuring Tuesday Weld, Joan Hackett and Sam Waterston) and later as House of Secrets (with Melissa Gilbert and Bruce Boxleitner). To be honest, both of those remakes are certainly interesting to watch, if lacking in the suspense and novelty of the original. Reflections is fairly faithful to its parent, while House of Secrets maintains the bare bones of the storyline and throws in a different setting and some elements of voodoo. If you have not seen the original, the enjoyment level of both those films will be elevated. The same cannot be said for the first dunderheaded attempt to cinematically remake the French classic for American audiences. Keeping the original name, story and setting would seem a step in the right direction, but the film fails due to some incredibly foolish choices. The action takes place at a private boys prep school overseen by the hateful Chazz Palminteri. In between stealing funds from the school, Palminteri enjoys subjecting wife Isabelle Adjani - who suffers from a weak heart - to assorted cruelties. In his spare time, he engages in S&M with ice queen blond teacher Sharon Stone. The two women - tired of his abuse - decide to murder him, drop his body in the disgustingly filthy school pool and make it appear that he drowned in a drunken accident. Naturally, nothing goes according to plan. The best thing about this film is probably the casting of Sharon Stone in the role made famous by French actress Simone Signoret. If anyone embodies some of the same cunning and sensuality of Signoret from the original in a modern actress, it would be Stone. Unfortunately, the screenplay and everything around her fails to support her in any way. The changes made to the screenplay are not improvements. While a remake need not be slavishly faithful to the original, it should not completely go off the beaten path the way that this film does, particularly in its finale. The shock twist ending of the original may no longer be fresh, but the shaggy dog pseudo-feminist tilt tacked on to this latest effort seems to come completely from left field and is a blatant misfire. If Stone was an inspired choice, the remainder of the cast is less so. Isabelle Adjani, looking puffy and listless, is completely underwhelming as the abused wife. At no point does she engage our sympathy and she often seems entirely too lacking in energy to be remotely terrified. This may well be the most laid-back "frightened" performance one has ever seen on celluloid. Kathy Bates shows up as a detective investigating Palmineri's disappearance and driving the women to distraction. Her performance is immensely enjoyable and she seems to be having a good time. As a cancer survivor, she gets to crack completely inappropriate jokes and attempts to lay the groundwork for the "we're all sisters under the skin" meme that creeps into the film's finale. Unfortunately, her character and performance belongs in a completely different (and one would argue better) film. And the casting of Chazz Palminteri as the abusive schoolmaster is a disaster. Palminteri, providing the same performance here as he does in his guise of the reliable Mafia hit man roles in which he specializes, is laughably miscast. As tough as he comes off, Adjani could arguably physically match him and Stone could step on him without blinking twice. Not only that, but we have to believe that there was something that attracted these two attractive women to him and kept them in his orbit when they could easily have moved on. Palminteri, resembling a large trout, and playing a man with the charisma of a barracuda, seems an impossible prospect for these women. We have to believe that one lovely woman would fall for him (much less two) and no gigantic leap of faith can make this happen. Director Jeremiah Chechik has absolutely no idea how to maintain suspense or an atmosphere of foreboding. The scene shifts are klutzy and obvious. The pacing is often laborious, which allows the viewer time to mull over the complexities of the plots and double-crosses played out before us and realize how absurd the entire scenario truly is - something that the original (as well as its TV remakes) never allowed the viewer time to contemplate. This material needs a skilled hand, but what is provided is a clumsy sledgehammer. The original is noted especially for its shock ending. This remake seems initially to be going for the same thing and then suddenly backtracks - with remorseless characters suddenly developing consciences and people conducting themselves in ways not previously indicated in their respective behavior. By the time all of the leads end up in a watery fight, one realizes what a foolish level to which the film has sunk. One is sternly advised to locate either the original French classic or one of its TV counterparts before descending to this entry.

    Someone recently said "Hollywood hates originality". This is the unfortunate evidence. I can only guess that the few favorable reviews came from people who never experienced the original film or were just too lazy to watch a film in a foreign language. Clouzot's effort was magnificent way back in the '50's. This was just a sad attempt at some fast bucks with no talent in front of or behind the camera. In the original film, the background of the school was seedy and cheap, the characters were unattractive in general and the surroundings were oppressive. This "sanitized" version misses the original point entirely. There was little or no suspense and no "atmosphere" at all. What a stupid waste. Ditto the remake of "Rear Window" but that's another review again... Curtis Stotlar

    **SPOILERS** Decent remake of the French 1955 film noir classic of the same title about two women, wife and mistress, planning the murder of their both sleazy and ape-like husband and lover that ends up boomeranging on both of them. In this modernized version of "Diabolique" the story takes place in Pennsylvania not France with headmistress and owner of an all boys private school Mia Baran, Isabelle Adjani, having her fill of taking all the abuse she can from her caveman like husband Guy, Chezz Palminteri. Mia gets together with Guy's also abused mistress, who got her left eye blackened by him, Nicole Horner played by an ultra sexy looking Sharon Stone who's also a teacher at the boys school. The two abused women plan to finally do away with the creep and make his death look like a drowning accident. It takes a while for the very Catholic observing Mia to agree to Nicole's plan to murder Guy but the way he treats her,like dirt, pushes her over the edge in willing to do him in. Luring Guy away from the boys school where he resides both Nicoel and Mia have him secretly travel to a friends home, the Danzingers, in Pittsburgh where they plan to murder him. It's there that Mia got the brutish Guy drunk, which wasn't that hard top do, on booze that was spiked with a number of strong sleeping pills. With Guy out cold the two dumped him into the bathtub and with the help of what looked like a ten gallon bottle filled with water,to keep him from floating to the surface, ended up drowning him. It's when back at the boys school when Nicole & Mia dumped the boozed and drugged up as well as dead Guy into the school swimming pool that strange things started to happen! Guy not only didn't go to the bottom he didn't even go to the top of the pool? In fact he just plumb disappeared from sight over or under the water line! The rest of the movie has Mia, the weaker of the two murderesses, slowly going to pieces in not only what she did in murdering her husband but far worse in not knowing where his body is in order to give it a decent Catholic burial! Going to the local police to have them track down her missing husband Mia is spotted by retired lady detective Shirley Vogel, Kathy Bates, who smells a big story and takes over the investigation in the missing Guy Barnan. ***SPOILERS*** It doesn't take long for Vogel to realized that something isn't exactly kosher in Guy's mysterious disappearance. Checking out all the facts Vogel finds out that Guy was embezzling the funds for the boys school and planning to bankrupt it in order to throw off suspicion on himself by the local police. What's even more interesting is that Guy's partner in crime was non other then Nicoe Horner! His mistress whom, as Vogel soon suspects, was very possibly his murderer as well! The unexpected and shocking final in the film in fact outdoes the original, the 1955 French version, with the truth coming to the surface in what was the real reason in murdering Guy and who were the one's who cooked it up in the first place! This was enough to give you, like one of the principle characters in the movie, an almost fatal heart attack! The fact that the intended victim of this elaborately planned scheme didn't end up dropping dead from fright turned out to be disastrous for those who planned it!

    I've read through many perspectives on this film, and one that seems to crop up time and again is the word 'camp.' Unfortunately, the film never establishes itself as camp, or indeed anything. It's pointless. There being little to add to the dissection of this film's problems, let's concentrate for a second on how a script this revolting gets made into a film this unsatisfying. Firstly, you have to have a screenwriter who really wants to make a point about how he understands the original. But another trait he has to have is that he doesn't think many other people understand the original. Then, you have to have him working with a culture he doesn't understand. How Sharon Stone got a job in a Catholic boarding school is amazing! Let alone how Palmintieri could stand over his dying wife, or how a boy could break through into the headmaster's quarters, witness the entire scene, and not be sent away. I had nine years in boarding school, and not once, thankfully, did I get to see my headmaster bare-chested. I can understand the chap's fascination with his naked language teacher, and it's very plausible he might find his way to a window to watch from a distance, but he must be the most intuitive, caring boy in the world to have grasped that something was very wrong - and then, if he had done so, he would have gone straight for that adult that Palmintieri has to tell him to go and find. Perhaps he is desperately in love with Miss Adjani. Whatever. Then you have two other awful, awful pieces of writing/casting. (a) the video team - straight out of the 'Titanic' school of cheeky-chappy enthusiasts who say dude all the time and really don't give a fiddler's toss about anything other than the geeky enjoyment their jobs bring them. This kind of embarrasiing stereotyping wiped at least a star off my rating of 'Lock, Stock' (the scousers) and it's just insulting to camera technicians everywhere. Hollywood's presentation of enthusiasts has often been has often been unkind in a 'let's laugh at them' kind of way; here,it's unwatchable. And (b) the other members of staff. You kind of wish the two girls could have chosen their victims more wisely. That would have made the ending much more acceptable. While they were about it, they could also have knocked off that bug-eyed monster whom someone has come back later on in order to introduce a "mystery" element with the sunglasses. Then, you MUST have a director who wants to refer back to the original with as many 'atmosphere shots' as he can find. Probably in homage to it, but again, with no real point. In the original, the dripping tap serves a purpose of heightening the atmosphere of tension. In this film, there IS no tension until right near the end, when KB is wandering through the garage. But why is she wandering through the garage? So the director can 'explain' where Palmintieri has been hiding all this time. By trying to do the original film homage while making his own point about what a great scriptwriter he is (is he?) or what a great director he is (is he?), the person or persons most responsible for this film, clearly told to cut down on the length of the original, never pauses long enough to let anything sink in. Thus the rhythm of the piece goes sideways. And I found myself thinking there must have been a moment during production when some studio heads said, "But, you see, we MUST have some violence, and a chase, some nudity and a sex scene." What began life as a vicious rape of his wife in the 50s classic becomes a ludicrous idea in this, effortlessly summarised by another reviewer here (thank you sir) as words to the effect of, "He terrorises and humiliates her so much that she has to shag him." I must say, though, Stone and Bates give class performances where and when they can - it's just Stone belongs in another film entirely, and Bates is given some classic quips but becomes a pawn in the filmmakers' race for the perfect, satisfying ending. Indeed, as other commentators have noted, halfway through they decide she is Columbo. "Just one more thing," she says, and I kid you not. Anyway, dears, the perfect, satisfying ending would have been for Bates to have locked everyone else in the school, including the scriptwriter and the director, and set fire to it. This film does nothing that you can't find in the French and Saunders videos on Youtube (try the classic "House of Idiot" or "Whatever Happened to Baby Dawn". Except embarrass you, appal you, and make you sick. But you know, there is a plus-side. The film ended!

    Character uses another to kill third one. Then the used character (always the less vicious and the more emotional) discovered the ugly truth of being used to serve hidden purposes for the first character and its hidden associate. Sometimes that associate could be the murdered party, sometimes the deceived could be a man or a woman, and many times it's from that deceived one's point of view. Since (Double Indemnity - 1944) this very formula in the Noir or the crime movies is so popular. Although there are endless ways to recycle and create through this old story, but most of the products along the years aren't excellent or even unpredictable. Based on a French movie or not, (Diabolique) isn't original or that good. It's even not convincing at places and rather idiot at others ! Since the whole thing is about killing the sick kind wife then why not to use less complicated ways? And if the husband is that sadistic deceitful why not to divorce him easily? And how oh how this husband brooked this amount of water for all of this time ? He must be Aquaman for god's sake ! Just like the gratuitous nudity here, the need for a lesbian relationship between the 2 women seemed for pure commercial purposes more than a dramatic motive (as a sexual tension between the 2 leads to make the audience hungry for love scene !). Yet, it's more powerful to watch (Stone) rescues (Adjani) at the end because she lastly felt the bound between them as 2 aggrieved women, not a "loving couple" where in this case the rescue becomes ordinary deed ?! Some of the situations looked so forced; such as the compulsory bad launch. Some of characters' reactions were so horribly bad; (Adjani) outrageously smiling among the professors at the lunch's table while she's supposed to be so sad and confused because of her husband's disappearance ! The intentions of (Kathy Bates)'s character were vague. There was no need for the character of the boy who peeks at his teacher nude ! Plus I didn't hear about a commercial that took this long to be filmed (clearly the 2 camera guys were living in the school for more than a week !??). The performance was truly laughable from (Isabelle Adjani)'s side. Along with being strangely not pretty sight this time, she dumbly was astounded, absentminded, sad, or scared all by the same goggled eyes ! Though she gave me so-provocative-it's-attractive acting to an extent that made the movie worth watching for a second time just for that ! I can't blame (Palmentieri) since the script dealt with him as a prototype scumbag. (Sharon Stone) did some fair acting; I think she was the only winner here. With a sluggish pace, and a story got no depth (for instance why it's a school, not a hotel ? a hospital ? or a company ??) you've got to ask yourself eventually why they didn't call it (scare your wife to death)?!, but Ah.. that could've ruined it. However with that ending it deserves a title like (treat women well otherwise they'll kill you) although it fits this story right but that could've ruined it too ! In fact the movie's finale makes it an explicit manifesto about how women, all the different kinds of women, CAN unite to kill one vile man and get away with it. So be aware of their anger because It's Woman Power baby ! A very sly notice : this movie came out one year after TV shows like Xena Warrior Princess (1995), and one year before another one : Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997).. I'll leave it to your intelligence to figure out the connections and what it could say about America of the mid-90s. However, in its core, all what the movie wanted is being a thriller with a different frame this time, to end up as one which's between average and poor despite the glow of it, especially with grand music, well cinematography, and interesting direction. To sum it all up I must tell : while it's a thrilling mystery this movie made me fall asleep in front of it. Sorry not that diabolic !

    The original here is one of the best thrillers, energetic in a way that distracts us from the revelation of the con. This is a lesser movie, but adds at least three clever ideas. If you are interested in narrative structure, you'll be interested in remakes of films and how they change. (I think these are changes to the original.) First, in true folding style, they added a film within the film. The film within is a recruiting film, but that hardly matters. Second, they changed the dynamic of the detective by making him a her. This allows for the third change but along the way the possibilities exist for the three types of women: the virgin, the whore and the shrew. It isn't played up well enough to matter, but its clear that someone's intuition was tuned. Third, there is a final twist that I think is quite different than the original's. It bonds the three women, already hinted in a lesbian tendency between the first two. But amazingly, the film didn't work well for me, probably because of pacing problems at various levels. Not that any level was off by the interplay of levels wasn't syncopated according to what engages. Its an intuitive process, I think, but quite rigid in its rules. Isabelle Adjani was cast perfectly, and introduced very skillfully. Beginnings are hard. This in its original incarnation was the first double con movie, I think. Adding a third was inevitable, I suppose. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.

    "Diabolique", a remake of the 1955 French horror/thriller "Les Diaboliques", centers on Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), a devout Catholic woman who is married to an abusive headmaster, Guy (Chazz Palminteri), with whom she runs an all boy's school. She is fairly close to his mistress, Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone), who is a teacher at the school, and the two conspire a plot to murder him. After the deed is done, they dispose of his body in the school's filthy swimming pool... but when the pool is drained, his body is gone, and strange things begin to haunt them, while a nosy detective (Kathy Bates) begins to catch onto the elaborate plot. To start off with, I consider the original "Les Diaboliques" one of the best horror movies of all time - it's painfully suspenseful, genuinely creepy, and has one of the best twist-endings I've ever seen. So, I went into this remake with fairly low expectations, and that may have been why I didn't mind it so much. I knew there was no possible way this re-imagining could out- do the original. So, with that said, I found this film to be a fairly entertaining thriller, even though I knew all the twists and turns of the plot ahead of time. The film takes place in modern day, but maintains a very 1950s feel, with the wardrobe and the old-fashioned architecture of the school. It's surprisingly pretty faithful to the original movie, too, with a few changes scattered about, some for the better and some for the worst. I thought the update of the murder scene was well executed, as was the climax of the film (again, even though I was aware of what to expect). However, as expected, we do have a very "Hollywood" ending - the movie follows the original closely until the last ten minutes, where the conclusion becomes what most American movie-goers would expect. I can't say it's necessarily that awful, and I wasn't expecting the writers to follow the cold, ambiguous conclusion the original had. I suppose I was a tad bit disappointed they didn't stick with the original ending, but what they did do with the new ending was clever. I'd say my biggest complaint here was the absence of ambiguity and suspense the original film upheld. The suspense was fairly secondhand in comparison, and I'd like to have seen improvement there. Acting-wise, I have mixed feelings. Sharon Stone, I felt, was fairly poor at times in her delivery and overall performance, while at other times she did quite well. Her performance was a bit topsy-turvy, but she was good enough, and does have the right 'look' for the part. Isabelle Adjani was great, she made her character very lovable, and her melancholy facial expressions were priceless. Chazz Palminteri was also good in the abusive, jerk-of-a-husband role. I also enjoyed Kathy Bates in the role of the detective, which was played by a male in the original. She's a great actress and played her quirky, offbeat role excellently. Overall, "Diabolique" is a bit of a mixed bag. I enjoyed it mainly because I found the re- imagining of the story an interesting idea, and the re-construction of some of those classic scenes was neat to watch. The problem with this film is if you see it before you see the 1955 version, you probably will enjoy it because the story and plot twists are really clever. However, if you've already seen the original, the story is essentially spoiled. I personally enjoyed watching the re-construction of it though, even with it's faults. I'd say this 1996 version of the story is a decent companion piece to the original - it's fairly entertaining, but can't hold a candle to the film it was based upon. 6/10.

    Mia is being abused by her husband Guy. It's too bad because Mia has heart problems. So her and her friend Nicole decide that Guy should have a little "accident." So they work together but Mia is all nervous and tense but Nicole is cool. Then they drain the pond and Mia starts to freak out. I keep thinking, "what is going on?" I really don't know if he is dead or alive or if someone pulled him out. Then I got to the end and I wasn't surprised because I had that idea in my head too. I couldn't really figure out whose side was whose. Where Mia and Nicole still working together? Then there is that detective with one breast that I thought that was involved but forget that. Forget this whole movie because it's way too confusing.

    I heard some really bad things about this remake of the classic French film 'Les Diaboliques', and I would never have expected it to be a patch on the brilliant original anyway; the only reason I even bothered to watch it is because it happened to be on TV, and there happened to be nothing else on. However, after the first half hour or so; while the film indeed is nothing on the original, it seemed like it was going to end up being a decent thriller. But then the problems start; the parts where the original's character reflected on what they'd done were the best parts of the film; here they're extremely boring, and that's where the film falls down. The plot is basically the same as the original and focuses on a school which is ran by a man with a wife and a mistress; neither of which like him. They decide that killing him would be a great idea, and promptly do it. However, after disposing of the body in the school swimming pool and later having it emptied; the body isn't there! And what's worse is that the women start to find clues that he may still be alive... It's a real shame that this film wasn't better as the two female leads are excellent. I'm not sure that I would have made it all the way to the end if it wasn't for the fact that I had the beautiful Isabelle Adjani to admire. It's not her greatest performance and she seems to be on autopilot, but she fits into the scared mousy role well. She is joined by Sharon Stone, who is brilliantly cast as Adjani's colder and more collected opposite number. Stone also looks good, which is certainly a bonus considering the shortcomings of the rest of the film. The problem with the second half of the film is really that it's not interesting, and there aren't enough other things going on to make up for it. There's a hint of a lesbian relationship between the two leads, though nothing really comes of it; definitely a big mistake considering how great they both look! Having already seen the original, the ending came as no surprise; but I'm certain that I could have guessed anyway as there soon becomes only one way that it can go. Overall, I could probably watch Isabelle Adjani all day long; but not when the film in question is this one. There's not much point bothering with this...see the original instead.

    Diabolique is set in Pennsylvania at the St. Anselm's boarding school for boys which is owned by Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), however her husband Guy (Chazz Palminteri) who runs the school treats her like dirt & cheats on her. Mia & a teacher named Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone) whom is one of Guy's many lovers devise a plan to kill him & make it look like an accident, the plan is to drown him & then throw him in the school pool where he will be found & to the police his death will seem like a simple drowning. However after a few days the body isn't found so Mia orders the dirty pool drained when Nicole 'accidently' drops her keys into it, once drained Guy's body is not there. Was Guy dead? Did someone find out there plan? Who knows... Directed by Jeremiah Chechik this is a remake of the black and white French film Les Diaboliques (1955) which itself was based on the novel 'Celle Qui N'Etait Plus' by Pierre Boileau & Thomas Narcejac & I thought was a fairly lazy & plodding mystery thriller with truly one of the worst twist endings ever. The humourless & slow moving script by Don Ross takes ages to do what the average episode of Columbo took about 10 minutes to, to show someone committing the so-called perfect murder. Then it switches to creepy thriller mode as the body vanishes from where the murderers left it & seemingly has come back to life before it all falls apart with one of the worst, most predictable & frankly unlikable twist endings ever. I can't continue my review any further without massive spoilers which will give away the ending so beware, anyway I hate the fact that Mia & Nicole suddenly turn into the heroes of the piece when they were just as bad as Guy since in the case of Mia she planned to kill him in cold blood & Nicole was prepared to trick Mia & ultimately kill her if the plan had succeeded. They were really unlikable character's to begin with so this horrible ending where they become the heroes by killing Guy which is basically exactly the same thing which they set out to do in the first place just grated my nerves. Also, if Mia was feeling so guilty why did she seem almost redeemed at the end? She still ended up killing Guy anyway so why the miraculous change of heart? Also, what about Nicole? She still was part of some scheme where someone was always going to die, be it either Mia or Guy. The ending is just so misjudged, it makes no sense with the rest of the context of the film, it's horribly acted & it's utterly predictable. In fact I guessed how this would end within 30 minutes & I was absolutely right in just about every detail. A really horrible film with an even worse ending, one to avoid. Director Chechik has made some really, really awful films & after this mess & his subsequent big screen adaptation of The Avengers (1998) which is considered one of the worst films ever made Hollywood thankfully hasn't let him anywhere near a film camera since. This guy should be directing traffic rather than films. This is blandly shot in dull autumnal colours which give it forgettable look. I also have to mention the acting, especially by the two female leads Stone & Adjani who are simply terrible. I hated their character's, I hated their acting & thought they were two of the worst performances by leading actors in a Hollywood flick I've ever seen. In the UK this is rated '18' meaning no-one under that age can watch it, I have no idea why as there's no violence worth mentioning, no nudity or sex & it's devoid of any action or excitement. Technically the film is alright but it's flat, dull & blandly filmed. There's no real style here & it's not a film I will remember in any way apart from that terrible ending. As I've said I think the acting by the two leads is simply awful. Diaboliques is a slow moving, utterly predictable thriller with a horrible ending that didn't do anything for me. One to avoid. This probably would have worked better as a 30 minute Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode or maybe even as an obscure black and white French film from the 50's...

    The classic French thriller Diabolique has a sturdy story, which is one reason why it is a target for remakes. The film was remade for American television twice - first as Reflections of Murder (featuring Tuesday Weld, Joan Hackett and Sam Waterston) and later as House of Secrets (with Melissa Gilbert and Bruce Boxleitner). To be honest, both of those remakes are certainly interesting to watch, if lacking in the suspense and novelty of the original. Reflections is fairly faithful to its parent, while House of Secrets maintains the bare bones of the storyline and throws in a different setting and some elements of voodoo. If you have not seen the original, the enjoyment level of both those films will be elevated. The same cannot be said for the first dunderheaded attempt to cinematically remake the French classic for American audiences. Keeping the original name, story and setting would seem a step in the right direction, but the film fails due to some incredibly foolish choices. The action takes place at a private boys prep school overseen by the hateful Chazz Palminteri. In between stealing funds from the school, Palminteri enjoys subjecting wife Isabelle Adjani - who suffers from a weak heart - to assorted cruelties. In his spare time, he engages in S&M with ice queen blond teacher Sharon Stone. The two women - tired of his abuse - decide to murder him, drop his body in the disgustingly filthy school pool and make it appear that he drowned in a drunken accident. Naturally, nothing goes according to plan. The best thing about this film is probably the casting of Sharon Stone in the role made famous by French actress Simone Signoret. If anyone embodies some of the same cunning and sensuality of Signoret from the original in a modern actress, it would be Stone. Unfortunately, the screenplay and everything around her fails to support her in any way. The changes made to the screenplay are not improvements. While a remake need not be slavishly faithful to the original, it should not completely go off the beaten path the way that this film does, particularly in its finale. The shock twist ending of the original may no longer be fresh, but the shaggy dog pseudo-feminist tilt tacked on to this latest effort seems to come completely from left field and is a blatant misfire. If Stone was an inspired choice, the remainder of the cast is less so. Isabelle Adjani, looking puffy and listless, is completely underwhelming as the abused wife. At no point does she engage our sympathy and she often seems entirely too lacking in energy to be remotely terrified. This may well be the most laid-back "frightened" performance one has ever seen on celluloid. Kathy Bates shows up as a detective investigating Palmineri's disappearance and driving the women to distraction. Her performance is immensely enjoyable and she seems to be having a good time. As a cancer survivor, she gets to crack completely inappropriate jokes and attempts to lay the groundwork for the "we're all sisters under the skin" meme that creeps into the film's finale. Unfortunately, her character and performance belongs in a completely different (and one would argue better) film. And the casting of Chazz Palminteri as the abusive schoolmaster is a disaster. Palminteri, providing the same performance here as he does in his guise of the reliable Mafia hit man roles in which he specializes, is laughably miscast. As tough as he comes off, Adjani could arguably physically match him and Stone could step on him without blinking twice. Not only that, but we have to believe that there was something that attracted these two attractive women to him and kept them in his orbit when they could easily have moved on. Palminteri, resembling a large trout, and playing a man with the charisma of a barracuda, seems an impossible prospect for these women. We have to believe that one lovely woman would fall for him (much less two) and no gigantic leap of faith can make this happen. Director Jeremiah Chechik has absolutely no idea how to maintain suspense or an atmosphere of foreboding. The scene shifts are klutzy and obvious. The pacing is often laborious, which allows the viewer time to mull over the complexities of the plots and double-crosses played out before us and realize how absurd the entire scenario truly is - something that the original (as well as its TV remakes) never allowed the viewer time to contemplate. This material needs a skilled hand, but what is provided is a clumsy sledgehammer. The original is noted especially for its shock ending. This remake seems initially to be going for the same thing and then suddenly backtracks - with remorseless characters suddenly developing consciences and people conducting themselves in ways not previously indicated in their respective behavior. By the time all of the leads end up in a watery fight, one realizes what a foolish level to which the film has sunk. One is sternly advised to locate either the original French classic or one of its TV counterparts before descending to this entry.

    Someone recently said "Hollywood hates originality". This is the unfortunate evidence. I can only guess that the few favorable reviews came from people who never experienced the original film or were just too lazy to watch a film in a foreign language. Clouzot's effort was magnificent way back in the '50's. This was just a sad attempt at some fast bucks with no talent in front of or behind the camera. In the original film, the background of the school was seedy and cheap, the characters were unattractive in general and the surroundings were oppressive. This "sanitized" version misses the original point entirely. There was little or no suspense and no "atmosphere" at all. What a stupid waste. Ditto the remake of "Rear Window" but that's another review again... Curtis Stotlar

    **SPOILERS** Decent remake of the French 1955 film noir classic of the same title about two women, wife and mistress, planning the murder of their both sleazy and ape-like husband and lover that ends up boomeranging on both of them. In this modernized version of "Diabolique" the story takes place in Pennsylvania not France with headmistress and owner of an all boys private school Mia Baran, Isabelle Adjani, having her fill of taking all the abuse she can from her caveman like husband Guy, Chezz Palminteri. Mia gets together with Guy's also abused mistress, who got her left eye blackened by him, Nicole Horner played by an ultra sexy looking Sharon Stone who's also a teacher at the boys school. The two abused women plan to finally do away with the creep and make his death look like a drowning accident. It takes a while for the very Catholic observing Mia to agree to Nicole's plan to murder Guy but the way he treats her,like dirt, pushes her over the edge in willing to do him in. Luring Guy away from the boys school where he resides both Nicoel and Mia have him secretly travel to a friends home, the Danzingers, in Pittsburgh where they plan to murder him. It's there that Mia got the brutish Guy drunk, which wasn't that hard top do, on booze that was spiked with a number of strong sleeping pills. With Guy out cold the two dumped him into the bathtub and with the help of what looked like a ten gallon bottle filled with water,to keep him from floating to the surface, ended up drowning him. It's when back at the boys school when Nicole & Mia dumped the boozed and drugged up as well as dead Guy into the school swimming pool that strange things started to happen! Guy not only didn't go to the bottom he didn't even go to the top of the pool? In fact he just plumb disappeared from sight over or under the water line! The rest of the movie has Mia, the weaker of the two murderesses, slowly going to pieces in not only what she did in murdering her husband but far worse in not knowing where his body is in order to give it a decent Catholic burial! Going to the local police to have them track down her missing husband Mia is spotted by retired lady detective Shirley Vogel, Kathy Bates, who smells a big story and takes over the investigation in the missing Guy Barnan. ***SPOILERS*** It doesn't take long for Vogel to realized that something isn't exactly kosher in Guy's mysterious disappearance. Checking out all the facts Vogel finds out that Guy was embezzling the funds for the boys school and planning to bankrupt it in order to throw off suspicion on himself by the local police. What's even more interesting is that Guy's partner in crime was non other then Nicoe Horner! His mistress whom, as Vogel soon suspects, was very possibly his murderer as well! The unexpected and shocking final in the film in fact outdoes the original, the 1955 French version, with the truth coming to the surface in what was the real reason in murdering Guy and who were the one's who cooked it up in the first place! This was enough to give you, like one of the principle characters in the movie, an almost fatal heart attack! The fact that the intended victim of this elaborately planned scheme didn't end up dropping dead from fright turned out to be disastrous for those who planned it!

    I've read through many perspectives on this film, and one that seems to crop up time and again is the word 'camp.' Unfortunately, the film never establishes itself as camp, or indeed anything. It's pointless. There being little to add to the dissection of this film's problems, let's concentrate for a second on how a script this revolting gets made into a film this unsatisfying. Firstly, you have to have a screenwriter who really wants to make a point about how he understands the original. But another trait he has to have is that he doesn't think many other people understand the original. Then, you have to have him working with a culture he doesn't understand. How Sharon Stone got a job in a Catholic boarding school is amazing! Let alone how Palmintieri could stand over his dying wife, or how a boy could break through into the headmaster's quarters, witness the entire scene, and not be sent away. I had nine years in boarding school, and not once, thankfully, did I get to see my headmaster bare-chested. I can understand the chap's fascination with his naked language teacher, and it's very plausible he might find his way to a window to watch from a distance, but he must be the most intuitive, caring boy in the world to have grasped that something was very wrong - and then, if he had done so, he would have gone straight for that adult that Palmintieri has to tell him to go and find. Perhaps he is desperately in love with Miss Adjani. Whatever. Then you have two other awful, awful pieces of writing/casting. (a) the video team - straight out of the 'Titanic' school of cheeky-chappy enthusiasts who say dude all the time and really don't give a fiddler's toss about anything other than the geeky enjoyment their jobs bring them. This kind of embarrasiing stereotyping wiped at least a star off my rating of 'Lock, Stock' (the scousers) and it's just insulting to camera technicians everywhere. Hollywood's presentation of enthusiasts has often been has often been unkind in a 'let's laugh at them' kind of way; here,it's unwatchable. And (b) the other members of staff. You kind of wish the two girls could have chosen their victims more wisely. That would have made the ending much more acceptable. While they were about it, they could also have knocked off that bug-eyed monster whom someone has come back later on in order to introduce a "mystery" element with the sunglasses. Then, you MUST have a director who wants to refer back to the original with as many 'atmosphere shots' as he can find. Probably in homage to it, but again, with no real point. In the original, the dripping tap serves a purpose of heightening the atmosphere of tension. In this film, there IS no tension until right near the end, when KB is wandering through the garage. But why is she wandering through the garage? So the director can 'explain' where Palmintieri has been hiding all this time. By trying to do the original film homage while making his own point about what a great scriptwriter he is (is he?) or what a great director he is (is he?), the person or persons most responsible for this film, clearly told to cut down on the length of the original, never pauses long enough to let anything sink in. Thus the rhythm of the piece goes sideways. And I found myself thinking there must have been a moment during production when some studio heads said, "But, you see, we MUST have some violence, and a chase, some nudity and a sex scene." What began life as a vicious rape of his wife in the 50s classic becomes a ludicrous idea in this, effortlessly summarised by another reviewer here (thank you sir) as words to the effect of, "He terrorises and humiliates her so much that she has to shag him." I must say, though, Stone and Bates give class performances where and when they can - it's just Stone belongs in another film entirely, and Bates is given some classic quips but becomes a pawn in the filmmakers' race for the perfect, satisfying ending. Indeed, as other commentators have noted, halfway through they decide she is Columbo. "Just one more thing," she says, and I kid you not. Anyway, dears, the perfect, satisfying ending would have been for Bates to have locked everyone else in the school, including the scriptwriter and the director, and set fire to it. This film does nothing that you can't find in the French and Saunders videos on Youtube (try the classic "House of Idiot" or "Whatever Happened to Baby Dawn". Except embarrass you, appal you, and make you sick. But you know, there is a plus-side. The film ended!

    Character uses another to kill third one. Then the used character (always the less vicious and the more emotional) discovered the ugly truth of being used to serve hidden purposes for the first character and its hidden associate. Sometimes that associate could be the murdered party, sometimes the deceived could be a man or a woman, and many times it's from that deceived one's point of view. Since (Double Indemnity - 1944) this very formula in the Noir or the crime movies is so popular. Although there are endless ways to recycle and create through this old story, but most of the products along the years aren't excellent or even unpredictable. Based on a French movie or not, (Diabolique) isn't original or that good. It's even not convincing at places and rather idiot at others ! Since the whole thing is about killing the sick kind wife then why not to use less complicated ways? And if the husband is that sadistic deceitful why not to divorce him easily? And how oh how this husband brooked this amount of water for all of this time ? He must be Aquaman for god's sake ! Just like the gratuitous nudity here, the need for a lesbian relationship between the 2 women seemed for pure commercial purposes more than a dramatic motive (as a sexual tension between the 2 leads to make the audience hungry for love scene !). Yet, it's more powerful to watch (Stone) rescues (Adjani) at the end because she lastly felt the bound between them as 2 aggrieved women, not a "loving couple" where in this case the rescue becomes ordinary deed ?! Some of the situations looked so forced; such as the compulsory bad launch. Some of characters' reactions were so horribly bad; (Adjani) outrageously smiling among the professors at the lunch's table while she's supposed to be so sad and confused because of her husband's disappearance ! The intentions of (Kathy Bates)'s character were vague. There was no need for the character of the boy who peeks at his teacher nude ! Plus I didn't hear about a commercial that took this long to be filmed (clearly the 2 camera guys were living in the school for more than a week !??). The performance was truly laughable from (Isabelle Adjani)'s side. Along with being strangely not pretty sight this time, she dumbly was astounded, absentminded, sad, or scared all by the same goggled eyes ! Though she gave me so-provocative-it's-attractive acting to an extent that made the movie worth watching for a second time just for that ! I can't blame (Palmentieri) since the script dealt with him as a prototype scumbag. (Sharon Stone) did some fair acting; I think she was the only winner here. With a sluggish pace, and a story got no depth (for instance why it's a school, not a hotel ? a hospital ? or a company ??) you've got to ask yourself eventually why they didn't call it (scare your wife to death)?!, but Ah.. that could've ruined it. However with that ending it deserves a title like (treat women well otherwise they'll kill you) although it fits this story right but that could've ruined it too ! In fact the movie's finale makes it an explicit manifesto about how women, all the different kinds of women, CAN unite to kill one vile man and get away with it. So be aware of their anger because It's Woman Power baby ! A very sly notice : this movie came out one year after TV shows like Xena Warrior Princess (1995), and one year before another one : Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997).. I'll leave it to your intelligence to figure out the connections and what it could say about America of the mid-90s. However, in its core, all what the movie wanted is being a thriller with a different frame this time, to end up as one which's between average and poor despite the glow of it, especially with grand music, well cinematography, and interesting direction. To sum it all up I must tell : while it's a thrilling mystery this movie made me fall asleep in front of it. Sorry not that diabolic !

    The original here is one of the best thrillers, energetic in a way that distracts us from the revelation of the con. This is a lesser movie, but adds at least three clever ideas. If you are interested in narrative structure, you'll be interested in remakes of films and how they change. (I think these are changes to the original.) First, in true folding style, they added a film within the film. The film within is a recruiting film, but that hardly matters. Second, they changed the dynamic of the detective by making him a her. This allows for the third change but along the way the possibilities exist for the three types of women: the virgin, the whore and the shrew. It isn't played up well enough to matter, but its clear that someone's intuition was tuned. Third, there is a final twist that I think is quite different than the original's. It bonds the three women, already hinted in a lesbian tendency between the first two. But amazingly, the film didn't work well for me, probably because of pacing problems at various levels. Not that any level was off by the interplay of levels wasn't syncopated according to what engages. Its an intuitive process, I think, but quite rigid in its rules. Isabelle Adjani was cast perfectly, and introduced very skillfully. Beginnings are hard. This in its original incarnation was the first double con movie, I think. Adding a third was inevitable, I suppose. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.

    "Diabolique", a remake of the 1955 French horror/thriller "Les Diaboliques", centers on Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), a devout Catholic woman who is married to an abusive headmaster, Guy (Chazz Palminteri), with whom she runs an all boy's school. She is fairly close to his mistress, Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone), who is a teacher at the school, and the two conspire a plot to murder him. After the deed is done, they dispose of his body in the school's filthy swimming pool... but when the pool is drained, his body is gone, and strange things begin to haunt them, while a nosy detective (Kathy Bates) begins to catch onto the elaborate plot. To start off with, I consider the original "Les Diaboliques" one of the best horror movies of all time - it's painfully suspenseful, genuinely creepy, and has one of the best twist-endings I've ever seen. So, I went into this remake with fairly low expectations, and that may have been why I didn't mind it so much. I knew there was no possible way this re-imagining could out- do the original. So, with that said, I found this film to be a fairly entertaining thriller, even though I knew all the twists and turns of the plot ahead of time. The film takes place in modern day, but maintains a very 1950s feel, with the wardrobe and the old-fashioned architecture of the school. It's surprisingly pretty faithful to the original movie, too, with a few changes scattered about, some for the better and some for the worst. I thought the update of the murder scene was well executed, as was the climax of the film (again, even though I was aware of what to expect). However, as expected, we do have a very "Hollywood" ending - the movie follows the original closely until the last ten minutes, where the conclusion becomes what most American movie-goers would expect. I can't say it's necessarily that awful, and I wasn't expecting the writers to follow the cold, ambiguous conclusion the original had. I suppose I was a tad bit disappointed they didn't stick with the original ending, but what they did do with the new ending was clever. I'd say my biggest complaint here was the absence of ambiguity and suspense the original film upheld. The suspense was fairly secondhand in comparison, and I'd like to have seen improvement there. Acting-wise, I have mixed feelings. Sharon Stone, I felt, was fairly poor at times in her delivery and overall performance, while at other times she did quite well. Her performance was a bit topsy-turvy, but she was good enough, and does have the right 'look' for the part. Isabelle Adjani was great, she made her character very lovable, and her melancholy facial expressions were priceless. Chazz Palminteri was also good in the abusive, jerk-of-a-husband role. I also enjoyed Kathy Bates in the role of the detective, which was played by a male in the original. She's a great actress and played her quirky, offbeat role excellently. Overall, "Diabolique" is a bit of a mixed bag. I enjoyed it mainly because I found the re- imagining of the story an interesting idea, and the re-construction of some of those classic scenes was neat to watch. The problem with this film is if you see it before you see the 1955 version, you probably will enjoy it because the story and plot twists are really clever. However, if you've already seen the original, the story is essentially spoiled. I personally enjoyed watching the re-construction of it though, even with it's faults. I'd say this 1996 version of the story is a decent companion piece to the original - it's fairly entertaining, but can't hold a candle to the film it was based upon. 6/10.

    Mia is being abused by her husband Guy. It's too bad because Mia has heart problems. So her and her friend Nicole decide that Guy should have a little "accident." So they work together but Mia is all nervous and tense but Nicole is cool. Then they drain the pond and Mia starts to freak out. I keep thinking, "what is going on?" I really don't know if he is dead or alive or if someone pulled him out. Then I got to the end and I wasn't surprised because I had that idea in my head too. I couldn't really figure out whose side was whose. Where Mia and Nicole still working together? Then there is that detective with one breast that I thought that was involved but forget that. Forget this whole movie because it's way too confusing.

    I heard some really bad things about this remake of the classic French film 'Les Diaboliques', and I would never have expected it to be a patch on the brilliant original anyway; the only reason I even bothered to watch it is because it happened to be on TV, and there happened to be nothing else on. However, after the first half hour or so; while the film indeed is nothing on the original, it seemed like it was going to end up being a decent thriller. But then the problems start; the parts where the original's character reflected on what they'd done were the best parts of the film; here they're extremely boring, and that's where the film falls down. The plot is basically the same as the original and focuses on a school which is ran by a man with a wife and a mistress; neither of which like him. They decide that killing him would be a great idea, and promptly do it. However, after disposing of the body in the school swimming pool and later having it emptied; the body isn't there! And what's worse is that the women start to find clues that he may still be alive... It's a real shame that this film wasn't better as the two female leads are excellent. I'm not sure that I would have made it all the way to the end if it wasn't for the fact that I had the beautiful Isabelle Adjani to admire. It's not her greatest performance and she seems to be on autopilot, but she fits into the scared mousy role well. She is joined by Sharon Stone, who is brilliantly cast as Adjani's colder and more collected opposite number. Stone also looks good, which is certainly a bonus considering the shortcomings of the rest of the film. The problem with the second half of the film is really that it's not interesting, and there aren't enough other things going on to make up for it. There's a hint of a lesbian relationship between the two leads, though nothing really comes of it; definitely a big mistake considering how great they both look! Having already seen the original, the ending came as no surprise; but I'm certain that I could have guessed anyway as there soon becomes only one way that it can go. Overall, I could probably watch Isabelle Adjani all day long; but not when the film in question is this one. There's not much point bothering with this...see the original instead.

    Diabolique is set in Pennsylvania at the St. Anselm's boarding school for boys which is owned by Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), however her husband Guy (Chazz Palminteri) who runs the school treats her like dirt & cheats on her. Mia & a teacher named Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone) whom is one of Guy's many lovers devise a plan to kill him & make it look like an accident, the plan is to drown him & then throw him in the school pool where he will be found & to the police his death will seem like a simple drowning. However after a few days the body isn't found so Mia orders the dirty pool drained when Nicole 'accidently' drops her keys into it, once drained Guy's body is not there. Was Guy dead? Did someone find out there plan? Who knows... Directed by Jeremiah Chechik this is a remake of the black and white French film Les Diaboliques (1955) which itself was based on the novel 'Celle Qui N'Etait Plus' by Pierre Boileau & Thomas Narcejac & I thought was a fairly lazy & plodding mystery thriller with truly one of the worst twist endings ever. The humourless & slow moving script by Don Ross takes ages to do what the average episode of Columbo took about 10 minutes to, to show someone committing the so-called perfect murder. Then it switches to creepy thriller mode as the body vanishes from where the murderers left it & seemingly has come back to life before it all falls apart with one of the worst, most predictable & frankly unlikable twist endings ever. I can't continue my review any further without massive spoilers which will give away the ending so beware, anyway I hate the fact that Mia & Nicole suddenly turn into the heroes of the piece when they were just as bad as Guy since in the case of Mia she planned to kill him in cold blood & Nicole was prepared to trick Mia & ultimately kill her if the plan had succeeded. They were really unlikable character's to begin with so this horrible ending where they become the heroes by killing Guy which is basically exactly the same thing which they set out to do in the first place just grated my nerves. Also, if Mia was feeling so guilty why did she seem almost redeemed at the end? She still ended up killing Guy anyway so why the miraculous change of heart? Also, what about Nicole? She still was part of some scheme where someone was always going to die, be it either Mia or Guy. The ending is just so misjudged, it makes no sense with the rest of the context of the film, it's horribly acted & it's utterly predictable. In fact I guessed how this would end within 30 minutes & I was absolutely right in just about every detail. A really horrible film with an even worse ending, one to avoid. Director Chechik has made some really, really awful films & after this mess & his subsequent big screen adaptation of The Avengers (1998) which is considered one of the worst films ever made Hollywood thankfully hasn't let him anywhere near a film camera since. This guy should be directing traffic rather than films. This is blandly shot in dull autumnal colours which give it forgettable look. I also have to mention the acting, especially by the two female leads Stone & Adjani who are simply terrible. I hated their character's, I hated their acting & thought they were two of the worst performances by leading actors in a Hollywood flick I've ever seen. In the UK this is rated '18' meaning no-one under that age can watch it, I have no idea why as there's no violence worth mentioning, no nudity or sex & it's devoid of any action or excitement. Technically the film is alright but it's flat, dull & blandly filmed. There's no real style here & it's not a film I will remember in any way apart from that terrible ending. As I've said I think the acting by the two leads is simply awful. Diaboliques is a slow moving, utterly predictable thriller with a horrible ending that didn't do anything for me. One to avoid. This probably would have worked better as a 30 minute Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode or maybe even as an obscure black and white French film from the 50's...

    The classic French thriller Diabolique has a sturdy story, which is one reason why it is a target for remakes. The film was remade for American television twice - first as Reflections of Murder (featuring Tuesday Weld, Joan Hackett and Sam Waterston) and later as House of Secrets (with Melissa Gilbert and Bruce Boxleitner). To be honest, both of those remakes are certainly interesting to watch, if lacking in the suspense and novelty of the original. Reflections is fairly faithful to its parent, while House of Secrets maintains the bare bones of the storyline and throws in a different setting and some elements of voodoo. If you have not seen the original, the enjoyment level of both those films will be elevated. The same cannot be said for the first dunderheaded attempt to cinematically remake the French classic for American audiences. Keeping the original name, story and setting would seem a step in the right direction, but the film fails due to some incredibly foolish choices. The action takes place at a private boys prep school overseen by the hateful Chazz Palminteri. In between stealing funds from the school, Palminteri enjoys subjecting wife Isabelle Adjani - who suffers from a weak heart - to assorted cruelties. In his spare time, he engages in S&M with ice queen blond teacher Sharon Stone. The two women - tired of his abuse - decide to murder him, drop his body in the disgustingly filthy school pool and make it appear that he drowned in a drunken accident. Naturally, nothing goes according to plan. The best thing about this film is probably the casting of Sharon Stone in the role made famous by French actress Simone Signoret. If anyone embodies some of the same cunning and sensuality of Signoret from the original in a modern actress, it would be Stone. Unfortunately, the screenplay and everything around her fails to support her in any way. The changes made to the screenplay are not improvements. While a remake need not be slavishly faithful to the original, it should not completely go off the beaten path the way that this film does, particularly in its finale. The shock twist ending of the original may no longer be fresh, but the shaggy dog pseudo-feminist tilt tacked on to this latest effort seems to come completely from left field and is a blatant misfire. If Stone was an inspired choice, the remainder of the cast is less so. Isabelle Adjani, looking puffy and listless, is completely underwhelming as the abused wife. At no point does she engage our sympathy and she often seems entirely too lacking in energy to be remotely terrified. This may well be the most laid-back "frightened" performance one has ever seen on celluloid. Kathy Bates shows up as a detective investigating Palmineri's disappearance and driving the women to distraction. Her performance is immensely enjoyable and she seems to be having a good time. As a cancer survivor, she gets to crack completely inappropriate jokes and attempts to lay the groundwork for the "we're all sisters under the skin" meme that creeps into the film's finale. Unfortunately, her character and performance belongs in a completely different (and one would argue better) film. And the casting of Chazz Palminteri as the abusive schoolmaster is a disaster. Palminteri, providing the same performance here as he does in his guise of the reliable Mafia hit man roles in which he specializes, is laughably miscast. As tough as he comes off, Adjani could arguably physically match him and Stone could step on him without blinking twice. Not only that, but we have to believe that there was something that attracted these two attractive women to him and kept them in his orbit when they could easily have moved on. Palminteri, resembling a large trout, and playing a man with the charisma of a barracuda, seems an impossible prospect for these women. We have to believe that one lovely woman would fall for him (much less two) and no gigantic leap of faith can make this happen. Director Jeremiah Chechik has absolutely no idea how to maintain suspense or an atmosphere of foreboding. The scene shifts are klutzy and obvious. The pacing is often laborious, which allows the viewer time to mull over the complexities of the plots and double-crosses played out before us and realize how absurd the entire scenario truly is - something that the original (as well as its TV remakes) never allowed the viewer time to contemplate. This material needs a skilled hand, but what is provided is a clumsy sledgehammer. The original is noted especially for its shock ending. This remake seems initially to be going for the same thing and then suddenly backtracks - with remorseless characters suddenly developing consciences and people conducting themselves in ways not previously indicated in their respective behavior. By the time all of the leads end up in a watery fight, one realizes what a foolish level to which the film has sunk. One is sternly advised to locate either the original French classic or one of its TV counterparts before descending to this entry.

    Someone recently said "Hollywood hates originality". This is the unfortunate evidence. I can only guess that the few favorable reviews came from people who never experienced the original film or were just too lazy to watch a film in a foreign language. Clouzot's effort was magnificent way back in the '50's. This was just a sad attempt at some fast bucks with no talent in front of or behind the camera. In the original film, the background of the school was seedy and cheap, the characters were unattractive in general and the surroundings were oppressive. This "sanitized" version misses the original point entirely. There was little or no suspense and no "atmosphere" at all. What a stupid waste. Ditto the remake of "Rear Window" but that's another review again... Curtis Stotlar

    **SPOILERS** Decent remake of the French 1955 film noir classic of the same title about two women, wife and mistress, planning the murder of their both sleazy and ape-like husband and lover that ends up boomeranging on both of them. In this modernized version of "Diabolique" the story takes place in Pennsylvania not France with headmistress and owner of an all boys private school Mia Baran, Isabelle Adjani, having her fill of taking all the abuse she can from her caveman like husband Guy, Chezz Palminteri. Mia gets together with Guy's also abused mistress, who got her left eye blackened by him, Nicole Horner played by an ultra sexy looking Sharon Stone who's also a teacher at the boys school. The two abused women plan to finally do away with the creep and make his death look like a drowning accident. It takes a while for the very Catholic observing Mia to agree to Nicole's plan to murder Guy but the way he treats her,like dirt, pushes her over the edge in willing to do him in. Luring Guy away from the boys school where he resides both Nicoel and Mia have him secretly travel to a friends home, the Danzingers, in Pittsburgh where they plan to murder him. It's there that Mia got the brutish Guy drunk, which wasn't that hard top do, on booze that was spiked with a number of strong sleeping pills. With Guy out cold the two dumped him into the bathtub and with the help of what looked like a ten gallon bottle filled with water,to keep him from floating to the surface, ended up drowning him. It's when back at the boys school when Nicole & Mia dumped the boozed and drugged up as well as dead Guy into the school swimming pool that strange things started to happen! Guy not only didn't go to the bottom he didn't even go to the top of the pool? In fact he just plumb disappeared from sight over or under the water line! The rest of the movie has Mia, the weaker of the two murderesses, slowly going to pieces in not only what she did in murdering her husband but far worse in not knowing where his body is in order to give it a decent Catholic burial! Going to the local police to have them track down her missing husband Mia is spotted by retired lady detective Shirley Vogel, Kathy Bates, who smells a big story and takes over the investigation in the missing Guy Barnan. ***SPOILERS*** It doesn't take long for Vogel to realized that something isn't exactly kosher in Guy's mysterious disappearance. Checking out all the facts Vogel finds out that Guy was embezzling the funds for the boys school and planning to bankrupt it in order to throw off suspicion on himself by the local police. What's even more interesting is that Guy's partner in crime was non other then Nicoe Horner! His mistress whom, as Vogel soon suspects, was very possibly his murderer as well! The unexpected and shocking final in the film in fact outdoes the original, the 1955 French version, with the truth coming to the surface in what was the real reason in murdering Guy and who were the one's who cooked it up in the first place! This was enough to give you, like one of the principle characters in the movie, an almost fatal heart attack! The fact that the intended victim of this elaborately planned scheme didn't end up dropping dead from fright turned out to be disastrous for those who planned it!

    I've read through many perspectives on this film, and one that seems to crop up time and again is the word 'camp.' Unfortunately, the film never establishes itself as camp, or indeed anything. It's pointless. There being little to add to the dissection of this film's problems, let's concentrate for a second on how a script this revolting gets made into a film this unsatisfying. Firstly, you have to have a screenwriter who really wants to make a point about how he understands the original. But another trait he has to have is that he doesn't think many other people understand the original. Then, you have to have him working with a culture he doesn't understand. How Sharon Stone got a job in a Catholic boarding school is amazing! Let alone how Palmintieri could stand over his dying wife, or how a boy could break through into the headmaster's quarters, witness the entire scene, and not be sent away. I had nine years in boarding school, and not once, thankfully, did I get to see my headmaster bare-chested. I can understand the chap's fascination with his naked language teacher, and it's very plausible he might find his way to a window to watch from a distance, but he must be the most intuitive, caring boy in the world to have grasped that something was very wrong - and then, if he had done so, he would have gone straight for that adult that Palmintieri has to tell him to go and find. Perhaps he is desperately in love with Miss Adjani. Whatever. Then you have two other awful, awful pieces of writing/casting. (a) the video team - straight out of the 'Titanic' school of cheeky-chappy enthusiasts who say dude all the time and really don't give a fiddler's toss about anything other than the geeky enjoyment their jobs bring them. This kind of embarrasiing stereotyping wiped at least a star off my rating of 'Lock, Stock' (the scousers) and it's just insulting to camera technicians everywhere. Hollywood's presentation of enthusiasts has often been has often been unkind in a 'let's laugh at them' kind of way; here,it's unwatchable. And (b) the other members of staff. You kind of wish the two girls could have chosen their victims more wisely. That would have made the ending much more acceptable. While they were about it, they could also have knocked off that bug-eyed monster whom someone has come back later on in order to introduce a "mystery" element with the sunglasses. Then, you MUST have a director who wants to refer back to the original with as many 'atmosphere shots' as he can find. Probably in homage to it, but again, with no real point. In the original, the dripping tap serves a purpose of heightening the atmosphere of tension. In this film, there IS no tension until right near the end, when KB is wandering through the garage. But why is she wandering through the garage? So the director can 'explain' where Palmintieri has been hiding all this time. By trying to do the original film homage while making his own point about what a great scriptwriter he is (is he?) or what a great director he is (is he?), the person or persons most responsible for this film, clearly told to cut down on the length of the original, never pauses long enough to let anything sink in. Thus the rhythm of the piece goes sideways. And I found myself thinking there must have been a moment during production when some studio heads said, "But, you see, we MUST have some violence, and a chase, some nudity and a sex scene." What began life as a vicious rape of his wife in the 50s classic becomes a ludicrous idea in this, effortlessly summarised by another reviewer here (thank you sir) as words to the effect of, "He terrorises and humiliates her so much that she has to shag him." I must say, though, Stone and Bates give class performances where and when they can - it's just Stone belongs in another film entirely, and Bates is given some classic quips but becomes a pawn in the filmmakers' race for the perfect, satisfying ending. Indeed, as other commentators have noted, halfway through they decide she is Columbo. "Just one more thing," she says, and I kid you not. Anyway, dears, the perfect, satisfying ending would have been for Bates to have locked everyone else in the school, including the scriptwriter and the director, and set fire to it. This film does nothing that you can't find in the French and Saunders videos on Youtube (try the classic "House of Idiot" or "Whatever Happened to Baby Dawn". Except embarrass you, appal you, and make you sick. But you know, there is a plus-side. The film ended!

    Character uses another to kill third one. Then the used character (always the less vicious and the more emotional) discovered the ugly truth of being used to serve hidden purposes for the first character and its hidden associate. Sometimes that associate could be the murdered party, sometimes the deceived could be a man or a woman, and many times it's from that deceived one's point of view. Since (Double Indemnity - 1944) this very formula in the Noir or the crime movies is so popular. Although there are endless ways to recycle and create through this old story, but most of the products along the years aren't excellent or even unpredictable. Based on a French movie or not, (Diabolique) isn't original or that good. It's even not convincing at places and rather idiot at others ! Since the whole thing is about killing the sick kind wife then why not to use less complicated ways? And if the husband is that sadistic deceitful why not to divorce him easily? And how oh how this husband brooked this amount of water for all of this time ? He must be Aquaman for god's sake ! Just like the gratuitous nudity here, the need for a lesbian relationship between the 2 women seemed for pure commercial purposes more than a dramatic motive (as a sexual tension between the 2 leads to make the audience hungry for love scene !). Yet, it's more powerful to watch (Stone) rescues (Adjani) at the end because she lastly felt the bound between them as 2 aggrieved women, not a "loving couple" where in this case the rescue becomes ordinary deed ?! Some of the situations looked so forced; such as the compulsory bad launch. Some of characters' reactions were so horribly bad; (Adjani) outrageously smiling among the professors at the lunch's table while she's supposed to be so sad and confused because of her husband's disappearance ! The intentions of (Kathy Bates)'s character were vague. There was no need for the character of the boy who peeks at his teacher nude ! Plus I didn't hear about a commercial that took this long to be filmed (clearly the 2 camera guys were living in the school for more than a week !??). The performance was truly laughable from (Isabelle Adjani)'s side. Along with being strangely not pretty sight this time, she dumbly was astounded, absentminded, sad, or scared all by the same goggled eyes ! Though she gave me so-provocative-it's-attractive acting to an extent that made the movie worth watching for a second time just for that ! I can't blame (Palmentieri) since the script dealt with him as a prototype scumbag. (Sharon Stone) did some fair acting; I think she was the only winner here. With a sluggish pace, and a story got no depth (for instance why it's a school, not a hotel ? a hospital ? or a company ??) you've got to ask yourself eventually why they didn't call it (scare your wife to death)?!, but Ah.. that could've ruined it. However with that ending it deserves a title like (treat women well otherwise they'll kill you) although it fits this story right but that could've ruined it too ! In fact the movie's finale makes it an explicit manifesto about how women, all the different kinds of women, CAN unite to kill one vile man and get away with it. So be aware of their anger because It's Woman Power baby ! A very sly notice : this movie came out one year after TV shows like Xena Warrior Princess (1995), and one year before another one : Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997).. I'll leave it to your intelligence to figure out the connections and what it could say about America of the mid-90s. However, in its core, all what the movie wanted is being a thriller with a different frame this time, to end up as one which's between average and poor despite the glow of it, especially with grand music, well cinematography, and interesting direction. To sum it all up I must tell : while it's a thrilling mystery this movie made me fall asleep in front of it. Sorry not that diabolic !

    The original here is one of the best thrillers, energetic in a way that distracts us from the revelation of the con. This is a lesser movie, but adds at least three clever ideas. If you are interested in narrative structure, you'll be interested in remakes of films and how they change. (I think these are changes to the original.) First, in true folding style, they added a film within the film. The film within is a recruiting film, but that hardly matters. Second, they changed the dynamic of the detective by making him a her. This allows for the third change but along the way the possibilities exist for the three types of women: the virgin, the whore and the shrew. It isn't played up well enough to matter, but its clear that someone's intuition was tuned. Third, there is a final twist that I think is quite different than the original's. It bonds the three women, already hinted in a lesbian tendency between the first two. But amazingly, the film didn't work well for me, probably because of pacing problems at various levels. Not that any level was off by the interplay of levels wasn't syncopated according to what engages. Its an intuitive process, I think, but quite rigid in its rules. Isabelle Adjani was cast perfectly, and introduced very skillfully. Beginnings are hard. This in its original incarnation was the first double con movie, I think. Adding a third was inevitable, I suppose. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.

    "Diabolique", a remake of the 1955 French horror/thriller "Les Diaboliques", centers on Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), a devout Catholic woman who is married to an abusive headmaster, Guy (Chazz Palminteri), with whom she runs an all boy's school. She is fairly close to his mistress, Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone), who is a teacher at the school, and the two conspire a plot to murder him. After the deed is done, they dispose of his body in the school's filthy swimming pool... but when the pool is drained, his body is gone, and strange things begin to haunt them, while a nosy detective (Kathy Bates) begins to catch onto the elaborate plot. To start off with, I consider the original "Les Diaboliques" one of the best horror movies of all time - it's painfully suspenseful, genuinely creepy, and has one of the best twist-endings I've ever seen. So, I went into this remake with fairly low expectations, and that may have been why I didn't mind it so much. I knew there was no possible way this re-imagining could out- do the original. So, with that said, I found this film to be a fairly entertaining thriller, even though I knew all the twists and turns of the plot ahead of time. The film takes place in modern day, but maintains a very 1950s feel, with the wardrobe and the old-fashioned architecture of the school. It's surprisingly pretty faithful to the original movie, too, with a few changes scattered about, some for the better and some for the worst. I thought the update of the murder scene was well executed, as was the climax of the film (again, even though I was aware of what to expect). However, as expected, we do have a very "Hollywood" ending - the movie follows the original closely until the last ten minutes, where the conclusion becomes what most American movie-goers would expect. I can't say it's necessarily that awful, and I wasn't expecting the writers to follow the cold, ambiguous conclusion the original had. I suppose I was a tad bit disappointed they didn't stick with the original ending, but what they did do with the new ending was clever. I'd say my biggest complaint here was the absence of ambiguity and suspense the original film upheld. The suspense was fairly secondhand in comparison, and I'd like to have seen improvement there. Acting-wise, I have mixed feelings. Sharon Stone, I felt, was fairly poor at times in her delivery and overall performance, while at other times she did quite well. Her performance was a bit topsy-turvy, but she was good enough, and does have the right 'look' for the part. Isabelle Adjani was great, she made her character very lovable, and her melancholy facial expressions were priceless. Chazz Palminteri was also good in the abusive, jerk-of-a-husband role. I also enjoyed Kathy Bates in the role of the detective, which was played by a male in the original. She's a great actress and played her quirky, offbeat role excellently. Overall, "Diabolique" is a bit of a mixed bag. I enjoyed it mainly because I found the re- imagining of the story an interesting idea, and the re-construction of some of those classic scenes was neat to watch. The problem with this film is if you see it before you see the 1955 version, you probably will enjoy it because the story and plot twists are really clever. However, if you've already seen the original, the story is essentially spoiled. I personally enjoyed watching the re-construction of it though, even with it's faults. I'd say this 1996 version of the story is a decent companion piece to the original - it's fairly entertaining, but can't hold a candle to the film it was based upon. 6/10.

    Mia is being abused by her husband Guy. It's too bad because Mia has heart problems. So her and her friend Nicole decide that Guy should have a little "accident." So they work together but Mia is all nervous and tense but Nicole is cool. Then they drain the pond and Mia starts to freak out. I keep thinking, "what is going on?" I really don't know if he is dead or alive or if someone pulled him out. Then I got to the end and I wasn't surprised because I had that idea in my head too. I couldn't really figure out whose side was whose. Where Mia and Nicole still working together? Then there is that detective with one breast that I thought that was involved but forget that. Forget this whole movie because it's way too confusing.

    I heard some really bad things about this remake of the classic French film 'Les Diaboliques', and I would never have expected it to be a patch on the brilliant original anyway; the only reason I even bothered to watch it is because it happened to be on TV, and there happened to be nothing else on. However, after the first half hour or so; while the film indeed is nothing on the original, it seemed like it was going to end up being a decent thriller. But then the problems start; the parts where the original's character reflected on what they'd done were the best parts of the film; here they're extremely boring, and that's where the film falls down. The plot is basically the same as the original and focuses on a school which is ran by a man with a wife and a mistress; neither of which like him. They decide that killing him would be a great idea, and promptly do it. However, after disposing of the body in the school swimming pool and later having it emptied; the body isn't there! And what's worse is that the women start to find clues that he may still be alive... It's a real shame that this film wasn't better as the two female leads are excellent. I'm not sure that I would have made it all the way to the end if it wasn't for the fact that I had the beautiful Isabelle Adjani to admire. It's not her greatest performance and she seems to be on autopilot, but she fits into the scared mousy role well. She is joined by Sharon Stone, who is brilliantly cast as Adjani's colder and more collected opposite number. Stone also looks good, which is certainly a bonus considering the shortcomings of the rest of the film. The problem with the second half of the film is really that it's not interesting, and there aren't enough other things going on to make up for it. There's a hint of a lesbian relationship between the two leads, though nothing really comes of it; definitely a big mistake considering how great they both look! Having already seen the original, the ending came as no surprise; but I'm certain that I could have guessed anyway as there soon becomes only one way that it can go. Overall, I could probably watch Isabelle Adjani all day long; but not when the film in question is this one. There's not much point bothering with this...see the original instead.

    Diabolique is set in Pennsylvania at the St. Anselm's boarding school for boys which is owned by Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), however her husband Guy (Chazz Palminteri) who runs the school treats her like dirt & cheats on her. Mia & a teacher named Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone) whom is one of Guy's many lovers devise a plan to kill him & make it look like an accident, the plan is to drown him & then throw him in the school pool where he will be found & to the police his death will seem like a simple drowning. However after a few days the body isn't found so Mia orders the dirty pool drained when Nicole 'accidently' drops her keys into it, once drained Guy's body is not there. Was Guy dead? Did someone find out there plan? Who knows... Directed by Jeremiah Chechik this is a remake of the black and white French film Les Diaboliques (1955) which itself was based on the novel 'Celle Qui N'Etait Plus' by Pierre Boileau & Thomas Narcejac & I thought was a fairly lazy & plodding mystery thriller with truly one of the worst twist endings ever. The humourless & slow moving script by Don Ross takes ages to do what the average episode of Columbo took about 10 minutes to, to show someone committing the so-called perfect murder. Then it switches to creepy thriller mode as the body vanishes from where the murderers left it & seemingly has come back to life before it all falls apart with one of the worst, most predictable & frankly unlikable twist endings ever. I can't continue my review any further without massive spoilers which will give away the ending so beware, anyway I hate the fact that Mia & Nicole suddenly turn into the heroes of the piece when they were just as bad as Guy since in the case of Mia she planned to kill him in cold blood & Nicole was prepared to trick Mia & ultimately kill her if the plan had succeeded. They were really unlikable character's to begin with so this horrible ending where they become the heroes by killing Guy which is basically exactly the same thing which they set out to do in the first place just grated my nerves. Also, if Mia was feeling so guilty why did she seem almost redeemed at the end? She still ended up killing Guy anyway so why the miraculous change of heart? Also, what about Nicole? She still was part of some scheme where someone was always going to die, be it either Mia or Guy. The ending is just so misjudged, it makes no sense with the rest of the context of the film, it's horribly acted & it's utterly predictable. In fact I guessed how this would end within 30 minutes & I was absolutely right in just about every detail. A really horrible film with an even worse ending, one to avoid. Director Chechik has made some really, really awful films & after this mess & his subsequent big screen adaptation of The Avengers (1998) which is considered one of the worst films ever made Hollywood thankfully hasn't let him anywhere near a film camera since. This guy should be directing traffic rather than films. This is blandly shot in dull autumnal colours which give it forgettable look. I also have to mention the acting, especially by the two female leads Stone & Adjani who are simply terrible. I hated their character's, I hated their acting & thought they were two of the worst performances by leading actors in a Hollywood flick I've ever seen. In the UK this is rated '18' meaning no-one under that age can watch it, I have no idea why as there's no violence worth mentioning, no nudity or sex & it's devoid of any action or excitement. Technically the film is alright but it's flat, dull & blandly filmed. There's no real style here & it's not a film I will remember in any way apart from that terrible ending. As I've said I think the acting by the two leads is simply awful. Diaboliques is a slow moving, utterly predictable thriller with a horrible ending that didn't do anything for me. One to avoid. This probably would have worked better as a 30 minute Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode or maybe even as an obscure black and white French film from the 50's...

    The classic French thriller Diabolique has a sturdy story, which is one reason why it is a target for remakes. The film was remade for American television twice - first as Reflections of Murder (featuring Tuesday Weld, Joan Hackett and Sam Waterston) and later as House of Secrets (with Melissa Gilbert and Bruce Boxleitner). To be honest, both of those remakes are certainly interesting to watch, if lacking in the suspense and novelty of the original. Reflections is fairly faithful to its parent, while House of Secrets maintains the bare bones of the storyline and throws in a different setting and some elements of voodoo. If you have not seen the original, the enjoyment level of both those films will be elevated. The same cannot be said for the first dunderheaded attempt to cinematically remake the French classic for American audiences. Keeping the original name, story and setting would seem a step in the right direction, but the film fails due to some incredibly foolish choices. The action takes place at a private boys prep school overseen by the hateful Chazz Palminteri. In between stealing funds from the school, Palminteri enjoys subjecting wife Isabelle Adjani - who suffers from a weak heart - to assorted cruelties. In his spare time, he engages in S&M with ice queen blond teacher Sharon Stone. The two women - tired of his abuse - decide to murder him, drop his body in the disgustingly filthy school pool and make it appear that he drowned in a drunken accident. Naturally, nothing goes according to plan. The best thing about this film is probably the casting of Sharon Stone in the role made famous by French actress Simone Signoret. If anyone embodies some of the same cunning and sensuality of Signoret from the original in a modern actress, it would be Stone. Unfortunately, the screenplay and everything around her fails to support her in any way. The changes made to the screenplay are not improvements. While a remake need not be slavishly faithful to the original, it should not completely go off the beaten path the way that this film does, particularly in its finale. The shock twist ending of the original may no longer be fresh, but the shaggy dog pseudo-feminist tilt tacked on to this latest effort seems to come completely from left field and is a blatant misfire. If Stone was an inspired choice, the remainder of the cast is less so. Isabelle Adjani, looking puffy and listless, is completely underwhelming as the abused wife. At no point does she engage our sympathy and she often seems entirely too lacking in energy to be remotely terrified. This may well be the most laid-back "frightened" performance one has ever seen on celluloid. Kathy Bates shows up as a detective investigating Palmineri's disappearance and driving the women to distraction. Her performance is immensely enjoyable and she seems to be having a good time. As a cancer survivor, she gets to crack completely inappropriate jokes and attempts to lay the groundwork for the "we're all sisters under the skin" meme that creeps into the film's finale. Unfortunately, her character and performance belongs in a completely different (and one would argue better) film. And the casting of Chazz Palminteri as the abusive schoolmaster is a disaster. Palminteri, providing the same performance here as he does in his guise of the reliable Mafia hit man roles in which he specializes, is laughably miscast. As tough as he comes off, Adjani could arguably physically match him and Stone could step on him without blinking twice. Not only that, but we have to believe that there was something that attracted these two attractive women to him and kept them in his orbit when they could easily have moved on. Palminteri, resembling a large trout, and playing a man with the charisma of a barracuda, seems an impossible prospect for these women. We have to believe that one lovely woman would fall for him (much less two) and no gigantic leap of faith can make this happen. Director Jeremiah Chechik has absolutely no idea how to maintain suspense or an atmosphere of foreboding. The scene shifts are klutzy and obvious. The pacing is often laborious, which allows the viewer time to mull over the complexities of the plots and double-crosses played out before us and realize how absurd the entire scenario truly is - something that the original (as well as its TV remakes) never allowed the viewer time to contemplate. This material needs a skilled hand, but what is provided is a clumsy sledgehammer. The original is noted especially for its shock ending. This remake seems initially to be going for the same thing and then suddenly backtracks - with remorseless characters suddenly developing consciences and people conducting themselves in ways not previously indicated in their respective behavior. By the time all of the leads end up in a watery fight, one realizes what a foolish level to which the film has sunk. One is sternly advised to locate either the original French classic or one of its TV counterparts before descending to this entry.

    Someone recently said "Hollywood hates originality". This is the unfortunate evidence. I can only guess that the few favorable reviews came from people who never experienced the original film or were just too lazy to watch a film in a foreign language. Clouzot's effort was magnificent way back in the '50's. This was just a sad attempt at some fast bucks with no talent in front of or behind the camera. In the original film, the background of the school was seedy and cheap, the characters were unattractive in general and the surroundings were oppressive. This "sanitized" version misses the original point entirely. There was little or no suspense and no "atmosphere" at all. What a stupid waste. Ditto the remake of "Rear Window" but that's another review again... Curtis Stotlar

    **SPOILERS** Decent remake of the French 1955 film noir classic of the same title about two women, wife and mistress, planning the murder of their both sleazy and ape-like husband and lover that ends up boomeranging on both of them. In this modernized version of "Diabolique" the story takes place in Pennsylvania not France with headmistress and owner of an all boys private school Mia Baran, Isabelle Adjani, having her fill of taking all the abuse she can from her caveman like husband Guy, Chezz Palminteri. Mia gets together with Guy's also abused mistress, who got her left eye blackened by him, Nicole Horner played by an ultra sexy looking Sharon Stone who's also a teacher at the boys school. The two abused women plan to finally do away with the creep and make his death look like a drowning accident. It takes a while for the very Catholic observing Mia to agree to Nicole's plan to murder Guy but the way he treats her,like dirt, pushes her over the edge in willing to do him in. Luring Guy away from the boys school where he resides both Nicoel and Mia have him secretly travel to a friends home, the Danzingers, in Pittsburgh where they plan to murder him. It's there that Mia got the brutish Guy drunk, which wasn't that hard top do, on booze that was spiked with a number of strong sleeping pills. With Guy out cold the two dumped him into the bathtub and with the help of what looked like a ten gallon bottle filled with water,to keep him from floating to the surface, ended up drowning him. It's when back at the boys school when Nicole & Mia dumped the boozed and drugged up as well as dead Guy into the school swimming pool that strange things started to happen! Guy not only didn't go to the bottom he didn't even go to the top of the pool? In fact he just plumb disappeared from sight over or under the water line! The rest of the movie has Mia, the weaker of the two murderesses, slowly going to pieces in not only what she did in murdering her husband but far worse in not knowing where his body is in order to give it a decent Catholic burial! Going to the local police to have them track down her missing husband Mia is spotted by retired lady detective Shirley Vogel, Kathy Bates, who smells a big story and takes over the investigation in the missing Guy Barnan. ***SPOILERS*** It doesn't take long for Vogel to realized that something isn't exactly kosher in Guy's mysterious disappearance. Checking out all the facts Vogel finds out that Guy was embezzling the funds for the boys school and planning to bankrupt it in order to throw off suspicion on himself by the local police. What's even more interesting is that Guy's partner in crime was non other then Nicoe Horner! His mistress whom, as Vogel soon suspects, was very possibly his murderer as well! The unexpected and shocking final in the film in fact outdoes the original, the 1955 French version, with the truth coming to the surface in what was the real reason in murdering Guy and who were the one's who cooked it up in the first place! This was enough to give you, like one of the principle characters in the movie, an almost fatal heart attack! The fact that the intended victim of this elaborately planned scheme didn't end up dropping dead from fright turned out to be disastrous for those who planned it!

    I've read through many perspectives on this film, and one that seems to crop up time and again is the word 'camp.' Unfortunately, the film never establishes itself as camp, or indeed anything. It's pointless. There being little to add to the dissection of this film's problems, let's concentrate for a second on how a script this revolting gets made into a film this unsatisfying. Firstly, you have to have a screenwriter who really wants to make a point about how he understands the original. But another trait he has to have is that he doesn't think many other people understand the original. Then, you have to have him working with a culture he doesn't understand. How Sharon Stone got a job in a Catholic boarding school is amazing! Let alone how Palmintieri could stand over his dying wife, or how a boy could break through into the headmaster's quarters, witness the entire scene, and not be sent away. I had nine years in boarding school, and not once, thankfully, did I get to see my headmaster bare-chested. I can understand the chap's fascination with his naked language teacher, and it's very plausible he might find his way to a window to watch from a distance, but he must be the most intuitive, caring boy in the world to have grasped that something was very wrong - and then, if he had done so, he would have gone straight for that adult that Palmintieri has to tell him to go and find. Perhaps he is desperately in love with Miss Adjani. Whatever. Then you have two other awful, awful pieces of writing/casting. (a) the video team - straight out of the 'Titanic' school of cheeky-chappy enthusiasts who say dude all the time and really don't give a fiddler's toss about anything other than the geeky enjoyment their jobs bring them. This kind of embarrasiing stereotyping wiped at least a star off my rating of 'Lock, Stock' (the scousers) and it's just insulting to camera technicians everywhere. Hollywood's presentation of enthusiasts has often been has often been unkind in a 'let's laugh at them' kind of way; here,it's unwatchable. And (b) the other members of staff. You kind of wish the two girls could have chosen their victims more wisely. That would have made the ending much more acceptable. While they were about it, they could also have knocked off that bug-eyed monster whom someone has come back later on in order to introduce a "mystery" element with the sunglasses. Then, you MUST have a director who wants to refer back to the original with as many 'atmosphere shots' as he can find. Probably in homage to it, but again, with no real point. In the original, the dripping tap serves a purpose of heightening the atmosphere of tension. In this film, there IS no tension until right near the end, when KB is wandering through the garage. But why is she wandering through the garage? So the director can 'explain' where Palmintieri has been hiding all this time. By trying to do the original film homage while making his own point about what a great scriptwriter he is (is he?) or what a great director he is (is he?), the person or persons most responsible for this film, clearly told to cut down on the length of the original, never pauses long enough to let anything sink in. Thus the rhythm of the piece goes sideways. And I found myself thinking there must have been a moment during production when some studio heads said, "But, you see, we MUST have some violence, and a chase, some nudity and a sex scene." What began life as a vicious rape of his wife in the 50s classic becomes a ludicrous idea in this, effortlessly summarised by another reviewer here (thank you sir) as words to the effect of, "He terrorises and humiliates her so much that she has to shag him." I must say, though, Stone and Bates give class performances where and when they can - it's just Stone belongs in another film entirely, and Bates is given some classic quips but becomes a pawn in the filmmakers' race for the perfect, satisfying ending. Indeed, as other commentators have noted, halfway through they decide she is Columbo. "Just one more thing," she says, and I kid you not. Anyway, dears, the perfect, satisfying ending would have been for Bates to have locked everyone else in the school, including the scriptwriter and the director, and set fire to it. This film does nothing that you can't find in the French and Saunders videos on Youtube (try the classic "House of Idiot" or "Whatever Happened to Baby Dawn". Except embarrass you, appal you, and make you sick. But you know, there is a plus-side. The film ended!

    Character uses another to kill third one. Then the used character (always the less vicious and the more emotional) discovered the ugly truth of being used to serve hidden purposes for the first character and its hidden associate. Sometimes that associate could be the murdered party, sometimes the deceived could be a man or a woman, and many times it's from that deceived one's point of view. Since (Double Indemnity - 1944) this very formula in the Noir or the crime movies is so popular. Although there are endless ways to recycle and create through this old story, but most of the products along the years aren't excellent or even unpredictable. Based on a French movie or not, (Diabolique) isn't original or that good. It's even not convincing at places and rather idiot at others ! Since the whole thing is about killing the sick kind wife then why not to use less complicated ways? And if the husband is that sadistic deceitful why not to divorce him easily? And how oh how this husband brooked this amount of water for all of this time ? He must be Aquaman for god's sake ! Just like the gratuitous nudity here, the need for a lesbian relationship between the 2 women seemed for pure commercial purposes more than a dramatic motive (as a sexual tension between the 2 leads to make the audience hungry for love scene !). Yet, it's more powerful to watch (Stone) rescues (Adjani) at the end because she lastly felt the bound between them as 2 aggrieved women, not a "loving couple" where in this case the rescue becomes ordinary deed ?! Some of the situations looked so forced; such as the compulsory bad launch. Some of characters' reactions were so horribly bad; (Adjani) outrageously smiling among the professors at the lunch's table while she's supposed to be so sad and confused because of her husband's disappearance ! The intentions of (Kathy Bates)'s character were vague. There was no need for the character of the boy who peeks at his teacher nude ! Plus I didn't hear about a commercial that took this long to be filmed (clearly the 2 camera guys were living in the school for more than a week !??). The performance was truly laughable from (Isabelle Adjani)'s side. Along with being strangely not pretty sight this time, she dumbly was astounded, absentminded, sad, or scared all by the same goggled eyes ! Though she gave me so-provocative-it's-attractive acting to an extent that made the movie worth watching for a second time just for that ! I can't blame (Palmentieri) since the script dealt with him as a prototype scumbag. (Sharon Stone) did some fair acting; I think she was the only winner here. With a sluggish pace, and a story got no depth (for instance why it's a school, not a hotel ? a hospital ? or a company ??) you've got to ask yourself eventually why they didn't call it (scare your wife to death)?!, but Ah.. that could've ruined it. However with that ending it deserves a title like (treat women well otherwise they'll kill you) although it fits this story right but that could've ruined it too ! In fact the movie's finale makes it an explicit manifesto about how women, all the different kinds of women, CAN unite to kill one vile man and get away with it. So be aware of their anger because It's Woman Power baby ! A very sly notice : this movie came out one year after TV shows like Xena Warrior Princess (1995), and one year before another one : Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997).. I'll leave it to your intelligence to figure out the connections and what it could say about America of the mid-90s. However, in its core, all what the movie wanted is being a thriller with a different frame this time, to end up as one which's between average and poor despite the glow of it, especially with grand music, well cinematography, and interesting direction. To sum it all up I must tell : while it's a thrilling mystery this movie made me fall asleep in front of it. Sorry not that diabolic !

    The original here is one of the best thrillers, energetic in a way that distracts us from the revelation of the con. This is a lesser movie, but adds at least three clever ideas. If you are interested in narrative structure, you'll be interested in remakes of films and how they change. (I think these are changes to the original.) First, in true folding style, they added a film within the film. The film within is a recruiting film, but that hardly matters. Second, they changed the dynamic of the detective by making him a her. This allows for the third change but along the way the possibilities exist for the three types of women: the virgin, the whore and the shrew. It isn't played up well enough to matter, but its clear that someone's intuition was tuned. Third, there is a final twist that I think is quite different than the original's. It bonds the three women, already hinted in a lesbian tendency between the first two. But amazingly, the film didn't work well for me, probably because of pacing problems at various levels. Not that any level was off by the interplay of levels wasn't syncopated according to what engages. Its an intuitive process, I think, but quite rigid in its rules. Isabelle Adjani was cast perfectly, and introduced very skillfully. Beginnings are hard. This in its original incarnation was the first double con movie, I think. Adding a third was inevitable, I suppose. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.

    "Diabolique", a remake of the 1955 French horror/thriller "Les Diaboliques", centers on Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), a devout Catholic woman who is married to an abusive headmaster, Guy (Chazz Palminteri), with whom she runs an all boy's school. She is fairly close to his mistress, Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone), who is a teacher at the school, and the two conspire a plot to murder him. After the deed is done, they dispose of his body in the school's filthy swimming pool... but when the pool is drained, his body is gone, and strange things begin to haunt them, while a nosy detective (Kathy Bates) begins to catch onto the elaborate plot. To start off with, I consider the original "Les Diaboliques" one of the best horror movies of all time - it's painfully suspenseful, genuinely creepy, and has one of the best twist-endings I've ever seen. So, I went into this remake with fairly low expectations, and that may have been why I didn't mind it so much. I knew there was no possible way this re-imagining could out- do the original. So, with that said, I found this film to be a fairly entertaining thriller, even though I knew all the twists and turns of the plot ahead of time. The film takes place in modern day, but maintains a very 1950s feel, with the wardrobe and the old-fashioned architecture of the school. It's surprisingly pretty faithful to the original movie, too, with a few changes scattered about, some for the better and some for the worst. I thought the update of the murder scene was well executed, as was the climax of the film (again, even though I was aware of what to expect). However, as expected, we do have a very "Hollywood" ending - the movie follows the original closely until the last ten minutes, where the conclusion becomes what most American movie-goers would expect. I can't say it's necessarily that awful, and I wasn't expecting the writers to follow the cold, ambiguous conclusion the original had. I suppose I was a tad bit disappointed they didn't stick with the original ending, but what they did do with the new ending was clever. I'd say my biggest complaint here was the absence of ambiguity and suspense the original film upheld. The suspense was fairly secondhand in comparison, and I'd like to have seen improvement there. Acting-wise, I have mixed feelings. Sharon Stone, I felt, was fairly poor at times in her delivery and overall performance, while at other times she did quite well. Her performance was a bit topsy-turvy, but she was good enough, and does have the right 'look' for the part. Isabelle Adjani was great, she made her character very lovable, and her melancholy facial expressions were priceless. Chazz Palminteri was also good in the abusive, jerk-of-a-husband role. I also enjoyed Kathy Bates in the role of the detective, which was played by a male in the original. She's a great actress and played her quirky, offbeat role excellently. Overall, "Diabolique" is a bit of a mixed bag. I enjoyed it mainly because I found the re- imagining of the story an interesting idea, and the re-construction of some of those classic scenes was neat to watch. The problem with this film is if you see it before you see the 1955 version, you probably will enjoy it because the story and plot twists are really clever. However, if you've already seen the original, the story is essentially spoiled. I personally enjoyed watching the re-construction of it though, even with it's faults. I'd say this 1996 version of the story is a decent companion piece to the original - it's fairly entertaining, but can't hold a candle to the film it was based upon. 6/10.

    Mia is being abused by her husband Guy. It's too bad because Mia has heart problems. So her and her friend Nicole decide that Guy should have a little "accident." So they work together but Mia is all nervous and tense but Nicole is cool. Then they drain the pond and Mia starts to freak out. I keep thinking, "what is going on?" I really don't know if he is dead or alive or if someone pulled him out. Then I got to the end and I wasn't surprised because I had that idea in my head too. I couldn't really figure out whose side was whose. Where Mia and Nicole still working together? Then there is that detective with one breast that I thought that was involved but forget that. Forget this whole movie because it's way too confusing.

    I heard some really bad things about this remake of the classic French film 'Les Diaboliques', and I would never have expected it to be a patch on the brilliant original anyway; the only reason I even bothered to watch it is because it happened to be on TV, and there happened to be nothing else on. However, after the first half hour or so; while the film indeed is nothing on the original, it seemed like it was going to end up being a decent thriller. But then the problems start; the parts where the original's character reflected on what they'd done were the best parts of the film; here they're extremely boring, and that's where the film falls down. The plot is basically the same as the original and focuses on a school which is ran by a man with a wife and a mistress; neither of which like him. They decide that killing him would be a great idea, and promptly do it. However, after disposing of the body in the school swimming pool and later having it emptied; the body isn't there! And what's worse is that the women start to find clues that he may still be alive... It's a real shame that this film wasn't better as the two female leads are excellent. I'm not sure that I would have made it all the way to the end if it wasn't for the fact that I had the beautiful Isabelle Adjani to admire. It's not her greatest performance and she seems to be on autopilot, but she fits into the scared mousy role well. She is joined by Sharon Stone, who is brilliantly cast as Adjani's colder and more collected opposite number. Stone also looks good, which is certainly a bonus considering the shortcomings of the rest of the film. The problem with the second half of the film is really that it's not interesting, and there aren't enough other things going on to make up for it. There's a hint of a lesbian relationship between the two leads, though nothing really comes of it; definitely a big mistake considering how great they both look! Having already seen the original, the ending came as no surprise; but I'm certain that I could have guessed anyway as there soon becomes only one way that it can go. Overall, I could probably watch Isabelle Adjani all day long; but not when the film in question is this one. There's not much point bothering with this...see the original instead.

    Diabolique is set in Pennsylvania at the St. Anselm's boarding school for boys which is owned by Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), however her husband Guy (Chazz Palminteri) who runs the school treats her like dirt & cheats on her. Mia & a teacher named Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone) whom is one of Guy's many lovers devise a plan to kill him & make it look like an accident, the plan is to drown him & then throw him in the school pool where he will be found & to the police his death will seem like a simple drowning. However after a few days the body isn't found so Mia orders the dirty pool drained when Nicole 'accidently' drops her keys into it, once drained Guy's body is not there. Was Guy dead? Did someone find out there plan? Who knows... Directed by Jeremiah Chechik this is a remake of the black and white French film Les Diaboliques (1955) which itself was based on the novel 'Celle Qui N'Etait Plus' by Pierre Boileau & Thomas Narcejac & I thought was a fairly lazy & plodding mystery thriller with truly one of the worst twist endings ever. The humourless & slow moving script by Don Ross takes ages to do what the average episode of Columbo took about 10 minutes to, to show someone committing the so-called perfect murder. Then it switches to creepy thriller mode as the body vanishes from where the murderers left it & seemingly has come back to life before it all falls apart with one of the worst, most predictable & frankly unlikable twist endings ever. I can't continue my review any further without massive spoilers which will give away the ending so beware, anyway I hate the fact that Mia & Nicole suddenly turn into the heroes of the piece when they were just as bad as Guy since in the case of Mia she planned to kill him in cold blood & Nicole was prepared to trick Mia & ultimately kill her if the plan had succeeded. They were really unlikable character's to begin with so this horrible ending where they become the heroes by killing Guy which is basically exactly the same thing which they set out to do in the first place just grated my nerves. Also, if Mia was feeling so guilty why did she seem almost redeemed at the end? She still ended up killing Guy anyway so why the miraculous change of heart? Also, what about Nicole? She still was part of some scheme where someone was always going to die, be it either Mia or Guy. The ending is just so misjudged, it makes no sense with the rest of the context of the film, it's horribly acted & it's utterly predictable. In fact I guessed how this would end within 30 minutes & I was absolutely right in just about every detail. A really horrible film with an even worse ending, one to avoid. Director Chechik has made some really, really awful films & after this mess & his subsequent big screen adaptation of The Avengers (1998) which is considered one of the worst films ever made Hollywood thankfully hasn't let him anywhere near a film camera since. This guy should be directing traffic rather than films. This is blandly shot in dull autumnal colours which give it forgettable look. I also have to mention the acting, especially by the two female leads Stone & Adjani who are simply terrible. I hated their character's, I hated their acting & thought they were two of the worst performances by leading actors in a Hollywood flick I've ever seen. In the UK this is rated '18' meaning no-one under that age can watch it, I have no idea why as there's no violence worth mentioning, no nudity or sex & it's devoid of any action or excitement. Technically the film is alright but it's flat, dull & blandly filmed. There's no real style here & it's not a film I will remember in any way apart from that terrible ending. As I've said I think the acting by the two leads is simply awful. Diaboliques is a slow moving, utterly predictable thriller with a horrible ending that didn't do anything for me. One to avoid. This probably would have worked better as a 30 minute Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode or maybe even as an obscure black and white French film from the 50's...

    The classic French thriller Diabolique has a sturdy story, which is one reason why it is a target for remakes. The film was remade for American television twice - first as Reflections of Murder (featuring Tuesday Weld, Joan Hackett and Sam Waterston) and later as House of Secrets (with Melissa Gilbert and Bruce Boxleitner). To be honest, both of those remakes are certainly interesting to watch, if lacking in the suspense and novelty of the original. Reflections is fairly faithful to its parent, while House of Secrets maintains the bare bones of the storyline and throws in a different setting and some elements of voodoo. If you have not seen the original, the enjoyment level of both those films will be elevated. The same cannot be said for the first dunderheaded attempt to cinematically remake the French classic for American audiences. Keeping the original name, story and setting would seem a step in the right direction, but the film fails due to some incredibly foolish choices. The action takes place at a private boys prep school overseen by the hateful Chazz Palminteri. In between stealing funds from the school, Palminteri enjoys subjecting wife Isabelle Adjani - who suffers from a weak heart - to assorted cruelties. In his spare time, he engages in S&M with ice queen blond teacher Sharon Stone. The two women - tired of his abuse - decide to murder him, drop his body in the disgustingly filthy school pool and make it appear that he drowned in a drunken accident. Naturally, nothing goes according to plan. The best thing about this film is probably the casting of Sharon Stone in the role made famous by French actress Simone Signoret. If anyone embodies some of the same cunning and sensuality of Signoret from the original in a modern actress, it would be Stone. Unfortunately, the screenplay and everything around her fails to support her in any way. The changes made to the screenplay are not improvements. While a remake need not be slavishly faithful to the original, it should not completely go off the beaten path the way that this film does, particularly in its finale. The shock twist ending of the original may no longer be fresh, but the shaggy dog pseudo-feminist tilt tacked on to this latest effort seems to come completely from left field and is a blatant misfire. If Stone was an inspired choice, the remainder of the cast is less so. Isabelle Adjani, looking puffy and listless, is completely underwhelming as the abused wife. At no point does she engage our sympathy and she often seems entirely too lacking in energy to be remotely terrified. This may well be the most laid-back "frightened" performance one has ever seen on celluloid. Kathy Bates shows up as a detective investigating Palmineri's disappearance and driving the women to distraction. Her performance is immensely enjoyable and she seems to be having a good time. As a cancer survivor, she gets to crack completely inappropriate jokes and attempts to lay the groundwork for the "we're all sisters under the skin" meme that creeps into the film's finale. Unfortunately, her character and performance belongs in a completely different (and one would argue better) film. And the casting of Chazz Palminteri as the abusive schoolmaster is a disaster. Palminteri, providing the same performance here as he does in his guise of the reliable Mafia hit man roles in which he specializes, is laughably miscast. As tough as he comes off, Adjani could arguably physically match him and Stone could step on him without blinking twice. Not only that, but we have to believe that there was something that attracted these two attractive women to him and kept them in his orbit when they could easily have moved on. Palminteri, resembling a large trout, and playing a man with the charisma of a barracuda, seems an impossible prospect for these women. We have to believe that one lovely woman would fall for him (much less two) and no gigantic leap of faith can make this happen. Director Jeremiah Chechik has absolutely no idea how to maintain suspense or an atmosphere of foreboding. The scene shifts are klutzy and obvious. The pacing is often laborious, which allows the viewer time to mull over the complexities of the plots and double-crosses played out before us and realize how absurd the entire scenario truly is - something that the original (as well as its TV remakes) never allowed the viewer time to contemplate. This material needs a skilled hand, but what is provided is a clumsy sledgehammer. The original is noted especially for its shock ending. This remake seems initially to be going for the same thing and then suddenly backtracks - with remorseless characters suddenly developing consciences and people conducting themselves in ways not previously indicated in their respective behavior. By the time all of the leads end up in a watery fight, one realizes what a foolish level to which the film has sunk. One is sternly advised to locate either the original French classic or one of its TV counterparts before descending to this entry.

    Someone recently said "Hollywood hates originality". This is the unfortunate evidence. I can only guess that the few favorable reviews came from people who never experienced the original film or were just too lazy to watch a film in a foreign language. Clouzot's effort was magnificent way back in the '50's. This was just a sad attempt at some fast bucks with no talent in front of or behind the camera. In the original film, the background of the school was seedy and cheap, the characters were unattractive in general and the surroundings were oppressive. This "sanitized" version misses the original point entirely. There was little or no suspense and no "atmosphere" at all. What a stupid waste. Ditto the remake of "Rear Window" but that's another review again... Curtis Stotlar

    **SPOILERS** Decent remake of the French 1955 film noir classic of the same title about two women, wife and mistress, planning the murder of their both sleazy and ape-like husband and lover that ends up boomeranging on both of them. In this modernized version of "Diabolique" the story takes place in Pennsylvania not France with headmistress and owner of an all boys private school Mia Baran, Isabelle Adjani, having her fill of taking all the abuse she can from her caveman like husband Guy, Chezz Palminteri. Mia gets together with Guy's also abused mistress, who got her left eye blackened by him, Nicole Horner played by an ultra sexy looking Sharon Stone who's also a teacher at the boys school. The two abused women plan to finally do away with the creep and make his death look like a drowning accident. It takes a while for the very Catholic observing Mia to agree to Nicole's plan to murder Guy but the way he treats her,like dirt, pushes her over the edge in willing to do him in. Luring Guy away from the boys school where he resides both Nicoel and Mia have him secretly travel to a friends home, the Danzingers, in Pittsburgh where they plan to murder him. It's there that Mia got the brutish Guy drunk, which wasn't that hard top do, on booze that was spiked with a number of strong sleeping pills. With Guy out cold the two dumped him into the bathtub and with the help of what looked like a ten gallon bottle filled with water,to keep him from floating to the surface, ended up drowning him. It's when back at the boys school when Nicole & Mia dumped the boozed and drugged up as well as dead Guy into the school swimming pool that strange things started to happen! Guy not only didn't go to the bottom he didn't even go to the top of the pool? In fact he just plumb disappeared from sight over or under the water line! The rest of the movie has Mia, the weaker of the two murderesses, slowly going to pieces in not only what she did in murdering her husband but far worse in not knowing where his body is in order to give it a decent Catholic burial! Going to the local police to have them track down her missing husband Mia is spotted by retired lady detective Shirley Vogel, Kathy Bates, who smells a big story and takes over the investigation in the missing Guy Barnan. ***SPOILERS*** It doesn't take long for Vogel to realized that something isn't exactly kosher in Guy's mysterious disappearance. Checking out all the facts Vogel finds out that Guy was embezzling the funds for the boys school and planning to bankrupt it in order to throw off suspicion on himself by the local police. What's even more interesting is that Guy's partner in crime was non other then Nicoe Horner! His mistress whom, as Vogel soon suspects, was very possibly his murderer as well! The unexpected and shocking final in the film in fact outdoes the original, the 1955 French version, with the truth coming to the surface in what was the real reason in murdering Guy and who were the one's who cooked it up in the first place! This was enough to give you, like one of the principle characters in the movie, an almost fatal heart attack! The fact that the intended victim of this elaborately planned scheme didn't end up dropping dead from fright turned out to be disastrous for those who planned it!

    I've read through many perspectives on this film, and one that seems to crop up time and again is the word 'camp.' Unfortunately, the film never establishes itself as camp, or indeed anything. It's pointless. There being little to add to the dissection of this film's problems, let's concentrate for a second on how a script this revolting gets made into a film this unsatisfying. Firstly, you have to have a screenwriter who really wants to make a point about how he understands the original. But another trait he has to have is that he doesn't think many other people understand the original. Then, you have to have him working with a culture he doesn't understand. How Sharon Stone got a job in a Catholic boarding school is amazing! Let alone how Palmintieri could stand over his dying wife, or how a boy could break through into the headmaster's quarters, witness the entire scene, and not be sent away. I had nine years in boarding school, and not once, thankfully, did I get to see my headmaster bare-chested. I can understand the chap's fascination with his naked language teacher, and it's very plausible he might find his way to a window to watch from a distance, but he must be the most intuitive, caring boy in the world to have grasped that something was very wrong - and then, if he had done so, he would have gone straight for that adult that Palmintieri has to tell him to go and find. Perhaps he is desperately in love with Miss Adjani. Whatever. Then you have two other awful, awful pieces of writing/casting. (a) the video team - straight out of the 'Titanic' school of cheeky-chappy enthusiasts who say dude all the time and really don't give a fiddler's toss about anything other than the geeky enjoyment their jobs bring them. This kind of embarrasiing stereotyping wiped at least a star off my rating of 'Lock, Stock' (the scousers) and it's just insulting to camera technicians everywhere. Hollywood's presentation of enthusiasts has often been has often been unkind in a 'let's laugh at them' kind of way; here,it's unwatchable. And (b) the other members of staff. You kind of wish the two girls could have chosen their victims more wisely. That would have made the ending much more acceptable. While they were about it, they could also have knocked off that bug-eyed monster whom someone has come back later on in order to introduce a "mystery" element with the sunglasses. Then, you MUST have a director who wants to refer back to the original with as many 'atmosphere shots' as he can find. Probably in homage to it, but again, with no real point. In the original, the dripping tap serves a purpose of heightening the atmosphere of tension. In this film, there IS no tension until right near the end, when KB is wandering through the garage. But why is she wandering through the garage? So the director can 'explain' where Palmintieri has been hiding all this time. By trying to do the original film homage while making his own point about what a great scriptwriter he is (is he?) or what a great director he is (is he?), the person or persons most responsible for this film, clearly told to cut down on the length of the original, never pauses long enough to let anything sink in. Thus the rhythm of the piece goes sideways. And I found myself thinking there must have been a moment during production when some studio heads said, "But, you see, we MUST have some violence, and a chase, some nudity and a sex scene." What began life as a vicious rape of his wife in the 50s classic becomes a ludicrous idea in this, effortlessly summarised by another reviewer here (thank you sir) as words to the effect of, "He terrorises and humiliates her so much that she has to shag him." I must say, though, Stone and Bates give class performances where and when they can - it's just Stone belongs in another film entirely, and Bates is given some classic quips but becomes a pawn in the filmmakers' race for the perfect, satisfying ending. Indeed, as other commentators have noted, halfway through they decide she is Columbo. "Just one more thing," she says, and I kid you not. Anyway, dears, the perfect, satisfying ending would have been for Bates to have locked everyone else in the school, including the scriptwriter and the director, and set fire to it. This film does nothing that you can't find in the French and Saunders videos on Youtube (try the classic "House of Idiot" or "Whatever Happened to Baby Dawn". Except embarrass you, appal you, and make you sick. But you know, there is a plus-side. The film ended!

    Character uses another to kill third one. Then the used character (always the less vicious and the more emotional) discovered the ugly truth of being used to serve hidden purposes for the first character and its hidden associate. Sometimes that associate could be the murdered party, sometimes the deceived could be a man or a woman, and many times it's from that deceived one's point of view. Since (Double Indemnity - 1944) this very formula in the Noir or the crime movies is so popular. Although there are endless ways to recycle and create through this old story, but most of the products along the years aren't excellent or even unpredictable. Based on a French movie or not, (Diabolique) isn't original or that good. It's even not convincing at places and rather idiot at others ! Since the whole thing is about killing the sick kind wife then why not to use less complicated ways? And if the husband is that sadistic deceitful why not to divorce him easily? And how oh how this husband brooked this amount of water for all of this time ? He must be Aquaman for god's sake ! Just like the gratuitous nudity here, the need for a lesbian relationship between the 2 women seemed for pure commercial purposes more than a dramatic motive (as a sexual tension between the 2 leads to make the audience hungry for love scene !). Yet, it's more powerful to watch (Stone) rescues (Adjani) at the end because she lastly felt the bound between them as 2 aggrieved women, not a "loving couple" where in this case the rescue becomes ordinary deed ?! Some of the situations looked so forced; such as the compulsory bad launch. Some of characters' reactions were so horribly bad; (Adjani) outrageously smiling among the professors at the lunch's table while she's supposed to be so sad and confused because of her husband's disappearance ! The intentions of (Kathy Bates)'s character were vague. There was no need for the character of the boy who peeks at his teacher nude ! Plus I didn't hear about a commercial that took this long to be filmed (clearly the 2 camera guys were living in the school for more than a week !??). The performance was truly laughable from (Isabelle Adjani)'s side. Along with being strangely not pretty sight this time, she dumbly was astounded, absentminded, sad, or scared all by the same goggled eyes ! Though she gave me so-provocative-it's-attractive acting to an extent that made the movie worth watching for a second time just for that ! I can't blame (Palmentieri) since the script dealt with him as a prototype scumbag. (Sharon Stone) did some fair acting; I think she was the only winner here. With a sluggish pace, and a story got no depth (for instance why it's a school, not a hotel ? a hospital ? or a company ??) you've got to ask yourself eventually why they didn't call it (scare your wife to death)?!, but Ah.. that could've ruined it. However with that ending it deserves a title like (treat women well otherwise they'll kill you) although it fits this story right but that could've ruined it too ! In fact the movie's finale makes it an explicit manifesto about how women, all the different kinds of women, CAN unite to kill one vile man and get away with it. So be aware of their anger because It's Woman Power baby ! A very sly notice : this movie came out one year after TV shows like Xena Warrior Princess (1995), and one year before another one : Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997).. I'll leave it to your intelligence to figure out the connections and what it could say about America of the mid-90s. However, in its core, all what the movie wanted is being a thriller with a different frame this time, to end up as one which's between average and poor despite the glow of it, especially with grand music, well cinematography, and interesting direction. To sum it all up I must tell : while it's a thrilling mystery this movie made me fall asleep in front of it. Sorry not that diabolic !

    The original here is one of the best thrillers, energetic in a way that distracts us from the revelation of the con. This is a lesser movie, but adds at least three clever ideas. If you are interested in narrative structure, you'll be interested in remakes of films and how they change. (I think these are changes to the original.) First, in true folding style, they added a film within the film. The film within is a recruiting film, but that hardly matters. Second, they changed the dynamic of the detective by making him a her. This allows for the third change but along the way the possibilities exist for the three types of women: the virgin, the whore and the shrew. It isn't played up well enough to matter, but its clear that someone's intuition was tuned. Third, there is a final twist that I think is quite different than the original's. It bonds the three women, already hinted in a lesbian tendency between the first two. But amazingly, the film didn't work well for me, probably because of pacing problems at various levels. Not that any level was off by the interplay of levels wasn't syncopated according to what engages. Its an intuitive process, I think, but quite rigid in its rules. Isabelle Adjani was cast perfectly, and introduced very skillfully. Beginnings are hard. This in its original incarnation was the first double con movie, I think. Adding a third was inevitable, I suppose. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.

    "Diabolique", a remake of the 1955 French horror/thriller "Les Diaboliques", centers on Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), a devout Catholic woman who is married to an abusive headmaster, Guy (Chazz Palminteri), with whom she runs an all boy's school. She is fairly close to his mistress, Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone), who is a teacher at the school, and the two conspire a plot to murder him. After the deed is done, they dispose of his body in the school's filthy swimming pool... but when the pool is drained, his body is gone, and strange things begin to haunt them, while a nosy detective (Kathy Bates) begins to catch onto the elaborate plot. To start off with, I consider the original "Les Diaboliques" one of the best horror movies of all time - it's painfully suspenseful, genuinely creepy, and has one of the best twist-endings I've ever seen. So, I went into this remake with fairly low expectations, and that may have been why I didn't mind it so much. I knew there was no possible way this re-imagining could out- do the original. So, with that said, I found this film to be a fairly entertaining thriller, even though I knew all the twists and turns of the plot ahead of time. The film takes place in modern day, but maintains a very 1950s feel, with the wardrobe and the old-fashioned architecture of the school. It's surprisingly pretty faithful to the original movie, too, with a few changes scattered about, some for the better and some for the worst. I thought the update of the murder scene was well executed, as was the climax of the film (again, even though I was aware of what to expect). However, as expected, we do have a very "Hollywood" ending - the movie follows the original closely until the last ten minutes, where the conclusion becomes what most American movie-goers would expect. I can't say it's necessarily that awful, and I wasn't expecting the writers to follow the cold, ambiguous conclusion the original had. I suppose I was a tad bit disappointed they didn't stick with the original ending, but what they did do with the new ending was clever. I'd say my biggest complaint here was the absence of ambiguity and suspense the original film upheld. The suspense was fairly secondhand in comparison, and I'd like to have seen improvement there. Acting-wise, I have mixed feelings. Sharon Stone, I felt, was fairly poor at times in her delivery and overall performance, while at other times she did quite well. Her performance was a bit topsy-turvy, but she was good enough, and does have the right 'look' for the part. Isabelle Adjani was great, she made her character very lovable, and her melancholy facial expressions were priceless. Chazz Palminteri was also good in the abusive, jerk-of-a-husband role. I also enjoyed Kathy Bates in the role of the detective, which was played by a male in the original. She's a great actress and played her quirky, offbeat role excellently. Overall, "Diabolique" is a bit of a mixed bag. I enjoyed it mainly because I found the re- imagining of the story an interesting idea, and the re-construction of some of those classic scenes was neat to watch. The problem with this film is if you see it before you see the 1955 version, you probably will enjoy it because the story and plot twists are really clever. However, if you've already seen the original, the story is essentially spoiled. I personally enjoyed watching the re-construction of it though, even with it's faults. I'd say this 1996 version of the story is a decent companion piece to the original - it's fairly entertaining, but can't hold a candle to the film it was based upon. 6/10.

    Mia is being abused by her husband Guy. It's too bad because Mia has heart problems. So her and her friend Nicole decide that Guy should have a little "accident." So they work together but Mia is all nervous and tense but Nicole is cool. Then they drain the pond and Mia starts to freak out. I keep thinking, "what is going on?" I really don't know if he is dead or alive or if someone pulled him out. Then I got to the end and I wasn't surprised because I had that idea in my head too. I couldn't really figure out whose side was whose. Where Mia and Nicole still working together? Then there is that detective with one breast that I thought that was involved but forget that. Forget this whole movie because it's way too confusing.

    I heard some really bad things about this remake of the classic French film 'Les Diaboliques', and I would never have expected it to be a patch on the brilliant original anyway; the only reason I even bothered to watch it is because it happened to be on TV, and there happened to be nothing else on. However, after the first half hour or so; while the film indeed is nothing on the original, it seemed like it was going to end up being a decent thriller. But then the problems start; the parts where the original's character reflected on what they'd done were the best parts of the film; here they're extremely boring, and that's where the film falls down. The plot is basically the same as the original and focuses on a school which is ran by a man with a wife and a mistress; neither of which like him. They decide that killing him would be a great idea, and promptly do it. However, after disposing of the body in the school swimming pool and later having it emptied; the body isn't there! And what's worse is that the women start to find clues that he may still be alive... It's a real shame that this film wasn't better as the two female leads are excellent. I'm not sure that I would have made it all the way to the end if it wasn't for the fact that I had the beautiful Isabelle Adjani to admire. It's not her greatest performance and she seems to be on autopilot, but she fits into the scared mousy role well. She is joined by Sharon Stone, who is brilliantly cast as Adjani's colder and more collected opposite number. Stone also looks good, which is certainly a bonus considering the shortcomings of the rest of the film. The problem with the second half of the film is really that it's not interesting, and there aren't enough other things going on to make up for it. There's a hint of a lesbian relationship between the two leads, though nothing really comes of it; definitely a big mistake considering how great they both look! Having already seen the original, the ending came as no surprise; but I'm certain that I could have guessed anyway as there soon becomes only one way that it can go. Overall, I could probably watch Isabelle Adjani all day long; but not when the film in question is this one. There's not much point bothering with this...see the original instead.

    Diabolique is set in Pennsylvania at the St. Anselm's boarding school for boys which is owned by Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), however her husband Guy (Chazz Palminteri) who runs the school treats her like dirt & cheats on her. Mia & a teacher named Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone) whom is one of Guy's many lovers devise a plan to kill him & make it look like an accident, the plan is to drown him & then throw him in the school pool where he will be found & to the police his death will seem like a simple drowning. However after a few days the body isn't found so Mia orders the dirty pool drained when Nicole 'accidently' drops her keys into it, once drained Guy's body is not there. Was Guy dead? Did someone find out there plan? Who knows... Directed by Jeremiah Chechik this is a remake of the black and white French film Les Diaboliques (1955) which itself was based on the novel 'Celle Qui N'Etait Plus' by Pierre Boileau & Thomas Narcejac & I thought was a fairly lazy & plodding mystery thriller with truly one of the worst twist endings ever. The humourless & slow moving script by Don Ross takes ages to do what the average episode of Columbo took about 10 minutes to, to show someone committing the so-called perfect murder. Then it switches to creepy thriller mode as the body vanishes from where the murderers left it & seemingly has come back to life before it all falls apart with one of the worst, most predictable & frankly unlikable twist endings ever. I can't continue my review any further without massive spoilers which will give away the ending so beware, anyway I hate the fact that Mia & Nicole suddenly turn into the heroes of the piece when they were just as bad as Guy since in the case of Mia she planned to kill him in cold blood & Nicole was prepared to trick Mia & ultimately kill her if the plan had succeeded. They were really unlikable character's to begin with so this horrible ending where they become the heroes by killing Guy which is basically exactly the same thing which they set out to do in the first place just grated my nerves. Also, if Mia was feeling so guilty why did she seem almost redeemed at the end? She still ended up killing Guy anyway so why the miraculous change of heart? Also, what about Nicole? She still was part of some scheme where someone was always going to die, be it either Mia or Guy. The ending is just so misjudged, it makes no sense with the rest of the context of the film, it's horribly acted & it's utterly predictable. In fact I guessed how this would end within 30 minutes & I was absolutely right in just about every detail. A really horrible film with an even worse ending, one to avoid. Director Chechik has made some really, really awful films & after this mess & his subsequent big screen adaptation of The Avengers (1998) which is considered one of the worst films ever made Hollywood thankfully hasn't let him anywhere near a film camera since. This guy should be directing traffic rather than films. This is blandly shot in dull autumnal colours which give it forgettable look. I also have to mention the acting, especially by the two female leads Stone & Adjani who are simply terrible. I hated their character's, I hated their acting & thought they were two of the worst performances by leading actors in a Hollywood flick I've ever seen. In the UK this is rated '18' meaning no-one under that age can watch it, I have no idea why as there's no violence worth mentioning, no nudity or sex & it's devoid of any action or excitement. Technically the film is alright but it's flat, dull & blandly filmed. There's no real style here & it's not a film I will remember in any way apart from that terrible ending. As I've said I think the acting by the two leads is simply awful. Diaboliques is a slow moving, utterly predictable thriller with a horrible ending that didn't do anything for me. One to avoid. This probably would have worked better as a 30 minute Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode or maybe even as an obscure black and white French film from the 50's...

    The classic French thriller Diabolique has a sturdy story, which is one reason why it is a target for remakes. The film was remade for American television twice - first as Reflections of Murder (featuring Tuesday Weld, Joan Hackett and Sam Waterston) and later as House of Secrets (with Melissa Gilbert and Bruce Boxleitner). To be honest, both of those remakes are certainly interesting to watch, if lacking in the suspense and novelty of the original. Reflections is fairly faithful to its parent, while House of Secrets maintains the bare bones of the storyline and throws in a different setting and some elements of voodoo. If you have not seen the original, the enjoyment level of both those films will be elevated. The same cannot be said for the first dunderheaded attempt to cinematically remake the French classic for American audiences. Keeping the original name, story and setting would seem a step in the right direction, but the film fails due to some incredibly foolish choices. The action takes place at a private boys prep school overseen by the hateful Chazz Palminteri. In between stealing funds from the school, Palminteri enjoys subjecting wife Isabelle Adjani - who suffers from a weak heart - to assorted cruelties. In his spare time, he engages in S&M with ice queen blond teacher Sharon Stone. The two women - tired of his abuse - decide to murder him, drop his body in the disgustingly filthy school pool and make it appear that he drowned in a drunken accident. Naturally, nothing goes according to plan. The best thing about this film is probably the casting of Sharon Stone in the role made famous by French actress Simone Signoret. If anyone embodies some of the same cunning and sensuality of Signoret from the original in a modern actress, it would be Stone. Unfortunately, the screenplay and everything around her fails to support her in any way. The changes made to the screenplay are not improvements. While a remake need not be slavishly faithful to the original, it should not completely go off the beaten path the way that this film does, particularly in its finale. The shock twist ending of the original may no longer be fresh, but the shaggy dog pseudo-feminist tilt tacked on to this latest effort seems to come completely from left field and is a blatant misfire. If Stone was an inspired choice, the remainder of the cast is less so. Isabelle Adjani, looking puffy and listless, is completely underwhelming as the abused wife. At no point does she engage our sympathy and she often seems entirely too lacking in energy to be remotely terrified. This may well be the most laid-back "frightened" performance one has ever seen on celluloid. Kathy Bates shows up as a detective investigating Palmineri's disappearance and driving the women to distraction. Her performance is immensely enjoyable and she seems to be having a good time. As a cancer survivor, she gets to crack completely inappropriate jokes and attempts to lay the groundwork for the "we're all sisters under the skin" meme that creeps into the film's finale. Unfortunately, her character and performance belongs in a completely different (and one would argue better) film. And the casting of Chazz Palminteri as the abusive schoolmaster is a disaster. Palminteri, providing the same performance here as he does in his guise of the reliable Mafia hit man roles in which he specializes, is laughably miscast. As tough as he comes off, Adjani could arguably physically match him and Stone could step on him without blinking twice. Not only that, but we have to believe that there was something that attracted these two attractive women to him and kept them in his orbit when they could easily have moved on. Palminteri, resembling a large trout, and playing a man with the charisma of a barracuda, seems an impossible prospect for these women. We have to believe that one lovely woman would fall for him (much less two) and no gigantic leap of faith can make this happen. Director Jeremiah Chechik has absolutely no idea how to maintain suspense or an atmosphere of foreboding. The scene shifts are klutzy and obvious. The pacing is often laborious, which allows the viewer time to mull over the complexities of the plots and double-crosses played out before us and realize how absurd the entire scenario truly is - something that the original (as well as its TV remakes) never allowed the viewer time to contemplate. This material needs a skilled hand, but what is provided is a clumsy sledgehammer. The original is noted especially for its shock ending. This remake seems initially to be going for the same thing and then suddenly backtracks - with remorseless characters suddenly developing consciences and people conducting themselves in ways not previously indicated in their respective behavior. By the time all of the leads end up in a watery fight, one realizes what a foolish level to which the film has sunk. One is sternly advised to locate either the original French classic or one of its TV counterparts before descending to this entry.

    Someone recently said "Hollywood hates originality". This is the unfortunate evidence. I can only guess that the few favorable reviews came from people who never experienced the original film or were just too lazy to watch a film in a foreign language. Clouzot's effort was magnificent way back in the '50's. This was just a sad attempt at some fast bucks with no talent in front of or behind the camera. In the original film, the background of the school was seedy and cheap, the characters were unattractive in general and the surroundings were oppressive. This "sanitized" version misses the original point entirely. There was little or no suspense and no "atmosphere" at all. What a stupid waste. Ditto the remake of "Rear Window" but that's another review again... Curtis Stotlar

    **SPOILERS** Decent remake of the French 1955 film noir classic of the same title about two women, wife and mistress, planning the murder of their both sleazy and ape-like husband and lover that ends up boomeranging on both of them. In this modernized version of "Diabolique" the story takes place in Pennsylvania not France with headmistress and owner of an all boys private school Mia Baran, Isabelle Adjani, having her fill of taking all the abuse she can from her caveman like husband Guy, Chezz Palminteri. Mia gets together with Guy's also abused mistress, who got her left eye blackened by him, Nicole Horner played by an ultra sexy looking Sharon Stone who's also a teacher at the boys school. The two abused women plan to finally do away with the creep and make his death look like a drowning accident. It takes a while for the very Catholic observing Mia to agree to Nicole's plan to murder Guy but the way he treats her,like dirt, pushes her over the edge in willing to do him in. Luring Guy away from the boys school where he resides both Nicoel and Mia have him secretly travel to a friends home, the Danzingers, in Pittsburgh where they plan to murder him. It's there that Mia got the brutish Guy drunk, which wasn't that hard top do, on booze that was spiked with a number of strong sleeping pills. With Guy out cold the two dumped him into the bathtub and with the help of what looked like a ten gallon bottle filled with water,to keep him from floating to the surface, ended up drowning him. It's when back at the boys school when Nicole & Mia dumped the boozed and drugged up as well as dead Guy into the school swimming pool that strange things started to happen! Guy not only didn't go to the bottom he didn't even go to the top of the pool? In fact he just plumb disappeared from sight over or under the water line! The rest of the movie has Mia, the weaker of the two murderesses, slowly going to pieces in not only what she did in murdering her husband but far worse in not knowing where his body is in order to give it a decent Catholic burial! Going to the local police to have them track down her missing husband Mia is spotted by retired lady detective Shirley Vogel, Kathy Bates, who smells a big story and takes over the investigation in the missing Guy Barnan. ***SPOILERS*** It doesn't take long for Vogel to realized that something isn't exactly kosher in Guy's mysterious disappearance. Checking out all the facts Vogel finds out that Guy was embezzling the funds for the boys school and planning to bankrupt it in order to throw off suspicion on himself by the local police. What's even more interesting is that Guy's partner in crime was non other then Nicoe Horner! His mistress whom, as Vogel soon suspects, was very possibly his murderer as well! The unexpected and shocking final in the film in fact outdoes the original, the 1955 French version, with the truth coming to the surface in what was the real reason in murdering Guy and who were the one's who cooked it up in the first place! This was enough to give you, like one of the principle characters in the movie, an almost fatal heart attack! The fact that the intended victim of this elaborately planned scheme didn't end up dropping dead from fright turned out to be disastrous for those who planned it!

    I've read through many perspectives on this film, and one that seems to crop up time and again is the word 'camp.' Unfortunately, the film never establishes itself as camp, or indeed anything. It's pointless. There being little to add to the dissection of this film's problems, let's concentrate for a second on how a script this revolting gets made into a film this unsatisfying. Firstly, you have to have a screenwriter who really wants to make a point about how he understands the original. But another trait he has to have is that he doesn't think many other people understand the original. Then, you have to have him working with a culture he doesn't understand. How Sharon Stone got a job in a Catholic boarding school is amazing! Let alone how Palmintieri could stand over his dying wife, or how a boy could break through into the headmaster's quarters, witness the entire scene, and not be sent away. I had nine years in boarding school, and not once, thankfully, did I get to see my headmaster bare-chested. I can understand the chap's fascination with his naked language teacher, and it's very plausible he might find his way to a window to watch from a distance, but he must be the most intuitive, caring boy in the world to have grasped that something was very wrong - and then, if he had done so, he would have gone straight for that adult that Palmintieri has to tell him to go and find. Perhaps he is desperately in love with Miss Adjani. Whatever. Then you have two other awful, awful pieces of writing/casting. (a) the video team - straight out of the 'Titanic' school of cheeky-chappy enthusiasts who say dude all the time and really don't give a fiddler's toss about anything other than the geeky enjoyment their jobs bring them. This kind of embarrasiing stereotyping wiped at least a star off my rating of 'Lock, Stock' (the scousers) and it's just insulting to camera technicians everywhere. Hollywood's presentation of enthusiasts has often been has often been unkind in a 'let's laugh at them' kind of way; here,it's unwatchable. And (b) the other members of staff. You kind of wish the two girls could have chosen their victims more wisely. That would have made the ending much more acceptable. While they were about it, they could also have knocked off that bug-eyed monster whom someone has come back later on in order to introduce a "mystery" element with the sunglasses. Then, you MUST have a director who wants to refer back to the original with as many 'atmosphere shots' as he can find. Probably in homage to it, but again, with no real point. In the original, the dripping tap serves a purpose of heightening the atmosphere of tension. In this film, there IS no tension until right near the end, when KB is wandering through the garage. But why is she wandering through the garage? So the director can 'explain' where Palmintieri has been hiding all this time. By trying to do the original film homage while making his own point about what a great scriptwriter he is (is he?) or what a great director he is (is he?), the person or persons most responsible for this film, clearly told to cut down on the length of the original, never pauses long enough to let anything sink in. Thus the rhythm of the piece goes sideways. And I found myself thinking there must have been a moment during production when some studio heads said, "But, you see, we MUST have some violence, and a chase, some nudity and a sex scene." What began life as a vicious rape of his wife in the 50s classic becomes a ludicrous idea in this, effortlessly summarised by another reviewer here (thank you sir) as words to the effect of, "He terrorises and humiliates her so much that she has to shag him." I must say, though, Stone and Bates give class performances where and when they can - it's just Stone belongs in another film entirely, and Bates is given some classic quips but becomes a pawn in the filmmakers' race for the perfect, satisfying ending. Indeed, as other commentators have noted, halfway through they decide she is Columbo. "Just one more thing," she says, and I kid you not. Anyway, dears, the perfect, satisfying ending would have been for Bates to have locked everyone else in the school, including the scriptwriter and the director, and set fire to it. This film does nothing that you can't find in the French and Saunders videos on Youtube (try the classic "House of Idiot" or "Whatever Happened to Baby Dawn". Except embarrass you, appal you, and make you sick. But you know, there is a plus-side. The film ended!

    Character uses another to kill third one. Then the used character (always the less vicious and the more emotional) discovered the ugly truth of being used to serve hidden purposes for the first character and its hidden associate. Sometimes that associate could be the murdered party, sometimes the deceived could be a man or a woman, and many times it's from that deceived one's point of view. Since (Double Indemnity - 1944) this very formula in the Noir or the crime movies is so popular. Although there are endless ways to recycle and create through this old story, but most of the products along the years aren't excellent or even unpredictable. Based on a French movie or not, (Diabolique) isn't original or that good. It's even not convincing at places and rather idiot at others ! Since the whole thing is about killing the sick kind wife then why not to use less complicated ways? And if the husband is that sadistic deceitful why not to divorce him easily? And how oh how this husband brooked this amount of water for all of this time ? He must be Aquaman for god's sake ! Just like the gratuitous nudity here, the need for a lesbian relationship between the 2 women seemed for pure commercial purposes more than a dramatic motive (as a sexual tension between the 2 leads to make the audience hungry for love scene !). Yet, it's more powerful to watch (Stone) rescues (Adjani) at the end because she lastly felt the bound between them as 2 aggrieved women, not a "loving couple" where in this case the rescue becomes ordinary deed ?! Some of the situations looked so forced; such as the compulsory bad launch. Some of characters' reactions were so horribly bad; (Adjani) outrageously smiling among the professors at the lunch's table while she's supposed to be so sad and confused because of her husband's disappearance ! The intentions of (Kathy Bates)'s character were vague. There was no need for the character of the boy who peeks at his teacher nude ! Plus I didn't hear about a commercial that took this long to be filmed (clearly the 2 camera guys were living in the school for more than a week !??). The performance was truly laughable from (Isabelle Adjani)'s side. Along with being strangely not pretty sight this time, she dumbly was astounded, absentminded, sad, or scared all by the same goggled eyes ! Though she gave me so-provocative-it's-attractive acting to an extent that made the movie worth watching for a second time just for that ! I can't blame (Palmentieri) since the script dealt with him as a prototype scumbag. (Sharon Stone) did some fair acting; I think she was the only winner here. With a sluggish pace, and a story got no depth (for instance why it's a school, not a hotel ? a hospital ? or a company ??) you've got to ask yourself eventually why they didn't call it (scare your wife to death)?!, but Ah.. that could've ruined it. However with that ending it deserves a title like (treat women well otherwise they'll kill you) although it fits this story right but that could've ruined it too ! In fact the movie's finale makes it an explicit manifesto about how women, all the different kinds of women, CAN unite to kill one vile man and get away with it. So be aware of their anger because It's Woman Power baby ! A very sly notice : this movie came out one year after TV shows like Xena Warrior Princess (1995), and one year before another one : Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997).. I'll leave it to your intelligence to figure out the connections and what it could say about America of the mid-90s. However, in its core, all what the movie wanted is being a thriller with a different frame this time, to end up as one which's between average and poor despite the glow of it, especially with grand music, well cinematography, and interesting direction. To sum it all up I must tell : while it's a thrilling mystery this movie made me fall asleep in front of it. Sorry not that diabolic !

    The original here is one of the best thrillers, energetic in a way that distracts us from the revelation of the con. This is a lesser movie, but adds at least three clever ideas. If you are interested in narrative structure, you'll be interested in remakes of films and how they change. (I think these are changes to the original.) First, in true folding style, they added a film within the film. The film within is a recruiting film, but that hardly matters. Second, they changed the dynamic of the detective by making him a her. This allows for the third change but along the way the possibilities exist for the three types of women: the virgin, the whore and the shrew. It isn't played up well enough to matter, but its clear that someone's intuition was tuned. Third, there is a final twist that I think is quite different than the original's. It bonds the three women, already hinted in a lesbian tendency between the first two. But amazingly, the film didn't work well for me, probably because of pacing problems at various levels. Not that any level was off by the interplay of levels wasn't syncopated according to what engages. Its an intuitive process, I think, but quite rigid in its rules. Isabelle Adjani was cast perfectly, and introduced very skillfully. Beginnings are hard. This in its original incarnation was the first double con movie, I think. Adding a third was inevitable, I suppose. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.

    "Diabolique", a remake of the 1955 French horror/thriller "Les Diaboliques", centers on Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), a devout Catholic woman who is married to an abusive headmaster, Guy (Chazz Palminteri), with whom she runs an all boy's school. She is fairly close to his mistress, Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone), who is a teacher at the school, and the two conspire a plot to murder him. After the deed is done, they dispose of his body in the school's filthy swimming pool... but when the pool is drained, his body is gone, and strange things begin to haunt them, while a nosy detective (Kathy Bates) begins to catch onto the elaborate plot. To start off with, I consider the original "Les Diaboliques" one of the best horror movies of all time - it's painfully suspenseful, genuinely creepy, and has one of the best twist-endings I've ever seen. So, I went into this remake with fairly low expectations, and that may have been why I didn't mind it so much. I knew there was no possible way this re-imagining could out- do the original. So, with that said, I found this film to be a fairly entertaining thriller, even though I knew all the twists and turns of the plot ahead of time. The film takes place in modern day, but maintains a very 1950s feel, with the wardrobe and the old-fashioned architecture of the school. It's surprisingly pretty faithful to the original movie, too, with a few changes scattered about, some for the better and some for the worst. I thought the update of the murder scene was well executed, as was the climax of the film (again, even though I was aware of what to expect). However, as expected, we do have a very "Hollywood" ending - the movie follows the original closely until the last ten minutes, where the conclusion becomes what most American movie-goers would expect. I can't say it's necessarily that awful, and I wasn't expecting the writers to follow the cold, ambiguous conclusion the original had. I suppose I was a tad bit disappointed they didn't stick with the original ending, but what they did do with the new ending was clever. I'd say my biggest complaint here was the absence of ambiguity and suspense the original film upheld. The suspense was fairly secondhand in comparison, and I'd like to have seen improvement there. Acting-wise, I have mixed feelings. Sharon Stone, I felt, was fairly poor at times in her delivery and overall performance, while at other times she did quite well. Her performance was a bit topsy-turvy, but she was good enough, and does have the right 'look' for the part. Isabelle Adjani was great, she made her character very lovable, and her melancholy facial expressions were priceless. Chazz Palminteri was also good in the abusive, jerk-of-a-husband role. I also enjoyed Kathy Bates in the role of the detective, which was played by a male in the original. She's a great actress and played her quirky, offbeat role excellently. Overall, "Diabolique" is a bit of a mixed bag. I enjoyed it mainly because I found the re- imagining of the story an interesting idea, and the re-construction of some of those classic scenes was neat to watch. The problem with this film is if you see it before you see the 1955 version, you probably will enjoy it because the story and plot twists are really clever. However, if you've already seen the original, the story is essentially spoiled. I personally enjoyed watching the re-construction of it though, even with it's faults. I'd say this 1996 version of the story is a decent companion piece to the original - it's fairly entertaining, but can't hold a candle to the film it was based upon. 6/10.

    Mia is being abused by her husband Guy. It's too bad because Mia has heart problems. So her and her friend Nicole decide that Guy should have a little "accident." So they work together but Mia is all nervous and tense but Nicole is cool. Then they drain the pond and Mia starts to freak out. I keep thinking, "what is going on?" I really don't know if he is dead or alive or if someone pulled him out. Then I got to the end and I wasn't surprised because I had that idea in my head too. I couldn't really figure out whose side was whose. Where Mia and Nicole still working together? Then there is that detective with one breast that I thought that was involved but forget that. Forget this whole movie because it's way too confusing.

    I heard some really bad things about this remake of the classic French film 'Les Diaboliques', and I would never have expected it to be a patch on the brilliant original anyway; the only reason I even bothered to watch it is because it happened to be on TV, and there happened to be nothing else on. However, after the first half hour or so; while the film indeed is nothing on the original, it seemed like it was going to end up being a decent thriller. But then the problems start; the parts where the original's character reflected on what they'd done were the best parts of the film; here they're extremely boring, and that's where the film falls down. The plot is basically the same as the original and focuses on a school which is ran by a man with a wife and a mistress; neither of which like him. They decide that killing him would be a great idea, and promptly do it. However, after disposing of the body in the school swimming pool and later having it emptied; the body isn't there! And what's worse is that the women start to find clues that he may still be alive... It's a real shame that this film wasn't better as the two female leads are excellent. I'm not sure that I would have made it all the way to the end if it wasn't for the fact that I had the beautiful Isabelle Adjani to admire. It's not her greatest performance and she seems to be on autopilot, but she fits into the scared mousy role well. She is joined by Sharon Stone, who is brilliantly cast as Adjani's colder and more collected opposite number. Stone also looks good, which is certainly a bonus considering the shortcomings of the rest of the film. The problem with the second half of the film is really that it's not interesting, and there aren't enough other things going on to make up for it. There's a hint of a lesbian relationship between the two leads, though nothing really comes of it; definitely a big mistake considering how great they both look! Having already seen the original, the ending came as no surprise; but I'm certain that I could have guessed anyway as there soon becomes only one way that it can go. Overall, I could probably watch Isabelle Adjani all day long; but not when the film in question is this one. There's not much point bothering with this...see the original instead.

    Diabolique is set in Pennsylvania at the St. Anselm's boarding school for boys which is owned by Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), however her husband Guy (Chazz Palminteri) who runs the school treats her like dirt & cheats on her. Mia & a teacher named Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone) whom is one of Guy's many lovers devise a plan to kill him & make it look like an accident, the plan is to drown him & then throw him in the school pool where he will be found & to the police his death will seem like a simple drowning. However after a few days the body isn't found so Mia orders the dirty pool drained when Nicole 'accidently' drops her keys into it, once drained Guy's body is not there. Was Guy dead? Did someone find out there plan? Who knows... Directed by Jeremiah Chechik this is a remake of the black and white French film Les Diaboliques (1955) which itself was based on the novel 'Celle Qui N'Etait Plus' by Pierre Boileau & Thomas Narcejac & I thought was a fairly lazy & plodding mystery thriller with truly one of the worst twist endings ever. The humourless & slow moving script by Don Ross takes ages to do what the average episode of Columbo took about 10 minutes to, to show someone committing the so-called perfect murder. Then it switches to creepy thriller mode as the body vanishes from where the murderers left it & seemingly has come back to life before it all falls apart with one of the worst, most predictable & frankly unlikable twist endings ever. I can't continue my review any further without massive spoilers which will give away the ending so beware, anyway I hate the fact that Mia & Nicole suddenly turn into the heroes of the piece when they were just as bad as Guy since in the case of Mia she planned to kill him in cold blood & Nicole was prepared to trick Mia & ultimately kill her if the plan had succeeded. They were really unlikable character's to begin with so this horrible ending where they become the heroes by killing Guy which is basically exactly the same thing which they set out to do in the first place just grated my nerves. Also, if Mia was feeling so guilty why did she seem almost redeemed at the end? She still ended up killing Guy anyway so why the miraculous change of heart? Also, what about Nicole? She still was part of some scheme where someone was always going to die, be it either Mia or Guy. The ending is just so misjudged, it makes no sense with the rest of the context of the film, it's horribly acted & it's utterly predictable. In fact I guessed how this would end within 30 minutes & I was absolutely right in just about every detail. A really horrible film with an even worse ending, one to avoid. Director Chechik has made some really, really awful films & after this mess & his subsequent big screen adaptation of The Avengers (1998) which is considered one of the worst films ever made Hollywood thankfully hasn't let him anywhere near a film camera since. This guy should be directing traffic rather than films. This is blandly shot in dull autumnal colours which give it forgettable look. I also have to mention the acting, especially by the two female leads Stone & Adjani who are simply terrible. I hated their character's, I hated their acting & thought they were two of the worst performances by leading actors in a Hollywood flick I've ever seen. In the UK this is rated '18' meaning no-one under that age can watch it, I have no idea why as there's no violence worth mentioning, no nudity or sex & it's devoid of any action or excitement. Technically the film is alright but it's flat, dull & blandly filmed. There's no real style here & it's not a film I will remember in any way apart from that terrible ending. As I've said I think the acting by the two leads is simply awful. Diaboliques is a slow moving, utterly predictable thriller with a horrible ending that didn't do anything for me. One to avoid. This probably would have worked better as a 30 minute Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode or maybe even as an obscure black and white French film from the 50's...
