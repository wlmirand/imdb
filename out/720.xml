    "First Knight" is full of action,romance,adventure and good humour.There is the ultimate good guy - King Arthur - and,in case you're in any doubt,a very nasty bad guy called Lord Malignant or something so close it makes no difference.It has the slightly fading elfin charm of Mr Richard Gere as the nimble swordsman Lancelot,a man who says he doesn't care whether he lives or dies which rather gives him the edge in the swordfights by which he earns a crust,almost literally sometimes. This is a fine physical performance which only loses its edge when he is forced to think rather than do. We know little of Lancelot's history - a bit like Shane - but the inference is that he is the scion of some nobleman;perhaps born on the wrong side of the blanket. Rescuing the Lady Guinevere (Miss Julia Ormond)from the evil Lord Malagant he falls instantly under her spell despite the fact that she is betrothed(for political purposes) to King Arthur. "The next time we meet you will kiss me",he says with a rueful grin. To be fair,Mr Gere spends quite a lot of time ruefully grinning,but he is rather good at it so why not? In Camelot at the celebration for King Arthur's forthcoming nuptials Lancelot does indeed win a kiss from Guinevere by winning some mediaeval form of Supermario to the acclaim of the gathered crowd and that brings him to the attention of the king(Mr Sean Connery). After joining the Round Table,Lancelot becomes a confidant of the King but his conscience is racked(cue for much brow - furrowing from Mr Gere) and the not - quite lovers are caught in an embrace by Arthur. Lord Malagant attacks Camelot,King Arthur is killed,Lancelot in turn kills Malagant and peace is restored to the kingdom.Huzzah!. Miss Julia Ormond is breathtakingly beautiful,Mr Sean Connery is the very epitome of integrity. Along with "The Black Shield of Falworth","First Knight" stands as Hollywood's finest entertaining take on mediaeval England. It sweeps one up from the start and deposits one rather breathlessly in a neverland Olde Worlde which never existed but should have done. No one in either movie actually says "yonder lies the castle of my fodder"but I rather wish they had.

    This movie was one of the best family movies . 10 out of 10 and for all of the complainers (try not to judge a book for its cover). The film is great and it displays values that a man should poses such as:courage love honor dignity faith and a lot more. I know that for all of you if a film does not have a sex scene or something tot laugh it is a bad film. Try to learn something!!! Excellent film to see with your family on a evening . Splendid casting! Great actors (all of them) Superb display of values! On my opinion today s generation should grow watching those kind of films instead of sf or others. Wonder why people turn out as they are today? See how they talk favorite music or movies....and it is enough to see what kind of person they are.

    First Knight is directed by jerry Zucker and co-written by Lorne Cameron, David Hoselton and William Nicholson. It stars Richard Gere, Sean Connery, Julia Ormond and Ben Cross. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Adam Greenberg. Lancelot (Gere) falls in love with Guinevere (Ormond), inconvenient since she is due to be married to King Arthur (Connery). Meanwhile, Malagant (Cross), who has been expelled from the Round Table, plots to seize power from Arthur and the rest of the Knights of the Round Table. This is a different Camelot, this is principally a period piece love triangle involving King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. To prepare for that instead of expecting a dashing all action picture full of magic and mystical malarkey, can only aid the viewing experience. This is mature well written stuff, very well crafted by Zucker and his team, though the production fluctuates in style (the fight scenes are averagely staged but everything looks gorgeous). Cast are mostly fine, where even though Gere looks odd, somehow out of place with the period, he turns in an acceptable performance considering the humanist screenplay to hand. Lack of chemistry between Connery and Ormond is a problem, while Cross barely registers as a villain of note. Goldsmith provides a heart lifting score, impressive given that he was brought in at the last minute when Maurice Jarre jumped ship. All told it's an enjoyable picture that doesn't linger long in the memory once finished. But I was armed with the knowledge of what sort of narrative I was getting. Had I paid to view it at the cinema on release, I'm pretty sure I would have been just a little miffed, especially given that we also had Braveheart and Rob Roy that year, two scorching hot period epics. 6/10

    I love this movie,Richard Gere (Lancelot) was the hero, that won the heart of Julia Ormond (Guinevere).In this movie she was to marry the King.Which she did even though she loved the first knight.When they met he was just a common man that fought for money. That is my mom's take on the epic tale of King Arther and Lancelot. Mine I love this movie as well, it is one of the best renditions . About the legend of Camelot, I have seen it has adventure lust. And forbidden love , between Lancelot and Guinevere! But this tale of the sorted love triangle, has a dark side like all movies. It has a villain Ben Cross (Maligant) a cruel black hearted monster. Whose sole purpose was to dethrone the King and claim Camelot as his own! Until his untimely demise , by the sword of the first knight!

    It never fails. Every Arthurian movie that has ever been reviewed on this site has some version of these "It's not accurate", It's not historic", "So and so Knight was not like that", "It didn't look like Arthur", "It didn't look like Lancelot", "It didn't look like Guinevere", etc. etc. This is when I get very worried about the would that is full of these people! This is the last time I am doing this because they clearly outnumber me. THERE IS NOTHING TO BE ACCURATE, FAITHFUL OR TRUTHFUL TO! They complain it is not faithful to FICTION. This is legend that was oral legend long before every being written down by anyone and it's been written down thousands of ways! I don't see these movies saying they are the movie of The Once and Future King. No, they are just one more telling of a what? A LEGEND! And, they even believe that this is a IMPORTANT THING! Get a life. Go outside some time. There is a REAL WORLD with REAL IMPORTANT PROBLEMS and CHALLENGES out there. Try worrying about them instead of raging that Richard Gear did not LOOK like LANCELOT (because I have a polaroid of the real one and he looks just like Gear ;). I mean, just how lame can you get (obviously an infinite amount.) I give this movie a 10 just to balance it out. Besides, I think it's a fun film! And as it's impossible for it to be historicity accurate, I don't have to worry about such foolishness.

    Better than doing nothing I suppose. If you have popcorn to go with it. The only resemblance to Arthurian legend are the names and a little of the plot. Probably would have been better if they just made up a mythological kingdom and characters. This is a terrible attempt to tell the story of Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere. Evidently all the money invested in this went to the actor's salaries. The Costumes look like they came from GoodWill Industries and the armour looks like it was made of recycled aluminum cans. Sean Connery is a great actor, but too old (IMHO) to play Arthur. Gere is horrible as Lancelot. If you want a good movie about King Arthur, get Excalibur.

    I was not terribly impressed with First Knight. It tells the eternal triangle story between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot, and shoehorns in a couple of battle set pieces as part of a subplot concerning baddie Prince Malagant seemingly just for the sake of it. The film seems conceived as a vehicle for Richard Gere, although he seems singularly ill at ease throughout it and, for my money, Julia Ormond walks away with the movie. Even Sean Connery gives the impression of phoning it in. Ben Cross' Malagant is perilously close to pantomime villainy. The production values look high but not terribly convincing and the battle sequences are, frankly, poor - lots of clacking together of swords (a la 1950s swashbucklers) with lots of modern blood, but practically no convincing engagement between participants. I suppose this would pass a couple of hours if there was nothing else on TV and you didn't have a good book.

    Most people who saw this movie said that it was bad, and I expected it to be as well, but I decided to watch it anyway. The thing that sort of put me off the movie is that it was about the affair that Lancelot has with Guinevere, and that is something that I never really appreciated. I was expecting there to be a justified affair, which it is not, but this movie did turn out quite differently. In fact I ended up enjoying it. The first thing that I must say is that the cinematography and the sets were quite good. They created an impression of a real place of legend. The realm of Camelot came across as a legendary place which has been lost in the midsts of time. Unfortunately the screenwriters adapted the background of the story a lot - though the main push was that of the love triangle between Lancelot, Arthur, and Guinevere. The changes were immense. In the original story (not that I have read it, but I am going by the movie Excalibur and the mini-series Merlin) Guinevere was a lady that Arthur met at a party and asked Merlin to set them up. In fact Merlin did not even appear in this film, but then it was not his film. Even so, Merlin is an important character as he is Arthur's adviser. In this film, Guinevere was a lady in a realm bordering hostile territory and she was going to marry Arthur for love and political protection. The enemy was Prince Malagant, who was once Arthur's First Knight. He rebelled and is now wanting to destroy Arthur. Malagant is a constant threat, but the thrust is the love between Lancelot and Guinevere. They first meet when Lancelot saves her from Malagant's thugs, and then leads her back to the road. His character is of a roaming knight who charms ladies and does good for no reason, except that he wants to protect the weak. This is because in his past he watched his family be slaughtered in a burning church, and he now seeks to prevent that from happening to others. After they rescue Guinevere's province a boy approaches Lancelot and asks if he can go home. This is a direct reflection of Lancelot's pain as he no longer has a home to go to. His greatest struggle is the love he has for Guinevere, and his service to Arthur. He never wanted to join Arthur because he knew that he would betray him, but Arthur insisted that he do it. He is never far away though because he knows that Malagant wants to force Arthur into an uncompromising situation. But Malagant is only a supporting character, the real struggles comes in the conversations between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot. These occur where the characters struggle to understand their emotions and how they feel for each other. Arthur is not too sure, he has never married and is not interested in marriage, unless the right woman comes along, and he wants this woman to be Guinevere. Yet he is not sure, and while talking with her, he is trying to convince himself that this is the right choice to make. He is afraid of being hurt, and unfortunately this is what happens. He wants love and when he catches Lancelot and Guinevere kissing, he realises that this is not what he has. Guinevere says that she loves him, but he is not convinced, "show me the look you gave him." It is all about love, and he wants the love in the heart, but not in the head. Yet Arthur is a very level headed man. Most men, especially in those days, would have removed Lancelot's head without a second thought. Instead, he arrests Lancelot and puts him on trial in front of the entire land. This is probably was not the best idea because he is bringing a personal matter and exposing it to the people. He is putting Lancelot and Guinevere to shame with such a thing - something that Lancelot does not want. Of course, the threat of Malagant is always present.

    Mighty and pretty spectacle about Lancelot , King Arthur , Guinevere and the famous romance in color magnificence . This spectacular production from Jerry Zucker that gave you &uml;Ghost and Airplane&uml; among others and only Columbia TriStar could bring it so magnificently to the screen including a majestic soundtrack and splendid cinematography . The classic story of romantic adventure come to life enriched in glamorous color and with such great stars as Richard Gere (roving spirit Lancelot), Julia Ormond (wonderful Guinevere), and of course the great Sean Connery (upright Arthur) in the classic love triangle . Restless Lancelot who lives by his wits falls in love with Guinevere, who is due to be married to King Arthur . Meanwhile, a violent warlord attempts to seize power from Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table , as they set out in fight against the traitor Prince Malagant (Ben Cross), a Sir Mordred-alike . Whilst in the meantime the bride Guinevere and Sir Lancelot betray the king in their own way . Adding the apparition of knights of the round table as Sir Kay (Christopher Villiers) , Agravaine (Liam Cunningham) , Sir Patrise (Valentine Pelka) and Sir Mador (McCormack) , though there doesn't turns up neither Merlin , nor Morgana LeFay and all things supernatural are out of this flick . This is an overwhelming tale with adventures, villainy,romance and heroism in the grandeur of big screen although in television set is lost its splendor . This sweeping movie displays adventures , thrills , a romantic love story , breathtaking battles and epic confrontation with a terrific climax final for a mortal confrontation . Excellent main cast as an attractive Richard Gere , a gorgeous Julia Ormond , and exceptional , as always , Sean Connery as Arthur , an aged and war-weary king who is forced to go to battle one last time . Rousing battle scenes with impressive production design by John Box , though is also used computer generator . Excellent settings , the castles ,outdoors and tournaments or jousts are well staged . Handsome story well written by William Nicholson though contains some awkward narrative elements . Luscious costumes and gowns specially suited for Julia Ormond . Colorful wide-screen cinematography by stylish cameraman Adam Greenberg . Emotive and sensational musical score by the classic Jerry Goldsmith . However this epic film never takes off as it should despite of pomp and circumstance showed . The motion picture is imaginatively directed by Jerry Zucker working at the peak of his powers . Other movies on the matter of legends of Arthur are the following : MGM's first wide-screen film titled &uml;Knights of the Round Table&uml; 1953 ( by Richard Thorpe) , the musical &uml;Camelot&uml;(Joshua Logan) , the fantastic &uml;Excalibur&uml;(John Boorman) and recently &uml;King Arthur&uml;(Antoine Fuqua). The picture will appeal to aficionados with chivalric ideals and historic movies fans , it is a fine production that will lose much on small television screen . This spellbinding film is freely inspired on legends and supposedly based on facts and famed personages . In spite of there aren't real documents about legendary feats King Arthur , allegedly in VI century he was King of Bretons and then were created in 12th century some writings by notorious French authors who romanticized the legend as Chretien of Troyes , Thomas Malory that wrote the Breton series with their knights looking for the Holy Grail . Besides Godofredo of Mormouth publicized in 1136 the History Regnum Britanniae and in XX century John Steinbeck wrote about the events of King Arthur . The story concerns when the Romans had withdrawn Britain and the Empire dissolved into chaos,then rules the king Arthur, he achieved to maintain the Christianity and civilization in the west of England ,though no exactly congruent with the VI century , time was presumed to have lived but the film is developed in a high medieval panoply .

    Better than doing nothing I suppose. If you have popcorn to go with it. The only resemblance to Arthurian legend are the names and a little of the plot. Probably would have been better if they just made up a mythological kingdom and characters. This is a terrible attempt to tell the story of Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere. Evidently all the money invested in this went to the actor's salaries. The Costumes look like they came from GoodWill Industries and the armour looks like it was made of recycled aluminum cans. Sean Connery is a great actor, but too old (IMHO) to play Arthur. Gere is horrible as Lancelot. If you want a good movie about King Arthur, get Excalibur.

    I was not terribly impressed with First Knight. It tells the eternal triangle story between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot, and shoehorns in a couple of battle set pieces as part of a subplot concerning baddie Prince Malagant seemingly just for the sake of it. The film seems conceived as a vehicle for Richard Gere, although he seems singularly ill at ease throughout it and, for my money, Julia Ormond walks away with the movie. Even Sean Connery gives the impression of phoning it in. Ben Cross' Malagant is perilously close to pantomime villainy. The production values look high but not terribly convincing and the battle sequences are, frankly, poor - lots of clacking together of swords (a la 1950s swashbucklers) with lots of modern blood, but practically no convincing engagement between participants. I suppose this would pass a couple of hours if there was nothing else on TV and you didn't have a good book.

    Most people who saw this movie said that it was bad, and I expected it to be as well, but I decided to watch it anyway. The thing that sort of put me off the movie is that it was about the affair that Lancelot has with Guinevere, and that is something that I never really appreciated. I was expecting there to be a justified affair, which it is not, but this movie did turn out quite differently. In fact I ended up enjoying it. The first thing that I must say is that the cinematography and the sets were quite good. They created an impression of a real place of legend. The realm of Camelot came across as a legendary place which has been lost in the midsts of time. Unfortunately the screenwriters adapted the background of the story a lot - though the main push was that of the love triangle between Lancelot, Arthur, and Guinevere. The changes were immense. In the original story (not that I have read it, but I am going by the movie Excalibur and the mini-series Merlin) Guinevere was a lady that Arthur met at a party and asked Merlin to set them up. In fact Merlin did not even appear in this film, but then it was not his film. Even so, Merlin is an important character as he is Arthur's adviser. In this film, Guinevere was a lady in a realm bordering hostile territory and she was going to marry Arthur for love and political protection. The enemy was Prince Malagant, who was once Arthur's First Knight. He rebelled and is now wanting to destroy Arthur. Malagant is a constant threat, but the thrust is the love between Lancelot and Guinevere. They first meet when Lancelot saves her from Malagant's thugs, and then leads her back to the road. His character is of a roaming knight who charms ladies and does good for no reason, except that he wants to protect the weak. This is because in his past he watched his family be slaughtered in a burning church, and he now seeks to prevent that from happening to others. After they rescue Guinevere's province a boy approaches Lancelot and asks if he can go home. This is a direct reflection of Lancelot's pain as he no longer has a home to go to. His greatest struggle is the love he has for Guinevere, and his service to Arthur. He never wanted to join Arthur because he knew that he would betray him, but Arthur insisted that he do it. He is never far away though because he knows that Malagant wants to force Arthur into an uncompromising situation. But Malagant is only a supporting character, the real struggles comes in the conversations between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot. These occur where the characters struggle to understand their emotions and how they feel for each other. Arthur is not too sure, he has never married and is not interested in marriage, unless the right woman comes along, and he wants this woman to be Guinevere. Yet he is not sure, and while talking with her, he is trying to convince himself that this is the right choice to make. He is afraid of being hurt, and unfortunately this is what happens. He wants love and when he catches Lancelot and Guinevere kissing, he realises that this is not what he has. Guinevere says that she loves him, but he is not convinced, "show me the look you gave him." It is all about love, and he wants the love in the heart, but not in the head. Yet Arthur is a very level headed man. Most men, especially in those days, would have removed Lancelot's head without a second thought. Instead, he arrests Lancelot and puts him on trial in front of the entire land. This is probably was not the best idea because he is bringing a personal matter and exposing it to the people. He is putting Lancelot and Guinevere to shame with such a thing - something that Lancelot does not want. Of course, the threat of Malagant is always present.

Meanwhile, a violent warlord attempts to seize power from Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table , as they set out in fight against the traitor Prince Malagant (Ben Cross), a Sir Mordred-alike . Whilst in the meantime the bride Guinevere and Sir Lancelot betray the king in their own way . Adding the apparition of knights of the round table as Sir Kay (Christopher Villiers) , Agravaine (Liam Cunningham) , Sir Patrise (Valentine Pelka) and Sir Mador (McCormack) , though there doesn't turns up neither Merlin , nor Morgana LeFay and all things supernatural are out of this flick . This is an overwhelming tale with adventures, villainy,romance and heroism in the grandeur of big screen although in television set is lost its splendor . This sweeping movie displays adventures , thrills , a romantic love story , breathtaking battles and epic confrontation with a terrific climax final for a mortal confrontation . Excellent main cast as an attractive Richard Gere , a gorgeous Julia Ormond , and exceptional , as always , Sean Connery as Arthur , an aged and war-weary king who is forced to go to battle one last time . Rousing battle scenes with impressive production design by John Box , though is also used computer generator . Excellent settings , the castles ,outdoors and tournaments or jousts are well staged .

The picture will appeal to aficionados with chivalric ideals and historic movies fans , it is a fine production that will lose much on small television screen . This spellbinding film is freely inspired on legends and supposedly based on facts and famed personages . In spite of there aren't real documents about legendary feats King Arthur , allegedly in VI century he was King of Bretons and then were created in 12th century some writings by notorious French authors who romanticized the legend as Chretien of Troyes , Thomas Malory that wrote the Breton series with their knights looking for the Holy Grail .

    "First Knight" is full of action,romance,adventure and good humour.There is the ultimate good guy - King Arthur - and,in case you're in any doubt,a very nasty bad guy called Lord Malignant or something so close it makes no difference.It has the slightly fading elfin charm of Mr Richard Gere as the nimble swordsman Lancelot,a man who says he doesn't care whether he lives or dies which rather gives him the edge in the swordfights by which he earns a crust,almost literally sometimes. This is a fine physical performance which only loses its edge when he is forced to think rather than do. We know little of Lancelot's history - a bit like Shane - but the inference is that he is the scion of some nobleman;perhaps born on the wrong side of the blanket. Rescuing the Lady Guinevere (Miss Julia Ormond)from the evil Lord Malagant he falls instantly under her spell despite the fact that she is betrothed(for political purposes) to King Arthur. "The next time we meet you will kiss me",he says with a rueful grin. To be fair,Mr Gere spends quite a lot of time ruefully grinning,but he is rather good at it so why not? In Camelot at the celebration for King Arthur's forthcoming nuptials Lancelot does indeed win a kiss from Guinevere by winning some mediaeval form of Supermario to the acclaim of the gathered crowd and that brings him to the attention of the king(Mr Sean Connery). After joining the Round Table,Lancelot becomes a confidant of the King but his conscience is racked(cue for much brow - furrowing from Mr Gere) and the not - quite lovers are caught in an embrace by Arthur. Lord Malagant attacks Camelot,King Arthur is killed,Lancelot in turn kills Malagant and peace is restored to the kingdom.Huzzah!. Miss Julia Ormond is breathtakingly beautiful,Mr Sean Connery is the very epitome of integrity. Along with "The Black Shield of Falworth","First Knight" stands as Hollywood's finest entertaining take on mediaeval England. It sweeps one up from the start and deposits one rather breathlessly in a neverland Olde Worlde which never existed but should have done. No one in either movie actually says "yonder lies the castle of my fodder"but I rather wish they had.

    This movie was one of the best family movies . 10 out of 10 and for all of the complainers (try not to judge a book for its cover). The film is great and it displays values that a man should poses such as:courage love honor dignity faith and a lot more. I know that for all of you if a film does not have a sex scene or something tot laugh it is a bad film. Try to learn something!!! Excellent film to see with your family on a evening . Splendid casting! Great actors (all of them) Superb display of values! On my opinion today s generation should grow watching those kind of films instead of sf or others. Wonder why people turn out as they are today? See how they talk favorite music or movies....and it is enough to see what kind of person they are.

    First Knight is directed by jerry Zucker and co-written by Lorne Cameron, David Hoselton and William Nicholson. It stars Richard Gere, Sean Connery, Julia Ormond and Ben Cross. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Adam Greenberg. Lancelot (Gere) falls in love with Guinevere (Ormond), inconvenient since she is due to be married to King Arthur (Connery). Meanwhile, Malagant (Cross), who has been expelled from the Round Table, plots to seize power from Arthur and the rest of the Knights of the Round Table. This is a different Camelot, this is principally a period piece love triangle involving King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. To prepare for that instead of expecting a dashing all action picture full of magic and mystical malarkey, can only aid the viewing experience. This is mature well written stuff, very well crafted by Zucker and his team, though the production fluctuates in style (the fight scenes are averagely staged but everything looks gorgeous). Cast are mostly fine, where even though Gere looks odd, somehow out of place with the period, he turns in an acceptable performance considering the humanist screenplay to hand. Lack of chemistry between Connery and Ormond is a problem, while Cross barely registers as a villain of note. Goldsmith provides a heart lifting score, impressive given that he was brought in at the last minute when Maurice Jarre jumped ship. All told it's an enjoyable picture that doesn't linger long in the memory once finished. But I was armed with the knowledge of what sort of narrative I was getting. Had I paid to view it at the cinema on release, I'm pretty sure I would have been just a little miffed, especially given that we also had Braveheart and Rob Roy that year, two scorching hot period epics. 6/10

    I love this movie,Richard Gere (Lancelot) was the hero, that won the heart of Julia Ormond (Guinevere).In this movie she was to marry the King.Which she did even though she loved the first knight.When they met he was just a common man that fought for money. That is my mom's take on the epic tale of King Arther and Lancelot. Mine I love this movie as well, it is one of the best renditions . About the legend of Camelot, I have seen it has adventure lust. And forbidden love , between Lancelot and Guinevere! But this tale of the sorted love triangle, has a dark side like all movies. It has a villain Ben Cross (Maligant) a cruel black hearted monster. Whose sole purpose was to dethrone the King and claim Camelot as his own! Until his untimely demise , by the sword of the first knight!

    It never fails. Every Arthurian movie that has ever been reviewed on this site has some version of these "It's not accurate", It's not historic", "So and so Knight was not like that", "It didn't look like Arthur", "It didn't look like Lancelot", "It didn't look like Guinevere", etc. etc. This is when I get very worried about the would that is full of these people! This is the last time I am doing this because they clearly outnumber me. THERE IS NOTHING TO BE ACCURATE, FAITHFUL OR TRUTHFUL TO! They complain it is not faithful to FICTION. This is legend that was oral legend long before every being written down by anyone and it's been written down thousands of ways! I don't see these movies saying they are the movie of The Once and Future King. No, they are just one more telling of a what? A LEGEND! And, they even believe that this is a IMPORTANT THING! Get a life. Go outside some time. There is a REAL WORLD with REAL IMPORTANT PROBLEMS and CHALLENGES out there. Try worrying about them instead of raging that Richard Gear did not LOOK like LANCELOT (because I have a polaroid of the real one and he looks just like Gear ;). I mean, just how lame can you get (obviously an infinite amount.) I give this movie a 10 just to balance it out. Besides, I think it's a fun film! And as it's impossible for it to be historicity accurate, I don't have to worry about such foolishness.

Probably would have been better if they just made up a mythological kingdom and characters. This is a terrible attempt to tell the story of Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere. Evidently all the money invested in this went to the actor's salaries. The Costumes look like they came from GoodWill Industries and the armour looks like it was made of recycled aluminum cans. Sean Connery is a great actor, but too old (IMHO) to play Arthur. Gere is horrible as Lancelot. If you want a good movie about King Arthur, get Excalibur.

    This movie was one of the best family movies . 10 out of 10 and for all of the complainers (try not to judge a book for its cover). The film is great and it displays values that a man should poses such as:courage love honor dignity faith and a lot more. I know that for all of you if a film does not have a sex scene or something tot laugh it is a bad film. Try to learn something!!! Excellent film to see with your family on a evening . Splendid casting! Great actors (all of them) Superb display of values! On my opinion today s generation should grow watching those kind of films instead of sf or others. Wonder why people turn out as they are today? See how they talk favorite music or movies....and it is enough to see what kind of person they are.

    First Knight is directed by jerry Zucker and co-written by Lorne Cameron, David Hoselton and William Nicholson. It stars Richard Gere, Sean Connery, Julia Ormond and Ben Cross. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Adam Greenberg. Lancelot (Gere) falls in love with Guinevere (Ormond), inconvenient since she is due to be married to King Arthur (Connery). Meanwhile, Malagant (Cross), who has been expelled from the Round Table, plots to seize power from Arthur and the rest of the Knights of the Round Table. This is a different Camelot, this is principally a period piece love triangle involving King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. To prepare for that instead of expecting a dashing all action picture full of magic and mystical malarkey, can only aid the viewing experience. This is mature well written stuff, very well crafted by Zucker and his team, though the production fluctuates in style (the fight scenes are averagely staged but everything looks gorgeous). Cast are mostly fine, where even though Gere looks odd, somehow out of place with the period, he turns in an acceptable performance considering the humanist screenplay to hand. Lack of chemistry between Connery and Ormond is a problem, while Cross barely registers as a villain of note. Goldsmith provides a heart lifting score, impressive given that he was brought in at the last minute when Maurice Jarre jumped ship. All told it's an enjoyable picture that doesn't linger long in the memory once finished. But I was armed with the knowledge of what sort of narrative I was getting. Had I paid to view it at the cinema on release, I'm pretty sure I would have been just a little miffed, especially given that we also had Braveheart and Rob Roy that year, two scorching hot period epics. 6/10

    I love this movie,Richard Gere (Lancelot) was the hero, that won the heart of Julia Ormond (Guinevere).In this movie she was to marry the King.Which she did even though she loved the first knight.When they met he was just a common man that fought for money. That is my mom's take on the epic tale of King Arther and Lancelot. Mine I love this movie as well, it is one of the best renditions . About the legend of Camelot, I have seen it has adventure lust. And forbidden love , between Lancelot and Guinevere! But this tale of the sorted love triangle, has a dark side like all movies. It has a villain Ben Cross (Maligant) a cruel black hearted monster. Whose sole purpose was to dethrone the King and claim Camelot as his own! Until his untimely demise , by the sword of the first knight!

    It never fails. Every Arthurian movie that has ever been reviewed on this site has some version of these "It's not accurate", It's not historic", "So and so Knight was not like that", "It didn't look like Arthur", "It didn't look like Lancelot", "It didn't look like Guinevere", etc. etc. This is when I get very worried about the would that is full of these people! This is the last time I am doing this because they clearly outnumber me. THERE IS NOTHING TO BE ACCURATE, FAITHFUL OR TRUTHFUL TO! They complain it is not faithful to FICTION. This is legend that was oral legend long before every being written down by anyone and it's been written down thousands of ways! I don't see these movies saying they are the movie of The Once and Future King. No, they are just one more telling of a what? A LEGEND! And, they even believe that this is a IMPORTANT THING! Get a life. Go outside some time. There is a REAL WORLD with REAL IMPORTANT PROBLEMS and CHALLENGES out there. Try worrying about them instead of raging that Richard Gear did not LOOK like LANCELOT (because I have a polaroid of the real one and he looks just like Gear ;). I mean, just how lame can you get (obviously an infinite amount.) I give this movie a 10 just to balance it out. Besides, I think it's a fun film! And as it's impossible for it to be historicity accurate, I don't have to worry about such foolishness.

    Better than doing nothing I suppose. If you have popcorn to go with it. The only resemblance to Arthurian legend are the names and a little of the plot. Probably would have been better if they just made up a mythological kingdom and characters. This is a terrible attempt to tell the story of Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere. Evidently all the money invested in this went to the actor's salaries. The Costumes look like they came from GoodWill Industries and the armour looks like it was made of recycled aluminum cans. Sean Connery is a great actor, but too old (IMHO) to play Arthur. Gere is horrible as Lancelot. If you want a good movie about King Arthur, get Excalibur.

    I was not terribly impressed with First Knight. It tells the eternal triangle story between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot, and shoehorns in a couple of battle set pieces as part of a subplot concerning baddie Prince Malagant seemingly just for the sake of it. The film seems conceived as a vehicle for Richard Gere, although he seems singularly ill at ease throughout it and, for my money, Julia Ormond walks away with the movie. Even Sean Connery gives the impression of phoning it in. Ben Cross' Malagant is perilously close to pantomime villainy. The production values look high but not terribly convincing and the battle sequences are, frankly, poor - lots of clacking together of swords (a la 1950s swashbucklers) with lots of modern blood, but practically no convincing engagement between participants. I suppose this would pass a couple of hours if there was nothing else on TV and you didn't have a good book.

    Most people who saw this movie said that it was bad, and I expected it to be as well, but I decided to watch it anyway. The thing that sort of put me off the movie is that it was about the affair that Lancelot has with Guinevere, and that is something that I never really appreciated. I was expecting there to be a justified affair, which it is not, but this movie did turn out quite differently. In fact I ended up enjoying it. The first thing that I must say is that the cinematography and the sets were quite good. They created an impression of a real place of legend. The realm of Camelot came across as a legendary place which has been lost in the midsts of time. Unfortunately the screenwriters adapted the background of the story a lot - though the main push was that of the love triangle between Lancelot, Arthur, and Guinevere. The changes were immense. In the original story (not that I have read it, but I am going by the movie Excalibur and the mini-series Merlin) Guinevere was a lady that Arthur met at a party and asked Merlin to set them up. In fact Merlin did not even appear in this film, but then it was not his film. Even so, Merlin is an important character as he is Arthur's adviser. In this film, Guinevere was a lady in a realm bordering hostile territory and she was going to marry Arthur for love and political protection. The enemy was Prince Malagant, who was once Arthur's First Knight. He rebelled and is now wanting to destroy Arthur. Malagant is a constant threat, but the thrust is the love between Lancelot and Guinevere. They first meet when Lancelot saves her from Malagant's thugs, and then leads her back to the road. His character is of a roaming knight who charms ladies and does good for no reason, except that he wants to protect the weak. This is because in his past he watched his family be slaughtered in a burning church, and he now seeks to prevent that from happening to others. After they rescue Guinevere's province a boy approaches Lancelot and asks if he can go home. This is a direct reflection of Lancelot's pain as he no longer has a home to go to. His greatest struggle is the love he has for Guinevere, and his service to Arthur. He never wanted to join Arthur because he knew that he would betray him, but Arthur insisted that he do it. He is never far away though because he knows that Malagant wants to force Arthur into an uncompromising situation. But Malagant is only a supporting character, the real struggles comes in the conversations between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot. These occur where the characters struggle to understand their emotions and how they feel for each other. Arthur is not too sure, he has never married and is not interested in marriage, unless the right woman comes along, and he wants this woman to be Guinevere. Yet he is not sure, and while talking with her, he is trying to convince himself that this is the right choice to make. He is afraid of being hurt, and unfortunately this is what happens. He wants love and when he catches Lancelot and Guinevere kissing, he realises that this is not what he has. Guinevere says that she loves him, but he is not convinced, "show me the look you gave him." It is all about love, and he wants the love in the heart, but not in the head. Yet Arthur is a very level headed man. Most men, especially in those days, would have removed Lancelot's head without a second thought. Instead, he arrests Lancelot and puts him on trial in front of the entire land. This is probably was not the best idea because he is bringing a personal matter and exposing it to the people. He is putting Lancelot and Guinevere to shame with such a thing - something that Lancelot does not want. Of course, the threat of Malagant is always present.

    Mighty and pretty spectacle about Lancelot , King Arthur , Guinevere and the famous romance in color magnificence . This spectacular production from Jerry Zucker that gave you &uml;Ghost and Airplane&uml; among others and only Columbia TriStar could bring it so magnificently to the screen including a majestic soundtrack and splendid cinematography . The classic story of romantic adventure come to life enriched in glamorous color and with such great stars as Richard Gere (roving spirit Lancelot), Julia Ormond (wonderful Guinevere), and of course the great Sean Connery (upright Arthur) in the classic love triangle . Restless Lancelot who lives by his wits falls in love with Guinevere, who is due to be married to King Arthur . Meanwhile, a violent warlord attempts to seize power from Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table , as they set out in fight against the traitor Prince Malagant (Ben Cross), a Sir Mordred-alike . Whilst in the meantime the bride Guinevere and Sir Lancelot betray the king in their own way . Adding the apparition of knights of the round table as Sir Kay (Christopher Villiers) , Agravaine (Liam Cunningham) , Sir Patrise (Valentine Pelka) and Sir Mador (McCormack) , though there doesn't turns up neither Merlin , nor Morgana LeFay and all things supernatural are out of this flick . This is an overwhelming tale with adventures, villainy,romance and heroism in the grandeur of big screen although in television set is lost its splendor . This sweeping movie displays adventures , thrills , a romantic love story , breathtaking battles and epic confrontation with a terrific climax final for a mortal confrontation . Excellent main cast as an attractive Richard Gere , a gorgeous Julia Ormond , and exceptional , as always , Sean Connery as Arthur , an aged and war-weary king who is forced to go to battle one last time . Rousing battle scenes with impressive production design by John Box , though is also used computer generator . Excellent settings , the castles ,outdoors and tournaments or jousts are well staged . Handsome story well written by William Nicholson though contains some awkward narrative elements . Luscious costumes and gowns specially suited for Julia Ormond . Colorful wide-screen cinematography by stylish cameraman Adam Greenberg . Emotive and sensational musical score by the classic Jerry Goldsmith . However this epic film never takes off as it should despite of pomp and circumstance showed . The motion picture is imaginatively directed by Jerry Zucker working at the peak of his powers . Other movies on the matter of legends of Arthur are the following : MGM's first wide-screen film titled &uml;Knights of the Round Table&uml; 1953 ( by Richard Thorpe) , the musical &uml;Camelot&uml;(Joshua Logan) , the fantastic &uml;Excalibur&uml;(John Boorman) and recently &uml;King Arthur&uml;(Antoine Fuqua). The picture will appeal to aficionados with chivalric ideals and historic movies fans , it is a fine production that will lose much on small television screen . This spellbinding film is freely inspired on legends and supposedly based on facts and famed personages . In spite of there aren't real documents about legendary feats King Arthur , allegedly in VI century he was King of Bretons and then were created in 12th century some writings by notorious French authors who romanticized the legend as Chretien of Troyes , Thomas Malory that wrote the Breton series with their knights looking for the Holy Grail . Besides Godofredo of Mormouth publicized in 1136 the History Regnum Britanniae and in XX century John Steinbeck wrote about the events of King Arthur . The story concerns when the Romans had withdrawn Britain and the Empire dissolved into chaos,then rules the king Arthur, he achieved to maintain the Christianity and civilization in the west of England ,though no exactly congruent with the VI century , time was presumed to have lived but the film is developed in a high medieval panoply .

    "First Knight" is full of action,romance,adventure and good humour.There is the ultimate good guy - King Arthur - and,in case you're in any doubt,a very nasty bad guy called Lord Malignant or something so close it makes no difference.It has the slightly fading elfin charm of Mr Richard Gere as the nimble swordsman Lancelot,a man who says he doesn't care whether he lives or dies which rather gives him the edge in the swordfights by which he earns a crust,almost literally sometimes. This is a fine physical performance which only loses its edge when he is forced to think rather than do. We know little of Lancelot's history - a bit like Shane - but the inference is that he is the scion of some nobleman;perhaps born on the wrong side of the blanket. Rescuing the Lady Guinevere (Miss Julia Ormond)from the evil Lord Malagant he falls instantly under her spell despite the fact that she is betrothed(for political purposes) to King Arthur. "The next time we meet you will kiss me",he says with a rueful grin. To be fair,Mr Gere spends quite a lot of time ruefully grinning,but he is rather good at it so why not? In Camelot at the celebration for King Arthur's forthcoming nuptials Lancelot does indeed win a kiss from Guinevere by winning some mediaeval form of Supermario to the acclaim of the gathered crowd and that brings him to the attention of the king(Mr Sean Connery). After joining the Round Table,Lancelot becomes a confidant of the King but his conscience is racked(cue for much brow - furrowing from Mr Gere) and the not - quite lovers are caught in an embrace by Arthur. Lord Malagant attacks Camelot,King Arthur is killed,Lancelot in turn kills Malagant and peace is restored to the kingdom.Huzzah!. Miss Julia Ormond is breathtakingly beautiful,Mr Sean Connery is the very epitome of integrity. Along with "The Black Shield of Falworth","First Knight" stands as Hollywood's finest entertaining take on mediaeval England. It sweeps one up from the start and deposits one rather breathlessly in a neverland Olde Worlde which never existed but should have done. No one in either movie actually says "yonder lies the castle of my fodder"but I rather wish they had.

Sean Connery is a great actor, but too old (IMHO) to play Arthur. Gere is horrible as Lancelot. If you want a good movie about King Arthur, get Excalibur.

Guinevere says that she loves him, but he is not convinced, "show me the look you gave him." It is all about love, and he wants the love in the heart, but not in the head. Yet Arthur is a very level headed man. Most men, especially in those days, would have removed Lancelot's head without a second thought. Instead, he arrests Lancelot and puts him on trial in front of the entire land. This is probably was not the best idea because he is bringing a personal matter and exposing it to the people. He is putting Lancelot and Guinevere to shame with such a thing - something that Lancelot does not want. Of course, the threat of Malagant is always present.

    "First Knight" is full of action,romance,adventure and good humour.There is the ultimate good guy - King Arthur - and,in case you're in any doubt,a very nasty bad guy called Lord Malignant or something so close it makes no difference.It has the slightly fading elfin charm of Mr Richard Gere as the nimble swordsman Lancelot,a man who says he doesn't care whether he lives or dies which rather gives him the edge in the swordfights by which he earns a crust,almost literally sometimes. This is a fine physical performance which only loses its edge when he is forced to think rather than do. We know little of Lancelot's history - a bit like Shane - but the inference is that he is the scion of some nobleman;perhaps born on the wrong side of the blanket. Rescuing the Lady Guinevere (Miss Julia Ormond)from the evil Lord Malagant he falls instantly under her spell despite the fact that she is betrothed(for political purposes) to King Arthur. "The next time we meet you will kiss me",he says with a rueful grin. To be fair,Mr Gere spends quite a lot of time ruefully grinning,but he is rather good at it so why not? In Camelot at the celebration for King Arthur's forthcoming nuptials Lancelot does indeed win a kiss from Guinevere by winning some mediaeval form of Supermario to the acclaim of the gathered crowd and that brings him to the attention of the king(Mr Sean Connery). After joining the Round Table,Lancelot becomes a confidant of the King but his conscience is racked(cue for much brow - furrowing from Mr Gere) and the not - quite lovers are caught in an embrace by Arthur. Lord Malagant attacks Camelot,King Arthur is killed,Lancelot in turn kills Malagant and peace is restored to the kingdom.Huzzah!. Miss Julia Ormond is breathtakingly beautiful,Mr Sean Connery is the very epitome of integrity. Along with "The Black Shield of Falworth","First Knight" stands as Hollywood's finest entertaining take on mediaeval England. It sweeps one up from the start and deposits one rather breathlessly in a neverland Olde Worlde which never existed but should have done. No one in either movie actually says "yonder lies the castle of my fodder"but I rather wish they had.

    This movie was one of the best family movies . 10 out of 10 and for all of the complainers (try not to judge a book for its cover). The film is great and it displays values that a man should poses such as:courage love honor dignity faith and a lot more. I know that for all of you if a film does not have a sex scene or something tot laugh it is a bad film. Try to learn something!!! Excellent film to see with your family on a evening . Splendid casting! Great actors (all of them) Superb display of values! On my opinion today s generation should grow watching those kind of films instead of sf or others. Wonder why people turn out as they are today? See how they talk favorite music or movies....and it is enough to see what kind of person they are.

    First Knight is directed by jerry Zucker and co-written by Lorne Cameron, David Hoselton and William Nicholson. It stars Richard Gere, Sean Connery, Julia Ormond and Ben Cross. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Adam Greenberg. Lancelot (Gere) falls in love with Guinevere (Ormond), inconvenient since she is due to be married to King Arthur (Connery). Meanwhile, Malagant (Cross), who has been expelled from the Round Table, plots to seize power from Arthur and the rest of the Knights of the Round Table. This is a different Camelot, this is principally a period piece love triangle involving King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. To prepare for that instead of expecting a dashing all action picture full of magic and mystical malarkey, can only aid the viewing experience. This is mature well written stuff, very well crafted by Zucker and his team, though the production fluctuates in style (the fight scenes are averagely staged but everything looks gorgeous). Cast are mostly fine, where even though Gere looks odd, somehow out of place with the period, he turns in an acceptable performance considering the humanist screenplay to hand. Lack of chemistry between Connery and Ormond is a problem, while Cross barely registers as a villain of note. Goldsmith provides a heart lifting score, impressive given that he was brought in at the last minute when Maurice Jarre jumped ship. All told it's an enjoyable picture that doesn't linger long in the memory once finished. But I was armed with the knowledge of what sort of narrative I was getting. Had I paid to view it at the cinema on release, I'm pretty sure I would have been just a little miffed, especially given that we also had Braveheart and Rob Roy that year, two scorching hot period epics. 6/10

    I love this movie,Richard Gere (Lancelot) was the hero, that won the heart of Julia Ormond (Guinevere).In this movie she was to marry the King.Which she did even though she loved the first knight.When they met he was just a common man that fought for money. That is my mom's take on the epic tale of King Arther and Lancelot. Mine I love this movie as well, it is one of the best renditions . About the legend of Camelot, I have seen it has adventure lust. And forbidden love , between Lancelot and Guinevere! But this tale of the sorted love triangle, has a dark side like all movies. It has a villain Ben Cross (Maligant) a cruel black hearted monster. Whose sole purpose was to dethrone the King and claim Camelot as his own! Until his untimely demise , by the sword of the first knight!

    It never fails. Every Arthurian movie that has ever been reviewed on this site has some version of these "It's not accurate", It's not historic", "So and so Knight was not like that", "It didn't look like Arthur", "It didn't look like Lancelot", "It didn't look like Guinevere", etc. etc. This is when I get very worried about the would that is full of these people! This is the last time I am doing this because they clearly outnumber me. THERE IS NOTHING TO BE ACCURATE, FAITHFUL OR TRUTHFUL TO! They complain it is not faithful to FICTION. This is legend that was oral legend long before every being written down by anyone and it's been written down thousands of ways! I don't see these movies saying they are the movie of The Once and Future King. No, they are just one more telling of a what? A LEGEND! And, they even believe that this is a IMPORTANT THING! Get a life. Go outside some time. There is a REAL WORLD with REAL IMPORTANT PROBLEMS and CHALLENGES out there. Try worrying about them instead of raging that Richard Gear did not LOOK like LANCELOT (because I have a polaroid of the real one and he looks just like Gear ;). I mean, just how lame can you get (obviously an infinite amount.) I give this movie a 10 just to balance it out. Besides, I think it's a fun film! And as it's impossible for it to be historicity accurate, I don't have to worry about such foolishness.

    Better than doing nothing I suppose. If you have popcorn to go with it. The only resemblance to Arthurian legend are the names and a little of the plot. Probably would have been better if they just made up a mythological kingdom and characters. This is a terrible attempt to tell the story of Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere. Evidently all the money invested in this went to the actor's salaries. The Costumes look like they came from GoodWill Industries and the armour looks like it was made of recycled aluminum cans. Sean Connery is a great actor, but too old (IMHO) to play Arthur. Gere is horrible as Lancelot. If you want a good movie about King Arthur, get Excalibur.

    I was not terribly impressed with First Knight. It tells the eternal triangle story between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot, and shoehorns in a couple of battle set pieces as part of a subplot concerning baddie Prince Malagant seemingly just for the sake of it. The film seems conceived as a vehicle for Richard Gere, although he seems singularly ill at ease throughout it and, for my money, Julia Ormond walks away with the movie. Even Sean Connery gives the impression of phoning it in. Ben Cross' Malagant is perilously close to pantomime villainy. The production values look high but not terribly convincing and the battle sequences are, frankly, poor - lots of clacking together of swords (a la 1950s swashbucklers) with lots of modern blood, but practically no convincing engagement between participants. I suppose this would pass a couple of hours if there was nothing else on TV and you didn't have a good book.

    Most people who saw this movie said that it was bad, and I expected it to be as well, but I decided to watch it anyway. The thing that sort of put me off the movie is that it was about the affair that Lancelot has with Guinevere, and that is something that I never really appreciated. I was expecting there to be a justified affair, which it is not, but this movie did turn out quite differently. In fact I ended up enjoying it. The first thing that I must say is that the cinematography and the sets were quite good. They created an impression of a real place of legend. The realm of Camelot came across as a legendary place which has been lost in the midsts of time. Unfortunately the screenwriters adapted the background of the story a lot - though the main push was that of the love triangle between Lancelot, Arthur, and Guinevere. The changes were immense. In the original story (not that I have read it, but I am going by the movie Excalibur and the mini-series Merlin) Guinevere was a lady that Arthur met at a party and asked Merlin to set them up. In fact Merlin did not even appear in this film, but then it was not his film. Even so, Merlin is an important character as he is Arthur's adviser. In this film, Guinevere was a lady in a realm bordering hostile territory and she was going to marry Arthur for love and political protection. The enemy was Prince Malagant, who was once Arthur's First Knight. He rebelled and is now wanting to destroy Arthur. Malagant is a constant threat, but the thrust is the love between Lancelot and Guinevere. They first meet when Lancelot saves her from Malagant's thugs, and then leads her back to the road. His character is of a roaming knight who charms ladies and does good for no reason, except that he wants to protect the weak. This is because in his past he watched his family be slaughtered in a burning church, and he now seeks to prevent that from happening to others. After they rescue Guinevere's province a boy approaches Lancelot and asks if he can go home. This is a direct reflection of Lancelot's pain as he no longer has a home to go to. His greatest struggle is the love he has for Guinevere, and his service to Arthur. He never wanted to join Arthur because he knew that he would betray him, but Arthur insisted that he do it. He is never far away though because he knows that Malagant wants to force Arthur into an uncompromising situation. But Malagant is only a supporting character, the real struggles comes in the conversations between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot. These occur where the characters struggle to understand their emotions and how they feel for each other. Arthur is not too sure, he has never married and is not interested in marriage, unless the right woman comes along, and he wants this woman to be Guinevere. Yet he is not sure, and while talking with her, he is trying to convince himself that this is the right choice to make. He is afraid of being hurt, and unfortunately this is what happens. He wants love and when he catches Lancelot and Guinevere kissing, he realises that this is not what he has. Guinevere says that she loves him, but he is not convinced, "show me the look you gave him." It is all about love, and he wants the love in the heart, but not in the head. Yet Arthur is a very level headed man. Most men, especially in those days, would have removed Lancelot's head without a second thought. Instead, he arrests Lancelot and puts him on trial in front of the entire land. This is probably was not the best idea because he is bringing a personal matter and exposing it to the people. He is putting Lancelot and Guinevere to shame with such a thing - something that Lancelot does not want. Of course, the threat of Malagant is always present.

    I love this movie,Richard Gere (Lancelot) was the hero, that won the heart of Julia Ormond (Guinevere).In this movie she was to marry the King.Which she did even though she loved the first knight.When they met he was just a common man that fought for money. That is my mom's take on the epic tale of King Arther and Lancelot. Mine I love this movie as well, it is one of the best renditions . About the legend of Camelot, I have seen it has adventure lust. And forbidden love , between Lancelot and Guinevere! But this tale of the sorted love triangle, has a dark side like all movies. It has a villain Ben Cross (Maligant) a cruel black hearted monster. Whose sole purpose was to dethrone the King and claim Camelot as his own! Until his untimely demise , by the sword of the first knight!

    It never fails. Every Arthurian movie that has ever been reviewed on this site has some version of these "It's not accurate", It's not historic", "So and so Knight was not like that", "It didn't look like Arthur", "It didn't look like Lancelot", "It didn't look like Guinevere", etc. etc. This is when I get very worried about the would that is full of these people! This is the last time I am doing this because they clearly outnumber me. THERE IS NOTHING TO BE ACCURATE, FAITHFUL OR TRUTHFUL TO! They complain it is not faithful to FICTION. This is legend that was oral legend long before every being written down by anyone and it's been written down thousands of ways! I don't see these movies saying they are the movie of The Once and Future King. No, they are just one more telling of a what? A LEGEND! And, they even believe that this is a IMPORTANT THING! Get a life. Go outside some time. There is a REAL WORLD with REAL IMPORTANT PROBLEMS and CHALLENGES out there. Try worrying about them instead of raging that Richard Gear did not LOOK like LANCELOT (because I have a polaroid of the real one and he looks just like Gear ;). I mean, just how lame can you get (obviously an infinite amount.) I give this movie a 10 just to balance it out. Besides, I think it's a fun film! And as it's impossible for it to be historicity accurate, I don't have to worry about such foolishness.

    Better than doing nothing I suppose. If you have popcorn to go with it. The only resemblance to Arthurian legend are the names and a little of the plot. Probably would have been better if they just made up a mythological kingdom and characters. This is a terrible attempt to tell the story of Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere. Evidently all the money invested in this went to the actor's salaries. The Costumes look like they came from GoodWill Industries and the armour looks like it was made of recycled aluminum cans. Sean Connery is a great actor, but too old (IMHO) to play Arthur. Gere is horrible as Lancelot. If you want a good movie about King Arthur, get Excalibur.

    I was not terribly impressed with First Knight. It tells the eternal triangle story between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot, and shoehorns in a couple of battle set pieces as part of a subplot concerning baddie Prince Malagant seemingly just for the sake of it. The film seems conceived as a vehicle for Richard Gere, although he seems singularly ill at ease throughout it and, for my money, Julia Ormond walks away with the movie. Even Sean Connery gives the impression of phoning it in. Ben Cross' Malagant is perilously close to pantomime villainy. The production values look high but not terribly convincing and the battle sequences are, frankly, poor - lots of clacking together of swords (a la 1950s swashbucklers) with lots of modern blood, but practically no convincing engagement between participants. I suppose this would pass a couple of hours if there was nothing else on TV and you didn't have a good book.

    Most people who saw this movie said that it was bad, and I expected it to be as well, but I decided to watch it anyway. The thing that sort of put me off the movie is that it was about the affair that Lancelot has with Guinevere, and that is something that I never really appreciated. I was expecting there to be a justified affair, which it is not, but this movie did turn out quite differently. In fact I ended up enjoying it. The first thing that I must say is that the cinematography and the sets were quite good. They created an impression of a real place of legend. The realm of Camelot came across as a legendary place which has been lost in the midsts of time. Unfortunately the screenwriters adapted the background of the story a lot - though the main push was that of the love triangle between Lancelot, Arthur, and Guinevere. The changes were immense. In the original story (not that I have read it, but I am going by the movie Excalibur and the mini-series Merlin) Guinevere was a lady that Arthur met at a party and asked Merlin to set them up. In fact Merlin did not even appear in this film, but then it was not his film. Even so, Merlin is an important character as he is Arthur's adviser. In this film, Guinevere was a lady in a realm bordering hostile territory and she was going to marry Arthur for love and political protection. The enemy was Prince Malagant, who was once Arthur's First Knight. He rebelled and is now wanting to destroy Arthur. Malagant is a constant threat, but the thrust is the love between Lancelot and Guinevere. They first meet when Lancelot saves her from Malagant's thugs, and then leads her back to the road. His character is of a roaming knight who charms ladies and does good for no reason, except that he wants to protect the weak. This is because in his past he watched his family be slaughtered in a burning church, and he now seeks to prevent that from happening to others. After they rescue Guinevere's province a boy approaches Lancelot and asks if he can go home. This is a direct reflection of Lancelot's pain as he no longer has a home to go to. His greatest struggle is the love he has for Guinevere, and his service to Arthur. He never wanted to join Arthur because he knew that he would betray him, but Arthur insisted that he do it. He is never far away though because he knows that Malagant wants to force Arthur into an uncompromising situation. But Malagant is only a supporting character, the real struggles comes in the conversations between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot. These occur where the characters struggle to understand their emotions and how they feel for each other. Arthur is not too sure, he has never married and is not interested in marriage, unless the right woman comes along, and he wants this woman to be Guinevere. Yet he is not sure, and while talking with her, he is trying to convince himself that this is the right choice to make. He is afraid of being hurt, and unfortunately this is what happens. He wants love and when he catches Lancelot and Guinevere kissing, he realises that this is not what he has. Guinevere says that she loves him, but he is not convinced, "show me the look you gave him." It is all about love, and he wants the love in the heart, but not in the head. Yet Arthur is a very level headed man. Most men, especially in those days, would have removed Lancelot's head without a second thought. Instead, he arrests Lancelot and puts him on trial in front of the entire land. This is probably was not the best idea because he is bringing a personal matter and exposing it to the people. He is putting Lancelot and Guinevere to shame with such a thing - something that Lancelot does not want. Of course, the threat of Malagant is always present.

Meanwhile, a violent warlord attempts to seize power from Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table , as they set out in fight against the traitor Prince Malagant (Ben Cross), a Sir Mordred-alike . Whilst in the meantime the bride Guinevere and Sir Lancelot betray the king in their own way . Adding the apparition of knights of the round table as Sir Kay (Christopher Villiers) , Agravaine (Liam Cunningham) , Sir Patrise (Valentine Pelka) and Sir Mador (McCormack) , though there doesn't turns up neither Merlin , nor Morgana LeFay and all things supernatural are out of this flick . This is an overwhelming tale with adventures, villainy,romance and heroism in the grandeur of big screen although in television set is lost its splendor . This sweeping movie displays adventures , thrills , a romantic love story , breathtaking battles and epic confrontation with a terrific climax final for a mortal confrontation . Excellent main cast as an attractive Richard Gere , a gorgeous Julia Ormond , and exceptional , as always , Sean Connery as Arthur , an aged and war-weary king who is forced to go to battle one last time . Rousing battle scenes with impressive production design by John Box , though is also used computer generator . Excellent settings , the castles ,outdoors and tournaments or jousts are well staged .

The picture will appeal to aficionados with chivalric ideals and historic movies fans , it is a fine production that will lose much on small television screen . This spellbinding film is freely inspired on legends and supposedly based on facts and famed personages . In spite of there aren't real documents about legendary feats King Arthur , allegedly in VI century he was King of Bretons and then were created in 12th century some writings by notorious French authors who romanticized the legend as Chretien of Troyes , Thomas Malory that wrote the Breton series with their knights looking for the Holy Grail . Besides Godofredo of Mormouth publicized in 1136 the History Regnum Britanniae and in XX century John Steinbeck wrote about the events of King Arthur . The story concerns when the Romans had withdrawn Britain and the Empire dissolved into chaos,then rules the king Arthur, he achieved to maintain the Christianity and civilization in the west of England ,though no exactly congruent with the VI century , time was presumed to have lived but the film is developed in a high medieval panoply .

    "First Knight" is full of action,romance,adventure and good humour.There is the ultimate good guy - King Arthur - and,in case you're in any doubt,a very nasty bad guy called Lord Malignant or something so close it makes no difference.It has the slightly fading elfin charm of Mr Richard Gere as the nimble swordsman Lancelot,a man who says he doesn't care whether he lives or dies which rather gives him the edge in the swordfights by which he earns a crust,almost literally sometimes. This is a fine physical performance which only loses its edge when he is forced to think rather than do. We know little of Lancelot's history - a bit like Shane - but the inference is that he is the scion of some nobleman;perhaps born on the wrong side of the blanket. Rescuing the Lady Guinevere (Miss Julia Ormond)from the evil Lord Malagant he falls instantly under her spell despite the fact that she is betrothed(for political purposes) to King Arthur. "The next time we meet you will kiss me",he says with a rueful grin. To be fair,Mr Gere spends quite a lot of time ruefully grinning,but he is rather good at it so why not? In Camelot at the celebration for King Arthur's forthcoming nuptials Lancelot does indeed win a kiss from Guinevere by winning some mediaeval form of Supermario to the acclaim of the gathered crowd and that brings him to the attention of the king(Mr Sean Connery). After joining the Round Table,Lancelot becomes a confidant of the King but his conscience is racked(cue for much brow - furrowing from Mr Gere) and the not - quite lovers are caught in an embrace by Arthur. Lord Malagant attacks Camelot,King Arthur is killed,Lancelot in turn kills Malagant and peace is restored to the kingdom.Huzzah!. Miss Julia Ormond is breathtakingly beautiful,Mr Sean Connery is the very epitome of integrity. Along with "The Black Shield of Falworth","First Knight" stands as Hollywood's finest entertaining take on mediaeval England. It sweeps one up from the start and deposits one rather breathlessly in a neverland Olde Worlde which never existed but should have done. No one in either movie actually says "yonder lies the castle of my fodder"but I rather wish they had.

    This movie was one of the best family movies . 10 out of 10 and for all of the complainers (try not to judge a book for its cover). The film is great and it displays values that a man should poses such as:courage love honor dignity faith and a lot more. I know that for all of you if a film does not have a sex scene or something tot laugh it is a bad film. Try to learn something!!! Excellent film to see with your family on a evening . Splendid casting! Great actors (all of them) Superb display of values! On my opinion today s generation should grow watching those kind of films instead of sf or others. Wonder why people turn out as they are today? See how they talk favorite music or movies....and it is enough to see what kind of person they are.

    First Knight is directed by jerry Zucker and co-written by Lorne Cameron, David Hoselton and William Nicholson. It stars Richard Gere, Sean Connery, Julia Ormond and Ben Cross. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Adam Greenberg. Lancelot (Gere) falls in love with Guinevere (Ormond), inconvenient since she is due to be married to King Arthur (Connery). Meanwhile, Malagant (Cross), who has been expelled from the Round Table, plots to seize power from Arthur and the rest of the Knights of the Round Table. This is a different Camelot, this is principally a period piece love triangle involving King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. To prepare for that instead of expecting a dashing all action picture full of magic and mystical malarkey, can only aid the viewing experience. This is mature well written stuff, very well crafted by Zucker and his team, though the production fluctuates in style (the fight scenes are averagely staged but everything looks gorgeous). Cast are mostly fine, where even though Gere looks odd, somehow out of place with the period, he turns in an acceptable performance considering the humanist screenplay to hand. Lack of chemistry between Connery and Ormond is a problem, while Cross barely registers as a villain of note. Goldsmith provides a heart lifting score, impressive given that he was brought in at the last minute when Maurice Jarre jumped ship. All told it's an enjoyable picture that doesn't linger long in the memory once finished. But I was armed with the knowledge of what sort of narrative I was getting. Had I paid to view it at the cinema on release, I'm pretty sure I would have been just a little miffed, especially given that we also had Braveheart and Rob Roy that year, two scorching hot period epics. 6/10

    I love this movie,Richard Gere (Lancelot) was the hero, that won the heart of Julia Ormond (Guinevere).In this movie she was to marry the King.Which she did even though she loved the first knight.When they met he was just a common man that fought for money. That is my mom's take on the epic tale of King Arther and Lancelot. Mine I love this movie as well, it is one of the best renditions . About the legend of Camelot, I have seen it has adventure lust. And forbidden love , between Lancelot and Guinevere! But this tale of the sorted love triangle, has a dark side like all movies. It has a villain Ben Cross (Maligant) a cruel black hearted monster. Whose sole purpose was to dethrone the King and claim Camelot as his own! Until his untimely demise , by the sword of the first knight!

Evidently all the money invested in this went to the actor's salaries. The Costumes look like they came from GoodWill Industries and the armour looks like it was made of recycled aluminum cans. Sean Connery is a great actor, but too old (IMHO) to play Arthur. Gere is horrible as Lancelot. If you want a good movie about King Arthur, get Excalibur.

    "First Knight" is full of action,romance,adventure and good humour.There is the ultimate good guy - King Arthur - and,in case you're in any doubt,a very nasty bad guy called Lord Malignant or something so close it makes no difference.It has the slightly fading elfin charm of Mr Richard Gere as the nimble swordsman Lancelot,a man who says he doesn't care whether he lives or dies which rather gives him the edge in the swordfights by which he earns a crust,almost literally sometimes. This is a fine physical performance which only loses its edge when he is forced to think rather than do. We know little of Lancelot's history - a bit like Shane - but the inference is that he is the scion of some nobleman;perhaps born on the wrong side of the blanket. Rescuing the Lady Guinevere (Miss Julia Ormond)from the evil Lord Malagant he falls instantly under her spell despite the fact that she is betrothed(for political purposes) to King Arthur. "The next time we meet you will kiss me",he says with a rueful grin. To be fair,Mr Gere spends quite a lot of time ruefully grinning,but he is rather good at it so why not? In Camelot at the celebration for King Arthur's forthcoming nuptials Lancelot does indeed win a kiss from Guinevere by winning some mediaeval form of Supermario to the acclaim of the gathered crowd and that brings him to the attention of the king(Mr Sean Connery). After joining the Round Table,Lancelot becomes a confidant of the King but his conscience is racked(cue for much brow - furrowing from Mr Gere) and the not - quite lovers are caught in an embrace by Arthur. Lord Malagant attacks Camelot,King Arthur is killed,Lancelot in turn kills Malagant and peace is restored to the kingdom.Huzzah!. Miss Julia Ormond is breathtakingly beautiful,Mr Sean Connery is the very epitome of integrity. Along with "The Black Shield of Falworth","First Knight" stands as Hollywood's finest entertaining take on mediaeval England. It sweeps one up from the start and deposits one rather breathlessly in a neverland Olde Worlde which never existed but should have done. No one in either movie actually says "yonder lies the castle of my fodder"but I rather wish they had.

    This movie was one of the best family movies . 10 out of 10 and for all of the complainers (try not to judge a book for its cover). The film is great and it displays values that a man should poses such as:courage love honor dignity faith and a lot more. I know that for all of you if a film does not have a sex scene or something tot laugh it is a bad film. Try to learn something!!! Excellent film to see with your family on a evening . Splendid casting! Great actors (all of them) Superb display of values! On my opinion today s generation should grow watching those kind of films instead of sf or others. Wonder why people turn out as they are today? See how they talk favorite music or movies....and it is enough to see what kind of person they are.

    First Knight is directed by jerry Zucker and co-written by Lorne Cameron, David Hoselton and William Nicholson. It stars Richard Gere, Sean Connery, Julia Ormond and Ben Cross. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Adam Greenberg. Lancelot (Gere) falls in love with Guinevere (Ormond), inconvenient since she is due to be married to King Arthur (Connery). Meanwhile, Malagant (Cross), who has been expelled from the Round Table, plots to seize power from Arthur and the rest of the Knights of the Round Table. This is a different Camelot, this is principally a period piece love triangle involving King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. To prepare for that instead of expecting a dashing all action picture full of magic and mystical malarkey, can only aid the viewing experience. This is mature well written stuff, very well crafted by Zucker and his team, though the production fluctuates in style (the fight scenes are averagely staged but everything looks gorgeous). Cast are mostly fine, where even though Gere looks odd, somehow out of place with the period, he turns in an acceptable performance considering the humanist screenplay to hand. Lack of chemistry between Connery and Ormond is a problem, while Cross barely registers as a villain of note. Goldsmith provides a heart lifting score, impressive given that he was brought in at the last minute when Maurice Jarre jumped ship. All told it's an enjoyable picture that doesn't linger long in the memory once finished. But I was armed with the knowledge of what sort of narrative I was getting. Had I paid to view it at the cinema on release, I'm pretty sure I would have been just a little miffed, especially given that we also had Braveheart and Rob Roy that year, two scorching hot period epics. 6/10

    I love this movie,Richard Gere (Lancelot) was the hero, that won the heart of Julia Ormond (Guinevere).In this movie she was to marry the King.Which she did even though she loved the first knight.When they met he was just a common man that fought for money. That is my mom's take on the epic tale of King Arther and Lancelot. Mine I love this movie as well, it is one of the best renditions . About the legend of Camelot, I have seen it has adventure lust. And forbidden love , between Lancelot and Guinevere! But this tale of the sorted love triangle, has a dark side like all movies. It has a villain Ben Cross (Maligant) a cruel black hearted monster. Whose sole purpose was to dethrone the King and claim Camelot as his own! Until his untimely demise , by the sword of the first knight!

    It never fails. Every Arthurian movie that has ever been reviewed on this site has some version of these "It's not accurate", It's not historic", "So and so Knight was not like that", "It didn't look like Arthur", "It didn't look like Lancelot", "It didn't look like Guinevere", etc. etc. This is when I get very worried about the would that is full of these people! This is the last time I am doing this because they clearly outnumber me. THERE IS NOTHING TO BE ACCURATE, FAITHFUL OR TRUTHFUL TO! They complain it is not faithful to FICTION. This is legend that was oral legend long before every being written down by anyone and it's been written down thousands of ways! I don't see these movies saying they are the movie of The Once and Future King. No, they are just one more telling of a what? A LEGEND! And, they even believe that this is a IMPORTANT THING! Get a life. Go outside some time. There is a REAL WORLD with REAL IMPORTANT PROBLEMS and CHALLENGES out there. Try worrying about them instead of raging that Richard Gear did not LOOK like LANCELOT (because I have a polaroid of the real one and he looks just like Gear ;). I mean, just how lame can you get (obviously an infinite amount.) I give this movie a 10 just to balance it out. Besides, I think it's a fun film! And as it's impossible for it to be historicity accurate, I don't have to worry about such foolishness.

    Better than doing nothing I suppose. If you have popcorn to go with it. The only resemblance to Arthurian legend are the names and a little of the plot. Probably would have been better if they just made up a mythological kingdom and characters. This is a terrible attempt to tell the story of Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere. Evidently all the money invested in this went to the actor's salaries. The Costumes look like they came from GoodWill Industries and the armour looks like it was made of recycled aluminum cans. Sean Connery is a great actor, but too old (IMHO) to play Arthur. Gere is horrible as Lancelot. If you want a good movie about King Arthur, get Excalibur.

    I was not terribly impressed with First Knight. It tells the eternal triangle story between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot, and shoehorns in a couple of battle set pieces as part of a subplot concerning baddie Prince Malagant seemingly just for the sake of it. The film seems conceived as a vehicle for Richard Gere, although he seems singularly ill at ease throughout it and, for my money, Julia Ormond walks away with the movie. Even Sean Connery gives the impression of phoning it in. Ben Cross' Malagant is perilously close to pantomime villainy. The production values look high but not terribly convincing and the battle sequences are, frankly, poor - lots of clacking together of swords (a la 1950s swashbucklers) with lots of modern blood, but practically no convincing engagement between participants. I suppose this would pass a couple of hours if there was nothing else on TV and you didn't have a good book.

    Most people who saw this movie said that it was bad, and I expected it to be as well, but I decided to watch it anyway. The thing that sort of put me off the movie is that it was about the affair that Lancelot has with Guinevere, and that is something that I never really appreciated. I was expecting there to be a justified affair, which it is not, but this movie did turn out quite differently. In fact I ended up enjoying it. The first thing that I must say is that the cinematography and the sets were quite good. They created an impression of a real place of legend. The realm of Camelot came across as a legendary place which has been lost in the midsts of time. Unfortunately the screenwriters adapted the background of the story a lot - though the main push was that of the love triangle between Lancelot, Arthur, and Guinevere. The changes were immense. In the original story (not that I have read it, but I am going by the movie Excalibur and the mini-series Merlin) Guinevere was a lady that Arthur met at a party and asked Merlin to set them up. In fact Merlin did not even appear in this film, but then it was not his film. Even so, Merlin is an important character as he is Arthur's adviser. In this film, Guinevere was a lady in a realm bordering hostile territory and she was going to marry Arthur for love and political protection. The enemy was Prince Malagant, who was once Arthur's First Knight. He rebelled and is now wanting to destroy Arthur. Malagant is a constant threat, but the thrust is the love between Lancelot and Guinevere. They first meet when Lancelot saves her from Malagant's thugs, and then leads her back to the road. His character is of a roaming knight who charms ladies and does good for no reason, except that he wants to protect the weak. This is because in his past he watched his family be slaughtered in a burning church, and he now seeks to prevent that from happening to others. After they rescue Guinevere's province a boy approaches Lancelot and asks if he can go home. This is a direct reflection of Lancelot's pain as he no longer has a home to go to. His greatest struggle is the love he has for Guinevere, and his service to Arthur. He never wanted to join Arthur because he knew that he would betray him, but Arthur insisted that he do it. He is never far away though because he knows that Malagant wants to force Arthur into an uncompromising situation. But Malagant is only a supporting character, the real struggles comes in the conversations between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot. These occur where the characters struggle to understand their emotions and how they feel for each other. Arthur is not too sure, he has never married and is not interested in marriage, unless the right woman comes along, and he wants this woman to be Guinevere. Yet he is not sure, and while talking with her, he is trying to convince himself that this is the right choice to make. He is afraid of being hurt, and unfortunately this is what happens. He wants love and when he catches Lancelot and Guinevere kissing, he realises that this is not what he has. Guinevere says that she loves him, but he is not convinced, "show me the look you gave him." It is all about love, and he wants the love in the heart, but not in the head. Yet Arthur is a very level headed man. Most men, especially in those days, would have removed Lancelot's head without a second thought. Instead, he arrests Lancelot and puts him on trial in front of the entire land. This is probably was not the best idea because he is bringing a personal matter and exposing it to the people. He is putting Lancelot and Guinevere to shame with such a thing - something that Lancelot does not want. Of course, the threat of Malagant is always present.

    Mighty and pretty spectacle about Lancelot , King Arthur , Guinevere and the famous romance in color magnificence . This spectacular production from Jerry Zucker that gave you &uml;Ghost and Airplane&uml; among others and only Columbia TriStar could bring it so magnificently to the screen including a majestic soundtrack and splendid cinematography . The classic story of romantic adventure come to life enriched in glamorous color and with such great stars as Richard Gere (roving spirit Lancelot), Julia Ormond (wonderful Guinevere), and of course the great Sean Connery (upright Arthur) in the classic love triangle . Restless Lancelot who lives by his wits falls in love with Guinevere, who is due to be married to King Arthur . Meanwhile, a violent warlord attempts to seize power from Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table , as they set out in fight against the traitor Prince Malagant (Ben Cross), a Sir Mordred-alike . Whilst in the meantime the bride Guinevere and Sir Lancelot betray the king in their own way . Adding the apparition of knights of the round table as Sir Kay (Christopher Villiers) , Agravaine (Liam Cunningham) , Sir Patrise (Valentine Pelka) and Sir Mador (McCormack) , though there doesn't turns up neither Merlin , nor Morgana LeFay and all things supernatural are out of this flick . This is an overwhelming tale with adventures, villainy,romance and heroism in the grandeur of big screen although in television set is lost its splendor . This sweeping movie displays adventures , thrills , a romantic love story , breathtaking battles and epic confrontation with a terrific climax final for a mortal confrontation . Excellent main cast as an attractive Richard Gere , a gorgeous Julia Ormond , and exceptional , as always , Sean Connery as Arthur , an aged and war-weary king who is forced to go to battle one last time . Rousing battle scenes with impressive production design by John Box , though is also used computer generator . Excellent settings , the castles ,outdoors and tournaments or jousts are well staged . Handsome story well written by William Nicholson though contains some awkward narrative elements . Luscious costumes and gowns specially suited for Julia Ormond . Colorful wide-screen cinematography by stylish cameraman Adam Greenberg . Emotive and sensational musical score by the classic Jerry Goldsmith . However this epic film never takes off as it should despite of pomp and circumstance showed . The motion picture is imaginatively directed by Jerry Zucker working at the peak of his powers . Other movies on the matter of legends of Arthur are the following : MGM's first wide-screen film titled &uml;Knights of the Round Table&uml; 1953 ( by Richard Thorpe) , the musical &uml;Camelot&uml;(Joshua Logan) , the fantastic &uml;Excalibur&uml;(John Boorman) and recently &uml;King Arthur&uml;(Antoine Fuqua). The picture will appeal to aficionados with chivalric ideals and historic movies fans , it is a fine production that will lose much on small television screen . This spellbinding film is freely inspired on legends and supposedly based on facts and famed personages . In spite of there aren't real documents about legendary feats King Arthur , allegedly in VI century he was King of Bretons and then were created in 12th century some writings by notorious French authors who romanticized the legend as Chretien of Troyes , Thomas Malory that wrote the Breton series with their knights looking for the Holy Grail . Besides Godofredo of Mormouth publicized in 1136 the History Regnum Britanniae and in XX century John Steinbeck wrote about the events of King Arthur . The story concerns when the Romans had withdrawn Britain and the Empire dissolved into chaos,then rules the king Arthur, he achieved to maintain the Christianity and civilization in the west of England ,though no exactly congruent with the VI century , time was presumed to have lived but the film is developed in a high medieval panoply .

The first thing that I must say is that the cinematography and the sets were quite good. They created an impression of a real place of legend. The realm of Camelot came across as a legendary place which has been lost in the midsts of time. Unfortunately the screenwriters adapted the background of the story a lot - though the main push was that of the love triangle between Lancelot, Arthur, and Guinevere. The changes were immense. In the original story (not that I have read it, but I am going by the movie Excalibur and the mini-series Merlin) Guinevere was a lady that Arthur met at a party and asked Merlin to set them up. In fact Merlin did not even appear in this film, but then it was not his film. Even so, Merlin is an important character as he is Arthur's adviser. In this film, Guinevere was a lady in a realm bordering hostile territory and she was going to marry Arthur for love and political protection. The enemy was Prince Malagant, who was once Arthur's First Knight. He rebelled and is now wanting to destroy Arthur. Malagant is a constant threat, but the thrust is the love between Lancelot and Guinevere. They first meet when Lancelot saves her from Malagant's thugs, and then leads her back to the road. His character is of a roaming knight who charms ladies and does good for no reason, except that he wants to protect the weak. This is because in his past he watched his family be slaughtered in a burning church, and he now seeks to prevent that from happening to others. After they rescue Guinevere's province a boy approaches Lancelot and asks if he can go home. This is a direct reflection of Lancelot's pain as he no longer has a home to go to. His greatest struggle is the love he has for Guinevere, and his service to Arthur. He never wanted to join Arthur because he knew that he would betray him, but Arthur insisted that he do it. He is never far away though because he knows that Malagant wants to force Arthur into an uncompromising situation. But Malagant is only a supporting character, the real struggles comes in the conversations between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot. These occur where the characters struggle to understand their emotions and how they feel for each other. Arthur is not too sure, he has never married and is not interested in marriage, unless the right woman comes along, and he wants this woman to be Guinevere. Yet he is not sure, and while talking with her, he is trying to convince himself that this is the right choice to make. He is afraid of being hurt, and unfortunately this is what happens. He wants love and when he catches Lancelot and Guinevere kissing, he realises that this is not what he has. Guinevere says that she loves him, but he is not convinced, "show me the look you gave him." It is all about love, and he wants the love in the heart, but not in the head. Yet Arthur is a very level headed man. Most men, especially in those days, would have removed Lancelot's head without a second thought. Instead, he arrests Lancelot and puts him on trial in front of the entire land. This is probably was not the best idea because he is bringing a personal matter and exposing it to the people. He is putting Lancelot and Guinevere to shame with such a thing - something that Lancelot does not want. Of course, the threat of Malagant is always present.

    Mighty and pretty spectacle about Lancelot , King Arthur , Guinevere and the famous romance in color magnificence . This spectacular production from Jerry Zucker that gave you &uml;Ghost and Airplane&uml; among others and only Columbia TriStar could bring it so magnificently to the screen including a majestic soundtrack and splendid cinematography . The classic story of romantic adventure come to life enriched in glamorous color and with such great stars as Richard Gere (roving spirit Lancelot), Julia Ormond (wonderful Guinevere), and of course the great Sean Connery (upright Arthur) in the classic love triangle . Restless Lancelot who lives by his wits falls in love with Guinevere, who is due to be married to King Arthur . Meanwhile, a violent warlord attempts to seize power from Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table , as they set out in fight against the traitor Prince Malagant (Ben Cross), a Sir Mordred-alike . Whilst in the meantime the bride Guinevere and Sir Lancelot betray the king in their own way . Adding the apparition of knights of the round table as Sir Kay (Christopher Villiers) , Agravaine (Liam Cunningham) , Sir Patrise (Valentine Pelka) and Sir Mador (McCormack) , though there doesn't turns up neither Merlin , nor Morgana LeFay and all things supernatural are out of this flick . This is an overwhelming tale with adventures, villainy,romance and heroism in the grandeur of big screen although in television set is lost its splendor . This sweeping movie displays adventures , thrills , a romantic love story , breathtaking battles and epic confrontation with a terrific climax final for a mortal confrontation . Excellent main cast as an attractive Richard Gere , a gorgeous Julia Ormond , and exceptional , as always , Sean Connery as Arthur , an aged and war-weary king who is forced to go to battle one last time . Rousing battle scenes with impressive production design by John Box , though is also used computer generator . Excellent settings , the castles ,outdoors and tournaments or jousts are well staged . Handsome story well written by William Nicholson though contains some awkward narrative elements . Luscious costumes and gowns specially suited for Julia Ormond . Colorful wide-screen cinematography by stylish cameraman Adam Greenberg . Emotive and sensational musical score by the classic Jerry Goldsmith . However this epic film never takes off as it should despite of pomp and circumstance showed . The motion picture is imaginatively directed by Jerry Zucker working at the peak of his powers . Other movies on the matter of legends of Arthur are the following : MGM's first wide-screen film titled &uml;Knights of the Round Table&uml; 1953 ( by Richard Thorpe) , the musical &uml;Camelot&uml;(Joshua Logan) , the fantastic &uml;Excalibur&uml;(John Boorman) and recently &uml;King Arthur&uml;(Antoine Fuqua). The picture will appeal to aficionados with chivalric ideals and historic movies fans , it is a fine production that will lose much on small television screen . This spellbinding film is freely inspired on legends and supposedly based on facts and famed personages . In spite of there aren't real documents about legendary feats King Arthur , allegedly in VI century he was King of Bretons and then were created in 12th century some writings by notorious French authors who romanticized the legend as Chretien of Troyes , Thomas Malory that wrote the Breton series with their knights looking for the Holy Grail . Besides Godofredo of Mormouth publicized in 1136 the History Regnum Britanniae and in XX century John Steinbeck wrote about the events of King Arthur . The story concerns when the Romans had withdrawn Britain and the Empire dissolved into chaos,then rules the king Arthur, he achieved to maintain the Christianity and civilization in the west of England ,though no exactly congruent with the VI century , time was presumed to have lived but the film is developed in a high medieval panoply .
