 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  While visiting the Earth at Night, a group of alien botanists is discovered and disturbed by an approaching human task force. Because of the more than hasty take-off, one of the visitors is left behind. The little alien finds himself all alone on a very strange planet. Fortunately, the extra-terrestrial soon finds a friend and emotional companion in 10-year-old Elliot, who discovered him looking for food in his family's garden shed. While E.T. slowly gets acquainted with Elliot's brother Michael, his sister Gertie as well as with Earth customs, members of the task force work day and night to track down the whereabouts of Earth's first visitor from Outer Space. The wish to go home again is strong in E.T., and after being able to communicate with Elliot and the others, E.T. starts building an improvised device to send a message home for his folks to come and pick him up. But before long, E.T. gets seriously sick, and because of his special connection to Elliot, the young boy suffers, ...

    This is the work which I described the strange friendship of a boy and an alien in and is an undying masterpiece. The good point of this movie is two. The first is the majesty of the back ground music. Impressive music is used simply because it is the work of the genre called SF extending over the space. It gives depth in a view of the world. It is music appropriate for tying the earth and space, a boy and an alien. Particularly, the music of the scene where a bicycle floats in the sky excites me so much. I can be impressed now just to listen to the music. The second is attractiveness of E.T. The process that becomes an important friend while I spend it with an older brother with a younger sister of Eliot and him is splendid. To an alien, they had an image to invade the earth, but this work wipes out the image in those days. In the novelty, I am surprised. If everybody watches this movie, adult will long for childhood, and the child may enjoy it purely. It is a movie wanting any person to watch.

    Aliens come to the earth, however one of them misses the UFO and the alien stays the earth. Elliot finds that, and he named the alien ET. Elliot takes ET his house and he starts to take care of him. I think this movie is very famous and popular. The director is Steven Spielberg. He is so famous director. His many films are wonderful. ET is one of them. I like love movie. The music of this movie is known by many people. I like it. The tone and camera-work are excellent. I like the characters. I love ET. He is an alien and his appearance is not good, however he is so charming. I think almost people who have watched this movie like him. This movie has many famous scenes. In the last scene, I was so moved. I love this movie. It made me feel happy. I recommend you to watch this movie.

    I watched this movie when I was six or seven years old for the first time. I strongly remember that I shed tears at the end of the movie. This is, needles to say, one of the best movie in the world. Science fiction movies always give us dreams but the Spielberg's movies also tell and make us to think of the messages of the story. If you encounter an unknown life, what an earth would you do? This movie has incalculable influence on all over the world. It may be said that almost all of our entertainments are based on the Spielberg's movie---his dream.

    I remember the old times when it was on TV every New Year's Eve. I used to wake up from all that mess and party and just share some moments with my family watching this touching film, leaving everything we should have done after it. This is my favorite movie ever since then... It always remembers me of those old and innocent times. I was really impressed by Eliott's skills, he acted so natural. I guess everyone that watched this film just melted. It is an emotional, sensitive and educative story. It always brings me (I'm sure I'm not the only one) tears in my eyes every time I watch it. It just never gets old... It's suitable for all ages - we all have a heart :)

    It's nice to feel like a kid again now and then. It's a time of innocence and being carefree. Many great films have captured this chapter in our lives. Few have done it the way 'E.T.' does. It's one of those films that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. If you're feeling down, it can lift you back up. Pros: Amazing performances. Beautifully directed. Equally well written. Moving score. Rich cinematography. Great sense of humor. Some really touching moments. Eye-popping effects that have stood the test of time. Flows at a nice pace. Cons: The rainbow at the end is a bit much. Final thoughts: More than 30 years since it's release, 'E.T.' is still one of the most beloved films ever made. It has everything one could want from this kind of film. Many big budget films today lack heart, but it's in abundance here. It's held up and is sweet without being sappy. My rating: 5/5

    I'm not usually very emotional with these kind of emotional family films but this is was an exception. Now when I've grown up and watched in good quality as it could be I was totally shocked. I remembered from the age I was little kid that it was just cool touching and healing and something... Now it was little different experience. For the time being I think this is the most superb movie of 80's and I don't usually like Spielberg very much but this was fantastic. Original and all. Not some Independence Day like nowadays. Alien was really alien and brilliant movie, funny moments and all. Great directing, everything fits just like a glove. Maybe long movie but this one deserves it really. If you are not addicted only to some Transformers and have feelings, humor, sense of irony, childhood memories this is movie I'd never forget. Didn't cry though but ha... well. Great family scifi movie and year 1982 whoa. 12/10 if it could be possible. In its own genre, some might hate this but everyone have their own tastes, genres and all. For scifi freaks must to see if somehow missed, or if watched as a kid and don't remember much at all.

    Steven Spielberg directs this spectacular, involving, and deeply moving film that stars Henry Thomas(superb and totally believable) as Elliot, a young boy who discovers the title creature, and decides to keep it, first from his mother(lovely Dee Wallace) and then the government, who know about the alien, and want it for their own reasons... Story builds its relationships and story points believably and realistically, though perhaps too much in regards to Elliot's siblings and friends, who are at times obnoxious(just like kids would be!) and say inappropriate things, but story is so masterfully told(though admittedly manipulative as well) that it builds to a most satisfying climax, punctuated by John William's soaring score, one of his best. Amazingly,despite this being a monster hit, there was no sequel!

    Friendship is an ageless,timeless subject.The appeal of E.T. and the reason it has never lost appeal is it's unique approach to that subject.We have a space alien.Not the kind that is seeking to control,dominate,or destroy the world,but a tender caring soul.His appearance is somewhat freakish to the first human he encounters,young Elliot,who no doubt is just as freakish in return to the alien.The film then becomes a somewhat comical yet tender "getting to know you" type of story.Also comical are the efforts of young Elliot and his siblings to keep E.T. hid from view from Mom and all others.The film is a timeless treasure easily placed with the Wizard of Oz,among others.

    E.T. is an American science fiction movie. Actually, I rarely watch science fiction movies, but I love this movie. A small boy, Elliott found ET in the forest. Elliott wants to help ET because researchers also want ET to study. He decided to live with ET in his room. Gradually, they reach out to each other. However, on Halloween, something sad happens to them... The reason I love this movie is because of the uniqueness. In this movie, a lot of mysterious things happen one after another, which made me excited! I wish I were Elliot, I thought. He experiences many unbelievable things. For example, he flies riding on a bicycle. If you want to watch science fiction movie, I recommend you this movie.

    E.T. The Extra Terrestrial is an excellent family movie as it deals with friendship, trust, love, and has humor and adventure. When a kid thinks he sees something in his backyard, he goes and checks it out and finds an alien. He takes the alien inside and hides him in his closet as he tries to learn about it. He shows it to his siblings who are stunned by this discovery to and all of them learn from one another as they get E.T. to talk and the four can communicate with one another. Now they must get E.T. home and he needs to get to his ship before he is found out and taken in. E.T. is pretty much a perfect family movie as it shows great love between the children and E.T., friendship for the same reason, trust as they must now trust each other to not tell about E.T. and the adventure part of the film is terrific as there is the chase scene near the end which is so neat when it is fun and exciting and then becomes magical when they fly. E.T. is a movie that is more of a movie to see then explain so I'll cut this short and hope that you see the movie and watch all its superb wonders inside. Grade: A-

It has everything one could want from this kind of film. Many big budget films today lack heart, but it's in abundance here. It's held up and is sweet without being sappy. My rating: 5/5

    I'm not usually very emotional with these kind of emotional family films but this is was an exception. Now when I've grown up and watched in good quality as it could be I was totally shocked. I remembered from the age I was little kid that it was just cool touching and healing and something... Now it was little different experience. For the time being I think this is the most superb movie of 80's and I don't usually like Spielberg very much but this was fantastic. Original and all. Not some Independence Day like nowadays. Alien was really alien and brilliant movie, funny moments and all. Great directing, everything fits just like a glove. Maybe long movie but this one deserves it really. If you are not addicted only to some Transformers and have feelings, humor, sense of irony, childhood memories this is movie I'd never forget. Didn't cry though but ha... well. Great family scifi movie and year 1982 whoa. 12/10 if it could be possible. In its own genre, some might hate this but everyone have their own tastes, genres and all. For scifi freaks must to see if somehow missed, or if watched as a kid and don't remember much at all.

    Steven Spielberg directs this spectacular, involving, and deeply moving film that stars Henry Thomas(superb and totally believable) as Elliot, a young boy who discovers the title creature, and decides to keep it, first from his mother(lovely Dee Wallace) and then the government, who know about the alien, and want it for their own reasons... Story builds its relationships and story points believably and realistically, though perhaps too much in regards to Elliot's siblings and friends, who are at times obnoxious(just like kids would be!) and say inappropriate things, but story is so masterfully told(though admittedly manipulative as well) that it builds to a most satisfying climax, punctuated by John William's soaring score, one of his best. Amazingly,despite this being a monster hit, there was no sequel!

    Friendship is an ageless,timeless subject.The appeal of E.T. and the reason it has never lost appeal is it's unique approach to that subject.We have a space alien.Not the kind that is seeking to control,dominate,or destroy the world,but a tender caring soul.His appearance is somewhat freakish to the first human he encounters,young Elliot,who no doubt is just as freakish in return to the alien.The film then becomes a somewhat comical yet tender "getting to know you" type of story.Also comical are the efforts of young Elliot and his siblings to keep E.T. hid from view from Mom and all others.The film is a timeless treasure easily placed with the Wizard of Oz,among others.

    E.T. is an American science fiction movie. Actually, I rarely watch science fiction movies, but I love this movie. A small boy, Elliott found ET in the forest. Elliott wants to help ET because researchers also want ET to study. He decided to live with ET in his room. Gradually, they reach out to each other. However, on Halloween, something sad happens to them... The reason I love this movie is because of the uniqueness. In this movie, a lot of mysterious things happen one after another, which made me excited! I wish I were Elliot, I thought. He experiences many unbelievable things. For example, he flies riding on a bicycle. If you want to watch science fiction movie, I recommend you this movie.

    E.T. The Extra Terrestrial is an excellent family movie as it deals with friendship, trust, love, and has humor and adventure. When a kid thinks he sees something in his backyard, he goes and checks it out and finds an alien. He takes the alien inside and hides him in his closet as he tries to learn about it. He shows it to his siblings who are stunned by this discovery to and all of them learn from one another as they get E.T. to talk and the four can communicate with one another. Now they must get E.T. home and he needs to get to his ship before he is found out and taken in. E.T. is pretty much a perfect family movie as it shows great love between the children and E.T., friendship for the same reason, trust as they must now trust each other to not tell about E.T. and the adventure part of the film is terrific as there is the chase scene near the end which is so neat when it is fun and exciting and then becomes magical when they fly. E.T. is a movie that is more of a movie to see then explain so I'll cut this short and hope that you see the movie and watch all its superb wonders inside. Grade: A-

    This is the work which I described the strange friendship of a boy and an alien in and is an undying masterpiece. The good point of this movie is two. The first is the majesty of the back ground music. Impressive music is used simply because it is the work of the genre called SF extending over the space. It gives depth in a view of the world. It is music appropriate for tying the earth and space, a boy and an alien. Particularly, the music of the scene where a bicycle floats in the sky excites me so much. I can be impressed now just to listen to the music. The second is attractiveness of E.T. The process that becomes an important friend while I spend it with an older brother with a younger sister of Eliot and him is splendid. To an alien, they had an image to invade the earth, but this work wipes out the image in those days. In the novelty, I am surprised. If everybody watches this movie, adult will long for childhood, and the child may enjoy it purely. It is a movie wanting any person to watch.

    Aliens come to the earth, however one of them misses the UFO and the alien stays the earth. Elliot finds that, and he named the alien ET. Elliot takes ET his house and he starts to take care of him. I think this movie is very famous and popular. The director is Steven Spielberg. He is so famous director. His many films are wonderful. ET is one of them. I like love movie. The music of this movie is known by many people. I like it. The tone and camera-work are excellent. I like the characters. I love ET. He is an alien and his appearance is not good, however he is so charming. I think almost people who have watched this movie like him. This movie has many famous scenes. In the last scene, I was so moved. I love this movie. It made me feel happy. I recommend you to watch this movie.

    I watched this movie when I was six or seven years old for the first time. I strongly remember that I shed tears at the end of the movie. This is, needles to say, one of the best movie in the world. Science fiction movies always give us dreams but the Spielberg's movies also tell and make us to think of the messages of the story. If you encounter an unknown life, what an earth would you do? This movie has incalculable influence on all over the world. It may be said that almost all of our entertainments are based on the Spielberg's movie---his dream.

    I remember the old times when it was on TV every New Year's Eve. I used to wake up from all that mess and party and just share some moments with my family watching this touching film, leaving everything we should have done after it. This is my favorite movie ever since then... It always remembers me of those old and innocent times. I was really impressed by Eliott's skills, he acted so natural. I guess everyone that watched this film just melted. It is an emotional, sensitive and educative story. It always brings me (I'm sure I'm not the only one) tears in my eyes every time I watch it. It just never gets old... It's suitable for all ages - we all have a heart :)

    It's nice to feel like a kid again now and then. It's a time of innocence and being carefree. Many great films have captured this chapter in our lives. Few have done it the way 'E.T.' does. It's one of those films that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. If you're feeling down, it can lift you back up. Pros: Amazing performances. Beautifully directed. Equally well written. Moving score. Rich cinematography. Great sense of humor. Some really touching moments. Eye-popping effects that have stood the test of time. Flows at a nice pace. Cons: The rainbow at the end is a bit much. Final thoughts: More than 30 years since it's release, 'E.T.' is still one of the most beloved films ever made. It has everything one could want from this kind of film. Many big budget films today lack heart, but it's in abundance here. It's held up and is sweet without being sappy. My rating: 5/5

    Aliens come to the earth, however one of them misses the UFO and the alien stays the earth. Elliot finds that, and he named the alien ET. Elliot takes ET his house and he starts to take care of him. I think this movie is very famous and popular. The director is Steven Spielberg. He is so famous director. His many films are wonderful. ET is one of them. I like love movie. The music of this movie is known by many people. I like it. The tone and camera-work are excellent. I like the characters. I love ET. He is an alien and his appearance is not good, however he is so charming. I think almost people who have watched this movie like him. This movie has many famous scenes.

    I watched this movie when I was six or seven years old for the first time. I strongly remember that I shed tears at the end of the movie. This is, needles to say, one of the best movie in the world. Science fiction movies always give us dreams but the Spielberg's movies also tell and make us to think of the messages of the story. If you encounter an unknown life, what an earth would you do? This movie has incalculable influence on all over the world. It may be said that almost all of our entertainments are based on the Spielberg's movie---his dream.

    I remember the old times when it was on TV every New Year's Eve. I used to wake up from all that mess and party and just share some moments with my family watching this touching film, leaving everything we should have done after it. This is my favorite movie ever since then... It always remembers me of those old and innocent times. I was really impressed by Eliott's skills, he acted so natural. I guess everyone that watched this film just melted. It is an emotional, sensitive and educative story. It always brings me (I'm sure I'm not the only one) tears in my eyes every time I watch it. It just never gets old... It's suitable for all ages - we all have a heart :)

    It's nice to feel like a kid again now and then. It's a time of innocence and being carefree. Many great films have captured this chapter in our lives. Few have done it the way 'E.T.' does. It's one of those films that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. If you're feeling down, it can lift you back up. Pros: Amazing performances. Beautifully directed. Equally well written. Moving score. Rich cinematography. Great sense of humor. Some really touching moments. Eye-popping effects that have stood the test of time. Flows at a nice pace. Cons: The rainbow at the end is a bit much. Final thoughts: More than 30 years since it's release, 'E.T.' is still one of the most beloved films ever made. It has everything one could want from this kind of film. Many big budget films today lack heart, but it's in abundance here. It's held up and is sweet without being sappy. My rating: 5/5

    I'm not usually very emotional with these kind of emotional family films but this is was an exception. Now when I've grown up and watched in good quality as it could be I was totally shocked. I remembered from the age I was little kid that it was just cool touching and healing and something... Now it was little different experience. For the time being I think this is the most superb movie of 80's and I don't usually like Spielberg very much but this was fantastic. Original and all. Not some Independence Day like nowadays. Alien was really alien and brilliant movie, funny moments and all. Great directing, everything fits just like a glove. Maybe long movie but this one deserves it really. If you are not addicted only to some Transformers and have feelings, humor, sense of irony, childhood memories this is movie I'd never forget. Didn't cry though but ha... well. Great family scifi movie and year 1982 whoa. 12/10 if it could be possible. In its own genre, some might hate this but everyone have their own tastes, genres and all. For scifi freaks must to see if somehow missed, or if watched as a kid and don't remember much at all.

    Steven Spielberg directs this spectacular, involving, and deeply moving film that stars Henry Thomas(superb and totally believable) as Elliot, a young boy who discovers the title creature, and decides to keep it, first from his mother(lovely Dee Wallace) and then the government, who know about the alien, and want it for their own reasons... Story builds its relationships and story points believably and realistically, though perhaps too much in regards to Elliot's siblings and friends, who are at times obnoxious(just like kids would be!) and say inappropriate things, but story is so masterfully told(though admittedly manipulative as well) that it builds to a most satisfying climax, punctuated by John William's soaring score, one of his best. Amazingly,despite this being a monster hit, there was no sequel!

    Friendship is an ageless,timeless subject.The appeal of E.T. and the reason it has never lost appeal is it's unique approach to that subject.We have a space alien.Not the kind that is seeking to control,dominate,or destroy the world,but a tender caring soul.His appearance is somewhat freakish to the first human he encounters,young Elliot,who no doubt is just as freakish in return to the alien.The film then becomes a somewhat comical yet tender "getting to know you" type of story.Also comical are the efforts of young Elliot and his siblings to keep E.T. hid from view from Mom and all others.The film is a timeless treasure easily placed with the Wizard of Oz,among others.

    E.T. is an American science fiction movie. Actually, I rarely watch science fiction movies, but I love this movie. A small boy, Elliott found ET in the forest. Elliott wants to help ET because researchers also want ET to study. He decided to live with ET in his room. Gradually, they reach out to each other. However, on Halloween, something sad happens to them... The reason I love this movie is because of the uniqueness. In this movie, a lot of mysterious things happen one after another, which made me excited! I wish I were Elliot, I thought. He experiences many unbelievable things. For example, he flies riding on a bicycle. If you want to watch science fiction movie, I recommend you this movie.

    E.T. The Extra Terrestrial is an excellent family movie as it deals with friendship, trust, love, and has humor and adventure. When a kid thinks he sees something in his backyard, he goes and checks it out and finds an alien. He takes the alien inside and hides him in his closet as he tries to learn about it. He shows it to his siblings who are stunned by this discovery to and all of them learn from one another as they get E.T. to talk and the four can communicate with one another. Now they must get E.T. home and he needs to get to his ship before he is found out and taken in. E.T. is pretty much a perfect family movie as it shows great love between the children and E.T., friendship for the same reason, trust as they must now trust each other to not tell about E.T. and the adventure part of the film is terrific as there is the chase scene near the end which is so neat when it is fun and exciting and then becomes magical when they fly. E.T. is a movie that is more of a movie to see then explain so I'll cut this short and hope that you see the movie and watch all its superb wonders inside. Grade: A-

    This is the work which I described the strange friendship of a boy and an alien in and is an undying masterpiece. The good point of this movie is two. The first is the majesty of the back ground music. Impressive music is used simply because it is the work of the genre called SF extending over the space. It gives depth in a view of the world. It is music appropriate for tying the earth and space, a boy and an alien. Particularly, the music of the scene where a bicycle floats in the sky excites me so much. I can be impressed now just to listen to the music. The second is attractiveness of E.T. The process that becomes an important friend while I spend it with an older brother with a younger sister of Eliot and him is splendid. To an alien, they had an image to invade the earth, but this work wipes out the image in those days. In the novelty, I am surprised. If everybody watches this movie, adult will long for childhood, and the child may enjoy it purely. It is a movie wanting any person to watch.

    E.T. is an American science fiction movie. Actually, I rarely watch science fiction movies, but I love this movie. A small boy, Elliott found ET in the forest. Elliott wants to help ET because researchers also want ET to study. He decided to live with ET in his room. Gradually, they reach out to each other. However, on Halloween, something sad happens to them... The reason I love this movie is because of the uniqueness. In this movie, a lot of mysterious things happen one after another, which made me excited! I wish I were Elliot, I thought. He experiences many unbelievable things. For example, he flies riding on a bicycle. If you want to watch science fiction movie, I recommend you this movie.

    E.T. The Extra Terrestrial is an excellent family movie as it deals with friendship, trust, love, and has humor and adventure. When a kid thinks he sees something in his backyard, he goes and checks it out and finds an alien. He takes the alien inside and hides him in his closet as he tries to learn about it. He shows it to his siblings who are stunned by this discovery to and all of them learn from one another as they get E.T. to talk and the four can communicate with one another. Now they must get E.T. home and he needs to get to his ship before he is found out and taken in. E.T. is pretty much a perfect family movie as it shows great love between the children and E.T., friendship for the same reason, trust as they must now trust each other to not tell about E.T. and the adventure part of the film is terrific as there is the chase scene near the end which is so neat when it is fun and exciting and then becomes magical when they fly. E.T. is a movie that is more of a movie to see then explain so I'll cut this short and hope that you see the movie and watch all its superb wonders inside. Grade: A-

    This is the work which I described the strange friendship of a boy and an alien in and is an undying masterpiece. The good point of this movie is two. The first is the majesty of the back ground music. Impressive music is used simply because it is the work of the genre called SF extending over the space. It gives depth in a view of the world. It is music appropriate for tying the earth and space, a boy and an alien. Particularly, the music of the scene where a bicycle floats in the sky excites me so much. I can be impressed now just to listen to the music. The second is attractiveness of E.T. The process that becomes an important friend while I spend it with an older brother with a younger sister of Eliot and him is splendid. To an alien, they had an image to invade the earth, but this work wipes out the image in those days. In the novelty, I am surprised. If everybody watches this movie, adult will long for childhood, and the child may enjoy it purely. It is a movie wanting any person to watch.

    Aliens come to the earth, however one of them misses the UFO and the alien stays the earth. Elliot finds that, and he named the alien ET. Elliot takes ET his house and he starts to take care of him. I think this movie is very famous and popular. The director is Steven Spielberg. He is so famous director. His many films are wonderful. ET is one of them. I like love movie. The music of this movie is known by many people. I like it. The tone and camera-work are excellent. I like the characters. I love ET. He is an alien and his appearance is not good, however he is so charming. I think almost people who have watched this movie like him. This movie has many famous scenes. In the last scene, I was so moved. I love this movie. It made me feel happy. I recommend you to watch this movie.

    I watched this movie when I was six or seven years old for the first time. I strongly remember that I shed tears at the end of the movie. This is, needles to say, one of the best movie in the world. Science fiction movies always give us dreams but the Spielberg's movies also tell and make us to think of the messages of the story. If you encounter an unknown life, what an earth would you do? This movie has incalculable influence on all over the world. It may be said that almost all of our entertainments are based on the Spielberg's movie---his dream.

    I remember the old times when it was on TV every New Year's Eve. I used to wake up from all that mess and party and just share some moments with my family watching this touching film, leaving everything we should have done after it. This is my favorite movie ever since then... It always remembers me of those old and innocent times. I was really impressed by Eliott's skills, he acted so natural. I guess everyone that watched this film just melted. It is an emotional, sensitive and educative story. It always brings me (I'm sure I'm not the only one) tears in my eyes every time I watch it. It just never gets old... It's suitable for all ages - we all have a heart :)

    It's nice to feel like a kid again now and then. It's a time of innocence and being carefree. Many great films have captured this chapter in our lives. Few have done it the way 'E.T.' does. It's one of those films that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. If you're feeling down, it can lift you back up. Pros: Amazing performances. Beautifully directed. Equally well written. Moving score. Rich cinematography. Great sense of humor. Some really touching moments. Eye-popping effects that have stood the test of time. Flows at a nice pace. Cons: The rainbow at the end is a bit much. Final thoughts: More than 30 years since it's release, 'E.T.' is still one of the most beloved films ever made. It has everything one could want from this kind of film. Many big budget films today lack heart, but it's in abundance here. It's held up and is sweet without being sappy. My rating: 5/5

    I'm not usually very emotional with these kind of emotional family films but this is was an exception. Now when I've grown up and watched in good quality as it could be I was totally shocked. I remembered from the age I was little kid that it was just cool touching and healing and something... Now it was little different experience. For the time being I think this is the most superb movie of 80's and I don't usually like Spielberg very much but this was fantastic. Original and all. Not some Independence Day like nowadays. Alien was really alien and brilliant movie, funny moments and all. Great directing, everything fits just like a glove. Maybe long movie but this one deserves it really. If you are not addicted only to some Transformers and have feelings, humor, sense of irony, childhood memories this is movie I'd never forget. Didn't cry though but ha... well. Great family scifi movie and year 1982 whoa. 12/10 if it could be possible. In its own genre, some might hate this but everyone have their own tastes, genres and all. For scifi freaks must to see if somehow missed, or if watched as a kid and don't remember much at all.

    Steven Spielberg directs this spectacular, involving, and deeply moving film that stars Henry Thomas(superb and totally believable) as Elliot, a young boy who discovers the title creature, and decides to keep it, first from his mother(lovely Dee Wallace) and then the government, who know about the alien, and want it for their own reasons... Story builds its relationships and story points believably and realistically, though perhaps too much in regards to Elliot's siblings and friends, who are at times obnoxious(just like kids would be!) and say inappropriate things, but story is so masterfully told(though admittedly manipulative as well) that it builds to a most satisfying climax, punctuated by John William's soaring score, one of his best. Amazingly,despite this being a monster hit, there was no sequel!

    Friendship is an ageless,timeless subject.The appeal of E.T. and the reason it has never lost appeal is it's unique approach to that subject.We have a space alien.Not the kind that is seeking to control,dominate,or destroy the world,but a tender caring soul.His appearance is somewhat freakish to the first human he encounters,young Elliot,who no doubt is just as freakish in return to the alien.The film then becomes a somewhat comical yet tender "getting to know you" type of story.Also comical are the efforts of young Elliot and his siblings to keep E.T. hid from view from Mom and all others.The film is a timeless treasure easily placed with the Wizard of Oz,among others.
