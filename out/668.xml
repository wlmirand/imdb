    I saw this film on its initial release in Norfolk, VA. I found it to be one of the most nauseating and evil film ever made. How anyone could justify allowing anyone with a penchant for raw carnage loose in society is not qualified to be in the medical profession. George Tatum is not just a delusional killer, he ENJOYS the act of murder. If you look at the scene where he, albeit allegedly kills his father and a hooker as a young boy, he did so with malice afore thought. Let's not forget the scene where a young woman is assaulted by a stranger as she goes into the backyard, he laughs. Obviously, a seriously disturbed individual. What's worse, no one seems to notice until the deaths of his father. How he manages to become lucid as an adult is ludicrous at best. Giv-ing LSD or whatever drugs they used to degrade a penchant for delus-ions and murder, to a child is just bad medical practice; especially for someone who is obviously a dangerous psychopath. This film is sleazy and repugnant. Romano Scavolini obviously has a qualm with women on top. Anyone who enjoys this piece of bilious trash must, also, have a deep rooted hatred of anyone with a soul.

    Once again, in a slasher movie, the people behave like nobody else would in that situation, unless they knew they were in a movie and they knew it was their job to act dumber than roadkill. Check this lot out: 1. Would you REALLY leave an adult patient who, as a child, hacked up his father and the woman he was having an affair with using an axe, alone as soon as he was released... regardless of what 'experimental drug' he was on?! 2. If you received a phone call which told you your kid had been stabbed by a mysterious stranger and was bleeding to death, wouldn't it be wise to inform the caller to contact the hospital FIRST, rather than wait till you got off a private boat with your beau, got dressed and rushed home in your car? 3. Your nine year old son is suspected of the murder of his best friend and a teenage girl. I would suggest that a) You as his mother would not be able to go out the following evening and have a great time at a party and b) The chances of finding a babysitter for this potentially psychotic tyke would be slim to none. 4. ALWAYS aim for the head with a gun. Bullets to the chest don't work... they only slow down your pursuer. When will they learn?! Yep, this is a disjointed effort indeed, with a meandering story full of weird goings-on. The best entertainment value can be found in unintentional laughs, like the bubble bath foam that emits from the mental guy's mouth whenever he has a 'fit', or the horrendous acting you can find in most scenes. If you can hold on though, it delivers the goods in the final reel, with decapitations and bloody stabbings aplenty. It's just that the rest, well... it's a bit crap, isn't it? 4/10

    I'd wanted to see Nightmare for years, especially as a young Savini fan, but ensuing controversies and time prevented me from watching it until tonight. Sure, I'd come across it from time to time in a reference or review book but tracking down a copy in the US seemed to never work out for me. Cut to a sick-day in 2012, and internet movies, and finally, this grim little darling was mine for the watching. Tonally, I found Nightmare similar to Pieces, what with it's childhood traumas and bloody ways of dealing with them, but Nightmare has a certain raw charm all of its own. It's not a very *good* movie, but it moves along at a decent pace and is just so bizarre in its execution. Our killer, George Tatum, is one of the more debonair axe-wielders of the slasher generation, but most of Baird Stafford's performance consists of squealing, foaming at the mouth, and giving Ken Doll-esque lingering looks at the camera whether he's killing or sleeping or walking about. George was being treated for his myriad mental issues under an experimental program and when he's deemed cured, he's simply let loose in NYC (delightfully grimy, pre-Giuliani NYC) to go to sex shows (bad idea!) and then head south to kill a very special family. Said family seemed over the top, what with constant prankster/brat CJ and constantly screaming and slapping mom Susan...until I realized I'd seen similar behavior at the local Wal-Mart on more than one occasion. That odd behavior by the "normal" cast members is one of the more delightful things about Nightmare. Very few things happen in a way that they would happen in real life. People over-react to nothing, but are yet strangely unmoved by dead bodies. Children are taken to crime scenes and questioned in front of bloody corpses. There's rarely a clear sense of who any character is at any given time. The doctors never bothered to investigate whether George's traumatic dreams actually happened. Mom often just shrieks for no reason. There's an extended scene of a meeting with the real estate agent, and a C&W bar performance, and lots of local radio DJ chatter. It all just lurches along until a rather ludicrous (but fun!) ending. The gore (by all accounts courtesy of Ed French and NOT Savini) was nice and grim and well done for the most part (not counting a few obvious prosthetics) - rarely these days does soft tissue trauma seem so gooshy. The gore wasn't as wall-to-wall as I'd built up in my head but I suppose there was enough. If you're in the mood to revisit the early 80s via slasher films, you'll probably have a good time with Nightmare as long as you can handle the inherent strangeness of it all. It really is like a bleak little time capsule of an era long-gone. ff

    Mental patient George Tatum (Baird Stafford) is set free after it is assumed that the treatment and the experimental drugs that he received have been successful. Of course, the assumption is entirely wrong, and the genuinely insane George, a man who's had severe psycho-sexual issues since a traumatic childhood incident, ultimately embarks on a road trip. While George's story is going on, a Florida mother named Susan Temper (Sharon Smith), a woman who REALLY lives up to her name, is having to deal with a brood of kids including C.J. (C.J. Cooke), a trouble maker with a macabre sense of humour. Eventually these two stories come together, as George terrorizes the Temper family. Writer / director Romano Scavolini's notorious 1981 slasher is a true shocker, the kind of movie certain to please those whose tastes tend towards the sordid, trashy, brutal, and disturbing. And once we see in its entirety the flashback to George's childhood, the images of which often appear briefly, you'll see what I mean by disturbing. The blood may be of the bright red movie variety, but the ample gore - the work of Cleve Hall and Edward French, and not Tom Savini as some prints still claim - is still quite a hoot to behold. The movie starts off on exactly the right foot with, appropriately enough, a nightmare sequence, and establishes a certain very grim and very gritty feel; this is the kind of movie some people may feel dirty watching. George's 42nd Street adventure merely adds to this atmosphere. The meek looking Stafford does an excellent and all too convincing job; his character, despite his savage acts, actually comes off as more sympathetic than the Susan character. He really is the best performer in this whole thing. A particular pair of shock moments that mirror each other are set up extremely well. Overall, "Nightmare", much like other movies from the same period as "Don't Go in the House" and "Maniac", achieves a true, amazing creepiness and nastiness that lingers after the movie is over. Some viewers may find the final story twist not too hard to figure out, but the true experience, as they say, is the journey, not the destination. And "Nightmare" gets high marks for being a truly morbid journey. Eight out of 10.

    I've heard a lot about this movie that made me want to see it & when I finally got to watch it I never felt a greater sense of disappointment. I believe all the reviews are overrated this movie isn't that gory or creepy, the story is very slow, and I lost interest very early in the movie but waited for it to pick up & was very upset when it didn't. I don't recommend this to any die hard horror fan. This is more for the easily scared & grossed out or the easily amused seeing how the plot wasn't too interesting. The highlights of the movie are the little bit of gore & nudity it has but even that is not enough to bother going out of your way to track this movie down.

    Trying to bring the Italian giallo genre into the then-popular American slasher genre, Nightmare is a half-clever attempt. Those two extremes don't seem like a good fit, with the typical slash-and-hack, one-by-one structure of the slasher genre mixing a bit awkwardly with the more flamboyant, open-ended and director-focused giallo film movement. "Nightmare" isn't particularly coherent and can feel a bit half-hearted at times, but it has enough startling moments and a truly twisted (and brutal) view of sexuality to at least be interesting beyond it's initial viewing. Often considered a Grindhouse staple, it shares the qualities of many other films of that "genre": lousy dubbing, horrid acting, completely conspicious continuity blunders, a soundtrack and film print that makes the viewer feel like their head is being held under muddy water. It's also unusually bleak and morally ambiguous for an American film, a telling sign that this was directed by an European. There's also a sense of the American-slasher puritanism, as noticed by the Killer's view of promiscious adults around him, but it's not quite as black-and-white as many of the like-minded films at the time. Largely because we're asked to look at the film's largely unseen killer with a more subjective eye. "Nightmare" may be poorly made, although a few cat-and-mouse sequences are well-staged and engaging enough, but it's far from useless. It's cross between American DIY ethos and lavish, fetishitistic European flavoring is uneven and sloppy but always weird and alluring enough to keep you watching. The film's modest cult following is understandable.

    in 1981 i remember seeing this either at the cinema (doubtful) or on a VHS tape.due to its nature these types of films-video nasties-proved very popular amongst me and my horror film loving friends.here in the uk some of these films were easier to get hold of than others.this was a film i only vaguely remember seeing and its notoriety was not known to me at the time.so its been almost 30 years since i last saw it and last night i sat down to watch it once more..film stock is not very good so the picture is not perfect,in fact in some places its pretty awful....which just about sums the film up..the box has a quote on the front which reads.."the most repulsive,offensive,degrading,gory,depraved and horrifying movie ever made"..HAH !! only if you are a five year old child.like the evil dead and driller killer,its just terrible.it strives for horror but instead it bores you rigid.bad acting,some OK make up effects and hardly any gruesome deaths just make it tiresome...why this was EVER banned really is beyond me...

    This is one of the most prominent films on the legendary video nasty list. For those who do not know, this was a list of videos that were considered obscenely violent by the establishment in early 80's Britain. Nightmares in a Damaged Brain was one of the first to be tagged as problematic and it's distributor even served six months in prison for releasing the thing. The question now I suppose is how does it shape up today? Well, on the one hand, it isn't at all hard to understand how it made the list in the first place. On the other hand, it still works pretty well as a sleazy grind-house slasher movie. The film in a nutshell is about a troubled man who is released from an asylum. Too early it seems, as he pretty much immediately starts committing brutal murders. The film's primary notoriety I am guessing comes from the very mean-spirited violence. There isn't an awful lot of it but when it does happen it's very gory and brutal. Particularly nasty is a knife attack on a woman in her home, while the carnage inflicted by the little boy near the end is pretty intense. The film also has some scenes in New York where the psycho visits sex shows and starts to lose his fragile mind - these sequences resemble an exploitation version of Taxi Driver. So the film is essentially well served on the violence and sleaze fronts. The biggest problem is that it drags in the middle section. In this part the story relocates to follow the goings on of a family, one which our psychopath seems to be stalking for some reason. The pacing takes a dive here when we focus on these none too interesting characters. However, the aforementioned parts that bookend the family drama are certainly not boring. Nightmares in a Damaged Brain is ultimately one of the better video nasties. Unlike many on the list it's actually pretty nasty at times. And that is kind of what you want really.

    Better known in the UK as Nightmares In A Damaged Brain, this is one of the more interesting films placed on the video nasty list. Suffering from night terrors, George (Baird Stafford) is released from a mental hospital earlier than was recommended after judging that he is sane enough to separate the real world from his incidents in his nightmares. After realising their error, a doctor, psychologist and the police try to hunt him down before he is tipped over the edge. George wanders the streets looking at strippers before he begins his search for a seemingly random family who have their own troubles with their strange, mischievous son C.J. (C.J. Cooke), The problem with the film, or should I say main problem, is that it never seems to decide what kind of film it wants to be. What starts out promisingly as a kind of Grindhouse Taxi Driver, soon switches to family drama, to police chase, to all-out stalk-and-slash. The moments when the action focuses on the family, which is the majority of the time, it loses pace and I lost sense of the main characters personal plight. George makes for an interesting 'bad' guy as he is psychologically torn and disturbed by the nightmares of a little boy butchering a man and a woman with an axe. The end, which I obviously won't reveal too much about, begins as a Halloween-esque set-piece complete with a funny mask which is rather silly and run-of-the-mill, but then suddenly engages again, as a key factor about our protagonist is revealed. Yet the director ruins it all with a rather cringe-worthy last frame, with which I shook my head in bitter disappointment. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

Often considered a Grindhouse staple, it shares the qualities of many other films of that "genre": lousy dubbing, horrid acting, completely conspicious continuity blunders, a soundtrack and film print that makes the viewer feel like their head is being held under muddy water. It's also unusually bleak and morally ambiguous for an American film, a telling sign that this was directed by an European. There's also a sense of the American-slasher puritanism, as noticed by the Killer's view of promiscious adults around him, but it's not quite as black-and-white as many of the like-minded films at the time. Largely because we're asked to look at the film's largely unseen killer with a more subjective eye. "Nightmare" may be poorly made, although a few cat-and-mouse sequences are well-staged and engaging enough, but it's far from useless. It's cross between American DIY ethos and lavish, fetishitistic European flavoring is uneven and sloppy but always weird and alluring enough to keep you watching. The film's modest cult following is understandable.

    in 1981 i remember seeing this either at the cinema (doubtful) or on a VHS tape.due to its nature these types of films-video nasties-proved very popular amongst me and my horror film loving friends.here in the uk some of these films were easier to get hold of than others.this was a film i only vaguely remember seeing and its notoriety was not known to me at the time.so its been almost 30 years since i last saw it and last night i sat down to watch it once more..film stock is not very good so the picture is not perfect,in fact in some places its pretty awful....which just about sums the film up..the box has a quote on the front which reads.."the most repulsive,offensive,degrading,gory,depraved and horrifying movie ever made"..HAH !! only if you are a five year old child.like the evil dead and driller killer,its just terrible.it strives for horror but instead it bores you rigid.bad acting,some OK make up effects and hardly any gruesome deaths just make it tiresome...why this was EVER banned really is beyond me...

    This is one of the most prominent films on the legendary video nasty list. For those who do not know, this was a list of videos that were considered obscenely violent by the establishment in early 80's Britain. Nightmares in a Damaged Brain was one of the first to be tagged as problematic and it's distributor even served six months in prison for releasing the thing. The question now I suppose is how does it shape up today? Well, on the one hand, it isn't at all hard to understand how it made the list in the first place. On the other hand, it still works pretty well as a sleazy grind-house slasher movie. The film in a nutshell is about a troubled man who is released from an asylum. Too early it seems, as he pretty much immediately starts committing brutal murders. The film's primary notoriety I am guessing comes from the very mean-spirited violence. There isn't an awful lot of it but when it does happen it's very gory and brutal. Particularly nasty is a knife attack on a woman in her home, while the carnage inflicted by the little boy near the end is pretty intense. The film also has some scenes in New York where the psycho visits sex shows and starts to lose his fragile mind - these sequences resemble an exploitation version of Taxi Driver. So the film is essentially well served on the violence and sleaze fronts. The biggest problem is that it drags in the middle section. In this part the story relocates to follow the goings on of a family, one which our psychopath seems to be stalking for some reason. The pacing takes a dive here when we focus on these none too interesting characters. However, the aforementioned parts that bookend the family drama are certainly not boring. Nightmares in a Damaged Brain is ultimately one of the better video nasties. Unlike many on the list it's actually pretty nasty at times. And that is kind of what you want really.

    Better known in the UK as Nightmares In A Damaged Brain, this is one of the more interesting films placed on the video nasty list. Suffering from night terrors, George (Baird Stafford) is released from a mental hospital earlier than was recommended after judging that he is sane enough to separate the real world from his incidents in his nightmares. After realising their error, a doctor, psychologist and the police try to hunt him down before he is tipped over the edge. George wanders the streets looking at strippers before he begins his search for a seemingly random family who have their own troubles with their strange, mischievous son C.J. (C.J. Cooke), The problem with the film, or should I say main problem, is that it never seems to decide what kind of film it wants to be. What starts out promisingly as a kind of Grindhouse Taxi Driver, soon switches to family drama, to police chase, to all-out stalk-and-slash. The moments when the action focuses on the family, which is the majority of the time, it loses pace and I lost sense of the main characters personal plight. George makes for an interesting 'bad' guy as he is psychologically torn and disturbed by the nightmares of a little boy butchering a man and a woman with an axe. The end, which I obviously won't reveal too much about, begins as a Halloween-esque set-piece complete with a funny mask which is rather silly and run-of-the-mill, but then suddenly engages again, as a key factor about our protagonist is revealed. Yet the director ruins it all with a rather cringe-worthy last frame, with which I shook my head in bitter disappointment. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    I saw this film on its initial release in Norfolk, VA. I found it to be one of the most nauseating and evil film ever made. How anyone could justify allowing anyone with a penchant for raw carnage loose in society is not qualified to be in the medical profession. George Tatum is not just a delusional killer, he ENJOYS the act of murder. If you look at the scene where he, albeit allegedly kills his father and a hooker as a young boy, he did so with malice afore thought. Let's not forget the scene where a young woman is assaulted by a stranger as she goes into the backyard, he laughs. Obviously, a seriously disturbed individual. What's worse, no one seems to notice until the deaths of his father. How he manages to become lucid as an adult is ludicrous at best. Giv-ing LSD or whatever drugs they used to degrade a penchant for delus-ions and murder, to a child is just bad medical practice; especially for someone who is obviously a dangerous psychopath. This film is sleazy and repugnant. Romano Scavolini obviously has a qualm with women on top. Anyone who enjoys this piece of bilious trash must, also, have a deep rooted hatred of anyone with a soul.

    Once again, in a slasher movie, the people behave like nobody else would in that situation, unless they knew they were in a movie and they knew it was their job to act dumber than roadkill. Check this lot out: 1. Would you REALLY leave an adult patient who, as a child, hacked up his father and the woman he was having an affair with using an axe, alone as soon as he was released... regardless of what 'experimental drug' he was on?! 2. If you received a phone call which told you your kid had been stabbed by a mysterious stranger and was bleeding to death, wouldn't it be wise to inform the caller to contact the hospital FIRST, rather than wait till you got off a private boat with your beau, got dressed and rushed home in your car? 3. Your nine year old son is suspected of the murder of his best friend and a teenage girl. I would suggest that a) You as his mother would not be able to go out the following evening and have a great time at a party and b) The chances of finding a babysitter for this potentially psychotic tyke would be slim to none. 4. ALWAYS aim for the head with a gun. Bullets to the chest don't work... they only slow down your pursuer. When will they learn?! Yep, this is a disjointed effort indeed, with a meandering story full of weird goings-on. The best entertainment value can be found in unintentional laughs, like the bubble bath foam that emits from the mental guy's mouth whenever he has a 'fit', or the horrendous acting you can find in most scenes. If you can hold on though, it delivers the goods in the final reel, with decapitations and bloody stabbings aplenty. It's just that the rest, well... it's a bit crap, isn't it? 4/10

    I'd wanted to see Nightmare for years, especially as a young Savini fan, but ensuing controversies and time prevented me from watching it until tonight. Sure, I'd come across it from time to time in a reference or review book but tracking down a copy in the US seemed to never work out for me. Cut to a sick-day in 2012, and internet movies, and finally, this grim little darling was mine for the watching. Tonally, I found Nightmare similar to Pieces, what with it's childhood traumas and bloody ways of dealing with them, but Nightmare has a certain raw charm all of its own. It's not a very *good* movie, but it moves along at a decent pace and is just so bizarre in its execution. Our killer, George Tatum, is one of the more debonair axe-wielders of the slasher generation, but most of Baird Stafford's performance consists of squealing, foaming at the mouth, and giving Ken Doll-esque lingering looks at the camera whether he's killing or sleeping or walking about. George was being treated for his myriad mental issues under an experimental program and when he's deemed cured, he's simply let loose in NYC (delightfully grimy, pre-Giuliani NYC) to go to sex shows (bad idea!) and then head south to kill a very special family. Said family seemed over the top, what with constant prankster/brat CJ and constantly screaming and slapping mom Susan...until I realized I'd seen similar behavior at the local Wal-Mart on more than one occasion. That odd behavior by the "normal" cast members is one of the more delightful things about Nightmare. Very few things happen in a way that they would happen in real life. People over-react to nothing, but are yet strangely unmoved by dead bodies. Children are taken to crime scenes and questioned in front of bloody corpses. There's rarely a clear sense of who any character is at any given time. The doctors never bothered to investigate whether George's traumatic dreams actually happened. Mom often just shrieks for no reason. There's an extended scene of a meeting with the real estate agent, and a C&W bar performance, and lots of local radio DJ chatter. It all just lurches along until a rather ludicrous (but fun!) ending. The gore (by all accounts courtesy of Ed French and NOT Savini) was nice and grim and well done for the most part (not counting a few obvious prosthetics) - rarely these days does soft tissue trauma seem so gooshy. The gore wasn't as wall-to-wall as I'd built up in my head but I suppose there was enough. If you're in the mood to revisit the early 80s via slasher films, you'll probably have a good time with Nightmare as long as you can handle the inherent strangeness of it all. It really is like a bleak little time capsule of an era long-gone. ff

    Mental patient George Tatum (Baird Stafford) is set free after it is assumed that the treatment and the experimental drugs that he received have been successful. Of course, the assumption is entirely wrong, and the genuinely insane George, a man who's had severe psycho-sexual issues since a traumatic childhood incident, ultimately embarks on a road trip. While George's story is going on, a Florida mother named Susan Temper (Sharon Smith), a woman who REALLY lives up to her name, is having to deal with a brood of kids including C.J. (C.J. Cooke), a trouble maker with a macabre sense of humour. Eventually these two stories come together, as George terrorizes the Temper family. Writer / director Romano Scavolini's notorious 1981 slasher is a true shocker, the kind of movie certain to please those whose tastes tend towards the sordid, trashy, brutal, and disturbing. And once we see in its entirety the flashback to George's childhood, the images of which often appear briefly, you'll see what I mean by disturbing. The blood may be of the bright red movie variety, but the ample gore - the work of Cleve Hall and Edward French, and not Tom Savini as some prints still claim - is still quite a hoot to behold. The movie starts off on exactly the right foot with, appropriately enough, a nightmare sequence, and establishes a certain very grim and very gritty feel; this is the kind of movie some people may feel dirty watching. George's 42nd Street adventure merely adds to this atmosphere. The meek looking Stafford does an excellent and all too convincing job; his character, despite his savage acts, actually comes off as more sympathetic than the Susan character. He really is the best performer in this whole thing. A particular pair of shock moments that mirror each other are set up extremely well. Overall, "Nightmare", much like other movies from the same period as "Don't Go in the House" and "Maniac", achieves a true, amazing creepiness and nastiness that lingers after the movie is over. Some viewers may find the final story twist not too hard to figure out, but the true experience, as they say, is the journey, not the destination. And "Nightmare" gets high marks for being a truly morbid journey. Eight out of 10.

    I've heard a lot about this movie that made me want to see it & when I finally got to watch it I never felt a greater sense of disappointment. I believe all the reviews are overrated this movie isn't that gory or creepy, the story is very slow, and I lost interest very early in the movie but waited for it to pick up & was very upset when it didn't. I don't recommend this to any die hard horror fan. This is more for the easily scared & grossed out or the easily amused seeing how the plot wasn't too interesting. The highlights of the movie are the little bit of gore & nudity it has but even that is not enough to bother going out of your way to track this movie down.

    Trying to bring the Italian giallo genre into the then-popular American slasher genre, Nightmare is a half-clever attempt.

If you're in the mood to revisit the early 80s via slasher films, you'll probably have a good time with Nightmare as long as you can handle the inherent strangeness of it all. It really is like a bleak little time capsule of an era long-gone. ff

    Mental patient George Tatum (Baird Stafford) is set free after it is assumed that the treatment and the experimental drugs that he received have been successful. Of course, the assumption is entirely wrong, and the genuinely insane George, a man who's had severe psycho-sexual issues since a traumatic childhood incident, ultimately embarks on a road trip. While George's story is going on, a Florida mother named Susan Temper (Sharon Smith), a woman who REALLY lives up to her name, is having to deal with a brood of kids including C.J. (C.J. Cooke), a trouble maker with a macabre sense of humour. Eventually these two stories come together, as George terrorizes the Temper family. Writer / director Romano Scavolini's notorious 1981 slasher is a true shocker, the kind of movie certain to please those whose tastes tend towards the sordid, trashy, brutal, and disturbing. And once we see in its entirety the flashback to George's childhood, the images of which often appear briefly, you'll see what I mean by disturbing. The blood may be of the bright red movie variety, but the ample gore - the work of Cleve Hall and Edward French, and not Tom Savini as some prints still claim - is still quite a hoot to behold. The movie starts off on exactly the right foot with, appropriately enough, a nightmare sequence, and establishes a certain very grim and very gritty feel; this is the kind of movie some people may feel dirty watching. George's 42nd Street adventure merely adds to this atmosphere. The meek looking Stafford does an excellent and all too convincing job; his character, despite his savage acts, actually comes off as more sympathetic than the Susan character. He really is the best performer in this whole thing. A particular pair of shock moments that mirror each other are set up extremely well. Overall, "Nightmare", much like other movies from the same period as "Don't Go in the House" and "Maniac", achieves a true, amazing creepiness and nastiness that lingers after the movie is over. Some viewers may find the final story twist not too hard to figure out, but the true experience, as they say, is the journey, not the destination. And "Nightmare" gets high marks for being a truly morbid journey. Eight out of 10.

    I've heard a lot about this movie that made me want to see it & when I finally got to watch it I never felt a greater sense of disappointment. I believe all the reviews are overrated this movie isn't that gory or creepy, the story is very slow, and I lost interest very early in the movie but waited for it to pick up & was very upset when it didn't. I don't recommend this to any die hard horror fan. This is more for the easily scared & grossed out or the easily amused seeing how the plot wasn't too interesting. The highlights of the movie are the little bit of gore & nudity it has but even that is not enough to bother going out of your way to track this movie down.

    Trying to bring the Italian giallo genre into the then-popular American slasher genre, Nightmare is a half-clever attempt. Those two extremes don't seem like a good fit, with the typical slash-and-hack, one-by-one structure of the slasher genre mixing a bit awkwardly with the more flamboyant, open-ended and director-focused giallo film movement. "Nightmare" isn't particularly coherent and can feel a bit half-hearted at times, but it has enough startling moments and a truly twisted (and brutal) view of sexuality to at least be interesting beyond it's initial viewing. Often considered a Grindhouse staple, it shares the qualities of many other films of that "genre": lousy dubbing, horrid acting, completely conspicious continuity blunders, a soundtrack and film print that makes the viewer feel like their head is being held under muddy water. It's also unusually bleak and morally ambiguous for an American film, a telling sign that this was directed by an European. There's also a sense of the American-slasher puritanism, as noticed by the Killer's view of promiscious adults around him, but it's not quite as black-and-white as many of the like-minded films at the time. Largely because we're asked to look at the film's largely unseen killer with a more subjective eye. "Nightmare" may be poorly made, although a few cat-and-mouse sequences are well-staged and engaging enough, but it's far from useless. It's cross between American DIY ethos and lavish, fetishitistic European flavoring is uneven and sloppy but always weird and alluring enough to keep you watching. The film's modest cult following is understandable.

    in 1981 i remember seeing this either at the cinema (doubtful) or on a VHS tape.due to its nature these types of films-video nasties-proved very popular amongst me and my horror film loving friends.here in the uk some of these films were easier to get hold of than others.this was a film i only vaguely remember seeing and its notoriety was not known to me at the time.so its been almost 30 years since i last saw it and last night i sat down to watch it once more..film stock is not very good so the picture is not perfect,in fact in some places its pretty awful....which just about sums the film up..the box has a quote on the front which reads.."the most repulsive,offensive,degrading,gory,depraved and horrifying movie ever made"..HAH !! only if you are a five year old child.like the evil dead and driller killer,its just terrible.it strives for horror but instead it bores you rigid.bad acting,some OK make up effects and hardly any gruesome deaths just make it tiresome...why this was EVER banned really is beyond me...

    This is one of the most prominent films on the legendary video nasty list. For those who do not know, this was a list of videos that were considered obscenely violent by the establishment in early 80's Britain. Nightmares in a Damaged Brain was one of the first to be tagged as problematic and it's distributor even served six months in prison for releasing the thing. The question now I suppose is how does it shape up today? Well, on the one hand, it isn't at all hard to understand how it made the list in the first place. On the other hand, it still works pretty well as a sleazy grind-house slasher movie. The film in a nutshell is about a troubled man who is released from an asylum. Too early it seems, as he pretty much immediately starts committing brutal murders. The film's primary notoriety I am guessing comes from the very mean-spirited violence. There isn't an awful lot of it but when it does happen it's very gory and brutal. Particularly nasty is a knife attack on a woman in her home, while the carnage inflicted by the little boy near the end is pretty intense. The film also has some scenes in New York where the psycho visits sex shows and starts to lose his fragile mind - these sequences resemble an exploitation version of Taxi Driver. So the film is essentially well served on the violence and sleaze fronts. The biggest problem is that it drags in the middle section. In this part the story relocates to follow the goings on of a family, one which our psychopath seems to be stalking for some reason. The pacing takes a dive here when we focus on these none too interesting characters. However, the aforementioned parts that bookend the family drama are certainly not boring. Nightmares in a Damaged Brain is ultimately one of the better video nasties. Unlike many on the list it's actually pretty nasty at times. And that is kind of what you want really.

    Better known in the UK as Nightmares In A Damaged Brain, this is one of the more interesting films placed on the video nasty list. Suffering from night terrors, George (Baird Stafford) is released from a mental hospital earlier than was recommended after judging that he is sane enough to separate the real world from his incidents in his nightmares. After realising their error, a doctor, psychologist and the police try to hunt him down before he is tipped over the edge. George wanders the streets looking at strippers before he begins his search for a seemingly random family who have their own troubles with their strange, mischievous son C.J. (C.J. Cooke), The problem with the film, or should I say main problem, is that it never seems to decide what kind of film it wants to be. What starts out promisingly as a kind of Grindhouse Taxi Driver, soon switches to family drama, to police chase, to all-out stalk-and-slash. The moments when the action focuses on the family, which is the majority of the time, it loses pace and I lost sense of the main characters personal plight. George makes for an interesting 'bad' guy as he is psychologically torn and disturbed by the nightmares of a little boy butchering a man and a woman with an axe. The end, which I obviously won't reveal too much about, begins as a Halloween-esque set-piece complete with a funny mask which is rather silly and run-of-the-mill, but then suddenly engages again, as a key factor about our protagonist is revealed. Yet the director ruins it all with a rather cringe-worthy last frame, with which I shook my head in bitter disappointment. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    I saw this film on its initial release in Norfolk, VA. I found it to be one of the most nauseating and evil film ever made. How anyone could justify allowing anyone with a penchant for raw carnage loose in society is not qualified to be in the medical profession. George Tatum is not just a delusional killer, he ENJOYS the act of murder. If you look at the scene where he, albeit allegedly kills his father and a hooker as a young boy, he did so with malice afore thought. Let's not forget the scene where a young woman is assaulted by a stranger as she goes into the backyard, he laughs. Obviously, a seriously disturbed individual. What's worse, no one seems to notice until the deaths of his father. How he manages to become lucid as an adult is ludicrous at best. Giv-ing LSD or whatever drugs they used to degrade a penchant for delus-ions and murder, to a child is just bad medical practice; especially for someone who is obviously a dangerous psychopath. This film is sleazy and repugnant. Romano Scavolini obviously has a qualm with women on top. Anyone who enjoys this piece of bilious trash must, also, have a deep rooted hatred of anyone with a soul.

    Once again, in a slasher movie, the people behave like nobody else would in that situation, unless they knew they were in a movie and they knew it was their job to act dumber than roadkill. Check this lot out: 1. Would you REALLY leave an adult patient who, as a child, hacked up his father and the woman he was having an affair with using an axe, alone as soon as he was released... regardless of what 'experimental drug' he was on?! 2. If you received a phone call which told you your kid had been stabbed by a mysterious stranger and was bleeding to death, wouldn't it be wise to inform the caller to contact the hospital FIRST, rather than wait till you got off a private boat with your beau, got dressed and rushed home in your car? 3. Your nine year old son is suspected of the murder of his best friend and a teenage girl. I would suggest that a) You as his mother would not be able to go out the following evening and have a great time at a party and b) The chances of finding a babysitter for this potentially psychotic tyke would be slim to none. 4. ALWAYS aim for the head with a gun. Bullets to the chest don't work... they only slow down your pursuer. When will they learn?! Yep, this is a disjointed effort indeed, with a meandering story full of weird goings-on. The best entertainment value can be found in unintentional laughs, like the bubble bath foam that emits from the mental guy's mouth whenever he has a 'fit', or the horrendous acting you can find in most scenes. If you can hold on though, it delivers the goods in the final reel, with decapitations and bloody stabbings aplenty. It's just that the rest, well... it's a bit crap, isn't it? 4/10

    I'd wanted to see Nightmare for years, especially as a young Savini fan, but ensuing controversies and time prevented me from watching it until tonight. Sure, I'd come across it from time to time in a reference or review book but tracking down a copy in the US seemed to never work out for me. Cut to a sick-day in 2012, and internet movies, and finally, this grim little darling was mine for the watching. Tonally, I found Nightmare similar to Pieces, what with it's childhood traumas and bloody ways of dealing with them, but Nightmare has a certain raw charm all of its own. It's not a very *good* movie, but it moves along at a decent pace and is just so bizarre in its execution. Our killer, George Tatum, is one of the more debonair axe-wielders of the slasher generation, but most of Baird Stafford's performance consists of squealing, foaming at the mouth, and giving Ken Doll-esque lingering looks at the camera whether he's killing or sleeping or walking about. George was being treated for his myriad mental issues under an experimental program and when he's deemed cured, he's simply let loose in NYC (delightfully grimy, pre-Giuliani NYC) to go to sex shows (bad idea!) and then head south to kill a very special family. Said family seemed over the top, what with constant prankster/brat CJ and constantly screaming and slapping mom Susan...until I realized I'd seen similar behavior at the local Wal-Mart on more than one occasion. That odd behavior by the "normal" cast members is one of the more delightful things about Nightmare. Very few things happen in a way that they would happen in real life. People over-react to nothing, but are yet strangely unmoved by dead bodies. Children are taken to crime scenes and questioned in front of bloody corpses. There's rarely a clear sense of who any character is at any given time. The doctors never bothered to investigate whether George's traumatic dreams actually happened. Mom often just shrieks for no reason. There's an extended scene of a meeting with the real estate agent, and a C&W bar performance, and lots of local radio DJ chatter. It all just lurches along until a rather ludicrous (but fun!) ending. The gore (by all accounts courtesy of Ed French and NOT Savini) was nice and grim and well done for the most part (not counting a few obvious prosthetics) - rarely these days does soft tissue trauma seem so gooshy. The gore wasn't as wall-to-wall as I'd built up in my head but I suppose there was enough. If you're in the mood to revisit the early 80s via slasher films, you'll probably have a good time with Nightmare as long as you can handle the inherent strangeness of it all. It really is like a bleak little time capsule of an era long-gone. ff

    Once again, in a slasher movie, the people behave like nobody else would in that situation, unless they knew they were in a movie and they knew it was their job to act dumber than roadkill. Check this lot out: 1. Would you REALLY leave an adult patient who, as a child, hacked up his father and the woman he was having an affair with using an axe, alone as soon as he was released... regardless of what 'experimental drug' he was on?! 2. If you received a phone call which told you your kid had been stabbed by a mysterious stranger and was bleeding to death, wouldn't it be wise to inform the caller to contact the hospital FIRST, rather than wait till you got off a private boat with your beau, got dressed and rushed home in your car? 3. Your nine year old son is suspected of the murder of his best friend and a teenage girl. I would suggest that a) You as his mother would not be able to go out the following evening and have a great time at a party and b) The chances of finding a babysitter for this potentially psychotic tyke would be slim to none. 4. ALWAYS aim for the head with a gun. Bullets to the chest don't work... they only slow down your pursuer. When will they learn?! Yep, this is a disjointed effort indeed, with a meandering story full of weird goings-on. The best entertainment value can be found in unintentional laughs, like the bubble bath foam that emits from the mental guy's mouth whenever he has a 'fit', or the horrendous acting you can find in most scenes. If you can hold on though, it delivers the goods in the final reel, with decapitations and bloody stabbings aplenty. It's just that the rest, well... it's a bit crap, isn't it? 4/10

    I'd wanted to see Nightmare for years, especially as a young Savini fan, but ensuing controversies and time prevented me from watching it until tonight. Sure, I'd come across it from time to time in a reference or review book but tracking down a copy in the US seemed to never work out for me. Cut to a sick-day in 2012, and internet movies, and finally, this grim little darling was mine for the watching. Tonally, I found Nightmare similar to Pieces, what with it's childhood traumas and bloody ways of dealing with them, but Nightmare has a certain raw charm all of its own. It's not a very *good* movie, but it moves along at a decent pace and is just so bizarre in its execution. Our killer, George Tatum, is one of the more debonair axe-wielders of the slasher generation, but most of Baird Stafford's performance consists of squealing, foaming at the mouth, and giving Ken Doll-esque lingering looks at the camera whether he's killing or sleeping or walking about. George was being treated for his myriad mental issues under an experimental program and when he's deemed cured, he's simply let loose in NYC (delightfully grimy, pre-Giuliani NYC) to go to sex shows (bad idea!) and then head south to kill a very special family. Said family seemed over the top, what with constant prankster/brat CJ and constantly screaming and slapping mom Susan...until I realized I'd seen similar behavior at the local Wal-Mart on more than one occasion. That odd behavior by the "normal" cast members is one of the more delightful things about Nightmare. Very few things happen in a way that they would happen in real life. People over-react to nothing, but are yet strangely unmoved by dead bodies. Children are taken to crime scenes and questioned in front of bloody corpses. There's rarely a clear sense of who any character is at any given time. The doctors never bothered to investigate whether George's traumatic dreams actually happened. Mom often just shrieks for no reason. There's an extended scene of a meeting with the real estate agent, and a C&W bar performance, and lots of local radio DJ chatter. It all just lurches along until a rather ludicrous (but fun!) ending. The gore (by all accounts courtesy of Ed French and NOT Savini) was nice and grim and well done for the most part (not counting a few obvious prosthetics) - rarely these days does soft tissue trauma seem so gooshy. The gore wasn't as wall-to-wall as I'd built up in my head but I suppose there was enough. If you're in the mood to revisit the early 80s via slasher films, you'll probably have a good time with Nightmare as long as you can handle the inherent strangeness of it all. It really is like a bleak little time capsule of an era long-gone. ff

    Mental patient George Tatum (Baird Stafford) is set free after it is assumed that the treatment and the experimental drugs that he received have been successful. Of course, the assumption is entirely wrong, and the genuinely insane George, a man who's had severe psycho-sexual issues since a traumatic childhood incident, ultimately embarks on a road trip. While George's story is going on, a Florida mother named Susan Temper (Sharon Smith), a woman who REALLY lives up to her name, is having to deal with a brood of kids including C.J. (C.J. Cooke), a trouble maker with a macabre sense of humour. Eventually these two stories come together, as George terrorizes the Temper family. Writer / director Romano Scavolini's notorious 1981 slasher is a true shocker, the kind of movie certain to please those whose tastes tend towards the sordid, trashy, brutal, and disturbing. And once we see in its entirety the flashback to George's childhood, the images of which often appear briefly, you'll see what I mean by disturbing. The blood may be of the bright red movie variety, but the ample gore - the work of Cleve Hall and Edward French, and not Tom Savini as some prints still claim - is still quite a hoot to behold. The movie starts off on exactly the right foot with, appropriately enough, a nightmare sequence, and establishes a certain very grim and very gritty feel; this is the kind of movie some people may feel dirty watching. George's 42nd Street adventure merely adds to this atmosphere. The meek looking Stafford does an excellent and all too convincing job; his character, despite his savage acts, actually comes off as more sympathetic than the Susan character. He really is the best performer in this whole thing. A particular pair of shock moments that mirror each other are set up extremely well. Overall, "Nightmare", much like other movies from the same period as "Don't Go in the House" and "Maniac", achieves a true, amazing creepiness and nastiness that lingers after the movie is over. Some viewers may find the final story twist not too hard to figure out, but the true experience, as they say, is the journey, not the destination. And "Nightmare" gets high marks for being a truly morbid journey. Eight out of 10.

    I've heard a lot about this movie that made me want to see it & when I finally got to watch it I never felt a greater sense of disappointment. I believe all the reviews are overrated this movie isn't that gory or creepy, the story is very slow, and I lost interest very early in the movie but waited for it to pick up & was very upset when it didn't. I don't recommend this to any die hard horror fan. This is more for the easily scared & grossed out or the easily amused seeing how the plot wasn't too interesting. The highlights of the movie are the little bit of gore & nudity it has but even that is not enough to bother going out of your way to track this movie down.

    Trying to bring the Italian giallo genre into the then-popular American slasher genre, Nightmare is a half-clever attempt. Those two extremes don't seem like a good fit, with the typical slash-and-hack, one-by-one structure of the slasher genre mixing a bit awkwardly with the more flamboyant, open-ended and director-focused giallo film movement. "Nightmare" isn't particularly coherent and can feel a bit half-hearted at times, but it has enough startling moments and a truly twisted (and brutal) view of sexuality to at least be interesting beyond it's initial viewing. Often considered a Grindhouse staple, it shares the qualities of many other films of that "genre": lousy dubbing, horrid acting, completely conspicious continuity blunders, a soundtrack and film print that makes the viewer feel like their head is being held under muddy water. It's also unusually bleak and morally ambiguous for an American film, a telling sign that this was directed by an European. There's also a sense of the American-slasher puritanism, as noticed by the Killer's view of promiscious adults around him, but it's not quite as black-and-white as many of the like-minded films at the time. Largely because we're asked to look at the film's largely unseen killer with a more subjective eye. "Nightmare" may be poorly made, although a few cat-and-mouse sequences are well-staged and engaging enough, but it's far from useless. It's cross between American DIY ethos and lavish, fetishitistic European flavoring is uneven and sloppy but always weird and alluring enough to keep you watching. The film's modest cult following is understandable.

    in 1981 i remember seeing this either at the cinema (doubtful) or on a VHS tape.due to its nature these types of films-video nasties-proved very popular amongst me and my horror film loving friends.here in the uk some of these films were easier to get hold of than others.this was a film i only vaguely remember seeing and its notoriety was not known to me at the time.so its been almost 30 years since i last saw it and last night i sat down to watch it once more..film stock is not very good so the picture is not perfect,in fact in some places its pretty awful....which just about sums the film up..the box has a quote on the front which reads.."the most repulsive,offensive,degrading,gory,depraved and horrifying movie ever made"..HAH !! only if you are a five year old child.like the evil dead and driller killer,its just terrible.it strives for horror but instead it bores you rigid.bad acting,some OK make up effects and hardly any gruesome deaths just make it tiresome...why this was EVER banned really is beyond me...

    This is one of the most prominent films on the legendary video nasty list. For those who do not know, this was a list of videos that were considered obscenely violent by the establishment in early 80's Britain. Nightmares in a Damaged Brain was one of the first to be tagged as problematic and it's distributor even served six months in prison for releasing the thing. The question now I suppose is how does it shape up today? Well, on the one hand, it isn't at all hard to understand how it made the list in the first place. On the other hand, it still works pretty well as a sleazy grind-house slasher movie. The film in a nutshell is about a troubled man who is released from an asylum. Too early it seems, as he pretty much immediately starts committing brutal murders. The film's primary notoriety I am guessing comes from the very mean-spirited violence. There isn't an awful lot of it but when it does happen it's very gory and brutal. Particularly nasty is a knife attack on a woman in her home, while the carnage inflicted by the little boy near the end is pretty intense. The film also has some scenes in New York where the psycho visits sex shows and starts to lose his fragile mind - these sequences resemble an exploitation version of Taxi Driver. So the film is essentially well served on the violence and sleaze fronts. The biggest problem is that it drags in the middle section. In this part the story relocates to follow the goings on of a family, one which our psychopath seems to be stalking for some reason. The pacing takes a dive here when we focus on these none too interesting characters. However, the aforementioned parts that bookend the family drama are certainly not boring. Nightmares in a Damaged Brain is ultimately one of the better video nasties. Unlike many on the list it's actually pretty nasty at times. And that is kind of what you want really.

    Better known in the UK as Nightmares In A Damaged Brain, this is one of the more interesting films placed on the video nasty list. Suffering from night terrors, George (Baird Stafford) is released from a mental hospital earlier than was recommended after judging that he is sane enough to separate the real world from his incidents in his nightmares. After realising their error, a doctor, psychologist and the police try to hunt him down before he is tipped over the edge. George wanders the streets looking at strippers before he begins his search for a seemingly random family who have their own troubles with their strange, mischievous son C.J. (C.J. Cooke), The problem with the film, or should I say main problem, is that it never seems to decide what kind of film it wants to be. What starts out promisingly as a kind of Grindhouse Taxi Driver, soon switches to family drama, to police chase, to all-out stalk-and-slash. The moments when the action focuses on the family, which is the majority of the time, it loses pace and I lost sense of the main characters personal plight. George makes for an interesting 'bad' guy as he is psychologically torn and disturbed by the nightmares of a little boy butchering a man and a woman with an axe. The end, which I obviously won't reveal too much about, begins as a Halloween-esque set-piece complete with a funny mask which is rather silly and run-of-the-mill, but then suddenly engages again, as a key factor about our protagonist is revealed. Yet the director ruins it all with a rather cringe-worthy last frame, with which I shook my head in bitter disappointment. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com
