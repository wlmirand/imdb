    Reading through their IMDb pages just now, I noticed that director Peter Hyams and action star Jean-Claude Van Damme will soon collaborate again on a thriller named "Enemies Closer". I think that's particularly good news for Van Damme, as it's my own personal and humble opinion that he accomplished his best films working with Hyams. Seemingly Hyams was the only director who brought a proper balance between demonstrating his martial arts skills and actually giving the opportunity to try and act! "Sudden Death" is a straightforward but extremely competent action flick set in a limited arena ("Die Hard" in a hockey stadium, in fact) and this "Timecop" is a more ambitious and polished Sci-Fi thriller revolving around time traveling. Hyams is more of an expert in the domain of Sci-Fi (with other semi-classic titles on his repertoire such as "Capricorn One", "Outland" and the hate-it-or-love-it cult movie "2010") and that clearly shows during the impressively staged time-catapulting sequences and the overall ease with which the convoluted and paradoxical subject matter is handled. On the other hand, the supposedly hi-tech futuristic gadgets and advanced technology looks incredibly banal and clich&eacute;d in my opinion, like for example the voice-operated cars and televisions in 2004. The plot is actually very similar to that of "Back to the Future, Part II" except  of course  with karate and gunfire instead of DeLoreans. It's all about Van Damme, as Time Enforcement Corps agent Max Walker, traveling back and forth in time to prevent naughty people from meddling with the future before it occurs. The sleazy Senator McComb teleports himself back from 2004 to 1994 to prevent his younger self from making the wrong financial decisions that will cost him the Presidential elections and, during the attempt to stop him, Max Walker discover the exact reasons why his wife got murdered that same year. Although he'll never win any Oscars, I really think Van Damme gives an adequate performance in "Timecop", with a word of thanks to the script and the supportive cast including Mia Sara and Bruce McGill. Best performance comes (as all too often in action movies) from the villain, with Ron Silver depicting a gloriously hateful corrupt politician. It's never made clear what happens to the time-traveling vehicles when arriving in the past. At least the DeLorean in "Back to the Future" always stayed with its passengers.

    This is pretty run-of-the-mill as far as sci-fi goes, and Van-Damme's acting wasn't any better than it was in his other films - contrary to popular opinion - but Peter Hyams' competent direction keeps the thing moving forward at a brisk pace, and Ron Silver makes for a wicked baddie that rivals his work in Blue Steel. If only the action were more exciting. Most of it consists of Walker staying in one position shooting at another guy, and vice-versa until somebody goes down for good. The shootouts lack energy and a sense of life for the most part. The fight scenes are......okay, but nothing that can compete with what I've seen in other actioners from that era. Oh yeah, and what was up with the villain's death scene? That was some frighteningly terrible CGI. I guess they were trying to rival the liquid metal effects in T2 and failed miserably. In fact, the entire finale was way too dark, like pitch black. I remember catching the finale on TV back in the day and noticed it was excessively dark then, too, but Blu-ray doesn't seem to have corrected the problem. Well, flaws aside, this is still one of Van Damme's better films, with some amusing moments here and there.

    I have watched Timecop at least three times, I do not remember much. I have read the synopsis of the movie on the IMDb site and none of it helps. Here is Timecop as best I know- JCVD does the spinning roundhouse kick thing, also there is a mall, i think a lot of the movie is in a mall. A lady is in the movie but I'm not sure if there is any nudity, classy. I mean I can read that Ron Silver is in the movie but I don't remember seeing him and you know he had a big role. Explosions occur but outside of the narrative, so that I remember that things explode in this movie but I cant recall why they blow up or what gets blown up, its a real mystery. I don't remember why he has to go back in time anyway, maybe its on accident or maybe on purpose, I don't remember his reason for time travel to be integral to the plot.

    With the exception of "The Terminator" series, the time travel sci-fi story has been on the brink of obscurity Sure there's been movies about time-travel, but not with combined action and awesome effects. I mean "Somewhere in Time" is more like a romance than an action flick and the brilliantly executed "12 Monkeys" doesn't quite qualify as an action flick. Sure Nick Meyer's "Time After Time" was excellent in action but it's a shame that it didn't garner much publicity. And that leaves us with Peter Hyams' 1994 classic "Timecop" which to me goes ways beyond the spectrum of a Jean-Claude van Damme film, but for those action junkies who love the Belgian behemoth it's still all is well. Science-fiction fans be advised: the tight factor of Robert Heinlein's early works like "By His Bootstraps" and "All You Zombies" is very absent. Mr Hyams and his scriptwriting duo of Mark Richardson and Mark Verheiden (who also collaborated with the "Dark Horse" comic this film is adapted from) was loosely taken from Poul Anderson's "Time Patrol" series. Largely due to the plot, a physically legit time traveling is in tact but it's also customized to rewrite the past. And what comes with the package are few antagonists around to foil things for their own evil intentions. Therefore, some time-travel cops join the fray to maintain the real timestream. This is where Van Damme steps into the the thick of things. And in the film he's up against Ron Silver who was in fine form as a Senator who has aspirations to become President determined so much to be in that position that he will break every rule in the book just to get there. In spite of the whole excitement of time-traveling, there are still some issues that remain indecipherable. Like for instance what's the deal with people blowing up whenever they encounter their earlier or later versions of themselves? The whole concept behind that is utterly ridiculous. Sure I wasn't expecting anything logical by far, but still it's never fully explained. But in spite of the irrational implausibilities, if you can get over it in some way, you'll be quite pleased with the craft put into it and and the dramatic factors implemented into the script works out quite subliminally. And even if you don't like Van Damme, who really gives a damn? I think those who have chastised Van Damme over the years have never seen this movie or never seen his previous work when he first started out. Sure he's no James Stewart or anything like that, but he's not as terrible as the mass have panned him out to be.

    In 1994, a bespectacled dude proposes the creation of a covert time travel agency to a committee of senators. He explains the complexities of time travel in a way you have likely never considered. "It turns out if you go back in time and you change something, it's serious! It's like throwing a stone in the water, causing ripples. Only the ripples are in time." Is your mind blown yet? The senator's response, "How much is this gonna cost? The economy is bad right now." Ten years later, we're in the ultra-futuristic era of 2004, where we have smart cars, a prominent "white supremacy party" and the automated voices on answering machines are more sultry and sexy than ever. But not as sexy as Van Damme flexing his ass cheeks on a kitchen counter while he evades a super high-tech tazer gun. Van Damme plays Walker Time Ranger, a mulletman with a broken heart who is tasked with going after self-proclaimed "Harvard visionary" villain McComb. McComb is a time bandit with a penchant for talking to himself. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you won't realize that's a joke. Things go bang, things go boom and a bad guy's arm gets shattered a la T-1000 in Terminator 2. Walker's in a fight against time. And if there's anyone who can kick a clock's ass, you can bet it's Van Damme.

    Time travel is always a neat concept when it comes to movies. It also can be quite confusing. And because there are these too extremes to using this idea, only some people can use it wisely enough and not have the film involve too much time travel. Director Peter Hyams displays that he's one of those people who can handle this kind of situation. From start to finish, I was thoroughly sure I knew where and what was going on. I wasn't confused once. This shows Hyams had control of how much time travel was used in one instance. Timecop is actually a generalization for the people who do the job, but focuses on the story of Max Walker (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a man who belongs to an institution of individuals who police time, based on a popular Dark Horse comic. As stated, time travel was discovered in 1994 and now there are people needed to prevent the past from being altered. One thing I didn't understand was that throughout the entire film, I only saw about two or three timecops. Where's everyone else? However, I only noticed this after the film had ended. I was too busy focusing on what was currently happening on screen. Going back to Van Damme, I was somewhat skeptical about his performance, but in the end, I had much appreciation for it. However, my only complaint is that he reminds me of other actors. His voice sounds a little like Antonio Banderas, his fighting techniques and flexibility, which are impressive, look too much like Jackie Chan's style, and lastly he sports this Peter Weller hair-do as if he were playing Alex Murphy from RoboCop (1987) and not a timecop. I'm not saying this is bad but I was hoping Van Damme would come out as his own actor and not like someone else. Like I said though, Van Damme is cool when he's fighting and he also has some comical moments too. I liked the character of Max Walker, I just thought he'd be somewhat more original and not a knock- off of some other character. Playing the villain, Aaron McComb, is Ron Silver, a corrupt politician who will do anything to make sure he's sitting in the president's chair by the end of the election. Even Silver has some unique moments where he lashes out at characters and then abruptly simmers down. This shows good characterization because it reveals what a loose cannon McComb is and why he's not fit for a president. Mia Sara portrays Max Walker's wife, Melissa Walker. I also think that the two actors made a good couple; too bad it wasn't real. Melissa definitely may not be a physically strong character, but she has a hardy spirit. As the film came to its finale, I had a fondness for her bravery. The special effects are also fair game. There wasn't anything that seemed to be overloaded with CGI and the idea of "matter occupying two spaces at one time" is also another visual treat to see. The part where the film shows how the police go back in time was intriguing as well. It recalled what it was like to first watch Back to the Future (1985), with a speeding vehicle hurtling towards some wall and then suddenly disappearing with track marks ablaze. Mark Isham composed the score to this film. Sadly, I did not feel a whole lot from it but and maybe that's because there was no theme song to it. But it definitely was a soundtrack, because it wasn't noise like Keith Emerson's score from Nighthawks (1981). What a mess that was! Peter Hyams' direction on the Dark Horse comic of a time traveling police officer not only boasts visuals, but also has a great story line. The characters are nicely acted and the action scenes are well played.

    Ever likable Jean-Claude Van Damme high kicks his way through this twisty and interesting futuristic sci-fi action thriller. He plays Max Walker, a cop who becomes part of an elite security force that polices time travel, which has become a reality. As can be expected, there are extremely unscrupulous types who seek nothing more than self gain when it comes to time travel, and typifying this behaviour is rotten, nasty, greedy S.o.B. senator Aaron McComb (Ron Silver, every bit the slick sleaze ball). Some interesting concepts here, and enough opportunity for Van Damme to show off his abilities, although the action is actually in service of the plot for once, the story being based on a comic book series. Director Peter Hyams (who would reunite with Van Damme for the following years' "Sudden Death") often lights scenes in his typical not-particularly-well-lit fashion, but he and a first rate crew still keep this movie racing forward quite effectively. With Van Dammes' character having to deal with a tragedy he would like to prevent, this adds some pathos to his character and allows him the chance to stretch himself more than usual. Silver is perfectly cast as his dapper nemesis, even if the role is pretty one-note and not exactly subtle. Mia Sara, probably best known as the title characters' girlfriend in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", looks lovely and is quite appealing. Gloria Reuben is sexy in a key supporting role, while solid character players like Bruce McGill and Kenneth Welsh have their moments. The story, much like any that deals with the whole idea of time travel, probably wouldn't hold up to much scrutiny, but the movie is a good entertainment that features some very impressive special effects, stunts, and sets, appropriately thuggish henchmen for our bad guy to employ and for our good guy to tussle with, and some highly amusing moments (such as a thug getting his arm frozen and then smashed to bits). Oh, and the viewers are treated to the sight of Van Damme doing the splits to avoid electrocution. Atmospherics are palpable; important scenes take place in the rain so there's often that feel of real gloom. A fun diversion from start to finish. Seven out of 10.

    Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ron Silver, Mia Sara and Bruce McGill star in this 1994 sci-fi film based on the comic book. Max Walker (Van Damme) is a cop who lost his murdered wife, Melissa (Sara) 10 years ago. He's also part of a time-travel program ran by his friend & captain, Eugene Matuzak (McGill). Max learns that a corrupt senator, Aaron McComb (Silver) is using the program to change history so he can make money for his campaign. Max also learns that McComb is responsible for Melissa's death and is now planning to go back and kill him. Max tells Matuzak of McComb's plans to be President and tries to stop him. He also helps Melissa and tries to save her from repeating death. This is a good comic book film and I think it's one of Van Damme's best. Silver was also a great villain as usual and I recommend this.

    Rather Prophetic regarding 2012 for a moovie made in 1994. This Dark Horse Comics movie has Van Damme, using his skills in a character driven role, rather than being a dead guy reanimated or playing against his twin self and beating himself up. I love Van Damme actually, and in this film he gets to act as well as do a few interesting personal injuries to various large thugs. In True Comic Book Fashion, this movie has several scenes of "prequel" - First, they show a scene taking place in the Civil War where a bandit- I think it's Callum Kieth Rennie - steals Confederate Gold. Then in the "present" day a group of senators meet and create an "oversight" committee for a law enforcement unit designed to protect the timeline. Then it's 1929 and the depression is starting, but one guy is doing well- Based on information he brought back from 2004! But then Van Damme shows up, kicks the guys bodyguards asses, and brings him back to the future as they tumble out of a 20th story window. Guy names who sent him back - But will not testify to it - And they return the crook to the same fall Van Damme saved him from, and S P L A T . And then there is a fourth scene which shows JCVD and his wife Mia Sara - This one a little longer than the others, in which he has just gotten a new job as a Timecop, gets called in, Crooks show up and try to kill him but kill his wife, Van Damme sees main crook Ron Silver, and "Then It Blew Up". It is like, we had to read 4 Prequel Comic Books just to get to the beginning of the story. But That is OK by Me, cos I love Comic Books and most of the moovies made from them, even the original Captain American moovie made in the 80's. Peter Hyams does his usual job at directing a well thought out movie, written by the actual guys who made the comics. This was 1994, Jean-Luc Picard Van Damme still looked pretty good, and although by today's standards, the special effects might be labeled "cheesy" - for 1994 they were state of the art, and actually cool. Hyams never stretched beyond what he was able to do, always made good use of available techs. He was able to fake us out in several very Paul Verhooven-ish style violence scenes- Crook getting frozen and then breaking in half, Electrocutions, shootings, disintegrations, etc. The plot follows Van Damme and Bruce McGill (Jack Dalton from MacGuver) through several nightmare permutations of events in time- Until finally Van Damme helps Van Damme. And the ending is your typical "Please God, Make it Never Happened" thing. Seeing how this moovie actually is rated around 7/10 in the IMDb scale, that means it fared well with most people who see it. It's a good moovie, if you like moovies, the locations are great, the LOOK of the movie is interesting, the gadgets do not look like props stolen from Star Trek or purchased at Radio Shack, and there are a few very cool special effects. Plus, it is NON STOP action from practically the beginning. There is always something happening - As opposed to people sitting on couches talking like about 90% of the scenes in Star Wars eps I through III. I loved this moovie when it came out and I love it now. Trying to find it on at least DVD.

    Ron Silver is a great villain, he always is and this movie is maybe the best example of how he can look like a scummy sleaze bag villain without even having to say anything. It is a typical Van Damme movie in many ways with decent fight scenes and a thin unbelievable plot, of course like in most time travel type movies there are a ton of plot holes you could drive a time travelling car through. Van Damme is good and I expected this to be a terrible movie but as far as Van Damme movies go it is probably one of the best and most fun. Not gonna win any awards or anything but definitely a decent way to waste a couple of hours, Ron Silver is amazing.

I think those who have chastised Van Damme over the years have never seen this movie or never seen his previous work when he first started out. Sure he's no James Stewart or anything like that, but he's not as terrible as the mass have panned him out to be.

    In 1994, a bespectacled dude proposes the creation of a covert time travel agency to a committee of senators. He explains the complexities of time travel in a way you have likely never considered. "It turns out if you go back in time and you change something, it's serious! It's like throwing a stone in the water, causing ripples. Only the ripples are in time." Is your mind blown yet? The senator's response, "How much is this gonna cost? The economy is bad right now." Ten years later, we're in the ultra-futuristic era of 2004, where we have smart cars, a prominent "white supremacy party" and the automated voices on answering machines are more sultry and sexy than ever. But not as sexy as Van Damme flexing his ass cheeks on a kitchen counter while he evades a super high-tech tazer gun. Van Damme plays Walker Time Ranger, a mulletman with a broken heart who is tasked with going after self-proclaimed "Harvard visionary" villain McComb. McComb is a time bandit with a penchant for talking to himself. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you won't realize that's a joke. Things go bang, things go boom and a bad guy's arm gets shattered a la T-1000 in Terminator 2. Walker's in a fight against time. And if there's anyone who can kick a clock's ass, you can bet it's Van Damme.

    Time travel is always a neat concept when it comes to movies. It also can be quite confusing. And because there are these too extremes to using this idea, only some people can use it wisely enough and not have the film involve too much time travel. Director Peter Hyams displays that he's one of those people who can handle this kind of situation. From start to finish, I was thoroughly sure I knew where and what was going on. I wasn't confused once. This shows Hyams had control of how much time travel was used in one instance. Timecop is actually a generalization for the people who do the job, but focuses on the story of Max Walker (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a man who belongs to an institution of individuals who police time, based on a popular Dark Horse comic. As stated, time travel was discovered in 1994 and now there are people needed to prevent the past from being altered. One thing I didn't understand was that throughout the entire film, I only saw about two or three timecops. Where's everyone else? However, I only noticed this after the film had ended. I was too busy focusing on what was currently happening on screen. Going back to Van Damme, I was somewhat skeptical about his performance, but in the end, I had much appreciation for it. However, my only complaint is that he reminds me of other actors. His voice sounds a little like Antonio Banderas, his fighting techniques and flexibility, which are impressive, look too much like Jackie Chan's style, and lastly he sports this Peter Weller hair-do as if he were playing Alex Murphy from RoboCop (1987) and not a timecop. I'm not saying this is bad but I was hoping Van Damme would come out as his own actor and not like someone else. Like I said though, Van Damme is cool when he's fighting and he also has some comical moments too. I liked the character of Max Walker, I just thought he'd be somewhat more original and not a knock- off of some other character. Playing the villain, Aaron McComb, is Ron Silver, a corrupt politician who will do anything to make sure he's sitting in the president's chair by the end of the election. Even Silver has some unique moments where he lashes out at characters and then abruptly simmers down. This shows good characterization because it reveals what a loose cannon McComb is and why he's not fit for a president. Mia Sara portrays Max Walker's wife, Melissa Walker. I also think that the two actors made a good couple; too bad it wasn't real. Melissa definitely may not be a physically strong character, but she has a hardy spirit. As the film came to its finale, I had a fondness for her bravery. The special effects are also fair game. There wasn't anything that seemed to be overloaded with CGI and the idea of "matter occupying two spaces at one time" is also another visual treat to see. The part where the film shows how the police go back in time was intriguing as well. It recalled what it was like to first watch Back to the Future (1985), with a speeding vehicle hurtling towards some wall and then suddenly disappearing with track marks ablaze. Mark Isham composed the score to this film. Sadly, I did not feel a whole lot from it but and maybe that's because there was no theme song to it. But it definitely was a soundtrack, because it wasn't noise like Keith Emerson's score from Nighthawks (1981). What a mess that was! Peter Hyams' direction on the Dark Horse comic of a time traveling police officer not only boasts visuals, but also has a great story line. The characters are nicely acted and the action scenes are well played.

    Ever likable Jean-Claude Van Damme high kicks his way through this twisty and interesting futuristic sci-fi action thriller. He plays Max Walker, a cop who becomes part of an elite security force that polices time travel, which has become a reality. As can be expected, there are extremely unscrupulous types who seek nothing more than self gain when it comes to time travel, and typifying this behaviour is rotten, nasty, greedy S.o.B. senator Aaron McComb (Ron Silver, every bit the slick sleaze ball). Some interesting concepts here, and enough opportunity for Van Damme to show off his abilities, although the action is actually in service of the plot for once, the story being based on a comic book series. Director Peter Hyams (who would reunite with Van Damme for the following years' "Sudden Death") often lights scenes in his typical not-particularly-well-lit fashion, but he and a first rate crew still keep this movie racing forward quite effectively. With Van Dammes' character having to deal with a tragedy he would like to prevent, this adds some pathos to his character and allows him the chance to stretch himself more than usual. Silver is perfectly cast as his dapper nemesis, even if the role is pretty one-note and not exactly subtle. Mia Sara, probably best known as the title characters' girlfriend in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", looks lovely and is quite appealing. Gloria Reuben is sexy in a key supporting role, while solid character players like Bruce McGill and Kenneth Welsh have their moments. The story, much like any that deals with the whole idea of time travel, probably wouldn't hold up to much scrutiny, but the movie is a good entertainment that features some very impressive special effects, stunts, and sets, appropriately thuggish henchmen for our bad guy to employ and for our good guy to tussle with, and some highly amusing moments (such as a thug getting his arm frozen and then smashed to bits). Oh, and the viewers are treated to the sight of Van Damme doing the splits to avoid electrocution. Atmospherics are palpable; important scenes take place in the rain so there's often that feel of real gloom. A fun diversion from start to finish. Seven out of 10.

    Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ron Silver, Mia Sara and Bruce McGill star in this 1994 sci-fi film based on the comic book. Max Walker (Van Damme) is a cop who lost his murdered wife, Melissa (Sara) 10 years ago. He's also part of a time-travel program ran by his friend & captain, Eugene Matuzak (McGill). Max learns that a corrupt senator, Aaron McComb (Silver) is using the program to change history so he can make money for his campaign. Max also learns that McComb is responsible for Melissa's death and is now planning to go back and kill him. Max tells Matuzak of McComb's plans to be President and tries to stop him. He also helps Melissa and tries to save her from repeating death. This is a good comic book film and I think it's one of Van Damme's best. Silver was also a great villain as usual and I recommend this.

    Rather Prophetic regarding 2012 for a moovie made in 1994. This Dark Horse Comics movie has Van Damme, using his skills in a character driven role, rather than being a dead guy reanimated or playing against his twin self and beating himself up. I love Van Damme actually, and in this film he gets to act as well as do a few interesting personal injuries to various large thugs. In True Comic Book Fashion, this movie has several scenes of "prequel" - First, they show a scene taking place in the Civil War where a bandit- I think it's Callum Kieth Rennie - steals Confederate Gold. Then in the "present" day a group of senators meet and create an "oversight" committee for a law enforcement unit designed to protect the timeline. Then it's 1929 and the depression is starting, but one guy is doing well- Based on information he brought back from 2004! But then Van Damme shows up, kicks the guys bodyguards asses, and brings him back to the future as they tumble out of a 20th story window. Guy names who sent him back - But will not testify to it - And they return the crook to the same fall Van Damme saved him from, and S P L A T . And then there is a fourth scene which shows JCVD and his wife Mia Sara - This one a little longer than the others, in which he has just gotten a new job as a Timecop, gets called in, Crooks show up and try to kill him but kill his wife, Van Damme sees main crook Ron Silver, and "Then It Blew Up". It is like, we had to read 4 Prequel Comic Books just to get to the beginning of the story. But That is OK by Me, cos I love Comic Books and most of the moovies made from them, even the original Captain American moovie made in the 80's. Peter Hyams does his usual job at directing a well thought out movie, written by the actual guys who made the comics. This was 1994, Jean-Luc Picard Van Damme still looked pretty good, and although by today's standards, the special effects might be labeled "cheesy" - for 1994 they were state of the art, and actually cool. Hyams never stretched beyond what he was able to do, always made good use of available techs. He was able to fake us out in several very Paul Verhooven-ish style violence scenes- Crook getting frozen and then breaking in half, Electrocutions, shootings, disintegrations, etc. The plot follows Van Damme and Bruce McGill (Jack Dalton from MacGuver) through several nightmare permutations of events in time- Until finally Van Damme helps Van Damme. And the ending is your typical "Please God, Make it Never Happened" thing. Seeing how this moovie actually is rated around 7/10 in the IMDb scale, that means it fared well with most people who see it. It's a good moovie, if you like moovies, the locations are great, the LOOK of the movie is interesting, the gadgets do not look like props stolen from Star Trek or purchased at Radio Shack, and there are a few very cool special effects. Plus, it is NON STOP action from practically the beginning. There is always something happening - As opposed to people sitting on couches talking like about 90% of the scenes in Star Wars eps I through III. I loved this moovie when it came out and I love it now. Trying to find it on at least DVD.

    Ron Silver is a great villain, he always is and this movie is maybe the best example of how he can look like a scummy sleaze bag villain without even having to say anything. It is a typical Van Damme movie in many ways with decent fight scenes and a thin unbelievable plot, of course like in most time travel type movies there are a ton of plot holes you could drive a time travelling car through. Van Damme is good and I expected this to be a terrible movie but as far as Van Damme movies go it is probably one of the best and most fun. Not gonna win any awards or anything but definitely a decent way to waste a couple of hours, Ron Silver is amazing.

    Reading through their IMDb pages just now, I noticed that director Peter Hyams and action star Jean-Claude Van Damme will soon collaborate again on a thriller named "Enemies Closer". I think that's particularly good news for Van Damme, as it's my own personal and humble opinion that he accomplished his best films working with Hyams. Seemingly Hyams was the only director who brought a proper balance between demonstrating his martial arts skills and actually giving the opportunity to try and act! "Sudden Death" is a straightforward but extremely competent action flick set in a limited arena ("Die Hard" in a hockey stadium, in fact) and this "Timecop" is a more ambitious and polished Sci-Fi thriller revolving around time traveling. Hyams is more of an expert in the domain of Sci-Fi (with other semi-classic titles on his repertoire such as "Capricorn One", "Outland" and the hate-it-or-love-it cult movie "2010") and that clearly shows during the impressively staged time-catapulting sequences and the overall ease with which the convoluted and paradoxical subject matter is handled. On the other hand, the supposedly hi-tech futuristic gadgets and advanced technology looks incredibly banal and clich&eacute;d in my opinion, like for example the voice-operated cars and televisions in 2004. The plot is actually very similar to that of "Back to the Future, Part II" except  of course  with karate and gunfire instead of DeLoreans. It's all about Van Damme, as Time Enforcement Corps agent Max Walker, traveling back and forth in time to prevent naughty people from meddling with the future before it occurs. The sleazy Senator McComb teleports himself back from 2004 to 1994 to prevent his younger self from making the wrong financial decisions that will cost him the Presidential elections and, during the attempt to stop him, Max Walker discover the exact reasons why his wife got murdered that same year. Although he'll never win any Oscars, I really think Van Damme gives an adequate performance in "Timecop", with a word of thanks to the script and the supportive cast including Mia Sara and Bruce McGill. Best performance comes (as all too often in action movies) from the villain, with Ron Silver depicting a gloriously hateful corrupt politician. It's never made clear what happens to the time-traveling vehicles when arriving in the past. At least the DeLorean in "Back to the Future" always stayed with its passengers.

    This is pretty run-of-the-mill as far as sci-fi goes, and Van-Damme's acting wasn't any better than it was in his other films - contrary to popular opinion - but Peter Hyams' competent direction keeps the thing moving forward at a brisk pace, and Ron Silver makes for a wicked baddie that rivals his work in Blue Steel. If only the action were more exciting. Most of it consists of Walker staying in one position shooting at another guy, and vice-versa until somebody goes down for good. The shootouts lack energy and a sense of life for the most part. The fight scenes are......okay, but nothing that can compete with what I've seen in other actioners from that era. Oh yeah, and what was up with the villain's death scene? That was some frighteningly terrible CGI. I guess they were trying to rival the liquid metal effects in T2 and failed miserably. In fact, the entire finale was way too dark, like pitch black. I remember catching the finale on TV back in the day and noticed it was excessively dark then, too, but Blu-ray doesn't seem to have corrected the problem. Well, flaws aside, this is still one of Van Damme's better films, with some amusing moments here and there.

    I have watched Timecop at least three times, I do not remember much. I have read the synopsis of the movie on the IMDb site and none of it helps. Here is Timecop as best I know- JCVD does the spinning roundhouse kick thing, also there is a mall, i think a lot of the movie is in a mall. A lady is in the movie but I'm not sure if there is any nudity, classy. I mean I can read that Ron Silver is in the movie but I don't remember seeing him and you know he had a big role. Explosions occur but outside of the narrative, so that I remember that things explode in this movie but I cant recall why they blow up or what gets blown up, its a real mystery. I don't remember why he has to go back in time anyway, maybe its on accident or maybe on purpose, I don't remember his reason for time travel to be integral to the plot.

    With the exception of "The Terminator" series, the time travel sci-fi story has been on the brink of obscurity Sure there's been movies about time-travel, but not with combined action and awesome effects. I mean "Somewhere in Time" is more like a romance than an action flick and the brilliantly executed "12 Monkeys" doesn't quite qualify as an action flick. Sure Nick Meyer's "Time After Time" was excellent in action but it's a shame that it didn't garner much publicity. And that leaves us with Peter Hyams' 1994 classic "Timecop" which to me goes ways beyond the spectrum of a Jean-Claude van Damme film, but for those action junkies who love the Belgian behemoth it's still all is well. Science-fiction fans be advised: the tight factor of Robert Heinlein's early works like "By His Bootstraps" and "All You Zombies" is very absent. Mr Hyams and his scriptwriting duo of Mark Richardson and Mark Verheiden (who also collaborated with the "Dark Horse" comic this film is adapted from) was loosely taken from Poul Anderson's "Time Patrol" series. Largely due to the plot, a physically legit time traveling is in tact but it's also customized to rewrite the past. And what comes with the package are few antagonists around to foil things for their own evil intentions. Therefore, some time-travel cops join the fray to maintain the real timestream. This is where Van Damme steps into the the thick of things. And in the film he's up against Ron Silver who was in fine form as a Senator who has aspirations to become President determined so much to be in that position that he will break every rule in the book just to get there. In spite of the whole excitement of time-traveling, there are still some issues that remain indecipherable. Like for instance what's the deal with people blowing up whenever they encounter their earlier or later versions of themselves? The whole concept behind that is utterly ridiculous. Sure I wasn't expecting anything logical by far, but still it's never fully explained. But in spite of the irrational implausibilities, if you can get over it in some way, you'll be quite pleased with the craft put into it and and the dramatic factors implemented into the script works out quite subliminally. And even if you don't like Van Damme, who really gives a damn? I think those who have chastised Van Damme over the years have never seen this movie or never seen his previous work when he first started out. Sure he's no James Stewart or anything like that, but he's not as terrible as the mass have panned him out to be.

This Dark Horse Comics movie has Van Damme, using his skills in a character driven role, rather than being a dead guy reanimated or playing against his twin self and beating himself up. I love Van Damme actually, and in this film he gets to act as well as do a few interesting personal injuries to various large thugs. In True Comic Book Fashion, this movie has several scenes of "prequel" - First, they show a scene taking place in the Civil War where a bandit- I think it's Callum Kieth Rennie - steals Confederate Gold. Then in the "present" day a group of senators meet and create an "oversight" committee for a law enforcement unit designed to protect the timeline. Then it's 1929 and the depression is starting, but one guy is doing well- Based on information he brought back from 2004! But then Van Damme shows up, kicks the guys bodyguards asses, and brings him back to the future as they tumble out of a 20th story window. Guy names who sent him back - But will not testify to it - And they return the crook to the same fall Van Damme saved him from, and S P L A T . And then there is a fourth scene which shows JCVD and his wife Mia Sara - This one a little longer than the others, in which he has just gotten a new job as a Timecop, gets called in, Crooks show up and try to kill him but kill his wife, Van Damme sees main crook Ron Silver, and "Then It Blew Up". It is like, we had to read 4 Prequel Comic Books just to get to the beginning of the story. But That is OK by Me, cos I love Comic Books and most of the moovies made from them, even the original Captain American moovie made in the 80's. Peter Hyams does his usual job at directing a well thought out movie, written by the actual guys who made the comics. This was 1994, Jean-Luc Picard Van Damme still looked pretty good, and although by today's standards, the special effects might be labeled "cheesy" - for 1994 they were state of the art, and actually cool. Hyams never stretched beyond what he was able to do, always made good use of available techs. He was able to fake us out in several very Paul Verhooven-ish style violence scenes- Crook getting frozen and then breaking in half, Electrocutions, shootings, disintegrations, etc. The plot follows Van Damme and Bruce McGill (Jack Dalton from MacGuver) through several nightmare permutations of events in time- Until finally Van Damme helps Van Damme. And the ending is your typical "Please God, Make it Never Happened" thing. Seeing how this moovie actually is rated around 7/10 in the IMDb scale, that means it fared well with most people who see it. It's a good moovie, if you like moovies, the locations are great, the LOOK of the movie is interesting, the gadgets do not look like props stolen from Star Trek or purchased at Radio Shack, and there are a few very cool special effects. Plus, it is NON STOP action from practically the beginning. There is always something happening - As opposed to people sitting on couches talking like about 90% of the scenes in Star Wars eps I through III. I loved this moovie when it came out and I love it now. Trying to find it on at least DVD.

    Ron Silver is a great villain, he always is and this movie is maybe the best example of how he can look like a scummy sleaze bag villain without even having to say anything. It is a typical Van Damme movie in many ways with decent fight scenes and a thin unbelievable plot, of course like in most time travel type movies there are a ton of plot holes you could drive a time travelling car through. Van Damme is good and I expected this to be a terrible movie but as far as Van Damme movies go it is probably one of the best and most fun. Not gonna win any awards or anything but definitely a decent way to waste a couple of hours, Ron Silver is amazing.

    Reading through their IMDb pages just now, I noticed that director Peter Hyams and action star Jean-Claude Van Damme will soon collaborate again on a thriller named "Enemies Closer". I think that's particularly good news for Van Damme, as it's my own personal and humble opinion that he accomplished his best films working with Hyams. Seemingly Hyams was the only director who brought a proper balance between demonstrating his martial arts skills and actually giving the opportunity to try and act! "Sudden Death" is a straightforward but extremely competent action flick set in a limited arena ("Die Hard" in a hockey stadium, in fact) and this "Timecop" is a more ambitious and polished Sci-Fi thriller revolving around time traveling. Hyams is more of an expert in the domain of Sci-Fi (with other semi-classic titles on his repertoire such as "Capricorn One", "Outland" and the hate-it-or-love-it cult movie "2010") and that clearly shows during the impressively staged time-catapulting sequences and the overall ease with which the convoluted and paradoxical subject matter is handled. On the other hand, the supposedly hi-tech futuristic gadgets and advanced technology looks incredibly banal and clich&eacute;d in my opinion, like for example the voice-operated cars and televisions in 2004. The plot is actually very similar to that of "Back to the Future, Part II" except  of course  with karate and gunfire instead of DeLoreans. It's all about Van Damme, as Time Enforcement Corps agent Max Walker, traveling back and forth in time to prevent naughty people from meddling with the future before it occurs. The sleazy Senator McComb teleports himself back from 2004 to 1994 to prevent his younger self from making the wrong financial decisions that will cost him the Presidential elections and, during the attempt to stop him, Max Walker discover the exact reasons why his wife got murdered that same year. Although he'll never win any Oscars, I really think Van Damme gives an adequate performance in "Timecop", with a word of thanks to the script and the supportive cast including Mia Sara and Bruce McGill. Best performance comes (as all too often in action movies) from the villain, with Ron Silver depicting a gloriously hateful corrupt politician. It's never made clear what happens to the time-traveling vehicles when arriving in the past. At least the DeLorean in "Back to the Future" always stayed with its passengers.

    This is pretty run-of-the-mill as far as sci-fi goes, and Van-Damme's acting wasn't any better than it was in his other films - contrary to popular opinion - but Peter Hyams' competent direction keeps the thing moving forward at a brisk pace, and Ron Silver makes for a wicked baddie that rivals his work in Blue Steel. If only the action were more exciting. Most of it consists of Walker staying in one position shooting at another guy, and vice-versa until somebody goes down for good. The shootouts lack energy and a sense of life for the most part. The fight scenes are......okay, but nothing that can compete with what I've seen in other actioners from that era. Oh yeah, and what was up with the villain's death scene? That was some frighteningly terrible CGI. I guess they were trying to rival the liquid metal effects in T2 and failed miserably. In fact, the entire finale was way too dark, like pitch black. I remember catching the finale on TV back in the day and noticed it was excessively dark then, too, but Blu-ray doesn't seem to have corrected the problem. Well, flaws aside, this is still one of Van Damme's better films, with some amusing moments here and there.

    I have watched Timecop at least three times, I do not remember much. I have read the synopsis of the movie on the IMDb site and none of it helps. Here is Timecop as best I know- JCVD does the spinning roundhouse kick thing, also there is a mall, i think a lot of the movie is in a mall. A lady is in the movie but I'm not sure if there is any nudity, classy. I mean I can read that Ron Silver is in the movie but I don't remember seeing him and you know he had a big role. Explosions occur but outside of the narrative, so that I remember that things explode in this movie but I cant recall why they blow up or what gets blown up, its a real mystery. I don't remember why he has to go back in time anyway, maybe its on accident or maybe on purpose, I don't remember his reason for time travel to be integral to the plot.

    With the exception of "The Terminator" series, the time travel sci-fi story has been on the brink of obscurity Sure there's been movies about time-travel, but not with combined action and awesome effects. I mean "Somewhere in Time" is more like a romance than an action flick and the brilliantly executed "12 Monkeys" doesn't quite qualify as an action flick. Sure Nick Meyer's "Time After Time" was excellent in action but it's a shame that it didn't garner much publicity. And that leaves us with Peter Hyams' 1994 classic "Timecop" which to me goes ways beyond the spectrum of a Jean-Claude van Damme film, but for those action junkies who love the Belgian behemoth it's still all is well. Science-fiction fans be advised: the tight factor of Robert Heinlein's early works like "By His Bootstraps" and "All You Zombies" is very absent. Mr Hyams and his scriptwriting duo of Mark Richardson and Mark Verheiden (who also collaborated with the "Dark Horse" comic this film is adapted from) was loosely taken from Poul Anderson's "Time Patrol" series. Largely due to the plot, a physically legit time traveling is in tact but it's also customized to rewrite the past. And what comes with the package are few antagonists around to foil things for their own evil intentions. Therefore, some time-travel cops join the fray to maintain the real timestream. This is where Van Damme steps into the the thick of things. And in the film he's up against Ron Silver who was in fine form as a Senator who has aspirations to become President determined so much to be in that position that he will break every rule in the book just to get there. In spite of the whole excitement of time-traveling, there are still some issues that remain indecipherable. Like for instance what's the deal with people blowing up whenever they encounter their earlier or later versions of themselves? The whole concept behind that is utterly ridiculous. Sure I wasn't expecting anything logical by far, but still it's never fully explained. But in spite of the irrational implausibilities, if you can get over it in some way, you'll be quite pleased with the craft put into it and and the dramatic factors implemented into the script works out quite subliminally. And even if you don't like Van Damme, who really gives a damn? I think those who have chastised Van Damme over the years have never seen this movie or never seen his previous work when he first started out. Sure he's no James Stewart or anything like that, but he's not as terrible as the mass have panned him out to be.

    In 1994, a bespectacled dude proposes the creation of a covert time travel agency to a committee of senators. He explains the complexities of time travel in a way you have likely never considered. "It turns out if you go back in time and you change something, it's serious! It's like throwing a stone in the water, causing ripples. Only the ripples are in time." Is your mind blown yet? The senator's response, "How much is this gonna cost? The economy is bad right now." Ten years later, we're in the ultra-futuristic era of 2004, where we have smart cars, a prominent "white supremacy party" and the automated voices on answering machines are more sultry and sexy than ever. But not as sexy as Van Damme flexing his ass cheeks on a kitchen counter while he evades a super high-tech tazer gun. Van Damme plays Walker Time Ranger, a mulletman with a broken heart who is tasked with going after self-proclaimed "Harvard visionary" villain McComb. McComb is a time bandit with a penchant for talking to himself. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you won't realize that's a joke. Things go bang, things go boom and a bad guy's arm gets shattered a la T-1000 in Terminator 2. Walker's in a fight against time. And if there's anyone who can kick a clock's ass, you can bet it's Van Damme.

    Time travel is always a neat concept when it comes to movies. It also can be quite confusing. And because there are these too extremes to using this idea, only some people can use it wisely enough and not have the film involve too much time travel. Director Peter Hyams displays that he's one of those people who can handle this kind of situation. From start to finish, I was thoroughly sure I knew where and what was going on. I wasn't confused once. This shows Hyams had control of how much time travel was used in one instance. Timecop is actually a generalization for the people who do the job, but focuses on the story of Max Walker (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a man who belongs to an institution of individuals who police time, based on a popular Dark Horse comic. As stated, time travel was discovered in 1994 and now there are people needed to prevent the past from being altered. One thing I didn't understand was that throughout the entire film, I only saw about two or three timecops. Where's everyone else? However, I only noticed this after the film had ended. I was too busy focusing on what was currently happening on screen. Going back to Van Damme, I was somewhat skeptical about his performance, but in the end, I had much appreciation for it. However, my only complaint is that he reminds me of other actors. His voice sounds a little like Antonio Banderas, his fighting techniques and flexibility, which are impressive, look too much like Jackie Chan's style, and lastly he sports this Peter Weller hair-do as if he were playing Alex Murphy from RoboCop (1987) and not a timecop. I'm not saying this is bad but I was hoping Van Damme would come out as his own actor and not like someone else. Like I said though, Van Damme is cool when he's fighting and he also has some comical moments too. I liked the character of Max Walker, I just thought he'd be somewhat more original and not a knock- off of some other character. Playing the villain, Aaron McComb, is Ron Silver, a corrupt politician who will do anything to make sure he's sitting in the president's chair by the end of the election. Even Silver has some unique moments where he lashes out at characters and then abruptly simmers down. This shows good characterization because it reveals what a loose cannon McComb is and why he's not fit for a president. Mia Sara portrays Max Walker's wife, Melissa Walker. I also think that the two actors made a good couple; too bad it wasn't real. Melissa definitely may not be a physically strong character, but she has a hardy spirit. As the film came to its finale, I had a fondness for her bravery. The special effects are also fair game. There wasn't anything that seemed to be overloaded with CGI and the idea of "matter occupying two spaces at one time" is also another visual treat to see. The part where the film shows how the police go back in time was intriguing as well. It recalled what it was like to first watch Back to the Future (1985), with a speeding vehicle hurtling towards some wall and then suddenly disappearing with track marks ablaze. Mark Isham composed the score to this film. Sadly, I did not feel a whole lot from it but and maybe that's because there was no theme song to it. But it definitely was a soundtrack, because it wasn't noise like Keith Emerson's score from Nighthawks (1981). What a mess that was! Peter Hyams' direction on the Dark Horse comic of a time traveling police officer not only boasts visuals, but also has a great story line. The characters are nicely acted and the action scenes are well played.

    Ever likable Jean-Claude Van Damme high kicks his way through this twisty and interesting futuristic sci-fi action thriller. He plays Max Walker, a cop who becomes part of an elite security force that polices time travel, which has become a reality. As can be expected, there are extremely unscrupulous types who seek nothing more than self gain when it comes to time travel, and typifying this behaviour is rotten, nasty, greedy S.o.B. senator Aaron McComb (Ron Silver, every bit the slick sleaze ball). Some interesting concepts here, and enough opportunity for Van Damme to show off his abilities, although the action is actually in service of the plot for once, the story being based on a comic book series. Director Peter Hyams (who would reunite with Van Damme for the following years' "Sudden Death") often lights scenes in his typical not-particularly-well-lit fashion, but he and a first rate crew still keep this movie racing forward quite effectively. With Van Dammes' character having to deal with a tragedy he would like to prevent, this adds some pathos to his character and allows him the chance to stretch himself more than usual. Silver is perfectly cast as his dapper nemesis, even if the role is pretty one-note and not exactly subtle. Mia Sara, probably best known as the title characters' girlfriend in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", looks lovely and is quite appealing. Gloria Reuben is sexy in a key supporting role, while solid character players like Bruce McGill and Kenneth Welsh have their moments. The story, much like any that deals with the whole idea of time travel, probably wouldn't hold up to much scrutiny, but the movie is a good entertainment that features some very impressive special effects, stunts, and sets, appropriately thuggish henchmen for our bad guy to employ and for our good guy to tussle with, and some highly amusing moments (such as a thug getting his arm frozen and then smashed to bits). Oh, and the viewers are treated to the sight of Van Damme doing the splits to avoid electrocution. Atmospherics are palpable; important scenes take place in the rain so there's often that feel of real gloom. A fun diversion from start to finish. Seven out of 10.

    Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ron Silver, Mia Sara and Bruce McGill star in this 1994 sci-fi film based on the comic book. Max Walker (Van Damme) is a cop who lost his murdered wife, Melissa (Sara) 10 years ago. He's also part of a time-travel program ran by his friend & captain, Eugene Matuzak (McGill). Max learns that a corrupt senator, Aaron McComb (Silver) is using the program to change history so he can make money for his campaign. Max also learns that McComb is responsible for Melissa's death and is now planning to go back and kill him. Max tells Matuzak of McComb's plans to be President and tries to stop him. He also helps Melissa and tries to save her from repeating death. This is a good comic book film and I think it's one of Van Damme's best. Silver was also a great villain as usual and I recommend this.

Sure Nick Meyer's "Time After Time" was excellent in action but it's a shame that it didn't garner much publicity. And that leaves us with Peter Hyams' 1994 classic "Timecop" which to me goes ways beyond the spectrum of a Jean-Claude van Damme film, but for those action junkies who love the Belgian behemoth it's still all is well. Science-fiction fans be advised: the tight factor of Robert Heinlein's early works like "By His Bootstraps" and "All You Zombies" is very absent. Mr Hyams and his scriptwriting duo of Mark Richardson and Mark Verheiden (who also collaborated with the "Dark Horse" comic this film is adapted from) was loosely taken from Poul Anderson's "Time Patrol" series. Largely due to the plot, a physically legit time traveling is in tact but it's also customized to rewrite the past. And what comes with the package are few antagonists around to foil things for their own evil intentions. Therefore, some time-travel cops join the fray to maintain the real timestream. This is where Van Damme steps into the the thick of things. And in the film he's up against Ron Silver who was in fine form as a Senator who has aspirations to become President determined so much to be in that position that he will break every rule in the book just to get there. In spite of the whole excitement of time-traveling, there are still some issues that remain indecipherable. Like for instance what's the deal with people blowing up whenever they encounter their earlier or later versions of themselves? The whole concept behind that is utterly ridiculous. Sure I wasn't expecting anything logical by far, but still it's never fully explained. But in spite of the irrational implausibilities, if you can get over it in some way, you'll be quite pleased with the craft put into it and and the dramatic factors implemented into the script works out quite subliminally. And even if you don't like Van Damme, who really gives a damn? I think those who have chastised Van Damme over the years have never seen this movie or never seen his previous work when he first started out. Sure he's no James Stewart or anything like that, but he's not as terrible as the mass have panned him out to be.

    In 1994, a bespectacled dude proposes the creation of a covert time travel agency to a committee of senators. He explains the complexities of time travel in a way you have likely never considered. "It turns out if you go back in time and you change something, it's serious! It's like throwing a stone in the water, causing ripples. Only the ripples are in time." Is your mind blown yet? The senator's response, "How much is this gonna cost? The economy is bad right now." Ten years later, we're in the ultra-futuristic era of 2004, where we have smart cars, a prominent "white supremacy party" and the automated voices on answering machines are more sultry and sexy than ever. But not as sexy as Van Damme flexing his ass cheeks on a kitchen counter while he evades a super high-tech tazer gun. Van Damme plays Walker Time Ranger, a mulletman with a broken heart who is tasked with going after self-proclaimed "Harvard visionary" villain McComb. McComb is a time bandit with a penchant for talking to himself. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you won't realize that's a joke. Things go bang, things go boom and a bad guy's arm gets shattered a la T-1000 in Terminator 2. Walker's in a fight against time. And if there's anyone who can kick a clock's ass, you can bet it's Van Damme.

    Time travel is always a neat concept when it comes to movies. It also can be quite confusing. And because there are these too extremes to using this idea, only some people can use it wisely enough and not have the film involve too much time travel. Director Peter Hyams displays that he's one of those people who can handle this kind of situation. From start to finish, I was thoroughly sure I knew where and what was going on. I wasn't confused once. This shows Hyams had control of how much time travel was used in one instance. Timecop is actually a generalization for the people who do the job, but focuses on the story of Max Walker (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a man who belongs to an institution of individuals who police time, based on a popular Dark Horse comic. As stated, time travel was discovered in 1994 and now there are people needed to prevent the past from being altered. One thing I didn't understand was that throughout the entire film, I only saw about two or three timecops. Where's everyone else? However, I only noticed this after the film had ended. I was too busy focusing on what was currently happening on screen. Going back to Van Damme, I was somewhat skeptical about his performance, but in the end, I had much appreciation for it. However, my only complaint is that he reminds me of other actors. His voice sounds a little like Antonio Banderas, his fighting techniques and flexibility, which are impressive, look too much like Jackie Chan's style, and lastly he sports this Peter Weller hair-do as if he were playing Alex Murphy from RoboCop (1987) and not a timecop. I'm not saying this is bad but I was hoping Van Damme would come out as his own actor and not like someone else. Like I said though, Van Damme is cool when he's fighting and he also has some comical moments too. I liked the character of Max Walker, I just thought he'd be somewhat more original and not a knock- off of some other character. Playing the villain, Aaron McComb, is Ron Silver, a corrupt politician who will do anything to make sure he's sitting in the president's chair by the end of the election. Even Silver has some unique moments where he lashes out at characters and then abruptly simmers down. This shows good characterization because it reveals what a loose cannon McComb is and why he's not fit for a president. Mia Sara portrays Max Walker's wife, Melissa Walker. I also think that the two actors made a good couple; too bad it wasn't real. Melissa definitely may not be a physically strong character, but she has a hardy spirit. As the film came to its finale, I had a fondness for her bravery. The special effects are also fair game. There wasn't anything that seemed to be overloaded with CGI and the idea of "matter occupying two spaces at one time" is also another visual treat to see. The part where the film shows how the police go back in time was intriguing as well. It recalled what it was like to first watch Back to the Future (1985), with a speeding vehicle hurtling towards some wall and then suddenly disappearing with track marks ablaze. Mark Isham composed the score to this film. Sadly, I did not feel a whole lot from it but and maybe that's because there was no theme song to it. But it definitely was a soundtrack, because it wasn't noise like Keith Emerson's score from Nighthawks (1981). What a mess that was! Peter Hyams' direction on the Dark Horse comic of a time traveling police officer not only boasts visuals, but also has a great story line. The characters are nicely acted and the action scenes are well played.

    Ever likable Jean-Claude Van Damme high kicks his way through this twisty and interesting futuristic sci-fi action thriller. He plays Max Walker, a cop who becomes part of an elite security force that polices time travel, which has become a reality. As can be expected, there are extremely unscrupulous types who seek nothing more than self gain when it comes to time travel, and typifying this behaviour is rotten, nasty, greedy S.o.B. senator Aaron McComb (Ron Silver, every bit the slick sleaze ball). Some interesting concepts here, and enough opportunity for Van Damme to show off his abilities, although the action is actually in service of the plot for once, the story being based on a comic book series. Director Peter Hyams (who would reunite with Van Damme for the following years' "Sudden Death") often lights scenes in his typical not-particularly-well-lit fashion, but he and a first rate crew still keep this movie racing forward quite effectively. With Van Dammes' character having to deal with a tragedy he would like to prevent, this adds some pathos to his character and allows him the chance to stretch himself more than usual. Silver is perfectly cast as his dapper nemesis, even if the role is pretty one-note and not exactly subtle. Mia Sara, probably best known as the title characters' girlfriend in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", looks lovely and is quite appealing. Gloria Reuben is sexy in a key supporting role, while solid character players like Bruce McGill and Kenneth Welsh have their moments. The story, much like any that deals with the whole idea of time travel, probably wouldn't hold up to much scrutiny, but the movie is a good entertainment that features some very impressive special effects, stunts, and sets, appropriately thuggish henchmen for our bad guy to employ and for our good guy to tussle with, and some highly amusing moments (such as a thug getting his arm frozen and then smashed to bits). Oh, and the viewers are treated to the sight of Van Damme doing the splits to avoid electrocution. Atmospherics are palpable; important scenes take place in the rain so there's often that feel of real gloom. A fun diversion from start to finish. Seven out of 10.

    Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ron Silver, Mia Sara and Bruce McGill star in this 1994 sci-fi film based on the comic book. Max Walker (Van Damme) is a cop who lost his murdered wife, Melissa (Sara) 10 years ago. He's also part of a time-travel program ran by his friend & captain, Eugene Matuzak (McGill). Max learns that a corrupt senator, Aaron McComb (Silver) is using the program to change history so he can make money for his campaign. Max also learns that McComb is responsible for Melissa's death and is now planning to go back and kill him. Max tells Matuzak of McComb's plans to be President and tries to stop him. He also helps Melissa and tries to save her from repeating death. This is a good comic book film and I think it's one of Van Damme's best. Silver was also a great villain as usual and I recommend this.

    Rather Prophetic regarding 2012 for a moovie made in 1994. This Dark Horse Comics movie has Van Damme, using his skills in a character driven role, rather than being a dead guy reanimated or playing against his twin self and beating himself up. I love Van Damme actually, and in this film he gets to act as well as do a few interesting personal injuries to various large thugs. In True Comic Book Fashion, this movie has several scenes of "prequel" - First, they show a scene taking place in the Civil War where a bandit- I think it's Callum Kieth Rennie - steals Confederate Gold. Then in the "present" day a group of senators meet and create an "oversight" committee for a law enforcement unit designed to protect the timeline. Then it's 1929 and the depression is starting, but one guy is doing well- Based on information he brought back from 2004! But then Van Damme shows up, kicks the guys bodyguards asses, and brings him back to the future as they tumble out of a 20th story window. Guy names who sent him back - But will not testify to it - And they return the crook to the same fall Van Damme saved him from, and S P L A T . And then there is a fourth scene which shows JCVD and his wife Mia Sara - This one a little longer than the others, in which he has just gotten a new job as a Timecop, gets called in, Crooks show up and try to kill him but kill his wife, Van Damme sees main crook Ron Silver, and "Then It Blew Up". It is like, we had to read 4 Prequel Comic Books just to get to the beginning of the story. But That is OK by Me, cos I love Comic Books and most of the moovies made from them, even the original Captain American moovie made in the 80's. Peter Hyams does his usual job at directing a well thought out movie, written by the actual guys who made the comics. This was 1994, Jean-Luc Picard Van Damme still looked pretty good, and although by today's standards, the special effects might be labeled "cheesy" - for 1994 they were state of the art, and actually cool. Hyams never stretched beyond what he was able to do, always made good use of available techs. He was able to fake us out in several very Paul Verhooven-ish style violence scenes- Crook getting frozen and then breaking in half, Electrocutions, shootings, disintegrations, etc. The plot follows Van Damme and Bruce McGill (Jack Dalton from MacGuver) through several nightmare permutations of events in time- Until finally Van Damme helps Van Damme. And the ending is your typical "Please God, Make it Never Happened" thing. Seeing how this moovie actually is rated around 7/10 in the IMDb scale, that means it fared well with most people who see it. It's a good moovie, if you like moovies, the locations are great, the LOOK of the movie is interesting, the gadgets do not look like props stolen from Star Trek or purchased at Radio Shack, and there are a few very cool special effects. Plus, it is NON STOP action from practically the beginning. There is always something happening - As opposed to people sitting on couches talking like about 90% of the scenes in Star Wars eps I through III. I loved this moovie when it came out and I love it now. Trying to find it on at least DVD.

    Ron Silver is a great villain, he always is and this movie is maybe the best example of how he can look like a scummy sleaze bag villain without even having to say anything. It is a typical Van Damme movie in many ways with decent fight scenes and a thin unbelievable plot, of course like in most time travel type movies there are a ton of plot holes you could drive a time travelling car through. Van Damme is good and I expected this to be a terrible movie but as far as Van Damme movies go it is probably one of the best and most fun. Not gonna win any awards or anything but definitely a decent way to waste a couple of hours, Ron Silver is amazing.

    Reading through their IMDb pages just now, I noticed that director Peter Hyams and action star Jean-Claude Van Damme will soon collaborate again on a thriller named "Enemies Closer". I think that's particularly good news for Van Damme, as it's my own personal and humble opinion that he accomplished his best films working with Hyams. Seemingly Hyams was the only director who brought a proper balance between demonstrating his martial arts skills and actually giving the opportunity to try and act! "Sudden Death" is a straightforward but extremely competent action flick set in a limited arena ("Die Hard" in a hockey stadium, in fact) and this "Timecop" is a more ambitious and polished Sci-Fi thriller revolving around time traveling. Hyams is more of an expert in the domain of Sci-Fi (with other semi-classic titles on his repertoire such as "Capricorn One", "Outland" and the hate-it-or-love-it cult movie "2010") and that clearly shows during the impressively staged time-catapulting sequences and the overall ease with which the convoluted and paradoxical subject matter is handled. On the other hand, the supposedly hi-tech futuristic gadgets and advanced technology looks incredibly banal and clich&eacute;d in my opinion, like for example the voice-operated cars and televisions in 2004. The plot is actually very similar to that of "Back to the Future, Part II" except  of course  with karate and gunfire instead of DeLoreans. It's all about Van Damme, as Time Enforcement Corps agent Max Walker, traveling back and forth in time to prevent naughty people from meddling with the future before it occurs. The sleazy Senator McComb teleports himself back from 2004 to 1994 to prevent his younger self from making the wrong financial decisions that will cost him the Presidential elections and, during the attempt to stop him, Max Walker discover the exact reasons why his wife got murdered that same year. Although he'll never win any Oscars, I really think Van Damme gives an adequate performance in "Timecop", with a word of thanks to the script and the supportive cast including Mia Sara and Bruce McGill. Best performance comes (as all too often in action movies) from the villain, with Ron Silver depicting a gloriously hateful corrupt politician. It's never made clear what happens to the time-traveling vehicles when arriving in the past. At least the DeLorean in "Back to the Future" always stayed with its passengers.

    This is pretty run-of-the-mill as far as sci-fi goes, and Van-Damme's acting wasn't any better than it was in his other films - contrary to popular opinion - but Peter Hyams' competent direction keeps the thing moving forward at a brisk pace, and Ron Silver makes for a wicked baddie that rivals his work in Blue Steel. If only the action were more exciting. Most of it consists of Walker staying in one position shooting at another guy, and vice-versa until somebody goes down for good. The shootouts lack energy and a sense of life for the most part. The fight scenes are......okay, but nothing that can compete with what I've seen in other actioners from that era. Oh yeah, and what was up with the villain's death scene? That was some frighteningly terrible CGI. I guess they were trying to rival the liquid metal effects in T2 and failed miserably. In fact, the entire finale was way too dark, like pitch black. I remember catching the finale on TV back in the day and noticed it was excessively dark then, too, but Blu-ray doesn't seem to have corrected the problem. Well, flaws aside, this is still one of Van Damme's better films, with some amusing moments here and there.

    I have watched Timecop at least three times, I do not remember much. I have read the synopsis of the movie on the IMDb site and none of it helps. Here is Timecop as best I know- JCVD does the spinning roundhouse kick thing, also there is a mall, i think a lot of the movie is in a mall. A lady is in the movie but I'm not sure if there is any nudity, classy. I mean I can read that Ron Silver is in the movie but I don't remember seeing him and you know he had a big role. Explosions occur but outside of the narrative, so that I remember that things explode in this movie but I cant recall why they blow up or what gets blown up, its a real mystery. I don't remember why he has to go back in time anyway, maybe its on accident or maybe on purpose, I don't remember his reason for time travel to be integral to the plot.

    Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ron Silver, Mia Sara and Bruce McGill star in this 1994 sci-fi film based on the comic book. Max Walker (Van Damme) is a cop who lost his murdered wife, Melissa (Sara) 10 years ago. He's also part of a time-travel program ran by his friend & captain, Eugene Matuzak (McGill). Max learns that a corrupt senator, Aaron McComb (Silver) is using the program to change history so he can make money for his campaign. Max also learns that McComb is responsible for Melissa's death and is now planning to go back and kill him. Max tells Matuzak of McComb's plans to be President and tries to stop him. He also helps Melissa and tries to save her from repeating death. This is a good comic book film and I think it's one of Van Damme's best. Silver was also a great villain as usual and I recommend this.

    Rather Prophetic regarding 2012 for a moovie made in 1994. This Dark Horse Comics movie has Van Damme, using his skills in a character driven role, rather than being a dead guy reanimated or playing against his twin self and beating himself up. I love Van Damme actually, and in this film he gets to act as well as do a few interesting personal injuries to various large thugs. In True Comic Book Fashion, this movie has several scenes of "prequel" - First, they show a scene taking place in the Civil War where a bandit- I think it's Callum Kieth Rennie - steals Confederate Gold. Then in the "present" day a group of senators meet and create an "oversight" committee for a law enforcement unit designed to protect the timeline. Then it's 1929 and the depression is starting, but one guy is doing well- Based on information he brought back from 2004! But then Van Damme shows up, kicks the guys bodyguards asses, and brings him back to the future as they tumble out of a 20th story window. Guy names who sent him back - But will not testify to it - And they return the crook to the same fall Van Damme saved him from, and S P L A T . And then there is a fourth scene which shows JCVD and his wife Mia Sara - This one a little longer than the others, in which he has just gotten a new job as a Timecop, gets called in, Crooks show up and try to kill him but kill his wife, Van Damme sees main crook Ron Silver, and "Then It Blew Up". It is like, we had to read 4 Prequel Comic Books just to get to the beginning of the story. But That is OK by Me, cos I love Comic Books and most of the moovies made from them, even the original Captain American moovie made in the 80's. Peter Hyams does his usual job at directing a well thought out movie, written by the actual guys who made the comics. This was 1994, Jean-Luc Picard Van Damme still looked pretty good, and although by today's standards, the special effects might be labeled "cheesy" - for 1994 they were state of the art, and actually cool. Hyams never stretched beyond what he was able to do, always made good use of available techs. He was able to fake us out in several very Paul Verhooven-ish style violence scenes- Crook getting frozen and then breaking in half, Electrocutions, shootings, disintegrations, etc. The plot follows Van Damme and Bruce McGill (Jack Dalton from MacGuver) through several nightmare permutations of events in time- Until finally Van Damme helps Van Damme. And the ending is your typical "Please God, Make it Never Happened" thing. Seeing how this moovie actually is rated around 7/10 in the IMDb scale, that means it fared well with most people who see it. It's a good moovie, if you like moovies, the locations are great, the LOOK of the movie is interesting, the gadgets do not look like props stolen from Star Trek or purchased at Radio Shack, and there are a few very cool special effects. Plus, it is NON STOP action from practically the beginning. There is always something happening - As opposed to people sitting on couches talking like about 90% of the scenes in Star Wars eps I through III. I loved this moovie when it came out and I love it now. Trying to find it on at least DVD.

    Ron Silver is a great villain, he always is and this movie is maybe the best example of how he can look like a scummy sleaze bag villain without even having to say anything. It is a typical Van Damme movie in many ways with decent fight scenes and a thin unbelievable plot, of course like in most time travel type movies there are a ton of plot holes you could drive a time travelling car through. Van Damme is good and I expected this to be a terrible movie but as far as Van Damme movies go it is probably one of the best and most fun. Not gonna win any awards or anything but definitely a decent way to waste a couple of hours, Ron Silver is amazing.

    Reading through their IMDb pages just now, I noticed that director Peter Hyams and action star Jean-Claude Van Damme will soon collaborate again on a thriller named "Enemies Closer". I think that's particularly good news for Van Damme, as it's my own personal and humble opinion that he accomplished his best films working with Hyams. Seemingly Hyams was the only director who brought a proper balance between demonstrating his martial arts skills and actually giving the opportunity to try and act! "Sudden Death" is a straightforward but extremely competent action flick set in a limited arena ("Die Hard" in a hockey stadium, in fact) and this "Timecop" is a more ambitious and polished Sci-Fi thriller revolving around time traveling. Hyams is more of an expert in the domain of Sci-Fi (with other semi-classic titles on his repertoire such as "Capricorn One", "Outland" and the hate-it-or-love-it cult movie "2010") and that clearly shows during the impressively staged time-catapulting sequences and the overall ease with which the convoluted and paradoxical subject matter is handled. On the other hand, the supposedly hi-tech futuristic gadgets and advanced technology looks incredibly banal and clich&eacute;d in my opinion, like for example the voice-operated cars and televisions in 2004. The plot is actually very similar to that of "Back to the Future, Part II" except  of course  with karate and gunfire instead of DeLoreans. It's all about Van Damme, as Time Enforcement Corps agent Max Walker, traveling back and forth in time to prevent naughty people from meddling with the future before it occurs. The sleazy Senator McComb teleports himself back from 2004 to 1994 to prevent his younger self from making the wrong financial decisions that will cost him the Presidential elections and, during the attempt to stop him, Max Walker discover the exact reasons why his wife got murdered that same year. Although he'll never win any Oscars, I really think Van Damme gives an adequate performance in "Timecop", with a word of thanks to the script and the supportive cast including Mia Sara and Bruce McGill. Best performance comes (as all too often in action movies) from the villain, with Ron Silver depicting a gloriously hateful corrupt politician. It's never made clear what happens to the time-traveling vehicles when arriving in the past. At least the DeLorean in "Back to the Future" always stayed with its passengers.

    This is pretty run-of-the-mill as far as sci-fi goes, and Van-Damme's acting wasn't any better than it was in his other films - contrary to popular opinion - but Peter Hyams' competent direction keeps the thing moving forward at a brisk pace, and Ron Silver makes for a wicked baddie that rivals his work in Blue Steel. If only the action were more exciting. Most of it consists of Walker staying in one position shooting at another guy, and vice-versa until somebody goes down for good. The shootouts lack energy and a sense of life for the most part. The fight scenes are......okay, but nothing that can compete with what I've seen in other actioners from that era. Oh yeah, and what was up with the villain's death scene? That was some frighteningly terrible CGI. I guess they were trying to rival the liquid metal effects in T2 and failed miserably. In fact, the entire finale was way too dark, like pitch black. I remember catching the finale on TV back in the day and noticed it was excessively dark then, too, but Blu-ray doesn't seem to have corrected the problem. Well, flaws aside, this is still one of Van Damme's better films, with some amusing moments here and there.

    I have watched Timecop at least three times, I do not remember much. I have read the synopsis of the movie on the IMDb site and none of it helps. Here is Timecop as best I know- JCVD does the spinning roundhouse kick thing, also there is a mall, i think a lot of the movie is in a mall. A lady is in the movie but I'm not sure if there is any nudity, classy. I mean I can read that Ron Silver is in the movie but I don't remember seeing him and you know he had a big role. Explosions occur but outside of the narrative, so that I remember that things explode in this movie but I cant recall why they blow up or what gets blown up, its a real mystery. I don't remember why he has to go back in time anyway, maybe its on accident or maybe on purpose, I don't remember his reason for time travel to be integral to the plot.

    With the exception of "The Terminator" series, the time travel sci-fi story has been on the brink of obscurity Sure there's been movies about time-travel, but not with combined action and awesome effects. I mean "Somewhere in Time" is more like a romance than an action flick and the brilliantly executed "12 Monkeys" doesn't quite qualify as an action flick. Sure Nick Meyer's "Time After Time" was excellent in action but it's a shame that it didn't garner much publicity. And that leaves us with Peter Hyams' 1994 classic "Timecop" which to me goes ways beyond the spectrum of a Jean-Claude van Damme film, but for those action junkies who love the Belgian behemoth it's still all is well. Science-fiction fans be advised: the tight factor of Robert Heinlein's early works like "By His Bootstraps" and "All You Zombies" is very absent. Mr Hyams and his scriptwriting duo of Mark Richardson and Mark Verheiden (who also collaborated with the "Dark Horse" comic this film is adapted from) was loosely taken from Poul Anderson's "Time Patrol" series. Largely due to the plot, a physically legit time traveling is in tact but it's also customized to rewrite the past. And what comes with the package are few antagonists around to foil things for their own evil intentions. Therefore, some time-travel cops join the fray to maintain the real timestream. This is where Van Damme steps into the the thick of things. And in the film he's up against Ron Silver who was in fine form as a Senator who has aspirations to become President determined so much to be in that position that he will break every rule in the book just to get there. In spite of the whole excitement of time-traveling, there are still some issues that remain indecipherable. Like for instance what's the deal with people blowing up whenever they encounter their earlier or later versions of themselves? The whole concept behind that is utterly ridiculous. Sure I wasn't expecting anything logical by far, but still it's never fully explained. But in spite of the irrational implausibilities, if you can get over it in some way, you'll be quite pleased with the craft put into it and and the dramatic factors implemented into the script works out quite subliminally. And even if you don't like Van Damme, who really gives a damn? I think those who have chastised Van Damme over the years have never seen this movie or never seen his previous work when he first started out. Sure he's no James Stewart or anything like that, but he's not as terrible as the mass have panned him out to be.

    In 1994, a bespectacled dude proposes the creation of a covert time travel agency to a committee of senators. He explains the complexities of time travel in a way you have likely never considered. "It turns out if you go back in time and you change something, it's serious! It's like throwing a stone in the water, causing ripples. Only the ripples are in time." Is your mind blown yet? The senator's response, "How much is this gonna cost? The economy is bad right now." Ten years later, we're in the ultra-futuristic era of 2004, where we have smart cars, a prominent "white supremacy party" and the automated voices on answering machines are more sultry and sexy than ever. But not as sexy as Van Damme flexing his ass cheeks on a kitchen counter while he evades a super high-tech tazer gun. Van Damme plays Walker Time Ranger, a mulletman with a broken heart who is tasked with going after self-proclaimed "Harvard visionary" villain McComb. McComb is a time bandit with a penchant for talking to himself. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you won't realize that's a joke. Things go bang, things go boom and a bad guy's arm gets shattered a la T-1000 in Terminator 2. Walker's in a fight against time. And if there's anyone who can kick a clock's ass, you can bet it's Van Damme.

    Time travel is always a neat concept when it comes to movies. It also can be quite confusing. And because there are these too extremes to using this idea, only some people can use it wisely enough and not have the film involve too much time travel. Director Peter Hyams displays that he's one of those people who can handle this kind of situation. From start to finish, I was thoroughly sure I knew where and what was going on. I wasn't confused once. This shows Hyams had control of how much time travel was used in one instance. Timecop is actually a generalization for the people who do the job, but focuses on the story of Max Walker (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a man who belongs to an institution of individuals who police time, based on a popular Dark Horse comic. As stated, time travel was discovered in 1994 and now there are people needed to prevent the past from being altered. One thing I didn't understand was that throughout the entire film, I only saw about two or three timecops. Where's everyone else? However, I only noticed this after the film had ended. I was too busy focusing on what was currently happening on screen. Going back to Van Damme, I was somewhat skeptical about his performance, but in the end, I had much appreciation for it. However, my only complaint is that he reminds me of other actors. His voice sounds a little like Antonio Banderas, his fighting techniques and flexibility, which are impressive, look too much like Jackie Chan's style, and lastly he sports this Peter Weller hair-do as if he were playing Alex Murphy from RoboCop (1987) and not a timecop. I'm not saying this is bad but I was hoping Van Damme would come out as his own actor and not like someone else. Like I said though, Van Damme is cool when he's fighting and he also has some comical moments too. I liked the character of Max Walker, I just thought he'd be somewhat more original and not a knock- off of some other character. Playing the villain, Aaron McComb, is Ron Silver, a corrupt politician who will do anything to make sure he's sitting in the president's chair by the end of the election. Even Silver has some unique moments where he lashes out at characters and then abruptly simmers down. This shows good characterization because it reveals what a loose cannon McComb is and why he's not fit for a president. Mia Sara portrays Max Walker's wife, Melissa Walker. I also think that the two actors made a good couple; too bad it wasn't real. Melissa definitely may not be a physically strong character, but she has a hardy spirit. As the film came to its finale, I had a fondness for her bravery. The special effects are also fair game. There wasn't anything that seemed to be overloaded with CGI and the idea of "matter occupying two spaces at one time" is also another visual treat to see. The part where the film shows how the police go back in time was intriguing as well. It recalled what it was like to first watch Back to the Future (1985), with a speeding vehicle hurtling towards some wall and then suddenly disappearing with track marks ablaze. Mark Isham composed the score to this film. Sadly, I did not feel a whole lot from it but and maybe that's because there was no theme song to it. But it definitely was a soundtrack, because it wasn't noise like Keith Emerson's score from Nighthawks (1981). What a mess that was! Peter Hyams' direction on the Dark Horse comic of a time traveling police officer not only boasts visuals, but also has a great story line. The characters are nicely acted and the action scenes are well played.

    Ever likable Jean-Claude Van Damme high kicks his way through this twisty and interesting futuristic sci-fi action thriller. He plays Max Walker, a cop who becomes part of an elite security force that polices time travel, which has become a reality. As can be expected, there are extremely unscrupulous types who seek nothing more than self gain when it comes to time travel, and typifying this behaviour is rotten, nasty, greedy S.o.B. senator Aaron McComb (Ron Silver, every bit the slick sleaze ball). Some interesting concepts here, and enough opportunity for Van Damme to show off his abilities, although the action is actually in service of the plot for once, the story being based on a comic book series. Director Peter Hyams (who would reunite with Van Damme for the following years' "Sudden Death") often lights scenes in his typical not-particularly-well-lit fashion, but he and a first rate crew still keep this movie racing forward quite effectively. With Van Dammes' character having to deal with a tragedy he would like to prevent, this adds some pathos to his character and allows him the chance to stretch himself more than usual. Silver is perfectly cast as his dapper nemesis, even if the role is pretty one-note and not exactly subtle. Mia Sara, probably best known as the title characters' girlfriend in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", looks lovely and is quite appealing. Gloria Reuben is sexy in a key supporting role, while solid character players like Bruce McGill and Kenneth Welsh have their moments. The story, much like any that deals with the whole idea of time travel, probably wouldn't hold up to much scrutiny, but the movie is a good entertainment that features some very impressive special effects, stunts, and sets, appropriately thuggish henchmen for our bad guy to employ and for our good guy to tussle with, and some highly amusing moments (such as a thug getting his arm frozen and then smashed to bits). Oh, and the viewers are treated to the sight of Van Damme doing the splits to avoid electrocution. Atmospherics are palpable; important scenes take place in the rain so there's often that feel of real gloom. A fun diversion from start to finish. Seven out of 10.

    I have watched Timecop at least three times, I do not remember much. I have read the synopsis of the movie on the IMDb site and none of it helps. Here is Timecop as best I know- JCVD does the spinning roundhouse kick thing, also there is a mall, i think a lot of the movie is in a mall. A lady is in the movie but I'm not sure if there is any nudity, classy. I mean I can read that Ron Silver is in the movie but I don't remember seeing him and you know he had a big role. Explosions occur but outside of the narrative, so that I remember that things explode in this movie but I cant recall why they blow up or what gets blown up, its a real mystery. I don't remember why he has to go back in time anyway, maybe its on accident or maybe on purpose, I don't remember his reason for time travel to be integral to the plot.

    With the exception of "The Terminator" series, the time travel sci-fi story has been on the brink of obscurity Sure there's been movies about time-travel, but not with combined action and awesome effects. I mean "Somewhere in Time" is more like a romance than an action flick and the brilliantly executed "12 Monkeys" doesn't quite qualify as an action flick. Sure Nick Meyer's "Time After Time" was excellent in action but it's a shame that it didn't garner much publicity. And that leaves us with Peter Hyams' 1994 classic "Timecop" which to me goes ways beyond the spectrum of a Jean-Claude van Damme film, but for those action junkies who love the Belgian behemoth it's still all is well. Science-fiction fans be advised: the tight factor of Robert Heinlein's early works like "By His Bootstraps" and "All You Zombies" is very absent. Mr Hyams and his scriptwriting duo of Mark Richardson and Mark Verheiden (who also collaborated with the "Dark Horse" comic this film is adapted from) was loosely taken from Poul Anderson's "Time Patrol" series. Largely due to the plot, a physically legit time traveling is in tact but it's also customized to rewrite the past. And what comes with the package are few antagonists around to foil things for their own evil intentions. Therefore, some time-travel cops join the fray to maintain the real timestream. This is where Van Damme steps into the the thick of things. And in the film he's up against Ron Silver who was in fine form as a Senator who has aspirations to become President determined so much to be in that position that he will break every rule in the book just to get there. In spite of the whole excitement of time-traveling, there are still some issues that remain indecipherable. Like for instance what's the deal with people blowing up whenever they encounter their earlier or later versions of themselves? The whole concept behind that is utterly ridiculous. Sure I wasn't expecting anything logical by far, but still it's never fully explained. But in spite of the irrational implausibilities, if you can get over it in some way, you'll be quite pleased with the craft put into it and and the dramatic factors implemented into the script works out quite subliminally. And even if you don't like Van Damme, who really gives a damn? I think those who have chastised Van Damme over the years have never seen this movie or never seen his previous work when he first started out. Sure he's no James Stewart or anything like that, but he's not as terrible as the mass have panned him out to be.

    In 1994, a bespectacled dude proposes the creation of a covert time travel agency to a committee of senators. He explains the complexities of time travel in a way you have likely never considered. "It turns out if you go back in time and you change something, it's serious! It's like throwing a stone in the water, causing ripples. Only the ripples are in time." Is your mind blown yet? The senator's response, "How much is this gonna cost? The economy is bad right now." Ten years later, we're in the ultra-futuristic era of 2004, where we have smart cars, a prominent "white supremacy party" and the automated voices on answering machines are more sultry and sexy than ever. But not as sexy as Van Damme flexing his ass cheeks on a kitchen counter while he evades a super high-tech tazer gun. Van Damme plays Walker Time Ranger, a mulletman with a broken heart who is tasked with going after self-proclaimed "Harvard visionary" villain McComb. McComb is a time bandit with a penchant for talking to himself. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you won't realize that's a joke. Things go bang, things go boom and a bad guy's arm gets shattered a la T-1000 in Terminator 2. Walker's in a fight against time. And if there's anyone who can kick a clock's ass, you can bet it's Van Damme.

    Time travel is always a neat concept when it comes to movies. It also can be quite confusing. And because there are these too extremes to using this idea, only some people can use it wisely enough and not have the film involve too much time travel. Director Peter Hyams displays that he's one of those people who can handle this kind of situation. From start to finish, I was thoroughly sure I knew where and what was going on. I wasn't confused once. This shows Hyams had control of how much time travel was used in one instance. Timecop is actually a generalization for the people who do the job, but focuses on the story of Max Walker (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a man who belongs to an institution of individuals who police time, based on a popular Dark Horse comic. As stated, time travel was discovered in 1994 and now there are people needed to prevent the past from being altered. One thing I didn't understand was that throughout the entire film, I only saw about two or three timecops. Where's everyone else? However, I only noticed this after the film had ended. I was too busy focusing on what was currently happening on screen. Going back to Van Damme, I was somewhat skeptical about his performance, but in the end, I had much appreciation for it. However, my only complaint is that he reminds me of other actors. His voice sounds a little like Antonio Banderas, his fighting techniques and flexibility, which are impressive, look too much like Jackie Chan's style, and lastly he sports this Peter Weller hair-do as if he were playing Alex Murphy from RoboCop (1987) and not a timecop. I'm not saying this is bad but I was hoping Van Damme would come out as his own actor and not like someone else. Like I said though, Van Damme is cool when he's fighting and he also has some comical moments too. I liked the character of Max Walker, I just thought he'd be somewhat more original and not a knock- off of some other character. Playing the villain, Aaron McComb, is Ron Silver, a corrupt politician who will do anything to make sure he's sitting in the president's chair by the end of the election. Even Silver has some unique moments where he lashes out at characters and then abruptly simmers down. This shows good characterization because it reveals what a loose cannon McComb is and why he's not fit for a president. Mia Sara portrays Max Walker's wife, Melissa Walker. I also think that the two actors made a good couple; too bad it wasn't real. Melissa definitely may not be a physically strong character, but she has a hardy spirit. As the film came to its finale, I had a fondness for her bravery. The special effects are also fair game. There wasn't anything that seemed to be overloaded with CGI and the idea of "matter occupying two spaces at one time" is also another visual treat to see. The part where the film shows how the police go back in time was intriguing as well. It recalled what it was like to first watch Back to the Future (1985), with a speeding vehicle hurtling towards some wall and then suddenly disappearing with track marks ablaze. Mark Isham composed the score to this film. Sadly, I did not feel a whole lot from it but and maybe that's because there was no theme song to it. But it definitely was a soundtrack, because it wasn't noise like Keith Emerson's score from Nighthawks (1981). What a mess that was! Peter Hyams' direction on the Dark Horse comic of a time traveling police officer not only boasts visuals, but also has a great story line. The characters are nicely acted and the action scenes are well played.

    Ever likable Jean-Claude Van Damme high kicks his way through this twisty and interesting futuristic sci-fi action thriller. He plays Max Walker, a cop who becomes part of an elite security force that polices time travel, which has become a reality. As can be expected, there are extremely unscrupulous types who seek nothing more than self gain when it comes to time travel, and typifying this behaviour is rotten, nasty, greedy S.o.B. senator Aaron McComb (Ron Silver, every bit the slick sleaze ball). Some interesting concepts here, and enough opportunity for Van Damme to show off his abilities, although the action is actually in service of the plot for once, the story being based on a comic book series. Director Peter Hyams (who would reunite with Van Damme for the following years' "Sudden Death") often lights scenes in his typical not-particularly-well-lit fashion, but he and a first rate crew still keep this movie racing forward quite effectively. With Van Dammes' character having to deal with a tragedy he would like to prevent, this adds some pathos to his character and allows him the chance to stretch himself more than usual. Silver is perfectly cast as his dapper nemesis, even if the role is pretty one-note and not exactly subtle. Mia Sara, probably best known as the title characters' girlfriend in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", looks lovely and is quite appealing. Gloria Reuben is sexy in a key supporting role, while solid character players like Bruce McGill and Kenneth Welsh have their moments. The story, much like any that deals with the whole idea of time travel, probably wouldn't hold up to much scrutiny, but the movie is a good entertainment that features some very impressive special effects, stunts, and sets, appropriately thuggish henchmen for our bad guy to employ and for our good guy to tussle with, and some highly amusing moments (such as a thug getting his arm frozen and then smashed to bits). Oh, and the viewers are treated to the sight of Van Damme doing the splits to avoid electrocution. Atmospherics are palpable; important scenes take place in the rain so there's often that feel of real gloom. A fun diversion from start to finish. Seven out of 10.

    Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ron Silver, Mia Sara and Bruce McGill star in this 1994 sci-fi film based on the comic book. Max Walker (Van Damme) is a cop who lost his murdered wife, Melissa (Sara) 10 years ago. He's also part of a time-travel program ran by his friend & captain, Eugene Matuzak (McGill). Max learns that a corrupt senator, Aaron McComb (Silver) is using the program to change history so he can make money for his campaign. Max also learns that McComb is responsible for Melissa's death and is now planning to go back and kill him. Max tells Matuzak of McComb's plans to be President and tries to stop him. He also helps Melissa and tries to save her from repeating death. This is a good comic book film and I think it's one of Van Damme's best. Silver was also a great villain as usual and I recommend this.

    Rather Prophetic regarding 2012 for a moovie made in 1994. This Dark Horse Comics movie has Van Damme, using his skills in a character driven role, rather than being a dead guy reanimated or playing against his twin self and beating himself up. I love Van Damme actually, and in this film he gets to act as well as do a few interesting personal injuries to various large thugs. In True Comic Book Fashion, this movie has several scenes of "prequel" - First, they show a scene taking place in the Civil War where a bandit- I think it's Callum Kieth Rennie - steals Confederate Gold. Then in the "present" day a group of senators meet and create an "oversight" committee for a law enforcement unit designed to protect the timeline. Then it's 1929 and the depression is starting, but one guy is doing well- Based on information he brought back from 2004! But then Van Damme shows up, kicks the guys bodyguards asses, and brings him back to the future as they tumble out of a 20th story window. Guy names who sent him back - But will not testify to it - And they return the crook to the same fall Van Damme saved him from, and S P L A T . And then there is a fourth scene which shows JCVD and his wife Mia Sara - This one a little longer than the others, in which he has just gotten a new job as a Timecop, gets called in, Crooks show up and try to kill him but kill his wife, Van Damme sees main crook Ron Silver, and "Then It Blew Up". It is like, we had to read 4 Prequel Comic Books just to get to the beginning of the story. But That is OK by Me, cos I love Comic Books and most of the moovies made from them, even the original Captain American moovie made in the 80's. Peter Hyams does his usual job at directing a well thought out movie, written by the actual guys who made the comics. This was 1994, Jean-Luc Picard Van Damme still looked pretty good, and although by today's standards, the special effects might be labeled "cheesy" - for 1994 they were state of the art, and actually cool. Hyams never stretched beyond what he was able to do, always made good use of available techs. He was able to fake us out in several very Paul Verhooven-ish style violence scenes- Crook getting frozen and then breaking in half, Electrocutions, shootings, disintegrations, etc. The plot follows Van Damme and Bruce McGill (Jack Dalton from MacGuver) through several nightmare permutations of events in time- Until finally Van Damme helps Van Damme. And the ending is your typical "Please God, Make it Never Happened" thing. Seeing how this moovie actually is rated around 7/10 in the IMDb scale, that means it fared well with most people who see it. It's a good moovie, if you like moovies, the locations are great, the LOOK of the movie is interesting, the gadgets do not look like props stolen from Star Trek or purchased at Radio Shack, and there are a few very cool special effects. Plus, it is NON STOP action from practically the beginning. There is always something happening - As opposed to people sitting on couches talking like about 90% of the scenes in Star Wars eps I through III. I loved this moovie when it came out and I love it now. Trying to find it on at least DVD.

    Ron Silver is a great villain, he always is and this movie is maybe the best example of how he can look like a scummy sleaze bag villain without even having to say anything. It is a typical Van Damme movie in many ways with decent fight scenes and a thin unbelievable plot, of course like in most time travel type movies there are a ton of plot holes you could drive a time travelling car through. Van Damme is good and I expected this to be a terrible movie but as far as Van Damme movies go it is probably one of the best and most fun. Not gonna win any awards or anything but definitely a decent way to waste a couple of hours, Ron Silver is amazing.

    Reading through their IMDb pages just now, I noticed that director Peter Hyams and action star Jean-Claude Van Damme will soon collaborate again on a thriller named "Enemies Closer". I think that's particularly good news for Van Damme, as it's my own personal and humble opinion that he accomplished his best films working with Hyams. Seemingly Hyams was the only director who brought a proper balance between demonstrating his martial arts skills and actually giving the opportunity to try and act! "Sudden Death" is a straightforward but extremely competent action flick set in a limited arena ("Die Hard" in a hockey stadium, in fact) and this "Timecop" is a more ambitious and polished Sci-Fi thriller revolving around time traveling. Hyams is more of an expert in the domain of Sci-Fi (with other semi-classic titles on his repertoire such as "Capricorn One", "Outland" and the hate-it-or-love-it cult movie "2010") and that clearly shows during the impressively staged time-catapulting sequences and the overall ease with which the convoluted and paradoxical subject matter is handled. On the other hand, the supposedly hi-tech futuristic gadgets and advanced technology looks incredibly banal and clich&eacute;d in my opinion, like for example the voice-operated cars and televisions in 2004. The plot is actually very similar to that of "Back to the Future, Part II" except  of course  with karate and gunfire instead of DeLoreans. It's all about Van Damme, as Time Enforcement Corps agent Max Walker, traveling back and forth in time to prevent naughty people from meddling with the future before it occurs. The sleazy Senator McComb teleports himself back from 2004 to 1994 to prevent his younger self from making the wrong financial decisions that will cost him the Presidential elections and, during the attempt to stop him, Max Walker discover the exact reasons why his wife got murdered that same year. Although he'll never win any Oscars, I really think Van Damme gives an adequate performance in "Timecop", with a word of thanks to the script and the supportive cast including Mia Sara and Bruce McGill. Best performance comes (as all too often in action movies) from the villain, with Ron Silver depicting a gloriously hateful corrupt politician. It's never made clear what happens to the time-traveling vehicles when arriving in the past. At least the DeLorean in "Back to the Future" always stayed with its passengers.

    This is pretty run-of-the-mill as far as sci-fi goes, and Van-Damme's acting wasn't any better than it was in his other films - contrary to popular opinion - but Peter Hyams' competent direction keeps the thing moving forward at a brisk pace, and Ron Silver makes for a wicked baddie that rivals his work in Blue Steel. If only the action were more exciting. Most of it consists of Walker staying in one position shooting at another guy, and vice-versa until somebody goes down for good. The shootouts lack energy and a sense of life for the most part. The fight scenes are......okay, but nothing that can compete with what I've seen in other actioners from that era. Oh yeah, and what was up with the villain's death scene? That was some frighteningly terrible CGI. I guess they were trying to rival the liquid metal effects in T2 and failed miserably. In fact, the entire finale was way too dark, like pitch black. I remember catching the finale on TV back in the day and noticed it was excessively dark then, too, but Blu-ray doesn't seem to have corrected the problem. Well, flaws aside, this is still one of Van Damme's better films, with some amusing moments here and there.

As can be expected, there are extremely unscrupulous types who seek nothing more than self gain when it comes to time travel, and typifying this behaviour is rotten, nasty, greedy S.o.B. senator Aaron McComb (Ron Silver, every bit the slick sleaze ball). Some interesting concepts here, and enough opportunity for Van Damme to show off his abilities, although the action is actually in service of the plot for once, the story being based on a comic book series. Director Peter Hyams (who would reunite with Van Damme for the following years' "Sudden Death") often lights scenes in his typical not-particularly-well-lit fashion, but he and a first rate crew still keep this movie racing forward quite effectively. With Van Dammes' character having to deal with a tragedy he would like to prevent, this adds some pathos to his character and allows him the chance to stretch himself more than usual. Silver is perfectly cast as his dapper nemesis, even if the role is pretty one-note and not exactly subtle. Mia Sara, probably best known as the title characters' girlfriend in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", looks lovely and is quite appealing. Gloria Reuben is sexy in a key supporting role, while solid character players like Bruce McGill and Kenneth Welsh have their moments. The story, much like any that deals with the whole idea of time travel, probably wouldn't hold up to much scrutiny, but the movie is a good entertainment that features some very impressive special effects, stunts, and sets, appropriately thuggish henchmen for our bad guy to employ and for our good guy to tussle with, and some highly amusing moments (such as a thug getting his arm frozen and then smashed to bits). Oh, and the viewers are treated to the sight of Van Damme doing the splits to avoid electrocution. Atmospherics are palpable; important scenes take place in the rain so there's often that feel of real gloom. A fun diversion from start to finish. Seven out of 10.

    Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ron Silver, Mia Sara and Bruce McGill star in this 1994 sci-fi film based on the comic book. Max Walker (Van Damme) is a cop who lost his murdered wife, Melissa (Sara) 10 years ago. He's also part of a time-travel program ran by his friend & captain, Eugene Matuzak (McGill). Max learns that a corrupt senator, Aaron McComb (Silver) is using the program to change history so he can make money for his campaign. Max also learns that McComb is responsible for Melissa's death and is now planning to go back and kill him. Max tells Matuzak of McComb's plans to be President and tries to stop him. He also helps Melissa and tries to save her from repeating death. This is a good comic book film and I think it's one of Van Damme's best. Silver was also a great villain as usual and I recommend this.

    Rather Prophetic regarding 2012 for a moovie made in 1994. This Dark Horse Comics movie has Van Damme, using his skills in a character driven role, rather than being a dead guy reanimated or playing against his twin self and beating himself up. I love Van Damme actually, and in this film he gets to act as well as do a few interesting personal injuries to various large thugs. In True Comic Book Fashion, this movie has several scenes of "prequel" - First, they show a scene taking place in the Civil War where a bandit- I think it's Callum Kieth Rennie - steals Confederate Gold. Then in the "present" day a group of senators meet and create an "oversight" committee for a law enforcement unit designed to protect the timeline. Then it's 1929 and the depression is starting, but one guy is doing well- Based on information he brought back from 2004! But then Van Damme shows up, kicks the guys bodyguards asses, and brings him back to the future as they tumble out of a 20th story window. Guy names who sent him back - But will not testify to it - And they return the crook to the same fall Van Damme saved him from, and S P L A T . And then there is a fourth scene which shows JCVD and his wife Mia Sara - This one a little longer than the others, in which he has just gotten a new job as a Timecop, gets called in, Crooks show up and try to kill him but kill his wife, Van Damme sees main crook Ron Silver, and "Then It Blew Up". It is like, we had to read 4 Prequel Comic Books just to get to the beginning of the story. But That is OK by Me, cos I love Comic Books and most of the moovies made from them, even the original Captain American moovie made in the 80's. Peter Hyams does his usual job at directing a well thought out movie, written by the actual guys who made the comics. This was 1994, Jean-Luc Picard Van Damme still looked pretty good, and although by today's standards, the special effects might be labeled "cheesy" - for 1994 they were state of the art, and actually cool. Hyams never stretched beyond what he was able to do, always made good use of available techs. He was able to fake us out in several very Paul Verhooven-ish style violence scenes- Crook getting frozen and then breaking in half, Electrocutions, shootings, disintegrations, etc. The plot follows Van Damme and Bruce McGill (Jack Dalton from MacGuver) through several nightmare permutations of events in time- Until finally Van Damme helps Van Damme. And the ending is your typical "Please God, Make it Never Happened" thing. Seeing how this moovie actually is rated around 7/10 in the IMDb scale, that means it fared well with most people who see it. It's a good moovie, if you like moovies, the locations are great, the LOOK of the movie is interesting, the gadgets do not look like props stolen from Star Trek or purchased at Radio Shack, and there are a few very cool special effects. Plus, it is NON STOP action from practically the beginning. There is always something happening - As opposed to people sitting on couches talking like about 90% of the scenes in Star Wars eps I through III. I loved this moovie when it came out and I love it now. Trying to find it on at least DVD.

    Ron Silver is a great villain, he always is and this movie is maybe the best example of how he can look like a scummy sleaze bag villain without even having to say anything. It is a typical Van Damme movie in many ways with decent fight scenes and a thin unbelievable plot, of course like in most time travel type movies there are a ton of plot holes you could drive a time travelling car through. Van Damme is good and I expected this to be a terrible movie but as far as Van Damme movies go it is probably one of the best and most fun. Not gonna win any awards or anything but definitely a decent way to waste a couple of hours, Ron Silver is amazing.

    Reading through their IMDb pages just now, I noticed that director Peter Hyams and action star Jean-Claude Van Damme will soon collaborate again on a thriller named "Enemies Closer". I think that's particularly good news for Van Damme, as it's my own personal and humble opinion that he accomplished his best films working with Hyams. Seemingly Hyams was the only director who brought a proper balance between demonstrating his martial arts skills and actually giving the opportunity to try and act! "Sudden Death" is a straightforward but extremely competent action flick set in a limited arena ("Die Hard" in a hockey stadium, in fact) and this "Timecop" is a more ambitious and polished Sci-Fi thriller revolving around time traveling. Hyams is more of an expert in the domain of Sci-Fi (with other semi-classic titles on his repertoire such as "Capricorn One", "Outland" and the hate-it-or-love-it cult movie "2010") and that clearly shows during the impressively staged time-catapulting sequences and the overall ease with which the convoluted and paradoxical subject matter is handled. On the other hand, the supposedly hi-tech futuristic gadgets and advanced technology looks incredibly banal and clich&eacute;d in my opinion, like for example the voice-operated cars and televisions in 2004. The plot is actually very similar to that of "Back to the Future, Part II" except  of course  with karate and gunfire instead of DeLoreans. It's all about Van Damme, as Time Enforcement Corps agent Max Walker, traveling back and forth in time to prevent naughty people from meddling with the future before it occurs. The sleazy Senator McComb teleports himself back from 2004 to 1994 to prevent his younger self from making the wrong financial decisions that will cost him the Presidential elections and, during the attempt to stop him, Max Walker discover the exact reasons why his wife got murdered that same year. Although he'll never win any Oscars, I really think Van Damme gives an adequate performance in "Timecop", with a word of thanks to the script and the supportive cast including Mia Sara and Bruce McGill. Best performance comes (as all too often in action movies) from the villain, with Ron Silver depicting a gloriously hateful corrupt politician. It's never made clear what happens to the time-traveling vehicles when arriving in the past. At least the DeLorean in "Back to the Future" always stayed with its passengers.

    This is pretty run-of-the-mill as far as sci-fi goes, and Van-Damme's acting wasn't any better than it was in his other films - contrary to popular opinion - but Peter Hyams' competent direction keeps the thing moving forward at a brisk pace, and Ron Silver makes for a wicked baddie that rivals his work in Blue Steel. If only the action were more exciting. Most of it consists of Walker staying in one position shooting at another guy, and vice-versa until somebody goes down for good. The shootouts lack energy and a sense of life for the most part. The fight scenes are......okay, but nothing that can compete with what I've seen in other actioners from that era. Oh yeah, and what was up with the villain's death scene? That was some frighteningly terrible CGI. I guess they were trying to rival the liquid metal effects in T2 and failed miserably. In fact, the entire finale was way too dark, like pitch black. I remember catching the finale on TV back in the day and noticed it was excessively dark then, too, but Blu-ray doesn't seem to have corrected the problem. Well, flaws aside, this is still one of Van Damme's better films, with some amusing moments here and there.

    I have watched Timecop at least three times, I do not remember much. I have read the synopsis of the movie on the IMDb site and none of it helps. Here is Timecop as best I know- JCVD does the spinning roundhouse kick thing, also there is a mall, i think a lot of the movie is in a mall. A lady is in the movie but I'm not sure if there is any nudity, classy. I mean I can read that Ron Silver is in the movie but I don't remember seeing him and you know he had a big role. Explosions occur but outside of the narrative, so that I remember that things explode in this movie but I cant recall why they blow up or what gets blown up, its a real mystery. I don't remember why he has to go back in time anyway, maybe its on accident or maybe on purpose, I don't remember his reason for time travel to be integral to the plot.

    With the exception of "The Terminator" series, the time travel sci-fi story has been on the brink of obscurity Sure there's been movies about time-travel, but not with combined action and awesome effects. I mean "Somewhere in Time" is more like a romance than an action flick and the brilliantly executed "12 Monkeys" doesn't quite qualify as an action flick. Sure Nick Meyer's "Time After Time" was excellent in action but it's a shame that it didn't garner much publicity. And that leaves us with Peter Hyams' 1994 classic "Timecop" which to me goes ways beyond the spectrum of a Jean-Claude van Damme film, but for those action junkies who love the Belgian behemoth it's still all is well. Science-fiction fans be advised: the tight factor of Robert Heinlein's early works like "By His Bootstraps" and "All You Zombies" is very absent. Mr Hyams and his scriptwriting duo of Mark Richardson and Mark Verheiden (who also collaborated with the "Dark Horse" comic this film is adapted from) was loosely taken from Poul Anderson's "Time Patrol" series. Largely due to the plot, a physically legit time traveling is in tact but it's also customized to rewrite the past. And what comes with the package are few antagonists around to foil things for their own evil intentions. Therefore, some time-travel cops join the fray to maintain the real timestream. This is where Van Damme steps into the the thick of things. And in the film he's up against Ron Silver who was in fine form as a Senator who has aspirations to become President determined so much to be in that position that he will break every rule in the book just to get there. In spite of the whole excitement of time-traveling, there are still some issues that remain indecipherable. Like for instance what's the deal with people blowing up whenever they encounter their earlier or later versions of themselves? The whole concept behind that is utterly ridiculous. Sure I wasn't expecting anything logical by far, but still it's never fully explained. But in spite of the irrational implausibilities, if you can get over it in some way, you'll be quite pleased with the craft put into it and and the dramatic factors implemented into the script works out quite subliminally. And even if you don't like Van Damme, who really gives a damn? I think those who have chastised Van Damme over the years have never seen this movie or never seen his previous work when he first started out. Sure he's no James Stewart or anything like that, but he's not as terrible as the mass have panned him out to be.

    In 1994, a bespectacled dude proposes the creation of a covert time travel agency to a committee of senators. He explains the complexities of time travel in a way you have likely never considered. "It turns out if you go back in time and you change something, it's serious! It's like throwing a stone in the water, causing ripples. Only the ripples are in time." Is your mind blown yet? The senator's response, "How much is this gonna cost? The economy is bad right now." Ten years later, we're in the ultra-futuristic era of 2004, where we have smart cars, a prominent "white supremacy party" and the automated voices on answering machines are more sultry and sexy than ever. But not as sexy as Van Damme flexing his ass cheeks on a kitchen counter while he evades a super high-tech tazer gun. Van Damme plays Walker Time Ranger, a mulletman with a broken heart who is tasked with going after self-proclaimed "Harvard visionary" villain McComb. McComb is a time bandit with a penchant for talking to himself. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you won't realize that's a joke. Things go bang, things go boom and a bad guy's arm gets shattered a la T-1000 in Terminator 2. Walker's in a fight against time. And if there's anyone who can kick a clock's ass, you can bet it's Van Damme.

    Time travel is always a neat concept when it comes to movies. It also can be quite confusing. And because there are these too extremes to using this idea, only some people can use it wisely enough and not have the film involve too much time travel. Director Peter Hyams displays that he's one of those people who can handle this kind of situation. From start to finish, I was thoroughly sure I knew where and what was going on. I wasn't confused once. This shows Hyams had control of how much time travel was used in one instance. Timecop is actually a generalization for the people who do the job, but focuses on the story of Max Walker (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a man who belongs to an institution of individuals who police time, based on a popular Dark Horse comic. As stated, time travel was discovered in 1994 and now there are people needed to prevent the past from being altered. One thing I didn't understand was that throughout the entire film, I only saw about two or three timecops. Where's everyone else? However, I only noticed this after the film had ended. I was too busy focusing on what was currently happening on screen. Going back to Van Damme, I was somewhat skeptical about his performance, but in the end, I had much appreciation for it. However, my only complaint is that he reminds me of other actors. His voice sounds a little like Antonio Banderas, his fighting techniques and flexibility, which are impressive, look too much like Jackie Chan's style, and lastly he sports this Peter Weller hair-do as if he were playing Alex Murphy from RoboCop (1987) and not a timecop. I'm not saying this is bad but I was hoping Van Damme would come out as his own actor and not like someone else. Like I said though, Van Damme is cool when he's fighting and he also has some comical moments too. I liked the character of Max Walker, I just thought he'd be somewhat more original and not a knock- off of some other character. Playing the villain, Aaron McComb, is Ron Silver, a corrupt politician who will do anything to make sure he's sitting in the president's chair by the end of the election. Even Silver has some unique moments where he lashes out at characters and then abruptly simmers down. This shows good characterization because it reveals what a loose cannon McComb is and why he's not fit for a president. Mia Sara portrays Max Walker's wife, Melissa Walker. I also think that the two actors made a good couple; too bad it wasn't real. Melissa definitely may not be a physically strong character, but she has a hardy spirit. As the film came to its finale, I had a fondness for her bravery. The special effects are also fair game. There wasn't anything that seemed to be overloaded with CGI and the idea of "matter occupying two spaces at one time" is also another visual treat to see. The part where the film shows how the police go back in time was intriguing as well. It recalled what it was like to first watch Back to the Future (1985), with a speeding vehicle hurtling towards some wall and then suddenly disappearing with track marks ablaze. Mark Isham composed the score to this film. Sadly, I did not feel a whole lot from it but and maybe that's because there was no theme song to it. But it definitely was a soundtrack, because it wasn't noise like Keith Emerson's score from Nighthawks (1981). What a mess that was! Peter Hyams' direction on the Dark Horse comic of a time traveling police officer not only boasts visuals, but also has a great story line. The characters are nicely acted and the action scenes are well played.
