 <sinopse>
  A deformed bellringer must assert his independence from a vicious government minister in order to help his friend, a gypsy dancing girl.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In 15th century Paris, Clopin the puppeteer tells the story of Quasimodo, the misshapen gentle-souled bell ringer of Notre Dame, who was nearly killed as a baby by Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice. But Frollo was forced by the Archdeacon of Notre Dame to raise Quasimodo as his own. Now a young man, Quasimodo is hidden from the world by Frollo in the belltower of the cathedral. But during the Festival of Fools, Quasimodo, cheered on by his gargoyle friends Victor, Hugo, and Laverne, decides to take part in the festivities, where he meets the lively gypsy girl Esmeralda and the handsome soldier Phoebus. The three of them find themselves ranged against Frollo's cruelty and his attempts to destroy the home of the gypsies, the Court of Miracles. And Quasimodo must desperately defend both Esmeralda and the very cathedral of Notre Dame.

    In 15th century Paris, Quasimodo the hunchback of Notre Dame falls for gypsy girl Esmeralda who was the only one to show him kindness. Claude Frollo the Minister of Justice has kept Quasimodo hidden in the belltower. The cruel Frollo set his soldiers to destroy the world of the gypsy and it's up to Quasimodo and the handsome Phoebus to come to the rescue. This Disney animation looks great. The story is a beautiful poignant story of sacrifice and love. The only thing missing is a really good iconic song. That would have added at least a point. The characters are really compelling.

    The Hunchback of Notre Dame was a film I never saw as a child. For some reason, my parents didn't own it and I remember watching the typical films like The Lion King, The Little Mermaid and many princess type films as I was a typical girly girl. I've gotten into a Disney obsession, wanting to watch all the Disney movies and I one I desperately wanted to see was The Hunchback of Notre Dame, after seeing praising reviews and friends saying it was a very fabulous film. So, is it any good? The Hunchback of Notre Dame sets in 15th century, France and tells the story of the bellringer, Quasimodo who lives in the belltower. After Judge Claude Frollo killed his mother and father when Quasi was a baby, the Archdeacon convinces him to raise as him as his son. 20 years later, another year has passed and it's time for Quasi's favourite past-time, watching the Feast of Fools. Desperately wanting to go, he leaves the bell tower, but to be shamed and humiliated in front of the crowd due to his disfigured look until Esmeralda, a kind gypsy, saves him. Meanwhile, Frollo is trying to get rid of the gypsies, especially Esmeralda and is desperately wanting to get rid of her. I'll stop the main plot here. The movie is absolutely amazing. From the start, I was sitting on the edge of my seat in awe. The animation is smooth and it's at Disney's finest. The colours and themes mix together so well, and it makes the film look beautiful! The songs are perfect. I honestly believe it has the best sound-track out of any Disney film I have ever seen and trust me, I'm a huge fan of Disney. From the choirs, to the echoing instrument, all of the music is absolutely beautiful. I've even downloaded some on my iPod because the songs give me chills every time. The characters are very likable and Frollo has become my favourite Disney villain. He is the most evilest villain I have ever seen! Esmeralda has become my favourite Disney girl. She's so strong, tough and absolutely kind, a great role model for children and adults alike. Quasi is so kind and such a great character, they nailed him perfectly and I defiantly expected for him to be like what he is in the movie before watching it. Is it for kids? The truth is, it is one of Disney's darkest films, I honestly believe it's the darkest. With themes like murder, sex and more, this may not be suitable for children. Possibly 9 and up. If you're an over-protective parent, maybe keep the movie until they're a bit older. Some children may get confused at the plot, but I'm sure they'll enjoy it anyway. If you're watching it with your child, I'm sure you'll love it too. It's an absolute favourite of mine and I know parents will love it!

    This has got to be one of my least favorite Disney Films. It support's a weak script, un- necessary characters, and has a poor over all message. This film didn't take the books material to best use. This could have been stretched out further, and half of the screen time is spent on the lesser characters. Quasimodo should have had more screen time. The voice work and villain are top notch and so is the animation but everything else is a total disaster. The villain gets very little screen time but when he does get screen time it's dark, and suspenseful. Tom Hulce and Tony Jay support excellent voice work as their characters.The voice work is deep, provoking, original, and emotionally depth. Overall this is a very disappointing Disney Animated Film.

    When I see a Disney animated I look for 3 things, just 3 simple things, the original songs, the humor, and the theme. I think that this movie failed miserably at all of these. First, the songs. They're not original, as most of them tried to be something that has happen in other Disney's classics already. For example in Quasimodo's love song, I can hear the chemistry - the beat sort of - from Be Our Guest running. The songs aren't original. Second, the humor. The only gags are slapstick and not even the good kind. Their humor is cheap, just lots of guys getting hit in the balls. The best of all the humor is probably the 3 stone stooges, which is no where near its past, like Lumiere and co. Last, the theme. Disney movies are supposed to have a simple and just purely good theme. Let's say Beauty and the Beast's redemption from evil, or Pocahontas's love can overcome anything, this movie is no where match. The theme is what, religion and hellfire. I call that bullsh-t. In summary, this is no where near anything Disney has ever done and is terrible at being a Disney family everyone loved.

    When this movie came out, I eventually saw it with some of my friends, and though my mother watched it as well, she never added it to our Disney movie library. I always wondered why not, because I loved the music. Now that I am a parent myself and recently watched this again, I understand. There are several pros and cons to this movie, so I will try to outline what I think of it. Pros: Amazing animation and wonderful songs. Also, most of the voice casting is excellent (including the late Mary Wicks as one of the gargoyles). The songs are both memorable and well-written, and the animation is breathtaking! Cons: Now, for an adult, this film has nothing scandalous or inappropriate, however, for a child, I don't agree. The very sexual nature of Esmeralda, from her dancing to her being lusted after by the judge, is definitely not kid-friendly. I mean, why is there all of this sexual tension in a kids movie? Also, the movie is nearly nothing like the book (which is a classic!). However, the book is rather dark, so I can understand lightening it up for kids. But, overall, this movie is rather dark, scary, and a bit too sexual for my tastes (at least for younger children). Overall, this movie has many pros and several cons. My daughter is 4, so she doesn't notice the cons as much (though she definitely prefers the lighter Disney movies like Mary Poppins and Cinderella), but I don't think I am comfortable letting her watch this movie a whole lot. To me, it is not the kind of Disney movie that I am a big fan of, though there are parts about it that I love! All in all, it's up to each parent to decide about this movie, but I would advise to let your kids be a bit older before letting them watch this one!

    As you can probably tell from the summary that this movie isn't that fit for kids. Yet, I still find it to be one of the most underrated films of all time. Why? Well for starters Disney took A LOT of risk with this movie. Instead of making it bright, colorful, and family friendly, "Hunchback" is dark, a little disturbing, and surprisingly has a lot of mature themes. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story. It's about a disfigured man named Quasimodo who lives on top of the bell towers of Notre Damme for all his life because according to his master, Claude Frollo, his "kind" is not welcomed in the streets of Paris and therefore he must spend the rest of his life isolated at the bells of Notre Damme. that's all I'm gonna reveal because I really don't want to spoil the film for you because despite being different from all the other Disney films, I think that "Hunchback of Notre Damme" is magnificent. I like to think of it as the "Dark Knight" of Disney films. Remember when "The Dark Knight" came out? Audiences were so shocked yet so blown away at how dark, gripping, emotional, and complex it was compared to other superhero movies. And it's no surprise that it's often credited as one of the greatest movies ever made today. But why do a lot of people hate Hunchback so much? It did the same thing "the Dark Knight" did, hell it even came out before the "Dark Knight". Why is it forgotten? Well, maybe it's because it's a Disney Movie. Maybe people were tired of the way superheroes were and were happy with the changes that "Dark Knight" gave. When people watch a Disney movie, they expect a colorful movie that's fit for the family. Not a dark film about a disfigured man that is shunned from society. You expect that from Tim Burton, not Disney. Yet again, being different isn't always bad. Just like this movie. I'll admit, I didn't like Hunchback that much as a kid either, and it wasn't until a more recent viewing that I come to respect it. On top of that, this movie arguably offered one of the greatest Disney villains of all time. (watch the movie to find out who it is). He's complex, menacing, and just pure evil. The things he does in the movie is unlike anything any other Disney villain has done before. What about the songs? For the most part, the songs were pretty good, great actually. Particularly the opening and the villain song "Hellfire". So overall, I say go check it out. It's definitely not for everybody, but if you're looking for something different or if you like a movie with a little dark twist, then you should definitely go see it. Just make sure you don't show your kids.

    Disney does have a history of producing some dark films in the past. The Black Cauldron (1985) was the first Disney animated feature to be given a PG rating by the MPAA for a reason. Disney has also had a history of showing young audiences some scary stuff in the past. Remember the evil queen's beggar disguise in Snow White or the "Night on Bald Mountain" sequence in Fantasia or even the pink elephants scene from Dumbo? Those scenes were memorably creepy. Disney has basically made some dark stuff in the past before. But arguably, the darkest and most adult film the Disney Company has produced so far would have to be their 34th full- length animated feature, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Think of this movie as a darker and more complex version of Cinderella (1950). It tells the story of a deformed person named Quasimodo (Tom Hulce) who is forced to stay in the bell tower of Notre Dame by his evil guardian, Frollo (Tony Jay). His only friends are three gargoyles who come to life when no one else is around. One day, Quasimodo goes out of the bell tower to go to the Festival of Fools, a celebration of all kinds of misfits, against Frollo's wishes. When Frollo's guards publicly humiliate Quasimodo in the middle of the festival, a gypsy named Esmeralda (Demi Moore) comes to his defense just as Frollo orders for her to be arrested. But luckily, Esmeralda escapes using her magic tricks that are considered illegal. Now, Frollo is on the hunt for Esmeralda determined to "put her to justice" (I put quotations around that since she really didn't do anything wrong per se). Little does Frollo know that Esmeralda has befriended Quasimodo and (as Frollo would put it) "cast him under a spell" of sorts meaning she teaches Quasimodo that it's okay to be different and that gypsies aren't bad people like Frollo claims that they are. Frollo's Captain of the Guard, Phoebus also befriends these two secretly through other various circumstances since he does not approve of the actions committed by Frollo. Will these three be able to put an end to Frollo's madness or fail? I believe that the most fascinating character in The Hunchback of Notre Dame has got to be the main antagonist, Frollo. Without question, I would easily consider Frollo one of the most complex, adult characters ever concocted by Disney. I personally find it brilliant that he always tries to justify any crimes he commits by claiming that it's all part of God's plan. I also find it clever that he thinks Esmeralda has put a spell on him since he has two intriguing and assuredly sinister plans lined up for when he captures her. He will either burn her at the stake so he can be "cured" of this spell he claims he's under or force her to become romantically involved with him to cure his underlying lust for her. You wouldn't think that this is a Disney flick I'm talking about just based on how I'm describing him, but to be honest, that's why I think he's such a special villain. The drawing and animation in The Hunchback of Notre Dame is simply sensational. The environments that are brought to life in this film really do feel epic because of the scope and detail of the animation. Much like Beauty and the Beast (1991) before it, one needs to simply look at the film first hand in able to truly appreciate the skilled craft and expertise that was put into the film's animation. The music is also spectacular, praise in particular goes to the strong work of the choir for again making everything happening on screen feel so epic in scope. The best songs in this film have got to be "Hellfire" and "The Bells of Notre Dame" because they really do have that elegant and epic quality to them. In addition to that, these songs keep the story moving along as the best musical numbers should. The only personal criticism I could make for this film is that I would have liked to see this film go even darker. The reason for that is because the storytellers here did such a good job at taking a story with adult subject matter and churning it into something palatable for kids. They did so well in fact that I would have edited out the parts with the gargoyles and the slapstick moments since they're basically more dramatically distracting than helpful to the plot. I think had the gargoyles and slapstick stuff that was meant to appeal to the kids been taken out, The Hunchback of Notre Dame would easily rank as one of the finest pictures ever put out by Disney. As it is though, the criticisms wouldn't matter too much since I already think that this is Disney's most underrated animated feature since Alice in Wonderland (1951). In addition to being a visual marvel to feast my eyes on and a pleasure to listen to with such killer songs such as the ones I've stated before, The Hunchback of Notre Dame does an exceptional job at teaching kids the importance of tolerating people of a different culture, religion, race, and visual appearance. This is a remarkable achievement, one of the studio's finest.

    Let me say that this is one of my FAVORITE MOVIES EVER! <3 And I think it is a SUPER underrated Disney film.I've heard some people say that the songs are weak compared to the songs in more acclaimed Disney films like Aladdin or The Little Mermaid.I TOTALLY disagree.I think the opening song is VERY powerful and God Help the Outcasts was simply beautiful and worked wonderful with Esmeralda's voice.Heaven's Light was a really beautiful and bittersweet song(bittersweet because we know what happens later)And the Hell Fire sequence was freaking EPIC.And am I the only one that found the gargoyle's song catchy and not annoying?Anyway,I also thought the score was AMAZING.I mean just listen to how powerful it sounds.It's all FSDUHAGAJBAMGK(that means amazingly powerful.)From the beginning by just hearing the music you can already tell the movie is going to be epic! Let's move on with the characters!I love the characters in this movie!Quasimodo is plain out lovable.I don't see how you can dislike such a sweet character.He is also a strong character who truly cares about Esmeralda,even when she does break his heart he still helps her because he truly cared about her.Phoebes is funny and I love his attitude and the way he stood for what was right even though there were consequences for him.And Esmeralda is an awesome heroine!I also love how she stands up for what is right and rebels.She's so kind and sly too.I didn't think the Gargoyles were annoying,I actually kinda liked them.I can't decide if the movie would be better without their comic relief or not though.However,the comic relief didn't ruin the tone of the film so that's good.As for the villain,Frollo was awesome!I loved his personality and sinisterness(is that a word?)And he is different than all the other Disney villains.He wasn't just out for power and he wasn't evil simply because he liked being evil.He actually thought everything he did was for God so that's really unique in terms of Disney villainy....And Frollo was just plain out awesome. The animation in this movie is beautiful.(well this is Disney,it's not like it would have crappy animation)I really wish Disney would make more beautiful hand drawn animated movies.The computer animation for the backgrounds and what not blended in well without looking cheezy.I love the vibrant colors and wonderful detailed backgrounds,especially in the cathedral. I thought this was a wonderful adaption to a rather grim story.A lot of changes were made to make the film more suitable for children but I give Disney credit for not totally screwing up the story and still keeping some of the more mature elements instead of making it all kiddy kiddy.Yes,it's a Disney film and it's still meant for children so they took out the more brutal things and gave it a ''the good guys live happily ever after'' ending but I'm glad they at least didn't keep the ending TOTALLY perfectly happy(poor Quasi not getting Esmeralda)I recommend this film to all children,animation buffs,or anyone who likes a good family movie ^.^ 10 out of 10 stars!Thanks for reading,my kitties!ღ

    I'm sorry, but I am a Disney fanatic, freak, whatever you want to call it and I cannot stand this movie. This is the one time Disney has failed in my eyes. I don't see why anyone would like this movie. And it's not because the main character is fugly and gross, it's because of the end. I thought it sent a terrible message to kids. The guy totally falls in love with Esmeralda, goes out of his way (I mean above and beyond the call of duty) to rescue her and be the good guy to prove his love for her...and she ends up with the handsome one?! What kind of message is that? To me that is Disney saying "the hot girl belongs with the hot guy and the fugly hero can never have true love". I don't know if this movie is based off a book or a true story, so if that is the case then I could kind of forgive it...but if not, Disney made a huge mistake. There are some good songs, the villain is very easy to hate, and the handsome soldier guy does provide some comedy relief along with the gargoyles, but other than that movie pretty much sucks.

    Considered as Disney's one of darkest films of all times, Hunchback of Notre Dame is still one of my most favorite masterpiece Disney has created (the other one being Beauty and the Beast). The songs, unlike what other reviewers said, were fantastic. I mean, compared to the likes of Lion King and Little Mermaid, the songs weren't for the children, but it's so moving and wonderful. Plus the orchestration and the score, Menken totally deserved the Oscar for that. It's so sad that this is considered one of Disney's most underrated film. Anyways, I'm really looking forward to see this on Broadway (there've been rumors), and I know that this will succeed on Broadway because the songs and the story for that matter is really Broadway's, if you know what I mean... All in all, great film nevertheless..

    When this movie came out, I eventually saw it with some of my friends, and though my mother watched it as well, she never added it to our Disney movie library. I always wondered why not, because I loved the music. Now that I am a parent myself and recently watched this again, I understand. There are several pros and cons to this movie, so I will try to outline what I think of it. Pros: Amazing animation and wonderful songs. Also, most of the voice casting is excellent (including the late Mary Wicks as one of the gargoyles). The songs are both memorable and well-written, and the animation is breathtaking! Cons: Now, for an adult, this film has nothing scandalous or inappropriate, however, for a child, I don't agree. The very sexual nature of Esmeralda, from her dancing to her being lusted after by the judge, is definitely not kid-friendly. I mean, why is there all of this sexual tension in a kids movie? Also, the movie is nearly nothing like the book (which is a classic!). However, the book is rather dark, so I can understand lightening it up for kids. But, overall, this movie is rather dark, scary, and a bit too sexual for my tastes (at least for younger children). Overall, this movie has many pros and several cons. My daughter is 4, so she doesn't notice the cons as much (though she definitely prefers the lighter Disney movies like Mary Poppins and Cinderella), but I don't think I am comfortable letting her watch this movie a whole lot. To me, it is not the kind of Disney movie that I am a big fan of, though there are parts about it that I love! All in all, it's up to each parent to decide about this movie, but I would advise to let your kids be a bit older before letting them watch this one!

    As you can probably tell from the summary that this movie isn't that fit for kids. Yet, I still find it to be one of the most underrated films of all time. Why? Well for starters Disney took A LOT of risk with this movie. Instead of making it bright, colorful, and family friendly, "Hunchback" is dark, a little disturbing, and surprisingly has a lot of mature themes. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story. It's about a disfigured man named Quasimodo who lives on top of the bell towers of Notre Damme for all his life because according to his master, Claude Frollo, his "kind" is not welcomed in the streets of Paris and therefore he must spend the rest of his life isolated at the bells of Notre Damme. that's all I'm gonna reveal because I really don't want to spoil the film for you because despite being different from all the other Disney films, I think that "Hunchback of Notre Damme" is magnificent. I like to think of it as the "Dark Knight" of Disney films. Remember when "The Dark Knight" came out? Audiences were so shocked yet so blown away at how dark, gripping, emotional, and complex it was compared to other superhero movies. And it's no surprise that it's often credited as one of the greatest movies ever made today. But why do a lot of people hate Hunchback so much? It did the same thing "the Dark Knight" did, hell it even came out before the "Dark Knight". Why is it forgotten? Well, maybe it's because it's a Disney Movie. Maybe people were tired of the way superheroes were and were happy with the changes that "Dark Knight" gave. When people watch a Disney movie, they expect a colorful movie that's fit for the family. Not a dark film about a disfigured man that is shunned from society. You expect that from Tim Burton, not Disney. Yet again, being different isn't always bad. Just like this movie. I'll admit, I didn't like Hunchback that much as a kid either, and it wasn't until a more recent viewing that I come to respect it. On top of that, this movie arguably offered one of the greatest Disney villains of all time. (watch the movie to find out who it is). He's complex, menacing, and just pure evil. The things he does in the movie is unlike anything any other Disney villain has done before. What about the songs? For the most part, the songs were pretty good, great actually. Particularly the opening and the villain song "Hellfire". So overall, I say go check it out. It's definitely not for everybody, but if you're looking for something different or if you like a movie with a little dark twist, then you should definitely go see it. Just make sure you don't show your kids.

    Disney does have a history of producing some dark films in the past. The Black Cauldron (1985) was the first Disney animated feature to be given a PG rating by the MPAA for a reason. Disney has also had a history of showing young audiences some scary stuff in the past. Remember the evil queen's beggar disguise in Snow White or the "Night on Bald Mountain" sequence in Fantasia or even the pink elephants scene from Dumbo? Those scenes were memorably creepy. Disney has basically made some dark stuff in the past before. But arguably, the darkest and most adult film the Disney Company has produced so far would have to be their 34th full- length animated feature, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Think of this movie as a darker and more complex version of Cinderella (1950). It tells the story of a deformed person named Quasimodo (Tom Hulce) who is forced to stay in the bell tower of Notre Dame by his evil guardian, Frollo (Tony Jay). His only friends are three gargoyles who come to life when no one else is around. One day, Quasimodo goes out of the bell tower to go to the Festival of Fools, a celebration of all kinds of misfits, against Frollo's wishes. When Frollo's guards publicly humiliate Quasimodo in the middle of the festival, a gypsy named Esmeralda (Demi Moore) comes to his defense just as Frollo orders for her to be arrested. But luckily, Esmeralda escapes using her magic tricks that are considered illegal. Now, Frollo is on the hunt for Esmeralda determined to "put her to justice" (I put quotations around that since she really didn't do anything wrong per se). Little does Frollo know that Esmeralda has befriended Quasimodo and (as Frollo would put it) "cast him under a spell" of sorts meaning she teaches Quasimodo that it's okay to be different and that gypsies aren't bad people like Frollo claims that they are. Frollo's Captain of the Guard, Phoebus also befriends these two secretly through other various circumstances since he does not approve of the actions committed by Frollo. Will these three be able to put an end to Frollo's madness or fail? I believe that the most fascinating character in The Hunchback of Notre Dame has got to be the main antagonist, Frollo. Without question, I would easily consider Frollo one of the most complex, adult characters ever concocted by Disney. I personally find it brilliant that he always tries to justify any crimes he commits by claiming that it's all part of God's plan. I also find it clever that he thinks Esmeralda has put a spell on him since he has two intriguing and assuredly sinister plans lined up for when he captures her. He will either burn her at the stake so he can be "cured" of this spell he claims he's under or force her to become romantically involved with him to cure his underlying lust for her. You wouldn't think that this is a Disney flick I'm talking about just based on how I'm describing him, but to be honest, that's why I think he's such a special villain. The drawing and animation in The Hunchback of Notre Dame is simply sensational. The environments that are brought to life in this film really do feel epic because of the scope and detail of the animation. Much like Beauty and the Beast (1991) before it, one needs to simply look at the film first hand in able to truly appreciate the skilled craft and expertise that was put into the film's animation. The music is also spectacular, praise in particular goes to the strong work of the choir for again making everything happening on screen feel so epic in scope. The best songs in this film have got to be "Hellfire" and "The Bells of Notre Dame" because they really do have that elegant and epic quality to them. In addition to that, these songs keep the story moving along as the best musical numbers should. The only personal criticism I could make for this film is that I would have liked to see this film go even darker. The reason for that is because the storytellers here did such a good job at taking a story with adult subject matter and churning it into something palatable for kids. They did so well in fact that I would have edited out the parts with the gargoyles and the slapstick moments since they're basically more dramatically distracting than helpful to the plot. I think had the gargoyles and slapstick stuff that was meant to appeal to the kids been taken out, The Hunchback of Notre Dame would easily rank as one of the finest pictures ever put out by Disney. As it is though, the criticisms wouldn't matter too much since I already think that this is Disney's most underrated animated feature since Alice in Wonderland (1951). In addition to being a visual marvel to feast my eyes on and a pleasure to listen to with such killer songs such as the ones I've stated before, The Hunchback of Notre Dame does an exceptional job at teaching kids the importance of tolerating people of a different culture, religion, race, and visual appearance. This is a remarkable achievement, one of the studio's finest.

    Let me say that this is one of my FAVORITE MOVIES EVER! <3 And I think it is a SUPER underrated Disney film.I've heard some people say that the songs are weak compared to the songs in more acclaimed Disney films like Aladdin or The Little Mermaid.I TOTALLY disagree.I think the opening song is VERY powerful and God Help the Outcasts was simply beautiful and worked wonderful with Esmeralda's voice.Heaven's Light was a really beautiful and bittersweet song(bittersweet because we know what happens later)And the Hell Fire sequence was freaking EPIC.And am I the only one that found the gargoyle's song catchy and not annoying?Anyway,I also thought the score was AMAZING.I mean just listen to how powerful it sounds.It's all FSDUHAGAJBAMGK(that means amazingly powerful.)From the beginning by just hearing the music you can already tell the movie is going to be epic! Let's move on with the characters!I love the characters in this movie!Quasimodo is plain out lovable.I don't see how you can dislike such a sweet character.He is also a strong character who truly cares about Esmeralda,even when she does break his heart he still helps her because he truly cared about her.Phoebes is funny and I love his attitude and the way he stood for what was right even though there were consequences for him.And Esmeralda is an awesome heroine!I also love how she stands up for what is right and rebels.She's so kind and sly too.I didn't think the Gargoyles were annoying,I actually kinda liked them.I can't decide if the movie would be better without their comic relief or not though.However,the comic relief didn't ruin the tone of the film so that's good.As for the villain,Frollo was awesome!I loved his personality and sinisterness(is that a word?)And he is different than all the other Disney villains.He wasn't just out for power and he wasn't evil simply because he liked being evil.He actually thought everything he did was for God so that's really unique in terms of Disney villainy....And Frollo was just plain out awesome. The animation in this movie is beautiful.(well this is Disney,it's not like it would have crappy animation)I really wish Disney would make more beautiful hand drawn animated movies.The computer animation for the backgrounds and what not blended in well without looking cheezy.I love the vibrant colors and wonderful detailed backgrounds,especially in the cathedral. I thought this was a wonderful adaption to a rather grim story.A lot of changes were made to make the film more suitable for children but I give Disney credit for not totally screwing up the story and still keeping some of the more mature elements instead of making it all kiddy kiddy.Yes,it's a Disney film and it's still meant for children so they took out the more brutal things and gave it a ''the good guys live happily ever after'' ending but I'm glad they at least didn't keep the ending TOTALLY perfectly happy(poor Quasi not getting Esmeralda)I recommend this film to all children,animation buffs,or anyone who likes a good family movie ^.^ 10 out of 10 stars!Thanks for reading,my kitties!ღ

    I'm sorry, but I am a Disney fanatic, freak, whatever you want to call it and I cannot stand this movie. This is the one time Disney has failed in my eyes. I don't see why anyone would like this movie. And it's not because the main character is fugly and gross, it's because of the end. I thought it sent a terrible message to kids. The guy totally falls in love with Esmeralda, goes out of his way (I mean above and beyond the call of duty) to rescue her and be the good guy to prove his love for her...and she ends up with the handsome one?! What kind of message is that? To me that is Disney saying "the hot girl belongs with the hot guy and the fugly hero can never have true love". I don't know if this movie is based off a book or a true story, so if that is the case then I could kind of forgive it...but if not, Disney made a huge mistake. There are some good songs, the villain is very easy to hate, and the handsome soldier guy does provide some comedy relief along with the gargoyles, but other than that movie pretty much sucks.

    Considered as Disney's one of darkest films of all times, Hunchback of Notre Dame is still one of my most favorite masterpiece Disney has created (the other one being Beauty and the Beast). The songs, unlike what other reviewers said, were fantastic. I mean, compared to the likes of Lion King and Little Mermaid, the songs weren't for the children, but it's so moving and wonderful. Plus the orchestration and the score, Menken totally deserved the Oscar for that. It's so sad that this is considered one of Disney's most underrated film. Anyways, I'm really looking forward to see this on Broadway (there've been rumors), and I know that this will succeed on Broadway because the songs and the story for that matter is really Broadway's, if you know what I mean... All in all, great film nevertheless..

    In 15th century Paris, Quasimodo the hunchback of Notre Dame falls for gypsy girl Esmeralda who was the only one to show him kindness. Claude Frollo the Minister of Justice has kept Quasimodo hidden in the belltower. The cruel Frollo set his soldiers to destroy the world of the gypsy and it's up to Quasimodo and the handsome Phoebus to come to the rescue. This Disney animation looks great. The story is a beautiful poignant story of sacrifice and love. The only thing missing is a really good iconic song. That would have added at least a point. The characters are really compelling.

    The Hunchback of Notre Dame was a film I never saw as a child. For some reason, my parents didn't own it and I remember watching the typical films like The Lion King, The Little Mermaid and many princess type films as I was a typical girly girl. I've gotten into a Disney obsession, wanting to watch all the Disney movies and I one I desperately wanted to see was The Hunchback of Notre Dame, after seeing praising reviews and friends saying it was a very fabulous film. So, is it any good? The Hunchback of Notre Dame sets in 15th century, France and tells the story of the bellringer, Quasimodo who lives in the belltower. After Judge Claude Frollo killed his mother and father when Quasi was a baby, the Archdeacon convinces him to raise as him as his son. 20 years later, another year has passed and it's time for Quasi's favourite past-time, watching the Feast of Fools. Desperately wanting to go, he leaves the bell tower, but to be shamed and humiliated in front of the crowd due to his disfigured look until Esmeralda, a kind gypsy, saves him. Meanwhile, Frollo is trying to get rid of the gypsies, especially Esmeralda and is desperately wanting to get rid of her. I'll stop the main plot here. The movie is absolutely amazing. From the start, I was sitting on the edge of my seat in awe. The animation is smooth and it's at Disney's finest. The colours and themes mix together so well, and it makes the film look beautiful! The songs are perfect. I honestly believe it has the best sound-track out of any Disney film I have ever seen and trust me, I'm a huge fan of Disney. From the choirs, to the echoing instrument, all of the music is absolutely beautiful. I've even downloaded some on my iPod because the songs give me chills every time. The characters are very likable and Frollo has become my favourite Disney villain. He is the most evilest villain I have ever seen! Esmeralda has become my favourite Disney girl. She's so strong, tough and absolutely kind, a great role model for children and adults alike. Quasi is so kind and such a great character, they nailed him perfectly and I defiantly expected for him to be like what he is in the movie before watching it. Is it for kids? The truth is, it is one of Disney's darkest films, I honestly believe it's the darkest. With themes like murder, sex and more, this may not be suitable for children. Possibly 9 and up. If you're an over-protective parent, maybe keep the movie until they're a bit older. Some children may get confused at the plot, but I'm sure they'll enjoy it anyway. If you're watching it with your child, I'm sure you'll love it too. It's an absolute favourite of mine and I know parents will love it!

    This has got to be one of my least favorite Disney Films. It support's a weak script, un- necessary characters, and has a poor over all message. This film didn't take the books material to best use. This could have been stretched out further, and half of the screen time is spent on the lesser characters. Quasimodo should have had more screen time. The voice work and villain are top notch and so is the animation but everything else is a total disaster. The villain gets very little screen time but when he does get screen time it's dark, and suspenseful. Tom Hulce and Tony Jay support excellent voice work as their characters.The voice work is deep, provoking, original, and emotionally depth. Overall this is a very disappointing Disney Animated Film.

    When I see a Disney animated I look for 3 things, just 3 simple things, the original songs, the humor, and the theme. I think that this movie failed miserably at all of these. First, the songs. They're not original, as most of them tried to be something that has happen in other Disney's classics already. For example in Quasimodo's love song, I can hear the chemistry - the beat sort of - from Be Our Guest running. The songs aren't original. Second, the humor. The only gags are slapstick and not even the good kind. Their humor is cheap, just lots of guys getting hit in the balls. The best of all the humor is probably the 3 stone stooges, which is no where near its past, like Lumiere and co. Last, the theme. Disney movies are supposed to have a simple and just purely good theme. Let's say Beauty and the Beast's redemption from evil, or Pocahontas's love can overcome anything, this movie is no where match. The theme is what, religion and hellfire. I call that bullsh-t. In summary, this is no where near anything Disney has ever done and is terrible at being a Disney family everyone loved.

In addition to being a visual marvel to feast my eyes on and a pleasure to listen to with such killer songs such as the ones I've stated before, The Hunchback of Notre Dame does an exceptional job at teaching kids the importance of tolerating people of a different culture, religion, race, and visual appearance. This is a remarkable achievement, one of the studio's finest.

    Let me say that this is one of my FAVORITE MOVIES EVER! <3 And I think it is a SUPER underrated Disney film.I've heard some people say that the songs are weak compared to the songs in more acclaimed Disney films like Aladdin or The Little Mermaid.I TOTALLY disagree.I think the opening song is VERY powerful and God Help the Outcasts was simply beautiful and worked wonderful with Esmeralda's voice.Heaven's Light was a really beautiful and bittersweet song(bittersweet because we know what happens later)And the Hell Fire sequence was freaking EPIC.And am I the only one that found the gargoyle's song catchy and not annoying?Anyway,I also thought the score was AMAZING.I mean just listen to how powerful it sounds.It's all FSDUHAGAJBAMGK(that means amazingly powerful.)From the beginning by just hearing the music you can already tell the movie is going to be epic! Let's move on with the characters!I love the characters in this movie!Quasimodo is plain out lovable.I don't see how you can dislike such a sweet character.He is also a strong character who truly cares about Esmeralda,even when she does break his heart he still helps her because he truly cared about her.Phoebes is funny and I love his attitude and the way he stood for what was right even though there were consequences for him.And Esmeralda is an awesome heroine!I also love how she stands up for what is right and rebels.She's so kind and sly too.I didn't think the Gargoyles were annoying,I actually kinda liked them.I can't decide if the movie would be better without their comic relief or not though.However,the comic relief didn't ruin the tone of the film so that's good.As for the villain,Frollo was awesome!I loved his personality and sinisterness(is that a word?)And he is different than all the other Disney villains.He wasn't just out for power and he wasn't evil simply because he liked being evil.He actually thought everything he did was for God so that's really unique in terms of Disney villainy....And Frollo was just plain out awesome. The animation in this movie is beautiful.(well this is Disney,it's not like it would have crappy animation)I really wish Disney would make more beautiful hand drawn animated movies.The computer animation for the backgrounds and what not blended in well without looking cheezy.I love the vibrant colors and wonderful detailed backgrounds,especially in the cathedral. I thought this was a wonderful adaption to a rather grim story.A lot of changes were made to make the film more suitable for children but I give Disney credit for not totally screwing up the story and still keeping some of the more mature elements instead of making it all kiddy kiddy.Yes,it's a Disney film and it's still meant for children so they took out the more brutal things and gave it a ''the good guys live happily ever after'' ending but I'm glad they at least didn't keep the ending TOTALLY perfectly happy(poor Quasi not getting Esmeralda)I recommend this film to all children,animation buffs,or anyone who likes a good family movie ^.^ 10 out of 10 stars!Thanks for reading,my kitties!ღ

    I'm sorry, but I am a Disney fanatic, freak, whatever you want to call it and I cannot stand this movie. This is the one time Disney has failed in my eyes. I don't see why anyone would like this movie. And it's not because the main character is fugly and gross, it's because of the end. I thought it sent a terrible message to kids. The guy totally falls in love with Esmeralda, goes out of his way (I mean above and beyond the call of duty) to rescue her and be the good guy to prove his love for her...and she ends up with the handsome one?! What kind of message is that? To me that is Disney saying "the hot girl belongs with the hot guy and the fugly hero can never have true love". I don't know if this movie is based off a book or a true story, so if that is the case then I could kind of forgive it...but if not, Disney made a huge mistake. There are some good songs, the villain is very easy to hate, and the handsome soldier guy does provide some comedy relief along with the gargoyles, but other than that movie pretty much sucks.

    Considered as Disney's one of darkest films of all times, Hunchback of Notre Dame is still one of my most favorite masterpiece Disney has created (the other one being Beauty and the Beast). The songs, unlike what other reviewers said, were fantastic. I mean, compared to the likes of Lion King and Little Mermaid, the songs weren't for the children, but it's so moving and wonderful. Plus the orchestration and the score, Menken totally deserved the Oscar for that. It's so sad that this is considered one of Disney's most underrated film. Anyways, I'm really looking forward to see this on Broadway (there've been rumors), and I know that this will succeed on Broadway because the songs and the story for that matter is really Broadway's, if you know what I mean... All in all, great film nevertheless..

    In 15th century Paris, Quasimodo the hunchback of Notre Dame falls for gypsy girl Esmeralda who was the only one to show him kindness. Claude Frollo the Minister of Justice has kept Quasimodo hidden in the belltower. The cruel Frollo set his soldiers to destroy the world of the gypsy and it's up to Quasimodo and the handsome Phoebus to come to the rescue. This Disney animation looks great. The story is a beautiful poignant story of sacrifice and love. The only thing missing is a really good iconic song. That would have added at least a point. The characters are really compelling.

    The Hunchback of Notre Dame was a film I never saw as a child. For some reason, my parents didn't own it and I remember watching the typical films like The Lion King, The Little Mermaid and many princess type films as I was a typical girly girl. I've gotten into a Disney obsession, wanting to watch all the Disney movies and I one I desperately wanted to see was The Hunchback of Notre Dame, after seeing praising reviews and friends saying it was a very fabulous film. So, is it any good? The Hunchback of Notre Dame sets in 15th century, France and tells the story of the bellringer, Quasimodo who lives in the belltower. After Judge Claude Frollo killed his mother and father when Quasi was a baby, the Archdeacon convinces him to raise as him as his son. 20 years later, another year has passed and it's time for Quasi's favourite past-time, watching the Feast of Fools. Desperately wanting to go, he leaves the bell tower, but to be shamed and humiliated in front of the crowd due to his disfigured look until Esmeralda, a kind gypsy, saves him. Meanwhile, Frollo is trying to get rid of the gypsies, especially Esmeralda and is desperately wanting to get rid of her. I'll stop the main plot here. The movie is absolutely amazing. From the start, I was sitting on the edge of my seat in awe. The animation is smooth and it's at Disney's finest. The colours and themes mix together so well, and it makes the film look beautiful! The songs are perfect. I honestly believe it has the best sound-track out of any Disney film I have ever seen and trust me, I'm a huge fan of Disney. From the choirs, to the echoing instrument, all of the music is absolutely beautiful. I've even downloaded some on my iPod because the songs give me chills every time. The characters are very likable and Frollo has become my favourite Disney villain. He is the most evilest villain I have ever seen! Esmeralda has become my favourite Disney girl. She's so strong, tough and absolutely kind, a great role model for children and adults alike. Quasi is so kind and such a great character, they nailed him perfectly and I defiantly expected for him to be like what he is in the movie before watching it. Is it for kids? The truth is, it is one of Disney's darkest films, I honestly believe it's the darkest. With themes like murder, sex and more, this may not be suitable for children. Possibly 9 and up. If you're an over-protective parent, maybe keep the movie until they're a bit older. Some children may get confused at the plot, but I'm sure they'll enjoy it anyway. If you're watching it with your child, I'm sure you'll love it too. It's an absolute favourite of mine and I know parents will love it!

    This has got to be one of my least favorite Disney Films. It support's a weak script, un- necessary characters, and has a poor over all message. This film didn't take the books material to best use. This could have been stretched out further, and half of the screen time is spent on the lesser characters. Quasimodo should have had more screen time. The voice work and villain are top notch and so is the animation but everything else is a total disaster. The villain gets very little screen time but when he does get screen time it's dark, and suspenseful. Tom Hulce and Tony Jay support excellent voice work as their characters.The voice work is deep, provoking, original, and emotionally depth. Overall this is a very disappointing Disney Animated Film.

    When I see a Disney animated I look for 3 things, just 3 simple things, the original songs, the humor, and the theme. I think that this movie failed miserably at all of these. First, the songs. They're not original, as most of them tried to be something that has happen in other Disney's classics already. For example in Quasimodo's love song, I can hear the chemistry - the beat sort of - from Be Our Guest running. The songs aren't original. Second, the humor. The only gags are slapstick and not even the good kind. Their humor is cheap, just lots of guys getting hit in the balls. The best of all the humor is probably the 3 stone stooges, which is no where near its past, like Lumiere and co. Last, the theme. Disney movies are supposed to have a simple and just purely good theme. Let's say Beauty and the Beast's redemption from evil, or Pocahontas's love can overcome anything, this movie is no where match. The theme is what, religion and hellfire. I call that bullsh-t. In summary, this is no where near anything Disney has ever done and is terrible at being a Disney family everyone loved.

    Mixed Feelings About This Movie For Kids...

    When this movie came out, I eventually saw it with some of my friends, and though my mother watched it as well, she never added it to our Disney movie library. I always wondered why not, because I loved the music. Now that I am a parent myself and recently watched this again, I understand. There are several pros and cons to this movie, so I will try to outline what I think of it. Pros: Amazing animation and wonderful songs. Also, most of the voice casting is excellent (including the late Mary Wicks as one of the gargoyles). The songs are both memorable and well-written, and the animation is breathtaking! Cons: Now, for an adult, this film has nothing scandalous or inappropriate, however, for a child, I don't agree. The very sexual nature of Esmeralda, from her dancing to her being lusted after by the judge, is definitely not kid-friendly. I mean, why is there all of this sexual tension in a kids movie? Also, the movie is nearly nothing like the book (which is a classic!). However, the book is rather dark, so I can understand lightening it up for kids. But, overall, this movie is rather dark, scary, and a bit too sexual for my tastes (at least for younger children). Overall, this movie has many pros and several cons. My daughter is 4, so she doesn't notice the cons as much (though she definitely prefers the lighter Disney movies like Mary Poppins and Cinderella), but I don't think I am comfortable letting her watch this movie a whole lot. To me, it is not the kind of Disney movie that I am a big fan of, though there are parts about it that I love! All in all, it's up to each parent to decide about this movie, but I would advise to let your kids be a bit older before letting them watch this one!

    As you can probably tell from the summary that this movie isn't that fit for kids. Yet, I still find it to be one of the most underrated films of all time. Why? Well for starters Disney took A LOT of risk with this movie. Instead of making it bright, colorful, and family friendly, "Hunchback" is dark, a little disturbing, and surprisingly has a lot of mature themes. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story. It's about a disfigured man named Quasimodo who lives on top of the bell towers of Notre Damme for all his life because according to his master, Claude Frollo, his "kind" is not welcomed in the streets of Paris and therefore he must spend the rest of his life isolated at the bells of Notre Damme. that's all I'm gonna reveal because I really don't want to spoil the film for you because despite being different from all the other Disney films, I think that "Hunchback of Notre Damme" is magnificent. I like to think of it as the "Dark Knight" of Disney films. Remember when "The Dark Knight" came out? Audiences were so shocked yet so blown away at how dark, gripping, emotional, and complex it was compared to other superhero movies. And it's no surprise that it's often credited as one of the greatest movies ever made today. But why do a lot of people hate Hunchback so much? It did the same thing "the Dark Knight" did, hell it even came out before the "Dark Knight". Why is it forgotten? Well, maybe it's because it's a Disney Movie. Maybe people were tired of the way superheroes were and were happy with the changes that "Dark Knight" gave. When people watch a Disney movie, they expect a colorful movie that's fit for the family. Not a dark film about a disfigured man that is shunned from society. You expect that from Tim Burton, not Disney. Yet again, being different isn't always bad. Just like this movie. I'll admit, I didn't like Hunchback that much as a kid either, and it wasn't until a more recent viewing that I come to respect it. On top of that, this movie arguably offered one of the greatest Disney villains of all time. (watch the movie to find out who it is). He's complex, menacing, and just pure evil. The things he does in the movie is unlike anything any other Disney villain has done before. What about the songs? For the most part, the songs were pretty good, great actually. Particularly the opening and the villain song "Hellfire". So overall, I say go check it out. It's definitely not for everybody, but if you're looking for something different or if you like a movie with a little dark twist, then you should definitely go see it. Just make sure you don't show your kids.

    Disney does have a history of producing some dark films in the past. The Black Cauldron (1985) was the first Disney animated feature to be given a PG rating by the MPAA for a reason. Disney has also had a history of showing young audiences some scary stuff in the past. Remember the evil queen's beggar disguise in Snow White or the "Night on Bald Mountain" sequence in Fantasia or even the pink elephants scene from Dumbo? Those scenes were memorably creepy. Disney has basically made some dark stuff in the past before. But arguably, the darkest and most adult film the Disney Company has produced so far would have to be their 34th full- length animated feature, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Think of this movie as a darker and more complex version of Cinderella (1950). It tells the story of a deformed person named Quasimodo (Tom Hulce) who is forced to stay in the bell tower of Notre Dame by his evil guardian, Frollo (Tony Jay). His only friends are three gargoyles who come to life when no one else is around. One day, Quasimodo goes out of the bell tower to go to the Festival of Fools, a celebration of all kinds of misfits, against Frollo's wishes. When Frollo's guards publicly humiliate Quasimodo in the middle of the festival, a gypsy named Esmeralda (Demi Moore) comes to his defense just as Frollo orders for her to be arrested. But luckily, Esmeralda escapes using her magic tricks that are considered illegal. Now, Frollo is on the hunt for Esmeralda determined to "put her to justice" (I put quotations around that since she really didn't do anything wrong per se). Little does Frollo know that Esmeralda has befriended Quasimodo and (as Frollo would put it) "cast him under a spell" of sorts meaning she teaches Quasimodo that it's okay to be different and that gypsies aren't bad people like Frollo claims that they are. Frollo's Captain of the Guard, Phoebus also befriends these two secretly through other various circumstances since he does not approve of the actions committed by Frollo. Will these three be able to put an end to Frollo's madness or fail? I believe that the most fascinating character in The Hunchback of Notre Dame has got to be the main antagonist, Frollo. Without question, I would easily consider Frollo one of the most complex, adult characters ever concocted by Disney. I personally find it brilliant that he always tries to justify any crimes he commits by claiming that it's all part of God's plan. I also find it clever that he thinks Esmeralda has put a spell on him since he has two intriguing and assuredly sinister plans lined up for when he captures her. He will either burn her at the stake so he can be "cured" of this spell he claims he's under or force her to become romantically involved with him to cure his underlying lust for her. You wouldn't think that this is a Disney flick I'm talking about just based on how I'm describing him, but to be honest, that's why I think he's such a special villain. The drawing and animation in The Hunchback of Notre Dame is simply sensational. The environments that are brought to life in this film really do feel epic because of the scope and detail of the animation. Much like Beauty and the Beast (1991) before it, one needs to simply look at the film first hand in able to truly appreciate the skilled craft and expertise that was put into the film's animation. The music is also spectacular, praise in particular goes to the strong work of the choir for again making everything happening on screen feel so epic in scope. The best songs in this film have got to be "Hellfire" and "The Bells of Notre Dame" because they really do have that elegant and epic quality to them. In addition to that, these songs keep the story moving along as the best musical numbers should. The only personal criticism I could make for this film is that I would have liked to see this film go even darker. The reason for that is because the storytellers here did such a good job at taking a story with adult subject matter and churning it into something palatable for kids. They did so well in fact that I would have edited out the parts with the gargoyles and the slapstick moments since they're basically more dramatically distracting than helpful to the plot. I think had the gargoyles and slapstick stuff that was meant to appeal to the kids been taken out, The Hunchback of Notre Dame would easily rank as one of the finest pictures ever put out by Disney. As it is though, the criticisms wouldn't matter too much since I already think that this is Disney's most underrated animated feature since Alice in Wonderland (1951). In addition to being a visual marvel to feast my eyes on and a pleasure to listen to with such killer songs such as the ones I've stated before, The Hunchback of Notre Dame does an exceptional job at teaching kids the importance of tolerating people of a different culture, religion, race, and visual appearance. This is a remarkable achievement, one of the studio's finest.

She's so strong, tough and absolutely kind, a great role model for children and adults alike. Quasi is so kind and such a great character, they nailed him perfectly and I defiantly expected for him to be like what he is in the movie before watching it. Is it for kids? The truth is, it is one of Disney's darkest films, I honestly believe it's the darkest. With themes like murder, sex and more, this may not be suitable for children. Possibly 9 and up. If you're an over-protective parent, maybe keep the movie until they're a bit older. Some children may get confused at the plot, but I'm sure they'll enjoy it anyway. If you're watching it with your child, I'm sure you'll love it too. It's an absolute favourite of mine and I know parents will love it!

    This has got to be one of my least favorite Disney Films. It support's a weak script, un- necessary characters, and has a poor over all message. This film didn't take the books material to best use. This could have been stretched out further, and half of the screen time is spent on the lesser characters. Quasimodo should have had more screen time. The voice work and villain are top notch and so is the animation but everything else is a total disaster. The villain gets very little screen time but when he does get screen time it's dark, and suspenseful. Tom Hulce and Tony Jay support excellent voice work as their characters.The voice work is deep, provoking, original, and emotionally depth. Overall this is a very disappointing Disney Animated Film.

    When I see a Disney animated I look for 3 things, just 3 simple things, the original songs, the humor, and the theme. I think that this movie failed miserably at all of these. First, the songs. They're not original, as most of them tried to be something that has happen in other Disney's classics already. For example in Quasimodo's love song, I can hear the chemistry - the beat sort of - from Be Our Guest running. The songs aren't original. Second, the humor. The only gags are slapstick and not even the good kind. Their humor is cheap, just lots of guys getting hit in the balls. The best of all the humor is probably the 3 stone stooges, which is no where near its past, like Lumiere and co. Last, the theme. Disney movies are supposed to have a simple and just purely good theme. Let's say Beauty and the Beast's redemption from evil, or Pocahontas's love can overcome anything, this movie is no where match. The theme is what, religion and hellfire. I call that bullsh-t. In summary, this is no where near anything Disney has ever done and is terrible at being a Disney family everyone loved.

    When this movie came out, I eventually saw it with some of my friends, and though my mother watched it as well, she never added it to our Disney movie library. I always wondered why not, because I loved the music. Now that I am a parent myself and recently watched this again, I understand. There are several pros and cons to this movie, so I will try to outline what I think of it. Pros: Amazing animation and wonderful songs. Also, most of the voice casting is excellent (including the late Mary Wicks as one of the gargoyles). The songs are both memorable and well-written, and the animation is breathtaking! Cons: Now, for an adult, this film has nothing scandalous or inappropriate, however, for a child, I don't agree. The very sexual nature of Esmeralda, from her dancing to her being lusted after by the judge, is definitely not kid-friendly. I mean, why is there all of this sexual tension in a kids movie? Also, the movie is nearly nothing like the book (which is a classic!). However, the book is rather dark, so I can understand lightening it up for kids. But, overall, this movie is rather dark, scary, and a bit too sexual for my tastes (at least for younger children). Overall, this movie has many pros and several cons. My daughter is 4, so she doesn't notice the cons as much (though she definitely prefers the lighter Disney movies like Mary Poppins and Cinderella), but I don't think I am comfortable letting her watch this movie a whole lot. To me, it is not the kind of Disney movie that I am a big fan of, though there are parts about it that I love! All in all, it's up to each parent to decide about this movie, but I would advise to let your kids be a bit older before letting them watch this one!

    As you can probably tell from the summary that this movie isn't that fit for kids. Yet, I still find it to be one of the most underrated films of all time. Why? Well for starters Disney took A LOT of risk with this movie. Instead of making it bright, colorful, and family friendly, "Hunchback" is dark, a little disturbing, and surprisingly has a lot of mature themes. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story. It's about a disfigured man named Quasimodo who lives on top of the bell towers of Notre Damme for all his life because according to his master, Claude Frollo, his "kind" is not welcomed in the streets of Paris and therefore he must spend the rest of his life isolated at the bells of Notre Damme. that's all I'm gonna reveal because I really don't want to spoil the film for you because despite being different from all the other Disney films, I think that "Hunchback of Notre Damme" is magnificent. I like to think of it as the "Dark Knight" of Disney films. Remember when "The Dark Knight" came out? Audiences were so shocked yet so blown away at how dark, gripping, emotional, and complex it was compared to other superhero movies. And it's no surprise that it's often credited as one of the greatest movies ever made today. But why do a lot of people hate Hunchback so much? It did the same thing "the Dark Knight" did, hell it even came out before the "Dark Knight". Why is it forgotten? Well, maybe it's because it's a Disney Movie. Maybe people were tired of the way superheroes were and were happy with the changes that "Dark Knight" gave. When people watch a Disney movie, they expect a colorful movie that's fit for the family. Not a dark film about a disfigured man that is shunned from society. You expect that from Tim Burton, not Disney. Yet again, being different isn't always bad. Just like this movie. I'll admit, I didn't like Hunchback that much as a kid either, and it wasn't until a more recent viewing that I come to respect it. On top of that, this movie arguably offered one of the greatest Disney villains of all time. (watch the movie to find out who it is). He's complex, menacing, and just pure evil. The things he does in the movie is unlike anything any other Disney villain has done before. What about the songs? For the most part, the songs were pretty good, great actually. Particularly the opening and the villain song "Hellfire". So overall, I say go check it out. It's definitely not for everybody, but if you're looking for something different or if you like a movie with a little dark twist, then you should definitely go see it. Just make sure you don't show your kids.

    Disney does have a history of producing some dark films in the past. The Black Cauldron (1985) was the first Disney animated feature to be given a PG rating by the MPAA for a reason. Disney has also had a history of showing young audiences some scary stuff in the past. Remember the evil queen's beggar disguise in Snow White or the "Night on Bald Mountain" sequence in Fantasia or even the pink elephants scene from Dumbo? Those scenes were memorably creepy. Disney has basically made some dark stuff in the past before. But arguably, the darkest and most adult film the Disney Company has produced so far would have to be their 34th full- length animated feature, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Think of this movie as a darker and more complex version of Cinderella (1950). It tells the story of a deformed person named Quasimodo (Tom Hulce) who is forced to stay in the bell tower of Notre Dame by his evil guardian, Frollo (Tony Jay). His only friends are three gargoyles who come to life when no one else is around. One day, Quasimodo goes out of the bell tower to go to the Festival of Fools, a celebration of all kinds of misfits, against Frollo's wishes. When Frollo's guards publicly humiliate Quasimodo in the middle of the festival, a gypsy named Esmeralda (Demi Moore) comes to his defense just as Frollo orders for her to be arrested. But luckily, Esmeralda escapes using her magic tricks that are considered illegal. Now, Frollo is on the hunt for Esmeralda determined to "put her to justice" (I put quotations around that since she really didn't do anything wrong per se). Little does Frollo know that Esmeralda has befriended Quasimodo and (as Frollo would put it) "cast him under a spell" of sorts meaning she teaches Quasimodo that it's okay to be different and that gypsies aren't bad people like Frollo claims that they are. Frollo's Captain of the Guard, Phoebus also befriends these two secretly through other various circumstances since he does not approve of the actions committed by Frollo. Will these three be able to put an end to Frollo's madness or fail? I believe that the most fascinating character in The Hunchback of Notre Dame has got to be the main antagonist, Frollo. Without question, I would easily consider Frollo one of the most complex, adult characters ever concocted by Disney. I personally find it brilliant that he always tries to justify any crimes he commits by claiming that it's all part of God's plan. I also find it clever that he thinks Esmeralda has put a spell on him since he has two intriguing and assuredly sinister plans lined up for when he captures her. He will either burn her at the stake so he can be "cured" of this spell he claims he's under or force her to become romantically involved with him to cure his underlying lust for her. You wouldn't think that this is a Disney flick I'm talking about just based on how I'm describing him, but to be honest, that's why I think he's such a special villain. The drawing and animation in The Hunchback of Notre Dame is simply sensational. The environments that are brought to life in this film really do feel epic because of the scope and detail of the animation. Much like Beauty and the Beast (1991) before it, one needs to simply look at the film first hand in able to truly appreciate the skilled craft and expertise that was put into the film's animation. The music is also spectacular, praise in particular goes to the strong work of the choir for again making everything happening on screen feel so epic in scope. The best songs in this film have got to be "Hellfire" and "The Bells of Notre Dame" because they really do have that elegant and epic quality to them. In addition to that, these songs keep the story moving along as the best musical numbers should. The only personal criticism I could make for this film is that I would have liked to see this film go even darker. The reason for that is because the storytellers here did such a good job at taking a story with adult subject matter and churning it into something palatable for kids. They did so well in fact that I would have edited out the parts with the gargoyles and the slapstick moments since they're basically more dramatically distracting than helpful to the plot. I think had the gargoyles and slapstick stuff that was meant to appeal to the kids been taken out, The Hunchback of Notre Dame would easily rank as one of the finest pictures ever put out by Disney. As it is though, the criticisms wouldn't matter too much since I already think that this is Disney's most underrated animated feature since Alice in Wonderland (1951). In addition to being a visual marvel to feast my eyes on and a pleasure to listen to with such killer songs such as the ones I've stated before, The Hunchback of Notre Dame does an exceptional job at teaching kids the importance of tolerating people of a different culture, religion, race, and visual appearance. This is a remarkable achievement, one of the studio's finest.

    Let me say that this is one of my FAVORITE MOVIES EVER! <3 And I think it is a SUPER underrated Disney film.I've heard some people say that the songs are weak compared to the songs in more acclaimed Disney films like Aladdin or The Little Mermaid.I TOTALLY disagree.I think the opening song is VERY powerful and God Help the Outcasts was simply beautiful and worked wonderful with Esmeralda's voice.Heaven's Light was a really beautiful and bittersweet song(bittersweet because we know what happens later)And the Hell Fire sequence was freaking EPIC.And am I the only one that found the gargoyle's song catchy and not annoying?Anyway,I also thought the score was AMAZING.I mean just listen to how powerful it sounds.It's all FSDUHAGAJBAMGK(that means amazingly powerful.)From the beginning by just hearing the music you can already tell the movie is going to be epic! Let's move on with the characters!I love the characters in this movie!Quasimodo is plain out lovable.I don't see how you can dislike such a sweet character.He is also a strong character who truly cares about Esmeralda,even when she does break his heart he still helps her because he truly cared about her.Phoebes is funny and I love his attitude and the way he stood for what was right even though there were consequences for him.And Esmeralda is an awesome heroine!I also love how she stands up for what is right and rebels.She's so kind and sly too.I didn't think the Gargoyles were annoying,I actually kinda liked them.I can't decide if the movie would be better without their comic relief or not though.However,the comic relief didn't ruin the tone of the film so that's good.As for the villain,Frollo was awesome!I loved his personality and sinisterness(is that a word?)And he is different than all the other Disney villains.He wasn't just out for power and he wasn't evil simply because he liked being evil.He actually thought everything he did was for God so that's really unique in terms of Disney villainy....And Frollo was just plain out awesome. The animation in this movie is beautiful.(well this is Disney,it's not like it would have crappy animation)I really wish Disney would make more beautiful hand drawn animated movies.The computer animation for the backgrounds and what not blended in well without looking cheezy.I love the vibrant colors and wonderful detailed backgrounds,especially in the cathedral. I thought this was a wonderful adaption to a rather grim story.A lot of changes were made to make the film more suitable for children but I give Disney credit for not totally screwing up the story and still keeping some of the more mature elements instead of making it all kiddy kiddy.Yes,it's a Disney film and it's still meant for children so they took out the more brutal things and gave it a ''the good guys live happily ever after'' ending but I'm glad they at least didn't keep the ending TOTALLY perfectly happy(poor Quasi not getting Esmeralda)I recommend this film to all children,animation buffs,or anyone who likes a good family movie ^.^ 10 out of 10 stars!Thanks for reading,my kitties!ღ

    I'm sorry, but I am a Disney fanatic, freak, whatever you want to call it and I cannot stand this movie. This is the one time Disney has failed in my eyes. I don't see why anyone would like this movie. And it's not because the main character is fugly and gross, it's because of the end. I thought it sent a terrible message to kids. The guy totally falls in love with Esmeralda, goes out of his way (I mean above and beyond the call of duty) to rescue her and be the good guy to prove his love for her...and she ends up with the handsome one?! What kind of message is that? To me that is Disney saying "the hot girl belongs with the hot guy and the fugly hero can never have true love". I don't know if this movie is based off a book or a true story, so if that is the case then I could kind of forgive it...but if not, Disney made a huge mistake. There are some good songs, the villain is very easy to hate, and the handsome soldier guy does provide some comedy relief along with the gargoyles, but other than that movie pretty much sucks.

    Considered as Disney's one of darkest films of all times, Hunchback of Notre Dame is still one of my most favorite masterpiece Disney has created (the other one being Beauty and the Beast). The songs, unlike what other reviewers said, were fantastic. I mean, compared to the likes of Lion King and Little Mermaid, the songs weren't for the children, but it's so moving and wonderful. Plus the orchestration and the score, Menken totally deserved the Oscar for that. It's so sad that this is considered one of Disney's most underrated film. Anyways, I'm really looking forward to see this on Broadway (there've been rumors), and I know that this will succeed on Broadway because the songs and the story for that matter is really Broadway's, if you know what I mean... All in all, great film nevertheless..

    In 15th century Paris, Quasimodo the hunchback of Notre Dame falls for gypsy girl Esmeralda who was the only one to show him kindness. Claude Frollo the Minister of Justice has kept Quasimodo hidden in the belltower. The cruel Frollo set his soldiers to destroy the world of the gypsy and it's up to Quasimodo and the handsome Phoebus to come to the rescue. This Disney animation looks great. The story is a beautiful poignant story of sacrifice and love. The only thing missing is a really good iconic song. That would have added at least a point. The characters are really compelling.

    The Hunchback of Notre Dame was a film I never saw as a child. For some reason, my parents didn't own it and I remember watching the typical films like The Lion King, The Little Mermaid and many princess type films as I was a typical girly girl. I've gotten into a Disney obsession, wanting to watch all the Disney movies and I one I desperately wanted to see was The Hunchback of Notre Dame, after seeing praising reviews and friends saying it was a very fabulous film. So, is it any good? The Hunchback of Notre Dame sets in 15th century, France and tells the story of the bellringer, Quasimodo who lives in the belltower. After Judge Claude Frollo killed his mother and father when Quasi was a baby, the Archdeacon convinces him to raise as him as his son. 20 years later, another year has passed and it's time for Quasi's favourite past-time, watching the Feast of Fools. Desperately wanting to go, he leaves the bell tower, but to be shamed and humiliated in front of the crowd due to his disfigured look until Esmeralda, a kind gypsy, saves him. Meanwhile, Frollo is trying to get rid of the gypsies, especially Esmeralda and is desperately wanting to get rid of her. I'll stop the main plot here. The movie is absolutely amazing. From the start, I was sitting on the edge of my seat in awe. The animation is smooth and it's at Disney's finest. The colours and themes mix together so well, and it makes the film look beautiful! The songs are perfect. I honestly believe it has the best sound-track out of any Disney film I have ever seen and trust me, I'm a huge fan of Disney. From the choirs, to the echoing instrument, all of the music is absolutely beautiful. I've even downloaded some on my iPod because the songs give me chills every time. The characters are very likable and Frollo has become my favourite Disney villain. He is the most evilest villain I have ever seen! Esmeralda has become my favourite Disney girl. She's so strong, tough and absolutely kind, a great role model for children and adults alike. Quasi is so kind and such a great character, they nailed him perfectly and I defiantly expected for him to be like what he is in the movie before watching it. Is it for kids? The truth is, it is one of Disney's darkest films, I honestly believe it's the darkest. With themes like murder, sex and more, this may not be suitable for children. Possibly 9 and up. If you're an over-protective parent, maybe keep the movie until they're a bit older. Some children may get confused at the plot, but I'm sure they'll enjoy it anyway. If you're watching it with your child, I'm sure you'll love it too. It's an absolute favourite of mine and I know parents will love it!

But arguably, the darkest and most adult film the Disney Company has produced so far would have to be their 34th full- length animated feature, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Think of this movie as a darker and more complex version of Cinderella (1950). It tells the story of a deformed person named Quasimodo (Tom Hulce) who is forced to stay in the bell tower of Notre Dame by his evil guardian, Frollo (Tony Jay). His only friends are three gargoyles who come to life when no one else is around. One day, Quasimodo goes out of the bell tower to go to the Festival of Fools, a celebration of all kinds of misfits, against Frollo's wishes. When Frollo's guards publicly humiliate Quasimodo in the middle of the festival, a gypsy named Esmeralda (Demi Moore) comes to his defense just as Frollo orders for her to be arrested. But luckily, Esmeralda escapes using her magic tricks that are considered illegal. Now, Frollo is on the hunt for Esmeralda determined to "put her to justice" (I put quotations around that since she really didn't do anything wrong per se). Little does Frollo know that Esmeralda has befriended Quasimodo and (as Frollo would put it) "cast him under a spell" of sorts meaning she teaches Quasimodo that it's okay to be different and that gypsies aren't bad people like Frollo claims that they are. Frollo's Captain of the Guard, Phoebus also befriends these two secretly through other various circumstances since he does not approve of the actions committed by Frollo. Will these three be able to put an end to Frollo's madness or fail? I believe that the most fascinating character in The Hunchback of Notre Dame has got to be the main antagonist, Frollo. Without question, I would easily consider Frollo one of the most complex, adult characters ever concocted by Disney. I personally find it brilliant that he always tries to justify any crimes he commits by claiming that it's all part of God's plan. I also find it clever that he thinks Esmeralda has put a spell on him since he has two intriguing and assuredly sinister plans lined up for when he captures her. He will either burn her at the stake so he can be "cured" of this spell he claims he's under or force her to become romantically involved with him to cure his underlying lust for her. You wouldn't think that this is a Disney flick I'm talking about just based on how I'm describing him, but to be honest, that's why I think he's such a special villain. The drawing and animation in The Hunchback of Notre Dame is simply sensational. The environments that are brought to life in this film really do feel epic because of the scope and detail of the animation. Much like Beauty and the Beast (1991) before it, one needs to simply look at the film first hand in able to truly appreciate the skilled craft and expertise that was put into the film's animation. The music is also spectacular, praise in particular goes to the strong work of the choir for again making everything happening on screen feel so epic in scope. The best songs in this film have got to be "Hellfire" and "The Bells of Notre Dame" because they really do have that elegant and epic quality to them. In addition to that, these songs keep the story moving along as the best musical numbers should. The only personal criticism I could make for this film is that I would have liked to see this film go even darker. The reason for that is because the storytellers here did such a good job at taking a story with adult subject matter and churning it into something palatable for kids. They did so well in fact that I would have edited out the parts with the gargoyles and the slapstick moments since they're basically more dramatically distracting than helpful to the plot. I think had the gargoyles and slapstick stuff that was meant to appeal to the kids been taken out, The Hunchback of Notre Dame would easily rank as one of the finest pictures ever put out by Disney. As it is though, the criticisms wouldn't matter too much since I already think that this is Disney's most underrated animated feature since Alice in Wonderland (1951). In addition to being a visual marvel to feast my eyes on and a pleasure to listen to with such killer songs such as the ones I've stated before, The Hunchback of Notre Dame does an exceptional job at teaching kids the importance of tolerating people of a different culture, religion, race, and visual appearance. This is a remarkable achievement, one of the studio's finest.

    Let me say that this is one of my FAVORITE MOVIES EVER! <3 And I think it is a SUPER underrated Disney film.I've heard some people say that the songs are weak compared to the songs in more acclaimed Disney films like Aladdin or The Little Mermaid.I TOTALLY disagree.I think the opening song is VERY powerful and God Help the Outcasts was simply beautiful and worked wonderful with Esmeralda's voice.Heaven's Light was a really beautiful and bittersweet song(bittersweet because we know what happens later)And the Hell Fire sequence was freaking EPIC.And am I the only one that found the gargoyle's song catchy and not annoying?Anyway,I also thought the score was AMAZING.I mean just listen to how powerful it sounds.It's all FSDUHAGAJBAMGK(that means amazingly powerful.)From the beginning by just hearing the music you can already tell the movie is going to be epic! Let's move on with the characters!I love the characters in this movie!Quasimodo is plain out lovable.I don't see how you can dislike such a sweet character.He is also a strong character who truly cares about Esmeralda,even when she does break his heart he still helps her because he truly cared about her.Phoebes is funny and I love his attitude and the way he stood for what was right even though there were consequences for him.And Esmeralda is an awesome heroine!I also love how she stands up for what is right and rebels.She's so kind and sly too.I didn't think the Gargoyles were annoying,I actually kinda liked them.I can't decide if the movie would be better without their comic relief or not though.However,the comic relief didn't ruin the tone of the film so that's good.As for the villain,Frollo was awesome!I loved his personality and sinisterness(is that a word?)And he is different than all the other Disney villains.He wasn't just out for power and he wasn't evil simply because he liked being evil.He actually thought everything he did was for God so that's really unique in terms of Disney villainy....And Frollo was just plain out awesome. The animation in this movie is beautiful.(well this is Disney,it's not like it would have crappy animation)I really wish Disney would make more beautiful hand drawn animated movies.The computer animation for the backgrounds and what not blended in well without looking cheezy.I love the vibrant colors and wonderful detailed backgrounds,especially in the cathedral. I thought this was a wonderful adaption to a rather grim story.A lot of changes were made to make the film more suitable for children but I give Disney credit for not totally screwing up the story and still keeping some of the more mature elements instead of making it all kiddy kiddy.Yes,it's a Disney film and it's still meant for children so they took out the more brutal things and gave it a ''the good guys live happily ever after'' ending but I'm glad they at least didn't keep the ending TOTALLY perfectly happy(poor Quasi not getting Esmeralda)I recommend this film to all children,animation buffs,or anyone who likes a good family movie ^.^ 10 out of 10 stars!Thanks for reading,my kitties!ღ

    I'm sorry, but I am a Disney fanatic, freak, whatever you want to call it and I cannot stand this movie. This is the one time Disney has failed in my eyes. I don't see why anyone would like this movie. And it's not because the main character is fugly and gross, it's because of the end. I thought it sent a terrible message to kids. The guy totally falls in love with Esmeralda, goes out of his way (I mean above and beyond the call of duty) to rescue her and be the good guy to prove his love for her...and she ends up with the handsome one?! What kind of message is that? To me that is Disney saying "the hot girl belongs with the hot guy and the fugly hero can never have true love". I don't know if this movie is based off a book or a true story, so if that is the case then I could kind of forgive it...but if not, Disney made a huge mistake. There are some good songs, the villain is very easy to hate, and the handsome soldier guy does provide some comedy relief along with the gargoyles, but other than that movie pretty much sucks.

    Considered as Disney's one of darkest films of all times, Hunchback of Notre Dame is still one of my most favorite masterpiece Disney has created (the other one being Beauty and the Beast). The songs, unlike what other reviewers said, were fantastic. I mean, compared to the likes of Lion King and Little Mermaid, the songs weren't for the children, but it's so moving and wonderful. Plus the orchestration and the score, Menken totally deserved the Oscar for that. It's so sad that this is considered one of Disney's most underrated film. Anyways, I'm really looking forward to see this on Broadway (there've been rumors), and I know that this will succeed on Broadway because the songs and the story for that matter is really Broadway's, if you know what I mean... All in all, great film nevertheless..

    In 15th century Paris, Quasimodo the hunchback of Notre Dame falls for gypsy girl Esmeralda who was the only one to show him kindness. Claude Frollo the Minister of Justice has kept Quasimodo hidden in the belltower. The cruel Frollo set his soldiers to destroy the world of the gypsy and it's up to Quasimodo and the handsome Phoebus to come to the rescue. This Disney animation looks great. The story is a beautiful poignant story of sacrifice and love. The only thing missing is a really good iconic song. That would have added at least a point. The characters are really compelling.

    The Hunchback of Notre Dame was a film I never saw as a child. For some reason, my parents didn't own it and I remember watching the typical films like The Lion King, The Little Mermaid and many princess type films as I was a typical girly girl. I've gotten into a Disney obsession, wanting to watch all the Disney movies and I one I desperately wanted to see was The Hunchback of Notre Dame, after seeing praising reviews and friends saying it was a very fabulous film. So, is it any good? The Hunchback of Notre Dame sets in 15th century, France and tells the story of the bellringer, Quasimodo who lives in the belltower. After Judge Claude Frollo killed his mother and father when Quasi was a baby, the Archdeacon convinces him to raise as him as his son. 20 years later, another year has passed and it's time for Quasi's favourite past-time, watching the Feast of Fools. Desperately wanting to go, he leaves the bell tower, but to be shamed and humiliated in front of the crowd due to his disfigured look until Esmeralda, a kind gypsy, saves him. Meanwhile, Frollo is trying to get rid of the gypsies, especially Esmeralda and is desperately wanting to get rid of her. I'll stop the main plot here. The movie is absolutely amazing. From the start, I was sitting on the edge of my seat in awe. The animation is smooth and it's at Disney's finest. The colours and themes mix together so well, and it makes the film look beautiful! The songs are perfect. I honestly believe it has the best sound-track out of any Disney film I have ever seen and trust me, I'm a huge fan of Disney. From the choirs, to the echoing instrument, all of the music is absolutely beautiful. I've even downloaded some on my iPod because the songs give me chills every time. The characters are very likable and Frollo has become my favourite Disney villain. He is the most evilest villain I have ever seen! Esmeralda has become my favourite Disney girl. She's so strong, tough and absolutely kind, a great role model for children and adults alike. Quasi is so kind and such a great character, they nailed him perfectly and I defiantly expected for him to be like what he is in the movie before watching it. Is it for kids? The truth is, it is one of Disney's darkest films, I honestly believe it's the darkest. With themes like murder, sex and more, this may not be suitable for children. Possibly 9 and up. If you're an over-protective parent, maybe keep the movie until they're a bit older. Some children may get confused at the plot, but I'm sure they'll enjoy it anyway. If you're watching it with your child, I'm sure you'll love it too. It's an absolute favourite of mine and I know parents will love it!

    This has got to be one of my least favorite Disney Films. It support's a weak script, un- necessary characters, and has a poor over all message. This film didn't take the books material to best use. This could have been stretched out further, and half of the screen time is spent on the lesser characters. Quasimodo should have had more screen time. The voice work and villain are top notch and so is the animation but everything else is a total disaster. The villain gets very little screen time but when he does get screen time it's dark, and suspenseful. Tom Hulce and Tony Jay support excellent voice work as their characters.The voice work is deep, provoking, original, and emotionally depth. Overall this is a very disappointing Disney Animated Film.

    When I see a Disney animated I look for 3 things, just 3 simple things, the original songs, the humor, and the theme. I think that this movie failed miserably at all of these. First, the songs. They're not original, as most of them tried to be something that has happen in other Disney's classics already. For example in Quasimodo's love song, I can hear the chemistry - the beat sort of - from Be Our Guest running. The songs aren't original. Second, the humor. The only gags are slapstick and not even the good kind. Their humor is cheap, just lots of guys getting hit in the balls. The best of all the humor is probably the 3 stone stooges, which is no where near its past, like Lumiere and co. Last, the theme. Disney movies are supposed to have a simple and just purely good theme. Let's say Beauty and the Beast's redemption from evil, or Pocahontas's love can overcome anything, this movie is no where match. The theme is what, religion and hellfire. I call that bullsh-t. In summary, this is no where near anything Disney has ever done and is terrible at being a Disney family everyone loved.

    Mixed Feelings About This Movie For Kids...

    When this movie came out, I eventually saw it with some of my friends, and though my mother watched it as well, she never added it to our Disney movie library. I always wondered why not, because I loved the music. Now that I am a parent myself and recently watched this again, I understand. There are several pros and cons to this movie, so I will try to outline what I think of it. Pros: Amazing animation and wonderful songs. Also, most of the voice casting is excellent (including the late Mary Wicks as one of the gargoyles). The songs are both memorable and well-written, and the animation is breathtaking! Cons: Now, for an adult, this film has nothing scandalous or inappropriate, however, for a child, I don't agree. The very sexual nature of Esmeralda, from her dancing to her being lusted after by the judge, is definitely not kid-friendly. I mean, why is there all of this sexual tension in a kids movie? Also, the movie is nearly nothing like the book (which is a classic!). However, the book is rather dark, so I can understand lightening it up for kids. But, overall, this movie is rather dark, scary, and a bit too sexual for my tastes (at least for younger children). Overall, this movie has many pros and several cons. My daughter is 4, so she doesn't notice the cons as much (though she definitely prefers the lighter Disney movies like Mary Poppins and Cinderella), but I don't think I am comfortable letting her watch this movie a whole lot. To me, it is not the kind of Disney movie that I am a big fan of, though there are parts about it that I love! All in all, it's up to each parent to decide about this movie, but I would advise to let your kids be a bit older before letting them watch this one!

    As you can probably tell from the summary that this movie isn't that fit for kids. Yet, I still find it to be one of the most underrated films of all time. Why? Well for starters Disney took A LOT of risk with this movie. Instead of making it bright, colorful, and family friendly, "Hunchback" is dark, a little disturbing, and surprisingly has a lot of mature themes. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story. It's about a disfigured man named Quasimodo who lives on top of the bell towers of Notre Damme for all his life because according to his master, Claude Frollo, his "kind" is not welcomed in the streets of Paris and therefore he must spend the rest of his life isolated at the bells of Notre Damme. that's all I'm gonna reveal because I really don't want to spoil the film for you because despite being different from all the other Disney films, I think that "Hunchback of Notre Damme" is magnificent. I like to think of it as the "Dark Knight" of Disney films. Remember when "The Dark Knight" came out? Audiences were so shocked yet so blown away at how dark, gripping, emotional, and complex it was compared to other superhero movies. And it's no surprise that it's often credited as one of the greatest movies ever made today. But why do a lot of people hate Hunchback so much? It did the same thing "the Dark Knight" did, hell it even came out before the "Dark Knight". Why is it forgotten? Well, maybe it's because it's a Disney Movie. Maybe people were tired of the way superheroes were and were happy with the changes that "Dark Knight" gave. When people watch a Disney movie, they expect a colorful movie that's fit for the family. Not a dark film about a disfigured man that is shunned from society. You expect that from Tim Burton, not Disney. Yet again, being different isn't always bad. Just like this movie. I'll admit, I didn't like Hunchback that much as a kid either, and it wasn't until a more recent viewing that I come to respect it. On top of that, this movie arguably offered one of the greatest Disney villains of all time. (watch the movie to find out who it is). He's complex, menacing, and just pure evil. The things he does in the movie is unlike anything any other Disney villain has done before. What about the songs? For the most part, the songs were pretty good, great actually. Particularly the opening and the villain song "Hellfire". So overall, I say go check it out. It's definitely not for everybody, but if you're looking for something different or if you like a movie with a little dark twist, then you should definitely go see it. Just make sure you don't show your kids.

    Disney does have a history of producing some dark films in the past. The Black Cauldron (1985) was the first Disney animated feature to be given a PG rating by the MPAA for a reason. Disney has also had a history of showing young audiences some scary stuff in the past. Remember the evil queen's beggar disguise in Snow White or the "Night on Bald Mountain" sequence in Fantasia or even the pink elephants scene from Dumbo? Those scenes were memorably creepy. Disney has basically made some dark stuff in the past before.

The songs, unlike what other reviewers said, were fantastic. I mean, compared to the likes of Lion King and Little Mermaid, the songs weren't for the children, but it's so moving and wonderful. Plus the orchestration and the score, Menken totally deserved the Oscar for that. It's so sad that this is considered one of Disney's most underrated film. Anyways, I'm really looking forward to see this on Broadway (there've been rumors), and I know that this will succeed on Broadway because the songs and the story for that matter is really Broadway's, if you know what I mean... All in all, great film nevertheless..

    In 15th century Paris, Quasimodo the hunchback of Notre Dame falls for gypsy girl Esmeralda who was the only one to show him kindness. Claude Frollo the Minister of Justice has kept Quasimodo hidden in the belltower. The cruel Frollo set his soldiers to destroy the world of the gypsy and it's up to Quasimodo and the handsome Phoebus to come to the rescue. This Disney animation looks great. The story is a beautiful poignant story of sacrifice and love. The only thing missing is a really good iconic song. That would have added at least a point. The characters are really compelling.

    The Hunchback of Notre Dame was a film I never saw as a child. For some reason, my parents didn't own it and I remember watching the typical films like The Lion King, The Little Mermaid and many princess type films as I was a typical girly girl. I've gotten into a Disney obsession, wanting to watch all the Disney movies and I one I desperately wanted to see was The Hunchback of Notre Dame, after seeing praising reviews and friends saying it was a very fabulous film. So, is it any good? The Hunchback of Notre Dame sets in 15th century, France and tells the story of the bellringer, Quasimodo who lives in the belltower. After Judge Claude Frollo killed his mother and father when Quasi was a baby, the Archdeacon convinces him to raise as him as his son. 20 years later, another year has passed and it's time for Quasi's favourite past-time, watching the Feast of Fools. Desperately wanting to go, he leaves the bell tower, but to be shamed and humiliated in front of the crowd due to his disfigured look until Esmeralda, a kind gypsy, saves him. Meanwhile, Frollo is trying to get rid of the gypsies, especially Esmeralda and is desperately wanting to get rid of her. I'll stop the main plot here. The movie is absolutely amazing. From the start, I was sitting on the edge of my seat in awe. The animation is smooth and it's at Disney's finest. The colours and themes mix together so well, and it makes the film look beautiful! The songs are perfect. I honestly believe it has the best sound-track out of any Disney film I have ever seen and trust me, I'm a huge fan of Disney. From the choirs, to the echoing instrument, all of the music is absolutely beautiful. I've even downloaded some on my iPod because the songs give me chills every time. The characters are very likable and Frollo has become my favourite Disney villain. He is the most evilest villain I have ever seen! Esmeralda has become my favourite Disney girl. She's so strong, tough and absolutely kind, a great role model for children and adults alike. Quasi is so kind and such a great character, they nailed him perfectly and I defiantly expected for him to be like what he is in the movie before watching it. Is it for kids? The truth is, it is one of Disney's darkest films, I honestly believe it's the darkest. With themes like murder, sex and more, this may not be suitable for children. Possibly 9 and up. If you're an over-protective parent, maybe keep the movie until they're a bit older. Some children may get confused at the plot, but I'm sure they'll enjoy it anyway. If you're watching it with your child, I'm sure you'll love it too. It's an absolute favourite of mine and I know parents will love it!

    This has got to be one of my least favorite Disney Films. It support's a weak script, un- necessary characters, and has a poor over all message. This film didn't take the books material to best use. This could have been stretched out further, and half of the screen time is spent on the lesser characters. Quasimodo should have had more screen time. The voice work and villain are top notch and so is the animation but everything else is a total disaster. The villain gets very little screen time but when he does get screen time it's dark, and suspenseful. Tom Hulce and Tony Jay support excellent voice work as their characters.The voice work is deep, provoking, original, and emotionally depth. Overall this is a very disappointing Disney Animated Film.

    When I see a Disney animated I look for 3 things, just 3 simple things, the original songs, the humor, and the theme. I think that this movie failed miserably at all of these. First, the songs. They're not original, as most of them tried to be something that has happen in other Disney's classics already. For example in Quasimodo's love song, I can hear the chemistry - the beat sort of - from Be Our Guest running. The songs aren't original. Second, the humor. The only gags are slapstick and not even the good kind. Their humor is cheap, just lots of guys getting hit in the balls. The best of all the humor is probably the 3 stone stooges, which is no where near its past, like Lumiere and co. Last, the theme. Disney movies are supposed to have a simple and just purely good theme. Let's say Beauty and the Beast's redemption from evil, or Pocahontas's love can overcome anything, this movie is no where match. The theme is what, religion and hellfire. I call that bullsh-t. In summary, this is no where near anything Disney has ever done and is terrible at being a Disney family everyone loved.

    When this movie came out, I eventually saw it with some of my friends, and though my mother watched it as well, she never added it to our Disney movie library. I always wondered why not, because I loved the music. Now that I am a parent myself and recently watched this again, I understand. There are several pros and cons to this movie, so I will try to outline what I think of it. Pros: Amazing animation and wonderful songs. Also, most of the voice casting is excellent (including the late Mary Wicks as one of the gargoyles). The songs are both memorable and well-written, and the animation is breathtaking! Cons: Now, for an adult, this film has nothing scandalous or inappropriate, however, for a child, I don't agree. The very sexual nature of Esmeralda, from her dancing to her being lusted after by the judge, is definitely not kid-friendly. I mean, why is there all of this sexual tension in a kids movie? Also, the movie is nearly nothing like the book (which is a classic!). However, the book is rather dark, so I can understand lightening it up for kids. But, overall, this movie is rather dark, scary, and a bit too sexual for my tastes (at least for younger children). Overall, this movie has many pros and several cons. My daughter is 4, so she doesn't notice the cons as much (though she definitely prefers the lighter Disney movies like Mary Poppins and Cinderella), but I don't think I am comfortable letting her watch this movie a whole lot. To me, it is not the kind of Disney movie that I am a big fan of, though there are parts about it that I love! All in all, it's up to each parent to decide about this movie, but I would advise to let your kids be a bit older before letting them watch this one!

    As you can probably tell from the summary that this movie isn't that fit for kids. Yet, I still find it to be one of the most underrated films of all time. Why? Well for starters Disney took A LOT of risk with this movie. Instead of making it bright, colorful, and family friendly, "Hunchback" is dark, a little disturbing, and surprisingly has a lot of mature themes. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story. It's about a disfigured man named Quasimodo who lives on top of the bell towers of Notre Damme for all his life because according to his master, Claude Frollo, his "kind" is not welcomed in the streets of Paris and therefore he must spend the rest of his life isolated at the bells of Notre Damme. that's all I'm gonna reveal because I really don't want to spoil the film for you because despite being different from all the other Disney films, I think that "Hunchback of Notre Damme" is magnificent. I like to think of it as the "Dark Knight" of Disney films. Remember when "The Dark Knight" came out? Audiences were so shocked yet so blown away at how dark, gripping, emotional, and complex it was compared to other superhero movies. And it's no surprise that it's often credited as one of the greatest movies ever made today. But why do a lot of people hate Hunchback so much? It did the same thing "the Dark Knight" did, hell it even came out before the "Dark Knight". Why is it forgotten? Well, maybe it's because it's a Disney Movie. Maybe people were tired of the way superheroes were and were happy with the changes that "Dark Knight" gave. When people watch a Disney movie, they expect a colorful movie that's fit for the family. Not a dark film about a disfigured man that is shunned from society. You expect that from Tim Burton, not Disney. Yet again, being different isn't always bad. Just like this movie. I'll admit, I didn't like Hunchback that much as a kid either, and it wasn't until a more recent viewing that I come to respect it. On top of that, this movie arguably offered one of the greatest Disney villains of all time. (watch the movie to find out who it is). He's complex, menacing, and just pure evil. The things he does in the movie is unlike anything any other Disney villain has done before. What about the songs? For the most part, the songs were pretty good, great actually. Particularly the opening and the villain song "Hellfire". So overall, I say go check it out. It's definitely not for everybody, but if you're looking for something different or if you like a movie with a little dark twist, then you should definitely go see it. Just make sure you don't show your kids.

    Disney does have a history of producing some dark films in the past. The Black Cauldron (1985) was the first Disney animated feature to be given a PG rating by the MPAA for a reason. Disney has also had a history of showing young audiences some scary stuff in the past. Remember the evil queen's beggar disguise in Snow White or the "Night on Bald Mountain" sequence in Fantasia or even the pink elephants scene from Dumbo? Those scenes were memorably creepy. Disney has basically made some dark stuff in the past before. But arguably, the darkest and most adult film the Disney Company has produced so far would have to be their 34th full- length animated feature, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Think of this movie as a darker and more complex version of Cinderella (1950). It tells the story of a deformed person named Quasimodo (Tom Hulce) who is forced to stay in the bell tower of Notre Dame by his evil guardian, Frollo (Tony Jay). His only friends are three gargoyles who come to life when no one else is around. One day, Quasimodo goes out of the bell tower to go to the Festival of Fools, a celebration of all kinds of misfits, against Frollo's wishes. When Frollo's guards publicly humiliate Quasimodo in the middle of the festival, a gypsy named Esmeralda (Demi Moore) comes to his defense just as Frollo orders for her to be arrested. But luckily, Esmeralda escapes using her magic tricks that are considered illegal. Now, Frollo is on the hunt for Esmeralda determined to "put her to justice" (I put quotations around that since she really didn't do anything wrong per se). Little does Frollo know that Esmeralda has befriended Quasimodo and (as Frollo would put it) "cast him under a spell" of sorts meaning she teaches Quasimodo that it's okay to be different and that gypsies aren't bad people like Frollo claims that they are. Frollo's Captain of the Guard, Phoebus also befriends these two secretly through other various circumstances since he does not approve of the actions committed by Frollo. Will these three be able to put an end to Frollo's madness or fail? I believe that the most fascinating character in The Hunchback of Notre Dame has got to be the main antagonist, Frollo. Without question, I would easily consider Frollo one of the most complex, adult characters ever concocted by Disney. I personally find it brilliant that he always tries to justify any crimes he commits by claiming that it's all part of God's plan. I also find it clever that he thinks Esmeralda has put a spell on him since he has two intriguing and assuredly sinister plans lined up for when he captures her. He will either burn her at the stake so he can be "cured" of this spell he claims he's under or force her to become romantically involved with him to cure his underlying lust for her. You wouldn't think that this is a Disney flick I'm talking about just based on how I'm describing him, but to be honest, that's why I think he's such a special villain. The drawing and animation in The Hunchback of Notre Dame is simply sensational. The environments that are brought to life in this film really do feel epic because of the scope and detail of the animation. Much like Beauty and the Beast (1991) before it, one needs to simply look at the film first hand in able to truly appreciate the skilled craft and expertise that was put into the film's animation. The music is also spectacular, praise in particular goes to the strong work of the choir for again making everything happening on screen feel so epic in scope. The best songs in this film have got to be "Hellfire" and "The Bells of Notre Dame" because they really do have that elegant and epic quality to them. In addition to that, these songs keep the story moving along as the best musical numbers should. The only personal criticism I could make for this film is that I would have liked to see this film go even darker. The reason for that is because the storytellers here did such a good job at taking a story with adult subject matter and churning it into something palatable for kids. They did so well in fact that I would have edited out the parts with the gargoyles and the slapstick moments since they're basically more dramatically distracting than helpful to the plot. I think had the gargoyles and slapstick stuff that was meant to appeal to the kids been taken out, The Hunchback of Notre Dame would easily rank as one of the finest pictures ever put out by Disney. As it is though, the criticisms wouldn't matter too much since I already think that this is Disney's most underrated animated feature since Alice in Wonderland (1951). In addition to being a visual marvel to feast my eyes on and a pleasure to listen to with such killer songs such as the ones I've stated before, The Hunchback of Notre Dame does an exceptional job at teaching kids the importance of tolerating people of a different culture, religion, race, and visual appearance. This is a remarkable achievement, one of the studio's finest.

    Let me say that this is one of my FAVORITE MOVIES EVER! <3 And I think it is a SUPER underrated Disney film.I've heard some people say that the songs are weak compared to the songs in more acclaimed Disney films like Aladdin or The Little Mermaid.I TOTALLY disagree.I think the opening song is VERY powerful and God Help the Outcasts was simply beautiful and worked wonderful with Esmeralda's voice.Heaven's Light was a really beautiful and bittersweet song(bittersweet because we know what happens later)And the Hell Fire sequence was freaking EPIC.And am I the only one that found the gargoyle's song catchy and not annoying?Anyway,I also thought the score was AMAZING.I mean just listen to how powerful it sounds.It's all FSDUHAGAJBAMGK(that means amazingly powerful.)From the beginning by just hearing the music you can already tell the movie is going to be epic! Let's move on with the characters!I love the characters in this movie!Quasimodo is plain out lovable.I don't see how you can dislike such a sweet character.He is also a strong character who truly cares about Esmeralda,even when she does break his heart he still helps her because he truly cared about her.Phoebes is funny and I love his attitude and the way he stood for what was right even though there were consequences for him.And Esmeralda is an awesome heroine!I also love how she stands up for what is right and rebels.She's so kind and sly too.I didn't think the Gargoyles were annoying,I actually kinda liked them.I can't decide if the movie would be better without their comic relief or not though.However,the comic relief didn't ruin the tone of the film so that's good.As for the villain,Frollo was awesome!I loved his personality and sinisterness(is that a word?)And he is different than all the other Disney villains.He wasn't just out for power and he wasn't evil simply because he liked being evil.He actually thought everything he did was for God so that's really unique in terms of Disney villainy....And Frollo was just plain out awesome. The animation in this movie is beautiful.(well this is Disney,it's not like it would have crappy animation)I really wish Disney would make more beautiful hand drawn animated movies.The computer animation for the backgrounds and what not blended in well without looking cheezy.I love the vibrant colors and wonderful detailed backgrounds,especially in the cathedral. I thought this was a wonderful adaption to a rather grim story.A lot of changes were made to make the film more suitable for children but I give Disney credit for not totally screwing up the story and still keeping some of the more mature elements instead of making it all kiddy kiddy.Yes,it's a Disney film and it's still meant for children so they took out the more brutal things and gave it a ''the good guys live happily ever after'' ending but I'm glad they at least didn't keep the ending TOTALLY perfectly happy(poor Quasi not getting Esmeralda)I recommend this film to all children,animation buffs,or anyone who likes a good family movie ^.^ 10 out of 10 stars!Thanks for reading,my kitties!ღ

    I'm sorry, but I am a Disney fanatic, freak, whatever you want to call it and I cannot stand this movie. This is the one time Disney has failed in my eyes. I don't see why anyone would like this movie. And it's not because the main character is fugly and gross, it's because of the end. I thought it sent a terrible message to kids. The guy totally falls in love with Esmeralda, goes out of his way (I mean above and beyond the call of duty) to rescue her and be the good guy to prove his love for her...and she ends up with the handsome one?! What kind of message is that? To me that is Disney saying "the hot girl belongs with the hot guy and the fugly hero can never have true love". I don't know if this movie is based off a book or a true story, so if that is the case then I could kind of forgive it...but if not, Disney made a huge mistake. There are some good songs, the villain is very easy to hate, and the handsome soldier guy does provide some comedy relief along with the gargoyles, but other than that movie pretty much sucks.

    As you can probably tell from the summary that this movie isn't that fit for kids. Yet, I still find it to be one of the most underrated films of all time. Why? Well for starters Disney took A LOT of risk with this movie. Instead of making it bright, colorful, and family friendly, "Hunchback" is dark, a little disturbing, and surprisingly has a lot of mature themes. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story. It's about a disfigured man named Quasimodo who lives on top of the bell towers of Notre Damme for all his life because according to his master, Claude Frollo, his "kind" is not welcomed in the streets of Paris and therefore he must spend the rest of his life isolated at the bells of Notre Damme. that's all I'm gonna reveal because I really don't want to spoil the film for you because despite being different from all the other Disney films, I think that "Hunchback of Notre Damme" is magnificent. I like to think of it as the "Dark Knight" of Disney films. Remember when "The Dark Knight" came out? Audiences were so shocked yet so blown away at how dark, gripping, emotional, and complex it was compared to other superhero movies. And it's no surprise that it's often credited as one of the greatest movies ever made today. But why do a lot of people hate Hunchback so much? It did the same thing "the Dark Knight" did, hell it even came out before the "Dark Knight". Why is it forgotten? Well, maybe it's because it's a Disney Movie. Maybe people were tired of the way superheroes were and were happy with the changes that "Dark Knight" gave. When people watch a Disney movie, they expect a colorful movie that's fit for the family. Not a dark film about a disfigured man that is shunned from society. You expect that from Tim Burton, not Disney. Yet again, being different isn't always bad. Just like this movie. I'll admit, I didn't like Hunchback that much as a kid either, and it wasn't until a more recent viewing that I come to respect it. On top of that, this movie arguably offered one of the greatest Disney villains of all time. (watch the movie to find out who it is). He's complex, menacing, and just pure evil. The things he does in the movie is unlike anything any other Disney villain has done before. What about the songs? For the most part, the songs were pretty good, great actually. Particularly the opening and the villain song "Hellfire". So overall, I say go check it out. It's definitely not for everybody, but if you're looking for something different or if you like a movie with a little dark twist, then you should definitely go see it. Just make sure you don't show your kids.

    Disney does have a history of producing some dark films in the past. The Black Cauldron (1985) was the first Disney animated feature to be given a PG rating by the MPAA for a reason. Disney has also had a history of showing young audiences some scary stuff in the past. Remember the evil queen's beggar disguise in Snow White or the "Night on Bald Mountain" sequence in Fantasia or even the pink elephants scene from Dumbo? Those scenes were memorably creepy. Disney has basically made some dark stuff in the past before. But arguably, the darkest and most adult film the Disney Company has produced so far would have to be their 34th full- length animated feature, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Think of this movie as a darker and more complex version of Cinderella (1950). It tells the story of a deformed person named Quasimodo (Tom Hulce) who is forced to stay in the bell tower of Notre Dame by his evil guardian, Frollo (Tony Jay). His only friends are three gargoyles who come to life when no one else is around. One day, Quasimodo goes out of the bell tower to go to the Festival of Fools, a celebration of all kinds of misfits, against Frollo's wishes. When Frollo's guards publicly humiliate Quasimodo in the middle of the festival, a gypsy named Esmeralda (Demi Moore) comes to his defense just as Frollo orders for her to be arrested. But luckily, Esmeralda escapes using her magic tricks that are considered illegal. Now, Frollo is on the hunt for Esmeralda determined to "put her to justice" (I put quotations around that since she really didn't do anything wrong per se). Little does Frollo know that Esmeralda has befriended Quasimodo and (as Frollo would put it) "cast him under a spell" of sorts meaning she teaches Quasimodo that it's okay to be different and that gypsies aren't bad people like Frollo claims that they are. Frollo's Captain of the Guard, Phoebus also befriends these two secretly through other various circumstances since he does not approve of the actions committed by Frollo. Will these three be able to put an end to Frollo's madness or fail? I believe that the most fascinating character in The Hunchback of Notre Dame has got to be the main antagonist, Frollo. Without question, I would easily consider Frollo one of the most complex, adult characters ever concocted by Disney. I personally find it brilliant that he always tries to justify any crimes he commits by claiming that it's all part of God's plan. I also find it clever that he thinks Esmeralda has put a spell on him since he has two intriguing and assuredly sinister plans lined up for when he captures her. He will either burn her at the stake so he can be "cured" of this spell he claims he's under or force her to become romantically involved with him to cure his underlying lust for her. You wouldn't think that this is a Disney flick I'm talking about just based on how I'm describing him, but to be honest, that's why I think he's such a special villain. The drawing and animation in The Hunchback of Notre Dame is simply sensational. The environments that are brought to life in this film really do feel epic because of the scope and detail of the animation. Much like Beauty and the Beast (1991) before it, one needs to simply look at the film first hand in able to truly appreciate the skilled craft and expertise that was put into the film's animation. The music is also spectacular, praise in particular goes to the strong work of the choir for again making everything happening on screen feel so epic in scope. The best songs in this film have got to be "Hellfire" and "The Bells of Notre Dame" because they really do have that elegant and epic quality to them. In addition to that, these songs keep the story moving along as the best musical numbers should. The only personal criticism I could make for this film is that I would have liked to see this film go even darker. The reason for that is because the storytellers here did such a good job at taking a story with adult subject matter and churning it into something palatable for kids. They did so well in fact that I would have edited out the parts with the gargoyles and the slapstick moments since they're basically more dramatically distracting than helpful to the plot. I think had the gargoyles and slapstick stuff that was meant to appeal to the kids been taken out, The Hunchback of Notre Dame would easily rank as one of the finest pictures ever put out by Disney. As it is though, the criticisms wouldn't matter too much since I already think that this is Disney's most underrated animated feature since Alice in Wonderland (1951). In addition to being a visual marvel to feast my eyes on and a pleasure to listen to with such killer songs such as the ones I've stated before, The Hunchback of Notre Dame does an exceptional job at teaching kids the importance of tolerating people of a different culture, religion, race, and visual appearance. This is a remarkable achievement, one of the studio's finest.

    Let me say that this is one of my FAVORITE MOVIES EVER! <3 And I think it is a SUPER underrated Disney film.I've heard some people say that the songs are weak compared to the songs in more acclaimed Disney films like Aladdin or The Little Mermaid.I TOTALLY disagree.I think the opening song is VERY powerful and God Help the Outcasts was simply beautiful and worked wonderful with Esmeralda's voice.Heaven's Light was a really beautiful and bittersweet song(bittersweet because we know what happens later)And the Hell Fire sequence was freaking EPIC.And am I the only one that found the gargoyle's song catchy and not annoying?Anyway,I also thought the score was AMAZING.I mean just listen to how powerful it sounds.It's all FSDUHAGAJBAMGK(that means amazingly powerful.)From the beginning by just hearing the music you can already tell the movie is going to be epic! Let's move on with the characters!I love the characters in this movie!Quasimodo is plain out lovable.I don't see how you can dislike such a sweet character.He is also a strong character who truly cares about Esmeralda,even when she does break his heart he still helps her because he truly cared about her.Phoebes is funny and I love his attitude and the way he stood for what was right even though there were consequences for him.And Esmeralda is an awesome heroine!I also love how she stands up for what is right and rebels.She's so kind and sly too.I didn't think the Gargoyles were annoying,I actually kinda liked them.I can't decide if the movie would be better without their comic relief or not though.However,the comic relief didn't ruin the tone of the film so that's good.As for the villain,Frollo was awesome!I loved his personality and sinisterness(is that a word?)And he is different than all the other Disney villains.He wasn't just out for power and he wasn't evil simply because he liked being evil.He actually thought everything he did was for God so that's really unique in terms of Disney villainy....And Frollo was just plain out awesome. The animation in this movie is beautiful.(well this is Disney,it's not like it would have crappy animation)I really wish Disney would make more beautiful hand drawn animated movies.The computer animation for the backgrounds and what not blended in well without looking cheezy.I love the vibrant colors and wonderful detailed backgrounds,especially in the cathedral. I thought this was a wonderful adaption to a rather grim story.A lot of changes were made to make the film more suitable for children but I give Disney credit for not totally screwing up the story and still keeping some of the more mature elements instead of making it all kiddy kiddy.Yes,it's a Disney film and it's still meant for children so they took out the more brutal things and gave it a ''the good guys live happily ever after'' ending but I'm glad they at least didn't keep the ending TOTALLY perfectly happy(poor Quasi not getting Esmeralda)I recommend this film to all children,animation buffs,or anyone who likes a good family movie ^.^ 10 out of 10 stars!Thanks for reading,my kitties!ღ

    I'm sorry, but I am a Disney fanatic, freak, whatever you want to call it and I cannot stand this movie. This is the one time Disney has failed in my eyes. I don't see why anyone would like this movie. And it's not because the main character is fugly and gross, it's because of the end. I thought it sent a terrible message to kids. The guy totally falls in love with Esmeralda, goes out of his way (I mean above and beyond the call of duty) to rescue her and be the good guy to prove his love for her...and she ends up with the handsome one?! What kind of message is that? To me that is Disney saying "the hot girl belongs with the hot guy and the fugly hero can never have true love". I don't know if this movie is based off a book or a true story, so if that is the case then I could kind of forgive it...but if not, Disney made a huge mistake. There are some good songs, the villain is very easy to hate, and the handsome soldier guy does provide some comedy relief along with the gargoyles, but other than that movie pretty much sucks.

    Considered as Disney's one of darkest films of all times, Hunchback of Notre Dame is still one of my most favorite masterpiece Disney has created (the other one being Beauty and the Beast). The songs, unlike what other reviewers said, were fantastic. I mean, compared to the likes of Lion King and Little Mermaid, the songs weren't for the children, but it's so moving and wonderful. Plus the orchestration and the score, Menken totally deserved the Oscar for that. It's so sad that this is considered one of Disney's most underrated film. Anyways, I'm really looking forward to see this on Broadway (there've been rumors), and I know that this will succeed on Broadway because the songs and the story for that matter is really Broadway's, if you know what I mean... All in all, great film nevertheless..

    In 15th century Paris, Quasimodo the hunchback of Notre Dame falls for gypsy girl Esmeralda who was the only one to show him kindness. Claude Frollo the Minister of Justice has kept Quasimodo hidden in the belltower. The cruel Frollo set his soldiers to destroy the world of the gypsy and it's up to Quasimodo and the handsome Phoebus to come to the rescue. This Disney animation looks great. The story is a beautiful poignant story of sacrifice and love. The only thing missing is a really good iconic song. That would have added at least a point. The characters are really compelling.

    The Hunchback of Notre Dame was a film I never saw as a child. For some reason, my parents didn't own it and I remember watching the typical films like The Lion King, The Little Mermaid and many princess type films as I was a typical girly girl. I've gotten into a Disney obsession, wanting to watch all the Disney movies and I one I desperately wanted to see was The Hunchback of Notre Dame, after seeing praising reviews and friends saying it was a very fabulous film. So, is it any good? The Hunchback of Notre Dame sets in 15th century, France and tells the story of the bellringer, Quasimodo who lives in the belltower. After Judge Claude Frollo killed his mother and father when Quasi was a baby, the Archdeacon convinces him to raise as him as his son. 20 years later, another year has passed and it's time for Quasi's favourite past-time, watching the Feast of Fools. Desperately wanting to go, he leaves the bell tower, but to be shamed and humiliated in front of the crowd due to his disfigured look until Esmeralda, a kind gypsy, saves him. Meanwhile, Frollo is trying to get rid of the gypsies, especially Esmeralda and is desperately wanting to get rid of her. I'll stop the main plot here. The movie is absolutely amazing. From the start, I was sitting on the edge of my seat in awe. The animation is smooth and it's at Disney's finest. The colours and themes mix together so well, and it makes the film look beautiful! The songs are perfect. I honestly believe it has the best sound-track out of any Disney film I have ever seen and trust me, I'm a huge fan of Disney. From the choirs, to the echoing instrument, all of the music is absolutely beautiful. I've even downloaded some on my iPod because the songs give me chills every time. The characters are very likable and Frollo has become my favourite Disney villain. He is the most evilest villain I have ever seen! Esmeralda has become my favourite Disney girl. She's so strong, tough and absolutely kind, a great role model for children and adults alike. Quasi is so kind and such a great character, they nailed him perfectly and I defiantly expected for him to be like what he is in the movie before watching it. Is it for kids? The truth is, it is one of Disney's darkest films, I honestly believe it's the darkest. With themes like murder, sex and more, this may not be suitable for children. Possibly 9 and up. If you're an over-protective parent, maybe keep the movie until they're a bit older. Some children may get confused at the plot, but I'm sure they'll enjoy it anyway. If you're watching it with your child, I'm sure you'll love it too. It's an absolute favourite of mine and I know parents will love it!

    This has got to be one of my least favorite Disney Films. It support's a weak script, un- necessary characters, and has a poor over all message. This film didn't take the books material to best use. This could have been stretched out further, and half of the screen time is spent on the lesser characters. Quasimodo should have had more screen time. The voice work and villain are top notch and so is the animation but everything else is a total disaster. The villain gets very little screen time but when he does get screen time it's dark, and suspenseful. Tom Hulce and Tony Jay support excellent voice work as their characters.The voice work is deep, provoking, original, and emotionally depth. Overall this is a very disappointing Disney Animated Film.

    When I see a Disney animated I look for 3 things, just 3 simple things, the original songs, the humor, and the theme. I think that this movie failed miserably at all of these. First, the songs. They're not original, as most of them tried to be something that has happen in other Disney's classics already. For example in Quasimodo's love song, I can hear the chemistry - the beat sort of - from Be Our Guest running. The songs aren't original. Second, the humor. The only gags are slapstick and not even the good kind. Their humor is cheap, just lots of guys getting hit in the balls. The best of all the humor is probably the 3 stone stooges, which is no where near its past, like Lumiere and co. Last, the theme. Disney movies are supposed to have a simple and just purely good theme. Let's say Beauty and the Beast's redemption from evil, or Pocahontas's love can overcome anything, this movie is no where match. The theme is what, religion and hellfire. I call that bullsh-t. In summary, this is no where near anything Disney has ever done and is terrible at being a Disney family everyone loved.

    When this movie came out, I eventually saw it with some of my friends, and though my mother watched it as well, she never added it to our Disney movie library. I always wondered why not, because I loved the music. Now that I am a parent myself and recently watched this again, I understand. There are several pros and cons to this movie, so I will try to outline what I think of it. Pros: Amazing animation and wonderful songs. Also, most of the voice casting is excellent (including the late Mary Wicks as one of the gargoyles). The songs are both memorable and well-written, and the animation is breathtaking! Cons: Now, for an adult, this film has nothing scandalous or inappropriate, however, for a child, I don't agree. The very sexual nature of Esmeralda, from her dancing to her being lusted after by the judge, is definitely not kid-friendly. I mean, why is there all of this sexual tension in a kids movie? Also, the movie is nearly nothing like the book (which is a classic!). However, the book is rather dark, so I can understand lightening it up for kids. But, overall, this movie is rather dark, scary, and a bit too sexual for my tastes (at least for younger children). Overall, this movie has many pros and several cons. My daughter is 4, so she doesn't notice the cons as much (though she definitely prefers the lighter Disney movies like Mary Poppins and Cinderella), but I don't think I am comfortable letting her watch this movie a whole lot. To me, it is not the kind of Disney movie that I am a big fan of, though there are parts about it that I love! All in all, it's up to each parent to decide about this movie, but I would advise to let your kids be a bit older before letting them watch this one!

Let's move on with the characters!I love the characters in this movie!Quasimodo is plain out lovable.I don't see how you can dislike such a sweet character.He is also a strong character who truly cares about Esmeralda,even when she does break his heart he still helps her because he truly cared about her.Phoebes is funny and I love his attitude and the way he stood for what was right even though there were consequences for him.And Esmeralda is an awesome heroine!I also love how she stands up for what is right and rebels.She's so kind and sly too.I didn't think the Gargoyles were annoying,I actually kinda liked them.I can't decide if the movie would be better without their comic relief or not though.However,the comic relief didn't ruin the tone of the film so that's good.As for the villain,Frollo was awesome!I loved his personality and sinisterness(is that a word?)And he is different than all the other Disney villains.He wasn't just out for power and he wasn't evil simply because he liked being evil.He actually thought everything he did was for God so that's really unique in terms of Disney villainy....And Frollo was just plain out awesome. The animation in this movie is beautiful.(well this is Disney,it's not like it would have crappy animation)I really wish Disney would make more beautiful hand drawn animated movies.The computer animation for the backgrounds and what not blended in well without looking cheezy.I love the vibrant colors and wonderful detailed backgrounds,especially in the cathedral. I thought this was a wonderful adaption to a rather grim story.A lot of changes were made to make the film more suitable for children but I give Disney credit for not totally screwing up the story and still keeping some of the more mature elements instead of making it all kiddy kiddy.Yes,it's a Disney film and it's still meant for children so they took out the more brutal things and gave it a ''the good guys live happily ever after'' ending but I'm glad they at least didn't keep the ending TOTALLY perfectly happy(poor Quasi not getting Esmeralda)I recommend this film to all children,animation buffs,or anyone who likes a good family movie ^.^ 10 out of 10 stars!Thanks for reading,my kitties!ღ

    I'm sorry, but I am a Disney fanatic, freak, whatever you want to call it and I cannot stand this movie. This is the one time Disney has failed in my eyes. I don't see why anyone would like this movie. And it's not because the main character is fugly and gross, it's because of the end. I thought it sent a terrible message to kids. The guy totally falls in love with Esmeralda, goes out of his way (I mean above and beyond the call of duty) to rescue her and be the good guy to prove his love for her...and she ends up with the handsome one?! What kind of message is that? To me that is Disney saying "the hot girl belongs with the hot guy and the fugly hero can never have true love". I don't know if this movie is based off a book or a true story, so if that is the case then I could kind of forgive it...but if not, Disney made a huge mistake. There are some good songs, the villain is very easy to hate, and the handsome soldier guy does provide some comedy relief along with the gargoyles, but other than that movie pretty much sucks.

    Considered as Disney's one of darkest films of all times, Hunchback of Notre Dame is still one of my most favorite masterpiece Disney has created (the other one being Beauty and the Beast). The songs, unlike what other reviewers said, were fantastic. I mean, compared to the likes of Lion King and Little Mermaid, the songs weren't for the children, but it's so moving and wonderful. Plus the orchestration and the score, Menken totally deserved the Oscar for that. It's so sad that this is considered one of Disney's most underrated film. Anyways, I'm really looking forward to see this on Broadway (there've been rumors), and I know that this will succeed on Broadway because the songs and the story for that matter is really Broadway's, if you know what I mean... All in all, great film nevertheless..
