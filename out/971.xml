 <storyline>
  Greek Sea, World War II. An Italian ship leaves a handful of soldiers in a little island; their mission is to spot enemy ships and to hold the island in case of attack. The village of the island seems abandoned and there isn't a single enemy in sight, so the soldiers begin to relax a little. Things change when their ship is hit and destroyed by the enemy, and the soldiers find themselves abandoned there. Actually, the island isn't deserted and when the Greeks understand that those Italians are harmless, they came out of their hiding places in the mountains and continue their peaceful lives. Soon the soldiers discover that being left behind in a God-forgotten Greek island isn't such a bad thing, after all...

    This war comedy drama is a breezy, colorful and often funny film set on a small Greek island during world war 2. A ship lands on the "deserted Island" with soldiers defending it from invading Germans. The troops soon find some old men and a group of young women, including a prostitute living on a beautiful oasis in the middle of nowhere. They are well fed and entertained by the inhabitants and learn to love their environment. The cast is excellent and the story moves along with a moving script. The scenery is gorgeous and this is a feel good movie which is on my list of best foreign films.

    This Italian film has a pretty title for a start, referring to the name of a sea. Even though it has military men in it, I didn't realize it takes place during World War II. The story is set in Kastell&oacute;rizo (an island in Greece), surrounded by the magnificent Aegean Sea. Therefore, the scenario is one of its best attributes: Greece and the Aegean Sea are owners of a legendary beauty. I also loved Vanna Barba as Vassilissa. She is gorgeous and so hot. I thought she was Italian. She certainly looks Italian instead of Greek and yet she is Greek. Greeks are usually VERY unattractive, so it's quite an impact to see a Greek woman this beautiful, this hot. There is some nudity in the film, which is great, as those hot scenes allow us to see the lovely Vanna Barba nude. As a movie, this was okay. It sort of seems like a comedy with soldiers, a bit in the style of 'Blackadder'.

    The message at the end of this film states that it is dedicated "to all of those who are running away" - as at least three of the main characters in the film ultimately do. As such, it could not be greater escapism for all of us watching; the only way would be to travel to Greece ourselves! Mediterraneo is one of those films that can only make its audience think, laugh, reflect on deeper questions despite the fact that the actual storyline therein is quite simplistic indeed. A number of Italian soldiers, stranded on a Greek island, miss out on the end of World War II - such is the premise here and, just like that, this could have been quite the run-of-the-mill umpteenth boring war film, if done in a certain more marketable way... But it was done the European way: exploring the thoughts, aspirations, even a hint of the souls of these soldiers, rather than their militaristic exploits. And it was done in a lyrical way, even, I dare say! This movie delves into what every single soldier truly aspires to, even in the midst of war - and that is peace and love of course. And where better than a paradisaical Greek island to find such a thing, hmm? Even if time does not allow for much exploration, the ensemble cast is well-defined and each soldier is given such endearing personality traits through the characters as they were written as much as through the fine performances by each and everyone in the cast. They are funny, witty and oh-so-Italiano, while the ladies they meet on the island are voluptuous and strong, and oh-so-Greek too...! Beyond boundaries and borders, we are all the same and this film underlines that in many ways. There is another phrase that will stay with you after all this, if you are either nationality or belong to any other in the vicinity of the Mediterranean sea; and it is "one race, one face." Or the later, amusing version of it, as the second-in-command makes it up as he is indulging in all the good food that is so plentiful there: "one race, one stomach." The scenery is stunning, the music is haunting - I cannot say enough (or more than has already been said) about the intrinsic qualities of this production. It is a feast for all the sense - and for the soul as well. Above all, the entire exercise reminds us of this, too: life is so short. Enjoy it while you can. Find that place where you can finally stop running away.

    Honestly I don't know how this movie could have been translated into English or other languages, since I'm referring to the original, Italian, version of it. I never expected any American so-called critic to full understand what European, and specifically southern-European movies can be about, since we never based the quality of a movie on the amount of car chases, shooting, explosions, well polished (but fake) dialogues and so on. Our cinema is far less shiny but more down-to-Earth. The director, through the words of the character of Lt. Farina, in the very beginning of the movie starts telling a story, which could have been truly happened that way. Why? Because in Italian movies actors act like normal everyday people is. So it appears pretty credible what happened in the movie, between acts of humanity, friendship, inner struggles. Of Course there are typical elements of Italian culture throughout the plot, as the soccer matches, the highly informal language, the warm friendship, and of course to whom is totally unaware of Italian culture, these can appear as childish and pretty silly. But if you look deeply into that, if you leave all prejudices aside, you will discover a beautiful postcard which paints a wonderful small Greek island, in which Italian and Greek people (re)discover their common cultural origins. With the WW2 as background (but there are no fights at all). All in all, reading about American reviews about this movie, in which the writers looked at this movie with a smile of superiority, it reminded me about the part in which the two British sailors came to rescue the marooned soldiers, point at them with a sort of disgust and justify their feelings with: "Italians".

    An outstanding movie. The film flows like water, masterfully directed.Watching this film was enjoyable and it seems like an escape from reality.In them we can identify our desires and our feelings. Escape from the world of war. Shows how little is enough to be happy. Luzers in the war are actually winners and lucky people. People who would kill other peoples yesterday, show us real face, ordinary people with same wishes like ours. This movie proof that is not necessary to spend millions of $ to make great movie. For me personally it is a pleasure to watch this movie any time, sometime I feel that I would like to find similar place today to escape from our modern, hectic life. All in all, great movie, I wouldn't change anything.

    This film reminds me there are still wonderful films that are true works of art. Beautiful open eyes dream on the worst nightmare of war that becomes the most beautiful reality. Great directing and beautiful colors are just following warmest human atmosphere obtained. It is hard to watch this film and not get into it. Simple life and most delicate feelings are what we love about it. Great acting and story that proves that perfection lies in the simple things. Did we make our lives that complicated that we don't want to try beauty of simplicity offered? Our heroes in this film decided to do so in pretty unconventional situation. Watch Mediterraneo and say how much do we really need to be happy. I say 10 out of 10.

    Italian cinematography always had interesting and beside all great movies. "Mediterraneo" is definitely one of them with strong antiwar message. A movie that Americans cannot make cause they haven't experienced wars like the ones that were led on European ground. Story starts when Italian ship leaves a handful of soldiers in a little Greek island during World War II. Italian soldiers must hold that island by any cost. Island seems to be deserted and when their sheep gets destroyed by enemies, soldiers must find a way to live on that island. Soon they found out that the island is not deserted when Greeks came out of their hiding places in the mountains. All of the inhabitants are women, children and old men, so soldiers began to relax and finally live their lives. Gabriele Salvatores made a movie situated during a war without any war scene, presenting the Greek island as heaven on Earth for those untypical soldiers. All of them have their dreams and desires, but as time pasts by, only one soldier always tries to leave at all cost (he wants to come home to his wife). Antonio Farina falls in love with prostitute Vassilissa (gorgeus Vanna Barba) and they even stopped counting days on that island, so they don't know what is happening in the war or in outside world. This island present oasis, imaginary world where everyone is happy. Like some sort of utopia. So from the first to last scene Salvatores directs this movie with no mistakes, cause he had great scenario, actors and he found beautiful location in Greece. I specially liked Diego Abatantuono in role of Nicola Lorusso, but I must also mention Claudio Bigagli and Giuseppe Cederna. Every single person who worked on this drama with elements of comedy created a movie that we all can watch whenever we want to escape from to real world. But is there a place like this on Earth? Yes, I think there are plenty of places like this, but we have to look for them cause nothing good comes easy.

    I understand all the elements play in favor for this movie: the scenario, the outcasts, beautiful women, and even the priest is a centered person. Everything is just perfect when you're not in war with yourself and nature. They even had guns, but for what!? hahahaha... It is a wonderful poetic movie and I understand why it won the Oscar for best foreign language movie of that year. Remember George Bush senior and Kuwait? Well, part of that too... although this time no one was aware for what, 3 years!? (man oh man!) they were suppose to be fighting the second world war! This is the best metaphor of all! A small feel-good masterpiece that will certainly transport you to paradise, especially if you're in war with the world. Casablanca fans will excuse me, but, if time goes by, then it will flash before your eyes while watching this one.

    This film story is culturally valuable because of the ways in which it contradicts itself. The film's credits say that it is, "Dedicated to all those who are running away." A line of dialog reinforces this idea. Lorusso says, "In times like these, escape is the only way. To live and keep dreaming." And yet at the end of the film, Antonio, Lorusso and the Sergeant are all together again on the Greek island that they had wanted to escape so badly at the story's start. They escaped the war by accident. They escaped the reality of their desertion periodically with drugs, sex and games. But the film asserts that once a person allows a culture, a place, or a people to move them, there is no escaping it. Once a person finds beauty within a situation and makes a home out of it, the good feelings and ideals created in that context are forever within them. When Lorusso returns to the island many years after, he says of Italy, "They didn't let us change anything." His life on the island had given him an ideal for a compassionate existence, where people can grow and change, and when he didn't feel capable of achieving that in war-torn Italy, he "escaped" once again to the island where he had been happy. The beauty of this story shines through because of its immense craftsmanship. The story would not have been so moving had the compassionate existence not been created by unlikely people in an unlikely place. The soldiers, the Sergeant admits early on, are a "platoon of misfits": a Bacchus-like Russian, a frequent deserter who wants to get back to his pregnant wife, a pair of goat-herding brothers from the mountains, a weak and feminine but ever-loyal Antonio, a man in love with Lorusso, and a man in love with his donkey. They are anything but soldierly, and their nationalistic feelings, if they ever had any, quickly wane. "I feel abandoned," one of the men comments. Lorusso says, "They left us here and here we'll stay." Staying on the island, early in the story, doesn't seem a very welcome proposition since "Greece is the Tomb of Italians" is written on the wall of the town. But the audience learns, as the characters do, that the townspeople are not only harmless but welcoming and warm. Beautiful cinematography and music ease the audience into a comfortable life on the Greek island along with the soldiers; their senses are our senses, their feelings our feelings, because the elements of film are so carefully crafted. The Sergeant's statement about the "poets, philosophers, warriors, and goddesses" from which they are all descended sets the tone for the film. Antonio recognizes the poet within himself, Vasilissa the goddess. The Sergeant is clearly a philosopher and Lorusso learns to project his warrior-like tendencies towards compassionate means, such as protecting his friends. The story, by allowing us to feel and witness such growth within such ordinarily quirky and believable characters, suggests that such a compassionate existence is available for everyone. The film is dedicated to the audience, who is allowed to escape within its beauty for a while, and come out knowing a little better what human compassion is capable of.

    This is one of my favorite movies - as an Italian (living in South Africa, far away from Italy) everything rang true. The sense of community, the sincerity and hilarity, and the more relaxed approach to life. I recently watched it again after having last seen then movie in 1991, and it reminded me again very vividly of why I loved it in the first place. For those who have not seen it, do so! In an era when we are overloaded with movies produced in Hollywood that reduces humor to anything relating to the human anatomy and bathroom (or pies) in combination, it is exhilarating to see how Europe interprets humor. While there are still elements of "slapstick" in the movie, it is done in a way that it amusing, and not insulting your intelligence.

When Lorusso returns to the island many years after, he says of Italy, "They didn't let us change anything." His life on the island had given him an ideal for a compassionate existence, where people can grow and change, and when he didn't feel capable of achieving that in war-torn Italy, he "escaped" once again to the island where he had been happy. The beauty of this story shines through because of its immense craftsmanship. The story would not have been so moving had the compassionate existence not been created by unlikely people in an unlikely place. The soldiers, the Sergeant admits early on, are a "platoon of misfits": a Bacchus-like Russian, a frequent deserter who wants to get back to his pregnant wife, a pair of goat-herding brothers from the mountains, a weak and feminine but ever-loyal Antonio, a man in love with Lorusso, and a man in love with his donkey. They are anything but soldierly, and their nationalistic feelings, if they ever had any, quickly wane. "I feel abandoned," one of the men comments. Lorusso says, "They left us here and here we'll stay." Staying on the island, early in the story, doesn't seem a very welcome proposition since "Greece is the Tomb of Italians" is written on the wall of the town. But the audience learns, as the characters do, that the townspeople are not only harmless but welcoming and warm. Beautiful cinematography and music ease the audience into a comfortable life on the Greek island along with the soldiers; their senses are our senses, their feelings our feelings, because the elements of film are so carefully crafted. The Sergeant's statement about the "poets, philosophers, warriors, and goddesses" from which they are all descended sets the tone for the film. Antonio recognizes the poet within himself, Vasilissa the goddess. The Sergeant is clearly a philosopher and Lorusso learns to project his warrior-like tendencies towards compassionate means, such as protecting his friends. The story, by allowing us to feel and witness such growth within such ordinarily quirky and believable characters, suggests that such a compassionate existence is available for everyone. The film is dedicated to the audience, who is allowed to escape within its beauty for a while, and come out knowing a little better what human compassion is capable of.

    This is one of my favorite movies - as an Italian (living in South Africa, far away from Italy) everything rang true. The sense of community, the sincerity and hilarity, and the more relaxed approach to life. I recently watched it again after having last seen then movie in 1991, and it reminded me again very vividly of why I loved it in the first place. For those who have not seen it, do so! In an era when we are overloaded with movies produced in Hollywood that reduces humor to anything relating to the human anatomy and bathroom (or pies) in combination, it is exhilarating to see how Europe interprets humor. While there are still elements of "slapstick" in the movie, it is done in a way that it amusing, and not insulting your intelligence.

    This war comedy drama is a breezy, colorful and often funny film set on a small Greek island during world war 2. A ship lands on the "deserted Island" with soldiers defending it from invading Germans. The troops soon find some old men and a group of young women, including a prostitute living on a beautiful oasis in the middle of nowhere. They are well fed and entertained by the inhabitants and learn to love their environment. The cast is excellent and the story moves along with a moving script. The scenery is gorgeous and this is a feel good movie which is on my list of best foreign films.

    This Italian film has a pretty title for a start, referring to the name of a sea. Even though it has military men in it, I didn't realize it takes place during World War II. The story is set in Kastell&oacute;rizo (an island in Greece), surrounded by the magnificent Aegean Sea. Therefore, the scenario is one of its best attributes: Greece and the Aegean Sea are owners of a legendary beauty. I also loved Vanna Barba as Vassilissa. She is gorgeous and so hot. I thought she was Italian. She certainly looks Italian instead of Greek and yet she is Greek. Greeks are usually VERY unattractive, so it's quite an impact to see a Greek woman this beautiful, this hot. There is some nudity in the film, which is great, as those hot scenes allow us to see the lovely Vanna Barba nude. As a movie, this was okay. It sort of seems like a comedy with soldiers, a bit in the style of 'Blackadder'.

    The message at the end of this film states that it is dedicated "to all of those who are running away" - as at least three of the main characters in the film ultimately do. As such, it could not be greater escapism for all of us watching; the only way would be to travel to Greece ourselves! Mediterraneo is one of those films that can only make its audience think, laugh, reflect on deeper questions despite the fact that the actual storyline therein is quite simplistic indeed. A number of Italian soldiers, stranded on a Greek island, miss out on the end of World War II - such is the premise here and, just like that, this could have been quite the run-of-the-mill umpteenth boring war film, if done in a certain more marketable way... But it was done the European way: exploring the thoughts, aspirations, even a hint of the souls of these soldiers, rather than their militaristic exploits. And it was done in a lyrical way, even, I dare say! This movie delves into what every single soldier truly aspires to, even in the midst of war - and that is peace and love of course. And where better than a paradisaical Greek island to find such a thing, hmm? Even if time does not allow for much exploration, the ensemble cast is well-defined and each soldier is given such endearing personality traits through the characters as they were written as much as through the fine performances by each and everyone in the cast. They are funny, witty and oh-so-Italiano, while the ladies they meet on the island are voluptuous and strong, and oh-so-Greek too...! Beyond boundaries and borders, we are all the same and this film underlines that in many ways. There is another phrase that will stay with you after all this, if you are either nationality or belong to any other in the vicinity of the Mediterranean sea; and it is "one race, one face." Or the later, amusing version of it, as the second-in-command makes it up as he is indulging in all the good food that is so plentiful there: "one race, one stomach." The scenery is stunning, the music is haunting - I cannot say enough (or more than has already been said) about the intrinsic qualities of this production. It is a feast for all the sense - and for the soul as well. Above all, the entire exercise reminds us of this, too: life is so short. Enjoy it while you can. Find that place where you can finally stop running away.

    Honestly I don't know how this movie could have been translated into English or other languages, since I'm referring to the original, Italian, version of it. I never expected any American so-called critic to full understand what European, and specifically southern-European movies can be about, since we never based the quality of a movie on the amount of car chases, shooting, explosions, well polished (but fake) dialogues and so on. Our cinema is far less shiny but more down-to-Earth. The director, through the words of the character of Lt. Farina, in the very beginning of the movie starts telling a story, which could have been truly happened that way. Why? Because in Italian movies actors act like normal everyday people is. So it appears pretty credible what happened in the movie, between acts of humanity, friendship, inner struggles. Of Course there are typical elements of Italian culture throughout the plot, as the soccer matches, the highly informal language, the warm friendship, and of course to whom is totally unaware of Italian culture, these can appear as childish and pretty silly. But if you look deeply into that, if you leave all prejudices aside, you will discover a beautiful postcard which paints a wonderful small Greek island, in which Italian and Greek people (re)discover their common cultural origins. With the WW2 as background (but there are no fights at all). All in all, reading about American reviews about this movie, in which the writers looked at this movie with a smile of superiority, it reminded me about the part in which the two British sailors came to rescue the marooned soldiers, point at them with a sort of disgust and justify their feelings with: "Italians".

    An outstanding movie. The film flows like water, masterfully directed.Watching this film was enjoyable and it seems like an escape from reality.In them we can identify our desires and our feelings. Escape from the world of war. Shows how little is enough to be happy. Luzers in the war are actually winners and lucky people. People who would kill other peoples yesterday, show us real face, ordinary people with same wishes like ours. This movie proof that is not necessary to spend millions of $ to make great movie. For me personally it is a pleasure to watch this movie any time, sometime I feel that I would like to find similar place today to escape from our modern, hectic life. All in all, great movie, I wouldn't change anything.

    This film reminds me there are still wonderful films that are true works of art. Beautiful open eyes dream on the worst nightmare of war that becomes the most beautiful reality. Great directing and beautiful colors are just following warmest human atmosphere obtained. It is hard to watch this film and not get into it. Simple life and most delicate feelings are what we love about it. Great acting and story that proves that perfection lies in the simple things. Did we make our lives that complicated that we don't want to try beauty of simplicity offered? Our heroes in this film decided to do so in pretty unconventional situation. Watch Mediterraneo and say how much do we really need to be happy. I say 10 out of 10.

    Italian cinematography always had interesting and beside all great movies. "Mediterraneo" is definitely one of them with strong antiwar message. A movie that Americans cannot make cause they haven't experienced wars like the ones that were led on European ground. Story starts when Italian ship leaves a handful of soldiers in a little Greek island during World War II. Italian soldiers must hold that island by any cost. Island seems to be deserted and when their sheep gets destroyed by enemies, soldiers must find a way to live on that island. Soon they found out that the island is not deserted when Greeks came out of their hiding places in the mountains. All of the inhabitants are women, children and old men, so soldiers began to relax and finally live their lives. Gabriele Salvatores made a movie situated during a war without any war scene, presenting the Greek island as heaven on Earth for those untypical soldiers. All of them have their dreams and desires, but as time pasts by, only one soldier always tries to leave at all cost (he wants to come home to his wife). Antonio Farina falls in love with prostitute Vassilissa (gorgeus Vanna Barba) and they even stopped counting days on that island, so they don't know what is happening in the war or in outside world. This island present oasis, imaginary world where everyone is happy. Like some sort of utopia. So from the first to last scene Salvatores directs this movie with no mistakes, cause he had great scenario, actors and he found beautiful location in Greece. I specially liked Diego Abatantuono in role of Nicola Lorusso, but I must also mention Claudio Bigagli and Giuseppe Cederna. Every single person who worked on this drama with elements of comedy created a movie that we all can watch whenever we want to escape from to real world. But is there a place like this on Earth? Yes, I think there are plenty of places like this, but we have to look for them cause nothing good comes easy.

    I understand all the elements play in favor for this movie: the scenario, the outcasts, beautiful women, and even the priest is a centered person. Everything is just perfect when you're not in war with yourself and nature. They even had guns, but for what!? hahahaha... It is a wonderful poetic movie and I understand why it won the Oscar for best foreign language movie of that year. Remember George Bush senior and Kuwait? Well, part of that too... although this time no one was aware for what, 3 years!? (man oh man!) they were suppose to be fighting the second world war! This is the best metaphor of all! A small feel-good masterpiece that will certainly transport you to paradise, especially if you're in war with the world. Casablanca fans will excuse me, but, if time goes by, then it will flash before your eyes while watching this one.

    This film story is culturally valuable because of the ways in which it contradicts itself. The film's credits say that it is, "Dedicated to all those who are running away." A line of dialog reinforces this idea. Lorusso says, "In times like these, escape is the only way. To live and keep dreaming." And yet at the end of the film, Antonio, Lorusso and the Sergeant are all together again on the Greek island that they had wanted to escape so badly at the story's start. They escaped the war by accident. They escaped the reality of their desertion periodically with drugs, sex and games. But the film asserts that once a person allows a culture, a place, or a people to move them, there is no escaping it. Once a person finds beauty within a situation and makes a home out of it, the good feelings and ideals created in that context are forever within them. When Lorusso returns to the island many years after, he says of Italy, "They didn't let us change anything." His life on the island had given him an ideal for a compassionate existence, where people can grow and change, and when he didn't feel capable of achieving that in war-torn Italy, he "escaped" once again to the island where he had been happy. The beauty of this story shines through because of its immense craftsmanship. The story would not have been so moving had the compassionate existence not been created by unlikely people in an unlikely place. The soldiers, the Sergeant admits early on, are a "platoon of misfits": a Bacchus-like Russian, a frequent deserter who wants to get back to his pregnant wife, a pair of goat-herding brothers from the mountains, a weak and feminine but ever-loyal Antonio, a man in love with Lorusso, and a man in love with his donkey. They are anything but soldierly, and their nationalistic feelings, if they ever had any, quickly wane. "I feel abandoned," one of the men comments. Lorusso says, "They left us here and here we'll stay." Staying on the island, early in the story, doesn't seem a very welcome proposition since "Greece is the Tomb of Italians" is written on the wall of the town. But the audience learns, as the characters do, that the townspeople are not only harmless but welcoming and warm.

    This film story is culturally valuable because of the ways in which it contradicts itself. The film's credits say that it is, "Dedicated to all those who are running away." A line of dialog reinforces this idea. Lorusso says, "In times like these, escape is the only way. To live and keep dreaming." And yet at the end of the film, Antonio, Lorusso and the Sergeant are all together again on the Greek island that they had wanted to escape so badly at the story's start. They escaped the war by accident. They escaped the reality of their desertion periodically with drugs, sex and games. But the film asserts that once a person allows a culture, a place, or a people to move them, there is no escaping it. Once a person finds beauty within a situation and makes a home out of it, the good feelings and ideals created in that context are forever within them. When Lorusso returns to the island many years after, he says of Italy, "They didn't let us change anything." His life on the island had given him an ideal for a compassionate existence, where people can grow and change, and when he didn't feel capable of achieving that in war-torn Italy, he "escaped" once again to the island where he had been happy. The beauty of this story shines through because of its immense craftsmanship. The story would not have been so moving had the compassionate existence not been created by unlikely people in an unlikely place. The soldiers, the Sergeant admits early on, are a "platoon of misfits": a Bacchus-like Russian, a frequent deserter who wants to get back to his pregnant wife, a pair of goat-herding brothers from the mountains, a weak and feminine but ever-loyal Antonio, a man in love with Lorusso, and a man in love with his donkey. They are anything but soldierly, and their nationalistic feelings, if they ever had any, quickly wane. "I feel abandoned," one of the men comments. Lorusso says, "They left us here and here we'll stay." Staying on the island, early in the story, doesn't seem a very welcome proposition since "Greece is the Tomb of Italians" is written on the wall of the town. But the audience learns, as the characters do, that the townspeople are not only harmless but welcoming and warm. Beautiful cinematography and music ease the audience into a comfortable life on the Greek island along with the soldiers; their senses are our senses, their feelings our feelings, because the elements of film are so carefully crafted. The Sergeant's statement about the "poets, philosophers, warriors, and goddesses" from which they are all descended sets the tone for the film. Antonio recognizes the poet within himself, Vasilissa the goddess. The Sergeant is clearly a philosopher and Lorusso learns to project his warrior-like tendencies towards compassionate means, such as protecting his friends. The story, by allowing us to feel and witness such growth within such ordinarily quirky and believable characters, suggests that such a compassionate existence is available for everyone. The film is dedicated to the audience, who is allowed to escape within its beauty for a while, and come out knowing a little better what human compassion is capable of.

    This is one of my favorite movies - as an Italian (living in South Africa, far away from Italy) everything rang true. The sense of community, the sincerity and hilarity, and the more relaxed approach to life. I recently watched it again after having last seen then movie in 1991, and it reminded me again very vividly of why I loved it in the first place. For those who have not seen it, do so! In an era when we are overloaded with movies produced in Hollywood that reduces humor to anything relating to the human anatomy and bathroom (or pies) in combination, it is exhilarating to see how Europe interprets humor. While there are still elements of "slapstick" in the movie, it is done in a way that it amusing, and not insulting your intelligence.
