 <sinopse>
  Karl Childers, a simple man hospitalized since his childhood murder of his mother and her lover, is released to start a new life in a small town.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A partially handicapped man named Karl is released from a mental hospital, about 20 years after murdering his mother and another person. Karl is often questioned if he will ever kill again, and he shrugs in response saying there is no reason to. Now out of the mental institution, Karl settles in his old, small hometown, occupying himself by fixing motors. After meeting a young boy named Frank, who befriends him, Karl is invited to stay at Frank's house with his mother Linda, who views Karl as a strange but kind and generous man. However, Linda's abusive boyfriend, Doyle, sees things differently in the way rules ought to be run- normally insulting Linda's homosexual friend Vaughan as well as Karl's disabilities, and having wild parties with his friends. As Karl's relationship with Frank grows, he is watchful of Doyle's cruel actions.

    It was just pure luck I discovered this movie. But thanks to that greater power that I did so. I mean, I love Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, but seriously Academy take that thing back and give it to Thornton. Billy Bob Thornton. Genius. Unbelievable. In the first minutes I could not believe that the man playing Karl is Thornton. His voice alone puts you in a situation, that you want absolute silence, when you're watching the movie. His character makes you smile and cry at the same time... I needed 17 years to discover this movie. I do apologize. Mr.Thornton where are you hiding? No, seriously. Please take out everything you ever had in your mind for an movie and start shooting. Right away. I will see all of them.

    There's no question that without "Sling Blade" Billy Bob Thornton would not have the respect he has today as an artist, even though he's not particularly celebrated for his other films as a director, nor is he particularly admired for his musical career as a country singer/songwriter. Although no one can deny he has had a respectable and prolific acting career, "Sling Blade" definitely stands out as the most beautiful and heartfelt of all of his films. Karl is a middle aged, mentally challenged man who gets released from the mental institution he had been in since he was 12, for having killed his mother and her lover. Out in the real world for the first time in a long time, he soon meets a young kid, Frank, who together with his mother offers Karl a place in their home. However, living with them is Doyle, the mother's evil, alcoholic boyfriend, who is hostile and acts as a mean bully towards the entire family. Although at first it seems that Thornton is doing some overacting as the main protagonist, in the end he clearly is the man stealing the show every time, and creates an utterly memorable character the audience can fall in love with immediately. The power of the film lies in how straightforward and universal it is, even though it takes place in a very unique and specific area, the deep South of the United States. Its themes are about being dear to someone and loving them, and as consequence being able to sacrifice oneself for them. Karl's figure here, although a man with not much mystery (his dark past is immediately revealed, so there's not much else to discover) is almost a divine presence; in the scenes of domestic violence, he silently sits on the edge of the frame, passively witnessing the secretive horrors of abuse. The fact that he gets baptizes by his own will might even imply a Jesus-like figure. Then again, this is not a movie with hidden meanings and obscure symbolism: it's a somewhat Gothic, modern tale told with just as much darkness as tenderness.

    This is one BADASS film! I saw it for the first time 5 or 6 weeks ago. I was AMAZED; by the story, Billy Bob Badass's performance (he was acting, wasn't he?), the directing, the score & the performances of the entire cast, AND the fact that I hadn't seen nor heard of this movie until now. A friend (a long way)from South Carolina played this and two other flicks (Lawless & American History X) for me recently. I was blown away. But Sling Blade was, by far, the best! I have seen hundreds of movies and thousands of acting performances. This is some powerful stuff! This is among the very best. And Thornton.....well, Burton, Anthony Hopkins, Denzel, Jack, Pacino, Sir Lawrence, Sidney, Penn, Kilmer and all of the rest ain't got nothing on him. I don't say that lightly, but I say it all the same.

    Rarely does a film reach the level of perfection achieved by the great films ever made. The Godfather. Slumdog Millionaire. The Fugitive. The Shawshank Redemption. Field Of Dreams. Just to name a few. Sling Blade is one such film. In a career-best, mind-boggling effort, Billy Bob Thornton shines as the star, writer, and director of this amazing film. He plays a curious character named Karl Childers, who's just been released from a mental hospital in the deep south. Karl did something very, very bad many, many years ago, but decades of being institutionalized has weathered him some. He's been set up with a part-time job and a place to stay. At first, we're wondering if Karl can handle all of this. But when he excels at his job and befriends a young boy, Thornton begins a process in which he expounds upon the character of Karl Childers so skillfully, so tenderly, when we know it's Thornton at the helm of the whole thing, you have to be in awe. We grow, rather quickly, to like Karl, and that's the idea. He strikes a chord within us, somewhere deep and primal. And make no mistake, this is anything but an exploitation of the mentally disturbed or anyone else. No, it's a stirring, heartfelt, and heartbreaking portrayal of a man who seemed doomed to redeem himself. The film also benefits from spot-on supporting performances by the likes of Lucas Black, the boy whom Karl befriends, Natalie Canerday as the boy's mother, Dwight Yoakam as her heavy drinking, dim-witted boyfriend, and John Ritter as the mother's best friend. These performances are top-notch all the way around. But what makes it a "perfect" movie is the way Thornton allowed himself as writer, director, and star to explore the character. Karl is simple, but multi-layered. Thornton creates a growth within the character that is as sensible as it is spellbinding. It's a two-hour peak into a world few would imagine if they hadn't seen it, with southern lower-middle class people in a dusty town set against a backdrop of often gorgeous, lush bayou-type settings. It creates a feel, emotionally. One scene in particular, where Karl goes home for the first time in decades, only to find his babbling, accusatory father rotting away in his rocking chair (a brilliant cameo performance by Robert Duvall), is performed with such a brilliant display of poignancy that we're left to wonder what the hell happened to Thornton in the years since this film. While I loved him in The Man Who Wasn't There, I hated him in Armageddon, and Bad Santa, and Mr. Woodcock, and just about everything else I've seen him in since. Those movies may have their moments, in the right time or place, but Sling Blade is timeless, and light years ahead of the vast majority of his other films. In fact, we're not even sure what year it takes place, and it doesn't matter. The mother's boyfriend, who doesn't like Karl or the Ritter character because he's gay, becomes increasingly confrontational and controlling. We feel fearful of what might happen. The bittersweet ending pulls no punches and plays no tricks; we practically expect it, but can't help being engrossed by it. Sling Blade is remarkable film everyone above the age of say, 16, should see. It's touching and powerful, and it's movie magic.

    Sling Blade gets very close to deliver what is promises, "unmistakable drama". Billy Bob's dream project, it shows how passionately and thoughtfully he has pursued it and created a very impressive piece of work. Billy Bob has written, directed and acted the protagonist in the movie of which the latter two are clear winners. Acting: Billy Bob is an amazing actor and it is expected of him to deliver good performance but in 'Karl' he has created an inconceivably beautiful character, I don't like to compare but if it helps you scale, he has become 'Karl' as much as Robert De Niro had become 'Leonard Lowe' in 'Awakenings' and Dustin Hoffman had become 'Raymond Babbitt' in 'Rain Man'. He has created a modern classic protagonist in 'Karl' 10/10 Others have done an above average job which is a shame given that Billy Bob was creating a masterpiece, it would have been great to have others deliver their best too. This makes the whole story slightly weaker and less convincing. Direction: This film doesn't prick you with cheap tricks, it brims ever so nicely with slow intensity, scene after scene, unfolding small events, revealing characters. It creates a piece of life which is real. At no point, this movie imitates it's inspiration, not a single scene is meaningless which tells me the editing is also top class. It makes me want to ask Billy to direct more movies. He has the gift of being honest, real and dispassionate, which I believe is the top most quality of a true director. Script: This is where the great attempt fails and why 'Sling Blade' will not be among the very best of all time. The script is clearly confused between it's innocently presumed hidden yet bare attempt to reveal a complex moral view and the belief and resolution of a single man, in the tussle, the movie is defeated and it completes no meaning which is beautiful in it's own way though it would have otherwise been masterly. Please watch this one urgently!

    Concerned with some of the dark pits of the human soul, Sling Blade is an interesting and emotionally captivating movie to watch. It is a demonstration of how ill behaviour can cause violence to surge up in human relationships... At the same time, Sling Blade points out some socially sensitive truths about the rights of the mentally disabled, as well as the immaturity that (still) exists in our society, regarding how society views them. The viewer cannot help but feel attached to Karl, the mentally disabled protagonist of the story, within the first couple of minutes. Indeed, the acting is great, especially considering that the roles played are not typical ones. There are, however, some flaws in the plot... for example, I cannot believe that Doyle just sat there, pathetically reading his newspaper, waiting to get hit in the head by a lawnmower blade... Even for someone who disrespects and looks down his nose to "retards", I believe that he should have felt at least a bit threatened (this also contradicts his anxiety because of Karl's earlier nightly walk with a hammer). In addition, I just cannot accept that the boy, Frank, took orders from Doyle without resenting and only limited himself to throwing some angry looks. It just doesn't make sense... Also, I don't think that mentally ill people who have been treated and then released back into society would just live without any supervision... I can forgive, at least to some extent, the aforementioned mistakes, since the acting was so great and really convincing... Nevertheless, I don't think Sling Blade is going to stay with me for a long time... It was moving, emotionally intense, and thought-provoking, but it lacked impressiveness. All in all, I would encourage you to watch the movie if you enjoy the genre.

    I lot of people seem to be down on Thorton for his role in this, but I cannot at all understand that. The point is - the acting, Karl is a 100% believable character. Sure, some may find his voice or mannerisms annoying, personally I did not at all, I found it to add to his character perfectly. The acting in this movie is quite excellent, most other movies don't come close at all, so many of these characters just 'jump out' at you and are totally believable. The beauty of this is that we all know a 'Linda' or a 'Doyle', and maybe a 'Vaughn' - but Karl? Few of us know someone with such a heart, but dealt such a bad hand in life. It fits perfectly with the plight of humanity; some people are gifted with piles of talent and intelligence, but waste it on violence and cheap thrills. Others have next to none, but make the very best of it that they can. Excellent film, either way - give it a chance if you like an excellent drama.

    "Sling Blade" is one of these genuine masterpieces that immediately take you off-guard. As soon as Karl Childers, the central character played by Billy Bob Thornton, starts talking, we know we're unto something new, original and unique. We meet Karl on the day he leaves a mental hospital; he doesn't talk first, forcing himself to listen to one of the inmate's disgusting anecdotes while he stares at the widow. His turn to speak comes when he describes to a young interviewer how he killed his mother and her lover with a Kaiser blade ("some call it a sling blade"). He was a child then and spent a long period trying to socially readjusting himself, mostly through reading Bible, not that he understands a great deal of it, but enough to reckon that people shouldn't kill each other. He talks in the dark, uninterrupted, striking by his raspy voice, colossal jaw and strange rubbing-hands habit highlighting a social unease. His words are punctuated by a weird sound, a "Mm-hmm" growl. Karl easily reminds of Forrest Gump, another mentally challenged character with specific mimics and mannerisms, but he never feels like an imitation, he IS an original and quite memorable creation. And after ten minutes, positive expectations started to invade my thoughts, a movie opening with such an original character and gripping monologue could only lead to cinematic greatness and nothing in the film ever belied my expectations. Thornton didn't just tell a story, he delivered a performance of hypnotic weirdness, enjoyable on a primary level. I loved watching the film again, just to see Karl ordering French fries in a burger restaurant: "I reckon I likes me some French fried potaters, mm-hmm". Some people would call it a 'guilty pleasure', it is but it never distracts from the core of the film, which starts with the rediscovery of freedom by a man of limited intelligence and ends with a poignant sacrifice. In between, "Sling Blade" takes us in a small word of bleak simplicity, nothing much happens, people mind their own business, work to pay the bills, and even a man like Karl can find his place if he has, for instance, a certain ability to fix lawnmowers and whatnot. There's a very smoothly handled straightforwardness in Thornton's script, allowing each important character to touch us directly as if it was an old acquaintance. Karl befriends a little boy named Frank and their fondness is as mutual as immediate. It's the kind of genuine friendships that don't need long set-ups, Frank simply 'loves the way Karl talks', and which child wouldn't? He asks his mother if Karl can live in the garage, she accepts. It feels realistic precisely because Linda is the kind of woman who sees good in everyone, and proves it through her boyfriend, an abusive loser played by Dwight Yoakam, and as others mentioned, the second best performance in the film, Oscar-worthy in every level. Doyle is the kind of wannabe rock-star who never got his break and vents his angry frustration on Frank by pretending to be a fatherly figure on the authority department. Otherwise, he spends most of his time lounging on the sofa, drinking beer, bullying Frank and challenging Linda's patience... he doesn't fool anyone. And within this world, Karl acts as a quiet observant. His passiveness mirrors the attitude of the fifth important character in the film, Linda's friend Vaughan, a homosexual forced to live in the town for easily guessable reasons. As a potential victim of intolerance, Vaughan is able to read through Karl's deadpan expression the hints of some inconsolable wounds, and no matter how tough they were, they certainly built an inner goodness in his heart. But Vaughan isn't a "guy" guy and can't fight a man like Doyle, but Karl can help him to take care of Linda and Frank, both would be like guardian angels. John Ritter delivers a magnificent performance in all nuance and subtlety as a man with great humanistic intuition. And indeed, the storyline concurs with Vaughan and we get more insights about Karl's tormented childhood. Karl is a man of good heart who learned to find the good in anyone because he could see the evil in some, including himself. The ensemble cast is so perfect that it's a wonder that the film didn't get more recognition. Yet the pillar of "Sling Blade" is Billy Bob Thornton. He doesn't perform acting, he's literally inhabited by the painful soul of Karl Childers, and he's so absorbing that we're always in the same wavelength. In one of the film's most significant moments, there is a violent argument between Doyle, Linda and Frank while Karl, almost comically, sits there and doesn't move. But look closely at his eyes, his mimics, his reactions when each object thrown by Frank hits Doyle or the wall. Karl is obviously disturbed as if he was witnessing the reminiscence of painful memories. And somewhat he looks determined to accomplish an act of existential gravity, something foreshadowed by the powerful moment when he grabs Doyle's arm and warns him to never lay a finger on little Frank. This very moment starts the countdown of Karl's freedom days. Although predictable, the conclusion doesn't diminish the film's emotional impact. Karl's actions are less eloquent than the last exchanges he had with each protagonist (including Doyle). They all say "Karl!" and keep silent while he leaves as if they resigned to a deadly omen. The film ends as it started, as if nothing changed. Karl sits in the same place, with the same expression; but this time, he refuses to listen to the pervert inmate and tells him straight in the eyes. Although he played a one-note character, Karl did change and for best. Once in his life, he did well by preventing a little child to endure the same hellish childhood. And I can't see but satisfaction in his eyes in the final, haunting shot.

    When I first watched "Sling Blade" about five years ago, I knew nothing about it and thought it was part of the Wesley Snipes vampire suckfest. I was completely unprepared for what has become my #1 favourite movie of all-time. Simply put, "Sling Blade" is the story of mentally-retarded Karl who gets released from "the nervous hospital" after 30 years, having committed a double murder as a young boy. He is taken in by an extremely trusting woman Linda and her young son Frank, who Karl befriends. This all takes place in what is surely one of the hillbilliest reddest-neck towns in Arkansas. To describe the story as big-hearted doesn't suffice, this story is ALL heart. In addition to the warm engaging characters of Karl, Linda and Frank, there's Linda's friend Vaughn, a closeted smalltown gay guy, and even the minor characters like doctors and mechanics are drawn as compassionate caring characters. This movie can remind you of all the good things human beings are capable of, even in dark circumstances. It's far from easy-viewing. Linda's abusive boyfriend Doyle is violent, manipulative, and threatens to destroy Linda and Frank. There are moments that are hard to watch (nothing graphic) and yet you can't turn your eyes away.

    Whenever there's a poll for the "Best Movie Ever Made", _Sling Blade_ should be a contender. It's a winner throughout its long runtime of 2.5 hours; it never bores, not even in the "Director's Cut" version in which previously cut 20 or so minutes are restored. It's a vehicle for the director, writer and main star of _Sling Blade_, Billy Bob Thornton -- and clearly he invested his life's most intense creative effort into this movie (expanded from an earlier short movie of 25 minutes), and all the effort paid off hugely. The acting is uniformly superb, starting with the ingenious creation of the leading character of Karl Childers; the distinctive speech, behaviour, and movement patters of this character are something that's likely to make you smile ever so often even after you get perfectly used to seeing them. It's like the boy says to Karl, "I like the way you talk," and Karl replies: "I like the way *you* talk." Indeed, this reverse is true as well; never has dialectal speech been captured on film more charmingly than Thornton's native Arkansas dialect in _Sling Blade_, so true to life it may sometimes be difficult, even for native English speakers, to understand what is being said, but you won't mind. Hardly anyone can pull off the trick of showing a grown man embracing a boy and saying, "I love you," with the boy replying, "I love you too," without this involving sexual connotations; but Thornton accomplishes the feat here; the relationship and friendship is portrayed as purely Platonic, that is non-sexual (as opposed to the original Greek concept). A huge accomplishment of _Sling Blade_ is on how many levels it is engaging: it's an engrossing, serious, and essentially brutal drama, but in many moments, it's also wonderful comedy; the dramatic and the comedic are often intertwined within the same scene. There's a delightful cameo by another genius film-maker, Jim Jarmusch, as the seller of "French fried potatoes", at the beginning of the movie; there's definitely a spiritual connection, if you will, between _Sling Blade_ and Jarmusch's work; _Sling Blade_ might well be a Jarmusch movie for all you know, and anyone who loves Jim Jarmusch movies will feel right at home in _Sling Blade_. (Speaking of cameos, let's also give credit to Robert Duvall for the few minutes he can be seen here!) Another astonishing achievement of _Sling Blade_ is that even though you have a pretty good idea about how the movie is going to end -- you don't really mind; it's suspenseful throughout. Watching the movie is likely to make you feel desperate, maddeningly helpless; or you might even become a misanthrope; because you realize that it is only through pure accident or lucky (?) chance that Karl was able to rescue (by questionable means) the mother & boy from the abusive live-in boyfriend (fabulously played by Dwight Yoakam: larger than life here, and more menacing than the repeat killer!). But how many abused families, wives, mothers, or children, are there around the world right now, and have been for centuries, and will be for many more centuries to come, yet with no Karl to come to *their* rescue? After you realize this, it really makes you despair of the human race. Especially after you realize that the suffering is at least partly self-inflicted: the mother brought the abuser's affections onto herself willingly, feeling unable to cope with her life situation on her own after her husband commits suicide due to lacking finances to support his family. That is another stinging aspect of _Sling Blade_: portraying the ridiculous materialistic divides between people, even those in their early teens; see the scene where the girl disdainfully speaks of the bouquet of flowers lovingly presented to her as coming "from a dollar store" and therefore being of inferior quality. Other cast members are great, too, particularly Lucas Black in the boy's role, and John Ritter as the overly sensitive -- or is it cowardly? -- but movingly humane dollar-store owner. Fantastic score by David Lanois, especially in the disjointed rock guitar riffs just prior to the murder scene; it's as if the music was mirroring the lead character's unclear state of mind, his decision-making process. It's fascinating that although we observe Karl Childers for 2.5 hours, he's not really a clear-cut, easily labelled person; we struggle, in classifying him, similarly to Vaughan when, in a funny episode, he believes Karl must have been thinking hard, philosophically, about something, although he was only thinking about food right then. And so, even though Karl is clearly mentally handicapped, in other ways he's a genius, representing a character surrounded by a world intrinsically foreign to him ("it's too big," he says at the end); the world at large is different from Karl -- and so anyone who feels estranged in their life situation, can sympathize with Karl; their fate is like that of Karl. And doesn't this apply to all geniuses, or in a sense: to all artists? This was incisively captured by Vaughan when he remarked that "being gay in this small town is like being handicapped"; but the same might be said of people whose intelligence much exceeds that of their surroundings: they will feel similarly estranged. Yet the world in _Sling Blade_ isn't depicted as black-and-white; funnily enough, the only colour eschewed is red (because Thornton dislikes it); otherwise, _Sling Blade_ shows the world and human beings as they are, in their complex entirety and self-contradicting facets: both beautiful (gorgeous backdrops of rural Arkansas!) and at the same time hideous; both cruel and stupid, and simultaneously compassionate and kind (see the warden and his family, or the Bill Cox character who cannot reconcile his "Christian conscience" with keeping Karl locked away for the night, handing him the keys on day 2).

    This is one BADASS film! I saw it for the first time 5 or 6 weeks ago. I was AMAZED; by the story, Billy Bob Badass's performance (he was acting, wasn't he?), the directing, the score & the performances of the entire cast, AND the fact that I hadn't seen nor heard of this movie until now. A friend (a long way)from South Carolina played this and two other flicks (Lawless & American History X) for me recently. I was blown away. But Sling Blade was, by far, the best! I have seen hundreds of movies and thousands of acting performances. This is some powerful stuff! This is among the very best. And Thornton.....well, Burton, Anthony Hopkins, Denzel, Jack, Pacino, Sir Lawrence, Sidney, Penn, Kilmer and all of the rest ain't got nothing on him. I don't say that lightly, but I say it all the same.

    Rarely does a film reach the level of perfection achieved by the great films ever made. The Godfather. Slumdog Millionaire. The Fugitive. The Shawshank Redemption. Field Of Dreams. Just to name a few. Sling Blade is one such film. In a career-best, mind-boggling effort, Billy Bob Thornton shines as the star, writer, and director of this amazing film. He plays a curious character named Karl Childers, who's just been released from a mental hospital in the deep south. Karl did something very, very bad many, many years ago, but decades of being institutionalized has weathered him some. He's been set up with a part-time job and a place to stay. At first, we're wondering if Karl can handle all of this. But when he excels at his job and befriends a young boy, Thornton begins a process in which he expounds upon the character of Karl Childers so skillfully, so tenderly, when we know it's Thornton at the helm of the whole thing, you have to be in awe. We grow, rather quickly, to like Karl, and that's the idea. He strikes a chord within us, somewhere deep and primal. And make no mistake, this is anything but an exploitation of the mentally disturbed or anyone else. No, it's a stirring, heartfelt, and heartbreaking portrayal of a man who seemed doomed to redeem himself. The film also benefits from spot-on supporting performances by the likes of Lucas Black, the boy whom Karl befriends, Natalie Canerday as the boy's mother, Dwight Yoakam as her heavy drinking, dim-witted boyfriend, and John Ritter as the mother's best friend. These performances are top-notch all the way around. But what makes it a "perfect" movie is the way Thornton allowed himself as writer, director, and star to explore the character. Karl is simple, but multi-layered. Thornton creates a growth within the character that is as sensible as it is spellbinding. It's a two-hour peak into a world few would imagine if they hadn't seen it, with southern lower-middle class people in a dusty town set against a backdrop of often gorgeous, lush bayou-type settings. It creates a feel, emotionally. One scene in particular, where Karl goes home for the first time in decades, only to find his babbling, accusatory father rotting away in his rocking chair (a brilliant cameo performance by Robert Duvall), is performed with such a brilliant display of poignancy that we're left to wonder what the hell happened to Thornton in the years since this film. While I loved him in The Man Who Wasn't There, I hated him in Armageddon, and Bad Santa, and Mr. Woodcock, and just about everything else I've seen him in since. Those movies may have their moments, in the right time or place, but Sling Blade is timeless, and light years ahead of the vast majority of his other films. In fact, we're not even sure what year it takes place, and it doesn't matter. The mother's boyfriend, who doesn't like Karl or the Ritter character because he's gay, becomes increasingly confrontational and controlling. We feel fearful of what might happen. The bittersweet ending pulls no punches and plays no tricks; we practically expect it, but can't help being engrossed by it. Sling Blade is remarkable film everyone above the age of say, 16, should see. It's touching and powerful, and it's movie magic.

    Sling Blade gets very close to deliver what is promises, "unmistakable drama". Billy Bob's dream project, it shows how passionately and thoughtfully he has pursued it and created a very impressive piece of work. Billy Bob has written, directed and acted the protagonist in the movie of which the latter two are clear winners. Acting: Billy Bob is an amazing actor and it is expected of him to deliver good performance but in 'Karl' he has created an inconceivably beautiful character, I don't like to compare but if it helps you scale, he has become 'Karl' as much as Robert De Niro had become 'Leonard Lowe' in 'Awakenings' and Dustin Hoffman had become 'Raymond Babbitt' in 'Rain Man'. He has created a modern classic protagonist in 'Karl' 10/10 Others have done an above average job which is a shame given that Billy Bob was creating a masterpiece, it would have been great to have others deliver their best too. This makes the whole story slightly weaker and less convincing. Direction: This film doesn't prick you with cheap tricks, it brims ever so nicely with slow intensity, scene after scene, unfolding small events, revealing characters. It creates a piece of life which is real. At no point, this movie imitates it's inspiration, not a single scene is meaningless which tells me the editing is also top class. It makes me want to ask Billy to direct more movies. He has the gift of being honest, real and dispassionate, which I believe is the top most quality of a true director. Script: This is where the great attempt fails and why 'Sling Blade' will not be among the very best of all time. The script is clearly confused between it's innocently presumed hidden yet bare attempt to reveal a complex moral view and the belief and resolution of a single man, in the tussle, the movie is defeated and it completes no meaning which is beautiful in it's own way though it would have otherwise been masterly. Please watch this one urgently!

    Concerned with some of the dark pits of the human soul, Sling Blade is an interesting and emotionally captivating movie to watch. It is a demonstration of how ill behaviour can cause violence to surge up in human relationships... At the same time, Sling Blade points out some socially sensitive truths about the rights of the mentally disabled, as well as the immaturity that (still) exists in our society, regarding how society views them. The viewer cannot help but feel attached to Karl, the mentally disabled protagonist of the story, within the first couple of minutes. Indeed, the acting is great, especially considering that the roles played are not typical ones. There are, however, some flaws in the plot... for example, I cannot believe that Doyle just sat there, pathetically reading his newspaper, waiting to get hit in the head by a lawnmower blade... Even for someone who disrespects and looks down his nose to "retards", I believe that he should have felt at least a bit threatened (this also contradicts his anxiety because of Karl's earlier nightly walk with a hammer). In addition, I just cannot accept that the boy, Frank, took orders from Doyle without resenting and only limited himself to throwing some angry looks. It just doesn't make sense... Also, I don't think that mentally ill people who have been treated and then released back into society would just live without any supervision... I can forgive, at least to some extent, the aforementioned mistakes, since the acting was so great and really convincing... Nevertheless, I don't think Sling Blade is going to stay with me for a long time... It was moving, emotionally intense, and thought-provoking, but it lacked impressiveness. All in all, I would encourage you to watch the movie if you enjoy the genre.

    I lot of people seem to be down on Thorton for his role in this, but I cannot at all understand that. The point is - the acting, Karl is a 100% believable character. Sure, some may find his voice or mannerisms annoying, personally I did not at all, I found it to add to his character perfectly. The acting in this movie is quite excellent, most other movies don't come close at all, so many of these characters just 'jump out' at you and are totally believable. The beauty of this is that we all know a 'Linda' or a 'Doyle', and maybe a 'Vaughn' - but Karl? Few of us know someone with such a heart, but dealt such a bad hand in life. It fits perfectly with the plight of humanity; some people are gifted with piles of talent and intelligence, but waste it on violence and cheap thrills. Others have next to none, but make the very best of it that they can. Excellent film, either way - give it a chance if you like an excellent drama.

    "Sling Blade" is one of these genuine masterpieces that immediately take you off-guard. As soon as Karl Childers, the central character played by Billy Bob Thornton, starts talking, we know we're unto something new, original and unique. We meet Karl on the day he leaves a mental hospital; he doesn't talk first, forcing himself to listen to one of the inmate's disgusting anecdotes while he stares at the widow. His turn to speak comes when he describes to a young interviewer how he killed his mother and her lover with a Kaiser blade ("some call it a sling blade"). He was a child then and spent a long period trying to socially readjusting himself, mostly through reading Bible, not that he understands a great deal of it, but enough to reckon that people shouldn't kill each other. He talks in the dark, uninterrupted, striking by his raspy voice, colossal jaw and strange rubbing-hands habit highlighting a social unease. His words are punctuated by a weird sound, a "Mm-hmm" growl. Karl easily reminds of Forrest Gump, another mentally challenged character with specific mimics and mannerisms, but he never feels like an imitation, he IS an original and quite memorable creation. And after ten minutes, positive expectations started to invade my thoughts, a movie opening with such an original character and gripping monologue could only lead to cinematic greatness and nothing in the film ever belied my expectations. Thornton didn't just tell a story, he delivered a performance of hypnotic weirdness, enjoyable on a primary level. I loved watching the film again, just to see Karl ordering French fries in a burger restaurant: "I reckon I likes me some French fried potaters, mm-hmm". Some people would call it a 'guilty pleasure', it is but it never distracts from the core of the film, which starts with the rediscovery of freedom by a man of limited intelligence and ends with a poignant sacrifice. In between, "Sling Blade" takes us in a small word of bleak simplicity, nothing much happens, people mind their own business, work to pay the bills, and even a man like Karl can find his place if he has, for instance, a certain ability to fix lawnmowers and whatnot. There's a very smoothly handled straightforwardness in Thornton's script, allowing each important character to touch us directly as if it was an old acquaintance. Karl befriends a little boy named Frank and their fondness is as mutual as immediate. It's the kind of genuine friendships that don't need long set-ups, Frank simply 'loves the way Karl talks', and which child wouldn't? He asks his mother if Karl can live in the garage, she accepts. It feels realistic precisely because Linda is the kind of woman who sees good in everyone, and proves it through her boyfriend, an abusive loser played by Dwight Yoakam, and as others mentioned, the second best performance in the film, Oscar-worthy in every level. Doyle is the kind of wannabe rock-star who never got his break and vents his angry frustration on Frank by pretending to be a fatherly figure on the authority department. Otherwise, he spends most of his time lounging on the sofa, drinking beer, bullying Frank and challenging Linda's patience... he doesn't fool anyone. And within this world, Karl acts as a quiet observant. His passiveness mirrors the attitude of the fifth important character in the film, Linda's friend Vaughan, a homosexual forced to live in the town for easily guessable reasons. As a potential victim of intolerance, Vaughan is able to read through Karl's deadpan expression the hints of some inconsolable wounds, and no matter how tough they were, they certainly built an inner goodness in his heart. But Vaughan isn't a "guy" guy and can't fight a man like Doyle, but Karl can help him to take care of Linda and Frank, both would be like guardian angels. John Ritter delivers a magnificent performance in all nuance and subtlety as a man with great humanistic intuition. And indeed, the storyline concurs with Vaughan and we get more insights about Karl's tormented childhood. Karl is a man of good heart who learned to find the good in anyone because he could see the evil in some, including himself. The ensemble cast is so perfect that it's a wonder that the film didn't get more recognition. Yet the pillar of "Sling Blade" is Billy Bob Thornton. He doesn't perform acting, he's literally inhabited by the painful soul of Karl Childers, and he's so absorbing that we're always in the same wavelength. In one of the film's most significant moments, there is a violent argument between Doyle, Linda and Frank while Karl, almost comically, sits there and doesn't move. But look closely at his eyes, his mimics, his reactions when each object thrown by Frank hits Doyle or the wall. Karl is obviously disturbed as if he was witnessing the reminiscence of painful memories. And somewhat he looks determined to accomplish an act of existential gravity, something foreshadowed by the powerful moment when he grabs Doyle's arm and warns him to never lay a finger on little Frank. This very moment starts the countdown of Karl's freedom days. Although predictable, the conclusion doesn't diminish the film's emotional impact. Karl's actions are less eloquent than the last exchanges he had with each protagonist (including Doyle). They all say "Karl!" and keep silent while he leaves as if they resigned to a deadly omen. The film ends as it started, as if nothing changed. Karl sits in the same place, with the same expression; but this time, he refuses to listen to the pervert inmate and tells him straight in the eyes. Although he played a one-note character, Karl did change and for best. Once in his life, he did well by preventing a little child to endure the same hellish childhood. And I can't see but satisfaction in his eyes in the final, haunting shot.

    When I first watched "Sling Blade" about five years ago, I knew nothing about it and thought it was part of the Wesley Snipes vampire suckfest. I was completely unprepared for what has become my #1 favourite movie of all-time. Simply put, "Sling Blade" is the story of mentally-retarded Karl who gets released from "the nervous hospital" after 30 years, having committed a double murder as a young boy. He is taken in by an extremely trusting woman Linda and her young son Frank, who Karl befriends. This all takes place in what is surely one of the hillbilliest reddest-neck towns in Arkansas. To describe the story as big-hearted doesn't suffice, this story is ALL heart. In addition to the warm engaging characters of Karl, Linda and Frank, there's Linda's friend Vaughn, a closeted smalltown gay guy, and even the minor characters like doctors and mechanics are drawn as compassionate caring characters. This movie can remind you of all the good things human beings are capable of, even in dark circumstances. It's far from easy-viewing. Linda's abusive boyfriend Doyle is violent, manipulative, and threatens to destroy Linda and Frank. There are moments that are hard to watch (nothing graphic) and yet you can't turn your eyes away.

    Whenever there's a poll for the "Best Movie Ever Made", _Sling Blade_ should be a contender. It's a winner throughout its long runtime of 2.5 hours; it never bores, not even in the "Director's Cut" version in which previously cut 20 or so minutes are restored. It's a vehicle for the director, writer and main star of _Sling Blade_, Billy Bob Thornton -- and clearly he invested his life's most intense creative effort into this movie (expanded from an earlier short movie of 25 minutes), and all the effort paid off hugely. The acting is uniformly superb, starting with the ingenious creation of the leading character of Karl Childers; the distinctive speech, behaviour, and movement patters of this character are something that's likely to make you smile ever so often even after you get perfectly used to seeing them. It's like the boy says to Karl, "I like the way you talk," and Karl replies: "I like the way *you* talk." Indeed, this reverse is true as well; never has dialectal speech been captured on film more charmingly than Thornton's native Arkansas dialect in _Sling Blade_, so true to life it may sometimes be difficult, even for native English speakers, to understand what is being said, but you won't mind. Hardly anyone can pull off the trick of showing a grown man embracing a boy and saying, "I love you," with the boy replying, "I love you too," without this involving sexual connotations; but Thornton accomplishes the feat here; the relationship and friendship is portrayed as purely Platonic, that is non-sexual (as opposed to the original Greek concept). A huge accomplishment of _Sling Blade_ is on how many levels it is engaging: it's an engrossing, serious, and essentially brutal drama, but in many moments, it's also wonderful comedy; the dramatic and the comedic are often intertwined within the same scene. There's a delightful cameo by another genius film-maker, Jim Jarmusch, as the seller of "French fried potatoes", at the beginning of the movie; there's definitely a spiritual connection, if you will, between _Sling Blade_ and Jarmusch's work; _Sling Blade_ might well be a Jarmusch movie for all you know, and anyone who loves Jim Jarmusch movies will feel right at home in _Sling Blade_. (Speaking of cameos, let's also give credit to Robert Duvall for the few minutes he can be seen here!) Another astonishing achievement of _Sling Blade_ is that even though you have a pretty good idea about how the movie is going to end -- you don't really mind; it's suspenseful throughout. Watching the movie is likely to make you feel desperate, maddeningly helpless; or you might even become a misanthrope; because you realize that it is only through pure accident or lucky (?) chance that Karl was able to rescue (by questionable means) the mother & boy from the abusive live-in boyfriend (fabulously played by Dwight Yoakam: larger than life here, and more menacing than the repeat killer!). But how many abused families, wives, mothers, or children, are there around the world right now, and have been for centuries, and will be for many more centuries to come, yet with no Karl to come to *their* rescue? After you realize this, it really makes you despair of the human race. Especially after you realize that the suffering is at least partly self-inflicted: the mother brought the abuser's affections onto herself willingly, feeling unable to cope with her life situation on her own after her husband commits suicide due to lacking finances to support his family. That is another stinging aspect of _Sling Blade_: portraying the ridiculous materialistic divides between people, even those in their early teens; see the scene where the girl disdainfully speaks of the bouquet of flowers lovingly presented to her as coming "from a dollar store" and therefore being of inferior quality. Other cast members are great, too, particularly Lucas Black in the boy's role, and John Ritter as the overly sensitive -- or is it cowardly? -- but movingly humane dollar-store owner. Fantastic score by David Lanois, especially in the disjointed rock guitar riffs just prior to the murder scene; it's as if the music was mirroring the lead character's unclear state of mind, his decision-making process. It's fascinating that although we observe Karl Childers for 2.5 hours, he's not really a clear-cut, easily labelled person; we struggle, in classifying him, similarly to Vaughan when, in a funny episode, he believes Karl must have been thinking hard, philosophically, about something, although he was only thinking about food right then. And so, even though Karl is clearly mentally handicapped, in other ways he's a genius, representing a character surrounded by a world intrinsically foreign to him ("it's too big," he says at the end); the world at large is different from Karl -- and so anyone who feels estranged in their life situation, can sympathize with Karl; their fate is like that of Karl. And doesn't this apply to all geniuses, or in a sense: to all artists? This was incisively captured by Vaughan when he remarked that "being gay in this small town is like being handicapped"; but the same might be said of people whose intelligence much exceeds that of their surroundings: they will feel similarly estranged. Yet the world in _Sling Blade_ isn't depicted as black-and-white; funnily enough, the only colour eschewed is red (because Thornton dislikes it); otherwise, _Sling Blade_ shows the world and human beings as they are, in their complex entirety and self-contradicting facets: both beautiful (gorgeous backdrops of rural Arkansas!) and at the same time hideous; both cruel and stupid, and simultaneously compassionate and kind (see the warden and his family, or the Bill Cox character who cannot reconcile his "Christian conscience" with keeping Karl locked away for the night, handing him the keys on day 2).

    It was just pure luck I discovered this movie. But thanks to that greater power that I did so. I mean, I love Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, but seriously Academy take that thing back and give it to Thornton. Billy Bob Thornton. Genius. Unbelievable. In the first minutes I could not believe that the man playing Karl is Thornton. His voice alone puts you in a situation, that you want absolute silence, when you're watching the movie. His character makes you smile and cry at the same time... I needed 17 years to discover this movie. I do apologize. Mr.Thornton where are you hiding? No, seriously. Please take out everything you ever had in your mind for an movie and start shooting. Right away. I will see all of them.

    There's no question that without "Sling Blade" Billy Bob Thornton would not have the respect he has today as an artist, even though he's not particularly celebrated for his other films as a director, nor is he particularly admired for his musical career as a country singer/songwriter. Although no one can deny he has had a respectable and prolific acting career, "Sling Blade" definitely stands out as the most beautiful and heartfelt of all of his films. Karl is a middle aged, mentally challenged man who gets released from the mental institution he had been in since he was 12, for having killed his mother and her lover. Out in the real world for the first time in a long time, he soon meets a young kid, Frank, who together with his mother offers Karl a place in their home. However, living with them is Doyle, the mother's evil, alcoholic boyfriend, who is hostile and acts as a mean bully towards the entire family. Although at first it seems that Thornton is doing some overacting as the main protagonist, in the end he clearly is the man stealing the show every time, and creates an utterly memorable character the audience can fall in love with immediately. The power of the film lies in how straightforward and universal it is, even though it takes place in a very unique and specific area, the deep South of the United States. Its themes are about being dear to someone and loving them, and as consequence being able to sacrifice oneself for them. Karl's figure here, although a man with not much mystery (his dark past is immediately revealed, so there's not much else to discover) is almost a divine presence; in the scenes of domestic violence, he silently sits on the edge of the frame, passively witnessing the secretive horrors of abuse. The fact that he gets baptizes by his own will might even imply a Jesus-like figure. Then again, this is not a movie with hidden meanings and obscure symbolism: it's a somewhat Gothic, modern tale told with just as much darkness as tenderness.

    Sling Blade gets very close to deliver what is promises, "unmistakable drama". Billy Bob's dream project, it shows how passionately and thoughtfully he has pursued it and created a very impressive piece of work. Billy Bob has written, directed and acted the protagonist in the movie of which the latter two are clear winners. Acting: Billy Bob is an amazing actor and it is expected of him to deliver good performance but in 'Karl' he has created an inconceivably beautiful character, I don't like to compare but if it helps you scale, he has become 'Karl' as much as Robert De Niro had become 'Leonard Lowe' in 'Awakenings' and Dustin Hoffman had become 'Raymond Babbitt' in 'Rain Man'. He has created a modern classic protagonist in 'Karl' 10/10 Others have done an above average job which is a shame given that Billy Bob was creating a masterpiece, it would have been great to have others deliver their best too. This makes the whole story slightly weaker and less convincing. Direction: This film doesn't prick you with cheap tricks, it brims ever so nicely with slow intensity, scene after scene, unfolding small events, revealing characters. It creates a piece of life which is real. At no point, this movie imitates it's inspiration, not a single scene is meaningless which tells me the editing is also top class. It makes me want to ask Billy to direct more movies. He has the gift of being honest, real and dispassionate, which I believe is the top most quality of a true director. Script: This is where the great attempt fails and why 'Sling Blade' will not be among the very best of all time. The script is clearly confused between it's innocently presumed hidden yet bare attempt to reveal a complex moral view and the belief and resolution of a single man, in the tussle, the movie is defeated and it completes no meaning which is beautiful in it's own way though it would have otherwise been masterly. Please watch this one urgently!

    Concerned with some of the dark pits of the human soul, Sling Blade is an interesting and emotionally captivating movie to watch. It is a demonstration of how ill behaviour can cause violence to surge up in human relationships... At the same time, Sling Blade points out some socially sensitive truths about the rights of the mentally disabled, as well as the immaturity that (still) exists in our society, regarding how society views them. The viewer cannot help but feel attached to Karl, the mentally disabled protagonist of the story, within the first couple of minutes. Indeed, the acting is great, especially considering that the roles played are not typical ones. There are, however, some flaws in the plot... for example, I cannot believe that Doyle just sat there, pathetically reading his newspaper, waiting to get hit in the head by a lawnmower blade... Even for someone who disrespects and looks down his nose to "retards", I believe that he should have felt at least a bit threatened (this also contradicts his anxiety because of Karl's earlier nightly walk with a hammer). In addition, I just cannot accept that the boy, Frank, took orders from Doyle without resenting and only limited himself to throwing some angry looks. It just doesn't make sense... Also, I don't think that mentally ill people who have been treated and then released back into society would just live without any supervision... I can forgive, at least to some extent, the aforementioned mistakes, since the acting was so great and really convincing... Nevertheless, I don't think Sling Blade is going to stay with me for a long time... It was moving, emotionally intense, and thought-provoking, but it lacked impressiveness. All in all, I would encourage you to watch the movie if you enjoy the genre.

    I lot of people seem to be down on Thorton for his role in this, but I cannot at all understand that. The point is - the acting, Karl is a 100% believable character. Sure, some may find his voice or mannerisms annoying, personally I did not at all, I found it to add to his character perfectly. The acting in this movie is quite excellent, most other movies don't come close at all, so many of these characters just 'jump out' at you and are totally believable. The beauty of this is that we all know a 'Linda' or a 'Doyle', and maybe a 'Vaughn' - but Karl? Few of us know someone with such a heart, but dealt such a bad hand in life. It fits perfectly with the plight of humanity; some people are gifted with piles of talent and intelligence, but waste it on violence and cheap thrills. Others have next to none, but make the very best of it that they can. Excellent film, either way - give it a chance if you like an excellent drama.

    "Sling Blade" is one of these genuine masterpieces that immediately take you off-guard. As soon as Karl Childers, the central character played by Billy Bob Thornton, starts talking, we know we're unto something new, original and unique. We meet Karl on the day he leaves a mental hospital; he doesn't talk first, forcing himself to listen to one of the inmate's disgusting anecdotes while he stares at the widow. His turn to speak comes when he describes to a young interviewer how he killed his mother and her lover with a Kaiser blade ("some call it a sling blade"). He was a child then and spent a long period trying to socially readjusting himself, mostly through reading Bible, not that he understands a great deal of it, but enough to reckon that people shouldn't kill each other. He talks in the dark, uninterrupted, striking by his raspy voice, colossal jaw and strange rubbing-hands habit highlighting a social unease. His words are punctuated by a weird sound, a "Mm-hmm" growl. Karl easily reminds of Forrest Gump, another mentally challenged character with specific mimics and mannerisms, but he never feels like an imitation, he IS an original and quite memorable creation. And after ten minutes, positive expectations started to invade my thoughts, a movie opening with such an original character and gripping monologue could only lead to cinematic greatness and nothing in the film ever belied my expectations. Thornton didn't just tell a story, he delivered a performance of hypnotic weirdness, enjoyable on a primary level. I loved watching the film again, just to see Karl ordering French fries in a burger restaurant: "I reckon I likes me some French fried potaters, mm-hmm". Some people would call it a 'guilty pleasure', it is but it never distracts from the core of the film, which starts with the rediscovery of freedom by a man of limited intelligence and ends with a poignant sacrifice. In between, "Sling Blade" takes us in a small word of bleak simplicity, nothing much happens, people mind their own business, work to pay the bills, and even a man like Karl can find his place if he has, for instance, a certain ability to fix lawnmowers and whatnot. There's a very smoothly handled straightforwardness in Thornton's script, allowing each important character to touch us directly as if it was an old acquaintance. Karl befriends a little boy named Frank and their fondness is as mutual as immediate. It's the kind of genuine friendships that don't need long set-ups, Frank simply 'loves the way Karl talks', and which child wouldn't? He asks his mother if Karl can live in the garage, she accepts. It feels realistic precisely because Linda is the kind of woman who sees good in everyone, and proves it through her boyfriend, an abusive loser played by Dwight Yoakam, and as others mentioned, the second best performance in the film, Oscar-worthy in every level. Doyle is the kind of wannabe rock-star who never got his break and vents his angry frustration on Frank by pretending to be a fatherly figure on the authority department. Otherwise, he spends most of his time lounging on the sofa, drinking beer, bullying Frank and challenging Linda's patience... he doesn't fool anyone. And within this world, Karl acts as a quiet observant. His passiveness mirrors the attitude of the fifth important character in the film, Linda's friend Vaughan, a homosexual forced to live in the town for easily guessable reasons. As a potential victim of intolerance, Vaughan is able to read through Karl's deadpan expression the hints of some inconsolable wounds, and no matter how tough they were, they certainly built an inner goodness in his heart. But Vaughan isn't a "guy" guy and can't fight a man like Doyle, but Karl can help him to take care of Linda and Frank, both would be like guardian angels. John Ritter delivers a magnificent performance in all nuance and subtlety as a man with great humanistic intuition. And indeed, the storyline concurs with Vaughan and we get more insights about Karl's tormented childhood. Karl is a man of good heart who learned to find the good in anyone because he could see the evil in some, including himself. The ensemble cast is so perfect that it's a wonder that the film didn't get more recognition. Yet the pillar of "Sling Blade" is Billy Bob Thornton. He doesn't perform acting, he's literally inhabited by the painful soul of Karl Childers, and he's so absorbing that we're always in the same wavelength. In one of the film's most significant moments, there is a violent argument between Doyle, Linda and Frank while Karl, almost comically, sits there and doesn't move. But look closely at his eyes, his mimics, his reactions when each object thrown by Frank hits Doyle or the wall. Karl is obviously disturbed as if he was witnessing the reminiscence of painful memories. And somewhat he looks determined to accomplish an act of existential gravity, something foreshadowed by the powerful moment when he grabs Doyle's arm and warns him to never lay a finger on little Frank. This very moment starts the countdown of Karl's freedom days. Although predictable, the conclusion doesn't diminish the film's emotional impact. Karl's actions are less eloquent than the last exchanges he had with each protagonist (including Doyle). They all say "Karl!" and keep silent while he leaves as if they resigned to a deadly omen. The film ends as it started, as if nothing changed. Karl sits in the same place, with the same expression; but this time, he refuses to listen to the pervert inmate and tells him straight in the eyes. Although he played a one-note character, Karl did change and for best. Once in his life, he did well by preventing a little child to endure the same hellish childhood. And I can't see but satisfaction in his eyes in the final, haunting shot.

    When I first watched "Sling Blade" about five years ago, I knew nothing about it and thought it was part of the Wesley Snipes vampire suckfest. I was completely unprepared for what has become my #1 favourite movie of all-time. Simply put, "Sling Blade" is the story of mentally-retarded Karl who gets released from "the nervous hospital" after 30 years, having committed a double murder as a young boy. He is taken in by an extremely trusting woman Linda and her young son Frank, who Karl befriends. This all takes place in what is surely one of the hillbilliest reddest-neck towns in Arkansas. To describe the story as big-hearted doesn't suffice, this story is ALL heart. In addition to the warm engaging characters of Karl, Linda and Frank, there's Linda's friend Vaughn, a closeted smalltown gay guy, and even the minor characters like doctors and mechanics are drawn as compassionate caring characters. This movie can remind you of all the good things human beings are capable of, even in dark circumstances. It's far from easy-viewing. Linda's abusive boyfriend Doyle is violent, manipulative, and threatens to destroy Linda and Frank. There are moments that are hard to watch (nothing graphic) and yet you can't turn your eyes away.

    Whenever there's a poll for the "Best Movie Ever Made", _Sling Blade_ should be a contender. It's a winner throughout its long runtime of 2.5 hours; it never bores, not even in the "Director's Cut" version in which previously cut 20 or so minutes are restored. It's a vehicle for the director, writer and main star of _Sling Blade_, Billy Bob Thornton -- and clearly he invested his life's most intense creative effort into this movie (expanded from an earlier short movie of 25 minutes), and all the effort paid off hugely. The acting is uniformly superb, starting with the ingenious creation of the leading character of Karl Childers; the distinctive speech, behaviour, and movement patters of this character are something that's likely to make you smile ever so often even after you get perfectly used to seeing them. It's like the boy says to Karl, "I like the way you talk," and Karl replies: "I like the way *you* talk." Indeed, this reverse is true as well; never has dialectal speech been captured on film more charmingly than Thornton's native Arkansas dialect in _Sling Blade_, so true to life it may sometimes be difficult, even for native English speakers, to understand what is being said, but you won't mind. Hardly anyone can pull off the trick of showing a grown man embracing a boy and saying, "I love you," with the boy replying, "I love you too," without this involving sexual connotations; but Thornton accomplishes the feat here; the relationship and friendship is portrayed as purely Platonic, that is non-sexual (as opposed to the original Greek concept). A huge accomplishment of _Sling Blade_ is on how many levels it is engaging: it's an engrossing, serious, and essentially brutal drama, but in many moments, it's also wonderful comedy; the dramatic and the comedic are often intertwined within the same scene. There's a delightful cameo by another genius film-maker, Jim Jarmusch, as the seller of "French fried potatoes", at the beginning of the movie; there's definitely a spiritual connection, if you will, between _Sling Blade_ and Jarmusch's work; _Sling Blade_ might well be a Jarmusch movie for all you know, and anyone who loves Jim Jarmusch movies will feel right at home in _Sling Blade_. (Speaking of cameos, let's also give credit to Robert Duvall for the few minutes he can be seen here!) Another astonishing achievement of _Sling Blade_ is that even though you have a pretty good idea about how the movie is going to end -- you don't really mind; it's suspenseful throughout. Watching the movie is likely to make you feel desperate, maddeningly helpless; or you might even become a misanthrope; because you realize that it is only through pure accident or lucky (?) chance that Karl was able to rescue (by questionable means) the mother & boy from the abusive live-in boyfriend (fabulously played by Dwight Yoakam: larger than life here, and more menacing than the repeat killer!). But how many abused families, wives, mothers, or children, are there around the world right now, and have been for centuries, and will be for many more centuries to come, yet with no Karl to come to *their* rescue? After you realize this, it really makes you despair of the human race. Especially after you realize that the suffering is at least partly self-inflicted: the mother brought the abuser's affections onto herself willingly, feeling unable to cope with her life situation on her own after her husband commits suicide due to lacking finances to support his family. That is another stinging aspect of _Sling Blade_: portraying the ridiculous materialistic divides between people, even those in their early teens; see the scene where the girl disdainfully speaks of the bouquet of flowers lovingly presented to her as coming "from a dollar store" and therefore being of inferior quality. Other cast members are great, too, particularly Lucas Black in the boy's role, and John Ritter as the overly sensitive -- or is it cowardly? -- but movingly humane dollar-store owner. Fantastic score by David Lanois, especially in the disjointed rock guitar riffs just prior to the murder scene; it's as if the music was mirroring the lead character's unclear state of mind, his decision-making process. It's fascinating that although we observe Karl Childers for 2.5 hours, he's not really a clear-cut, easily labelled person; we struggle, in classifying him, similarly to Vaughan when, in a funny episode, he believes Karl must have been thinking hard, philosophically, about something, although he was only thinking about food right then. And so, even though Karl is clearly mentally handicapped, in other ways he's a genius, representing a character surrounded by a world intrinsically foreign to him ("it's too big," he says at the end); the world at large is different from Karl -- and so anyone who feels estranged in their life situation, can sympathize with Karl; their fate is like that of Karl. And doesn't this apply to all geniuses, or in a sense: to all artists? This was incisively captured by Vaughan when he remarked that "being gay in this small town is like being handicapped"; but the same might be said of people whose intelligence much exceeds that of their surroundings: they will feel similarly estranged. Yet the world in _Sling Blade_ isn't depicted as black-and-white; funnily enough, the only colour eschewed is red (because Thornton dislikes it); otherwise, _Sling Blade_ shows the world and human beings as they are, in their complex entirety and self-contradicting facets: both beautiful (gorgeous backdrops of rural Arkansas!) and at the same time hideous; both cruel and stupid, and simultaneously compassionate and kind (see the warden and his family, or the Bill Cox character who cannot reconcile his "Christian conscience" with keeping Karl locked away for the night, handing him the keys on day 2).

    It was just pure luck I discovered this movie. But thanks to that greater power that I did so. I mean, I love Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, but seriously Academy take that thing back and give it to Thornton. Billy Bob Thornton. Genius. Unbelievable. In the first minutes I could not believe that the man playing Karl is Thornton. His voice alone puts you in a situation, that you want absolute silence, when you're watching the movie. His character makes you smile and cry at the same time... I needed 17 years to discover this movie. I do apologize. Mr.Thornton where are you hiding? No, seriously. Please take out everything you ever had in your mind for an movie and start shooting. Right away. I will see all of them.

    There's no question that without "Sling Blade" Billy Bob Thornton would not have the respect he has today as an artist, even though he's not particularly celebrated for his other films as a director, nor is he particularly admired for his musical career as a country singer/songwriter. Although no one can deny he has had a respectable and prolific acting career, "Sling Blade" definitely stands out as the most beautiful and heartfelt of all of his films. Karl is a middle aged, mentally challenged man who gets released from the mental institution he had been in since he was 12, for having killed his mother and her lover. Out in the real world for the first time in a long time, he soon meets a young kid, Frank, who together with his mother offers Karl a place in their home. However, living with them is Doyle, the mother's evil, alcoholic boyfriend, who is hostile and acts as a mean bully towards the entire family. Although at first it seems that Thornton is doing some overacting as the main protagonist, in the end he clearly is the man stealing the show every time, and creates an utterly memorable character the audience can fall in love with immediately. The power of the film lies in how straightforward and universal it is, even though it takes place in a very unique and specific area, the deep South of the United States. Its themes are about being dear to someone and loving them, and as consequence being able to sacrifice oneself for them. Karl's figure here, although a man with not much mystery (his dark past is immediately revealed, so there's not much else to discover) is almost a divine presence; in the scenes of domestic violence, he silently sits on the edge of the frame, passively witnessing the secretive horrors of abuse. The fact that he gets baptizes by his own will might even imply a Jesus-like figure. Then again, this is not a movie with hidden meanings and obscure symbolism: it's a somewhat Gothic, modern tale told with just as much darkness as tenderness.

    This is one BADASS film! I saw it for the first time 5 or 6 weeks ago. I was AMAZED; by the story, Billy Bob Badass's performance (he was acting, wasn't he?), the directing, the score & the performances of the entire cast, AND the fact that I hadn't seen nor heard of this movie until now. A friend (a long way)from South Carolina played this and two other flicks (Lawless & American History X) for me recently. I was blown away. But Sling Blade was, by far, the best! I have seen hundreds of movies and thousands of acting performances. This is some powerful stuff! This is among the very best. And Thornton.....well, Burton, Anthony Hopkins, Denzel, Jack, Pacino, Sir Lawrence, Sidney, Penn, Kilmer and all of the rest ain't got nothing on him. I don't say that lightly, but I say it all the same.

    Rarely does a film reach the level of perfection achieved by the great films ever made. The Godfather. Slumdog Millionaire. The Fugitive. The Shawshank Redemption. Field Of Dreams. Just to name a few. Sling Blade is one such film. In a career-best, mind-boggling effort, Billy Bob Thornton shines as the star, writer, and director of this amazing film. He plays a curious character named Karl Childers, who's just been released from a mental hospital in the deep south. Karl did something very, very bad many, many years ago, but decades of being institutionalized has weathered him some. He's been set up with a part-time job and a place to stay. At first, we're wondering if Karl can handle all of this. But when he excels at his job and befriends a young boy, Thornton begins a process in which he expounds upon the character of Karl Childers so skillfully, so tenderly, when we know it's Thornton at the helm of the whole thing, you have to be in awe. We grow, rather quickly, to like Karl, and that's the idea. He strikes a chord within us, somewhere deep and primal. And make no mistake, this is anything but an exploitation of the mentally disturbed or anyone else. No, it's a stirring, heartfelt, and heartbreaking portrayal of a man who seemed doomed to redeem himself. The film also benefits from spot-on supporting performances by the likes of Lucas Black, the boy whom Karl befriends, Natalie Canerday as the boy's mother, Dwight Yoakam as her heavy drinking, dim-witted boyfriend, and John Ritter as the mother's best friend. These performances are top-notch all the way around. But what makes it a "perfect" movie is the way Thornton allowed himself as writer, director, and star to explore the character. Karl is simple, but multi-layered. Thornton creates a growth within the character that is as sensible as it is spellbinding. It's a two-hour peak into a world few would imagine if they hadn't seen it, with southern lower-middle class people in a dusty town set against a backdrop of often gorgeous, lush bayou-type settings. It creates a feel, emotionally. One scene in particular, where Karl goes home for the first time in decades, only to find his babbling, accusatory father rotting away in his rocking chair (a brilliant cameo performance by Robert Duvall), is performed with such a brilliant display of poignancy that we're left to wonder what the hell happened to Thornton in the years since this film. While I loved him in The Man Who Wasn't There, I hated him in Armageddon, and Bad Santa, and Mr. Woodcock, and just about everything else I've seen him in since. Those movies may have their moments, in the right time or place, but Sling Blade is timeless, and light years ahead of the vast majority of his other films. In fact, we're not even sure what year it takes place, and it doesn't matter. The mother's boyfriend, who doesn't like Karl or the Ritter character because he's gay, becomes increasingly confrontational and controlling. We feel fearful of what might happen. The bittersweet ending pulls no punches and plays no tricks; we practically expect it, but can't help being engrossed by it. Sling Blade is remarkable film everyone above the age of say, 16, should see. It's touching and powerful, and it's movie magic.

    Sling Blade gets very close to deliver what is promises, "unmistakable drama". Billy Bob's dream project, it shows how passionately and thoughtfully he has pursued it and created a very impressive piece of work. Billy Bob has written, directed and acted the protagonist in the movie of which the latter two are clear winners. Acting: Billy Bob is an amazing actor and it is expected of him to deliver good performance but in 'Karl' he has created an inconceivably beautiful character, I don't like to compare but if it helps you scale, he has become 'Karl' as much as Robert De Niro had become 'Leonard Lowe' in 'Awakenings' and Dustin Hoffman had become 'Raymond Babbitt' in 'Rain Man'. He has created a modern classic protagonist in 'Karl' 10/10 Others have done an above average job which is a shame given that Billy Bob was creating a masterpiece, it would have been great to have others deliver their best too. This makes the whole story slightly weaker and less convincing. Direction: This film doesn't prick you with cheap tricks, it brims ever so nicely with slow intensity, scene after scene, unfolding small events, revealing characters. It creates a piece of life which is real. At no point, this movie imitates it's inspiration, not a single scene is meaningless which tells me the editing is also top class. It makes me want to ask Billy to direct more movies. He has the gift of being honest, real and dispassionate, which I believe is the top most quality of a true director. Script: This is where the great attempt fails and why 'Sling Blade' will not be among the very best of all time. The script is clearly confused between it's innocently presumed hidden yet bare attempt to reveal a complex moral view and the belief and resolution of a single man, in the tussle, the movie is defeated and it completes no meaning which is beautiful in it's own way though it would have otherwise been masterly. Please watch this one urgently!

We meet Karl on the day he leaves a mental hospital; he doesn't talk first, forcing himself to listen to one of the inmate's disgusting anecdotes while he stares at the widow.

He talks in the dark, uninterrupted, striking by his raspy voice, colossal jaw and strange rubbing-hands habit highlighting a social unease. His words are punctuated by a weird sound, a "Mm-hmm" growl.

I loved watching the film again, just to see Karl ordering French fries in a burger restaurant: "I reckon I likes me some French fried potaters, mm-hmm". Some people would call it a 'guilty pleasure', it is but it never distracts from the core of the film, which starts with the rediscovery of freedom by a man of limited intelligence and ends with a poignant sacrifice. In between, "Sling Blade" takes us in a small word of bleak simplicity, nothing much happens, people mind their own business, work to pay the bills, and even a man like Karl can find his place if he has, for instance, a certain ability to fix lawnmowers and whatnot. There's a very smoothly handled straightforwardness in Thornton's script, allowing each important character to touch us directly as if it was an old acquaintance. Karl befriends a little boy named Frank and their fondness is as mutual as immediate. It's the kind of genuine friendships that don't need long set-ups, Frank simply 'loves the way Karl talks', and which child wouldn't? He asks his mother if Karl can live in the garage, she accepts. It feels realistic precisely because Linda is the kind of woman who sees good in everyone, and proves it through her boyfriend, an abusive loser played by Dwight Yoakam, and as others mentioned, the second best performance in the film, Oscar-worthy in every level. Doyle is the kind of wannabe rock-star who never got his break and vents his angry frustration on Frank by pretending to be a fatherly figure on the authority department. Otherwise, he spends most of his time lounging on the sofa, drinking beer, bullying Frank and challenging Linda's patience... he doesn't fool anyone. And within this world, Karl acts as a quiet observant. His passiveness mirrors the attitude of the fifth important character in the film, Linda's friend Vaughan, a homosexual forced to live in the town for easily guessable reasons. As a potential victim of intolerance, Vaughan is able to read through Karl's deadpan expression the hints of some inconsolable wounds, and no matter how tough they were, they certainly built an inner goodness in his heart. But Vaughan isn't a "guy" guy and can't fight a man like Doyle, but Karl can help him to take care of Linda and Frank, both would be like guardian angels. John Ritter delivers a magnificent performance in all nuance and subtlety as a man with great humanistic intuition. And indeed, the storyline concurs with Vaughan and we get more insights about Karl's tormented childhood. Karl is a man of good heart who learned to find the good in anyone because he could see the evil in some, including himself. The ensemble cast is so perfect that it's a wonder that the film didn't get more recognition. Yet the pillar of "Sling Blade" is Billy Bob Thornton. He doesn't perform acting, he's literally inhabited by the painful soul of Karl Childers, and he's so absorbing that we're always in the same wavelength. In one of the film's most significant moments, there is a violent argument between Doyle, Linda and Frank while Karl, almost comically, sits there and doesn't move. But look closely at his eyes, his mimics, his reactions when each object thrown by Frank hits Doyle or the wall. Karl is obviously disturbed as if he was witnessing the reminiscence of painful memories. And somewhat he looks determined to accomplish an act of existential gravity, something foreshadowed by the powerful moment when he grabs Doyle's arm and warns him to never lay a finger on little Frank. This very moment starts the countdown of Karl's freedom days. Although predictable, the conclusion doesn't diminish the film's emotional impact. Karl's actions are less eloquent than the last exchanges he had with each protagonist (including Doyle). They all say "Karl!" and keep silent while he leaves as if they resigned to a deadly omen. The film ends as it started, as if nothing changed. Karl sits in the same place, with the same expression; but this time, he refuses to listen to the pervert inmate and tells him straight in the eyes. Although he played a one-note character, Karl did change and for best. Once in his life, he did well by preventing a little child to endure the same hellish childhood. And I can't see but satisfaction in his eyes in the final, haunting shot.

    When I first watched "Sling Blade" about five years ago, I knew nothing about it and thought it was part of the Wesley Snipes vampire suckfest. I was completely unprepared for what has become my #1 favourite movie of all-time. Simply put, "Sling Blade" is the story of mentally-retarded Karl who gets released from "the nervous hospital" after 30 years, having committed a double murder as a young boy. He is taken in by an extremely trusting woman Linda and her young son Frank, who Karl befriends. This all takes place in what is surely one of the hillbilliest reddest-neck towns in Arkansas. To describe the story as big-hearted doesn't suffice, this story is ALL heart. In addition to the warm engaging characters of Karl, Linda and Frank, there's Linda's friend Vaughn, a closeted smalltown gay guy, and even the minor characters like doctors and mechanics are drawn as compassionate caring characters. This movie can remind you of all the good things human beings are capable of, even in dark circumstances. It's far from easy-viewing. Linda's abusive boyfriend Doyle is violent, manipulative, and threatens to destroy Linda and Frank. There are moments that are hard to watch (nothing graphic) and yet you can't turn your eyes away.

    Whenever there's a poll for the "Best Movie Ever Made", _Sling Blade_ should be a contender. It's a winner throughout its long runtime of 2.5 hours; it never bores, not even in the "Director's Cut" version in which previously cut 20 or so minutes are restored. It's a vehicle for the director, writer and main star of _Sling Blade_, Billy Bob Thornton -- and clearly he invested his life's most intense creative effort into this movie (expanded from an earlier short movie of 25 minutes), and all the effort paid off hugely. The acting is uniformly superb, starting with the ingenious creation of the leading character of Karl Childers; the distinctive speech, behaviour, and movement patters of this character are something that's likely to make you smile ever so often even after you get perfectly used to seeing them. It's like the boy says to Karl, "I like the way you talk," and Karl replies: "I like the way *you* talk." Indeed, this reverse is true as well; never has dialectal speech been captured on film more charmingly than Thornton's native Arkansas dialect in _Sling Blade_, so true to life it may sometimes be difficult, even for native English speakers, to understand what is being said, but you won't mind. Hardly anyone can pull off the trick of showing a grown man embracing a boy and saying, "I love you," with the boy replying, "I love you too," without this involving sexual connotations; but Thornton accomplishes the feat here; the relationship and friendship is portrayed as purely Platonic, that is non-sexual (as opposed to the original Greek concept). A huge accomplishment of _Sling Blade_ is on how many levels it is engaging: it's an engrossing, serious, and essentially brutal drama, but in many moments, it's also wonderful comedy; the dramatic and the comedic are often intertwined within the same scene. There's a delightful cameo by another genius film-maker, Jim Jarmusch, as the seller of "French fried potatoes", at the beginning of the movie; there's definitely a spiritual connection, if you will, between _Sling Blade_ and Jarmusch's work; _Sling Blade_ might well be a Jarmusch movie for all you know, and anyone who loves Jim Jarmusch movies will feel right at home in _Sling Blade_. (Speaking of cameos, let's also give credit to Robert Duvall for the few minutes he can be seen here!) Another astonishing achievement of _Sling Blade_ is that even though you have a pretty good idea about how the movie is going to end -- you don't really mind; it's suspenseful throughout. Watching the movie is likely to make you feel desperate, maddeningly helpless; or you might even become a misanthrope; because you realize that it is only through pure accident or lucky (?) chance that Karl was able to rescue (by questionable means) the mother & boy from the abusive live-in boyfriend (fabulously played by Dwight Yoakam: larger than life here, and more menacing than the repeat killer!). But how many abused families, wives, mothers, or children, are there around the world right now, and have been for centuries, and will be for many more centuries to come, yet with no Karl to come to *their* rescue? After you realize this, it really makes you despair of the human race. Especially after you realize that the suffering is at least partly self-inflicted: the mother brought the abuser's affections onto herself willingly, feeling unable to cope with her life situation on her own after her husband commits suicide due to lacking finances to support his family. That is another stinging aspect of _Sling Blade_: portraying the ridiculous materialistic divides between people, even those in their early teens; see the scene where the girl disdainfully speaks of the bouquet of flowers lovingly presented to her as coming "from a dollar store" and therefore being of inferior quality. Other cast members are great, too, particularly Lucas Black in the boy's role, and John Ritter as the overly sensitive -- or is it cowardly? -- but movingly humane dollar-store owner. Fantastic score by David Lanois, especially in the disjointed rock guitar riffs just prior to the murder scene; it's as if the music was mirroring the lead character's unclear state of mind, his decision-making process. It's fascinating that although we observe Karl Childers for 2.5 hours, he's not really a clear-cut, easily labelled person; we struggle, in classifying him, similarly to Vaughan when, in a funny episode, he believes Karl must have been thinking hard, philosophically, about something, although he was only thinking about food right then. And so, even though Karl is clearly mentally handicapped, in other ways he's a genius, representing a character surrounded by a world intrinsically foreign to him ("it's too big," he says at the end); the world at large is different from Karl -- and so anyone who feels estranged in their life situation, can sympathize with Karl; their fate is like that of Karl. And doesn't this apply to all geniuses, or in a sense: to all artists? This was incisively captured by Vaughan when he remarked that "being gay in this small town is like being handicapped"; but the same might be said of people whose intelligence much exceeds that of their surroundings: they will feel similarly estranged. Yet the world in _Sling Blade_ isn't depicted as black-and-white; funnily enough, the only colour eschewed is red (because Thornton dislikes it); otherwise, _Sling Blade_ shows the world and human beings as they are, in their complex entirety and self-contradicting facets: both beautiful (gorgeous backdrops of rural Arkansas!) and at the same time hideous; both cruel and stupid, and simultaneously compassionate and kind (see the warden and his family, or the Bill Cox character who cannot reconcile his "Christian conscience" with keeping Karl locked away for the night, handing him the keys on day 2).

    It was just pure luck I discovered this movie. But thanks to that greater power that I did so. I mean, I love Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, but seriously Academy take that thing back and give it to Thornton. Billy Bob Thornton. Genius. Unbelievable. In the first minutes I could not believe that the man playing Karl is Thornton. His voice alone puts you in a situation, that you want absolute silence, when you're watching the movie. His character makes you smile and cry at the same time... I needed 17 years to discover this movie. I do apologize. Mr.Thornton where are you hiding? No, seriously. Please take out everything you ever had in your mind for an movie and start shooting. Right away. I will see all of them.

    There's no question that without "Sling Blade" Billy Bob Thornton would not have the respect he has today as an artist, even though he's not particularly celebrated for his other films as a director, nor is he particularly admired for his musical career as a country singer/songwriter. Although no one can deny he has had a respectable and prolific acting career, "Sling Blade" definitely stands out as the most beautiful and heartfelt of all of his films. Karl is a middle aged, mentally challenged man who gets released from the mental institution he had been in since he was 12, for having killed his mother and her lover. Out in the real world for the first time in a long time, he soon meets a young kid, Frank, who together with his mother offers Karl a place in their home. However, living with them is Doyle, the mother's evil, alcoholic boyfriend, who is hostile and acts as a mean bully towards the entire family. Although at first it seems that Thornton is doing some overacting as the main protagonist, in the end he clearly is the man stealing the show every time, and creates an utterly memorable character the audience can fall in love with immediately. The power of the film lies in how straightforward and universal it is, even though it takes place in a very unique and specific area, the deep South of the United States. Its themes are about being dear to someone and loving them, and as consequence being able to sacrifice oneself for them. Karl's figure here, although a man with not much mystery (his dark past is immediately revealed, so there's not much else to discover) is almost a divine presence; in the scenes of domestic violence, he silently sits on the edge of the frame, passively witnessing the secretive horrors of abuse. The fact that he gets baptizes by his own will might even imply a Jesus-like figure. Then again, this is not a movie with hidden meanings and obscure symbolism: it's a somewhat Gothic, modern tale told with just as much darkness as tenderness.

    This is one BADASS film! I saw it for the first time 5 or 6 weeks ago. I was AMAZED; by the story, Billy Bob Badass's performance (he was acting, wasn't he?), the directing, the score & the performances of the entire cast, AND the fact that I hadn't seen nor heard of this movie until now. A friend (a long way)from South Carolina played this and two other flicks (Lawless & American History X) for me recently. I was blown away. But Sling Blade was, by far, the best! I have seen hundreds of movies and thousands of acting performances. This is some powerful stuff! This is among the very best. And Thornton.....well, Burton, Anthony Hopkins, Denzel, Jack, Pacino, Sir Lawrence, Sidney, Penn, Kilmer and all of the rest ain't got nothing on him. I don't say that lightly, but I say it all the same.

    Rarely does a film reach the level of perfection achieved by the great films ever made. The Godfather. Slumdog Millionaire. The Fugitive. The Shawshank Redemption. Field Of Dreams. Just to name a few. Sling Blade is one such film. In a career-best, mind-boggling effort, Billy Bob Thornton shines as the star, writer, and director of this amazing film. He plays a curious character named Karl Childers, who's just been released from a mental hospital in the deep south. Karl did something very, very bad many, many years ago, but decades of being institutionalized has weathered him some. He's been set up with a part-time job and a place to stay. At first, we're wondering if Karl can handle all of this. But when he excels at his job and befriends a young boy, Thornton begins a process in which he expounds upon the character of Karl Childers so skillfully, so tenderly, when we know it's Thornton at the helm of the whole thing, you have to be in awe. We grow, rather quickly, to like Karl, and that's the idea. He strikes a chord within us, somewhere deep and primal. And make no mistake, this is anything but an exploitation of the mentally disturbed or anyone else. No, it's a stirring, heartfelt, and heartbreaking portrayal of a man who seemed doomed to redeem himself. The film also benefits from spot-on supporting performances by the likes of Lucas Black, the boy whom Karl befriends, Natalie Canerday as the boy's mother, Dwight Yoakam as her heavy drinking, dim-witted boyfriend, and John Ritter as the mother's best friend. These performances are top-notch all the way around. But what makes it a "perfect" movie is the way Thornton allowed himself as writer, director, and star to explore the character. Karl is simple, but multi-layered. Thornton creates a growth within the character that is as sensible as it is spellbinding. It's a two-hour peak into a world few would imagine if they hadn't seen it, with southern lower-middle class people in a dusty town set against a backdrop of often gorgeous, lush bayou-type settings. It creates a feel, emotionally. One scene in particular, where Karl goes home for the first time in decades, only to find his babbling, accusatory father rotting away in his rocking chair (a brilliant cameo performance by Robert Duvall), is performed with such a brilliant display of poignancy that we're left to wonder what the hell happened to Thornton in the years since this film. While I loved him in The Man Who Wasn't There, I hated him in Armageddon, and Bad Santa, and Mr. Woodcock, and just about everything else I've seen him in since. Those movies may have their moments, in the right time or place, but Sling Blade is timeless, and light years ahead of the vast majority of his other films. In fact, we're not even sure what year it takes place, and it doesn't matter. The mother's boyfriend, who doesn't like Karl or the Ritter character because he's gay, becomes increasingly confrontational and controlling. We feel fearful of what might happen. The bittersweet ending pulls no punches and plays no tricks; we practically expect it, but can't help being engrossed by it. Sling Blade is remarkable film everyone above the age of say, 16, should see. It's touching and powerful, and it's movie magic.

    Sling Blade gets very close to deliver what is promises, "unmistakable drama". Billy Bob's dream project, it shows how passionately and thoughtfully he has pursued it and created a very impressive piece of work. Billy Bob has written, directed and acted the protagonist in the movie of which the latter two are clear winners. Acting: Billy Bob is an amazing actor and it is expected of him to deliver good performance but in 'Karl' he has created an inconceivably beautiful character, I don't like to compare but if it helps you scale, he has become 'Karl' as much as Robert De Niro had become 'Leonard Lowe' in 'Awakenings' and Dustin Hoffman had become 'Raymond Babbitt' in 'Rain Man'. He has created a modern classic protagonist in 'Karl' 10/10 Others have done an above average job which is a shame given that Billy Bob was creating a masterpiece, it would have been great to have others deliver their best too. This makes the whole story slightly weaker and less convincing. Direction: This film doesn't prick you with cheap tricks, it brims ever so nicely with slow intensity, scene after scene, unfolding small events, revealing characters. It creates a piece of life which is real. At no point, this movie imitates it's inspiration, not a single scene is meaningless which tells me the editing is also top class. It makes me want to ask Billy to direct more movies. He has the gift of being honest, real and dispassionate, which I believe is the top most quality of a true director. Script: This is where the great attempt fails and why 'Sling Blade' will not be among the very best of all time. The script is clearly confused between it's innocently presumed hidden yet bare attempt to reveal a complex moral view and the belief and resolution of a single man, in the tussle, the movie is defeated and it completes no meaning which is beautiful in it's own way though it would have otherwise been masterly. Please watch this one urgently!

    Concerned with some of the dark pits of the human soul, Sling Blade is an interesting and emotionally captivating movie to watch. It is a demonstration of how ill behaviour can cause violence to surge up in human relationships... At the same time, Sling Blade points out some socially sensitive truths about the rights of the mentally disabled, as well as the immaturity that (still) exists in our society, regarding how society views them. The viewer cannot help but feel attached to Karl, the mentally disabled protagonist of the story, within the first couple of minutes. Indeed, the acting is great, especially considering that the roles played are not typical ones. There are, however, some flaws in the plot... for example, I cannot believe that Doyle just sat there, pathetically reading his newspaper, waiting to get hit in the head by a lawnmower blade... Even for someone who disrespects and looks down his nose to "retards", I believe that he should have felt at least a bit threatened (this also contradicts his anxiety because of Karl's earlier nightly walk with a hammer). In addition, I just cannot accept that the boy, Frank, took orders from Doyle without resenting and only limited himself to throwing some angry looks. It just doesn't make sense... Also, I don't think that mentally ill people who have been treated and then released back into society would just live without any supervision... I can forgive, at least to some extent, the aforementioned mistakes, since the acting was so great and really convincing... Nevertheless, I don't think Sling Blade is going to stay with me for a long time... It was moving, emotionally intense, and thought-provoking, but it lacked impressiveness. All in all, I would encourage you to watch the movie if you enjoy the genre.

    I lot of people seem to be down on Thorton for his role in this, but I cannot at all understand that. The point is - the acting, Karl is a 100% believable character. Sure, some may find his voice or mannerisms annoying, personally I did not at all, I found it to add to his character perfectly. The acting in this movie is quite excellent, most other movies don't come close at all, so many of these characters just 'jump out' at you and are totally believable. The beauty of this is that we all know a 'Linda' or a 'Doyle', and maybe a 'Vaughn' - but Karl? Few of us know someone with such a heart, but dealt such a bad hand in life. It fits perfectly with the plight of humanity; some people are gifted with piles of talent and intelligence, but waste it on violence and cheap thrills. Others have next to none, but make the very best of it that they can. Excellent film, either way - give it a chance if you like an excellent drama.

    "Sling Blade" is one of these genuine masterpieces that immediately take you off-guard. As soon as Karl Childers, the central character played by Billy Bob Thornton, starts talking, we know we're unto something new, original and unique. We meet Karl on the day he leaves a mental hospital; he doesn't talk first, forcing himself to listen to one of the inmate's disgusting anecdotes while he stares at the widow. His turn to speak comes when he describes to a young interviewer how he killed his mother and her lover with a Kaiser blade ("some call it a sling blade"). He was a child then and spent a long period trying to socially readjusting himself, mostly through reading Bible, not that he understands a great deal of it, but enough to reckon that people shouldn't kill each other. He talks in the dark, uninterrupted, striking by his raspy voice, colossal jaw and strange rubbing-hands habit highlighting a social unease. His words are punctuated by a weird sound, a "Mm-hmm" growl. Karl easily reminds of Forrest Gump, another mentally challenged character with specific mimics and mannerisms, but he never feels like an imitation, he IS an original and quite memorable creation. And after ten minutes, positive expectations started to invade my thoughts, a movie opening with such an original character and gripping monologue could only lead to cinematic greatness and nothing in the film ever belied my expectations. Thornton didn't just tell a story, he delivered a performance of hypnotic weirdness, enjoyable on a primary level. I loved watching the film again, just to see Karl ordering French fries in a burger restaurant: "I reckon I likes me some French fried potaters, mm-hmm". Some people would call it a 'guilty pleasure', it is but it never distracts from the core of the film, which starts with the rediscovery of freedom by a man of limited intelligence and ends with a poignant sacrifice. In between, "Sling Blade" takes us in a small word of bleak simplicity, nothing much happens, people mind their own business, work to pay the bills, and even a man like Karl can find his place if he has, for instance, a certain ability to fix lawnmowers and whatnot. There's a very smoothly handled straightforwardness in Thornton's script, allowing each important character to touch us directly as if it was an old acquaintance. Karl befriends a little boy named Frank and their fondness is as mutual as immediate. It's the kind of genuine friendships that don't need long set-ups, Frank simply 'loves the way Karl talks', and which child wouldn't? He asks his mother if Karl can live in the garage, she accepts. It feels realistic precisely because Linda is the kind of woman who sees good in everyone, and proves it through her boyfriend, an abusive loser played by Dwight Yoakam, and as others mentioned, the second best performance in the film, Oscar-worthy in every level. Doyle is the kind of wannabe rock-star who never got his break and vents his angry frustration on Frank by pretending to be a fatherly figure on the authority department. Otherwise, he spends most of his time lounging on the sofa, drinking beer, bullying Frank and challenging Linda's patience... he doesn't fool anyone. And within this world, Karl acts as a quiet observant. His passiveness mirrors the attitude of the fifth important character in the film, Linda's friend Vaughan, a homosexual forced to live in the town for easily guessable reasons. As a potential victim of intolerance, Vaughan is able to read through Karl's deadpan expression the hints of some inconsolable wounds, and no matter how tough they were, they certainly built an inner goodness in his heart. But Vaughan isn't a "guy" guy and can't fight a man like Doyle, but Karl can help him to take care of Linda and Frank, both would be like guardian angels. John Ritter delivers a magnificent performance in all nuance and subtlety as a man with great humanistic intuition. And indeed, the storyline concurs with Vaughan and we get more insights about Karl's tormented childhood. Karl is a man of good heart who learned to find the good in anyone because he could see the evil in some, including himself. The ensemble cast is so perfect that it's a wonder that the film didn't get more recognition. Yet the pillar of "Sling Blade" is Billy Bob Thornton. He doesn't perform acting, he's literally inhabited by the painful soul of Karl Childers, and he's so absorbing that we're always in the same wavelength. In one of the film's most significant moments, there is a violent argument between Doyle, Linda and Frank while Karl, almost comically, sits there and doesn't move. But look closely at his eyes, his mimics, his reactions when each object thrown by Frank hits Doyle or the wall. Karl is obviously disturbed as if he was witnessing the reminiscence of painful memories. And somewhat he looks determined to accomplish an act of existential gravity, something foreshadowed by the powerful moment when he grabs Doyle's arm and warns him to never lay a finger on little Frank. This very moment starts the countdown of Karl's freedom days. Although predictable, the conclusion doesn't diminish the film's emotional impact. Karl's actions are less eloquent than the last exchanges he had with each protagonist (including Doyle). They all say "Karl!" and keep silent while he leaves as if they resigned to a deadly omen. The film ends as it started, as if nothing changed. Karl sits in the same place, with the same expression; but this time, he refuses to listen to the pervert inmate and tells him straight in the eyes. Although he played a one-note character, Karl did change and for best. Once in his life, he did well by preventing a little child to endure the same hellish childhood. And I can't see but satisfaction in his eyes in the final, haunting shot.

    Whenever there's a poll for the "Best Movie Ever Made", _Sling Blade_ should be a contender. It's a winner throughout its long runtime of 2.5 hours; it never bores, not even in the "Director's Cut" version in which previously cut 20 or so minutes are restored. It's a vehicle for the director, writer and main star of _Sling Blade_, Billy Bob Thornton -- and clearly he invested his life's most intense creative effort into this movie (expanded from an earlier short movie of 25 minutes), and all the effort paid off hugely. The acting is uniformly superb, starting with the ingenious creation of the leading character of Karl Childers; the distinctive speech, behaviour, and movement patters of this character are something that's likely to make you smile ever so often even after you get perfectly used to seeing them. It's like the boy says to Karl, "I like the way you talk," and Karl replies: "I like the way *you* talk." Indeed, this reverse is true as well; never has dialectal speech been captured on film more charmingly than Thornton's native Arkansas dialect in _Sling Blade_, so true to life it may sometimes be difficult, even for native English speakers, to understand what is being said, but you won't mind. Hardly anyone can pull off the trick of showing a grown man embracing a boy and saying, "I love you," with the boy replying, "I love you too," without this involving sexual connotations; but Thornton accomplishes the feat here; the relationship and friendship is portrayed as purely Platonic, that is non-sexual (as opposed to the original Greek concept). A huge accomplishment of _Sling Blade_ is on how many levels it is engaging: it's an engrossing, serious, and essentially brutal drama, but in many moments, it's also wonderful comedy; the dramatic and the comedic are often intertwined within the same scene. There's a delightful cameo by another genius film-maker, Jim Jarmusch, as the seller of "French fried potatoes", at the beginning of the movie; there's definitely a spiritual connection, if you will, between _Sling Blade_ and Jarmusch's work; _Sling Blade_ might well be a Jarmusch movie for all you know, and anyone who loves Jim Jarmusch movies will feel right at home in _Sling Blade_. (Speaking of cameos, let's also give credit to Robert Duvall for the few minutes he can be seen here!) Another astonishing achievement of _Sling Blade_ is that even though you have a pretty good idea about how the movie is going to end -- you don't really mind; it's suspenseful throughout. Watching the movie is likely to make you feel desperate, maddeningly helpless; or you might even become a misanthrope; because you realize that it is only through pure accident or lucky (?) chance that Karl was able to rescue (by questionable means) the mother & boy from the abusive live-in boyfriend (fabulously played by Dwight Yoakam: larger than life here, and more menacing than the repeat killer!). But how many abused families, wives, mothers, or children, are there around the world right now, and have been for centuries, and will be for many more centuries to come, yet with no Karl to come to *their* rescue? After you realize this, it really makes you despair of the human race. Especially after you realize that the suffering is at least partly self-inflicted: the mother brought the abuser's affections onto herself willingly, feeling unable to cope with her life situation on her own after her husband commits suicide due to lacking finances to support his family. That is another stinging aspect of _Sling Blade_: portraying the ridiculous materialistic divides between people, even those in their early teens; see the scene where the girl disdainfully speaks of the bouquet of flowers lovingly presented to her as coming "from a dollar store" and therefore being of inferior quality. Other cast members are great, too, particularly Lucas Black in the boy's role, and John Ritter as the overly sensitive -- or is it cowardly? -- but movingly humane dollar-store owner. Fantastic score by David Lanois, especially in the disjointed rock guitar riffs just prior to the murder scene; it's as if the music was mirroring the lead character's unclear state of mind, his decision-making process. It's fascinating that although we observe Karl Childers for 2.5 hours, he's not really a clear-cut, easily labelled person; we struggle, in classifying him, similarly to Vaughan when, in a funny episode, he believes Karl must have been thinking hard, philosophically, about something, although he was only thinking about food right then. And so, even though Karl is clearly mentally handicapped, in other ways he's a genius, representing a character surrounded by a world intrinsically foreign to him ("it's too big," he says at the end); the world at large is different from Karl -- and so anyone who feels estranged in their life situation, can sympathize with Karl; their fate is like that of Karl. And doesn't this apply to all geniuses, or in a sense: to all artists? This was incisively captured by Vaughan when he remarked that "being gay in this small town is like being handicapped"; but the same might be said of people whose intelligence much exceeds that of their surroundings: they will feel similarly estranged. Yet the world in _Sling Blade_ isn't depicted as black-and-white; funnily enough, the only colour eschewed is red (because Thornton dislikes it); otherwise, _Sling Blade_ shows the world and human beings as they are, in their complex entirety and self-contradicting facets: both beautiful (gorgeous backdrops of rural Arkansas!) and at the same time hideous; both cruel and stupid, and simultaneously compassionate and kind (see the warden and his family, or the Bill Cox character who cannot reconcile his "Christian conscience" with keeping Karl locked away for the night, handing him the keys on day 2).

    It was just pure luck I discovered this movie. But thanks to that greater power that I did so. I mean, I love Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, but seriously Academy take that thing back and give it to Thornton. Billy Bob Thornton. Genius. Unbelievable. In the first minutes I could not believe that the man playing Karl is Thornton. His voice alone puts you in a situation, that you want absolute silence, when you're watching the movie. His character makes you smile and cry at the same time... I needed 17 years to discover this movie. I do apologize. Mr.Thornton where are you hiding? No, seriously. Please take out everything you ever had in your mind for an movie and start shooting. Right away. I will see all of them.

    There's no question that without "Sling Blade" Billy Bob Thornton would not have the respect he has today as an artist, even though he's not particularly celebrated for his other films as a director, nor is he particularly admired for his musical career as a country singer/songwriter. Although no one can deny he has had a respectable and prolific acting career, "Sling Blade" definitely stands out as the most beautiful and heartfelt of all of his films. Karl is a middle aged, mentally challenged man who gets released from the mental institution he had been in since he was 12, for having killed his mother and her lover. Out in the real world for the first time in a long time, he soon meets a young kid, Frank, who together with his mother offers Karl a place in their home. However, living with them is Doyle, the mother's evil, alcoholic boyfriend, who is hostile and acts as a mean bully towards the entire family. Although at first it seems that Thornton is doing some overacting as the main protagonist, in the end he clearly is the man stealing the show every time, and creates an utterly memorable character the audience can fall in love with immediately. The power of the film lies in how straightforward and universal it is, even though it takes place in a very unique and specific area, the deep South of the United States. Its themes are about being dear to someone and loving them, and as consequence being able to sacrifice oneself for them. Karl's figure here, although a man with not much mystery (his dark past is immediately revealed, so there's not much else to discover) is almost a divine presence; in the scenes of domestic violence, he silently sits on the edge of the frame, passively witnessing the secretive horrors of abuse. The fact that he gets baptizes by his own will might even imply a Jesus-like figure. Then again, this is not a movie with hidden meanings and obscure symbolism: it's a somewhat Gothic, modern tale told with just as much darkness as tenderness.

    This is one BADASS film! I saw it for the first time 5 or 6 weeks ago. I was AMAZED; by the story, Billy Bob Badass's performance (he was acting, wasn't he?), the directing, the score & the performances of the entire cast, AND the fact that I hadn't seen nor heard of this movie until now. A friend (a long way)from South Carolina played this and two other flicks (Lawless & American History X) for me recently. I was blown away. But Sling Blade was, by far, the best! I have seen hundreds of movies and thousands of acting performances. This is some powerful stuff! This is among the very best. And Thornton.....well, Burton, Anthony Hopkins, Denzel, Jack, Pacino, Sir Lawrence, Sidney, Penn, Kilmer and all of the rest ain't got nothing on him. I don't say that lightly, but I say it all the same.

    Rarely does a film reach the level of perfection achieved by the great films ever made. The Godfather. Slumdog Millionaire. The Fugitive. The Shawshank Redemption. Field Of Dreams. Just to name a few. Sling Blade is one such film. In a career-best, mind-boggling effort, Billy Bob Thornton shines as the star, writer, and director of this amazing film. He plays a curious character named Karl Childers, who's just been released from a mental hospital in the deep south. Karl did something very, very bad many, many years ago, but decades of being institutionalized has weathered him some. He's been set up with a part-time job and a place to stay. At first, we're wondering if Karl can handle all of this. But when he excels at his job and befriends a young boy, Thornton begins a process in which he expounds upon the character of Karl Childers so skillfully, so tenderly, when we know it's Thornton at the helm of the whole thing, you have to be in awe. We grow, rather quickly, to like Karl, and that's the idea. He strikes a chord within us, somewhere deep and primal. And make no mistake, this is anything but an exploitation of the mentally disturbed or anyone else. No, it's a stirring, heartfelt, and heartbreaking portrayal of a man who seemed doomed to redeem himself. The film also benefits from spot-on supporting performances by the likes of Lucas Black, the boy whom Karl befriends, Natalie Canerday as the boy's mother, Dwight Yoakam as her heavy drinking, dim-witted boyfriend, and John Ritter as the mother's best friend. These performances are top-notch all the way around. But what makes it a "perfect" movie is the way Thornton allowed himself as writer, director, and star to explore the character. Karl is simple, but multi-layered. Thornton creates a growth within the character that is as sensible as it is spellbinding. It's a two-hour peak into a world few would imagine if they hadn't seen it, with southern lower-middle class people in a dusty town set against a backdrop of often gorgeous, lush bayou-type settings. It creates a feel, emotionally. One scene in particular, where Karl goes home for the first time in decades, only to find his babbling, accusatory father rotting away in his rocking chair (a brilliant cameo performance by Robert Duvall), is performed with such a brilliant display of poignancy that we're left to wonder what the hell happened to Thornton in the years since this film. While I loved him in The Man Who Wasn't There, I hated him in Armageddon, and Bad Santa, and Mr. Woodcock, and just about everything else I've seen him in since. Those movies may have their moments, in the right time or place, but Sling Blade is timeless, and light years ahead of the vast majority of his other films. In fact, we're not even sure what year it takes place, and it doesn't matter. The mother's boyfriend, who doesn't like Karl or the Ritter character because he's gay, becomes increasingly confrontational and controlling. We feel fearful of what might happen. The bittersweet ending pulls no punches and plays no tricks; we practically expect it, but can't help being engrossed by it. Sling Blade is remarkable film everyone above the age of say, 16, should see. It's touching and powerful, and it's movie magic.

    Sling Blade gets very close to deliver what is promises, "unmistakable drama". Billy Bob's dream project, it shows how passionately and thoughtfully he has pursued it and created a very impressive piece of work. Billy Bob has written, directed and acted the protagonist in the movie of which the latter two are clear winners. Acting: Billy Bob is an amazing actor and it is expected of him to deliver good performance but in 'Karl' he has created an inconceivably beautiful character, I don't like to compare but if it helps you scale, he has become 'Karl' as much as Robert De Niro had become 'Leonard Lowe' in 'Awakenings' and Dustin Hoffman had become 'Raymond Babbitt' in 'Rain Man'. He has created a modern classic protagonist in 'Karl' 10/10 Others have done an above average job which is a shame given that Billy Bob was creating a masterpiece, it would have been great to have others deliver their best too. This makes the whole story slightly weaker and less convincing. Direction: This film doesn't prick you with cheap tricks, it brims ever so nicely with slow intensity, scene after scene, unfolding small events, revealing characters. It creates a piece of life which is real. At no point, this movie imitates it's inspiration, not a single scene is meaningless which tells me the editing is also top class. It makes me want to ask Billy to direct more movies. He has the gift of being honest, real and dispassionate, which I believe is the top most quality of a true director. Script: This is where the great attempt fails and why 'Sling Blade' will not be among the very best of all time. The script is clearly confused between it's innocently presumed hidden yet bare attempt to reveal a complex moral view and the belief and resolution of a single man, in the tussle, the movie is defeated and it completes no meaning which is beautiful in it's own way though it would have otherwise been masterly. Please watch this one urgently!

    Concerned with some of the dark pits of the human soul, Sling Blade is an interesting and emotionally captivating movie to watch. It is a demonstration of how ill behaviour can cause violence to surge up in human relationships... At the same time, Sling Blade points out some socially sensitive truths about the rights of the mentally disabled, as well as the immaturity that (still) exists in our society, regarding how society views them. The viewer cannot help but feel attached to Karl, the mentally disabled protagonist of the story, within the first couple of minutes. Indeed, the acting is great, especially considering that the roles played are not typical ones. There are, however, some flaws in the plot... for example, I cannot believe that Doyle just sat there, pathetically reading his newspaper, waiting to get hit in the head by a lawnmower blade... Even for someone who disrespects and looks down his nose to "retards", I believe that he should have felt at least a bit threatened (this also contradicts his anxiety because of Karl's earlier nightly walk with a hammer). In addition, I just cannot accept that the boy, Frank, took orders from Doyle without resenting and only limited himself to throwing some angry looks. It just doesn't make sense... Also, I don't think that mentally ill people who have been treated and then released back into society would just live without any supervision... I can forgive, at least to some extent, the aforementioned mistakes, since the acting was so great and really convincing... Nevertheless, I don't think Sling Blade is going to stay with me for a long time... It was moving, emotionally intense, and thought-provoking, but it lacked impressiveness. All in all, I would encourage you to watch the movie if you enjoy the genre.

    I lot of people seem to be down on Thorton for his role in this, but I cannot at all understand that. The point is - the acting, Karl is a 100% believable character. Sure, some may find his voice or mannerisms annoying, personally I did not at all, I found it to add to his character perfectly. The acting in this movie is quite excellent, most other movies don't come close at all, so many of these characters just 'jump out' at you and are totally believable. The beauty of this is that we all know a 'Linda' or a 'Doyle', and maybe a 'Vaughn' - but Karl? Few of us know someone with such a heart, but dealt such a bad hand in life. It fits perfectly with the plight of humanity; some people are gifted with piles of talent and intelligence, but waste it on violence and cheap thrills. Others have next to none, but make the very best of it that they can. Excellent film, either way - give it a chance if you like an excellent drama.

    "Sling Blade" is one of these genuine masterpieces that immediately take you off-guard. As soon as Karl Childers, the central character played by Billy Bob Thornton, starts talking, we know we're unto something new, original and unique. We meet Karl on the day he leaves a mental hospital; he doesn't talk first, forcing himself to listen to one of the inmate's disgusting anecdotes while he stares at the widow. His turn to speak comes when he describes to a young interviewer how he killed his mother and her lover with a Kaiser blade ("some call it a sling blade"). He was a child then and spent a long period trying to socially readjusting himself, mostly through reading Bible, not that he understands a great deal of it, but enough to reckon that people shouldn't kill each other. He talks in the dark, uninterrupted, striking by his raspy voice, colossal jaw and strange rubbing-hands habit highlighting a social unease. His words are punctuated by a weird sound, a "Mm-hmm" growl. Karl easily reminds of Forrest Gump, another mentally challenged character with specific mimics and mannerisms, but he never feels like an imitation, he IS an original and quite memorable creation. And after ten minutes, positive expectations started to invade my thoughts, a movie opening with such an original character and gripping monologue could only lead to cinematic greatness and nothing in the film ever belied my expectations. Thornton didn't just tell a story, he delivered a performance of hypnotic weirdness, enjoyable on a primary level. I loved watching the film again, just to see Karl ordering French fries in a burger restaurant: "I reckon I likes me some French fried potaters, mm-hmm". Some people would call it a 'guilty pleasure', it is but it never distracts from the core of the film, which starts with the rediscovery of freedom by a man of limited intelligence and ends with a poignant sacrifice. In between, "Sling Blade" takes us in a small word of bleak simplicity, nothing much happens, people mind their own business, work to pay the bills, and even a man like Karl can find his place if he has, for instance, a certain ability to fix lawnmowers and whatnot. There's a very smoothly handled straightforwardness in Thornton's script, allowing each important character to touch us directly as if it was an old acquaintance. Karl befriends a little boy named Frank and their fondness is as mutual as immediate. It's the kind of genuine friendships that don't need long set-ups, Frank simply 'loves the way Karl talks', and which child wouldn't? He asks his mother if Karl can live in the garage, she accepts. It feels realistic precisely because Linda is the kind of woman who sees good in everyone, and proves it through her boyfriend, an abusive loser played by Dwight Yoakam, and as others mentioned, the second best performance in the film, Oscar-worthy in every level. Doyle is the kind of wannabe rock-star who never got his break and vents his angry frustration on Frank by pretending to be a fatherly figure on the authority department. Otherwise, he spends most of his time lounging on the sofa, drinking beer, bullying Frank and challenging Linda's patience... he doesn't fool anyone. And within this world, Karl acts as a quiet observant. His passiveness mirrors the attitude of the fifth important character in the film, Linda's friend Vaughan, a homosexual forced to live in the town for easily guessable reasons. As a potential victim of intolerance, Vaughan is able to read through Karl's deadpan expression the hints of some inconsolable wounds, and no matter how tough they were, they certainly built an inner goodness in his heart. But Vaughan isn't a "guy" guy and can't fight a man like Doyle, but Karl can help him to take care of Linda and Frank, both would be like guardian angels. John Ritter delivers a magnificent performance in all nuance and subtlety as a man with great humanistic intuition. And indeed, the storyline concurs with Vaughan and we get more insights about Karl's tormented childhood. Karl is a man of good heart who learned to find the good in anyone because he could see the evil in some, including himself. The ensemble cast is so perfect that it's a wonder that the film didn't get more recognition. Yet the pillar of "Sling Blade" is Billy Bob Thornton. He doesn't perform acting, he's literally inhabited by the painful soul of Karl Childers, and he's so absorbing that we're always in the same wavelength. In one of the film's most significant moments, there is a violent argument between Doyle, Linda and Frank while Karl, almost comically, sits there and doesn't move. But look closely at his eyes, his mimics, his reactions when each object thrown by Frank hits Doyle or the wall. Karl is obviously disturbed as if he was witnessing the reminiscence of painful memories. And somewhat he looks determined to accomplish an act of existential gravity, something foreshadowed by the powerful moment when he grabs Doyle's arm and warns him to never lay a finger on little Frank. This very moment starts the countdown of Karl's freedom days. Although predictable, the conclusion doesn't diminish the film's emotional impact. Karl's actions are less eloquent than the last exchanges he had with each protagonist (including Doyle). They all say "Karl!" and keep silent while he leaves as if they resigned to a deadly omen. The film ends as it started, as if nothing changed. Karl sits in the same place, with the same expression; but this time, he refuses to listen to the pervert inmate and tells him straight in the eyes. Although he played a one-note character, Karl did change and for best. Once in his life, he did well by preventing a little child to endure the same hellish childhood. And I can't see but satisfaction in his eyes in the final, haunting shot.

    When I first watched "Sling Blade" about five years ago, I knew nothing about it and thought it was part of the Wesley Snipes vampire suckfest. I was completely unprepared for what has become my #1 favourite movie of all-time. Simply put, "Sling Blade" is the story of mentally-retarded Karl who gets released from "the nervous hospital" after 30 years, having committed a double murder as a young boy. He is taken in by an extremely trusting woman Linda and her young son Frank, who Karl befriends. This all takes place in what is surely one of the hillbilliest reddest-neck towns in Arkansas. To describe the story as big-hearted doesn't suffice, this story is ALL heart. In addition to the warm engaging characters of Karl, Linda and Frank, there's Linda's friend Vaughn, a closeted smalltown gay guy, and even the minor characters like doctors and mechanics are drawn as compassionate caring characters. This movie can remind you of all the good things human beings are capable of, even in dark circumstances. It's far from easy-viewing. Linda's abusive boyfriend Doyle is violent, manipulative, and threatens to destroy Linda and Frank. There are moments that are hard to watch (nothing graphic) and yet you can't turn your eyes away.

I mean, I love Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, but seriously Academy take that thing back and give it to Thornton. Billy Bob Thornton. Genius. Unbelievable. In the first minutes I could not believe that the man playing Karl is Thornton. His voice alone puts you in a situation, that you want absolute silence, when you're watching the movie. His character makes you smile and cry at the same time... I needed 17 years to discover this movie. I do apologize. Mr.Thornton where are you hiding? No, seriously. Please take out everything you ever had in your mind for an movie and start shooting. Right away. I will see all of them.

    There's no question that without "Sling Blade" Billy Bob Thornton would not have the respect he has today as an artist, even though he's not particularly celebrated for his other films as a director, nor is he particularly admired for his musical career as a country singer/songwriter. Although no one can deny he has had a respectable and prolific acting career, "Sling Blade" definitely stands out as the most beautiful and heartfelt of all of his films. Karl is a middle aged, mentally challenged man who gets released from the mental institution he had been in since he was 12, for having killed his mother and her lover. Out in the real world for the first time in a long time, he soon meets a young kid, Frank, who together with his mother offers Karl a place in their home. However, living with them is Doyle, the mother's evil, alcoholic boyfriend, who is hostile and acts as a mean bully towards the entire family. Although at first it seems that Thornton is doing some overacting as the main protagonist, in the end he clearly is the man stealing the show every time, and creates an utterly memorable character the audience can fall in love with immediately. The power of the film lies in how straightforward and universal it is, even though it takes place in a very unique and specific area, the deep South of the United States. Its themes are about being dear to someone and loving them, and as consequence being able to sacrifice oneself for them. Karl's figure here, although a man with not much mystery (his dark past is immediately revealed, so there's not much else to discover) is almost a divine presence; in the scenes of domestic violence, he silently sits on the edge of the frame, passively witnessing the secretive horrors of abuse. The fact that he gets baptizes by his own will might even imply a Jesus-like figure. Then again, this is not a movie with hidden meanings and obscure symbolism: it's a somewhat Gothic, modern tale told with just as much darkness as tenderness.

    This is one BADASS film! I saw it for the first time 5 or 6 weeks ago. I was AMAZED; by the story, Billy Bob Badass's performance (he was acting, wasn't he?), the directing, the score & the performances of the entire cast, AND the fact that I hadn't seen nor heard of this movie until now. A friend (a long way)from South Carolina played this and two other flicks (Lawless & American History X) for me recently. I was blown away. But Sling Blade was, by far, the best! I have seen hundreds of movies and thousands of acting performances. This is some powerful stuff! This is among the very best. And Thornton.....well, Burton, Anthony Hopkins, Denzel, Jack, Pacino, Sir Lawrence, Sidney, Penn, Kilmer and all of the rest ain't got nothing on him. I don't say that lightly, but I say it all the same.

    Rarely does a film reach the level of perfection achieved by the great films ever made. The Godfather. Slumdog Millionaire. The Fugitive. The Shawshank Redemption. Field Of Dreams. Just to name a few. Sling Blade is one such film. In a career-best, mind-boggling effort, Billy Bob Thornton shines as the star, writer, and director of this amazing film. He plays a curious character named Karl Childers, who's just been released from a mental hospital in the deep south. Karl did something very, very bad many, many years ago, but decades of being institutionalized has weathered him some. He's been set up with a part-time job and a place to stay. At first, we're wondering if Karl can handle all of this. But when he excels at his job and befriends a young boy, Thornton begins a process in which he expounds upon the character of Karl Childers so skillfully, so tenderly, when we know it's Thornton at the helm of the whole thing, you have to be in awe. We grow, rather quickly, to like Karl, and that's the idea. He strikes a chord within us, somewhere deep and primal. And make no mistake, this is anything but an exploitation of the mentally disturbed or anyone else. No, it's a stirring, heartfelt, and heartbreaking portrayal of a man who seemed doomed to redeem himself. The film also benefits from spot-on supporting performances by the likes of Lucas Black, the boy whom Karl befriends, Natalie Canerday as the boy's mother, Dwight Yoakam as her heavy drinking, dim-witted boyfriend, and John Ritter as the mother's best friend. These performances are top-notch all the way around. But what makes it a "perfect" movie is the way Thornton allowed himself as writer, director, and star to explore the character. Karl is simple, but multi-layered. Thornton creates a growth within the character that is as sensible as it is spellbinding. It's a two-hour peak into a world few would imagine if they hadn't seen it, with southern lower-middle class people in a dusty town set against a backdrop of often gorgeous, lush bayou-type settings. It creates a feel, emotionally. One scene in particular, where Karl goes home for the first time in decades, only to find his babbling, accusatory father rotting away in his rocking chair (a brilliant cameo performance by Robert Duvall), is performed with such a brilliant display of poignancy that we're left to wonder what the hell happened to Thornton in the years since this film. While I loved him in The Man Who Wasn't There, I hated him in Armageddon, and Bad Santa, and Mr. Woodcock, and just about everything else I've seen him in since. Those movies may have their moments, in the right time or place, but Sling Blade is timeless, and light years ahead of the vast majority of his other films. In fact, we're not even sure what year it takes place, and it doesn't matter. The mother's boyfriend, who doesn't like Karl or the Ritter character because he's gay, becomes increasingly confrontational and controlling. We feel fearful of what might happen. The bittersweet ending pulls no punches and plays no tricks; we practically expect it, but can't help being engrossed by it. Sling Blade is remarkable film everyone above the age of say, 16, should see. It's touching and powerful, and it's movie magic.

    Sling Blade gets very close to deliver what is promises, "unmistakable drama". Billy Bob's dream project, it shows how passionately and thoughtfully he has pursued it and created a very impressive piece of work. Billy Bob has written, directed and acted the protagonist in the movie of which the latter two are clear winners. Acting: Billy Bob is an amazing actor and it is expected of him to deliver good performance but in 'Karl' he has created an inconceivably beautiful character, I don't like to compare but if it helps you scale, he has become 'Karl' as much as Robert De Niro had become 'Leonard Lowe' in 'Awakenings' and Dustin Hoffman had become 'Raymond Babbitt' in 'Rain Man'. He has created a modern classic protagonist in 'Karl' 10/10 Others have done an above average job which is a shame given that Billy Bob was creating a masterpiece, it would have been great to have others deliver their best too. This makes the whole story slightly weaker and less convincing. Direction: This film doesn't prick you with cheap tricks, it brims ever so nicely with slow intensity, scene after scene, unfolding small events, revealing characters. It creates a piece of life which is real. At no point, this movie imitates it's inspiration, not a single scene is meaningless which tells me the editing is also top class. It makes me want to ask Billy to direct more movies. He has the gift of being honest, real and dispassionate, which I believe is the top most quality of a true director. Script: This is where the great attempt fails and why 'Sling Blade' will not be among the very best of all time. The script is clearly confused between it's innocently presumed hidden yet bare attempt to reveal a complex moral view and the belief and resolution of a single man, in the tussle, the movie is defeated and it completes no meaning which is beautiful in it's own way though it would have otherwise been masterly. Please watch this one urgently!

    Concerned with some of the dark pits of the human soul, Sling Blade is an interesting and emotionally captivating movie to watch. It is a demonstration of how ill behaviour can cause violence to surge up in human relationships... At the same time, Sling Blade points out some socially sensitive truths about the rights of the mentally disabled, as well as the immaturity that (still) exists in our society, regarding how society views them. The viewer cannot help but feel attached to Karl, the mentally disabled protagonist of the story, within the first couple of minutes. Indeed, the acting is great, especially considering that the roles played are not typical ones. There are, however, some flaws in the plot... for example, I cannot believe that Doyle just sat there, pathetically reading his newspaper, waiting to get hit in the head by a lawnmower blade... Even for someone who disrespects and looks down his nose to "retards", I believe that he should have felt at least a bit threatened (this also contradicts his anxiety because of Karl's earlier nightly walk with a hammer). In addition, I just cannot accept that the boy, Frank, took orders from Doyle without resenting and only limited himself to throwing some angry looks. It just doesn't make sense... Also, I don't think that mentally ill people who have been treated and then released back into society would just live without any supervision... I can forgive, at least to some extent, the aforementioned mistakes, since the acting was so great and really convincing... Nevertheless, I don't think Sling Blade is going to stay with me for a long time... It was moving, emotionally intense, and thought-provoking, but it lacked impressiveness. All in all, I would encourage you to watch the movie if you enjoy the genre.

    I lot of people seem to be down on Thorton for his role in this, but I cannot at all understand that. The point is - the acting, Karl is a 100% believable character. Sure, some may find his voice or mannerisms annoying, personally I did not at all, I found it to add to his character perfectly. The acting in this movie is quite excellent, most other movies don't come close at all, so many of these characters just 'jump out' at you and are totally believable. The beauty of this is that we all know a 'Linda' or a 'Doyle', and maybe a 'Vaughn' - but Karl? Few of us know someone with such a heart, but dealt such a bad hand in life. It fits perfectly with the plight of humanity; some people are gifted with piles of talent and intelligence, but waste it on violence and cheap thrills. Others have next to none, but make the very best of it that they can. Excellent film, either way - give it a chance if you like an excellent drama.

    "Sling Blade" is one of these genuine masterpieces that immediately take you off-guard. As soon as Karl Childers, the central character played by Billy Bob Thornton, starts talking, we know we're unto something new, original and unique. We meet Karl on the day he leaves a mental hospital; he doesn't talk first, forcing himself to listen to one of the inmate's disgusting anecdotes while he stares at the widow. His turn to speak comes when he describes to a young interviewer how he killed his mother and her lover with a Kaiser blade ("some call it a sling blade"). He was a child then and spent a long period trying to socially readjusting himself, mostly through reading Bible, not that he understands a great deal of it, but enough to reckon that people shouldn't kill each other. He talks in the dark, uninterrupted, striking by his raspy voice, colossal jaw and strange rubbing-hands habit highlighting a social unease. His words are punctuated by a weird sound, a "Mm-hmm" growl. Karl easily reminds of Forrest Gump, another mentally challenged character with specific mimics and mannerisms, but he never feels like an imitation, he IS an original and quite memorable creation. And after ten minutes, positive expectations started to invade my thoughts, a movie opening with such an original character and gripping monologue could only lead to cinematic greatness and nothing in the film ever belied my expectations. Thornton didn't just tell a story, he delivered a performance of hypnotic weirdness, enjoyable on a primary level. I loved watching the film again, just to see Karl ordering French fries in a burger restaurant: "I reckon I likes me some French fried potaters, mm-hmm". Some people would call it a 'guilty pleasure', it is but it never distracts from the core of the film, which starts with the rediscovery of freedom by a man of limited intelligence and ends with a poignant sacrifice. In between, "Sling Blade" takes us in a small word of bleak simplicity, nothing much happens, people mind their own business, work to pay the bills, and even a man like Karl can find his place if he has, for instance, a certain ability to fix lawnmowers and whatnot. There's a very smoothly handled straightforwardness in Thornton's script, allowing each important character to touch us directly as if it was an old acquaintance. Karl befriends a little boy named Frank and their fondness is as mutual as immediate. It's the kind of genuine friendships that don't need long set-ups, Frank simply 'loves the way Karl talks', and which child wouldn't? He asks his mother if Karl can live in the garage, she accepts. It feels realistic precisely because Linda is the kind of woman who sees good in everyone, and proves it through her boyfriend, an abusive loser played by Dwight Yoakam, and as others mentioned, the second best performance in the film, Oscar-worthy in every level. Doyle is the kind of wannabe rock-star who never got his break and vents his angry frustration on Frank by pretending to be a fatherly figure on the authority department. Otherwise, he spends most of his time lounging on the sofa, drinking beer, bullying Frank and challenging Linda's patience... he doesn't fool anyone. And within this world, Karl acts as a quiet observant. His passiveness mirrors the attitude of the fifth important character in the film, Linda's friend Vaughan, a homosexual forced to live in the town for easily guessable reasons. As a potential victim of intolerance, Vaughan is able to read through Karl's deadpan expression the hints of some inconsolable wounds, and no matter how tough they were, they certainly built an inner goodness in his heart. But Vaughan isn't a "guy" guy and can't fight a man like Doyle, but Karl can help him to take care of Linda and Frank, both would be like guardian angels. John Ritter delivers a magnificent performance in all nuance and subtlety as a man with great humanistic intuition. And indeed, the storyline concurs with Vaughan and we get more insights about Karl's tormented childhood. Karl is a man of good heart who learned to find the good in anyone because he could see the evil in some, including himself. The ensemble cast is so perfect that it's a wonder that the film didn't get more recognition. Yet the pillar of "Sling Blade" is Billy Bob Thornton. He doesn't perform acting, he's literally inhabited by the painful soul of Karl Childers, and he's so absorbing that we're always in the same wavelength. In one of the film's most significant moments, there is a violent argument between Doyle, Linda and Frank while Karl, almost comically, sits there and doesn't move. But look closely at his eyes, his mimics, his reactions when each object thrown by Frank hits Doyle or the wall. Karl is obviously disturbed as if he was witnessing the reminiscence of painful memories. And somewhat he looks determined to accomplish an act of existential gravity, something foreshadowed by the powerful moment when he grabs Doyle's arm and warns him to never lay a finger on little Frank. This very moment starts the countdown of Karl's freedom days. Although predictable, the conclusion doesn't diminish the film's emotional impact. Karl's actions are less eloquent than the last exchanges he had with each protagonist (including Doyle). They all say "Karl!" and keep silent while he leaves as if they resigned to a deadly omen. The film ends as it started, as if nothing changed. Karl sits in the same place, with the same expression; but this time, he refuses to listen to the pervert inmate and tells him straight in the eyes. Although he played a one-note character, Karl did change and for best. Once in his life, he did well by preventing a little child to endure the same hellish childhood. And I can't see but satisfaction in his eyes in the final, haunting shot.

    When I first watched "Sling Blade" about five years ago, I knew nothing about it and thought it was part of the Wesley Snipes vampire suckfest. I was completely unprepared for what has become my #1 favourite movie of all-time. Simply put, "Sling Blade" is the story of mentally-retarded Karl who gets released from "the nervous hospital" after 30 years, having committed a double murder as a young boy. He is taken in by an extremely trusting woman Linda and her young son Frank, who Karl befriends. This all takes place in what is surely one of the hillbilliest reddest-neck towns in Arkansas. To describe the story as big-hearted doesn't suffice, this story is ALL heart. In addition to the warm engaging characters of Karl, Linda and Frank, there's Linda's friend Vaughn, a closeted smalltown gay guy, and even the minor characters like doctors and mechanics are drawn as compassionate caring characters. This movie can remind you of all the good things human beings are capable of, even in dark circumstances. It's far from easy-viewing. Linda's abusive boyfriend Doyle is violent, manipulative, and threatens to destroy Linda and Frank. There are moments that are hard to watch (nothing graphic) and yet you can't turn your eyes away.

    Whenever there's a poll for the "Best Movie Ever Made", _Sling Blade_ should be a contender. It's a winner throughout its long runtime of 2.5 hours; it never bores, not even in the "Director's Cut" version in which previously cut 20 or so minutes are restored. It's a vehicle for the director, writer and main star of _Sling Blade_, Billy Bob Thornton -- and clearly he invested his life's most intense creative effort into this movie (expanded from an earlier short movie of 25 minutes), and all the effort paid off hugely. The acting is uniformly superb, starting with the ingenious creation of the leading character of Karl Childers; the distinctive speech, behaviour, and movement patters of this character are something that's likely to make you smile ever so often even after you get perfectly used to seeing them. It's like the boy says to Karl, "I like the way you talk," and Karl replies: "I like the way *you* talk." Indeed, this reverse is true as well; never has dialectal speech been captured on film more charmingly than Thornton's native Arkansas dialect in _Sling Blade_, so true to life it may sometimes be difficult, even for native English speakers, to understand what is being said, but you won't mind. Hardly anyone can pull off the trick of showing a grown man embracing a boy and saying, "I love you," with the boy replying, "I love you too," without this involving sexual connotations; but Thornton accomplishes the feat here; the relationship and friendship is portrayed as purely Platonic, that is non-sexual (as opposed to the original Greek concept). A huge accomplishment of _Sling Blade_ is on how many levels it is engaging: it's an engrossing, serious, and essentially brutal drama, but in many moments, it's also wonderful comedy; the dramatic and the comedic are often intertwined within the same scene. There's a delightful cameo by another genius film-maker, Jim Jarmusch, as the seller of "French fried potatoes", at the beginning of the movie; there's definitely a spiritual connection, if you will, between _Sling Blade_ and Jarmusch's work; _Sling Blade_ might well be a Jarmusch movie for all you know, and anyone who loves Jim Jarmusch movies will feel right at home in _Sling Blade_. (Speaking of cameos, let's also give credit to Robert Duvall for the few minutes he can be seen here!) Another astonishing achievement of _Sling Blade_ is that even though you have a pretty good idea about how the movie is going to end -- you don't really mind; it's suspenseful throughout. Watching the movie is likely to make you feel desperate, maddeningly helpless; or you might even become a misanthrope; because you realize that it is only through pure accident or lucky (?) chance that Karl was able to rescue (by questionable means) the mother & boy from the abusive live-in boyfriend (fabulously played by Dwight Yoakam: larger than life here, and more menacing than the repeat killer!). But how many abused families, wives, mothers, or children, are there around the world right now, and have been for centuries, and will be for many more centuries to come, yet with no Karl to come to *their* rescue? After you realize this, it really makes you despair of the human race. Especially after you realize that the suffering is at least partly self-inflicted: the mother brought the abuser's affections onto herself willingly, feeling unable to cope with her life situation on her own after her husband commits suicide due to lacking finances to support his family. That is another stinging aspect of _Sling Blade_: portraying the ridiculous materialistic divides between people, even those in their early teens; see the scene where the girl disdainfully speaks of the bouquet of flowers lovingly presented to her as coming "from a dollar store" and therefore being of inferior quality. Other cast members are great, too, particularly Lucas Black in the boy's role, and John Ritter as the overly sensitive -- or is it cowardly? -- but movingly humane dollar-store owner. Fantastic score by David Lanois, especially in the disjointed rock guitar riffs just prior to the murder scene; it's as if the music was mirroring the lead character's unclear state of mind, his decision-making process. It's fascinating that although we observe Karl Childers for 2.5 hours, he's not really a clear-cut, easily labelled person; we struggle, in classifying him, similarly to Vaughan when, in a funny episode, he believes Karl must have been thinking hard, philosophically, about something, although he was only thinking about food right then. And so, even though Karl is clearly mentally handicapped, in other ways he's a genius, representing a character surrounded by a world intrinsically foreign to him ("it's too big," he says at the end); the world at large is different from Karl -- and so anyone who feels estranged in their life situation, can sympathize with Karl; their fate is like that of Karl. And doesn't this apply to all geniuses, or in a sense: to all artists? This was incisively captured by Vaughan when he remarked that "being gay in this small town is like being handicapped"; but the same might be said of people whose intelligence much exceeds that of their surroundings: they will feel similarly estranged. Yet the world in _Sling Blade_ isn't depicted as black-and-white; funnily enough, the only colour eschewed is red (because Thornton dislikes it); otherwise, _Sling Blade_ shows the world and human beings as they are, in their complex entirety and self-contradicting facets: both beautiful (gorgeous backdrops of rural Arkansas!) and at the same time hideous; both cruel and stupid, and simultaneously compassionate and kind (see the warden and his family, or the Bill Cox character who cannot reconcile his "Christian conscience" with keeping Karl locked away for the night, handing him the keys on day 2).

The film also benefits from spot-on supporting performances by the likes of Lucas Black, the boy whom Karl befriends, Natalie Canerday as the boy's mother, Dwight Yoakam as her heavy drinking, dim-witted boyfriend, and John Ritter as the mother's best friend. These performances are top-notch all the way around. But what makes it a "perfect" movie is the way Thornton allowed himself as writer, director, and star to explore the character. Karl is simple, but multi-layered. Thornton creates a growth within the character that is as sensible as it is spellbinding. It's a two-hour peak into a world few would imagine if they hadn't seen it, with southern lower-middle class people in a dusty town set against a backdrop of often gorgeous, lush bayou-type settings. It creates a feel, emotionally. One scene in particular, where Karl goes home for the first time in decades, only to find his babbling, accusatory father rotting away in his rocking chair (a brilliant cameo performance by Robert Duvall), is performed with such a brilliant display of poignancy that we're left to wonder what the hell happened to Thornton in the years since this film. While I loved him in The Man Who Wasn't There, I hated him in Armageddon, and Bad Santa, and Mr. Woodcock, and just about everything else I've seen him in since. Those movies may have their moments, in the right time or place, but Sling Blade is timeless, and light years ahead of the vast majority of his other films. In fact, we're not even sure what year it takes place, and it doesn't matter. The mother's boyfriend, who doesn't like Karl or the Ritter character because he's gay, becomes increasingly confrontational and controlling. We feel fearful of what might happen. The bittersweet ending pulls no punches and plays no tricks; we practically expect it, but can't help being engrossed by it. Sling Blade is remarkable film everyone above the age of say, 16, should see. It's touching and powerful, and it's movie magic.

    Sling Blade gets very close to deliver what is promises, "unmistakable drama". Billy Bob's dream project, it shows how passionately and thoughtfully he has pursued it and created a very impressive piece of work. Billy Bob has written, directed and acted the protagonist in the movie of which the latter two are clear winners. Acting: Billy Bob is an amazing actor and it is expected of him to deliver good performance but in 'Karl' he has created an inconceivably beautiful character, I don't like to compare but if it helps you scale, he has become 'Karl' as much as Robert De Niro had become 'Leonard Lowe' in 'Awakenings' and Dustin Hoffman had become 'Raymond Babbitt' in 'Rain Man'. He has created a modern classic protagonist in 'Karl' 10/10 Others have done an above average job which is a shame given that Billy Bob was creating a masterpiece, it would have been great to have others deliver their best too. This makes the whole story slightly weaker and less convincing. Direction: This film doesn't prick you with cheap tricks, it brims ever so nicely with slow intensity, scene after scene, unfolding small events, revealing characters. It creates a piece of life which is real. At no point, this movie imitates it's inspiration, not a single scene is meaningless which tells me the editing is also top class. It makes me want to ask Billy to direct more movies. He has the gift of being honest, real and dispassionate, which I believe is the top most quality of a true director. Script: This is where the great attempt fails and why 'Sling Blade' will not be among the very best of all time. The script is clearly confused between it's innocently presumed hidden yet bare attempt to reveal a complex moral view and the belief and resolution of a single man, in the tussle, the movie is defeated and it completes no meaning which is beautiful in it's own way though it would have otherwise been masterly. Please watch this one urgently!

    Concerned with some of the dark pits of the human soul, Sling Blade is an interesting and emotionally captivating movie to watch. It is a demonstration of how ill behaviour can cause violence to surge up in human relationships... At the same time, Sling Blade points out some socially sensitive truths about the rights of the mentally disabled, as well as the immaturity that (still) exists in our society, regarding how society views them. The viewer cannot help but feel attached to Karl, the mentally disabled protagonist of the story, within the first couple of minutes. Indeed, the acting is great, especially considering that the roles played are not typical ones. There are, however, some flaws in the plot... for example, I cannot believe that Doyle just sat there, pathetically reading his newspaper, waiting to get hit in the head by a lawnmower blade... Even for someone who disrespects and looks down his nose to "retards", I believe that he should have felt at least a bit threatened (this also contradicts his anxiety because of Karl's earlier nightly walk with a hammer). In addition, I just cannot accept that the boy, Frank, took orders from Doyle without resenting and only limited himself to throwing some angry looks. It just doesn't make sense... Also, I don't think that mentally ill people who have been treated and then released back into society would just live without any supervision... I can forgive, at least to some extent, the aforementioned mistakes, since the acting was so great and really convincing... Nevertheless, I don't think Sling Blade is going to stay with me for a long time... It was moving, emotionally intense, and thought-provoking, but it lacked impressiveness. All in all, I would encourage you to watch the movie if you enjoy the genre.

    I lot of people seem to be down on Thorton for his role in this, but I cannot at all understand that. The point is - the acting, Karl is a 100% believable character. Sure, some may find his voice or mannerisms annoying, personally I did not at all, I found it to add to his character perfectly. The acting in this movie is quite excellent, most other movies don't come close at all, so many of these characters just 'jump out' at you and are totally believable. The beauty of this is that we all know a 'Linda' or a 'Doyle', and maybe a 'Vaughn' - but Karl? Few of us know someone with such a heart, but dealt such a bad hand in life. It fits perfectly with the plight of humanity; some people are gifted with piles of talent and intelligence, but waste it on violence and cheap thrills. Others have next to none, but make the very best of it that they can. Excellent film, either way - give it a chance if you like an excellent drama.

    "Sling Blade" is one of these genuine masterpieces that immediately take you off-guard. As soon as Karl Childers, the central character played by Billy Bob Thornton, starts talking, we know we're unto something new, original and unique. We meet Karl on the day he leaves a mental hospital; he doesn't talk first, forcing himself to listen to one of the inmate's disgusting anecdotes while he stares at the widow. His turn to speak comes when he describes to a young interviewer how he killed his mother and her lover with a Kaiser blade ("some call it a sling blade"). He was a child then and spent a long period trying to socially readjusting himself, mostly through reading Bible, not that he understands a great deal of it, but enough to reckon that people shouldn't kill each other. He talks in the dark, uninterrupted, striking by his raspy voice, colossal jaw and strange rubbing-hands habit highlighting a social unease. His words are punctuated by a weird sound, a "Mm-hmm" growl. Karl easily reminds of Forrest Gump, another mentally challenged character with specific mimics and mannerisms, but he never feels like an imitation, he IS an original and quite memorable creation. And after ten minutes, positive expectations started to invade my thoughts, a movie opening with such an original character and gripping monologue could only lead to cinematic greatness and nothing in the film ever belied my expectations. Thornton didn't just tell a story, he delivered a performance of hypnotic weirdness, enjoyable on a primary level. I loved watching the film again, just to see Karl ordering French fries in a burger restaurant: "I reckon I likes me some French fried potaters, mm-hmm". Some people would call it a 'guilty pleasure', it is but it never distracts from the core of the film, which starts with the rediscovery of freedom by a man of limited intelligence and ends with a poignant sacrifice. In between, "Sling Blade" takes us in a small word of bleak simplicity, nothing much happens, people mind their own business, work to pay the bills, and even a man like Karl can find his place if he has, for instance, a certain ability to fix lawnmowers and whatnot. There's a very smoothly handled straightforwardness in Thornton's script, allowing each important character to touch us directly as if it was an old acquaintance. Karl befriends a little boy named Frank and their fondness is as mutual as immediate. It's the kind of genuine friendships that don't need long set-ups, Frank simply 'loves the way Karl talks', and which child wouldn't? He asks his mother if Karl can live in the garage, she accepts. It feels realistic precisely because Linda is the kind of woman who sees good in everyone, and proves it through her boyfriend, an abusive loser played by Dwight Yoakam, and as others mentioned, the second best performance in the film, Oscar-worthy in every level. Doyle is the kind of wannabe rock-star who never got his break and vents his angry frustration on Frank by pretending to be a fatherly figure on the authority department. Otherwise, he spends most of his time lounging on the sofa, drinking beer, bullying Frank and challenging Linda's patience... he doesn't fool anyone. And within this world, Karl acts as a quiet observant. His passiveness mirrors the attitude of the fifth important character in the film, Linda's friend Vaughan, a homosexual forced to live in the town for easily guessable reasons. As a potential victim of intolerance, Vaughan is able to read through Karl's deadpan expression the hints of some inconsolable wounds, and no matter how tough they were, they certainly built an inner goodness in his heart. But Vaughan isn't a "guy" guy and can't fight a man like Doyle, but Karl can help him to take care of Linda and Frank, both would be like guardian angels. John Ritter delivers a magnificent performance in all nuance and subtlety as a man with great humanistic intuition. And indeed, the storyline concurs with Vaughan and we get more insights about Karl's tormented childhood. Karl is a man of good heart who learned to find the good in anyone because he could see the evil in some, including himself. The ensemble cast is so perfect that it's a wonder that the film didn't get more recognition. Yet the pillar of "Sling Blade" is Billy Bob Thornton. He doesn't perform acting, he's literally inhabited by the painful soul of Karl Childers, and he's so absorbing that we're always in the same wavelength. In one of the film's most significant moments, there is a violent argument between Doyle, Linda and Frank while Karl, almost comically, sits there and doesn't move. But look closely at his eyes, his mimics, his reactions when each object thrown by Frank hits Doyle or the wall. Karl is obviously disturbed as if he was witnessing the reminiscence of painful memories. And somewhat he looks determined to accomplish an act of existential gravity, something foreshadowed by the powerful moment when he grabs Doyle's arm and warns him to never lay a finger on little Frank. This very moment starts the countdown of Karl's freedom days. Although predictable, the conclusion doesn't diminish the film's emotional impact. Karl's actions are less eloquent than the last exchanges he had with each protagonist (including Doyle). They all say "Karl!" and keep silent while he leaves as if they resigned to a deadly omen. The film ends as it started, as if nothing changed. Karl sits in the same place, with the same expression; but this time, he refuses to listen to the pervert inmate and tells him straight in the eyes. Although he played a one-note character, Karl did change and for best. Once in his life, he did well by preventing a little child to endure the same hellish childhood. And I can't see but satisfaction in his eyes in the final, haunting shot.

    When I first watched "Sling Blade" about five years ago, I knew nothing about it and thought it was part of the Wesley Snipes vampire suckfest. I was completely unprepared for what has become my #1 favourite movie of all-time. Simply put, "Sling Blade" is the story of mentally-retarded Karl who gets released from "the nervous hospital" after 30 years, having committed a double murder as a young boy. He is taken in by an extremely trusting woman Linda and her young son Frank, who Karl befriends. This all takes place in what is surely one of the hillbilliest reddest-neck towns in Arkansas. To describe the story as big-hearted doesn't suffice, this story is ALL heart. In addition to the warm engaging characters of Karl, Linda and Frank, there's Linda's friend Vaughn, a closeted smalltown gay guy, and even the minor characters like doctors and mechanics are drawn as compassionate caring characters. This movie can remind you of all the good things human beings are capable of, even in dark circumstances. It's far from easy-viewing. Linda's abusive boyfriend Doyle is violent, manipulative, and threatens to destroy Linda and Frank. There are moments that are hard to watch (nothing graphic) and yet you can't turn your eyes away.

    Whenever there's a poll for the "Best Movie Ever Made", _Sling Blade_ should be a contender. It's a winner throughout its long runtime of 2.5 hours; it never bores, not even in the "Director's Cut" version in which previously cut 20 or so minutes are restored. It's a vehicle for the director, writer and main star of _Sling Blade_, Billy Bob Thornton -- and clearly he invested his life's most intense creative effort into this movie (expanded from an earlier short movie of 25 minutes), and all the effort paid off hugely. The acting is uniformly superb, starting with the ingenious creation of the leading character of Karl Childers; the distinctive speech, behaviour, and movement patters of this character are something that's likely to make you smile ever so often even after you get perfectly used to seeing them. It's like the boy says to Karl, "I like the way you talk," and Karl replies: "I like the way *you* talk." Indeed, this reverse is true as well; never has dialectal speech been captured on film more charmingly than Thornton's native Arkansas dialect in _Sling Blade_, so true to life it may sometimes be difficult, even for native English speakers, to understand what is being said, but you won't mind. Hardly anyone can pull off the trick of showing a grown man embracing a boy and saying, "I love you," with the boy replying, "I love you too," without this involving sexual connotations; but Thornton accomplishes the feat here; the relationship and friendship is portrayed as purely Platonic, that is non-sexual (as opposed to the original Greek concept). A huge accomplishment of _Sling Blade_ is on how many levels it is engaging: it's an engrossing, serious, and essentially brutal drama, but in many moments, it's also wonderful comedy; the dramatic and the comedic are often intertwined within the same scene. There's a delightful cameo by another genius film-maker, Jim Jarmusch, as the seller of "French fried potatoes", at the beginning of the movie; there's definitely a spiritual connection, if you will, between _Sling Blade_ and Jarmusch's work; _Sling Blade_ might well be a Jarmusch movie for all you know, and anyone who loves Jim Jarmusch movies will feel right at home in _Sling Blade_. (Speaking of cameos, let's also give credit to Robert Duvall for the few minutes he can be seen here!) Another astonishing achievement of _Sling Blade_ is that even though you have a pretty good idea about how the movie is going to end -- you don't really mind; it's suspenseful throughout. Watching the movie is likely to make you feel desperate, maddeningly helpless; or you might even become a misanthrope; because you realize that it is only through pure accident or lucky (?) chance that Karl was able to rescue (by questionable means) the mother & boy from the abusive live-in boyfriend (fabulously played by Dwight Yoakam: larger than life here, and more menacing than the repeat killer!). But how many abused families, wives, mothers, or children, are there around the world right now, and have been for centuries, and will be for many more centuries to come, yet with no Karl to come to *their* rescue? After you realize this, it really makes you despair of the human race. Especially after you realize that the suffering is at least partly self-inflicted: the mother brought the abuser's affections onto herself willingly, feeling unable to cope with her life situation on her own after her husband commits suicide due to lacking finances to support his family. That is another stinging aspect of _Sling Blade_: portraying the ridiculous materialistic divides between people, even those in their early teens; see the scene where the girl disdainfully speaks of the bouquet of flowers lovingly presented to her as coming "from a dollar store" and therefore being of inferior quality. Other cast members are great, too, particularly Lucas Black in the boy's role, and John Ritter as the overly sensitive -- or is it cowardly? -- but movingly humane dollar-store owner. Fantastic score by David Lanois, especially in the disjointed rock guitar riffs just prior to the murder scene; it's as if the music was mirroring the lead character's unclear state of mind, his decision-making process. It's fascinating that although we observe Karl Childers for 2.5 hours, he's not really a clear-cut, easily labelled person; we struggle, in classifying him, similarly to Vaughan when, in a funny episode, he believes Karl must have been thinking hard, philosophically, about something, although he was only thinking about food right then. And so, even though Karl is clearly mentally handicapped, in other ways he's a genius, representing a character surrounded by a world intrinsically foreign to him ("it's too big," he says at the end); the world at large is different from Karl -- and so anyone who feels estranged in their life situation, can sympathize with Karl; their fate is like that of Karl. And doesn't this apply to all geniuses, or in a sense: to all artists? This was incisively captured by Vaughan when he remarked that "being gay in this small town is like being handicapped"; but the same might be said of people whose intelligence much exceeds that of their surroundings: they will feel similarly estranged. Yet the world in _Sling Blade_ isn't depicted as black-and-white; funnily enough, the only colour eschewed is red (because Thornton dislikes it); otherwise, _Sling Blade_ shows the world and human beings as they are, in their complex entirety and self-contradicting facets: both beautiful (gorgeous backdrops of rural Arkansas!) and at the same time hideous; both cruel and stupid, and simultaneously compassionate and kind (see the warden and his family, or the Bill Cox character who cannot reconcile his "Christian conscience" with keeping Karl locked away for the night, handing him the keys on day 2).

    It was just pure luck I discovered this movie. But thanks to that greater power that I did so. I mean, I love Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, but seriously Academy take that thing back and give it to Thornton. Billy Bob Thornton. Genius. Unbelievable. In the first minutes I could not believe that the man playing Karl is Thornton. His voice alone puts you in a situation, that you want absolute silence, when you're watching the movie. His character makes you smile and cry at the same time... I needed 17 years to discover this movie. I do apologize. Mr.Thornton where are you hiding? No, seriously. Please take out everything you ever had in your mind for an movie and start shooting. Right away. I will see all of them.

    There's no question that without "Sling Blade" Billy Bob Thornton would not have the respect he has today as an artist, even though he's not particularly celebrated for his other films as a director, nor is he particularly admired for his musical career as a country singer/songwriter. Although no one can deny he has had a respectable and prolific acting career, "Sling Blade" definitely stands out as the most beautiful and heartfelt of all of his films. Karl is a middle aged, mentally challenged man who gets released from the mental institution he had been in since he was 12, for having killed his mother and her lover. Out in the real world for the first time in a long time, he soon meets a young kid, Frank, who together with his mother offers Karl a place in their home. However, living with them is Doyle, the mother's evil, alcoholic boyfriend, who is hostile and acts as a mean bully towards the entire family. Although at first it seems that Thornton is doing some overacting as the main protagonist, in the end he clearly is the man stealing the show every time, and creates an utterly memorable character the audience can fall in love with immediately. The power of the film lies in how straightforward and universal it is, even though it takes place in a very unique and specific area, the deep South of the United States. Its themes are about being dear to someone and loving them, and as consequence being able to sacrifice oneself for them. Karl's figure here, although a man with not much mystery (his dark past is immediately revealed, so there's not much else to discover) is almost a divine presence; in the scenes of domestic violence, he silently sits on the edge of the frame, passively witnessing the secretive horrors of abuse. The fact that he gets baptizes by his own will might even imply a Jesus-like figure. Then again, this is not a movie with hidden meanings and obscure symbolism: it's a somewhat Gothic, modern tale told with just as much darkness as tenderness.

    This is one BADASS film! I saw it for the first time 5 or 6 weeks ago. I was AMAZED; by the story, Billy Bob Badass's performance (he was acting, wasn't he?), the directing, the score & the performances of the entire cast, AND the fact that I hadn't seen nor heard of this movie until now. A friend (a long way)from South Carolina played this and two other flicks (Lawless & American History X) for me recently. I was blown away. But Sling Blade was, by far, the best! I have seen hundreds of movies and thousands of acting performances. This is some powerful stuff! This is among the very best. And Thornton.....well, Burton, Anthony Hopkins, Denzel, Jack, Pacino, Sir Lawrence, Sidney, Penn, Kilmer and all of the rest ain't got nothing on him. I don't say that lightly, but I say it all the same.

    Rarely does a film reach the level of perfection achieved by the great films ever made. The Godfather. Slumdog Millionaire. The Fugitive. The Shawshank Redemption. Field Of Dreams. Just to name a few. Sling Blade is one such film. In a career-best, mind-boggling effort, Billy Bob Thornton shines as the star, writer, and director of this amazing film. He plays a curious character named Karl Childers, who's just been released from a mental hospital in the deep south. Karl did something very, very bad many, many years ago, but decades of being institutionalized has weathered him some. He's been set up with a part-time job and a place to stay. At first, we're wondering if Karl can handle all of this. But when he excels at his job and befriends a young boy, Thornton begins a process in which he expounds upon the character of Karl Childers so skillfully, so tenderly, when we know it's Thornton at the helm of the whole thing, you have to be in awe. We grow, rather quickly, to like Karl, and that's the idea. He strikes a chord within us, somewhere deep and primal. And make no mistake, this is anything but an exploitation of the mentally disturbed or anyone else. No, it's a stirring, heartfelt, and heartbreaking portrayal of a man who seemed doomed to redeem himself. The film also benefits from spot-on supporting performances by the likes of Lucas Black, the boy whom Karl befriends, Natalie Canerday as the boy's mother, Dwight Yoakam as her heavy drinking, dim-witted boyfriend, and John Ritter as the mother's best friend. These performances are top-notch all the way around. But what makes it a "perfect" movie is the way Thornton allowed himself as writer, director, and star to explore the character. Karl is simple, but multi-layered. Thornton creates a growth within the character that is as sensible as it is spellbinding. It's a two-hour peak into a world few would imagine if they hadn't seen it, with southern lower-middle class people in a dusty town set against a backdrop of often gorgeous, lush bayou-type settings. It creates a feel, emotionally. One scene in particular, where Karl goes home for the first time in decades, only to find his babbling, accusatory father rotting away in his rocking chair (a brilliant cameo performance by Robert Duvall), is performed with such a brilliant display of poignancy that we're left to wonder what the hell happened to Thornton in the years since this film. While I loved him in The Man Who Wasn't There, I hated him in Armageddon, and Bad Santa, and Mr. Woodcock, and just about everything else I've seen him in since. Those movies may have their moments, in the right time or place, but Sling Blade is timeless, and light years ahead of the vast majority of his other films. In fact, we're not even sure what year it takes place, and it doesn't matter. The mother's boyfriend, who doesn't like Karl or the Ritter character because he's gay, becomes increasingly confrontational and controlling. We feel fearful of what might happen. The bittersweet ending pulls no punches and plays no tricks; we practically expect it, but can't help being engrossed by it. Sling Blade is remarkable film everyone above the age of say, 16, should see. It's touching and powerful, and it's movie magic.

The script is clearly confused between it's innocently presumed hidden yet bare attempt to reveal a complex moral view and the belief and resolution of a single man, in the tussle, the movie is defeated and it completes no meaning which is beautiful in it's own way though it would have otherwise been masterly.

Nevertheless, I don't think Sling Blade is going to stay with me for a long time... It was moving, emotionally intense, and thought-provoking, but it lacked impressiveness. All in all, I would encourage you to watch the movie if you enjoy the genre.

    I lot of people seem to be down on Thorton for his role in this, but I cannot at all understand that. The point is - the acting, Karl is a 100% believable character. Sure, some may find his voice or mannerisms annoying, personally I did not at all, I found it to add to his character perfectly. The acting in this movie is quite excellent, most other movies don't come close at all, so many of these characters just 'jump out' at you and are totally believable. The beauty of this is that we all know a 'Linda' or a 'Doyle', and maybe a 'Vaughn' - but Karl? Few of us know someone with such a heart, but dealt such a bad hand in life. It fits perfectly with the plight of humanity; some people are gifted with piles of talent and intelligence, but waste it on violence and cheap thrills. Others have next to none, but make the very best of it that they can. Excellent film, either way - give it a chance if you like an excellent drama.

    "Sling Blade" is one of these genuine masterpieces that immediately take you off-guard. As soon as Karl Childers, the central character played by Billy Bob Thornton, starts talking, we know we're unto something new, original and unique. We meet Karl on the day he leaves a mental hospital; he doesn't talk first, forcing himself to listen to one of the inmate's disgusting anecdotes while he stares at the widow. His turn to speak comes when he describes to a young interviewer how he killed his mother and her lover with a Kaiser blade ("some call it a sling blade"). He was a child then and spent a long period trying to socially readjusting himself, mostly through reading Bible, not that he understands a great deal of it, but enough to reckon that people shouldn't kill each other. He talks in the dark, uninterrupted, striking by his raspy voice, colossal jaw and strange rubbing-hands habit highlighting a social unease. His words are punctuated by a weird sound, a "Mm-hmm" growl. Karl easily reminds of Forrest Gump, another mentally challenged character with specific mimics and mannerisms, but he never feels like an imitation, he IS an original and quite memorable creation. And after ten minutes, positive expectations started to invade my thoughts, a movie opening with such an original character and gripping monologue could only lead to cinematic greatness and nothing in the film ever belied my expectations. Thornton didn't just tell a story, he delivered a performance of hypnotic weirdness, enjoyable on a primary level. I loved watching the film again, just to see Karl ordering French fries in a burger restaurant: "I reckon I likes me some French fried potaters, mm-hmm". Some people would call it a 'guilty pleasure', it is but it never distracts from the core of the film, which starts with the rediscovery of freedom by a man of limited intelligence and ends with a poignant sacrifice. In between, "Sling Blade" takes us in a small word of bleak simplicity, nothing much happens, people mind their own business, work to pay the bills, and even a man like Karl can find his place if he has, for instance, a certain ability to fix lawnmowers and whatnot. There's a very smoothly handled straightforwardness in Thornton's script, allowing each important character to touch us directly as if it was an old acquaintance. Karl befriends a little boy named Frank and their fondness is as mutual as immediate. It's the kind of genuine friendships that don't need long set-ups, Frank simply 'loves the way Karl talks', and which child wouldn't? He asks his mother if Karl can live in the garage, she accepts. It feels realistic precisely because Linda is the kind of woman who sees good in everyone, and proves it through her boyfriend, an abusive loser played by Dwight Yoakam, and as others mentioned, the second best performance in the film, Oscar-worthy in every level. Doyle is the kind of wannabe rock-star who never got his break and vents his angry frustration on Frank by pretending to be a fatherly figure on the authority department. Otherwise, he spends most of his time lounging on the sofa, drinking beer, bullying Frank and challenging Linda's patience... he doesn't fool anyone. And within this world, Karl acts as a quiet observant. His passiveness mirrors the attitude of the fifth important character in the film, Linda's friend Vaughan, a homosexual forced to live in the town for easily guessable reasons. As a potential victim of intolerance, Vaughan is able to read through Karl's deadpan expression the hints of some inconsolable wounds, and no matter how tough they were, they certainly built an inner goodness in his heart. But Vaughan isn't a "guy" guy and can't fight a man like Doyle, but Karl can help him to take care of Linda and Frank, both would be like guardian angels. John Ritter delivers a magnificent performance in all nuance and subtlety as a man with great humanistic intuition. And indeed, the storyline concurs with Vaughan and we get more insights about Karl's tormented childhood. Karl is a man of good heart who learned to find the good in anyone because he could see the evil in some, including himself. The ensemble cast is so perfect that it's a wonder that the film didn't get more recognition. Yet the pillar of "Sling Blade" is Billy Bob Thornton. He doesn't perform acting, he's literally inhabited by the painful soul of Karl Childers, and he's so absorbing that we're always in the same wavelength. In one of the film's most significant moments, there is a violent argument between Doyle, Linda and Frank while Karl, almost comically, sits there and doesn't move. But look closely at his eyes, his mimics, his reactions when each object thrown by Frank hits Doyle or the wall. Karl is obviously disturbed as if he was witnessing the reminiscence of painful memories. And somewhat he looks determined to accomplish an act of existential gravity, something foreshadowed by the powerful moment when he grabs Doyle's arm and warns him to never lay a finger on little Frank. This very moment starts the countdown of Karl's freedom days. Although predictable, the conclusion doesn't diminish the film's emotional impact. Karl's actions are less eloquent than the last exchanges he had with each protagonist (including Doyle). They all say "Karl!" and keep silent while he leaves as if they resigned to a deadly omen. The film ends as it started, as if nothing changed. Karl sits in the same place, with the same expression; but this time, he refuses to listen to the pervert inmate and tells him straight in the eyes. Although he played a one-note character, Karl did change and for best. Once in his life, he did well by preventing a little child to endure the same hellish childhood. And I can't see but satisfaction in his eyes in the final, haunting shot.

    When I first watched "Sling Blade" about five years ago, I knew nothing about it and thought it was part of the Wesley Snipes vampire suckfest. I was completely unprepared for what has become my #1 favourite movie of all-time. Simply put, "Sling Blade" is the story of mentally-retarded Karl who gets released from "the nervous hospital" after 30 years, having committed a double murder as a young boy. He is taken in by an extremely trusting woman Linda and her young son Frank, who Karl befriends. This all takes place in what is surely one of the hillbilliest reddest-neck towns in Arkansas. To describe the story as big-hearted doesn't suffice, this story is ALL heart. In addition to the warm engaging characters of Karl, Linda and Frank, there's Linda's friend Vaughn, a closeted smalltown gay guy, and even the minor characters like doctors and mechanics are drawn as compassionate caring characters. This movie can remind you of all the good things human beings are capable of, even in dark circumstances. It's far from easy-viewing. Linda's abusive boyfriend Doyle is violent, manipulative, and threatens to destroy Linda and Frank. There are moments that are hard to watch (nothing graphic) and yet you can't turn your eyes away.

    Whenever there's a poll for the "Best Movie Ever Made", _Sling Blade_ should be a contender. It's a winner throughout its long runtime of 2.5 hours; it never bores, not even in the "Director's Cut" version in which previously cut 20 or so minutes are restored. It's a vehicle for the director, writer and main star of _Sling Blade_, Billy Bob Thornton -- and clearly he invested his life's most intense creative effort into this movie (expanded from an earlier short movie of 25 minutes), and all the effort paid off hugely. The acting is uniformly superb, starting with the ingenious creation of the leading character of Karl Childers; the distinctive speech, behaviour, and movement patters of this character are something that's likely to make you smile ever so often even after you get perfectly used to seeing them. It's like the boy says to Karl, "I like the way you talk," and Karl replies: "I like the way *you* talk." Indeed, this reverse is true as well; never has dialectal speech been captured on film more charmingly than Thornton's native Arkansas dialect in _Sling Blade_, so true to life it may sometimes be difficult, even for native English speakers, to understand what is being said, but you won't mind. Hardly anyone can pull off the trick of showing a grown man embracing a boy and saying, "I love you," with the boy replying, "I love you too," without this involving sexual connotations; but Thornton accomplishes the feat here; the relationship and friendship is portrayed as purely Platonic, that is non-sexual (as opposed to the original Greek concept). A huge accomplishment of _Sling Blade_ is on how many levels it is engaging: it's an engrossing, serious, and essentially brutal drama, but in many moments, it's also wonderful comedy; the dramatic and the comedic are often intertwined within the same scene. There's a delightful cameo by another genius film-maker, Jim Jarmusch, as the seller of "French fried potatoes", at the beginning of the movie; there's definitely a spiritual connection, if you will, between _Sling Blade_ and Jarmusch's work; _Sling Blade_ might well be a Jarmusch movie for all you know, and anyone who loves Jim Jarmusch movies will feel right at home in _Sling Blade_. (Speaking of cameos, let's also give credit to Robert Duvall for the few minutes he can be seen here!) Another astonishing achievement of _Sling Blade_ is that even though you have a pretty good idea about how the movie is going to end -- you don't really mind; it's suspenseful throughout. Watching the movie is likely to make you feel desperate, maddeningly helpless; or you might even become a misanthrope; because you realize that it is only through pure accident or lucky (?) chance that Karl was able to rescue (by questionable means) the mother & boy from the abusive live-in boyfriend (fabulously played by Dwight Yoakam: larger than life here, and more menacing than the repeat killer!). But how many abused families, wives, mothers, or children, are there around the world right now, and have been for centuries, and will be for many more centuries to come, yet with no Karl to come to *their* rescue? After you realize this, it really makes you despair of the human race. Especially after you realize that the suffering is at least partly self-inflicted: the mother brought the abuser's affections onto herself willingly, feeling unable to cope with her life situation on her own after her husband commits suicide due to lacking finances to support his family. That is another stinging aspect of _Sling Blade_: portraying the ridiculous materialistic divides between people, even those in their early teens; see the scene where the girl disdainfully speaks of the bouquet of flowers lovingly presented to her as coming "from a dollar store" and therefore being of inferior quality. Other cast members are great, too, particularly Lucas Black in the boy's role, and John Ritter as the overly sensitive -- or is it cowardly? -- but movingly humane dollar-store owner. Fantastic score by David Lanois, especially in the disjointed rock guitar riffs just prior to the murder scene; it's as if the music was mirroring the lead character's unclear state of mind, his decision-making process. It's fascinating that although we observe Karl Childers for 2.5 hours, he's not really a clear-cut, easily labelled person; we struggle, in classifying him, similarly to Vaughan when, in a funny episode, he believes Karl must have been thinking hard, philosophically, about something, although he was only thinking about food right then. And so, even though Karl is clearly mentally handicapped, in other ways he's a genius, representing a character surrounded by a world intrinsically foreign to him ("it's too big," he says at the end); the world at large is different from Karl -- and so anyone who feels estranged in their life situation, can sympathize with Karl; their fate is like that of Karl. And doesn't this apply to all geniuses, or in a sense: to all artists? This was incisively captured by Vaughan when he remarked that "being gay in this small town is like being handicapped"; but the same might be said of people whose intelligence much exceeds that of their surroundings: they will feel similarly estranged. Yet the world in _Sling Blade_ isn't depicted as black-and-white; funnily enough, the only colour eschewed is red (because Thornton dislikes it); otherwise, _Sling Blade_ shows the world and human beings as they are, in their complex entirety and self-contradicting facets: both beautiful (gorgeous backdrops of rural Arkansas!) and at the same time hideous; both cruel and stupid, and simultaneously compassionate and kind (see the warden and his family, or the Bill Cox character who cannot reconcile his "Christian conscience" with keeping Karl locked away for the night, handing him the keys on day 2).

    It was just pure luck I discovered this movie. But thanks to that greater power that I did so. I mean, I love Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, but seriously Academy take that thing back and give it to Thornton. Billy Bob Thornton. Genius. Unbelievable. In the first minutes I could not believe that the man playing Karl is Thornton. His voice alone puts you in a situation, that you want absolute silence, when you're watching the movie. His character makes you smile and cry at the same time... I needed 17 years to discover this movie. I do apologize. Mr.Thornton where are you hiding? No, seriously. Please take out everything you ever had in your mind for an movie and start shooting. Right away. I will see all of them.

    There's no question that without "Sling Blade" Billy Bob Thornton would not have the respect he has today as an artist, even though he's not particularly celebrated for his other films as a director, nor is he particularly admired for his musical career as a country singer/songwriter. Although no one can deny he has had a respectable and prolific acting career, "Sling Blade" definitely stands out as the most beautiful and heartfelt of all of his films. Karl is a middle aged, mentally challenged man who gets released from the mental institution he had been in since he was 12, for having killed his mother and her lover. Out in the real world for the first time in a long time, he soon meets a young kid, Frank, who together with his mother offers Karl a place in their home. However, living with them is Doyle, the mother's evil, alcoholic boyfriend, who is hostile and acts as a mean bully towards the entire family. Although at first it seems that Thornton is doing some overacting as the main protagonist, in the end he clearly is the man stealing the show every time, and creates an utterly memorable character the audience can fall in love with immediately. The power of the film lies in how straightforward and universal it is, even though it takes place in a very unique and specific area, the deep South of the United States. Its themes are about being dear to someone and loving them, and as consequence being able to sacrifice oneself for them. Karl's figure here, although a man with not much mystery (his dark past is immediately revealed, so there's not much else to discover) is almost a divine presence; in the scenes of domestic violence, he silently sits on the edge of the frame, passively witnessing the secretive horrors of abuse. The fact that he gets baptizes by his own will might even imply a Jesus-like figure. Then again, this is not a movie with hidden meanings and obscure symbolism: it's a somewhat Gothic, modern tale told with just as much darkness as tenderness.

    This is one BADASS film! I saw it for the first time 5 or 6 weeks ago. I was AMAZED; by the story, Billy Bob Badass's performance (he was acting, wasn't he?), the directing, the score & the performances of the entire cast, AND the fact that I hadn't seen nor heard of this movie until now. A friend (a long way)from South Carolina played this and two other flicks (Lawless & American History X) for me recently. I was blown away. But Sling Blade was, by far, the best! I have seen hundreds of movies and thousands of acting performances. This is some powerful stuff! This is among the very best. And Thornton.....well, Burton, Anthony Hopkins, Denzel, Jack, Pacino, Sir Lawrence, Sidney, Penn, Kilmer and all of the rest ain't got nothing on him. I don't say that lightly, but I say it all the same.

    Rarely does a film reach the level of perfection achieved by the great films ever made. The Godfather. Slumdog Millionaire. The Fugitive. The Shawshank Redemption. Field Of Dreams. Just to name a few. Sling Blade is one such film. In a career-best, mind-boggling effort, Billy Bob Thornton shines as the star, writer, and director of this amazing film. He plays a curious character named Karl Childers, who's just been released from a mental hospital in the deep south. Karl did something very, very bad many, many years ago, but decades of being institutionalized has weathered him some. He's been set up with a part-time job and a place to stay. At first, we're wondering if Karl can handle all of this. But when he excels at his job and befriends a young boy, Thornton begins a process in which he expounds upon the character of Karl Childers so skillfully, so tenderly, when we know it's Thornton at the helm of the whole thing, you have to be in awe. We grow, rather quickly, to like Karl, and that's the idea. He strikes a chord within us, somewhere deep and primal. And make no mistake, this is anything but an exploitation of the mentally disturbed or anyone else. No, it's a stirring, heartfelt, and heartbreaking portrayal of a man who seemed doomed to redeem himself. The film also benefits from spot-on supporting performances by the likes of Lucas Black, the boy whom Karl befriends, Natalie Canerday as the boy's mother, Dwight Yoakam as her heavy drinking, dim-witted boyfriend, and John Ritter as the mother's best friend. These performances are top-notch all the way around. But what makes it a "perfect" movie is the way Thornton allowed himself as writer, director, and star to explore the character. Karl is simple, but multi-layered. Thornton creates a growth within the character that is as sensible as it is spellbinding. It's a two-hour peak into a world few would imagine if they hadn't seen it, with southern lower-middle class people in a dusty town set against a backdrop of often gorgeous, lush bayou-type settings. It creates a feel, emotionally. One scene in particular, where Karl goes home for the first time in decades, only to find his babbling, accusatory father rotting away in his rocking chair (a brilliant cameo performance by Robert Duvall), is performed with such a brilliant display of poignancy that we're left to wonder what the hell happened to Thornton in the years since this film. While I loved him in The Man Who Wasn't There, I hated him in Armageddon, and Bad Santa, and Mr. Woodcock, and just about everything else I've seen him in since. Those movies may have their moments, in the right time or place, but Sling Blade is timeless, and light years ahead of the vast majority of his other films. In fact, we're not even sure what year it takes place, and it doesn't matter. The mother's boyfriend, who doesn't like Karl or the Ritter character because he's gay, becomes increasingly confrontational and controlling. We feel fearful of what might happen. The bittersweet ending pulls no punches and plays no tricks; we practically expect it, but can't help being engrossed by it. Sling Blade is remarkable film everyone above the age of say, 16, should see. It's touching and powerful, and it's movie magic.

    Sling Blade gets very close to deliver what is promises, "unmistakable drama". Billy Bob's dream project, it shows how passionately and thoughtfully he has pursued it and created a very impressive piece of work. Billy Bob has written, directed and acted the protagonist in the movie of which the latter two are clear winners. Acting: Billy Bob is an amazing actor and it is expected of him to deliver good performance but in 'Karl' he has created an inconceivably beautiful character, I don't like to compare but if it helps you scale, he has become 'Karl' as much as Robert De Niro had become 'Leonard Lowe' in 'Awakenings' and Dustin Hoffman had become 'Raymond Babbitt' in 'Rain Man'. He has created a modern classic protagonist in 'Karl' 10/10 Others have done an above average job which is a shame given that Billy Bob was creating a masterpiece, it would have been great to have others deliver their best too. This makes the whole story slightly weaker and less convincing. Direction: This film doesn't prick you with cheap tricks, it brims ever so nicely with slow intensity, scene after scene, unfolding small events, revealing characters. It creates a piece of life which is real. At no point, this movie imitates it's inspiration, not a single scene is meaningless which tells me the editing is also top class. It makes me want to ask Billy to direct more movies. He has the gift of being honest, real and dispassionate, which I believe is the top most quality of a true director. Script: This is where the great attempt fails and why 'Sling Blade' will not be among the very best of all time. The script is clearly confused between it's innocently presumed hidden yet bare attempt to reveal a complex moral view and the belief and resolution of a single man, in the tussle, the movie is defeated and it completes no meaning which is beautiful in it's own way though it would have otherwise been masterly. Please watch this one urgently!

    Concerned with some of the dark pits of the human soul, Sling Blade is an interesting and emotionally captivating movie to watch. It is a demonstration of how ill behaviour can cause violence to surge up in human relationships... At the same time, Sling Blade points out some socially sensitive truths about the rights of the mentally disabled, as well as the immaturity that (still) exists in our society, regarding how society views them. The viewer cannot help but feel attached to Karl, the mentally disabled protagonist of the story, within the first couple of minutes. Indeed, the acting is great, especially considering that the roles played are not typical ones. There are, however, some flaws in the plot... for example, I cannot believe that Doyle just sat there, pathetically reading his newspaper, waiting to get hit in the head by a lawnmower blade... Even for someone who disrespects and looks down his nose to "retards", I believe that he should have felt at least a bit threatened (this also contradicts his anxiety because of Karl's earlier nightly walk with a hammer). In addition, I just cannot accept that the boy, Frank, took orders from Doyle without resenting and only limited himself to throwing some angry looks. It just doesn't make sense... Also, I don't think that mentally ill people who have been treated and then released back into society would just live without any supervision... I can forgive, at least to some extent, the aforementioned mistakes, since the acting was so great and really convincing... Nevertheless, I don't think Sling Blade is going to stay with me for a long time... It was moving, emotionally intense, and thought-provoking, but it lacked impressiveness. All in all, I would encourage you to watch the movie if you enjoy the genre.

    "Sling Blade" is one of these genuine masterpieces that immediately take you off-guard. As soon as Karl Childers, the central character played by Billy Bob Thornton, starts talking, we know we're unto something new, original and unique. We meet Karl on the day he leaves a mental hospital; he doesn't talk first, forcing himself to listen to one of the inmate's disgusting anecdotes while he stares at the widow. His turn to speak comes when he describes to a young interviewer how he killed his mother and her lover with a Kaiser blade ("some call it a sling blade"). He was a child then and spent a long period trying to socially readjusting himself, mostly through reading Bible, not that he understands a great deal of it, but enough to reckon that people shouldn't kill each other. He talks in the dark, uninterrupted, striking by his raspy voice, colossal jaw and strange rubbing-hands habit highlighting a social unease. His words are punctuated by a weird sound, a "Mm-hmm" growl. Karl easily reminds of Forrest Gump, another mentally challenged character with specific mimics and mannerisms, but he never feels like an imitation, he IS an original and quite memorable creation. And after ten minutes, positive expectations started to invade my thoughts, a movie opening with such an original character and gripping monologue could only lead to cinematic greatness and nothing in the film ever belied my expectations. Thornton didn't just tell a story, he delivered a performance of hypnotic weirdness, enjoyable on a primary level. I loved watching the film again, just to see Karl ordering French fries in a burger restaurant: "I reckon I likes me some French fried potaters, mm-hmm". Some people would call it a 'guilty pleasure', it is but it never distracts from the core of the film, which starts with the rediscovery of freedom by a man of limited intelligence and ends with a poignant sacrifice. In between, "Sling Blade" takes us in a small word of bleak simplicity, nothing much happens, people mind their own business, work to pay the bills, and even a man like Karl can find his place if he has, for instance, a certain ability to fix lawnmowers and whatnot. There's a very smoothly handled straightforwardness in Thornton's script, allowing each important character to touch us directly as if it was an old acquaintance. Karl befriends a little boy named Frank and their fondness is as mutual as immediate. It's the kind of genuine friendships that don't need long set-ups, Frank simply 'loves the way Karl talks', and which child wouldn't? He asks his mother if Karl can live in the garage, she accepts. It feels realistic precisely because Linda is the kind of woman who sees good in everyone, and proves it through her boyfriend, an abusive loser played by Dwight Yoakam, and as others mentioned, the second best performance in the film, Oscar-worthy in every level. Doyle is the kind of wannabe rock-star who never got his break and vents his angry frustration on Frank by pretending to be a fatherly figure on the authority department. Otherwise, he spends most of his time lounging on the sofa, drinking beer, bullying Frank and challenging Linda's patience... he doesn't fool anyone. And within this world, Karl acts as a quiet observant. His passiveness mirrors the attitude of the fifth important character in the film, Linda's friend Vaughan, a homosexual forced to live in the town for easily guessable reasons. As a potential victim of intolerance, Vaughan is able to read through Karl's deadpan expression the hints of some inconsolable wounds, and no matter how tough they were, they certainly built an inner goodness in his heart. But Vaughan isn't a "guy" guy and can't fight a man like Doyle, but Karl can help him to take care of Linda and Frank, both would be like guardian angels. John Ritter delivers a magnificent performance in all nuance and subtlety as a man with great humanistic intuition. And indeed, the storyline concurs with Vaughan and we get more insights about Karl's tormented childhood. Karl is a man of good heart who learned to find the good in anyone because he could see the evil in some, including himself. The ensemble cast is so perfect that it's a wonder that the film didn't get more recognition. Yet the pillar of "Sling Blade" is Billy Bob Thornton. He doesn't perform acting, he's literally inhabited by the painful soul of Karl Childers, and he's so absorbing that we're always in the same wavelength. In one of the film's most significant moments, there is a violent argument between Doyle, Linda and Frank while Karl, almost comically, sits there and doesn't move. But look closely at his eyes, his mimics, his reactions when each object thrown by Frank hits Doyle or the wall. Karl is obviously disturbed as if he was witnessing the reminiscence of painful memories. And somewhat he looks determined to accomplish an act of existential gravity, something foreshadowed by the powerful moment when he grabs Doyle's arm and warns him to never lay a finger on little Frank. This very moment starts the countdown of Karl's freedom days. Although predictable, the conclusion doesn't diminish the film's emotional impact. Karl's actions are less eloquent than the last exchanges he had with each protagonist (including Doyle). They all say "Karl!" and keep silent while he leaves as if they resigned to a deadly omen. The film ends as it started, as if nothing changed. Karl sits in the same place, with the same expression; but this time, he refuses to listen to the pervert inmate and tells him straight in the eyes. Although he played a one-note character, Karl did change and for best. Once in his life, he did well by preventing a little child to endure the same hellish childhood. And I can't see but satisfaction in his eyes in the final, haunting shot.

    When I first watched "Sling Blade" about five years ago, I knew nothing about it and thought it was part of the Wesley Snipes vampire suckfest. I was completely unprepared for what has become my #1 favourite movie of all-time. Simply put, "Sling Blade" is the story of mentally-retarded Karl who gets released from "the nervous hospital" after 30 years, having committed a double murder as a young boy. He is taken in by an extremely trusting woman Linda and her young son Frank, who Karl befriends. This all takes place in what is surely one of the hillbilliest reddest-neck towns in Arkansas. To describe the story as big-hearted doesn't suffice, this story is ALL heart. In addition to the warm engaging characters of Karl, Linda and Frank, there's Linda's friend Vaughn, a closeted smalltown gay guy, and even the minor characters like doctors and mechanics are drawn as compassionate caring characters. This movie can remind you of all the good things human beings are capable of, even in dark circumstances. It's far from easy-viewing. Linda's abusive boyfriend Doyle is violent, manipulative, and threatens to destroy Linda and Frank. There are moments that are hard to watch (nothing graphic) and yet you can't turn your eyes away.

    Whenever there's a poll for the "Best Movie Ever Made", _Sling Blade_ should be a contender. It's a winner throughout its long runtime of 2.5 hours; it never bores, not even in the "Director's Cut" version in which previously cut 20 or so minutes are restored. It's a vehicle for the director, writer and main star of _Sling Blade_, Billy Bob Thornton -- and clearly he invested his life's most intense creative effort into this movie (expanded from an earlier short movie of 25 minutes), and all the effort paid off hugely. The acting is uniformly superb, starting with the ingenious creation of the leading character of Karl Childers; the distinctive speech, behaviour, and movement patters of this character are something that's likely to make you smile ever so often even after you get perfectly used to seeing them. It's like the boy says to Karl, "I like the way you talk," and Karl replies: "I like the way *you* talk." Indeed, this reverse is true as well; never has dialectal speech been captured on film more charmingly than Thornton's native Arkansas dialect in _Sling Blade_, so true to life it may sometimes be difficult, even for native English speakers, to understand what is being said, but you won't mind. Hardly anyone can pull off the trick of showing a grown man embracing a boy and saying, "I love you," with the boy replying, "I love you too," without this involving sexual connotations; but Thornton accomplishes the feat here; the relationship and friendship is portrayed as purely Platonic, that is non-sexual (as opposed to the original Greek concept). A huge accomplishment of _Sling Blade_ is on how many levels it is engaging: it's an engrossing, serious, and essentially brutal drama, but in many moments, it's also wonderful comedy; the dramatic and the comedic are often intertwined within the same scene. There's a delightful cameo by another genius film-maker, Jim Jarmusch, as the seller of "French fried potatoes", at the beginning of the movie; there's definitely a spiritual connection, if you will, between _Sling Blade_ and Jarmusch's work; _Sling Blade_ might well be a Jarmusch movie for all you know, and anyone who loves Jim Jarmusch movies will feel right at home in _Sling Blade_. (Speaking of cameos, let's also give credit to Robert Duvall for the few minutes he can be seen here!) Another astonishing achievement of _Sling Blade_ is that even though you have a pretty good idea about how the movie is going to end -- you don't really mind; it's suspenseful throughout. Watching the movie is likely to make you feel desperate, maddeningly helpless; or you might even become a misanthrope; because you realize that it is only through pure accident or lucky (?) chance that Karl was able to rescue (by questionable means) the mother & boy from the abusive live-in boyfriend (fabulously played by Dwight Yoakam: larger than life here, and more menacing than the repeat killer!). But how many abused families, wives, mothers, or children, are there around the world right now, and have been for centuries, and will be for many more centuries to come, yet with no Karl to come to *their* rescue? After you realize this, it really makes you despair of the human race. Especially after you realize that the suffering is at least partly self-inflicted: the mother brought the abuser's affections onto herself willingly, feeling unable to cope with her life situation on her own after her husband commits suicide due to lacking finances to support his family. That is another stinging aspect of _Sling Blade_: portraying the ridiculous materialistic divides between people, even those in their early teens; see the scene where the girl disdainfully speaks of the bouquet of flowers lovingly presented to her as coming "from a dollar store" and therefore being of inferior quality. Other cast members are great, too, particularly Lucas Black in the boy's role, and John Ritter as the overly sensitive -- or is it cowardly? -- but movingly humane dollar-store owner. Fantastic score by David Lanois, especially in the disjointed rock guitar riffs just prior to the murder scene; it's as if the music was mirroring the lead character's unclear state of mind, his decision-making process. It's fascinating that although we observe Karl Childers for 2.5 hours, he's not really a clear-cut, easily labelled person; we struggle, in classifying him, similarly to Vaughan when, in a funny episode, he believes Karl must have been thinking hard, philosophically, about something, although he was only thinking about food right then. And so, even though Karl is clearly mentally handicapped, in other ways he's a genius, representing a character surrounded by a world intrinsically foreign to him ("it's too big," he says at the end); the world at large is different from Karl -- and so anyone who feels estranged in their life situation, can sympathize with Karl; their fate is like that of Karl. And doesn't this apply to all geniuses, or in a sense: to all artists? This was incisively captured by Vaughan when he remarked that "being gay in this small town is like being handicapped"; but the same might be said of people whose intelligence much exceeds that of their surroundings: they will feel similarly estranged. Yet the world in _Sling Blade_ isn't depicted as black-and-white; funnily enough, the only colour eschewed is red (because Thornton dislikes it); otherwise, _Sling Blade_ shows the world and human beings as they are, in their complex entirety and self-contradicting facets: both beautiful (gorgeous backdrops of rural Arkansas!) and at the same time hideous; both cruel and stupid, and simultaneously compassionate and kind (see the warden and his family, or the Bill Cox character who cannot reconcile his "Christian conscience" with keeping Karl locked away for the night, handing him the keys on day 2).
