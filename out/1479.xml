    I saw this film on Christmas Day in 2001 on PBS. Nine years to the day later it's still as vivid in my memory. After seeing it, as the credits started to roll, so did the tears down my face. It surprises me that I never heard of this film when it came out as it's artistically a gem of a film. The acting is superb of very high caliber. It's got a twisted story in more ways than one, extremely compelling for those that appreciate a complex, tightly woven plot line. If you have ever been betrayed by someone near/dear, this story will reach in on a visceral level and pull you in. The overall message is powerful. It comes full circle from the extreme vulnerability to empowerment as it underscores the moral qualities and staying true to one's core values even in the face of overwhelming adversities. My nephew is going through some hard times, I wish he could see this film today.... Merry Christmas!

    It's always good to see Mia Farrow at work, but she's lost among the snowflakes in this hectic disaster. Farrow, playing wife to Tony Goldwyn (though he's young enough to be her son), appears to be living an idyllic life inside a winter wonderland until one day when she gets a startling dose of reality: her husband admits he's hired a man to kill her. She flees into the night, taking refuge with a bizarre couple who want to help rebuild her existence. Screenwriter Craig Lucas adapted his own play (and brought with it that ridiculous title), and so has no one else to blame for the picture's bumpy rhythm and off-putting characters. The production design and art direction of "Reckless" are both rather interesting, although they are services rendered for an inane and alienating screenplay. It's supposed to be a dark holiday comedy, though the entire cast is at a loss with this unfunny, occasionally offensive material. *1/2 from ****

    This is a movie that I cannot turn away from. Although I have seen it twice in its entirety, I have watched it several more times from the point at which I've stumbled upon it while channel surfing. It's truly a train wreck of a movie - from the claustrophobic scaled-down set of the marital home to the way that Mia Farrow's character becomes the unwitting victim of fate over and over. Although she is the protagonist, for me the story is also about the identity-seeking behaviors of all the supporting characters, their search for meaning and wholeness in their lives, the secrets they keep from each other and their perpetual estrangement and lack of intimacy... just like real life, only narrower and slightly more absurd. For anyone who has had experience with mental health practitioners, who couldn't relate to the parade of therapists projecting their own issues onto Rachel's character, and then validating themselves for helping her? Yes, overall "Reckless" is a sad story but its quirky comedic elements give it enough spice to make it a satisfying if not guilty pleasure.

    I was going to be all apologetic for praising this film, but if you look at the ratings for this in detail you'll see that the MAJORITY of people give this film a rating of 5 and above. So how does IMDb arrive at its "weighted average" of 4.4? Ridiculous. Lots of '9's and '10's--and are we to think that all of those '5's, '6's, '7's, and '8's are put in to 'game the system'? Puh-lease. The only thing that keeps this movie from being a '10' for me is the fact that it's crazy plot developments keep coming and coming and coming, with a ton of false endings. It gives you a headache. But the utter brilliance of so much of this film--Deborah Rush as Trish the embezzler is, all on her own, worth the price of admission! The surprising twists with the Mary-Louise Parker character? The brilliant art direction, with its warped vision of our heroine's world as a winter wonderland in a snow globe gone mad? The plain old beauty of Stephen Dorff? There is A LOT to love about this movie. If you love movies, if you care about and are interested in movies as an art form, you will want to see this movie. It's incredibly funny, it's beautiful, it's strange, it's wearying. It's not for everyone, but I wouldn't want to be everyone. If you're thoughtful, intelligent, and patient, you will appreciate the superb acting, film-making, and atmosphere this film provides.

    Depressing black BLACK comedy about a woman (Mia Farrow) who flees her house on Christmas Eve when she discovers her husband (Tony Goldwyn) has hired a hit man to kill her. She ends up with a husband and wife (Scott Glenn and Mary-Louise Parker) and then things go wrong. Basically Farrow keeps running and is continuously meeting VERY strange people and getting into morbidly unfunny situations. This was advertised as a feel good movie when I saw it around Christmas time at its VERY short run in an art cinema. I found it sick, unfunny and just depressing. I like black humor but this was WAY too dark for me. What happens to Parker's character especially was horrifying. To make matters worse Eileen Brennan is thrown in as a nun (!!!) later on and proceeds to chew the scenery with gusto. The only saving grace was Farrow's acting--it's much better than this picture deserves. Also it was a relief to see the very talented Stephen Dorff pop up at the end. The ending itself was kind of nice but it couldn't erase what had gone on before. Sick, morbid, pitch black "comedy". A 1

    the boy's mother left him, so in his mind to deal with it, he made up this whole crazy(hilarious, bizarre) story about hit men, poisonings, blood spraying, didn't you notice how it skips years instantaneously, at one point skipping 7 years at once, its because hes been told a couple of things, and he fills in the rest! , It is absolutely all a dream! it is all made up by the son, that is why it seems so ridiculous, . think about it, that totally ridiculous gameshow with the freaky outfits, the acid trip landscapes, and the bizarre events that seem to happen to her every 30 seconds, even though the movie spans over at least ten years. the reason everything in this movie seems too good or bad to be reality, is, ***its not!!! its in his head****!!!

    I happened to tape this film from TV, and it has become one of my favorites. Whatever failings it may have, and I think it has fewer failings than some might think, it is in its way a tour de force of originality. The combination of gritty downfall with under-the-Christmas-tree fantasy works very well -- and that in itself is an achievement. Its charms, by and large, are the small things, the incidental scenes that are accomplished in a unique manner, such as a conversation in American sign language between two women who are wearing large, yellow rubber gloves (in the scene they are cleaning a carpet). While I concede that the title seems fairly arbitrary, it certainly does the film no harm, no more than "Magnolia" did any harm to that film, even though "Magnolia" is surely just as arbitrary a title for "Magnolia" as "Reckless" is for "Reckless." In my view, a film that is unique (as well as uniquely quirky), visually witty, and that can arouse and explore entirely new and unexpected emotional territory in the viewer is a film of value. Mia Farrow's and Scott Glenn's performances are excellent. I would encourage anyone who wants to see something that is entirely different from anything else and that will make an indelible impression, would do well to see this film. And don't worry, the script is just fine; although it is a morality tale, it is not a morality tale with a smug or pat conclusion, as it ends, as it begins, with a weirdly satisfying sort of open-ended grace.

    Mia Farrow in an improbable tale of woe rivaling a Shakespearian tragedy for sheer unfortunate-ness. If this movie had a more revealing title I suppose I would call it "the nastiest of consequences for the most innocent and well-intentioned of actions." All the characters you like will be punished (not a spoiler - as we may not like the same characters). From bad to worse, from lonely to destitute, from depressing to macabre: this movie will make you feel better about you. Wherever you are, this lady is lower. The sympathy and camaraderie this movie generates for it's soft-spoken well-meaning heroine is the sharp tip that drives the depressing point home. The character's unwavering goodness in the face of (well I suppose it is rather conspicuous) misfortune is inspirational. Beautiful. I want to live again.

    This is an excellent film by Norman Rene. The final installment of three films that Rene made. I thought it was beautifully done and particularly loved Mia Farrow in this film. For me, the film exploresidentity in the same ways as his earlier film, prelude to a kiss.... and perhaps also explores issues related to HIV/AIDS, much like his earlier two films. This is NOT the stage play, like any film of previously written material it illustrates the directors point of view. I highly recommend this film, it's a rare delight W

    Even though this was one of the strangest movies I have ever seen, it kept you wondering what could possibly happen next. I love most of Mary Louise Parker's performances and this was no different. She has the ability to bring so much to every character she plays. The movie follows Mia Farrow's character through various changes in her life and how she deals with each of them. It isn't an award winning movie by any means, but will make you think. I highly recommend it. I would have probably never stumbled across this movie if Tivo hadn't told me that Stephen Dorff was in it. Even though his part was very small I was glad that it brought me to the movie in the first place. I have to say that I'm happy to see that they are turning the movie into a Broadway play with Mary Louise Parker in the cast. I think it will be a must see.
