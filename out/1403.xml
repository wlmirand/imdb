    Apart from Roman Holiday,Caro diario is another brilliant film which shows its protagonist ride a common man's preferred mode of transport,a scooter in order to explore some essential,life affirming themes which are close to a sensible human being's heart.In this film, Italian actor/director Nanni Moretti has established absolutely complete control of the cinema medium as he appears to be perfectly aware of the stories which need to be told and the manner in which they would be told. This is the reason why Caro Diario mixes comedy and drama in equal proportions to retain viewers' attention.As a cinema professional Nanni Moretti makes pertinent observations about cinema and television and the role played by both these entertainment forms.His stance appears to be impartial when he talks about the role played by film critics in the dissemination of cinema culture.By taking viewers close to the spot where Pasolini died in 1975,Nanni Moretti accurately proves that only a cinema person can be in a comfortable position to speak about another cinema person.The general mood of Italian nation and irregularities seen in health care system have also been portrayed in a frank yet non polemical manner by Nanni Moretti.Lastly, Caro Diario is the best example of a film which treats serious issues in a light manner.

    The book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die has been very useful to find great films I have never seen before, and sometimes even films that I either forgot all about, or missed the opportunity to watch, and this is one of the films I could have seen but didn't. Basically this is pretty much an autobiography as Golden Globe nominated director Nanni Moretti plays himself and tells his own story in three chapters, taken from extracts of his diary. Part one sees him riding a scooter through the streets of a near empty Rome, visiting architectures and monuments, his critiques of Hollywood and Italian films - including the repetitive playing of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, and a chance meeting with Flashdance actress Jennifer Beals. Part two sees Nanni heading for the Aeolian Islands, travelling to Lipari visiting his friend Gerardo (Renato Carpentieri), then moving to the Salinda Islands after tourist problems, then moving again after irritation to Stromboli where he gets hooked into more soap operas, and again moving to Alicudi which has no electricity and lacks water. Part three sees him suffering a disease and insomnia, in real life as well, going through various doctors who give him different opinions and diagnoses, and finally X-rays show he has a lung problem with a treatable tumour, and it concludes with him finding a medical encyclopedia and having a sarcastic toast. Also starring Giovanna Bozzolo as Actor in Italian Film, Sebastiano Nardone as Actor in Italian Film, Antonio Petrocelli as Actor in Italian Film, Giulio Base as Car Driver, Italo Spinelli as On the Wall at Spinaceto, Alexandre Rockwell, Carlo Mazzacurati as Film Critic, Raffaella Lebboroni as First Salina Couple, Marco Paolini as First Salina Couple, Claudia Della Seta as Second Salina Couple, Lorenzo Alessandri as Second Salina Couple, Valerio Magrelli as Dermatologist, Roberto Nobile as Dermatologist, Sergio Lambiase as Dermatologist and Antonio Neiwiller as The Mayor of Stromboli. Being based on the director's own experiences this is the most conventional of films, and that is why for most of the way it is interesting, most of the good stuff comes from the sights of the landscapes and cities on the journey, and the real life illness part gives it some poignancy, so overall while I didn't understand all of it, it is a watchable biographical comedy drama. It won the Golden Globe for Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Original Score for Nicola Piovani. Very good!

    Ninno Morretti hops on go his Vespa and the first segment of this traveling diary, ventures throughout Rome to different neighborhoods, encountering a variety of interesting people along the way, including Jennifer Beals of Flashdance fame which Morretti says changed his life forever. He stops in stops in a cinema and watches the bloody American film Henry: portrait of a serial killer and is disgusted by it and berates a critic who gave the violent saga a positive review. Segment two of the diary is Ninni' s venture to the nearby islands by cruise ship. He meets a mother and father who describe in full detail the spotty training of their young son. What follows is rapid fire shots of adults at phone booths trying in vain to get the kids who answer to bring parent to the phone. Overindulgent mommies and daddies dominate the island portion of the diary. Morretti also visits Stromboli's volcano. Alicudi is the last island, totally isolated, without electricity and filled with hermits. The third and final chapter is the doctors where Morretti undergoes chemotherapy for cancer. H's also suffers from severe itching on his hands and feet and proceeds to visit several doctors for a cure, trying every type of medicine possible. He finally gets an answer at the end.

    Caro Diario is one my favorite films. The effortless narration of Moretti makes you forget you're watching a film. It feels rather like listening to familiar thoughts. The vespa scenes are amazing... This film concentrates all the ingredients of European cinema at just the right portions. The honesty of this film makes it so much more than it might appear to be. Moretti "elevates" the viewer to his place and I think this is wonderful (apart from difficult). I find Caro Diario simple, sensitive, interesting, amusing, romantic, thought provoking, funny (I could go on ..) and therefore believe it deserves our appreciation. If you're a classic Hollywood blockbuster buff this might not appeal to you, still if there's any film that might take you to the other side this is it. Â… after all this is cinema for humans.

    Free flowing, naturally witty, at times very funny film, accompanied with some wonderful music, especially during scenes where Moretti rides his Vespa in beautiful, empty streets of Rome's suburbs. The film is not like any other director's take on society while blending his personal stories in it. Imagine Moretti being your guide and taking you around Rome and Italian islands, introducing layers of the Italian society with razor sharp and witty observations. Many of the characters in the film will seem familiar to people around the world. Being unable to afford an apartment in his home town, frustration with doctors and their addiction to prescribe drugs, parents becoming hostage to their child, extreme want for change and development, people offering hedonistic capitalism, frustrated narcissists living in isolation. And TV addiction! The scene where Moretti rides his scooter to the place where Passolini is murdered has almost a dreamy barren atmosphere to it and possibly is the saddest part. And there are hilarious moments, especially the visits to the islands are a real treat! It was also great to see Jennifer Beals, Flashdance being one of my favorites too. This is a gem, or better yet, a cult movie.

    Where to begin with the riches Moretti gives us to savour long after the movie ends. Among the countless highpoints are his rave against movie critics, the thwarted attempts of parents on Salina to contact their friends by telephone, the determined efforts to find out what is happening in "The Bold and the Beautiful", a scary/funny diatribe about the medical profession and the highlight for me - Silvano Mangano sings and dances in a clip from the 1951 movie "Anna". Moretti is a cagey devil. He has a lot to say about current issues but he clouds his razor intellect in a sweet vapour of music, friendship and philosophy. Don't miss the Vespa ride to find the death place of Pasolini. The person who can turn a long scooter ride through an unsightly part of Rome into a transcendental experience is to be treasured.

    Posters prefer, so it seems, the first two segments of Dear Diary. I thought that the last one, where NM is itching like crazy is absolutely brilliant and beyond brilliant. If you've been sick with god knows what, then you may well have had the same voyage as he. No one has ever captured on film, to my knowledge, why and how doctors, famed and not famed, traditional and alternative, are so dammed frustrating when you have a problem that doesn't quit. I found myself relating totally to Moretti's utter frustration and since it ended without resolution re: his cancer, I can only assume he beat it. Many times I or someone I love has this same tortuous struggle to find A SINGLE healer who really knows what gives. I found the cancer scenes very touching but it was the 8 months of itching and trying so many meds and accupuncture most true to our lousy medical situations. So many and none got it, until one did correctly diagnose him. I relate! And he's not Woody Allen, whose films I usually soak up, he's unique and brave and extremely intelligent. Thanks for listening.

    This film is BORING, BORING, BORING, BORING, and BORING!!! It's not the worse film I ever saw, on the contrary, but.......how shall I put this.......IT'S BORING! There is some very nice scenery and some clever dry wit but that's about it. If it was advertised as a travelogue I would rate it a 7 but it's supposed to be a film with a plot, some drama, and for god's sake a point or a satisfying conclusion. I read some of the comments on this board about this films and I wondered if they saw the same movie as I did. See this film (yawn) at your own risk........one thing for sure- it really is rated correctly= G RATING! (Which most stand for GOD AWFUL BORING!)

    At first I was ready to turn this movie off , but Nanni's voice caught hold and I was glad I watched it . What a pleasant voice and tongue-in-cheek narration. The TV thing was a riot, as was the Dr. prescription part. You will enjoy this film, especially if you enjoy the Italian mind set. The hunt for peace and quiet is so close to everyday life that it fits like a glove. I was not aware of Nanni until I saw this title on the movie list on the Dish. I recorded it and played it back later. The cinematography is beautiful and the main character (Nanni) has an infectious voice and deadpan face. which makes the movie all the more enjoyable. I give this great flik 8/10 ciao yaaah69

    I have to disagree with the review from owenmoney. Caro Diario is a good film: but it isn't Hollywood, it isn't a britflick, it isn't a film made to do business outside of Italy and at a stretch Europe. Hard to believe I know! This film is full of in-jokes that only Italians or people who have lived there will get. The boy Gianni (I can't spell his surname but I'm sure he'll forgive me) now spends a lot of time organising people to hold hands around buildings in political protests: I haven't read the Italian papers for a while but I suspect he harbours certain aspirations. He is essentially playing himself or his public persona because he's at times long-winded but generally entertaining. It's a film for people with an interest in Italy. The subtle things that are so clear to a foreigners probably passed over the heads of those on set, which is what makes it so endearing. But don't rent it because the Incredibles was out or because you feel sophisticated in watching something with subtitles.

    The book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die has been very useful to find great films I have never seen before, and sometimes even films that I either forgot all about, or missed the opportunity to watch, and this is one of the films I could have seen but didn't. Basically this is pretty much an autobiography as Golden Globe nominated director Nanni Moretti plays himself and tells his own story in three chapters, taken from extracts of his diary. Part one sees him riding a scooter through the streets of a near empty Rome, visiting architectures and monuments, his critiques of Hollywood and Italian films - including the repetitive playing of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, and a chance meeting with Flashdance actress Jennifer Beals. Part two sees Nanni heading for the Aeolian Islands, travelling to Lipari visiting his friend Gerardo (Renato Carpentieri), then moving to the Salinda Islands after tourist problems, then moving again after irritation to Stromboli where he gets hooked into more soap operas, and again moving to Alicudi which has no electricity and lacks water. Part three sees him suffering a disease and insomnia, in real life as well, going through various doctors who give him different opinions and diagnoses, and finally X-rays show he has a lung problem with a treatable tumour, and it concludes with him finding a medical encyclopedia and having a sarcastic toast. Also starring Giovanna Bozzolo as Actor in Italian Film, Sebastiano Nardone as Actor in Italian Film, Antonio Petrocelli as Actor in Italian Film, Giulio Base as Car Driver, Italo Spinelli as On the Wall at Spinaceto, Alexandre Rockwell, Carlo Mazzacurati as Film Critic, Raffaella Lebboroni as First Salina Couple, Marco Paolini as First Salina Couple, Claudia Della Seta as Second Salina Couple, Lorenzo Alessandri as Second Salina Couple, Valerio Magrelli as Dermatologist, Roberto Nobile as Dermatologist, Sergio Lambiase as Dermatologist and Antonio Neiwiller as The Mayor of Stromboli. Being based on the director's own experiences this is the most conventional of films, and that is why for most of the way it is interesting, most of the good stuff comes from the sights of the landscapes and cities on the journey, and the real life illness part gives it some poignancy, so overall while I didn't understand all of it, it is a watchable biographical comedy drama. It won the Golden Globe for Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Original Score for Nicola Piovani. Very good!

    Ninno Morretti hops on go his Vespa and the first segment of this traveling diary, ventures throughout Rome to different neighborhoods, encountering a variety of interesting people along the way, including Jennifer Beals of Flashdance fame which Morretti says changed his life forever. He stops in stops in a cinema and watches the bloody American film Henry: portrait of a serial killer and is disgusted by it and berates a critic who gave the violent saga a positive review. Segment two of the diary is Ninni' s venture to the nearby islands by cruise ship. He meets a mother and father who describe in full detail the spotty training of their young son. What follows is rapid fire shots of adults at phone booths trying in vain to get the kids who answer to bring parent to the phone. Overindulgent mommies and daddies dominate the island portion of the diary. Morretti also visits Stromboli's volcano. Alicudi is the last island, totally isolated, without electricity and filled with hermits. The third and final chapter is the doctors where Morretti undergoes chemotherapy for cancer. H's also suffers from severe itching on his hands and feet and proceeds to visit several doctors for a cure, trying every type of medicine possible. He finally gets an answer at the end.

    Caro Diario is one my favorite films. The effortless narration of Moretti makes you forget you're watching a film. It feels rather like listening to familiar thoughts. The vespa scenes are amazing... This film concentrates all the ingredients of European cinema at just the right portions. The honesty of this film makes it so much more than it might appear to be. Moretti "elevates" the viewer to his place and I think this is wonderful (apart from difficult). I find Caro Diario simple, sensitive, interesting, amusing, romantic, thought provoking, funny (I could go on ..) and therefore believe it deserves our appreciation. If you're a classic Hollywood blockbuster buff this might not appeal to you, still if there's any film that might take you to the other side this is it. Â… after all this is cinema for humans.

    Free flowing, naturally witty, at times very funny film, accompanied with some wonderful music, especially during scenes where Moretti rides his Vespa in beautiful, empty streets of Rome's suburbs. The film is not like any other director's take on society while blending his personal stories in it. Imagine Moretti being your guide and taking you around Rome and Italian islands, introducing layers of the Italian society with razor sharp and witty observations. Many of the characters in the film will seem familiar to people around the world. Being unable to afford an apartment in his home town, frustration with doctors and their addiction to prescribe drugs, parents becoming hostage to their child, extreme want for change and development, people offering hedonistic capitalism, frustrated narcissists living in isolation. And TV addiction! The scene where Moretti rides his scooter to the place where Passolini is murdered has almost a dreamy barren atmosphere to it and possibly is the saddest part. And there are hilarious moments, especially the visits to the islands are a real treat! It was also great to see Jennifer Beals, Flashdance being one of my favorites too. This is a gem, or better yet, a cult movie.

    Where to begin with the riches Moretti gives us to savour long after the movie ends. Among the countless highpoints are his rave against movie critics, the thwarted attempts of parents on Salina to contact their friends by telephone, the determined efforts to find out what is happening in "The Bold and the Beautiful", a scary/funny diatribe about the medical profession and the highlight for me - Silvano Mangano sings and dances in a clip from the 1951 movie "Anna". Moretti is a cagey devil. He has a lot to say about current issues but he clouds his razor intellect in a sweet vapour of music, friendship and philosophy. Don't miss the Vespa ride to find the death place of Pasolini. The person who can turn a long scooter ride through an unsightly part of Rome into a transcendental experience is to be treasured.

    Posters prefer, so it seems, the first two segments of Dear Diary. I thought that the last one, where NM is itching like crazy is absolutely brilliant and beyond brilliant. If you've been sick with god knows what, then you may well have had the same voyage as he. No one has ever captured on film, to my knowledge, why and how doctors, famed and not famed, traditional and alternative, are so dammed frustrating when you have a problem that doesn't quit. I found myself relating totally to Moretti's utter frustration and since it ended without resolution re: his cancer, I can only assume he beat it. Many times I or someone I love has this same tortuous struggle to find A SINGLE healer who really knows what gives. I found the cancer scenes very touching but it was the 8 months of itching and trying so many meds and accupuncture most true to our lousy medical situations. So many and none got it, until one did correctly diagnose him. I relate! And he's not Woody Allen, whose films I usually soak up, he's unique and brave and extremely intelligent. Thanks for listening.

    This film is BORING, BORING, BORING, BORING, and BORING!!! It's not the worse film I ever saw, on the contrary, but.......how shall I put this.......IT'S BORING! There is some very nice scenery and some clever dry wit but that's about it. If it was advertised as a travelogue I would rate it a 7 but it's supposed to be a film with a plot, some drama, and for god's sake a point or a satisfying conclusion. I read some of the comments on this board about this films and I wondered if they saw the same movie as I did. See this film (yawn) at your own risk........one thing for sure- it really is rated correctly= G RATING! (Which most stand for GOD AWFUL BORING!)

    At first I was ready to turn this movie off , but Nanni's voice caught hold and I was glad I watched it . What a pleasant voice and tongue-in-cheek narration. The TV thing was a riot, as was the Dr. prescription part. You will enjoy this film, especially if you enjoy the Italian mind set. The hunt for peace and quiet is so close to everyday life that it fits like a glove. I was not aware of Nanni until I saw this title on the movie list on the Dish. I recorded it and played it back later. The cinematography is beautiful and the main character (Nanni) has an infectious voice and deadpan face. which makes the movie all the more enjoyable. I give this great flik 8/10 ciao yaaah69

    I have to disagree with the review from owenmoney. Caro Diario is a good film: but it isn't Hollywood, it isn't a britflick, it isn't a film made to do business outside of Italy and at a stretch Europe. Hard to believe I know! This film is full of in-jokes that only Italians or people who have lived there will get. The boy Gianni (I can't spell his surname but I'm sure he'll forgive me) now spends a lot of time organising people to hold hands around buildings in political protests: I haven't read the Italian papers for a while but I suspect he harbours certain aspirations. He is essentially playing himself or his public persona because he's at times long-winded but generally entertaining. It's a film for people with an interest in Italy. The subtle things that are so clear to a foreigners probably passed over the heads of those on set, which is what makes it so endearing. But don't rent it because the Incredibles was out or because you feel sophisticated in watching something with subtitles.
