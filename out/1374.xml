    Michelle Pfeiffer looks absolutely gorgeous in one of her first movie features, and her being in it is probably what is best known about it, since the box cover of the movie has her face all over it even though she plays a supporting character. The main character of the film is Harry Lewis (Elliott Gould), a failed architect who is haunted by his own past, so decides to take his kids and wife Sue (Susannah York) on a road trip to the Bronx so that he can re-visit his youth. The story about the road trip is mixed with scenes from Harry's past, in 1940s New York, where he dreams big and meets and courts Sue. The problem with having these stories running parallel is that even though the flashbacks are of a rom-commy nature, since we already know that Sue is Harry's wife in the present, there is not really too much excitement. The actors playing in the flashbacks are horrendously bad, including Pfeiffer and her ridiculous British accent, and while the actors in the present day are good, they don't get a lot of time on screen. On top of that, processions are slow and the film is a real sleeper, so I would recommend people to stay away from it if you're not obsessed with Pfeiffers early movie work.

    An architect misses his childhood years. So he packs up his family -his wife and children- and heads where he grew up: Bronx, NYC. His memories from the old times begins to revive. There goes the story line: His buddies, his folks, his first love... Old times are introduced very nostalgically. Through those times there are both funny and meaningful moments of cinematography. His first love, who is currently his wife, has characteristically altered into someone else according to him, as time went by. He recalls all the sweet memories of sharing love with her wife; so he tries to figure out what led to that unforeseen change of his wife's attitudes, what wounds she might have accumulated in her soul. He tries to discover what made one of them abandon their used-to-be forever love. This discovery will rekindle his old feelings for her, and thus it will also make her love him back again for their old times' sake. For every loving couple, whose love is expired through time must have experienced these searchings for a cure of lost-love crisis in their relationship. If not yet, now is the time.

    Let me count the ways Bad acting. Bad sound. Bad Music. A few songs are OK. Miscasted actors. 30 yr olds playing teens. Bad Accents. Michelle P's is the worst. Bad Costumes. The whole movie had a surreal feel. Not in a good way either. Eliott G only has little face time. Yet Narrates through-out. The "older woman/kisser" is way hotter than Michelle P. I count nine, so far. The list is almost endless. This movie goes on my all-time-stinker list. Only watch it for the insane novelty of it. It's like those bowery boy movies from the 1940's only not funny. Yuck....................................What a stinker.

    If you like romantic, nostalgic films about rediscovered old loves and never-forgotten old friendships, look for this film (which may be a bit of a challenge) and see it again and again. I recall that some reviews on FILA were unflattering at time of release, but I've learned that too many films that we now consider terrifically entertaining and fulfilling over the years were never graced with approval at time of release by some reviewers - while conversely, some real celluloid stinkers have enjoyed critical support. The reasons for this were never clear to me as a paying film-goer. I recommend this heartily to all. (And remember to remain through the credits for the unforgettable closing song, a lost classic from Johnny Mathis, Carol Connors and Michel LeGrand.)
