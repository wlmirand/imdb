    The Full Monty came out in 1997 with a small four million dollar budget and grossed more than forty million dollars at the US box office and also was nominated for four academy awards including best picture. More than ten years later, it rightfully obtains its cult status. The movie is set in the famous steel making town of Sheffield, England. So once people start loosing their jobs, six unemployed factory workers (Gaz,Gerald, Dave, Nathan Lomper, and Horse) decide to become male strippers, much to the disapproval of their families. Gaz is divorced and wants full custody of his son. Gerald is lying to his wife, telling her that they can go on vacation, but he has no money, and needs the job. Dave is depressed and thinks his wife is cheating on him. Horse is an aging break dancer and wants to be back on top. Lomper is suicidal and needs something to believe in and Nathan is obsessed with Singin' In The Rain. They all decide to perform the full Monty-or completely nude. The story is simple, and feel good, but also rather predictable. But the outcome does not matter when the ride is so much fun. The Full Monty: *** stars

    Ah, The Full Monty - it warms the cockles of your heart and revives your faith in human nature.&nbsp; From the beguiling Yorkshire accents, to the ubiquitous swearing, to the liberal&nbsp; sprinklings of political incorrectness throughout, I defy anyone not love this unassuming, feel-good British comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set in Sheffield in the 80s when unemployment was rife and men were skint, this movie truly catches the spirit of the times while evoking a strange nostalgia for that shared experience of joblessness and economic doom in 80s working class Britain.&nbsp; The Full Monty comprises a motley crew of disaffected and seemingly mismatched men,&nbsp; several of whom lost their jobs in the collapse of the steel industry, and follows their day to day life as they attempt to set up a striptease act to rival the Chippendales (and, of course, earn some ready cash).&nbsp; Main man, Gav (Robert Carlyle) with his weasly face, and exasperated cries of 'foookin' 'ell!' every five minutes is bloody brilliant as is 'fat bastard' Dave (Mark Addy), and pale, suicidal carrot- top, Lomper (Steve Huison).&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as superbly showcasing working class life with all it's social problems, ugliness and pathos, The Full Monty touches on broken relationships, homosexuality and the shame and hardship of long term unemployment.&nbsp; However, the joy of this movie is that despite the struggles of these men and their families, there are no pity fests; life is what it is and you just get on with it.&nbsp; The buoyancy, cheek and unerring spiritedness&nbsp; of the characters&nbsp; keeps you smiling .&nbsp; Dancing in the dole queue, g-strings in the sitting room and cling film in the potting shed, this film's got it all - and the world is a better place for it.

    There are very few films these days that make me laugh out loud but this one managed it six or seven times! Having spent most of my adult life in the north of England, I find the humour in this one quite refreshing. It's not all fun and games though, there is quite a lot of drama to be found here and it's this element that gives the humour more bite. Great performances all round with (for me), Tom Wilkinson standing out, although they were all praiseworthy. Over all, a comedy set against the gritty reality of unemployment and all that brings. If, like me, you've been avoiding this one, don't put it off any longer, you can thank me later! SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.7/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    In the 1970's, Sheffield, England was a booming city that had a very uplifting economy and steel was the hottest staple that came out at that time as a public relations informer told me. By the 1990's came around, due to lack of funding, a lot of the steel mills were sadly foreclosed. Unemployment was on the rise, people had to seek jobs elsewhere and those who have built their reputation in these companies struggled to adapt to either menial jobs or just plain stayed home and just collected welfare checks. Gaz (Robert Carlyle "Once Upon A Time") who's a divorced man lost custody to his teenage son as his wife found another man, who happens to be more financially secure than him. He continues to make sporadic visits on occasion to see his son Nathan (Willian Snape), but goes beyond as he makes Nathan a close companion. Desperate for money, Gaz finds a way he can make a substantial amount of cash. After hearing about a group of male strippers called the Chippendales come to town they seem to make a rather handsome profit in a rented hall that's usually packed. Gaz along with his friend Dave (Mark Addy) believe they could make the same amount by putting on a similar show. The only problem is that the gentlemen they recruit to bare their all are just average looking people, not the same type of prim and dashing individuals that are the Chippendales. And what's even worse is that their dancing skills are even worst than me (which is bad because I'm in theatre). The rest of the ragtag wannabe strippers include a former factory foreman Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), and a drifter named Horse (Paul Barber) who in spite of a bad hip is able to teach them a few moves. What's very curious to me is why in the world would these women be interested in seeing not so good-looking guys take their clothes off after getting much satisfaction from the Chippendales? Gaz suggests that they might get the upper hand if they're brave enough to go the full monty by baring all. The whole idea was trashed from the start as they fear that their bodies just don't have that mass appeal to get ladies the attention as one fears he's too skinny, the other fears he's too obese and the other is just too old to bear all. In all seriousness, "The Full Monty" touches on issues about finding work and that even though it's great and rewarding to have a job, there's always a possibility that the company you work for will not be around forever. And when you lose that job because of foreclosure you feel like everything you have done was all for nought. Sheffield is the primarily example of a once sprawling city where the power balance between men and women were abolished because men in that town were unable to provide for their families. Gerald who has not had a job in six months has been lying to his wife. But when he could no longer provide for his family, his wife wants him to break up. This might have happened in Gaz's situation with his wife before the movie takes off. The film closely links Dave's insecurities is to do anything to avoid becoming jobless. In fact the closest relationship is with Dave and his wife. The cast is entirely British and most people who live on North American soil may not be familiar to this group of relative unknowns. Carlyle is probably best known for his role as Mr. Gold (Rumpelstiltskin) from the TV series "Once Upon a Time", but even though he is the leading performer here, his performance is not the best one here. The real standouts are Addy's Dave and Wilkinson's Gerald. We root for the men not because they're bearing their gifts to the ladies, but because these men are trying to win back their livelihood so they could become more employable. Wilkinson seems to be the most comfortable of the trio, but his opportunities are quite scarce and it shows. Too bad that Paul Barber's Horse doesn't get much airtime. He seemed more energetic of the characters but there was not much story to make him more developed. "The Full Monty" is one of many films to feature the poor state of the British economy In some ways it's a bit of an homage to "Brassed Off". Even the brass band featured in a dire situation in an early scene was just pure irony. But it's still a good comedy and even though it's over-the-top in content, the situation the characters face are real and may reflect that of the situation of the economy we're facing as I speak.

    Sometimes the timing of a film's release is so accidentally perfect that it captures the mood of the public and becomes a hit. Such a film is The Full Monty. Made on a meagre budget of &pound;3 million, this small Sheffield-set comedy-drama went to achieve unprecedented commercial and critical success. It became the highest grossing film to that point at the UK box office; was nominated for the prestigious Best Picture Oscar (losing out to Titanic); and scooped several BAFTAs including Best Film and Best Actor for Robert Carlyle. A fine haul indeed for a modest little production set in a run-down neighbourhood of the steel city. Struggling ex-steelworkers Gaz (Robert Carlyle) and Dave (Mark Addy) spend their days breaking into shut-down steel mills searching for scrap metal to steal and sell. Sometimes they are joined by Gaz's son Nathan (William Snape), his child from a broken relationship with ex-wife Mandy (Emily Woof). One day Gaz notices a number of women entering a local social club and discovers that they are going to watch a male strip show. He hits upon the idea of raising a little money by putting on his own show. Enlisting other unemployed desperadoes like his former manager Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), ex-security guard Lomper (Steve Huison), smooth mover Horse (Paul Barber) and well-endowed hunk Guy (Hugo Speer), the unlikely lotharios set about practising their dance moves and perfecting a raunchy routine. The stakes are upped considerably when some women spot the lads putting up posters to advertise their show. When the women laugh off their ambitious scheme, Gaz decides to up the ante by telling them they will be going "the Full Monty" (fully naked). "Nobody said anything to me about the Full Monty!" gasps Horse, but his protests come too late the word is already out and the guys have a 400-strong audience of baying women to satisfy. In truth, The Full Monty could quite easily have turned up as a feature length TV-style drama - at first glance it certainly isn't an especially cinematic sort of film (e.g. a film that belongs on the big screen). Thanks to Simon Beaufoy's cracking script and the game performances, it transcends its small roots to become a thoroughly enjoyable story indeed. Performances that stand out include Carlyle as the desperate Gaz, Addy as the terribly self-conscious and overweight Dave, and Wilkinson as their once-proud manager, now reduced to teaching a bunch of 'commoners' to dance (as well as joining them in their potentially humiliating enterprise). Most of the performances are strong right down the cast list, but these three are a notch ahead of the rest. The dialogue is often very funny and the grim locations add to the film's sense of social deprivation and desperation. Like most comedies, repeat viewings gradually diminish the film's humour and freshness but first time round it is a vastly entertaining film, successfully managing to generate a feel-good atmosphere within its grimmest of settings. Director Peter Cattaneo never really pushed on after The Full Monty  to date he has only made three other features (none of which match the giddy heights of this one). It's a shame that he hasn't been able to capitalise on such a phenomenally successful debut. As Yorkshire-based cinema goes, The Full Monty is the most successful film ever to have come out of the region. It's also one of the best.

    I am not somebody who has any problems with dirty humor or is too prude to watch a movie with a sexual plot. And yet I am very impressed how they managed to take the storyline about men becoming strippers and produce a movie that is so sweet and in a way innocent. I am even surprised it was R rated. The reason is that we get to know the characters from their vulnerable side. We can see their desperation that drives them to this decision and we can feel their insecurities. I don't want to make it sound as if it is some tear jerker, it is not. In fact it is a very funny movie, but at the same time it has so much humanity. The best scenes in the movie are the auditions and practice scenes. Hilarious. I definitely recommend this movie. It is funny, light hearted and with great acting. But people who have the same problem as me in understanding accents should make sure they have captions on.

    The thing that stands out about this movie is that it seemed to have brought a new phrase into the English language, and that is "going the full monty." Generally it means to take off all of your clothes, but in another way it simply means going all of the way. One thing is true, not many movies can claim to have had an impact on the English language, but this one has. Now, the concept of a movie about male strippers doesn't really appeal to me. One would expect it to be rated R, but it is not. The ratings say that it contains nudity, but for an M rating all you can expect to see is bare bums, and yes that is what you do see. The Full Monty is actually about much more than simple male strippers: it is about self pride, image, unemployment, and simple trust. It is a movie with a lot of depth but is also quite funny. The Full Monty is set in the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire, England. The movie opens with an expose on Sheffield being a boom town with the steel industry, but 25 years later the steel mill has closed down and the city is suffering from high unemployment. This seems to be a common idea that runs through English television  the bleakness of life and the hopelessness of unemployment. I remember before the last English election when the Conservative Party lost to the Labour Party, that they interviewed people in some of the English towns where unemployment was very high, and the people had simply lost hope. So has it happened in this movie: people have lost hope to the point where they no longer wish to live. But there is hope on the horizon: Gaz and Dave, the main characters, sneak into a female only strip show and realise that these guys are getting paid ten pounds a head to simply take off their cloths. This gives Gaz an idea: he has much more than these guys, and he is willing to go the Full Monty, so why not get involved. So he and Dave get some people together to become male strippers with them. I expected the movie to be about them going on the nightclub circuit, becoming really famous, and then loosing everything: but it is not the case. Rather it is about the relationships between the people and the work the do to get to the strip show at the end. It is about their pride and overcoming it to humiliate themselves in front of a lot of ladies. It is also about how they try to hide this from everybody to save themselves the embarrassment. It seems that hiding things from people is another aspect of this movie. Dave hides the fact that he is becoming a male stripper from his wife, thinking that she is going to deride him because he is over weight. The truth is, she really doesn't care. She don't care if he is overweight: she loves him the way he is and she doesn't care if he goes the full monty. Then there is Dave and Gaz's former foreman. He has been unemployed for six months, yet he is ashamed of it and keeps this from his wife. As such she continues to go obliviously spending as if he were still working. She still has her dreams of going skiing. In the end, when she finds out, her quote is "I can handle the television being reposed, but what I cannot stand is that you kept this from me." This relationship is one on assumptions. The partners assume to much about each other and discover that in the end they really don't know that much about each other at all. The shame of stripping against the shame of being unemployed is what really runs through this movie. There is the bleakness of Job Club and the dole queue, lightened up by the strippers starting to dance to a song playing over the radio. Then there is the shame that they face when they are caught practicing in an abandoned factory. Not only do they face a mocking police force, but also the story hits the front page, and everybody knows. But then, they discovered that this newspaper article is the best advertising they could have got. The Full Monty is much better that I originally expected. It is not simply a movie about male strippers, but about the characters that they are and the struggles that they face trying to find a niche in society. Rather than being a movie that one compromises on when trying to find one at a video store, it should be one that is on the too see list.

    "The Full Monty" is a good-hearted comedy that the cynical nineties were begging for, and its Britain again that surprises the world with something new, fresh, pleasant and that could appeal to the whole family, despite some adult undertones. Overall, despite the adult material (hot) stuff, there is a sweet innocence mixed with the very inspirational message that every average Joe can have chance to do something different and be, a night long, THE big star, applauded and cheered by a crowd of roaring women. It's a celebration of optimism and trust in out deepest fantasies with the touch of realism that the movie needed so we wouldn't forget that these men do it for money, more than recognition. And this is an important element because it keeps the identification process with the protagonist totally intact. The casting is ideal because it shows every range of masculine adult demography, old, young, father, single, with neither racial nor sexual orientations' prejudices, so everyone can relate to them. It's a film that reconciles the public with the idea that men can also be targeted by the evolution of society, consumption society that advertises the image of clean-cut faces and muscular bodies with the same zealous marketing as for women's tits and sexy legs. Average men suffer from a tacit rejection, because basically, every time, their women, or for that matter, the women they'd like to be with, are confronted to messages indirectly shouting: "They are unemployed, ugly, lazy, they are losers". "The Full Monty" is a comedic response to a very serious social issue and the kindheartedness of the film proves that humor sometimes can be the best weapon to deal with rejection. Comedic tones still have these particularities that they're not meant to be taken seriously, but I think what makes the best comedies is precisely the ability to make people laugh and move them at the same time. Even screwball comedies can be exasperating if they don't let you catch your breath and appreciate some sensitivity. And this is the strength of "The Full Monty", being able to tell us very touching separate stories that will all converge to a same need: having a job, making money, being respected. I said 'respected' and not 'admired' because 'admiration' would be taking itself too seriously and the suspension of disbelief wouldn't work. The stories are centered on three men who all used to work in the steel factory which is to Sheffield (England) what the Nuclear Power Plant is to "The Simpsons"' Springfield, before the economical crisis, before unemployment, a problem still relevant today. Robert Carlyle, who played the demented Begbie in "Trainspotting" is in a totally opposite role as the leader of the group, Gaz, who'll encourage his buddies to 'do it', to prove that they're not an endangered species, that they are the real men. Mark Addy is Dave, his best friend, a lovable teddy bear of a guy who doesn't trust his wife, not even himself, he's the kind of character you want to put near you just to show him the film and how people really think about him, he could have been annoying if he didn't have so many qualities, among them, loyalty, kindness and a heart as big as his belly. And Gerald is the older and wiser man, who supervised them in the factory before unemployment. He's the one who practices dance and can help to produce the miracle. Three more men will join the group, and the only one to know about the secret is Nathan, Gaz's son, his inspiration to show that he's better than what her mother, and her new husband say. The film doesn't avoid some stereotypical situations but it would be unfair to criticize that, since the newness relies on the show these guys will do, the Chippendales, and no other movie did that before. And even when Chippendales did it, it wasn't "The Full Monty". And no other movie dealt with male nudity, with sexiness, with "Hot Stuff" in a light-hearted tone. The script is surely one of the movie's main strengths, because the strip-tease aspect is only a plot device, the point is elsewhere, it's about proving value. I won't develop that subject because all I need is to copy-paste everything I said about "Rocky", but there's indeed a "Rocky" feeling in this picture, where the prize to win is respect and self-respect. And this creates a double empathy from male public first, but also women who can finally see their men, boyfriends as the unsung heroes of everyday's life. I loved David with his girl, Jeannie, they were not particularly handsome, but there was a genuine love going between them. Gee, I would have loved to see them after the show, if this movie was 5 minutes longer, just something of the aftermath, but I guess their satisfactions and the cheers of the public had enough eloquence. And let's not forget that this is still a comedy, and the whole preparation of the show lead to so many memorable scenes especially the one in the Agency, where all the guys tap their feet to Donna Summer's iconic rhythm, probably one of the most gimmicky scenes of the 90's, not to mention the hilarious scenes that kept enough class not to reach certain limits. Where other movies would have probably displayed nude images, old women screaming, or other distastefully displays of raunchy humor, "The Full Monty" tackles it with a gentleness, that probably helped the film to reach a wider audience, be a popular success, and nominated to the Oscars. Definitely, one of the best of the 90's!

    Six men who were laid off when their Yorkshire steel mill closed are desperate for money. When a one-night Chippendales show comes to town and is a big hit, they decide to make their own strip show, and to make it more interesting, they'll go completely nude! The men are neither big and buff nor good dancers, but they put their hearts into preparing for the big night. This absolutely charming comedy has many touching moments, thanks to the well-developed and sympathetic characters we come to know: One is a divorced dad (Robert Carlyle) who needs to raise child support money, one is an overweight and depressed husband (Mark Addy), one cares for his aging mum, and one (Tom Wilkinson) hasn't had the nerve to tell his credit card-happy wife that he's been unemployed for six months. All of the actors are perfectly cast and it's worth the price just to see the venerable Wilkinson bump and grind to "Hot Stuff." Gritty location photography and a lively, Oscar-winning disco soundtrack help create the mood of despair giving way to hope. The North country accents and slang are sometimes unintelligible, but that in no way detracts from the fun. This fast-paced and sweet film made with a tiny budget went on to break UK box office records. Highly recommended.

    One of the more infamous British films to cross the Atlantic during the last decade and a half, "The Full Monty" was a monster success in its homeland, and was also successful in the US (and garnered four Oscar nods, including a win for Best Original Score). I'm actually surprised that it did so well. There are some appealing moments found during the 91 minute running time, but overall it's actually kind of dull. It's meant to be a breezy and amiable flick, but for a movie with such low (but earnest) ambitions, it doesn't succeed. Unemployed and out of money, Gaz (Robert Carlyle) is desperate. His son doesn't want to stay with him because his house is too cold, and he's late on his child support payments. His friends are not much better off. Then Gaz sees a Chippendales show (well, more specifically, the tons of ladies who are in the audience). That gives him an idea. If Chippendales dancers can make that much money by hiding the money shot, then think about how much money they could make if they went all the way! The movie is just too low-key to really be anything substantial. Granted, as I said, "The Full Monty" never tries to do anything groundbreaking, but we need something to keep us engaged. Apart from a few nice performances (particularly by Robert Carlyle, who's taken a successful change of pace by playing a nice, earnest guy instead of a creepy psycho), the film doesn't do that. But what really annoyed me is that the whole film is all about them going all the way, but the film doesn't have the guts to to the same. There's very little nudity, and save for one scene, the camera never shows us anything. I'm not saying that the film would have been better had they shown the guys doing "the full monty," but that's an apt description for the film. It lacks courage. Movies that want to be easy going and fancy free need to let everything flow naturally. Seeing as the Brits are among the least antsy about showing sex and nudity on screen, my thinking is that this was edited by the MPAA to avoid an NC-17 rating, or it was filmed that way in the hopes of getting a less strict rating (not that it worked...the film received an undeserved R rating). This isn't a terrible film, but it's just not that great either. My rating: PG-13 for language and brief nudity.

    The Full Monty came out in 1997 with a small four million dollar budget and grossed more than forty million dollars at the US box office and also was nominated for four academy awards including best picture. More than ten years later, it rightfully obtains its cult status. The movie is set in the famous steel making town of Sheffield, England. So once people start loosing their jobs, six unemployed factory workers (Gaz,Gerald, Dave, Nathan Lomper, and Horse) decide to become male strippers, much to the disapproval of their families. Gaz is divorced and wants full custody of his son. Gerald is lying to his wife, telling her that they can go on vacation, but he has no money, and needs the job. Dave is depressed and thinks his wife is cheating on him. Horse is an aging break dancer and wants to be back on top. Lomper is suicidal and needs something to believe in and Nathan is obsessed with Singin' In The Rain. They all decide to perform the full Monty-or completely nude. The story is simple, and feel good, but also rather predictable. But the outcome does not matter when the ride is so much fun. The Full Monty: *** stars

    Ah, The Full Monty - it warms the cockles of your heart and revives your faith in human nature.&nbsp; From the beguiling Yorkshire accents, to the ubiquitous swearing, to the liberal&nbsp; sprinklings of political incorrectness throughout, I defy anyone not love this unassuming, feel-good British comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set in Sheffield in the 80s when unemployment was rife and men were skint, this movie truly catches the spirit of the times while evoking a strange nostalgia for that shared experience of joblessness and economic doom in 80s working class Britain.&nbsp; The Full Monty comprises a motley crew of disaffected and seemingly mismatched men,&nbsp; several of whom lost their jobs in the collapse of the steel industry, and follows their day to day life as they attempt to set up a striptease act to rival the Chippendales (and, of course, earn some ready cash).&nbsp; Main man, Gav (Robert Carlyle) with his weasly face, and exasperated cries of 'foookin' 'ell!' every five minutes is bloody brilliant as is 'fat bastard' Dave (Mark Addy), and pale, suicidal carrot- top, Lomper (Steve Huison).&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as superbly showcasing working class life with all it's social problems, ugliness and pathos, The Full Monty touches on broken relationships, homosexuality and the shame and hardship of long term unemployment.&nbsp; However, the joy of this movie is that despite the struggles of these men and their families, there are no pity fests; life is what it is and you just get on with it.&nbsp; The buoyancy, cheek and unerring spiritedness&nbsp; of the characters&nbsp; keeps you smiling .&nbsp; Dancing in the dole queue, g-strings in the sitting room and cling film in the potting shed, this film's got it all - and the world is a better place for it.

    There are very few films these days that make me laugh out loud but this one managed it six or seven times! Having spent most of my adult life in the north of England, I find the humour in this one quite refreshing. It's not all fun and games though, there is quite a lot of drama to be found here and it's this element that gives the humour more bite. Great performances all round with (for me), Tom Wilkinson standing out, although they were all praiseworthy. Over all, a comedy set against the gritty reality of unemployment and all that brings. If, like me, you've been avoiding this one, don't put it off any longer, you can thank me later! SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.7/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    In the 1970's, Sheffield, England was a booming city that had a very uplifting economy and steel was the hottest staple that came out at that time as a public relations informer told me. By the 1990's came around, due to lack of funding, a lot of the steel mills were sadly foreclosed. Unemployment was on the rise, people had to seek jobs elsewhere and those who have built their reputation in these companies struggled to adapt to either menial jobs or just plain stayed home and just collected welfare checks. Gaz (Robert Carlyle "Once Upon A Time") who's a divorced man lost custody to his teenage son as his wife found another man, who happens to be more financially secure than him. He continues to make sporadic visits on occasion to see his son Nathan (Willian Snape), but goes beyond as he makes Nathan a close companion. Desperate for money, Gaz finds a way he can make a substantial amount of cash. After hearing about a group of male strippers called the Chippendales come to town they seem to make a rather handsome profit in a rented hall that's usually packed. Gaz along with his friend Dave (Mark Addy) believe they could make the same amount by putting on a similar show. The only problem is that the gentlemen they recruit to bare their all are just average looking people, not the same type of prim and dashing individuals that are the Chippendales. And what's even worse is that their dancing skills are even worst than me (which is bad because I'm in theatre). The rest of the ragtag wannabe strippers include a former factory foreman Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), and a drifter named Horse (Paul Barber) who in spite of a bad hip is able to teach them a few moves. What's very curious to me is why in the world would these women be interested in seeing not so good-looking guys take their clothes off after getting much satisfaction from the Chippendales? Gaz suggests that they might get the upper hand if they're brave enough to go the full monty by baring all. The whole idea was trashed from the start as they fear that their bodies just don't have that mass appeal to get ladies the attention as one fears he's too skinny, the other fears he's too obese and the other is just too old to bear all. In all seriousness, "The Full Monty" touches on issues about finding work and that even though it's great and rewarding to have a job, there's always a possibility that the company you work for will not be around forever. And when you lose that job because of foreclosure you feel like everything you have done was all for nought. Sheffield is the primarily example of a once sprawling city where the power balance between men and women were abolished because men in that town were unable to provide for their families. Gerald who has not had a job in six months has been lying to his wife. But when he could no longer provide for his family, his wife wants him to break up. This might have happened in Gaz's situation with his wife before the movie takes off. The film closely links Dave's insecurities is to do anything to avoid becoming jobless. In fact the closest relationship is with Dave and his wife. The cast is entirely British and most people who live on North American soil may not be familiar to this group of relative unknowns. Carlyle is probably best known for his role as Mr. Gold (Rumpelstiltskin) from the TV series "Once Upon a Time", but even though he is the leading performer here, his performance is not the best one here. The real standouts are Addy's Dave and Wilkinson's Gerald. We root for the men not because they're bearing their gifts to the ladies, but because these men are trying to win back their livelihood so they could become more employable. Wilkinson seems to be the most comfortable of the trio, but his opportunities are quite scarce and it shows. Too bad that Paul Barber's Horse doesn't get much airtime. He seemed more energetic of the characters but there was not much story to make him more developed. "The Full Monty" is one of many films to feature the poor state of the British economy In some ways it's a bit of an homage to "Brassed Off". Even the brass band featured in a dire situation in an early scene was just pure irony. But it's still a good comedy and even though it's over-the-top in content, the situation the characters face are real and may reflect that of the situation of the economy we're facing as I speak.

    Sometimes the timing of a film's release is so accidentally perfect that it captures the mood of the public and becomes a hit. Such a film is The Full Monty. Made on a meagre budget of &pound;3 million, this small Sheffield-set comedy-drama went to achieve unprecedented commercial and critical success. It became the highest grossing film to that point at the UK box office; was nominated for the prestigious Best Picture Oscar (losing out to Titanic); and scooped several BAFTAs including Best Film and Best Actor for Robert Carlyle. A fine haul indeed for a modest little production set in a run-down neighbourhood of the steel city. Struggling ex-steelworkers Gaz (Robert Carlyle) and Dave (Mark Addy) spend their days breaking into shut-down steel mills searching for scrap metal to steal and sell. Sometimes they are joined by Gaz's son Nathan (William Snape), his child from a broken relationship with ex-wife Mandy (Emily Woof). One day Gaz notices a number of women entering a local social club and discovers that they are going to watch a male strip show. He hits upon the idea of raising a little money by putting on his own show. Enlisting other unemployed desperadoes like his former manager Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), ex-security guard Lomper (Steve Huison), smooth mover Horse (Paul Barber) and well-endowed hunk Guy (Hugo Speer), the unlikely lotharios set about practising their dance moves and perfecting a raunchy routine. The stakes are upped considerably when some women spot the lads putting up posters to advertise their show. When the women laugh off their ambitious scheme, Gaz decides to up the ante by telling them they will be going "the Full Monty" (fully naked). "Nobody said anything to me about the Full Monty!" gasps Horse, but his protests come too late the word is already out and the guys have a 400-strong audience of baying women to satisfy. In truth, The Full Monty could quite easily have turned up as a feature length TV-style drama - at first glance it certainly isn't an especially cinematic sort of film (e.g. a film that belongs on the big screen). Thanks to Simon Beaufoy's cracking script and the game performances, it transcends its small roots to become a thoroughly enjoyable story indeed. Performances that stand out include Carlyle as the desperate Gaz, Addy as the terribly self-conscious and overweight Dave, and Wilkinson as their once-proud manager, now reduced to teaching a bunch of 'commoners' to dance (as well as joining them in their potentially humiliating enterprise). Most of the performances are strong right down the cast list, but these three are a notch ahead of the rest. The dialogue is often very funny and the grim locations add to the film's sense of social deprivation and desperation. Like most comedies, repeat viewings gradually diminish the film's humour and freshness but first time round it is a vastly entertaining film, successfully managing to generate a feel-good atmosphere within its grimmest of settings. Director Peter Cattaneo never really pushed on after The Full Monty  to date he has only made three other features (none of which match the giddy heights of this one). It's a shame that he hasn't been able to capitalise on such a phenomenally successful debut. As Yorkshire-based cinema goes, The Full Monty is the most successful film ever to have come out of the region. It's also one of the best.

    I am not somebody who has any problems with dirty humor or is too prude to watch a movie with a sexual plot. And yet I am very impressed how they managed to take the storyline about men becoming strippers and produce a movie that is so sweet and in a way innocent. I am even surprised it was R rated. The reason is that we get to know the characters from their vulnerable side. We can see their desperation that drives them to this decision and we can feel their insecurities. I don't want to make it sound as if it is some tear jerker, it is not. In fact it is a very funny movie, but at the same time it has so much humanity. The best scenes in the movie are the auditions and practice scenes. Hilarious. I definitely recommend this movie. It is funny, light hearted and with great acting. But people who have the same problem as me in understanding accents should make sure they have captions on.

    The thing that stands out about this movie is that it seemed to have brought a new phrase into the English language, and that is "going the full monty." Generally it means to take off all of your clothes, but in another way it simply means going all of the way. One thing is true, not many movies can claim to have had an impact on the English language, but this one has. Now, the concept of a movie about male strippers doesn't really appeal to me. One would expect it to be rated R, but it is not. The ratings say that it contains nudity, but for an M rating all you can expect to see is bare bums, and yes that is what you do see. The Full Monty is actually about much more than simple male strippers: it is about self pride, image, unemployment, and simple trust. It is a movie with a lot of depth but is also quite funny. The Full Monty is set in the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire, England. The movie opens with an expose on Sheffield being a boom town with the steel industry, but 25 years later the steel mill has closed down and the city is suffering from high unemployment. This seems to be a common idea that runs through English television  the bleakness of life and the hopelessness of unemployment. I remember before the last English election when the Conservative Party lost to the Labour Party, that they interviewed people in some of the English towns where unemployment was very high, and the people had simply lost hope. So has it happened in this movie: people have lost hope to the point where they no longer wish to live. But there is hope on the horizon: Gaz and Dave, the main characters, sneak into a female only strip show and realise that these guys are getting paid ten pounds a head to simply take off their cloths. This gives Gaz an idea: he has much more than these guys, and he is willing to go the Full Monty, so why not get involved. So he and Dave get some people together to become male strippers with them. I expected the movie to be about them going on the nightclub circuit, becoming really famous, and then loosing everything: but it is not the case. Rather it is about the relationships between the people and the work the do to get to the strip show at the end. It is about their pride and overcoming it to humiliate themselves in front of a lot of ladies. It is also about how they try to hide this from everybody to save themselves the embarrassment. It seems that hiding things from people is another aspect of this movie. Dave hides the fact that he is becoming a male stripper from his wife, thinking that she is going to deride him because he is over weight. The truth is, she really doesn't care. She don't care if he is overweight: she loves him the way he is and she doesn't care if he goes the full monty. Then there is Dave and Gaz's former foreman. He has been unemployed for six months, yet he is ashamed of it and keeps this from his wife. As such she continues to go obliviously spending as if he were still working. She still has her dreams of going skiing. In the end, when she finds out, her quote is "I can handle the television being reposed, but what I cannot stand is that you kept this from me." This relationship is one on assumptions. The partners assume to much about each other and discover that in the end they really don't know that much about each other at all. The shame of stripping against the shame of being unemployed is what really runs through this movie. There is the bleakness of Job Club and the dole queue, lightened up by the strippers starting to dance to a song playing over the radio. Then there is the shame that they face when they are caught practicing in an abandoned factory. Not only do they face a mocking police force, but also the story hits the front page, and everybody knows. But then, they discovered that this newspaper article is the best advertising they could have got. The Full Monty is much better that I originally expected. It is not simply a movie about male strippers, but about the characters that they are and the struggles that they face trying to find a niche in society. Rather than being a movie that one compromises on when trying to find one at a video store, it should be one that is on the too see list.

    "The Full Monty" is a good-hearted comedy that the cynical nineties were begging for, and its Britain again that surprises the world with something new, fresh, pleasant and that could appeal to the whole family, despite some adult undertones. Overall, despite the adult material (hot) stuff, there is a sweet innocence mixed with the very inspirational message that every average Joe can have chance to do something different and be, a night long, THE big star, applauded and cheered by a crowd of roaring women. It's a celebration of optimism and trust in out deepest fantasies with the touch of realism that the movie needed so we wouldn't forget that these men do it for money, more than recognition. And this is an important element because it keeps the identification process with the protagonist totally intact. The casting is ideal because it shows every range of masculine adult demography, old, young, father, single, with neither racial nor sexual orientations' prejudices, so everyone can relate to them. It's a film that reconciles the public with the idea that men can also be targeted by the evolution of society, consumption society that advertises the image of clean-cut faces and muscular bodies with the same zealous marketing as for women's tits and sexy legs. Average men suffer from a tacit rejection, because basically, every time, their women, or for that matter, the women they'd like to be with, are confronted to messages indirectly shouting: "They are unemployed, ugly, lazy, they are losers". "The Full Monty" is a comedic response to a very serious social issue and the kindheartedness of the film proves that humor sometimes can be the best weapon to deal with rejection. Comedic tones still have these particularities that they're not meant to be taken seriously, but I think what makes the best comedies is precisely the ability to make people laugh and move them at the same time. Even screwball comedies can be exasperating if they don't let you catch your breath and appreciate some sensitivity. And this is the strength of "The Full Monty", being able to tell us very touching separate stories that will all converge to a same need: having a job, making money, being respected. I said 'respected' and not 'admired' because 'admiration' would be taking itself too seriously and the suspension of disbelief wouldn't work. The stories are centered on three men who all used to work in the steel factory which is to Sheffield (England) what the Nuclear Power Plant is to "The Simpsons"' Springfield, before the economical crisis, before unemployment, a problem still relevant today. Robert Carlyle, who played the demented Begbie in "Trainspotting" is in a totally opposite role as the leader of the group, Gaz, who'll encourage his buddies to 'do it', to prove that they're not an endangered species, that they are the real men. Mark Addy is Dave, his best friend, a lovable teddy bear of a guy who doesn't trust his wife, not even himself, he's the kind of character you want to put near you just to show him the film and how people really think about him, he could have been annoying if he didn't have so many qualities, among them, loyalty, kindness and a heart as big as his belly. And Gerald is the older and wiser man, who supervised them in the factory before unemployment. He's the one who practices dance and can help to produce the miracle. Three more men will join the group, and the only one to know about the secret is Nathan, Gaz's son, his inspiration to show that he's better than what her mother, and her new husband say. The film doesn't avoid some stereotypical situations but it would be unfair to criticize that, since the newness relies on the show these guys will do, the Chippendales, and no other movie did that before. And even when Chippendales did it, it wasn't "The Full Monty". And no other movie dealt with male nudity, with sexiness, with "Hot Stuff" in a light-hearted tone. The script is surely one of the movie's main strengths, because the strip-tease aspect is only a plot device, the point is elsewhere, it's about proving value. I won't develop that subject because all I need is to copy-paste everything I said about "Rocky", but there's indeed a "Rocky" feeling in this picture, where the prize to win is respect and self-respect. And this creates a double empathy from male public first, but also women who can finally see their men, boyfriends as the unsung heroes of everyday's life. I loved David with his girl, Jeannie, they were not particularly handsome, but there was a genuine love going between them. Gee, I would have loved to see them after the show, if this movie was 5 minutes longer, just something of the aftermath, but I guess their satisfactions and the cheers of the public had enough eloquence. And let's not forget that this is still a comedy, and the whole preparation of the show lead to so many memorable scenes especially the one in the Agency, where all the guys tap their feet to Donna Summer's iconic rhythm, probably one of the most gimmicky scenes of the 90's, not to mention the hilarious scenes that kept enough class not to reach certain limits. Where other movies would have probably displayed nude images, old women screaming, or other distastefully displays of raunchy humor, "The Full Monty" tackles it with a gentleness, that probably helped the film to reach a wider audience, be a popular success, and nominated to the Oscars. Definitely, one of the best of the 90's!

    Six men who were laid off when their Yorkshire steel mill closed are desperate for money. When a one-night Chippendales show comes to town and is a big hit, they decide to make their own strip show, and to make it more interesting, they'll go completely nude! The men are neither big and buff nor good dancers, but they put their hearts into preparing for the big night. This absolutely charming comedy has many touching moments, thanks to the well-developed and sympathetic characters we come to know: One is a divorced dad (Robert Carlyle) who needs to raise child support money, one is an overweight and depressed husband (Mark Addy), one cares for his aging mum, and one (Tom Wilkinson) hasn't had the nerve to tell his credit card-happy wife that he's been unemployed for six months. All of the actors are perfectly cast and it's worth the price just to see the venerable Wilkinson bump and grind to "Hot Stuff." Gritty location photography and a lively, Oscar-winning disco soundtrack help create the mood of despair giving way to hope. The North country accents and slang are sometimes unintelligible, but that in no way detracts from the fun. This fast-paced and sweet film made with a tiny budget went on to break UK box office records. Highly recommended.

    One of the more infamous British films to cross the Atlantic during the last decade and a half, "The Full Monty" was a monster success in its homeland, and was also successful in the US (and garnered four Oscar nods, including a win for Best Original Score). I'm actually surprised that it did so well. There are some appealing moments found during the 91 minute running time, but overall it's actually kind of dull. It's meant to be a breezy and amiable flick, but for a movie with such low (but earnest) ambitions, it doesn't succeed. Unemployed and out of money, Gaz (Robert Carlyle) is desperate. His son doesn't want to stay with him because his house is too cold, and he's late on his child support payments. His friends are not much better off. Then Gaz sees a Chippendales show (well, more specifically, the tons of ladies who are in the audience). That gives him an idea. If Chippendales dancers can make that much money by hiding the money shot, then think about how much money they could make if they went all the way! The movie is just too low-key to really be anything substantial. Granted, as I said, "The Full Monty" never tries to do anything groundbreaking, but we need something to keep us engaged. Apart from a few nice performances (particularly by Robert Carlyle, who's taken a successful change of pace by playing a nice, earnest guy instead of a creepy psycho), the film doesn't do that. But what really annoyed me is that the whole film is all about them going all the way, but the film doesn't have the guts to to the same. There's very little nudity, and save for one scene, the camera never shows us anything. I'm not saying that the film would have been better had they shown the guys doing "the full monty," but that's an apt description for the film. It lacks courage. Movies that want to be easy going and fancy free need to let everything flow naturally. Seeing as the Brits are among the least antsy about showing sex and nudity on screen, my thinking is that this was edited by the MPAA to avoid an NC-17 rating, or it was filmed that way in the hopes of getting a less strict rating (not that it worked...the film received an undeserved R rating). This isn't a terrible film, but it's just not that great either. My rating: PG-13 for language and brief nudity.

    The Full Monty came out in 1997 with a small four million dollar budget and grossed more than forty million dollars at the US box office and also was nominated for four academy awards including best picture. More than ten years later, it rightfully obtains its cult status. The movie is set in the famous steel making town of Sheffield, England. So once people start loosing their jobs, six unemployed factory workers (Gaz,Gerald, Dave, Nathan Lomper, and Horse) decide to become male strippers, much to the disapproval of their families. Gaz is divorced and wants full custody of his son. Gerald is lying to his wife, telling her that they can go on vacation, but he has no money, and needs the job. Dave is depressed and thinks his wife is cheating on him. Horse is an aging break dancer and wants to be back on top. Lomper is suicidal and needs something to believe in and Nathan is obsessed with Singin' In The Rain. They all decide to perform the full Monty-or completely nude. The story is simple, and feel good, but also rather predictable. But the outcome does not matter when the ride is so much fun. The Full Monty: *** stars

    In the 1970's, Sheffield, England was a booming city that had a very uplifting economy and steel was the hottest staple that came out at that time as a public relations informer told me. By the 1990's came around, due to lack of funding, a lot of the steel mills were sadly foreclosed. Unemployment was on the rise, people had to seek jobs elsewhere and those who have built their reputation in these companies struggled to adapt to either menial jobs or just plain stayed home and just collected welfare checks. Gaz (Robert Carlyle "Once Upon A Time") who's a divorced man lost custody to his teenage son as his wife found another man, who happens to be more financially secure than him. He continues to make sporadic visits on occasion to see his son Nathan (Willian Snape), but goes beyond as he makes Nathan a close companion. Desperate for money, Gaz finds a way he can make a substantial amount of cash. After hearing about a group of male strippers called the Chippendales come to town they seem to make a rather handsome profit in a rented hall that's usually packed. Gaz along with his friend Dave (Mark Addy) believe they could make the same amount by putting on a similar show. The only problem is that the gentlemen they recruit to bare their all are just average looking people, not the same type of prim and dashing individuals that are the Chippendales. And what's even worse is that their dancing skills are even worst than me (which is bad because I'm in theatre). The rest of the ragtag wannabe strippers include a former factory foreman Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), and a drifter named Horse (Paul Barber) who in spite of a bad hip is able to teach them a few moves. What's very curious to me is why in the world would these women be interested in seeing not so good-looking guys take their clothes off after getting much satisfaction from the Chippendales? Gaz suggests that they might get the upper hand if they're brave enough to go the full monty by baring all. The whole idea was trashed from the start as they fear that their bodies just don't have that mass appeal to get ladies the attention as one fears he's too skinny, the other fears he's too obese and the other is just too old to bear all. In all seriousness, "The Full Monty" touches on issues about finding work and that even though it's great and rewarding to have a job, there's always a possibility that the company you work for will not be around forever. And when you lose that job because of foreclosure you feel like everything you have done was all for nought. Sheffield is the primarily example of a once sprawling city where the power balance between men and women were abolished because men in that town were unable to provide for their families. Gerald who has not had a job in six months has been lying to his wife. But when he could no longer provide for his family, his wife wants him to break up. This might have happened in Gaz's situation with his wife before the movie takes off. The film closely links Dave's insecurities is to do anything to avoid becoming jobless. In fact the closest relationship is with Dave and his wife. The cast is entirely British and most people who live on North American soil may not be familiar to this group of relative unknowns. Carlyle is probably best known for his role as Mr. Gold (Rumpelstiltskin) from the TV series "Once Upon a Time", but even though he is the leading performer here, his performance is not the best one here. The real standouts are Addy's Dave and Wilkinson's Gerald. We root for the men not because they're bearing their gifts to the ladies, but because these men are trying to win back their livelihood so they could become more employable. Wilkinson seems to be the most comfortable of the trio, but his opportunities are quite scarce and it shows. Too bad that Paul Barber's Horse doesn't get much airtime. He seemed more energetic of the characters but there was not much story to make him more developed. "The Full Monty" is one of many films to feature the poor state of the British economy In some ways it's a bit of an homage to "Brassed Off". Even the brass band featured in a dire situation in an early scene was just pure irony. But it's still a good comedy and even though it's over-the-top in content, the situation the characters face are real and may reflect that of the situation of the economy we're facing as I speak.

    Sometimes the timing of a film's release is so accidentally perfect that it captures the mood of the public and becomes a hit. Such a film is The Full Monty. Made on a meagre budget of &pound;3 million, this small Sheffield-set comedy-drama went to achieve unprecedented commercial and critical success. It became the highest grossing film to that point at the UK box office; was nominated for the prestigious Best Picture Oscar (losing out to Titanic); and scooped several BAFTAs including Best Film and Best Actor for Robert Carlyle. A fine haul indeed for a modest little production set in a run-down neighbourhood of the steel city. Struggling ex-steelworkers Gaz (Robert Carlyle) and Dave (Mark Addy) spend their days breaking into shut-down steel mills searching for scrap metal to steal and sell. Sometimes they are joined by Gaz's son Nathan (William Snape), his child from a broken relationship with ex-wife Mandy (Emily Woof). One day Gaz notices a number of women entering a local social club and discovers that they are going to watch a male strip show. He hits upon the idea of raising a little money by putting on his own show. Enlisting other unemployed desperadoes like his former manager Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), ex-security guard Lomper (Steve Huison), smooth mover Horse (Paul Barber) and well-endowed hunk Guy (Hugo Speer), the unlikely lotharios set about practising their dance moves and perfecting a raunchy routine. The stakes are upped considerably when some women spot the lads putting up posters to advertise their show. When the women laugh off their ambitious scheme, Gaz decides to up the ante by telling them they will be going "the Full Monty" (fully naked). "Nobody said anything to me about the Full Monty!" gasps Horse, but his protests come too late the word is already out and the guys have a 400-strong audience of baying women to satisfy. In truth, The Full Monty could quite easily have turned up as a feature length TV-style drama - at first glance it certainly isn't an especially cinematic sort of film (e.g. a film that belongs on the big screen). Thanks to Simon Beaufoy's cracking script and the game performances, it transcends its small roots to become a thoroughly enjoyable story indeed. Performances that stand out include Carlyle as the desperate Gaz, Addy as the terribly self-conscious and overweight Dave, and Wilkinson as their once-proud manager, now reduced to teaching a bunch of 'commoners' to dance (as well as joining them in their potentially humiliating enterprise). Most of the performances are strong right down the cast list, but these three are a notch ahead of the rest. The dialogue is often very funny and the grim locations add to the film's sense of social deprivation and desperation. Like most comedies, repeat viewings gradually diminish the film's humour and freshness but first time round it is a vastly entertaining film, successfully managing to generate a feel-good atmosphere within its grimmest of settings. Director Peter Cattaneo never really pushed on after The Full Monty  to date he has only made three other features (none of which match the giddy heights of this one). It's a shame that he hasn't been able to capitalise on such a phenomenally successful debut. As Yorkshire-based cinema goes, The Full Monty is the most successful film ever to have come out of the region. It's also one of the best.

    I am not somebody who has any problems with dirty humor or is too prude to watch a movie with a sexual plot. And yet I am very impressed how they managed to take the storyline about men becoming strippers and produce a movie that is so sweet and in a way innocent. I am even surprised it was R rated. The reason is that we get to know the characters from their vulnerable side. We can see their desperation that drives them to this decision and we can feel their insecurities. I don't want to make it sound as if it is some tear jerker, it is not. In fact it is a very funny movie, but at the same time it has so much humanity. The best scenes in the movie are the auditions and practice scenes. Hilarious. I definitely recommend this movie. It is funny, light hearted and with great acting. But people who have the same problem as me in understanding accents should make sure they have captions on.

    The thing that stands out about this movie is that it seemed to have brought a new phrase into the English language, and that is "going the full monty." Generally it means to take off all of your clothes, but in another way it simply means going all of the way. One thing is true, not many movies can claim to have had an impact on the English language, but this one has. Now, the concept of a movie about male strippers doesn't really appeal to me. One would expect it to be rated R, but it is not. The ratings say that it contains nudity, but for an M rating all you can expect to see is bare bums, and yes that is what you do see. The Full Monty is actually about much more than simple male strippers: it is about self pride, image, unemployment, and simple trust. It is a movie with a lot of depth but is also quite funny. The Full Monty is set in the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire, England. The movie opens with an expose on Sheffield being a boom town with the steel industry, but 25 years later the steel mill has closed down and the city is suffering from high unemployment. This seems to be a common idea that runs through English television  the bleakness of life and the hopelessness of unemployment. I remember before the last English election when the Conservative Party lost to the Labour Party, that they interviewed people in some of the English towns where unemployment was very high, and the people had simply lost hope. So has it happened in this movie: people have lost hope to the point where they no longer wish to live. But there is hope on the horizon: Gaz and Dave, the main characters, sneak into a female only strip show and realise that these guys are getting paid ten pounds a head to simply take off their cloths. This gives Gaz an idea: he has much more than these guys, and he is willing to go the Full Monty, so why not get involved. So he and Dave get some people together to become male strippers with them. I expected the movie to be about them going on the nightclub circuit, becoming really famous, and then loosing everything: but it is not the case. Rather it is about the relationships between the people and the work the do to get to the strip show at the end. It is about their pride and overcoming it to humiliate themselves in front of a lot of ladies. It is also about how they try to hide this from everybody to save themselves the embarrassment. It seems that hiding things from people is another aspect of this movie. Dave hides the fact that he is becoming a male stripper from his wife, thinking that she is going to deride him because he is over weight. The truth is, she really doesn't care. She don't care if he is overweight: she loves him the way he is and she doesn't care if he goes the full monty. Then there is Dave and Gaz's former foreman. He has been unemployed for six months, yet he is ashamed of it and keeps this from his wife. As such she continues to go obliviously spending as if he were still working. She still has her dreams of going skiing. In the end, when she finds out, her quote is "I can handle the television being reposed, but what I cannot stand is that you kept this from me." This relationship is one on assumptions. The partners assume to much about each other and discover that in the end they really don't know that much about each other at all. The shame of stripping against the shame of being unemployed is what really runs through this movie. There is the bleakness of Job Club and the dole queue, lightened up by the strippers starting to dance to a song playing over the radio. Then there is the shame that they face when they are caught practicing in an abandoned factory. Not only do they face a mocking police force, but also the story hits the front page, and everybody knows. But then, they discovered that this newspaper article is the best advertising they could have got. The Full Monty is much better that I originally expected. It is not simply a movie about male strippers, but about the characters that they are and the struggles that they face trying to find a niche in society. Rather than being a movie that one compromises on when trying to find one at a video store, it should be one that is on the too see list.

    "The Full Monty" is a good-hearted comedy that the cynical nineties were begging for, and its Britain again that surprises the world with something new, fresh, pleasant and that could appeal to the whole family, despite some adult undertones. Overall, despite the adult material (hot) stuff, there is a sweet innocence mixed with the very inspirational message that every average Joe can have chance to do something different and be, a night long, THE big star, applauded and cheered by a crowd of roaring women. It's a celebration of optimism and trust in out deepest fantasies with the touch of realism that the movie needed so we wouldn't forget that these men do it for money, more than recognition. And this is an important element because it keeps the identification process with the protagonist totally intact. The casting is ideal because it shows every range of masculine adult demography, old, young, father, single, with neither racial nor sexual orientations' prejudices, so everyone can relate to them. It's a film that reconciles the public with the idea that men can also be targeted by the evolution of society, consumption society that advertises the image of clean-cut faces and muscular bodies with the same zealous marketing as for women's tits and sexy legs. Average men suffer from a tacit rejection, because basically, every time, their women, or for that matter, the women they'd like to be with, are confronted to messages indirectly shouting: "They are unemployed, ugly, lazy, they are losers". "The Full Monty" is a comedic response to a very serious social issue and the kindheartedness of the film proves that humor sometimes can be the best weapon to deal with rejection. Comedic tones still have these particularities that they're not meant to be taken seriously, but I think what makes the best comedies is precisely the ability to make people laugh and move them at the same time. Even screwball comedies can be exasperating if they don't let you catch your breath and appreciate some sensitivity. And this is the strength of "The Full Monty", being able to tell us very touching separate stories that will all converge to a same need: having a job, making money, being respected. I said 'respected' and not 'admired' because 'admiration' would be taking itself too seriously and the suspension of disbelief wouldn't work. The stories are centered on three men who all used to work in the steel factory which is to Sheffield (England) what the Nuclear Power Plant is to "The Simpsons"' Springfield, before the economical crisis, before unemployment, a problem still relevant today. Robert Carlyle, who played the demented Begbie in "Trainspotting" is in a totally opposite role as the leader of the group, Gaz, who'll encourage his buddies to 'do it', to prove that they're not an endangered species, that they are the real men. Mark Addy is Dave, his best friend, a lovable teddy bear of a guy who doesn't trust his wife, not even himself, he's the kind of character you want to put near you just to show him the film and how people really think about him, he could have been annoying if he didn't have so many qualities, among them, loyalty, kindness and a heart as big as his belly. And Gerald is the older and wiser man, who supervised them in the factory before unemployment. He's the one who practices dance and can help to produce the miracle. Three more men will join the group, and the only one to know about the secret is Nathan, Gaz's son, his inspiration to show that he's better than what her mother, and her new husband say. The film doesn't avoid some stereotypical situations but it would be unfair to criticize that, since the newness relies on the show these guys will do, the Chippendales, and no other movie did that before. And even when Chippendales did it, it wasn't "The Full Monty". And no other movie dealt with male nudity, with sexiness, with "Hot Stuff" in a light-hearted tone. The script is surely one of the movie's main strengths, because the strip-tease aspect is only a plot device, the point is elsewhere, it's about proving value. I won't develop that subject because all I need is to copy-paste everything I said about "Rocky", but there's indeed a "Rocky" feeling in this picture, where the prize to win is respect and self-respect. And this creates a double empathy from male public first, but also women who can finally see their men, boyfriends as the unsung heroes of everyday's life. I loved David with his girl, Jeannie, they were not particularly handsome, but there was a genuine love going between them. Gee, I would have loved to see them after the show, if this movie was 5 minutes longer, just something of the aftermath, but I guess their satisfactions and the cheers of the public had enough eloquence. And let's not forget that this is still a comedy, and the whole preparation of the show lead to so many memorable scenes especially the one in the Agency, where all the guys tap their feet to Donna Summer's iconic rhythm, probably one of the most gimmicky scenes of the 90's, not to mention the hilarious scenes that kept enough class not to reach certain limits. Where other movies would have probably displayed nude images, old women screaming, or other distastefully displays of raunchy humor, "The Full Monty" tackles it with a gentleness, that probably helped the film to reach a wider audience, be a popular success, and nominated to the Oscars. Definitely, one of the best of the 90's!

    Six men who were laid off when their Yorkshire steel mill closed are desperate for money. When a one-night Chippendales show comes to town and is a big hit, they decide to make their own strip show, and to make it more interesting, they'll go completely nude! The men are neither big and buff nor good dancers, but they put their hearts into preparing for the big night. This absolutely charming comedy has many touching moments, thanks to the well-developed and sympathetic characters we come to know: One is a divorced dad (Robert Carlyle) who needs to raise child support money, one is an overweight and depressed husband (Mark Addy), one cares for his aging mum, and one (Tom Wilkinson) hasn't had the nerve to tell his credit card-happy wife that he's been unemployed for six months. All of the actors are perfectly cast and it's worth the price just to see the venerable Wilkinson bump and grind to "Hot Stuff." Gritty location photography and a lively, Oscar-winning disco soundtrack help create the mood of despair giving way to hope. The North country accents and slang are sometimes unintelligible, but that in no way detracts from the fun. This fast-paced and sweet film made with a tiny budget went on to break UK box office records. Highly recommended.

    One of the more infamous British films to cross the Atlantic during the last decade and a half, "The Full Monty" was a monster success in its homeland, and was also successful in the US (and garnered four Oscar nods, including a win for Best Original Score). I'm actually surprised that it did so well. There are some appealing moments found during the 91 minute running time, but overall it's actually kind of dull. It's meant to be a breezy and amiable flick, but for a movie with such low (but earnest) ambitions, it doesn't succeed. Unemployed and out of money, Gaz (Robert Carlyle) is desperate. His son doesn't want to stay with him because his house is too cold, and he's late on his child support payments. His friends are not much better off. Then Gaz sees a Chippendales show (well, more specifically, the tons of ladies who are in the audience). That gives him an idea. If Chippendales dancers can make that much money by hiding the money shot, then think about how much money they could make if they went all the way! The movie is just too low-key to really be anything substantial. Granted, as I said, "The Full Monty" never tries to do anything groundbreaking, but we need something to keep us engaged. Apart from a few nice performances (particularly by Robert Carlyle, who's taken a successful change of pace by playing a nice, earnest guy instead of a creepy psycho), the film doesn't do that. But what really annoyed me is that the whole film is all about them going all the way, but the film doesn't have the guts to to the same. There's very little nudity, and save for one scene, the camera never shows us anything. I'm not saying that the film would have been better had they shown the guys doing "the full monty," but that's an apt description for the film. It lacks courage. Movies that want to be easy going and fancy free need to let everything flow naturally. Seeing as the Brits are among the least antsy about showing sex and nudity on screen, my thinking is that this was edited by the MPAA to avoid an NC-17 rating, or it was filmed that way in the hopes of getting a less strict rating (not that it worked...the film received an undeserved R rating). This isn't a terrible film, but it's just not that great either. My rating: PG-13 for language and brief nudity.

    The Full Monty came out in 1997 with a small four million dollar budget and grossed more than forty million dollars at the US box office and also was nominated for four academy awards including best picture. More than ten years later, it rightfully obtains its cult status. The movie is set in the famous steel making town of Sheffield, England. So once people start loosing their jobs, six unemployed factory workers (Gaz,Gerald, Dave, Nathan Lomper, and Horse) decide to become male strippers, much to the disapproval of their families. Gaz is divorced and wants full custody of his son. Gerald is lying to his wife, telling her that they can go on vacation, but he has no money, and needs the job. Dave is depressed and thinks his wife is cheating on him. Horse is an aging break dancer and wants to be back on top. Lomper is suicidal and needs something to believe in and Nathan is obsessed with Singin' In The Rain. They all decide to perform the full Monty-or completely nude. The story is simple, and feel good, but also rather predictable. But the outcome does not matter when the ride is so much fun. The Full Monty: *** stars

    Ah, The Full Monty - it warms the cockles of your heart and revives your faith in human nature.&nbsp; From the beguiling Yorkshire accents, to the ubiquitous swearing, to the liberal&nbsp; sprinklings of political incorrectness throughout, I defy anyone not love this unassuming, feel-good British comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set in Sheffield in the 80s when unemployment was rife and men were skint, this movie truly catches the spirit of the times while evoking a strange nostalgia for that shared experience of joblessness and economic doom in 80s working class Britain.&nbsp; The Full Monty comprises a motley crew of disaffected and seemingly mismatched men,&nbsp; several of whom lost their jobs in the collapse of the steel industry, and follows their day to day life as they attempt to set up a striptease act to rival the Chippendales (and, of course, earn some ready cash).&nbsp; Main man, Gav (Robert Carlyle) with his weasly face, and exasperated cries of 'foookin' 'ell!' every five minutes is bloody brilliant as is 'fat bastard' Dave (Mark Addy), and pale, suicidal carrot- top, Lomper (Steve Huison).&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as superbly showcasing working class life with all it's social problems, ugliness and pathos, The Full Monty touches on broken relationships, homosexuality and the shame and hardship of long term unemployment.&nbsp; However, the joy of this movie is that despite the struggles of these men and their families, there are no pity fests; life is what it is and you just get on with it.&nbsp; The buoyancy, cheek and unerring spiritedness&nbsp; of the characters&nbsp; keeps you smiling .&nbsp; Dancing in the dole queue, g-strings in the sitting room and cling film in the potting shed, this film's got it all - and the world is a better place for it.

    There are very few films these days that make me laugh out loud but this one managed it six or seven times! Having spent most of my adult life in the north of England, I find the humour in this one quite refreshing. It's not all fun and games though, there is quite a lot of drama to be found here and it's this element that gives the humour more bite. Great performances all round with (for me), Tom Wilkinson standing out, although they were all praiseworthy. Over all, a comedy set against the gritty reality of unemployment and all that brings. If, like me, you've been avoiding this one, don't put it off any longer, you can thank me later! SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.7/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    In the 1970's, Sheffield, England was a booming city that had a very uplifting economy and steel was the hottest staple that came out at that time as a public relations informer told me. By the 1990's came around, due to lack of funding, a lot of the steel mills were sadly foreclosed. Unemployment was on the rise, people had to seek jobs elsewhere and those who have built their reputation in these companies struggled to adapt to either menial jobs or just plain stayed home and just collected welfare checks. Gaz (Robert Carlyle "Once Upon A Time") who's a divorced man lost custody to his teenage son as his wife found another man, who happens to be more financially secure than him. He continues to make sporadic visits on occasion to see his son Nathan (Willian Snape), but goes beyond as he makes Nathan a close companion. Desperate for money, Gaz finds a way he can make a substantial amount of cash. After hearing about a group of male strippers called the Chippendales come to town they seem to make a rather handsome profit in a rented hall that's usually packed. Gaz along with his friend Dave (Mark Addy) believe they could make the same amount by putting on a similar show. The only problem is that the gentlemen they recruit to bare their all are just average looking people, not the same type of prim and dashing individuals that are the Chippendales. And what's even worse is that their dancing skills are even worst than me (which is bad because I'm in theatre). The rest of the ragtag wannabe strippers include a former factory foreman Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), and a drifter named Horse (Paul Barber) who in spite of a bad hip is able to teach them a few moves. What's very curious to me is why in the world would these women be interested in seeing not so good-looking guys take their clothes off after getting much satisfaction from the Chippendales? Gaz suggests that they might get the upper hand if they're brave enough to go the full monty by baring all. The whole idea was trashed from the start as they fear that their bodies just don't have that mass appeal to get ladies the attention as one fears he's too skinny, the other fears he's too obese and the other is just too old to bear all. In all seriousness, "The Full Monty" touches on issues about finding work and that even though it's great and rewarding to have a job, there's always a possibility that the company you work for will not be around forever. And when you lose that job because of foreclosure you feel like everything you have done was all for nought. Sheffield is the primarily example of a once sprawling city where the power balance between men and women were abolished because men in that town were unable to provide for their families. Gerald who has not had a job in six months has been lying to his wife. But when he could no longer provide for his family, his wife wants him to break up. This might have happened in Gaz's situation with his wife before the movie takes off. The film closely links Dave's insecurities is to do anything to avoid becoming jobless. In fact the closest relationship is with Dave and his wife. The cast is entirely British and most people who live on North American soil may not be familiar to this group of relative unknowns. Carlyle is probably best known for his role as Mr. Gold (Rumpelstiltskin) from the TV series "Once Upon a Time", but even though he is the leading performer here, his performance is not the best one here. The real standouts are Addy's Dave and Wilkinson's Gerald. We root for the men not because they're bearing their gifts to the ladies, but because these men are trying to win back their livelihood so they could become more employable. Wilkinson seems to be the most comfortable of the trio, but his opportunities are quite scarce and it shows. Too bad that Paul Barber's Horse doesn't get much airtime. He seemed more energetic of the characters but there was not much story to make him more developed. "The Full Monty" is one of many films to feature the poor state of the British economy In some ways it's a bit of an homage to "Brassed Off". Even the brass band featured in a dire situation in an early scene was just pure irony. But it's still a good comedy and even though it's over-the-top in content, the situation the characters face are real and may reflect that of the situation of the economy we're facing as I speak.

    Sometimes the timing of a film's release is so accidentally perfect that it captures the mood of the public and becomes a hit. Such a film is The Full Monty. Made on a meagre budget of &pound;3 million, this small Sheffield-set comedy-drama went to achieve unprecedented commercial and critical success. It became the highest grossing film to that point at the UK box office; was nominated for the prestigious Best Picture Oscar (losing out to Titanic); and scooped several BAFTAs including Best Film and Best Actor for Robert Carlyle. A fine haul indeed for a modest little production set in a run-down neighbourhood of the steel city. Struggling ex-steelworkers Gaz (Robert Carlyle) and Dave (Mark Addy) spend their days breaking into shut-down steel mills searching for scrap metal to steal and sell. Sometimes they are joined by Gaz's son Nathan (William Snape), his child from a broken relationship with ex-wife Mandy (Emily Woof). One day Gaz notices a number of women entering a local social club and discovers that they are going to watch a male strip show. He hits upon the idea of raising a little money by putting on his own show. Enlisting other unemployed desperadoes like his former manager Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), ex-security guard Lomper (Steve Huison), smooth mover Horse (Paul Barber) and well-endowed hunk Guy (Hugo Speer), the unlikely lotharios set about practising their dance moves and perfecting a raunchy routine. The stakes are upped considerably when some women spot the lads putting up posters to advertise their show. When the women laugh off their ambitious scheme, Gaz decides to up the ante by telling them they will be going "the Full Monty" (fully naked). "Nobody said anything to me about the Full Monty!" gasps Horse, but his protests come too late the word is already out and the guys have a 400-strong audience of baying women to satisfy. In truth, The Full Monty could quite easily have turned up as a feature length TV-style drama - at first glance it certainly isn't an especially cinematic sort of film (e.g. a film that belongs on the big screen). Thanks to Simon Beaufoy's cracking script and the game performances, it transcends its small roots to become a thoroughly enjoyable story indeed. Performances that stand out include Carlyle as the desperate Gaz, Addy as the terribly self-conscious and overweight Dave, and Wilkinson as their once-proud manager, now reduced to teaching a bunch of 'commoners' to dance (as well as joining them in their potentially humiliating enterprise). Most of the performances are strong right down the cast list, but these three are a notch ahead of the rest. The dialogue is often very funny and the grim locations add to the film's sense of social deprivation and desperation. Like most comedies, repeat viewings gradually diminish the film's humour and freshness but first time round it is a vastly entertaining film, successfully managing to generate a feel-good atmosphere within its grimmest of settings. Director Peter Cattaneo never really pushed on after The Full Monty  to date he has only made three other features (none of which match the giddy heights of this one). It's a shame that he hasn't been able to capitalise on such a phenomenally successful debut. As Yorkshire-based cinema goes, The Full Monty is the most successful film ever to have come out of the region. It's also one of the best.

    I am not somebody who has any problems with dirty humor or is too prude to watch a movie with a sexual plot. And yet I am very impressed how they managed to take the storyline about men becoming strippers and produce a movie that is so sweet and in a way innocent. I am even surprised it was R rated. The reason is that we get to know the characters from their vulnerable side. We can see their desperation that drives them to this decision and we can feel their insecurities. I don't want to make it sound as if it is some tear jerker, it is not. In fact it is a very funny movie, but at the same time it has so much humanity. The best scenes in the movie are the auditions and practice scenes. Hilarious. I definitely recommend this movie. It is funny, light hearted and with great acting. But people who have the same problem as me in understanding accents should make sure they have captions on.

    The thing that stands out about this movie is that it seemed to have brought a new phrase into the English language, and that is "going the full monty." Generally it means to take off all of your clothes, but in another way it simply means going all of the way. One thing is true, not many movies can claim to have had an impact on the English language, but this one has. Now, the concept of a movie about male strippers doesn't really appeal to me. One would expect it to be rated R, but it is not. The ratings say that it contains nudity, but for an M rating all you can expect to see is bare bums, and yes that is what you do see. The Full Monty is actually about much more than simple male strippers: it is about self pride, image, unemployment, and simple trust. It is a movie with a lot of depth but is also quite funny. The Full Monty is set in the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire, England. The movie opens with an expose on Sheffield being a boom town with the steel industry, but 25 years later the steel mill has closed down and the city is suffering from high unemployment. This seems to be a common idea that runs through English television  the bleakness of life and the hopelessness of unemployment. I remember before the last English election when the Conservative Party lost to the Labour Party, that they interviewed people in some of the English towns where unemployment was very high, and the people had simply lost hope. So has it happened in this movie: people have lost hope to the point where they no longer wish to live. But there is hope on the horizon: Gaz and Dave, the main characters, sneak into a female only strip show and realise that these guys are getting paid ten pounds a head to simply take off their cloths. This gives Gaz an idea: he has much more than these guys, and he is willing to go the Full Monty, so why not get involved. So he and Dave get some people together to become male strippers with them. I expected the movie to be about them going on the nightclub circuit, becoming really famous, and then loosing everything: but it is not the case. Rather it is about the relationships between the people and the work the do to get to the strip show at the end. It is about their pride and overcoming it to humiliate themselves in front of a lot of ladies. It is also about how they try to hide this from everybody to save themselves the embarrassment. It seems that hiding things from people is another aspect of this movie. Dave hides the fact that he is becoming a male stripper from his wife, thinking that she is going to deride him because he is over weight. The truth is, she really doesn't care. She don't care if he is overweight: she loves him the way he is and she doesn't care if he goes the full monty. Then there is Dave and Gaz's former foreman. He has been unemployed for six months, yet he is ashamed of it and keeps this from his wife. As such she continues to go obliviously spending as if he were still working. She still has her dreams of going skiing. In the end, when she finds out, her quote is "I can handle the television being reposed, but what I cannot stand is that you kept this from me." This relationship is one on assumptions. The partners assume to much about each other and discover that in the end they really don't know that much about each other at all. The shame of stripping against the shame of being unemployed is what really runs through this movie. There is the bleakness of Job Club and the dole queue, lightened up by the strippers starting to dance to a song playing over the radio. Then there is the shame that they face when they are caught practicing in an abandoned factory. Not only do they face a mocking police force, but also the story hits the front page, and everybody knows. But then, they discovered that this newspaper article is the best advertising they could have got. The Full Monty is much better that I originally expected. It is not simply a movie about male strippers, but about the characters that they are and the struggles that they face trying to find a niche in society. Rather than being a movie that one compromises on when trying to find one at a video store, it should be one that is on the too see list.

    "The Full Monty" is a good-hearted comedy that the cynical nineties were begging for, and its Britain again that surprises the world with something new, fresh, pleasant and that could appeal to the whole family, despite some adult undertones. Overall, despite the adult material (hot) stuff, there is a sweet innocence mixed with the very inspirational message that every average Joe can have chance to do something different and be, a night long, THE big star, applauded and cheered by a crowd of roaring women. It's a celebration of optimism and trust in out deepest fantasies with the touch of realism that the movie needed so we wouldn't forget that these men do it for money, more than recognition. And this is an important element because it keeps the identification process with the protagonist totally intact. The casting is ideal because it shows every range of masculine adult demography, old, young, father, single, with neither racial nor sexual orientations' prejudices, so everyone can relate to them. It's a film that reconciles the public with the idea that men can also be targeted by the evolution of society, consumption society that advertises the image of clean-cut faces and muscular bodies with the same zealous marketing as for women's tits and sexy legs. Average men suffer from a tacit rejection, because basically, every time, their women, or for that matter, the women they'd like to be with, are confronted to messages indirectly shouting: "They are unemployed, ugly, lazy, they are losers". "The Full Monty" is a comedic response to a very serious social issue and the kindheartedness of the film proves that humor sometimes can be the best weapon to deal with rejection. Comedic tones still have these particularities that they're not meant to be taken seriously, but I think what makes the best comedies is precisely the ability to make people laugh and move them at the same time. Even screwball comedies can be exasperating if they don't let you catch your breath and appreciate some sensitivity. And this is the strength of "The Full Monty", being able to tell us very touching separate stories that will all converge to a same need: having a job, making money, being respected. I said 'respected' and not 'admired' because 'admiration' would be taking itself too seriously and the suspension of disbelief wouldn't work. The stories are centered on three men who all used to work in the steel factory which is to Sheffield (England) what the Nuclear Power Plant is to "The Simpsons"' Springfield, before the economical crisis, before unemployment, a problem still relevant today. Robert Carlyle, who played the demented Begbie in "Trainspotting" is in a totally opposite role as the leader of the group, Gaz, who'll encourage his buddies to 'do it', to prove that they're not an endangered species, that they are the real men. Mark Addy is Dave, his best friend, a lovable teddy bear of a guy who doesn't trust his wife, not even himself, he's the kind of character you want to put near you just to show him the film and how people really think about him, he could have been annoying if he didn't have so many qualities, among them, loyalty, kindness and a heart as big as his belly. And Gerald is the older and wiser man, who supervised them in the factory before unemployment. He's the one who practices dance and can help to produce the miracle. Three more men will join the group, and the only one to know about the secret is Nathan, Gaz's son, his inspiration to show that he's better than what her mother, and her new husband say. The film doesn't avoid some stereotypical situations but it would be unfair to criticize that, since the newness relies on the show these guys will do, the Chippendales, and no other movie did that before. And even when Chippendales did it, it wasn't "The Full Monty". And no other movie dealt with male nudity, with sexiness, with "Hot Stuff" in a light-hearted tone. The script is surely one of the movie's main strengths, because the strip-tease aspect is only a plot device, the point is elsewhere, it's about proving value. I won't develop that subject because all I need is to copy-paste everything I said about "Rocky", but there's indeed a "Rocky" feeling in this picture, where the prize to win is respect and self-respect. And this creates a double empathy from male public first, but also women who can finally see their men, boyfriends as the unsung heroes of everyday's life. I loved David with his girl, Jeannie, they were not particularly handsome, but there was a genuine love going between them. Gee, I would have loved to see them after the show, if this movie was 5 minutes longer, just something of the aftermath, but I guess their satisfactions and the cheers of the public had enough eloquence. And let's not forget that this is still a comedy, and the whole preparation of the show lead to so many memorable scenes especially the one in the Agency, where all the guys tap their feet to Donna Summer's iconic rhythm, probably one of the most gimmicky scenes of the 90's, not to mention the hilarious scenes that kept enough class not to reach certain limits. Where other movies would have probably displayed nude images, old women screaming, or other distastefully displays of raunchy humor, "The Full Monty" tackles it with a gentleness, that probably helped the film to reach a wider audience, be a popular success, and nominated to the Oscars. Definitely, one of the best of the 90's!

    Six men who were laid off when their Yorkshire steel mill closed are desperate for money. When a one-night Chippendales show comes to town and is a big hit, they decide to make their own strip show, and to make it more interesting, they'll go completely nude! The men are neither big and buff nor good dancers, but they put their hearts into preparing for the big night. This absolutely charming comedy has many touching moments, thanks to the well-developed and sympathetic characters we come to know: One is a divorced dad (Robert Carlyle) who needs to raise child support money, one is an overweight and depressed husband (Mark Addy), one cares for his aging mum, and one (Tom Wilkinson) hasn't had the nerve to tell his credit card-happy wife that he's been unemployed for six months. All of the actors are perfectly cast and it's worth the price just to see the venerable Wilkinson bump and grind to "Hot Stuff." Gritty location photography and a lively, Oscar-winning disco soundtrack help create the mood of despair giving way to hope. The North country accents and slang are sometimes unintelligible, but that in no way detracts from the fun. This fast-paced and sweet film made with a tiny budget went on to break UK box office records. Highly recommended.

    One of the more infamous British films to cross the Atlantic during the last decade and a half, "The Full Monty" was a monster success in its homeland, and was also successful in the US (and garnered four Oscar nods, including a win for Best Original Score). I'm actually surprised that it did so well. There are some appealing moments found during the 91 minute running time, but overall it's actually kind of dull. It's meant to be a breezy and amiable flick, but for a movie with such low (but earnest) ambitions, it doesn't succeed. Unemployed and out of money, Gaz (Robert Carlyle) is desperate. His son doesn't want to stay with him because his house is too cold, and he's late on his child support payments. His friends are not much better off. Then Gaz sees a Chippendales show (well, more specifically, the tons of ladies who are in the audience). That gives him an idea. If Chippendales dancers can make that much money by hiding the money shot, then think about how much money they could make if they went all the way! The movie is just too low-key to really be anything substantial. Granted, as I said, "The Full Monty" never tries to do anything groundbreaking, but we need something to keep us engaged. Apart from a few nice performances (particularly by Robert Carlyle, who's taken a successful change of pace by playing a nice, earnest guy instead of a creepy psycho), the film doesn't do that. But what really annoyed me is that the whole film is all about them going all the way, but the film doesn't have the guts to to the same. There's very little nudity, and save for one scene, the camera never shows us anything. I'm not saying that the film would have been better had they shown the guys doing "the full monty," but that's an apt description for the film. It lacks courage. Movies that want to be easy going and fancy free need to let everything flow naturally. Seeing as the Brits are among the least antsy about showing sex and nudity on screen, my thinking is that this was edited by the MPAA to avoid an NC-17 rating, or it was filmed that way in the hopes of getting a less strict rating (not that it worked...the film received an undeserved R rating). This isn't a terrible film, but it's just not that great either. My rating: PG-13 for language and brief nudity.

    The Full Monty came out in 1997 with a small four million dollar budget and grossed more than forty million dollars at the US box office and also was nominated for four academy awards including best picture. More than ten years later, it rightfully obtains its cult status. The movie is set in the famous steel making town of Sheffield, England. So once people start loosing their jobs, six unemployed factory workers (Gaz,Gerald, Dave, Nathan Lomper, and Horse) decide to become male strippers, much to the disapproval of their families. Gaz is divorced and wants full custody of his son. Gerald is lying to his wife, telling her that they can go on vacation, but he has no money, and needs the job. Dave is depressed and thinks his wife is cheating on him. Horse is an aging break dancer and wants to be back on top. Lomper is suicidal and needs something to believe in and Nathan is obsessed with Singin' In The Rain. They all decide to perform the full Monty-or completely nude. The story is simple, and feel good, but also rather predictable. But the outcome does not matter when the ride is so much fun. The Full Monty: *** stars

    Ah, The Full Monty - it warms the cockles of your heart and revives your faith in human nature.&nbsp; From the beguiling Yorkshire accents, to the ubiquitous swearing, to the liberal&nbsp; sprinklings of political incorrectness throughout, I defy anyone not love this unassuming, feel-good British comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set in Sheffield in the 80s when unemployment was rife and men were skint, this movie truly catches the spirit of the times while evoking a strange nostalgia for that shared experience of joblessness and economic doom in 80s working class Britain.&nbsp; The Full Monty comprises a motley crew of disaffected and seemingly mismatched men,&nbsp; several of whom lost their jobs in the collapse of the steel industry, and follows their day to day life as they attempt to set up a striptease act to rival the Chippendales (and, of course, earn some ready cash).&nbsp; Main man, Gav (Robert Carlyle) with his weasly face, and exasperated cries of 'foookin' 'ell!' every five minutes is bloody brilliant as is 'fat bastard' Dave (Mark Addy), and pale, suicidal carrot- top, Lomper (Steve Huison).&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as superbly showcasing working class life with all it's social problems, ugliness and pathos, The Full Monty touches on broken relationships, homosexuality and the shame and hardship of long term unemployment.&nbsp; However, the joy of this movie is that despite the struggles of these men and their families, there are no pity fests; life is what it is and you just get on with it.&nbsp; The buoyancy, cheek and unerring spiritedness&nbsp; of the characters&nbsp; keeps you smiling .&nbsp; Dancing in the dole queue, g-strings in the sitting room and cling film in the potting shed, this film's got it all - and the world is a better place for it.

    There are very few films these days that make me laugh out loud but this one managed it six or seven times! Having spent most of my adult life in the north of England, I find the humour in this one quite refreshing. It's not all fun and games though, there is quite a lot of drama to be found here and it's this element that gives the humour more bite. Great performances all round with (for me), Tom Wilkinson standing out, although they were all praiseworthy. Over all, a comedy set against the gritty reality of unemployment and all that brings. If, like me, you've been avoiding this one, don't put it off any longer, you can thank me later! SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.7/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    In the 1970's, Sheffield, England was a booming city that had a very uplifting economy and steel was the hottest staple that came out at that time as a public relations informer told me. By the 1990's came around, due to lack of funding, a lot of the steel mills were sadly foreclosed. Unemployment was on the rise, people had to seek jobs elsewhere and those who have built their reputation in these companies struggled to adapt to either menial jobs or just plain stayed home and just collected welfare checks. Gaz (Robert Carlyle "Once Upon A Time") who's a divorced man lost custody to his teenage son as his wife found another man, who happens to be more financially secure than him. He continues to make sporadic visits on occasion to see his son Nathan (Willian Snape), but goes beyond as he makes Nathan a close companion. Desperate for money, Gaz finds a way he can make a substantial amount of cash. After hearing about a group of male strippers called the Chippendales come to town they seem to make a rather handsome profit in a rented hall that's usually packed. Gaz along with his friend Dave (Mark Addy) believe they could make the same amount by putting on a similar show. The only problem is that the gentlemen they recruit to bare their all are just average looking people, not the same type of prim and dashing individuals that are the Chippendales. And what's even worse is that their dancing skills are even worst than me (which is bad because I'm in theatre). The rest of the ragtag wannabe strippers include a former factory foreman Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), and a drifter named Horse (Paul Barber) who in spite of a bad hip is able to teach them a few moves. What's very curious to me is why in the world would these women be interested in seeing not so good-looking guys take their clothes off after getting much satisfaction from the Chippendales? Gaz suggests that they might get the upper hand if they're brave enough to go the full monty by baring all. The whole idea was trashed from the start as they fear that their bodies just don't have that mass appeal to get ladies the attention as one fears he's too skinny, the other fears he's too obese and the other is just too old to bear all. In all seriousness, "The Full Monty" touches on issues about finding work and that even though it's great and rewarding to have a job, there's always a possibility that the company you work for will not be around forever. And when you lose that job because of foreclosure you feel like everything you have done was all for nought. Sheffield is the primarily example of a once sprawling city where the power balance between men and women were abolished because men in that town were unable to provide for their families. Gerald who has not had a job in six months has been lying to his wife. But when he could no longer provide for his family, his wife wants him to break up. This might have happened in Gaz's situation with his wife before the movie takes off. The film closely links Dave's insecurities is to do anything to avoid becoming jobless. In fact the closest relationship is with Dave and his wife. The cast is entirely British and most people who live on North American soil may not be familiar to this group of relative unknowns. Carlyle is probably best known for his role as Mr. Gold (Rumpelstiltskin) from the TV series "Once Upon a Time", but even though he is the leading performer here, his performance is not the best one here. The real standouts are Addy's Dave and Wilkinson's Gerald. We root for the men not because they're bearing their gifts to the ladies, but because these men are trying to win back their livelihood so they could become more employable. Wilkinson seems to be the most comfortable of the trio, but his opportunities are quite scarce and it shows. Too bad that Paul Barber's Horse doesn't get much airtime. He seemed more energetic of the characters but there was not much story to make him more developed. "The Full Monty" is one of many films to feature the poor state of the British economy In some ways it's a bit of an homage to "Brassed Off". Even the brass band featured in a dire situation in an early scene was just pure irony. But it's still a good comedy and even though it's over-the-top in content, the situation the characters face are real and may reflect that of the situation of the economy we're facing as I speak.

    Sometimes the timing of a film's release is so accidentally perfect that it captures the mood of the public and becomes a hit. Such a film is The Full Monty. Made on a meagre budget of &pound;3 million, this small Sheffield-set comedy-drama went to achieve unprecedented commercial and critical success. It became the highest grossing film to that point at the UK box office; was nominated for the prestigious Best Picture Oscar (losing out to Titanic); and scooped several BAFTAs including Best Film and Best Actor for Robert Carlyle. A fine haul indeed for a modest little production set in a run-down neighbourhood of the steel city. Struggling ex-steelworkers Gaz (Robert Carlyle) and Dave (Mark Addy) spend their days breaking into shut-down steel mills searching for scrap metal to steal and sell. Sometimes they are joined by Gaz's son Nathan (William Snape), his child from a broken relationship with ex-wife Mandy (Emily Woof). One day Gaz notices a number of women entering a local social club and discovers that they are going to watch a male strip show. He hits upon the idea of raising a little money by putting on his own show. Enlisting other unemployed desperadoes like his former manager Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), ex-security guard Lomper (Steve Huison), smooth mover Horse (Paul Barber) and well-endowed hunk Guy (Hugo Speer), the unlikely lotharios set about practising their dance moves and perfecting a raunchy routine. The stakes are upped considerably when some women spot the lads putting up posters to advertise their show. When the women laugh off their ambitious scheme, Gaz decides to up the ante by telling them they will be going "the Full Monty" (fully naked). "Nobody said anything to me about the Full Monty!" gasps Horse, but his protests come too late the word is already out and the guys have a 400-strong audience of baying women to satisfy. In truth, The Full Monty could quite easily have turned up as a feature length TV-style drama - at first glance it certainly isn't an especially cinematic sort of film (e.g. a film that belongs on the big screen). Thanks to Simon Beaufoy's cracking script and the game performances, it transcends its small roots to become a thoroughly enjoyable story indeed. Performances that stand out include Carlyle as the desperate Gaz, Addy as the terribly self-conscious and overweight Dave, and Wilkinson as their once-proud manager, now reduced to teaching a bunch of 'commoners' to dance (as well as joining them in their potentially humiliating enterprise). Most of the performances are strong right down the cast list, but these three are a notch ahead of the rest. The dialogue is often very funny and the grim locations add to the film's sense of social deprivation and desperation. Like most comedies, repeat viewings gradually diminish the film's humour and freshness but first time round it is a vastly entertaining film, successfully managing to generate a feel-good atmosphere within its grimmest of settings. Director Peter Cattaneo never really pushed on after The Full Monty  to date he has only made three other features (none of which match the giddy heights of this one). It's a shame that he hasn't been able to capitalise on such a phenomenally successful debut. As Yorkshire-based cinema goes, The Full Monty is the most successful film ever to have come out of the region. It's also one of the best.

    The thing that stands out about this movie is that it seemed to have brought a new phrase into the English language, and that is "going the full monty." Generally it means to take off all of your clothes, but in another way it simply means going all of the way. One thing is true, not many movies can claim to have had an impact on the English language, but this one has. Now, the concept of a movie about male strippers doesn't really appeal to me. One would expect it to be rated R, but it is not. The ratings say that it contains nudity, but for an M rating all you can expect to see is bare bums, and yes that is what you do see. The Full Monty is actually about much more than simple male strippers: it is about self pride, image, unemployment, and simple trust. It is a movie with a lot of depth but is also quite funny. The Full Monty is set in the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire, England. The movie opens with an expose on Sheffield being a boom town with the steel industry, but 25 years later the steel mill has closed down and the city is suffering from high unemployment. This seems to be a common idea that runs through English television  the bleakness of life and the hopelessness of unemployment. I remember before the last English election when the Conservative Party lost to the Labour Party, that they interviewed people in some of the English towns where unemployment was very high, and the people had simply lost hope. So has it happened in this movie: people have lost hope to the point where they no longer wish to live. But there is hope on the horizon: Gaz and Dave, the main characters, sneak into a female only strip show and realise that these guys are getting paid ten pounds a head to simply take off their cloths. This gives Gaz an idea: he has much more than these guys, and he is willing to go the Full Monty, so why not get involved. So he and Dave get some people together to become male strippers with them. I expected the movie to be about them going on the nightclub circuit, becoming really famous, and then loosing everything: but it is not the case. Rather it is about the relationships between the people and the work the do to get to the strip show at the end. It is about their pride and overcoming it to humiliate themselves in front of a lot of ladies. It is also about how they try to hide this from everybody to save themselves the embarrassment. It seems that hiding things from people is another aspect of this movie. Dave hides the fact that he is becoming a male stripper from his wife, thinking that she is going to deride him because he is over weight. The truth is, she really doesn't care. She don't care if he is overweight: she loves him the way he is and she doesn't care if he goes the full monty. Then there is Dave and Gaz's former foreman. He has been unemployed for six months, yet he is ashamed of it and keeps this from his wife. As such she continues to go obliviously spending as if he were still working. She still has her dreams of going skiing. In the end, when she finds out, her quote is "I can handle the television being reposed, but what I cannot stand is that you kept this from me." This relationship is one on assumptions. The partners assume to much about each other and discover that in the end they really don't know that much about each other at all. The shame of stripping against the shame of being unemployed is what really runs through this movie. There is the bleakness of Job Club and the dole queue, lightened up by the strippers starting to dance to a song playing over the radio. Then there is the shame that they face when they are caught practicing in an abandoned factory. Not only do they face a mocking police force, but also the story hits the front page, and everybody knows. But then, they discovered that this newspaper article is the best advertising they could have got. The Full Monty is much better that I originally expected. It is not simply a movie about male strippers, but about the characters that they are and the struggles that they face trying to find a niche in society. Rather than being a movie that one compromises on when trying to find one at a video store, it should be one that is on the too see list.

    "The Full Monty" is a good-hearted comedy that the cynical nineties were begging for, and its Britain again that surprises the world with something new, fresh, pleasant and that could appeal to the whole family, despite some adult undertones. Overall, despite the adult material (hot) stuff, there is a sweet innocence mixed with the very inspirational message that every average Joe can have chance to do something different and be, a night long, THE big star, applauded and cheered by a crowd of roaring women. It's a celebration of optimism and trust in out deepest fantasies with the touch of realism that the movie needed so we wouldn't forget that these men do it for money, more than recognition. And this is an important element because it keeps the identification process with the protagonist totally intact. The casting is ideal because it shows every range of masculine adult demography, old, young, father, single, with neither racial nor sexual orientations' prejudices, so everyone can relate to them. It's a film that reconciles the public with the idea that men can also be targeted by the evolution of society, consumption society that advertises the image of clean-cut faces and muscular bodies with the same zealous marketing as for women's tits and sexy legs. Average men suffer from a tacit rejection, because basically, every time, their women, or for that matter, the women they'd like to be with, are confronted to messages indirectly shouting: "They are unemployed, ugly, lazy, they are losers". "The Full Monty" is a comedic response to a very serious social issue and the kindheartedness of the film proves that humor sometimes can be the best weapon to deal with rejection. Comedic tones still have these particularities that they're not meant to be taken seriously, but I think what makes the best comedies is precisely the ability to make people laugh and move them at the same time. Even screwball comedies can be exasperating if they don't let you catch your breath and appreciate some sensitivity. And this is the strength of "The Full Monty", being able to tell us very touching separate stories that will all converge to a same need: having a job, making money, being respected. I said 'respected' and not 'admired' because 'admiration' would be taking itself too seriously and the suspension of disbelief wouldn't work. The stories are centered on three men who all used to work in the steel factory which is to Sheffield (England) what the Nuclear Power Plant is to "The Simpsons"' Springfield, before the economical crisis, before unemployment, a problem still relevant today. Robert Carlyle, who played the demented Begbie in "Trainspotting" is in a totally opposite role as the leader of the group, Gaz, who'll encourage his buddies to 'do it', to prove that they're not an endangered species, that they are the real men. Mark Addy is Dave, his best friend, a lovable teddy bear of a guy who doesn't trust his wife, not even himself, he's the kind of character you want to put near you just to show him the film and how people really think about him, he could have been annoying if he didn't have so many qualities, among them, loyalty, kindness and a heart as big as his belly. And Gerald is the older and wiser man, who supervised them in the factory before unemployment. He's the one who practices dance and can help to produce the miracle. Three more men will join the group, and the only one to know about the secret is Nathan, Gaz's son, his inspiration to show that he's better than what her mother, and her new husband say. The film doesn't avoid some stereotypical situations but it would be unfair to criticize that, since the newness relies on the show these guys will do, the Chippendales, and no other movie did that before. And even when Chippendales did it, it wasn't "The Full Monty". And no other movie dealt with male nudity, with sexiness, with "Hot Stuff" in a light-hearted tone. The script is surely one of the movie's main strengths, because the strip-tease aspect is only a plot device, the point is elsewhere, it's about proving value. I won't develop that subject because all I need is to copy-paste everything I said about "Rocky", but there's indeed a "Rocky" feeling in this picture, where the prize to win is respect and self-respect. And this creates a double empathy from male public first, but also women who can finally see their men, boyfriends as the unsung heroes of everyday's life. I loved David with his girl, Jeannie, they were not particularly handsome, but there was a genuine love going between them. Gee, I would have loved to see them after the show, if this movie was 5 minutes longer, just something of the aftermath, but I guess their satisfactions and the cheers of the public had enough eloquence. And let's not forget that this is still a comedy, and the whole preparation of the show lead to so many memorable scenes especially the one in the Agency, where all the guys tap their feet to Donna Summer's iconic rhythm, probably one of the most gimmicky scenes of the 90's, not to mention the hilarious scenes that kept enough class not to reach certain limits. Where other movies would have probably displayed nude images, old women screaming, or other distastefully displays of raunchy humor, "The Full Monty" tackles it with a gentleness, that probably helped the film to reach a wider audience, be a popular success, and nominated to the Oscars. Definitely, one of the best of the 90's!

    Six men who were laid off when their Yorkshire steel mill closed are desperate for money. When a one-night Chippendales show comes to town and is a big hit, they decide to make their own strip show, and to make it more interesting, they'll go completely nude! The men are neither big and buff nor good dancers, but they put their hearts into preparing for the big night. This absolutely charming comedy has many touching moments, thanks to the well-developed and sympathetic characters we come to know: One is a divorced dad (Robert Carlyle) who needs to raise child support money, one is an overweight and depressed husband (Mark Addy), one cares for his aging mum, and one (Tom Wilkinson) hasn't had the nerve to tell his credit card-happy wife that he's been unemployed for six months. All of the actors are perfectly cast and it's worth the price just to see the venerable Wilkinson bump and grind to "Hot Stuff." Gritty location photography and a lively, Oscar-winning disco soundtrack help create the mood of despair giving way to hope. The North country accents and slang are sometimes unintelligible, but that in no way detracts from the fun. This fast-paced and sweet film made with a tiny budget went on to break UK box office records. Highly recommended.

    One of the more infamous British films to cross the Atlantic during the last decade and a half, "The Full Monty" was a monster success in its homeland, and was also successful in the US (and garnered four Oscar nods, including a win for Best Original Score). I'm actually surprised that it did so well. There are some appealing moments found during the 91 minute running time, but overall it's actually kind of dull. It's meant to be a breezy and amiable flick, but for a movie with such low (but earnest) ambitions, it doesn't succeed. Unemployed and out of money, Gaz (Robert Carlyle) is desperate. His son doesn't want to stay with him because his house is too cold, and he's late on his child support payments. His friends are not much better off. Then Gaz sees a Chippendales show (well, more specifically, the tons of ladies who are in the audience). That gives him an idea. If Chippendales dancers can make that much money by hiding the money shot, then think about how much money they could make if they went all the way! The movie is just too low-key to really be anything substantial. Granted, as I said, "The Full Monty" never tries to do anything groundbreaking, but we need something to keep us engaged. Apart from a few nice performances (particularly by Robert Carlyle, who's taken a successful change of pace by playing a nice, earnest guy instead of a creepy psycho), the film doesn't do that. But what really annoyed me is that the whole film is all about them going all the way, but the film doesn't have the guts to to the same. There's very little nudity, and save for one scene, the camera never shows us anything. I'm not saying that the film would have been better had they shown the guys doing "the full monty," but that's an apt description for the film. It lacks courage. Movies that want to be easy going and fancy free need to let everything flow naturally. Seeing as the Brits are among the least antsy about showing sex and nudity on screen, my thinking is that this was edited by the MPAA to avoid an NC-17 rating, or it was filmed that way in the hopes of getting a less strict rating (not that it worked...the film received an undeserved R rating). This isn't a terrible film, but it's just not that great either. My rating: PG-13 for language and brief nudity.

    The Full Monty came out in 1997 with a small four million dollar budget and grossed more than forty million dollars at the US box office and also was nominated for four academy awards including best picture. More than ten years later, it rightfully obtains its cult status. The movie is set in the famous steel making town of Sheffield, England. So once people start loosing their jobs, six unemployed factory workers (Gaz,Gerald, Dave, Nathan Lomper, and Horse) decide to become male strippers, much to the disapproval of their families. Gaz is divorced and wants full custody of his son. Gerald is lying to his wife, telling her that they can go on vacation, but he has no money, and needs the job. Dave is depressed and thinks his wife is cheating on him. Horse is an aging break dancer and wants to be back on top. Lomper is suicidal and needs something to believe in and Nathan is obsessed with Singin' In The Rain. They all decide to perform the full Monty-or completely nude. The story is simple, and feel good, but also rather predictable. But the outcome does not matter when the ride is so much fun. The Full Monty: *** stars

    Ah, The Full Monty - it warms the cockles of your heart and revives your faith in human nature.&nbsp; From the beguiling Yorkshire accents, to the ubiquitous swearing, to the liberal&nbsp; sprinklings of political incorrectness throughout, I defy anyone not love this unassuming, feel-good British comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set in Sheffield in the 80s when unemployment was rife and men were skint, this movie truly catches the spirit of the times while evoking a strange nostalgia for that shared experience of joblessness and economic doom in 80s working class Britain.&nbsp; The Full Monty comprises a motley crew of disaffected and seemingly mismatched men,&nbsp; several of whom lost their jobs in the collapse of the steel industry, and follows their day to day life as they attempt to set up a striptease act to rival the Chippendales (and, of course, earn some ready cash).&nbsp; Main man, Gav (Robert Carlyle) with his weasly face, and exasperated cries of 'foookin' 'ell!' every five minutes is bloody brilliant as is 'fat bastard' Dave (Mark Addy), and pale, suicidal carrot- top, Lomper (Steve Huison).&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as superbly showcasing working class life with all it's social problems, ugliness and pathos, The Full Monty touches on broken relationships, homosexuality and the shame and hardship of long term unemployment.&nbsp; However, the joy of this movie is that despite the struggles of these men and their families, there are no pity fests; life is what it is and you just get on with it.&nbsp; The buoyancy, cheek and unerring spiritedness&nbsp; of the characters&nbsp; keeps you smiling .&nbsp; Dancing in the dole queue, g-strings in the sitting room and cling film in the potting shed, this film's got it all - and the world is a better place for it.

    There are very few films these days that make me laugh out loud but this one managed it six or seven times! Having spent most of my adult life in the north of England, I find the humour in this one quite refreshing. It's not all fun and games though, there is quite a lot of drama to be found here and it's this element that gives the humour more bite. Great performances all round with (for me), Tom Wilkinson standing out, although they were all praiseworthy. Over all, a comedy set against the gritty reality of unemployment and all that brings. If, like me, you've been avoiding this one, don't put it off any longer, you can thank me later! SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.7/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    In the 1970's, Sheffield, England was a booming city that had a very uplifting economy and steel was the hottest staple that came out at that time as a public relations informer told me. By the 1990's came around, due to lack of funding, a lot of the steel mills were sadly foreclosed. Unemployment was on the rise, people had to seek jobs elsewhere and those who have built their reputation in these companies struggled to adapt to either menial jobs or just plain stayed home and just collected welfare checks. Gaz (Robert Carlyle "Once Upon A Time") who's a divorced man lost custody to his teenage son as his wife found another man, who happens to be more financially secure than him. He continues to make sporadic visits on occasion to see his son Nathan (Willian Snape), but goes beyond as he makes Nathan a close companion. Desperate for money, Gaz finds a way he can make a substantial amount of cash. After hearing about a group of male strippers called the Chippendales come to town they seem to make a rather handsome profit in a rented hall that's usually packed. Gaz along with his friend Dave (Mark Addy) believe they could make the same amount by putting on a similar show. The only problem is that the gentlemen they recruit to bare their all are just average looking people, not the same type of prim and dashing individuals that are the Chippendales. And what's even worse is that their dancing skills are even worst than me (which is bad because I'm in theatre). The rest of the ragtag wannabe strippers include a former factory foreman Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), and a drifter named Horse (Paul Barber) who in spite of a bad hip is able to teach them a few moves. What's very curious to me is why in the world would these women be interested in seeing not so good-looking guys take their clothes off after getting much satisfaction from the Chippendales? Gaz suggests that they might get the upper hand if they're brave enough to go the full monty by baring all. The whole idea was trashed from the start as they fear that their bodies just don't have that mass appeal to get ladies the attention as one fears he's too skinny, the other fears he's too obese and the other is just too old to bear all. In all seriousness, "The Full Monty" touches on issues about finding work and that even though it's great and rewarding to have a job, there's always a possibility that the company you work for will not be around forever. And when you lose that job because of foreclosure you feel like everything you have done was all for nought. Sheffield is the primarily example of a once sprawling city where the power balance between men and women were abolished because men in that town were unable to provide for their families. Gerald who has not had a job in six months has been lying to his wife. But when he could no longer provide for his family, his wife wants him to break up. This might have happened in Gaz's situation with his wife before the movie takes off. The film closely links Dave's insecurities is to do anything to avoid becoming jobless. In fact the closest relationship is with Dave and his wife. The cast is entirely British and most people who live on North American soil may not be familiar to this group of relative unknowns. Carlyle is probably best known for his role as Mr. Gold (Rumpelstiltskin) from the TV series "Once Upon a Time", but even though he is the leading performer here, his performance is not the best one here. The real standouts are Addy's Dave and Wilkinson's Gerald. We root for the men not because they're bearing their gifts to the ladies, but because these men are trying to win back their livelihood so they could become more employable. Wilkinson seems to be the most comfortable of the trio, but his opportunities are quite scarce and it shows. Too bad that Paul Barber's Horse doesn't get much airtime. He seemed more energetic of the characters but there was not much story to make him more developed. "The Full Monty" is one of many films to feature the poor state of the British economy In some ways it's a bit of an homage to "Brassed Off". Even the brass band featured in a dire situation in an early scene was just pure irony. But it's still a good comedy and even though it's over-the-top in content, the situation the characters face are real and may reflect that of the situation of the economy we're facing as I speak.

    Sometimes the timing of a film's release is so accidentally perfect that it captures the mood of the public and becomes a hit. Such a film is The Full Monty. Made on a meagre budget of &pound;3 million, this small Sheffield-set comedy-drama went to achieve unprecedented commercial and critical success. It became the highest grossing film to that point at the UK box office; was nominated for the prestigious Best Picture Oscar (losing out to Titanic); and scooped several BAFTAs including Best Film and Best Actor for Robert Carlyle. A fine haul indeed for a modest little production set in a run-down neighbourhood of the steel city. Struggling ex-steelworkers Gaz (Robert Carlyle) and Dave (Mark Addy) spend their days breaking into shut-down steel mills searching for scrap metal to steal and sell. Sometimes they are joined by Gaz's son Nathan (William Snape), his child from a broken relationship with ex-wife Mandy (Emily Woof). One day Gaz notices a number of women entering a local social club and discovers that they are going to watch a male strip show. He hits upon the idea of raising a little money by putting on his own show. Enlisting other unemployed desperadoes like his former manager Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), ex-security guard Lomper (Steve Huison), smooth mover Horse (Paul Barber) and well-endowed hunk Guy (Hugo Speer), the unlikely lotharios set about practising their dance moves and perfecting a raunchy routine. The stakes are upped considerably when some women spot the lads putting up posters to advertise their show. When the women laugh off their ambitious scheme, Gaz decides to up the ante by telling them they will be going "the Full Monty" (fully naked). "Nobody said anything to me about the Full Monty!" gasps Horse, but his protests come too late the word is already out and the guys have a 400-strong audience of baying women to satisfy. In truth, The Full Monty could quite easily have turned up as a feature length TV-style drama - at first glance it certainly isn't an especially cinematic sort of film (e.g. a film that belongs on the big screen). Thanks to Simon Beaufoy's cracking script and the game performances, it transcends its small roots to become a thoroughly enjoyable story indeed. Performances that stand out include Carlyle as the desperate Gaz, Addy as the terribly self-conscious and overweight Dave, and Wilkinson as their once-proud manager, now reduced to teaching a bunch of 'commoners' to dance (as well as joining them in their potentially humiliating enterprise). Most of the performances are strong right down the cast list, but these three are a notch ahead of the rest. The dialogue is often very funny and the grim locations add to the film's sense of social deprivation and desperation. Like most comedies, repeat viewings gradually diminish the film's humour and freshness but first time round it is a vastly entertaining film, successfully managing to generate a feel-good atmosphere within its grimmest of settings. Director Peter Cattaneo never really pushed on after The Full Monty  to date he has only made three other features (none of which match the giddy heights of this one). It's a shame that he hasn't been able to capitalise on such a phenomenally successful debut. As Yorkshire-based cinema goes, The Full Monty is the most successful film ever to have come out of the region. It's also one of the best.

    I am not somebody who has any problems with dirty humor or is too prude to watch a movie with a sexual plot. And yet I am very impressed how they managed to take the storyline about men becoming strippers and produce a movie that is so sweet and in a way innocent. I am even surprised it was R rated. The reason is that we get to know the characters from their vulnerable side. We can see their desperation that drives them to this decision and we can feel their insecurities. I don't want to make it sound as if it is some tear jerker, it is not. In fact it is a very funny movie, but at the same time it has so much humanity. The best scenes in the movie are the auditions and practice scenes. Hilarious. I definitely recommend this movie. It is funny, light hearted and with great acting. But people who have the same problem as me in understanding accents should make sure they have captions on.

    The thing that stands out about this movie is that it seemed to have brought a new phrase into the English language, and that is "going the full monty." Generally it means to take off all of your clothes, but in another way it simply means going all of the way. One thing is true, not many movies can claim to have had an impact on the English language, but this one has. Now, the concept of a movie about male strippers doesn't really appeal to me. One would expect it to be rated R, but it is not. The ratings say that it contains nudity, but for an M rating all you can expect to see is bare bums, and yes that is what you do see. The Full Monty is actually about much more than simple male strippers: it is about self pride, image, unemployment, and simple trust. It is a movie with a lot of depth but is also quite funny. The Full Monty is set in the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire, England. The movie opens with an expose on Sheffield being a boom town with the steel industry, but 25 years later the steel mill has closed down and the city is suffering from high unemployment. This seems to be a common idea that runs through English television  the bleakness of life and the hopelessness of unemployment. I remember before the last English election when the Conservative Party lost to the Labour Party, that they interviewed people in some of the English towns where unemployment was very high, and the people had simply lost hope. So has it happened in this movie: people have lost hope to the point where they no longer wish to live. But there is hope on the horizon: Gaz and Dave, the main characters, sneak into a female only strip show and realise that these guys are getting paid ten pounds a head to simply take off their cloths. This gives Gaz an idea: he has much more than these guys, and he is willing to go the Full Monty, so why not get involved. So he and Dave get some people together to become male strippers with them. I expected the movie to be about them going on the nightclub circuit, becoming really famous, and then loosing everything: but it is not the case. Rather it is about the relationships between the people and the work the do to get to the strip show at the end. It is about their pride and overcoming it to humiliate themselves in front of a lot of ladies. It is also about how they try to hide this from everybody to save themselves the embarrassment. It seems that hiding things from people is another aspect of this movie. Dave hides the fact that he is becoming a male stripper from his wife, thinking that she is going to deride him because he is over weight. The truth is, she really doesn't care. She don't care if he is overweight: she loves him the way he is and she doesn't care if he goes the full monty. Then there is Dave and Gaz's former foreman. He has been unemployed for six months, yet he is ashamed of it and keeps this from his wife. As such she continues to go obliviously spending as if he were still working. She still has her dreams of going skiing. In the end, when she finds out, her quote is "I can handle the television being reposed, but what I cannot stand is that you kept this from me." This relationship is one on assumptions. The partners assume to much about each other and discover that in the end they really don't know that much about each other at all. The shame of stripping against the shame of being unemployed is what really runs through this movie. There is the bleakness of Job Club and the dole queue, lightened up by the strippers starting to dance to a song playing over the radio. Then there is the shame that they face when they are caught practicing in an abandoned factory. Not only do they face a mocking police force, but also the story hits the front page, and everybody knows. But then, they discovered that this newspaper article is the best advertising they could have got. The Full Monty is much better that I originally expected. It is not simply a movie about male strippers, but about the characters that they are and the struggles that they face trying to find a niche in society. Rather than being a movie that one compromises on when trying to find one at a video store, it should be one that is on the too see list.

"The Full Monty" is a comedic response to a very serious social issue and the kindheartedness of the film proves that humor sometimes can be the best weapon to deal with rejection. Comedic tones still have these particularities that they're not meant to be taken seriously, but I think what makes the best comedies is precisely the ability to make people laugh and move them at the same time. Even screwball comedies can be exasperating if they don't let you catch your breath and appreciate some sensitivity. And this is the strength of "The Full Monty", being able to tell us very touching separate stories that will all converge to a same need: having a job, making money, being respected. I said 'respected' and not 'admired' because 'admiration' would be taking itself too seriously and the suspension of disbelief wouldn't work. The stories are centered on three men who all used to work in the steel factory which is to Sheffield (England) what the Nuclear Power Plant is to "The Simpsons"' Springfield, before the economical crisis, before unemployment, a problem still relevant today. Robert Carlyle, who played the demented Begbie in "Trainspotting" is in a totally opposite role as the leader of the group, Gaz, who'll encourage his buddies to 'do it', to prove that they're not an endangered species, that they are the real men. Mark Addy is Dave, his best friend, a lovable teddy bear of a guy who doesn't trust his wife, not even himself, he's the kind of character you want to put near you just to show him the film and how people really think about him, he could have been annoying if he didn't have so many qualities, among them, loyalty, kindness and a heart as big as his belly. And Gerald is the older and wiser man, who supervised them in the factory before unemployment. He's the one who practices dance and can help to produce the miracle. Three more men will join the group, and the only one to know about the secret is Nathan, Gaz's son, his inspiration to show that he's better than what her mother, and her new husband say. The film doesn't avoid some stereotypical situations but it would be unfair to criticize that, since the newness relies on the show these guys will do, the Chippendales, and no other movie did that before. And even when Chippendales did it, it wasn't "The Full Monty". And no other movie dealt with male nudity, with sexiness, with "Hot Stuff" in a light-hearted tone. The script is surely one of the movie's main strengths, because the strip-tease aspect is only a plot device, the point is elsewhere, it's about proving value. I won't develop that subject because all I need is to copy-paste everything I said about "Rocky", but there's indeed a "Rocky" feeling in this picture, where the prize to win is respect and self-respect. And this creates a double empathy from male public first, but also women who can finally see their men, boyfriends as the unsung heroes of everyday's life. I loved David with his girl, Jeannie, they were not particularly handsome, but there was a genuine love going between them. Gee, I would have loved to see them after the show, if this movie was 5 minutes longer, just something of the aftermath, but I guess their satisfactions and the cheers of the public had enough eloquence. And let's not forget that this is still a comedy, and the whole preparation of the show lead to so many memorable scenes especially the one in the Agency, where all the guys tap their feet to Donna Summer's iconic rhythm, probably one of the most gimmicky scenes of the 90's, not to mention the hilarious scenes that kept enough class not to reach certain limits. Where other movies would have probably displayed nude images, old women screaming, or other distastefully displays of raunchy humor, "The Full Monty" tackles it with a gentleness, that probably helped the film to reach a wider audience, be a popular success, and nominated to the Oscars. Definitely, one of the best of the 90's!

    Six men who were laid off when their Yorkshire steel mill closed are desperate for money. When a one-night Chippendales show comes to town and is a big hit, they decide to make their own strip show, and to make it more interesting, they'll go completely nude! The men are neither big and buff nor good dancers, but they put their hearts into preparing for the big night. This absolutely charming comedy has many touching moments, thanks to the well-developed and sympathetic characters we come to know: One is a divorced dad (Robert Carlyle) who needs to raise child support money, one is an overweight and depressed husband (Mark Addy), one cares for his aging mum, and one (Tom Wilkinson) hasn't had the nerve to tell his credit card-happy wife that he's been unemployed for six months. All of the actors are perfectly cast and it's worth the price just to see the venerable Wilkinson bump and grind to "Hot Stuff." Gritty location photography and a lively, Oscar-winning disco soundtrack help create the mood of despair giving way to hope. The North country accents and slang are sometimes unintelligible, but that in no way detracts from the fun. This fast-paced and sweet film made with a tiny budget went on to break UK box office records. Highly recommended.

    One of the more infamous British films to cross the Atlantic during the last decade and a half, "The Full Monty" was a monster success in its homeland, and was also successful in the US (and garnered four Oscar nods, including a win for Best Original Score). I'm actually surprised that it did so well. There are some appealing moments found during the 91 minute running time, but overall it's actually kind of dull. It's meant to be a breezy and amiable flick, but for a movie with such low (but earnest) ambitions, it doesn't succeed. Unemployed and out of money, Gaz (Robert Carlyle) is desperate. His son doesn't want to stay with him because his house is too cold, and he's late on his child support payments. His friends are not much better off. Then Gaz sees a Chippendales show (well, more specifically, the tons of ladies who are in the audience). That gives him an idea. If Chippendales dancers can make that much money by hiding the money shot, then think about how much money they could make if they went all the way! The movie is just too low-key to really be anything substantial. Granted, as I said, "The Full Monty" never tries to do anything groundbreaking, but we need something to keep us engaged. Apart from a few nice performances (particularly by Robert Carlyle, who's taken a successful change of pace by playing a nice, earnest guy instead of a creepy psycho), the film doesn't do that. But what really annoyed me is that the whole film is all about them going all the way, but the film doesn't have the guts to to the same. There's very little nudity, and save for one scene, the camera never shows us anything. I'm not saying that the film would have been better had they shown the guys doing "the full monty," but that's an apt description for the film. It lacks courage. Movies that want to be easy going and fancy free need to let everything flow naturally. Seeing as the Brits are among the least antsy about showing sex and nudity on screen, my thinking is that this was edited by the MPAA to avoid an NC-17 rating, or it was filmed that way in the hopes of getting a less strict rating (not that it worked...the film received an undeserved R rating). This isn't a terrible film, but it's just not that great either. My rating: PG-13 for language and brief nudity.

    The Full Monty came out in 1997 with a small four million dollar budget and grossed more than forty million dollars at the US box office and also was nominated for four academy awards including best picture. More than ten years later, it rightfully obtains its cult status. The movie is set in the famous steel making town of Sheffield, England. So once people start loosing their jobs, six unemployed factory workers (Gaz,Gerald, Dave, Nathan Lomper, and Horse) decide to become male strippers, much to the disapproval of their families. Gaz is divorced and wants full custody of his son. Gerald is lying to his wife, telling her that they can go on vacation, but he has no money, and needs the job. Dave is depressed and thinks his wife is cheating on him. Horse is an aging break dancer and wants to be back on top. Lomper is suicidal and needs something to believe in and Nathan is obsessed with Singin' In The Rain. They all decide to perform the full Monty-or completely nude. The story is simple, and feel good, but also rather predictable. But the outcome does not matter when the ride is so much fun. The Full Monty: *** stars

    Ah, The Full Monty - it warms the cockles of your heart and revives your faith in human nature.&nbsp; From the beguiling Yorkshire accents, to the ubiquitous swearing, to the liberal&nbsp; sprinklings of political incorrectness throughout, I defy anyone not love this unassuming, feel-good British comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set in Sheffield in the 80s when unemployment was rife and men were skint, this movie truly catches the spirit of the times while evoking a strange nostalgia for that shared experience of joblessness and economic doom in 80s working class Britain.&nbsp; The Full Monty comprises a motley crew of disaffected and seemingly mismatched men,&nbsp; several of whom lost their jobs in the collapse of the steel industry, and follows their day to day life as they attempt to set up a striptease act to rival the Chippendales (and, of course, earn some ready cash).&nbsp; Main man, Gav (Robert Carlyle) with his weasly face, and exasperated cries of 'foookin' 'ell!' every five minutes is bloody brilliant as is 'fat bastard' Dave (Mark Addy), and pale, suicidal carrot- top, Lomper (Steve Huison).&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as superbly showcasing working class life with all it's social problems, ugliness and pathos, The Full Monty touches on broken relationships, homosexuality and the shame and hardship of long term unemployment.&nbsp; However, the joy of this movie is that despite the struggles of these men and their families, there are no pity fests; life is what it is and you just get on with it.&nbsp; The buoyancy, cheek and unerring spiritedness&nbsp; of the characters&nbsp; keeps you smiling .&nbsp; Dancing in the dole queue, g-strings in the sitting room and cling film in the potting shed, this film's got it all - and the world is a better place for it.

    There are very few films these days that make me laugh out loud but this one managed it six or seven times! Having spent most of my adult life in the north of England, I find the humour in this one quite refreshing. It's not all fun and games though, there is quite a lot of drama to be found here and it's this element that gives the humour more bite. Great performances all round with (for me), Tom Wilkinson standing out, although they were all praiseworthy. Over all, a comedy set against the gritty reality of unemployment and all that brings. If, like me, you've been avoiding this one, don't put it off any longer, you can thank me later! SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.7/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    In the 1970's, Sheffield, England was a booming city that had a very uplifting economy and steel was the hottest staple that came out at that time as a public relations informer told me. By the 1990's came around, due to lack of funding, a lot of the steel mills were sadly foreclosed. Unemployment was on the rise, people had to seek jobs elsewhere and those who have built their reputation in these companies struggled to adapt to either menial jobs or just plain stayed home and just collected welfare checks. Gaz (Robert Carlyle "Once Upon A Time") who's a divorced man lost custody to his teenage son as his wife found another man, who happens to be more financially secure than him. He continues to make sporadic visits on occasion to see his son Nathan (Willian Snape), but goes beyond as he makes Nathan a close companion. Desperate for money, Gaz finds a way he can make a substantial amount of cash. After hearing about a group of male strippers called the Chippendales come to town they seem to make a rather handsome profit in a rented hall that's usually packed. Gaz along with his friend Dave (Mark Addy) believe they could make the same amount by putting on a similar show. The only problem is that the gentlemen they recruit to bare their all are just average looking people, not the same type of prim and dashing individuals that are the Chippendales. And what's even worse is that their dancing skills are even worst than me (which is bad because I'm in theatre). The rest of the ragtag wannabe strippers include a former factory foreman Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), and a drifter named Horse (Paul Barber) who in spite of a bad hip is able to teach them a few moves. What's very curious to me is why in the world would these women be interested in seeing not so good-looking guys take their clothes off after getting much satisfaction from the Chippendales? Gaz suggests that they might get the upper hand if they're brave enough to go the full monty by baring all. The whole idea was trashed from the start as they fear that their bodies just don't have that mass appeal to get ladies the attention as one fears he's too skinny, the other fears he's too obese and the other is just too old to bear all. In all seriousness, "The Full Monty" touches on issues about finding work and that even though it's great and rewarding to have a job, there's always a possibility that the company you work for will not be around forever. And when you lose that job because of foreclosure you feel like everything you have done was all for nought. Sheffield is the primarily example of a once sprawling city where the power balance between men and women were abolished because men in that town were unable to provide for their families. Gerald who has not had a job in six months has been lying to his wife. But when he could no longer provide for his family, his wife wants him to break up. This might have happened in Gaz's situation with his wife before the movie takes off. The film closely links Dave's insecurities is to do anything to avoid becoming jobless. In fact the closest relationship is with Dave and his wife. The cast is entirely British and most people who live on North American soil may not be familiar to this group of relative unknowns. Carlyle is probably best known for his role as Mr. Gold (Rumpelstiltskin) from the TV series "Once Upon a Time", but even though he is the leading performer here, his performance is not the best one here. The real standouts are Addy's Dave and Wilkinson's Gerald. We root for the men not because they're bearing their gifts to the ladies, but because these men are trying to win back their livelihood so they could become more employable. Wilkinson seems to be the most comfortable of the trio, but his opportunities are quite scarce and it shows. Too bad that Paul Barber's Horse doesn't get much airtime. He seemed more energetic of the characters but there was not much story to make him more developed. "The Full Monty" is one of many films to feature the poor state of the British economy In some ways it's a bit of an homage to "Brassed Off". Even the brass band featured in a dire situation in an early scene was just pure irony. But it's still a good comedy and even though it's over-the-top in content, the situation the characters face are real and may reflect that of the situation of the economy we're facing as I speak.

    Sometimes the timing of a film's release is so accidentally perfect that it captures the mood of the public and becomes a hit. Such a film is The Full Monty. Made on a meagre budget of &pound;3 million, this small Sheffield-set comedy-drama went to achieve unprecedented commercial and critical success. It became the highest grossing film to that point at the UK box office; was nominated for the prestigious Best Picture Oscar (losing out to Titanic); and scooped several BAFTAs including Best Film and Best Actor for Robert Carlyle. A fine haul indeed for a modest little production set in a run-down neighbourhood of the steel city. Struggling ex-steelworkers Gaz (Robert Carlyle) and Dave (Mark Addy) spend their days breaking into shut-down steel mills searching for scrap metal to steal and sell. Sometimes they are joined by Gaz's son Nathan (William Snape), his child from a broken relationship with ex-wife Mandy (Emily Woof). One day Gaz notices a number of women entering a local social club and discovers that they are going to watch a male strip show. He hits upon the idea of raising a little money by putting on his own show. Enlisting other unemployed desperadoes like his former manager Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), ex-security guard Lomper (Steve Huison), smooth mover Horse (Paul Barber) and well-endowed hunk Guy (Hugo Speer), the unlikely lotharios set about practising their dance moves and perfecting a raunchy routine. The stakes are upped considerably when some women spot the lads putting up posters to advertise their show. When the women laugh off their ambitious scheme, Gaz decides to up the ante by telling them they will be going "the Full Monty" (fully naked). "Nobody said anything to me about the Full Monty!" gasps Horse, but his protests come too late the word is already out and the guys have a 400-strong audience of baying women to satisfy. In truth, The Full Monty could quite easily have turned up as a feature length TV-style drama - at first glance it certainly isn't an especially cinematic sort of film (e.g. a film that belongs on the big screen). Thanks to Simon Beaufoy's cracking script and the game performances, it transcends its small roots to become a thoroughly enjoyable story indeed. Performances that stand out include Carlyle as the desperate Gaz, Addy as the terribly self-conscious and overweight Dave, and Wilkinson as their once-proud manager, now reduced to teaching a bunch of 'commoners' to dance (as well as joining them in their potentially humiliating enterprise). Most of the performances are strong right down the cast list, but these three are a notch ahead of the rest. The dialogue is often very funny and the grim locations add to the film's sense of social deprivation and desperation. Like most comedies, repeat viewings gradually diminish the film's humour and freshness but first time round it is a vastly entertaining film, successfully managing to generate a feel-good atmosphere within its grimmest of settings. Director Peter Cattaneo never really pushed on after The Full Monty  to date he has only made three other features (none of which match the giddy heights of this one). It's a shame that he hasn't been able to capitalise on such a phenomenally successful debut. As Yorkshire-based cinema goes, The Full Monty is the most successful film ever to have come out of the region. It's also one of the best.

    I am not somebody who has any problems with dirty humor or is too prude to watch a movie with a sexual plot. And yet I am very impressed how they managed to take the storyline about men becoming strippers and produce a movie that is so sweet and in a way innocent. I am even surprised it was R rated. The reason is that we get to know the characters from their vulnerable side. We can see their desperation that drives them to this decision and we can feel their insecurities. I don't want to make it sound as if it is some tear jerker, it is not. In fact it is a very funny movie, but at the same time it has so much humanity. The best scenes in the movie are the auditions and practice scenes. Hilarious. I definitely recommend this movie. It is funny, light hearted and with great acting. But people who have the same problem as me in understanding accents should make sure they have captions on.

    The thing that stands out about this movie is that it seemed to have brought a new phrase into the English language, and that is "going the full monty." Generally it means to take off all of your clothes, but in another way it simply means going all of the way. One thing is true, not many movies can claim to have had an impact on the English language, but this one has. Now, the concept of a movie about male strippers doesn't really appeal to me. One would expect it to be rated R, but it is not. The ratings say that it contains nudity, but for an M rating all you can expect to see is bare bums, and yes that is what you do see. The Full Monty is actually about much more than simple male strippers: it is about self pride, image, unemployment, and simple trust. It is a movie with a lot of depth but is also quite funny. The Full Monty is set in the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire, England. The movie opens with an expose on Sheffield being a boom town with the steel industry, but 25 years later the steel mill has closed down and the city is suffering from high unemployment. This seems to be a common idea that runs through English television  the bleakness of life and the hopelessness of unemployment. I remember before the last English election when the Conservative Party lost to the Labour Party, that they interviewed people in some of the English towns where unemployment was very high, and the people had simply lost hope. So has it happened in this movie: people have lost hope to the point where they no longer wish to live. But there is hope on the horizon: Gaz and Dave, the main characters, sneak into a female only strip show and realise that these guys are getting paid ten pounds a head to simply take off their cloths. This gives Gaz an idea: he has much more than these guys, and he is willing to go the Full Monty, so why not get involved. So he and Dave get some people together to become male strippers with them. I expected the movie to be about them going on the nightclub circuit, becoming really famous, and then loosing everything: but it is not the case. Rather it is about the relationships between the people and the work the do to get to the strip show at the end. It is about their pride and overcoming it to humiliate themselves in front of a lot of ladies. It is also about how they try to hide this from everybody to save themselves the embarrassment. It seems that hiding things from people is another aspect of this movie. Dave hides the fact that he is becoming a male stripper from his wife, thinking that she is going to deride him because he is over weight. The truth is, she really doesn't care. She don't care if he is overweight: she loves him the way he is and she doesn't care if he goes the full monty. Then there is Dave and Gaz's former foreman. He has been unemployed for six months, yet he is ashamed of it and keeps this from his wife. As such she continues to go obliviously spending as if he were still working. She still has her dreams of going skiing. In the end, when she finds out, her quote is "I can handle the television being reposed, but what I cannot stand is that you kept this from me." This relationship is one on assumptions. The partners assume to much about each other and discover that in the end they really don't know that much about each other at all. The shame of stripping against the shame of being unemployed is what really runs through this movie. There is the bleakness of Job Club and the dole queue, lightened up by the strippers starting to dance to a song playing over the radio. Then there is the shame that they face when they are caught practicing in an abandoned factory. Not only do they face a mocking police force, but also the story hits the front page, and everybody knows. But then, they discovered that this newspaper article is the best advertising they could have got. The Full Monty is much better that I originally expected. It is not simply a movie about male strippers, but about the characters that they are and the struggles that they face trying to find a niche in society. Rather than being a movie that one compromises on when trying to find one at a video store, it should be one that is on the too see list.

    "The Full Monty" is a good-hearted comedy that the cynical nineties were begging for, and its Britain again that surprises the world with something new, fresh, pleasant and that could appeal to the whole family, despite some adult undertones. Overall, despite the adult material (hot) stuff, there is a sweet innocence mixed with the very inspirational message that every average Joe can have chance to do something different and be, a night long, THE big star, applauded and cheered by a crowd of roaring women. It's a celebration of optimism and trust in out deepest fantasies with the touch of realism that the movie needed so we wouldn't forget that these men do it for money, more than recognition. And this is an important element because it keeps the identification process with the protagonist totally intact. The casting is ideal because it shows every range of masculine adult demography, old, young, father, single, with neither racial nor sexual orientations' prejudices, so everyone can relate to them. It's a film that reconciles the public with the idea that men can also be targeted by the evolution of society, consumption society that advertises the image of clean-cut faces and muscular bodies with the same zealous marketing as for women's tits and sexy legs. Average men suffer from a tacit rejection, because basically, every time, their women, or for that matter, the women they'd like to be with, are confronted to messages indirectly shouting: "They are unemployed, ugly, lazy, they are losers". "The Full Monty" is a comedic response to a very serious social issue and the kindheartedness of the film proves that humor sometimes can be the best weapon to deal with rejection. Comedic tones still have these particularities that they're not meant to be taken seriously, but I think what makes the best comedies is precisely the ability to make people laugh and move them at the same time. Even screwball comedies can be exasperating if they don't let you catch your breath and appreciate some sensitivity. And this is the strength of "The Full Monty", being able to tell us very touching separate stories that will all converge to a same need: having a job, making money, being respected. I said 'respected' and not 'admired' because 'admiration' would be taking itself too seriously and the suspension of disbelief wouldn't work. The stories are centered on three men who all used to work in the steel factory which is to Sheffield (England) what the Nuclear Power Plant is to "The Simpsons"' Springfield, before the economical crisis, before unemployment, a problem still relevant today. Robert Carlyle, who played the demented Begbie in "Trainspotting" is in a totally opposite role as the leader of the group, Gaz, who'll encourage his buddies to 'do it', to prove that they're not an endangered species, that they are the real men. Mark Addy is Dave, his best friend, a lovable teddy bear of a guy who doesn't trust his wife, not even himself, he's the kind of character you want to put near you just to show him the film and how people really think about him, he could have been annoying if he didn't have so many qualities, among them, loyalty, kindness and a heart as big as his belly. And Gerald is the older and wiser man, who supervised them in the factory before unemployment. He's the one who practices dance and can help to produce the miracle. Three more men will join the group, and the only one to know about the secret is Nathan, Gaz's son, his inspiration to show that he's better than what her mother, and her new husband say. The film doesn't avoid some stereotypical situations but it would be unfair to criticize that, since the newness relies on the show these guys will do, the Chippendales, and no other movie did that before. And even when Chippendales did it, it wasn't "The Full Monty". And no other movie dealt with male nudity, with sexiness, with "Hot Stuff" in a light-hearted tone. The script is surely one of the movie's main strengths, because the strip-tease aspect is only a plot device, the point is elsewhere, it's about proving value. I won't develop that subject because all I need is to copy-paste everything I said about "Rocky", but there's indeed a "Rocky" feeling in this picture, where the prize to win is respect and self-respect. And this creates a double empathy from male public first, but also women who can finally see their men, boyfriends as the unsung heroes of everyday's life. I loved David with his girl, Jeannie, they were not particularly handsome, but there was a genuine love going between them. Gee, I would have loved to see them after the show, if this movie was 5 minutes longer, just something of the aftermath, but I guess their satisfactions and the cheers of the public had enough eloquence. And let's not forget that this is still a comedy, and the whole preparation of the show lead to so many memorable scenes especially the one in the Agency, where all the guys tap their feet to Donna Summer's iconic rhythm, probably one of the most gimmicky scenes of the 90's, not to mention the hilarious scenes that kept enough class not to reach certain limits. Where other movies would have probably displayed nude images, old women screaming, or other distastefully displays of raunchy humor, "The Full Monty" tackles it with a gentleness, that probably helped the film to reach a wider audience, be a popular success, and nominated to the Oscars. Definitely, one of the best of the 90's!

    Six men who were laid off when their Yorkshire steel mill closed are desperate for money. When a one-night Chippendales show comes to town and is a big hit, they decide to make their own strip show, and to make it more interesting, they'll go completely nude! The men are neither big and buff nor good dancers, but they put their hearts into preparing for the big night. This absolutely charming comedy has many touching moments, thanks to the well-developed and sympathetic characters we come to know: One is a divorced dad (Robert Carlyle) who needs to raise child support money, one is an overweight and depressed husband (Mark Addy), one cares for his aging mum, and one (Tom Wilkinson) hasn't had the nerve to tell his credit card-happy wife that he's been unemployed for six months. All of the actors are perfectly cast and it's worth the price just to see the venerable Wilkinson bump and grind to "Hot Stuff." Gritty location photography and a lively, Oscar-winning disco soundtrack help create the mood of despair giving way to hope. The North country accents and slang are sometimes unintelligible, but that in no way detracts from the fun. This fast-paced and sweet film made with a tiny budget went on to break UK box office records. Highly recommended.

    One of the more infamous British films to cross the Atlantic during the last decade and a half, "The Full Monty" was a monster success in its homeland, and was also successful in the US (and garnered four Oscar nods, including a win for Best Original Score). I'm actually surprised that it did so well. There are some appealing moments found during the 91 minute running time, but overall it's actually kind of dull. It's meant to be a breezy and amiable flick, but for a movie with such low (but earnest) ambitions, it doesn't succeed. Unemployed and out of money, Gaz (Robert Carlyle) is desperate. His son doesn't want to stay with him because his house is too cold, and he's late on his child support payments. His friends are not much better off. Then Gaz sees a Chippendales show (well, more specifically, the tons of ladies who are in the audience). That gives him an idea. If Chippendales dancers can make that much money by hiding the money shot, then think about how much money they could make if they went all the way! The movie is just too low-key to really be anything substantial. Granted, as I said, "The Full Monty" never tries to do anything groundbreaking, but we need something to keep us engaged. Apart from a few nice performances (particularly by Robert Carlyle, who's taken a successful change of pace by playing a nice, earnest guy instead of a creepy psycho), the film doesn't do that. But what really annoyed me is that the whole film is all about them going all the way, but the film doesn't have the guts to to the same. There's very little nudity, and save for one scene, the camera never shows us anything. I'm not saying that the film would have been better had they shown the guys doing "the full monty," but that's an apt description for the film. It lacks courage. Movies that want to be easy going and fancy free need to let everything flow naturally. Seeing as the Brits are among the least antsy about showing sex and nudity on screen, my thinking is that this was edited by the MPAA to avoid an NC-17 rating, or it was filmed that way in the hopes of getting a less strict rating (not that it worked...the film received an undeserved R rating). This isn't a terrible film, but it's just not that great either. My rating: PG-13 for language and brief nudity.

    The Full Monty came out in 1997 with a small four million dollar budget and grossed more than forty million dollars at the US box office and also was nominated for four academy awards including best picture. More than ten years later, it rightfully obtains its cult status. The movie is set in the famous steel making town of Sheffield, England. So once people start loosing their jobs, six unemployed factory workers (Gaz,Gerald, Dave, Nathan Lomper, and Horse) decide to become male strippers, much to the disapproval of their families. Gaz is divorced and wants full custody of his son. Gerald is lying to his wife, telling her that they can go on vacation, but he has no money, and needs the job. Dave is depressed and thinks his wife is cheating on him. Horse is an aging break dancer and wants to be back on top. Lomper is suicidal and needs something to believe in and Nathan is obsessed with Singin' In The Rain. They all decide to perform the full Monty-or completely nude. The story is simple, and feel good, but also rather predictable. But the outcome does not matter when the ride is so much fun. The Full Monty: *** stars

    Ah, The Full Monty - it warms the cockles of your heart and revives your faith in human nature.&nbsp; From the beguiling Yorkshire accents, to the ubiquitous swearing, to the liberal&nbsp; sprinklings of political incorrectness throughout, I defy anyone not love this unassuming, feel-good British comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set in Sheffield in the 80s when unemployment was rife and men were skint, this movie truly catches the spirit of the times while evoking a strange nostalgia for that shared experience of joblessness and economic doom in 80s working class Britain.&nbsp; The Full Monty comprises a motley crew of disaffected and seemingly mismatched men,&nbsp; several of whom lost their jobs in the collapse of the steel industry, and follows their day to day life as they attempt to set up a striptease act to rival the Chippendales (and, of course, earn some ready cash).&nbsp; Main man, Gav (Robert Carlyle) with his weasly face, and exasperated cries of 'foookin' 'ell!' every five minutes is bloody brilliant as is 'fat bastard' Dave (Mark Addy), and pale, suicidal carrot- top, Lomper (Steve Huison).&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as superbly showcasing working class life with all it's social problems, ugliness and pathos, The Full Monty touches on broken relationships, homosexuality and the shame and hardship of long term unemployment.&nbsp; However, the joy of this movie is that despite the struggles of these men and their families, there are no pity fests; life is what it is and you just get on with it.&nbsp; The buoyancy, cheek and unerring spiritedness&nbsp; of the characters&nbsp; keeps you smiling .&nbsp; Dancing in the dole queue, g-strings in the sitting room and cling film in the potting shed, this film's got it all - and the world is a better place for it.

    There are very few films these days that make me laugh out loud but this one managed it six or seven times! Having spent most of my adult life in the north of England, I find the humour in this one quite refreshing. It's not all fun and games though, there is quite a lot of drama to be found here and it's this element that gives the humour more bite. Great performances all round with (for me), Tom Wilkinson standing out, although they were all praiseworthy. Over all, a comedy set against the gritty reality of unemployment and all that brings. If, like me, you've been avoiding this one, don't put it off any longer, you can thank me later! SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.7/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    In the 1970's, Sheffield, England was a booming city that had a very uplifting economy and steel was the hottest staple that came out at that time as a public relations informer told me. By the 1990's came around, due to lack of funding, a lot of the steel mills were sadly foreclosed. Unemployment was on the rise, people had to seek jobs elsewhere and those who have built their reputation in these companies struggled to adapt to either menial jobs or just plain stayed home and just collected welfare checks. Gaz (Robert Carlyle "Once Upon A Time") who's a divorced man lost custody to his teenage son as his wife found another man, who happens to be more financially secure than him. He continues to make sporadic visits on occasion to see his son Nathan (Willian Snape), but goes beyond as he makes Nathan a close companion. Desperate for money, Gaz finds a way he can make a substantial amount of cash. After hearing about a group of male strippers called the Chippendales come to town they seem to make a rather handsome profit in a rented hall that's usually packed. Gaz along with his friend Dave (Mark Addy) believe they could make the same amount by putting on a similar show. The only problem is that the gentlemen they recruit to bare their all are just average looking people, not the same type of prim and dashing individuals that are the Chippendales. And what's even worse is that their dancing skills are even worst than me (which is bad because I'm in theatre). The rest of the ragtag wannabe strippers include a former factory foreman Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), and a drifter named Horse (Paul Barber) who in spite of a bad hip is able to teach them a few moves. What's very curious to me is why in the world would these women be interested in seeing not so good-looking guys take their clothes off after getting much satisfaction from the Chippendales? Gaz suggests that they might get the upper hand if they're brave enough to go the full monty by baring all. The whole idea was trashed from the start as they fear that their bodies just don't have that mass appeal to get ladies the attention as one fears he's too skinny, the other fears he's too obese and the other is just too old to bear all. In all seriousness, "The Full Monty" touches on issues about finding work and that even though it's great and rewarding to have a job, there's always a possibility that the company you work for will not be around forever. And when you lose that job because of foreclosure you feel like everything you have done was all for nought. Sheffield is the primarily example of a once sprawling city where the power balance between men and women were abolished because men in that town were unable to provide for their families. Gerald who has not had a job in six months has been lying to his wife. But when he could no longer provide for his family, his wife wants him to break up. This might have happened in Gaz's situation with his wife before the movie takes off. The film closely links Dave's insecurities is to do anything to avoid becoming jobless. In fact the closest relationship is with Dave and his wife. The cast is entirely British and most people who live on North American soil may not be familiar to this group of relative unknowns. Carlyle is probably best known for his role as Mr. Gold (Rumpelstiltskin) from the TV series "Once Upon a Time", but even though he is the leading performer here, his performance is not the best one here. The real standouts are Addy's Dave and Wilkinson's Gerald. We root for the men not because they're bearing their gifts to the ladies, but because these men are trying to win back their livelihood so they could become more employable. Wilkinson seems to be the most comfortable of the trio, but his opportunities are quite scarce and it shows. Too bad that Paul Barber's Horse doesn't get much airtime. He seemed more energetic of the characters but there was not much story to make him more developed. "The Full Monty" is one of many films to feature the poor state of the British economy In some ways it's a bit of an homage to "Brassed Off". Even the brass band featured in a dire situation in an early scene was just pure irony. But it's still a good comedy and even though it's over-the-top in content, the situation the characters face are real and may reflect that of the situation of the economy we're facing as I speak.

    Sometimes the timing of a film's release is so accidentally perfect that it captures the mood of the public and becomes a hit. Such a film is The Full Monty. Made on a meagre budget of &pound;3 million, this small Sheffield-set comedy-drama went to achieve unprecedented commercial and critical success. It became the highest grossing film to that point at the UK box office; was nominated for the prestigious Best Picture Oscar (losing out to Titanic); and scooped several BAFTAs including Best Film and Best Actor for Robert Carlyle. A fine haul indeed for a modest little production set in a run-down neighbourhood of the steel city. Struggling ex-steelworkers Gaz (Robert Carlyle) and Dave (Mark Addy) spend their days breaking into shut-down steel mills searching for scrap metal to steal and sell. Sometimes they are joined by Gaz's son Nathan (William Snape), his child from a broken relationship with ex-wife Mandy (Emily Woof). One day Gaz notices a number of women entering a local social club and discovers that they are going to watch a male strip show. He hits upon the idea of raising a little money by putting on his own show. Enlisting other unemployed desperadoes like his former manager Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), ex-security guard Lomper (Steve Huison), smooth mover Horse (Paul Barber) and well-endowed hunk Guy (Hugo Speer), the unlikely lotharios set about practising their dance moves and perfecting a raunchy routine. The stakes are upped considerably when some women spot the lads putting up posters to advertise their show. When the women laugh off their ambitious scheme, Gaz decides to up the ante by telling them they will be going "the Full Monty" (fully naked). "Nobody said anything to me about the Full Monty!" gasps Horse, but his protests come too late the word is already out and the guys have a 400-strong audience of baying women to satisfy. In truth, The Full Monty could quite easily have turned up as a feature length TV-style drama - at first glance it certainly isn't an especially cinematic sort of film (e.g. a film that belongs on the big screen). Thanks to Simon Beaufoy's cracking script and the game performances, it transcends its small roots to become a thoroughly enjoyable story indeed. Performances that stand out include Carlyle as the desperate Gaz, Addy as the terribly self-conscious and overweight Dave, and Wilkinson as their once-proud manager, now reduced to teaching a bunch of 'commoners' to dance (as well as joining them in their potentially humiliating enterprise). Most of the performances are strong right down the cast list, but these three are a notch ahead of the rest. The dialogue is often very funny and the grim locations add to the film's sense of social deprivation and desperation. Like most comedies, repeat viewings gradually diminish the film's humour and freshness but first time round it is a vastly entertaining film, successfully managing to generate a feel-good atmosphere within its grimmest of settings. Director Peter Cattaneo never really pushed on after The Full Monty  to date he has only made three other features (none of which match the giddy heights of this one). It's a shame that he hasn't been able to capitalise on such a phenomenally successful debut. As Yorkshire-based cinema goes, The Full Monty is the most successful film ever to have come out of the region. It's also one of the best.

    I am not somebody who has any problems with dirty humor or is too prude to watch a movie with a sexual plot. And yet I am very impressed how they managed to take the storyline about men becoming strippers and produce a movie that is so sweet and in a way innocent. I am even surprised it was R rated. The reason is that we get to know the characters from their vulnerable side. We can see their desperation that drives them to this decision and we can feel their insecurities. I don't want to make it sound as if it is some tear jerker, it is not. In fact it is a very funny movie, but at the same time it has so much humanity. The best scenes in the movie are the auditions and practice scenes. Hilarious. I definitely recommend this movie. It is funny, light hearted and with great acting. But people who have the same problem as me in understanding accents should make sure they have captions on.

    The thing that stands out about this movie is that it seemed to have brought a new phrase into the English language, and that is "going the full monty." Generally it means to take off all of your clothes, but in another way it simply means going all of the way. One thing is true, not many movies can claim to have had an impact on the English language, but this one has. Now, the concept of a movie about male strippers doesn't really appeal to me. One would expect it to be rated R, but it is not. The ratings say that it contains nudity, but for an M rating all you can expect to see is bare bums, and yes that is what you do see. The Full Monty is actually about much more than simple male strippers: it is about self pride, image, unemployment, and simple trust. It is a movie with a lot of depth but is also quite funny. The Full Monty is set in the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire, England. The movie opens with an expose on Sheffield being a boom town with the steel industry, but 25 years later the steel mill has closed down and the city is suffering from high unemployment. This seems to be a common idea that runs through English television  the bleakness of life and the hopelessness of unemployment. I remember before the last English election when the Conservative Party lost to the Labour Party, that they interviewed people in some of the English towns where unemployment was very high, and the people had simply lost hope. So has it happened in this movie: people have lost hope to the point where they no longer wish to live. But there is hope on the horizon: Gaz and Dave, the main characters, sneak into a female only strip show and realise that these guys are getting paid ten pounds a head to simply take off their cloths. This gives Gaz an idea: he has much more than these guys, and he is willing to go the Full Monty, so why not get involved. So he and Dave get some people together to become male strippers with them. I expected the movie to be about them going on the nightclub circuit, becoming really famous, and then loosing everything: but it is not the case. Rather it is about the relationships between the people and the work the do to get to the strip show at the end. It is about their pride and overcoming it to humiliate themselves in front of a lot of ladies. It is also about how they try to hide this from everybody to save themselves the embarrassment. It seems that hiding things from people is another aspect of this movie. Dave hides the fact that he is becoming a male stripper from his wife, thinking that she is going to deride him because he is over weight. The truth is, she really doesn't care. She don't care if he is overweight: she loves him the way he is and she doesn't care if he goes the full monty. Then there is Dave and Gaz's former foreman. He has been unemployed for six months, yet he is ashamed of it and keeps this from his wife. As such she continues to go obliviously spending as if he were still working. She still has her dreams of going skiing. In the end, when she finds out, her quote is "I can handle the television being reposed, but what I cannot stand is that you kept this from me." This relationship is one on assumptions. The partners assume to much about each other and discover that in the end they really don't know that much about each other at all. The shame of stripping against the shame of being unemployed is what really runs through this movie. There is the bleakness of Job Club and the dole queue, lightened up by the strippers starting to dance to a song playing over the radio. Then there is the shame that they face when they are caught practicing in an abandoned factory. Not only do they face a mocking police force, but also the story hits the front page, and everybody knows. But then, they discovered that this newspaper article is the best advertising they could have got. The Full Monty is much better that I originally expected. It is not simply a movie about male strippers, but about the characters that they are and the struggles that they face trying to find a niche in society. Rather than being a movie that one compromises on when trying to find one at a video store, it should be one that is on the too see list.

    "The Full Monty" is a good-hearted comedy that the cynical nineties were begging for, and its Britain again that surprises the world with something new, fresh, pleasant and that could appeal to the whole family, despite some adult undertones. Overall, despite the adult material (hot) stuff, there is a sweet innocence mixed with the very inspirational message that every average Joe can have chance to do something different and be, a night long, THE big star, applauded and cheered by a crowd of roaring women. It's a celebration of optimism and trust in out deepest fantasies with the touch of realism that the movie needed so we wouldn't forget that these men do it for money, more than recognition. And this is an important element because it keeps the identification process with the protagonist totally intact. The casting is ideal because it shows every range of masculine adult demography, old, young, father, single, with neither racial nor sexual orientations' prejudices, so everyone can relate to them. It's a film that reconciles the public with the idea that men can also be targeted by the evolution of society, consumption society that advertises the image of clean-cut faces and muscular bodies with the same zealous marketing as for women's tits and sexy legs. Average men suffer from a tacit rejection, because basically, every time, their women, or for that matter, the women they'd like to be with, are confronted to messages indirectly shouting: "They are unemployed, ugly, lazy, they are losers". "The Full Monty" is a comedic response to a very serious social issue and the kindheartedness of the film proves that humor sometimes can be the best weapon to deal with rejection. Comedic tones still have these particularities that they're not meant to be taken seriously, but I think what makes the best comedies is precisely the ability to make people laugh and move them at the same time. Even screwball comedies can be exasperating if they don't let you catch your breath and appreciate some sensitivity. And this is the strength of "The Full Monty", being able to tell us very touching separate stories that will all converge to a same need: having a job, making money, being respected. I said 'respected' and not 'admired' because 'admiration' would be taking itself too seriously and the suspension of disbelief wouldn't work. The stories are centered on three men who all used to work in the steel factory which is to Sheffield (England) what the Nuclear Power Plant is to "The Simpsons"' Springfield, before the economical crisis, before unemployment, a problem still relevant today. Robert Carlyle, who played the demented Begbie in "Trainspotting" is in a totally opposite role as the leader of the group, Gaz, who'll encourage his buddies to 'do it', to prove that they're not an endangered species, that they are the real men. Mark Addy is Dave, his best friend, a lovable teddy bear of a guy who doesn't trust his wife, not even himself, he's the kind of character you want to put near you just to show him the film and how people really think about him, he could have been annoying if he didn't have so many qualities, among them, loyalty, kindness and a heart as big as his belly. And Gerald is the older and wiser man, who supervised them in the factory before unemployment. He's the one who practices dance and can help to produce the miracle. Three more men will join the group, and the only one to know about the secret is Nathan, Gaz's son, his inspiration to show that he's better than what her mother, and her new husband say. The film doesn't avoid some stereotypical situations but it would be unfair to criticize that, since the newness relies on the show these guys will do, the Chippendales, and no other movie did that before. And even when Chippendales did it, it wasn't "The Full Monty". And no other movie dealt with male nudity, with sexiness, with "Hot Stuff" in a light-hearted tone. The script is surely one of the movie's main strengths, because the strip-tease aspect is only a plot device, the point is elsewhere, it's about proving value. I won't develop that subject because all I need is to copy-paste everything I said about "Rocky", but there's indeed a "Rocky" feeling in this picture, where the prize to win is respect and self-respect. And this creates a double empathy from male public first, but also women who can finally see their men, boyfriends as the unsung heroes of everyday's life. I loved David with his girl, Jeannie, they were not particularly handsome, but there was a genuine love going between them. Gee, I would have loved to see them after the show, if this movie was 5 minutes longer, just something of the aftermath, but I guess their satisfactions and the cheers of the public had enough eloquence. And let's not forget that this is still a comedy, and the whole preparation of the show lead to so many memorable scenes especially the one in the Agency, where all the guys tap their feet to Donna Summer's iconic rhythm, probably one of the most gimmicky scenes of the 90's, not to mention the hilarious scenes that kept enough class not to reach certain limits. Where other movies would have probably displayed nude images, old women screaming, or other distastefully displays of raunchy humor, "The Full Monty" tackles it with a gentleness, that probably helped the film to reach a wider audience, be a popular success, and nominated to the Oscars. Definitely, one of the best of the 90's!

    Six men who were laid off when their Yorkshire steel mill closed are desperate for money. When a one-night Chippendales show comes to town and is a big hit, they decide to make their own strip show, and to make it more interesting, they'll go completely nude! The men are neither big and buff nor good dancers, but they put their hearts into preparing for the big night. This absolutely charming comedy has many touching moments, thanks to the well-developed and sympathetic characters we come to know: One is a divorced dad (Robert Carlyle) who needs to raise child support money, one is an overweight and depressed husband (Mark Addy), one cares for his aging mum, and one (Tom Wilkinson) hasn't had the nerve to tell his credit card-happy wife that he's been unemployed for six months. All of the actors are perfectly cast and it's worth the price just to see the venerable Wilkinson bump and grind to "Hot Stuff." Gritty location photography and a lively, Oscar-winning disco soundtrack help create the mood of despair giving way to hope. The North country accents and slang are sometimes unintelligible, but that in no way detracts from the fun. This fast-paced and sweet film made with a tiny budget went on to break UK box office records. Highly recommended.

    One of the more infamous British films to cross the Atlantic during the last decade and a half, "The Full Monty" was a monster success in its homeland, and was also successful in the US (and garnered four Oscar nods, including a win for Best Original Score). I'm actually surprised that it did so well. There are some appealing moments found during the 91 minute running time, but overall it's actually kind of dull. It's meant to be a breezy and amiable flick, but for a movie with such low (but earnest) ambitions, it doesn't succeed. Unemployed and out of money, Gaz (Robert Carlyle) is desperate. His son doesn't want to stay with him because his house is too cold, and he's late on his child support payments. His friends are not much better off. Then Gaz sees a Chippendales show (well, more specifically, the tons of ladies who are in the audience). That gives him an idea. If Chippendales dancers can make that much money by hiding the money shot, then think about how much money they could make if they went all the way! The movie is just too low-key to really be anything substantial. Granted, as I said, "The Full Monty" never tries to do anything groundbreaking, but we need something to keep us engaged. Apart from a few nice performances (particularly by Robert Carlyle, who's taken a successful change of pace by playing a nice, earnest guy instead of a creepy psycho), the film doesn't do that. But what really annoyed me is that the whole film is all about them going all the way, but the film doesn't have the guts to to the same. There's very little nudity, and save for one scene, the camera never shows us anything. I'm not saying that the film would have been better had they shown the guys doing "the full monty," but that's an apt description for the film. It lacks courage.

    The Full Monty came out in 1997 with a small four million dollar budget and grossed more than forty million dollars at the US box office and also was nominated for four academy awards including best picture. More than ten years later, it rightfully obtains its cult status. The movie is set in the famous steel making town of Sheffield, England. So once people start loosing their jobs, six unemployed factory workers (Gaz,Gerald, Dave, Nathan Lomper, and Horse) decide to become male strippers, much to the disapproval of their families. Gaz is divorced and wants full custody of his son. Gerald is lying to his wife, telling her that they can go on vacation, but he has no money, and needs the job. Dave is depressed and thinks his wife is cheating on him. Horse is an aging break dancer and wants to be back on top. Lomper is suicidal and needs something to believe in and Nathan is obsessed with Singin' In The Rain. They all decide to perform the full Monty-or completely nude. The story is simple, and feel good, but also rather predictable. But the outcome does not matter when the ride is so much fun. The Full Monty: *** stars

    Ah, The Full Monty - it warms the cockles of your heart and revives your faith in human nature.&nbsp; From the beguiling Yorkshire accents, to the ubiquitous swearing, to the liberal&nbsp; sprinklings of political incorrectness throughout, I defy anyone not love this unassuming, feel-good British comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set in Sheffield in the 80s when unemployment was rife and men were skint, this movie truly catches the spirit of the times while evoking a strange nostalgia for that shared experience of joblessness and economic doom in 80s working class Britain.&nbsp; The Full Monty comprises a motley crew of disaffected and seemingly mismatched men,&nbsp; several of whom lost their jobs in the collapse of the steel industry, and follows their day to day life as they attempt to set up a striptease act to rival the Chippendales (and, of course, earn some ready cash).&nbsp; Main man, Gav (Robert Carlyle) with his weasly face, and exasperated cries of 'foookin' 'ell!' every five minutes is bloody brilliant as is 'fat bastard' Dave (Mark Addy), and pale, suicidal carrot- top, Lomper (Steve Huison).&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as superbly showcasing working class life with all it's social problems, ugliness and pathos, The Full Monty touches on broken relationships, homosexuality and the shame and hardship of long term unemployment.&nbsp; However, the joy of this movie is that despite the struggles of these men and their families, there are no pity fests; life is what it is and you just get on with it.&nbsp; The buoyancy, cheek and unerring spiritedness&nbsp; of the characters&nbsp; keeps you smiling .&nbsp; Dancing in the dole queue, g-strings in the sitting room and cling film in the potting shed, this film's got it all - and the world is a better place for it.

    There are very few films these days that make me laugh out loud but this one managed it six or seven times! Having spent most of my adult life in the north of England, I find the humour in this one quite refreshing. It's not all fun and games though, there is quite a lot of drama to be found here and it's this element that gives the humour more bite. Great performances all round with (for me), Tom Wilkinson standing out, although they were all praiseworthy. Over all, a comedy set against the gritty reality of unemployment and all that brings. If, like me, you've been avoiding this one, don't put it off any longer, you can thank me later! SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.7/10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

    In the 1970's, Sheffield, England was a booming city that had a very uplifting economy and steel was the hottest staple that came out at that time as a public relations informer told me. By the 1990's came around, due to lack of funding, a lot of the steel mills were sadly foreclosed. Unemployment was on the rise, people had to seek jobs elsewhere and those who have built their reputation in these companies struggled to adapt to either menial jobs or just plain stayed home and just collected welfare checks. Gaz (Robert Carlyle "Once Upon A Time") who's a divorced man lost custody to his teenage son as his wife found another man, who happens to be more financially secure than him. He continues to make sporadic visits on occasion to see his son Nathan (Willian Snape), but goes beyond as he makes Nathan a close companion. Desperate for money, Gaz finds a way he can make a substantial amount of cash. After hearing about a group of male strippers called the Chippendales come to town they seem to make a rather handsome profit in a rented hall that's usually packed. Gaz along with his friend Dave (Mark Addy) believe they could make the same amount by putting on a similar show. The only problem is that the gentlemen they recruit to bare their all are just average looking people, not the same type of prim and dashing individuals that are the Chippendales. And what's even worse is that their dancing skills are even worst than me (which is bad because I'm in theatre). The rest of the ragtag wannabe strippers include a former factory foreman Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), and a drifter named Horse (Paul Barber) who in spite of a bad hip is able to teach them a few moves. What's very curious to me is why in the world would these women be interested in seeing not so good-looking guys take their clothes off after getting much satisfaction from the Chippendales? Gaz suggests that they might get the upper hand if they're brave enough to go the full monty by baring all. The whole idea was trashed from the start as they fear that their bodies just don't have that mass appeal to get ladies the attention as one fears he's too skinny, the other fears he's too obese and the other is just too old to bear all. In all seriousness, "The Full Monty" touches on issues about finding work and that even though it's great and rewarding to have a job, there's always a possibility that the company you work for will not be around forever. And when you lose that job because of foreclosure you feel like everything you have done was all for nought. Sheffield is the primarily example of a once sprawling city where the power balance between men and women were abolished because men in that town were unable to provide for their families. Gerald who has not had a job in six months has been lying to his wife. But when he could no longer provide for his family, his wife wants him to break up. This might have happened in Gaz's situation with his wife before the movie takes off. The film closely links Dave's insecurities is to do anything to avoid becoming jobless. In fact the closest relationship is with Dave and his wife. The cast is entirely British and most people who live on North American soil may not be familiar to this group of relative unknowns. Carlyle is probably best known for his role as Mr. Gold (Rumpelstiltskin) from the TV series "Once Upon a Time", but even though he is the leading performer here, his performance is not the best one here. The real standouts are Addy's Dave and Wilkinson's Gerald. We root for the men not because they're bearing their gifts to the ladies, but because these men are trying to win back their livelihood so they could become more employable. Wilkinson seems to be the most comfortable of the trio, but his opportunities are quite scarce and it shows. Too bad that Paul Barber's Horse doesn't get much airtime. He seemed more energetic of the characters but there was not much story to make him more developed. "The Full Monty" is one of many films to feature the poor state of the British economy In some ways it's a bit of an homage to "Brassed Off". Even the brass band featured in a dire situation in an early scene was just pure irony. But it's still a good comedy and even though it's over-the-top in content, the situation the characters face are real and may reflect that of the situation of the economy we're facing as I speak.

    Sometimes the timing of a film's release is so accidentally perfect that it captures the mood of the public and becomes a hit. Such a film is The Full Monty. Made on a meagre budget of &pound;3 million, this small Sheffield-set comedy-drama went to achieve unprecedented commercial and critical success. It became the highest grossing film to that point at the UK box office; was nominated for the prestigious Best Picture Oscar (losing out to Titanic); and scooped several BAFTAs including Best Film and Best Actor for Robert Carlyle. A fine haul indeed for a modest little production set in a run-down neighbourhood of the steel city. Struggling ex-steelworkers Gaz (Robert Carlyle) and Dave (Mark Addy) spend their days breaking into shut-down steel mills searching for scrap metal to steal and sell. Sometimes they are joined by Gaz's son Nathan (William Snape), his child from a broken relationship with ex-wife Mandy (Emily Woof). One day Gaz notices a number of women entering a local social club and discovers that they are going to watch a male strip show. He hits upon the idea of raising a little money by putting on his own show. Enlisting other unemployed desperadoes like his former manager Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), ex-security guard Lomper (Steve Huison), smooth mover Horse (Paul Barber) and well-endowed hunk Guy (Hugo Speer), the unlikely lotharios set about practising their dance moves and perfecting a raunchy routine. The stakes are upped considerably when some women spot the lads putting up posters to advertise their show. When the women laugh off their ambitious scheme, Gaz decides to up the ante by telling them they will be going "the Full Monty" (fully naked). "Nobody said anything to me about the Full Monty!" gasps Horse, but his protests come too late the word is already out and the guys have a 400-strong audience of baying women to satisfy. In truth, The Full Monty could quite easily have turned up as a feature length TV-style drama - at first glance it certainly isn't an especially cinematic sort of film (e.g. a film that belongs on the big screen). Thanks to Simon Beaufoy's cracking script and the game performances, it transcends its small roots to become a thoroughly enjoyable story indeed. Performances that stand out include Carlyle as the desperate Gaz, Addy as the terribly self-conscious and overweight Dave, and Wilkinson as their once-proud manager, now reduced to teaching a bunch of 'commoners' to dance (as well as joining them in their potentially humiliating enterprise). Most of the performances are strong right down the cast list, but these three are a notch ahead of the rest. The dialogue is often very funny and the grim locations add to the film's sense of social deprivation and desperation. Like most comedies, repeat viewings gradually diminish the film's humour and freshness but first time round it is a vastly entertaining film, successfully managing to generate a feel-good atmosphere within its grimmest of settings. Director Peter Cattaneo never really pushed on after The Full Monty  to date he has only made three other features (none of which match the giddy heights of this one). It's a shame that he hasn't been able to capitalise on such a phenomenally successful debut. As Yorkshire-based cinema goes, The Full Monty is the most successful film ever to have come out of the region. It's also one of the best.

    I am not somebody who has any problems with dirty humor or is too prude to watch a movie with a sexual plot. And yet I am very impressed how they managed to take the storyline about men becoming strippers and produce a movie that is so sweet and in a way innocent. I am even surprised it was R rated. The reason is that we get to know the characters from their vulnerable side. We can see their desperation that drives them to this decision and we can feel their insecurities. I don't want to make it sound as if it is some tear jerker, it is not. In fact it is a very funny movie, but at the same time it has so much humanity. The best scenes in the movie are the auditions and practice scenes. Hilarious. I definitely recommend this movie. It is funny, light hearted and with great acting. But people who have the same problem as me in understanding accents should make sure they have captions on.

    The thing that stands out about this movie is that it seemed to have brought a new phrase into the English language, and that is "going the full monty." Generally it means to take off all of your clothes, but in another way it simply means going all of the way. One thing is true, not many movies can claim to have had an impact on the English language, but this one has. Now, the concept of a movie about male strippers doesn't really appeal to me. One would expect it to be rated R, but it is not. The ratings say that it contains nudity, but for an M rating all you can expect to see is bare bums, and yes that is what you do see. The Full Monty is actually about much more than simple male strippers: it is about self pride, image, unemployment, and simple trust. It is a movie with a lot of depth but is also quite funny. The Full Monty is set in the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire, England. The movie opens with an expose on Sheffield being a boom town with the steel industry, but 25 years later the steel mill has closed down and the city is suffering from high unemployment. This seems to be a common idea that runs through English television  the bleakness of life and the hopelessness of unemployment. I remember before the last English election when the Conservative Party lost to the Labour Party, that they interviewed people in some of the English towns where unemployment was very high, and the people had simply lost hope. So has it happened in this movie: people have lost hope to the point where they no longer wish to live. But there is hope on the horizon: Gaz and Dave, the main characters, sneak into a female only strip show and realise that these guys are getting paid ten pounds a head to simply take off their cloths. This gives Gaz an idea: he has much more than these guys, and he is willing to go the Full Monty, so why not get involved. So he and Dave get some people together to become male strippers with them. I expected the movie to be about them going on the nightclub circuit, becoming really famous, and then loosing everything: but it is not the case. Rather it is about the relationships between the people and the work the do to get to the strip show at the end. It is about their pride and overcoming it to humiliate themselves in front of a lot of ladies. It is also about how they try to hide this from everybody to save themselves the embarrassment. It seems that hiding things from people is another aspect of this movie. Dave hides the fact that he is becoming a male stripper from his wife, thinking that she is going to deride him because he is over weight. The truth is, she really doesn't care. She don't care if he is overweight: she loves him the way he is and she doesn't care if he goes the full monty. Then there is Dave and Gaz's former foreman. He has been unemployed for six months, yet he is ashamed of it and keeps this from his wife. As such she continues to go obliviously spending as if he were still working. She still has her dreams of going skiing. In the end, when she finds out, her quote is "I can handle the television being reposed, but what I cannot stand is that you kept this from me." This relationship is one on assumptions. The partners assume to much about each other and discover that in the end they really don't know that much about each other at all. The shame of stripping against the shame of being unemployed is what really runs through this movie. There is the bleakness of Job Club and the dole queue, lightened up by the strippers starting to dance to a song playing over the radio. Then there is the shame that they face when they are caught practicing in an abandoned factory. Not only do they face a mocking police force, but also the story hits the front page, and everybody knows. But then, they discovered that this newspaper article is the best advertising they could have got. The Full Monty is much better that I originally expected. It is not simply a movie about male strippers, but about the characters that they are and the struggles that they face trying to find a niche in society. Rather than being a movie that one compromises on when trying to find one at a video store, it should be one that is on the too see list.

    "The Full Monty" is a good-hearted comedy that the cynical nineties were begging for, and its Britain again that surprises the world with something new, fresh, pleasant and that could appeal to the whole family, despite some adult undertones. Overall, despite the adult material (hot) stuff, there is a sweet innocence mixed with the very inspirational message that every average Joe can have chance to do something different and be, a night long, THE big star, applauded and cheered by a crowd of roaring women. It's a celebration of optimism and trust in out deepest fantasies with the touch of realism that the movie needed so we wouldn't forget that these men do it for money, more than recognition. And this is an important element because it keeps the identification process with the protagonist totally intact. The casting is ideal because it shows every range of masculine adult demography, old, young, father, single, with neither racial nor sexual orientations' prejudices, so everyone can relate to them. It's a film that reconciles the public with the idea that men can also be targeted by the evolution of society, consumption society that advertises the image of clean-cut faces and muscular bodies with the same zealous marketing as for women's tits and sexy legs. Average men suffer from a tacit rejection, because basically, every time, their women, or for that matter, the women they'd like to be with, are confronted to messages indirectly shouting: "They are unemployed, ugly, lazy, they are losers". "The Full Monty" is a comedic response to a very serious social issue and the kindheartedness of the film proves that humor sometimes can be the best weapon to deal with rejection. Comedic tones still have these particularities that they're not meant to be taken seriously, but I think what makes the best comedies is precisely the ability to make people laugh and move them at the same time. Even screwball comedies can be exasperating if they don't let you catch your breath and appreciate some sensitivity. And this is the strength of "The Full Monty", being able to tell us very touching separate stories that will all converge to a same need: having a job, making money, being respected. I said 'respected' and not 'admired' because 'admiration' would be taking itself too seriously and the suspension of disbelief wouldn't work. The stories are centered on three men who all used to work in the steel factory which is to Sheffield (England) what the Nuclear Power Plant is to "The Simpsons"' Springfield, before the economical crisis, before unemployment, a problem still relevant today. Robert Carlyle, who played the demented Begbie in "Trainspotting" is in a totally opposite role as the leader of the group, Gaz, who'll encourage his buddies to 'do it', to prove that they're not an endangered species, that they are the real men. Mark Addy is Dave, his best friend, a lovable teddy bear of a guy who doesn't trust his wife, not even himself, he's the kind of character you want to put near you just to show him the film and how people really think about him, he could have been annoying if he didn't have so many qualities, among them, loyalty, kindness and a heart as big as his belly. And Gerald is the older and wiser man, who supervised them in the factory before unemployment. He's the one who practices dance and can help to produce the miracle. Three more men will join the group, and the only one to know about the secret is Nathan, Gaz's son, his inspiration to show that he's better than what her mother, and her new husband say. The film doesn't avoid some stereotypical situations but it would be unfair to criticize that, since the newness relies on the show these guys will do, the Chippendales, and no other movie did that before. And even when Chippendales did it, it wasn't "The Full Monty". And no other movie dealt with male nudity, with sexiness, with "Hot Stuff" in a light-hearted tone. The script is surely one of the movie's main strengths, because the strip-tease aspect is only a plot device, the point is elsewhere, it's about proving value. I won't develop that subject because all I need is to copy-paste everything I said about "Rocky", but there's indeed a "Rocky" feeling in this picture, where the prize to win is respect and self-respect. And this creates a double empathy from male public first, but also women who can finally see their men, boyfriends as the unsung heroes of everyday's life. I loved David with his girl, Jeannie, they were not particularly handsome, but there was a genuine love going between them. Gee, I would have loved to see them after the show, if this movie was 5 minutes longer, just something of the aftermath, but I guess their satisfactions and the cheers of the public had enough eloquence. And let's not forget that this is still a comedy, and the whole preparation of the show lead to so many memorable scenes especially the one in the Agency, where all the guys tap their feet to Donna Summer's iconic rhythm, probably one of the most gimmicky scenes of the 90's, not to mention the hilarious scenes that kept enough class not to reach certain limits. Where other movies would have probably displayed nude images, old women screaming, or other distastefully displays of raunchy humor, "The Full Monty" tackles it with a gentleness, that probably helped the film to reach a wider audience, be a popular success, and nominated to the Oscars. Definitely, one of the best of the 90's!

    Six men who were laid off when their Yorkshire steel mill closed are desperate for money. When a one-night Chippendales show comes to town and is a big hit, they decide to make their own strip show, and to make it more interesting, they'll go completely nude! The men are neither big and buff nor good dancers, but they put their hearts into preparing for the big night. This absolutely charming comedy has many touching moments, thanks to the well-developed and sympathetic characters we come to know: One is a divorced dad (Robert Carlyle) who needs to raise child support money, one is an overweight and depressed husband (Mark Addy), one cares for his aging mum, and one (Tom Wilkinson) hasn't had the nerve to tell his credit card-happy wife that he's been unemployed for six months. All of the actors are perfectly cast and it's worth the price just to see the venerable Wilkinson bump and grind to "Hot Stuff." Gritty location photography and a lively, Oscar-winning disco soundtrack help create the mood of despair giving way to hope. The North country accents and slang are sometimes unintelligible, but that in no way detracts from the fun. This fast-paced and sweet film made with a tiny budget went on to break UK box office records. Highly recommended.

    One of the more infamous British films to cross the Atlantic during the last decade and a half, "The Full Monty" was a monster success in its homeland, and was also successful in the US (and garnered four Oscar nods, including a win for Best Original Score). I'm actually surprised that it did so well. There are some appealing moments found during the 91 minute running time, but overall it's actually kind of dull. It's meant to be a breezy and amiable flick, but for a movie with such low (but earnest) ambitions, it doesn't succeed. Unemployed and out of money, Gaz (Robert Carlyle) is desperate. His son doesn't want to stay with him because his house is too cold, and he's late on his child support payments. His friends are not much better off. Then Gaz sees a Chippendales show (well, more specifically, the tons of ladies who are in the audience). That gives him an idea. If Chippendales dancers can make that much money by hiding the money shot, then think about how much money they could make if they went all the way! The movie is just too low-key to really be anything substantial. Granted, as I said, "The Full Monty" never tries to do anything groundbreaking, but we need something to keep us engaged. Apart from a few nice performances (particularly by Robert Carlyle, who's taken a successful change of pace by playing a nice, earnest guy instead of a creepy psycho), the film doesn't do that. But what really annoyed me is that the whole film is all about them going all the way, but the film doesn't have the guts to to the same. There's very little nudity, and save for one scene, the camera never shows us anything. I'm not saying that the film would have been better had they shown the guys doing "the full monty," but that's an apt description for the film. It lacks courage. Movies that want to be easy going and fancy free need to let everything flow naturally. Seeing as the Brits are among the least antsy about showing sex and nudity on screen, my thinking is that this was edited by the MPAA to avoid an NC-17 rating, or it was filmed that way in the hopes of getting a less strict rating (not that it worked...the film received an undeserved R rating). This isn't a terrible film, but it's just not that great either. My rating: PG-13 for language and brief nudity.

    The Full Monty came out in 1997 with a small four million dollar budget and grossed more than forty million dollars at the US box office and also was nominated for four academy awards including best picture. More than ten years later, it rightfully obtains its cult status. The movie is set in the famous steel making town of Sheffield, England. So once people start loosing their jobs, six unemployed factory workers (Gaz,Gerald, Dave, Nathan Lomper, and Horse) decide to become male strippers, much to the disapproval of their families. Gaz is divorced and wants full custody of his son. Gerald is lying to his wife, telling her that they can go on vacation, but he has no money, and needs the job. Dave is depressed and thinks his wife is cheating on him. Horse is an aging break dancer and wants to be back on top. Lomper is suicidal and needs something to believe in and Nathan is obsessed with Singin' In The Rain. They all decide to perform the full Monty-or completely nude. The story is simple, and feel good, but also rather predictable. But the outcome does not matter when the ride is so much fun. The Full Monty: *** stars

    In the 1970's, Sheffield, England was a booming city that had a very uplifting economy and steel was the hottest staple that came out at that time as a public relations informer told me. By the 1990's came around, due to lack of funding, a lot of the steel mills were sadly foreclosed. Unemployment was on the rise, people had to seek jobs elsewhere and those who have built their reputation in these companies struggled to adapt to either menial jobs or just plain stayed home and just collected welfare checks. Gaz (Robert Carlyle "Once Upon A Time") who's a divorced man lost custody to his teenage son as his wife found another man, who happens to be more financially secure than him. He continues to make sporadic visits on occasion to see his son Nathan (Willian Snape), but goes beyond as he makes Nathan a close companion. Desperate for money, Gaz finds a way he can make a substantial amount of cash. After hearing about a group of male strippers called the Chippendales come to town they seem to make a rather handsome profit in a rented hall that's usually packed. Gaz along with his friend Dave (Mark Addy) believe they could make the same amount by putting on a similar show. The only problem is that the gentlemen they recruit to bare their all are just average looking people, not the same type of prim and dashing individuals that are the Chippendales. And what's even worse is that their dancing skills are even worst than me (which is bad because I'm in theatre). The rest of the ragtag wannabe strippers include a former factory foreman Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), and a drifter named Horse (Paul Barber) who in spite of a bad hip is able to teach them a few moves. What's very curious to me is why in the world would these women be interested in seeing not so good-looking guys take their clothes off after getting much satisfaction from the Chippendales? Gaz suggests that they might get the upper hand if they're brave enough to go the full monty by baring all. The whole idea was trashed from the start as they fear that their bodies just don't have that mass appeal to get ladies the attention as one fears he's too skinny, the other fears he's too obese and the other is just too old to bear all. In all seriousness, "The Full Monty" touches on issues about finding work and that even though it's great and rewarding to have a job, there's always a possibility that the company you work for will not be around forever. And when you lose that job because of foreclosure you feel like everything you have done was all for nought. Sheffield is the primarily example of a once sprawling city where the power balance between men and women were abolished because men in that town were unable to provide for their families. Gerald who has not had a job in six months has been lying to his wife. But when he could no longer provide for his family, his wife wants him to break up. This might have happened in Gaz's situation with his wife before the movie takes off. The film closely links Dave's insecurities is to do anything to avoid becoming jobless. In fact the closest relationship is with Dave and his wife. The cast is entirely British and most people who live on North American soil may not be familiar to this group of relative unknowns. Carlyle is probably best known for his role as Mr. Gold (Rumpelstiltskin) from the TV series "Once Upon a Time", but even though he is the leading performer here, his performance is not the best one here. The real standouts are Addy's Dave and Wilkinson's Gerald. We root for the men not because they're bearing their gifts to the ladies, but because these men are trying to win back their livelihood so they could become more employable. Wilkinson seems to be the most comfortable of the trio, but his opportunities are quite scarce and it shows. Too bad that Paul Barber's Horse doesn't get much airtime. He seemed more energetic of the characters but there was not much story to make him more developed. "The Full Monty" is one of many films to feature the poor state of the British economy In some ways it's a bit of an homage to "Brassed Off". Even the brass band featured in a dire situation in an early scene was just pure irony. But it's still a good comedy and even though it's over-the-top in content, the situation the characters face are real and may reflect that of the situation of the economy we're facing as I speak.

    Sometimes the timing of a film's release is so accidentally perfect that it captures the mood of the public and becomes a hit. Such a film is The Full Monty. Made on a meagre budget of &pound;3 million, this small Sheffield-set comedy-drama went to achieve unprecedented commercial and critical success. It became the highest grossing film to that point at the UK box office; was nominated for the prestigious Best Picture Oscar (losing out to Titanic); and scooped several BAFTAs including Best Film and Best Actor for Robert Carlyle. A fine haul indeed for a modest little production set in a run-down neighbourhood of the steel city. Struggling ex-steelworkers Gaz (Robert Carlyle) and Dave (Mark Addy) spend their days breaking into shut-down steel mills searching for scrap metal to steal and sell. Sometimes they are joined by Gaz's son Nathan (William Snape), his child from a broken relationship with ex-wife Mandy (Emily Woof). One day Gaz notices a number of women entering a local social club and discovers that they are going to watch a male strip show. He hits upon the idea of raising a little money by putting on his own show. Enlisting other unemployed desperadoes like his former manager Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), ex-security guard Lomper (Steve Huison), smooth mover Horse (Paul Barber) and well-endowed hunk Guy (Hugo Speer), the unlikely lotharios set about practising their dance moves and perfecting a raunchy routine. The stakes are upped considerably when some women spot the lads putting up posters to advertise their show. When the women laugh off their ambitious scheme, Gaz decides to up the ante by telling them they will be going "the Full Monty" (fully naked). "Nobody said anything to me about the Full Monty!" gasps Horse, but his protests come too late the word is already out and the guys have a 400-strong audience of baying women to satisfy. In truth, The Full Monty could quite easily have turned up as a feature length TV-style drama - at first glance it certainly isn't an especially cinematic sort of film (e.g. a film that belongs on the big screen). Thanks to Simon Beaufoy's cracking script and the game performances, it transcends its small roots to become a thoroughly enjoyable story indeed. Performances that stand out include Carlyle as the desperate Gaz, Addy as the terribly self-conscious and overweight Dave, and Wilkinson as their once-proud manager, now reduced to teaching a bunch of 'commoners' to dance (as well as joining them in their potentially humiliating enterprise). Most of the performances are strong right down the cast list, but these three are a notch ahead of the rest. The dialogue is often very funny and the grim locations add to the film's sense of social deprivation and desperation. Like most comedies, repeat viewings gradually diminish the film's humour and freshness but first time round it is a vastly entertaining film, successfully managing to generate a feel-good atmosphere within its grimmest of settings. Director Peter Cattaneo never really pushed on after The Full Monty  to date he has only made three other features (none of which match the giddy heights of this one). It's a shame that he hasn't been able to capitalise on such a phenomenally successful debut. As Yorkshire-based cinema goes, The Full Monty is the most successful film ever to have come out of the region. It's also one of the best.

    I am not somebody who has any problems with dirty humor or is too prude to watch a movie with a sexual plot. And yet I am very impressed how they managed to take the storyline about men becoming strippers and produce a movie that is so sweet and in a way innocent. I am even surprised it was R rated. The reason is that we get to know the characters from their vulnerable side. We can see their desperation that drives them to this decision and we can feel their insecurities. I don't want to make it sound as if it is some tear jerker, it is not. In fact it is a very funny movie, but at the same time it has so much humanity. The best scenes in the movie are the auditions and practice scenes. Hilarious. I definitely recommend this movie. It is funny, light hearted and with great acting. But people who have the same problem as me in understanding accents should make sure they have captions on.

    The thing that stands out about this movie is that it seemed to have brought a new phrase into the English language, and that is "going the full monty." Generally it means to take off all of your clothes, but in another way it simply means going all of the way. One thing is true, not many movies can claim to have had an impact on the English language, but this one has. Now, the concept of a movie about male strippers doesn't really appeal to me. One would expect it to be rated R, but it is not. The ratings say that it contains nudity, but for an M rating all you can expect to see is bare bums, and yes that is what you do see. The Full Monty is actually about much more than simple male strippers: it is about self pride, image, unemployment, and simple trust. It is a movie with a lot of depth but is also quite funny. The Full Monty is set in the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire, England. The movie opens with an expose on Sheffield being a boom town with the steel industry, but 25 years later the steel mill has closed down and the city is suffering from high unemployment. This seems to be a common idea that runs through English television  the bleakness of life and the hopelessness of unemployment. I remember before the last English election when the Conservative Party lost to the Labour Party, that they interviewed people in some of the English towns where unemployment was very high, and the people had simply lost hope. So has it happened in this movie: people have lost hope to the point where they no longer wish to live. But there is hope on the horizon: Gaz and Dave, the main characters, sneak into a female only strip show and realise that these guys are getting paid ten pounds a head to simply take off their cloths. This gives Gaz an idea: he has much more than these guys, and he is willing to go the Full Monty, so why not get involved. So he and Dave get some people together to become male strippers with them. I expected the movie to be about them going on the nightclub circuit, becoming really famous, and then loosing everything: but it is not the case. Rather it is about the relationships between the people and the work the do to get to the strip show at the end. It is about their pride and overcoming it to humiliate themselves in front of a lot of ladies. It is also about how they try to hide this from everybody to save themselves the embarrassment. It seems that hiding things from people is another aspect of this movie. Dave hides the fact that he is becoming a male stripper from his wife, thinking that she is going to deride him because he is over weight. The truth is, she really doesn't care. She don't care if he is overweight: she loves him the way he is and she doesn't care if he goes the full monty. Then there is Dave and Gaz's former foreman. He has been unemployed for six months, yet he is ashamed of it and keeps this from his wife. As such she continues to go obliviously spending as if he were still working. She still has her dreams of going skiing. In the end, when she finds out, her quote is "I can handle the television being reposed, but what I cannot stand is that you kept this from me." This relationship is one on assumptions. The partners assume to much about each other and discover that in the end they really don't know that much about each other at all. The shame of stripping against the shame of being unemployed is what really runs through this movie. There is the bleakness of Job Club and the dole queue, lightened up by the strippers starting to dance to a song playing over the radio. Then there is the shame that they face when they are caught practicing in an abandoned factory. Not only do they face a mocking police force, but also the story hits the front page, and everybody knows. But then, they discovered that this newspaper article is the best advertising they could have got. The Full Monty is much better that I originally expected. It is not simply a movie about male strippers, but about the characters that they are and the struggles that they face trying to find a niche in society. Rather than being a movie that one compromises on when trying to find one at a video store, it should be one that is on the too see list.

    "The Full Monty" is a good-hearted comedy that the cynical nineties were begging for, and its Britain again that surprises the world with something new, fresh, pleasant and that could appeal to the whole family, despite some adult undertones. Overall, despite the adult material (hot) stuff, there is a sweet innocence mixed with the very inspirational message that every average Joe can have chance to do something different and be, a night long, THE big star, applauded and cheered by a crowd of roaring women. It's a celebration of optimism and trust in out deepest fantasies with the touch of realism that the movie needed so we wouldn't forget that these men do it for money, more than recognition. And this is an important element because it keeps the identification process with the protagonist totally intact. The casting is ideal because it shows every range of masculine adult demography, old, young, father, single, with neither racial nor sexual orientations' prejudices, so everyone can relate to them. It's a film that reconciles the public with the idea that men can also be targeted by the evolution of society, consumption society that advertises the image of clean-cut faces and muscular bodies with the same zealous marketing as for women's tits and sexy legs. Average men suffer from a tacit rejection, because basically, every time, their women, or for that matter, the women they'd like to be with, are confronted to messages indirectly shouting: "They are unemployed, ugly, lazy, they are losers". "The Full Monty" is a comedic response to a very serious social issue and the kindheartedness of the film proves that humor sometimes can be the best weapon to deal with rejection. Comedic tones still have these particularities that they're not meant to be taken seriously, but I think what makes the best comedies is precisely the ability to make people laugh and move them at the same time. Even screwball comedies can be exasperating if they don't let you catch your breath and appreciate some sensitivity. And this is the strength of "The Full Monty", being able to tell us very touching separate stories that will all converge to a same need: having a job, making money, being respected. I said 'respected' and not 'admired' because 'admiration' would be taking itself too seriously and the suspension of disbelief wouldn't work. The stories are centered on three men who all used to work in the steel factory which is to Sheffield (England) what the Nuclear Power Plant is to "The Simpsons"' Springfield, before the economical crisis, before unemployment, a problem still relevant today. Robert Carlyle, who played the demented Begbie in "Trainspotting" is in a totally opposite role as the leader of the group, Gaz, who'll encourage his buddies to 'do it', to prove that they're not an endangered species, that they are the real men. Mark Addy is Dave, his best friend, a lovable teddy bear of a guy who doesn't trust his wife, not even himself, he's the kind of character you want to put near you just to show him the film and how people really think about him, he could have been annoying if he didn't have so many qualities, among them, loyalty, kindness and a heart as big as his belly. And Gerald is the older and wiser man, who supervised them in the factory before unemployment. He's the one who practices dance and can help to produce the miracle. Three more men will join the group, and the only one to know about the secret is Nathan, Gaz's son, his inspiration to show that he's better than what her mother, and her new husband say. The film doesn't avoid some stereotypical situations but it would be unfair to criticize that, since the newness relies on the show these guys will do, the Chippendales, and no other movie did that before. And even when Chippendales did it, it wasn't "The Full Monty". And no other movie dealt with male nudity, with sexiness, with "Hot Stuff" in a light-hearted tone. The script is surely one of the movie's main strengths, because the strip-tease aspect is only a plot device, the point is elsewhere, it's about proving value. I won't develop that subject because all I need is to copy-paste everything I said about "Rocky", but there's indeed a "Rocky" feeling in this picture, where the prize to win is respect and self-respect. And this creates a double empathy from male public first, but also women who can finally see their men, boyfriends as the unsung heroes of everyday's life. I loved David with his girl, Jeannie, they were not particularly handsome, but there was a genuine love going between them. Gee, I would have loved to see them after the show, if this movie was 5 minutes longer, just something of the aftermath, but I guess their satisfactions and the cheers of the public had enough eloquence. And let's not forget that this is still a comedy, and the whole preparation of the show lead to so many memorable scenes especially the one in the Agency, where all the guys tap their feet to Donna Summer's iconic rhythm, probably one of the most gimmicky scenes of the 90's, not to mention the hilarious scenes that kept enough class not to reach certain limits. Where other movies would have probably displayed nude images, old women screaming, or other distastefully displays of raunchy humor, "The Full Monty" tackles it with a gentleness, that probably helped the film to reach a wider audience, be a popular success, and nominated to the Oscars. Definitely, one of the best of the 90's!

    Six men who were laid off when their Yorkshire steel mill closed are desperate for money. When a one-night Chippendales show comes to town and is a big hit, they decide to make their own strip show, and to make it more interesting, they'll go completely nude! The men are neither big and buff nor good dancers, but they put their hearts into preparing for the big night. This absolutely charming comedy has many touching moments, thanks to the well-developed and sympathetic characters we come to know: One is a divorced dad (Robert Carlyle) who needs to raise child support money, one is an overweight and depressed husband (Mark Addy), one cares for his aging mum, and one (Tom Wilkinson) hasn't had the nerve to tell his credit card-happy wife that he's been unemployed for six months. All of the actors are perfectly cast and it's worth the price just to see the venerable Wilkinson bump and grind to "Hot Stuff." Gritty location photography and a lively, Oscar-winning disco soundtrack help create the mood of despair giving way to hope. The North country accents and slang are sometimes unintelligible, but that in no way detracts from the fun. This fast-paced and sweet film made with a tiny budget went on to break UK box office records. Highly recommended.

    One of the more infamous British films to cross the Atlantic during the last decade and a half, "The Full Monty" was a monster success in its homeland, and was also successful in the US (and garnered four Oscar nods, including a win for Best Original Score). I'm actually surprised that it did so well. There are some appealing moments found during the 91 minute running time, but overall it's actually kind of dull. It's meant to be a breezy and amiable flick, but for a movie with such low (but earnest) ambitions, it doesn't succeed. Unemployed and out of money, Gaz (Robert Carlyle) is desperate. His son doesn't want to stay with him because his house is too cold, and he's late on his child support payments. His friends are not much better off. Then Gaz sees a Chippendales show (well, more specifically, the tons of ladies who are in the audience). That gives him an idea. If Chippendales dancers can make that much money by hiding the money shot, then think about how much money they could make if they went all the way! The movie is just too low-key to really be anything substantial. Granted, as I said, "The Full Monty" never tries to do anything groundbreaking, but we need something to keep us engaged. Apart from a few nice performances (particularly by Robert Carlyle, who's taken a successful change of pace by playing a nice, earnest guy instead of a creepy psycho), the film doesn't do that. But what really annoyed me is that the whole film is all about them going all the way, but the film doesn't have the guts to to the same. There's very little nudity, and save for one scene, the camera never shows us anything. I'm not saying that the film would have been better had they shown the guys doing "the full monty," but that's an apt description for the film. It lacks courage. Movies that want to be easy going and fancy free need to let everything flow naturally. Seeing as the Brits are among the least antsy about showing sex and nudity on screen, my thinking is that this was edited by the MPAA to avoid an NC-17 rating, or it was filmed that way in the hopes of getting a less strict rating (not that it worked...the film received an undeserved R rating). This isn't a terrible film, but it's just not that great either. My rating: PG-13 for language and brief nudity.
