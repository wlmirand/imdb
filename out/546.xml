 <sinopse>
  Terrorists steal nuclear warheads from the US military but don't count on a pilot and park ranger spoiling their plans.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  "Broken Arrow" is the term used to describe a nuclear device that has been lost. In this movie, two nuclear missiles are stolen by rogue US pilot Deakins, but hot on his trail is his co-pilot Hale and a Park Ranger, Terry. The action takes place in Utah's canyon country; a high stakes game of cat and mouse.

    Warning Will Robinson. Spoilers dead ahead! Things you can learn from this film: 1) Nuclear bombs come with timing devices. 2) 6 minutes is all the time you'll need to escape a nuclear blast if you have a convenient underground river handy. 3) If you have a getaway helicopter on flatbed railway car and someone blows it up the train will be perfectly fine. It won't derail or anything. In fact you can have Christian Slater hiding directly under the thing and he'll be okay too! 4) If you steal a nuclear warhead the US government will mobilize one stupid helicopter to try and stop you. Not a battalion, not a platoon, just one helicopter and a guy with an assault rifle. Action flicks must walk a fine line between spectacle and plausibility. If the script and the director pile up too many "oh-come-on" moments in a film they risk losing the audience. This flick has a pile of "oh-come-ons" the size of K2. On the other hand, even if the production staff has gone overboard on the nonsense a movie can still be salvaged by some engaging performances on the part of its stars. Broken Arrow fails in this department too. Christian Slater plays Christian Slater and John Travolta hams it up to the point of becoming "you want to punch him in his face" annoying. He chews the scenery so badly that he gives Jack Nicholson's Joker in Tim Burton's Batman a run for his money. The film has the gloss and sheen that you would expect from well-budgeted Hollywood product but there is honestly nothing that goes on in it's 108 minute duration that is worth your time and effort. For Godsake, whatever you do, do not spend money on this piece of tripe. You'll just end up feeling foolish in the end.

    This is one of the best movie John Woo's made in Hollywood. Broken Arrow of course refers to a lost nuclear bomb, but it's not really lost in this case, it was stolen. One terrorist (Travolta) and two soldiers (Slater, Mathis) chase across the desert to capture the bomb. The concept has never been explored before in a movie, and the plot works very well. Cocky Travolta, and the desperate Slater makes a good combination that brings this movie to the exciting climax. John Woo's clean style worked well in this movie, along with Slater's gritty performance. It's a different kind of an action movie, but is worth watching because of performance by Slater, Woo, and Travolta.

    Despite this being a 1996 action movie, it is actually still fun to watch today, some odd 16 years later. Sure it is a very predictable movie in every aspect, but still fun to watch. The story is fairly straight forward, an air-force officer (played by John Travolta) goes bad and steals two nuclear missiles during a test flight, bent on revenge for being passed over on promotions again and again. His co-pilot (played by Christian Slater) must stop his former commanding officer and prevent a nuclear disaster from happening in USA, and he gets help from a park ranger (played by Samantha Mathis). There is nothing innovating or groundbreaking in this movie or its storyline. It is pretty much a run-of-the-mill late 90's stereotypical action movie. I will say that both Slater and Travolta actually did well enough in this movie, and that comes even as I am not a particular fan of neither of them. Nothing extraordinary, though, but still good enough performances all-round. For a John Woo movie, there is less action, actually, that what you'd get from his Hong Kong produced movies. By that, I don't mean there is action in "Broken Arrow", because there is, but unlike the Hong Kong movies John Woo is known for, the action is on a different scale. It is a step up from the individual action from the protagonists to a more grander scale, e.g. military. So it is a matter of personal preference what you prefer. Personally, I am more lenient towards John Woo's Hong Kong movies, as there is just a grittier and more violent approach to them. There is a good amount of explosions and good pyrotechnics in this movie, which worked quite well in favor for the movie. Lots of things get blown up in a stylish way. So if you like explosions, you are in for a treat here. "Broken Arrow" is fairly mindless action, in the sense that you just unhook your brain and sit back in the couch and enjoy the action ride, because right from the very beginning you already know how the movie will turn out and end. Despite it being predictable to the core, the ending always makes me laugh. You just have to see that!

    I've seen criticism of this film for its over the top plot, dodgy acting and poor dialogue. None of that has stopped me watching it about 5-6 times. For me the acting is well done. It's not amazing and no its not Travoltas best ever, but every time he wanders onto the screen with that little bit of Hans Zimmer music playing... You can't wait to see what he does next. I also love the one liners. They are pretty corny, but they are good corny. The plot, yes its outlandish and silly but that is the type of movie this is. If you can sit back, shut off and just enjoy the fast action then this is a great watch.

    Stupid hackneyed movie, totally not worth your 105 minutes. The plot pops out of nowhere, "experienced" ex-Marines shooting away like stormtroopers, nuclear devices that can be turned ON and OFF by chubby little keypads and remote controls, which looks way too cute even for your sister's TV. Travolta overacts while the Slater keeps flashing his charming smile like this is some silent movie. Even Woo was aware this movie had nothing going for it, that is why he kept putting in the awesome soundtrack wherever he could. Hans Zimmer has done a great job on the track, it had me pausing the movie and rushing to try it out on my guitar. Manthis does a good job, but then again she was underwritten, also no explanations as to how a park ranger has such rad martial arts skills. And lets not even go the part where Slater lets her do the risky stuff and goes off to the authorities for help. Seriously, don't watch it.

    There's no denying that in order to make it in Hollywood, John Woo had to abandon much of what made his Hong Kong films so special: a unique blend of emotional characterisation combined with themes of loyalty and honour and outrageous over-the-top violence. That said, I still get a kick out of Broken Arrow, the director's second US effort: the plot might be your typically dumb US action nonsense, full of glaring plot holes, but the film still displays enough of Woo's cool visual style and expertly choreographed action to make it a cut above the competition. Working with big Hollywood stars and a massive budget, Woo pulls off some ridiculously outrageous comic-book action, building to a glorious orgy of violence aboard a speeding train carrying a live nuclear device to Denver, with only fighter pilot Capt. Riley Hale (Christian Slater) and park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis) to save the day. None of what precedes this silly scenario makes much sense, but check your brain at the door before viewing and you'll have a blast with the brilliantly choreographed hyper-kinetic gun-play, impressive stunt sequences, massive explosions, and John Travolta's absolutely bonkers performance.

    When somebody doesn't like a movie they really do try to pull out every bad mistake it in. After reading Ebert's review of Broken Arrow I have come to realise that he is a brainless moron that just raves on for a long time. I still think that his reviews are a little deeper, but I think that he was a little too scathing on Broken Arrow. Anyway, if the film was that bad, why did he give it a 2 out of 4 and not a 0 like he did to North. Broken Arrow is a simple action film about a man that steals two nuclear bombs and uses them to blackmail the government. This movie basically contains four helicopters blowing up, a young park ranger who happens to be a woman, and lots of machine gun fights. This is not a bad thing, but compared to Woo's Hong Kong movies, Broken Arrow does not make the grade. The only interesting character is Deakins (John Travolta) who turns traitor after twenty years in the airforce and being over looked so many times for promotion. Hale (Christian Slater) is Deakins' co-pilot and is like a younger brother to Deakins. Deakins knows all about Hale and thus is able to predict every move of his. This make is a little interesting. The interesting thing about Deakins is that we begin by not know what he really is like. We think that Deakins and Hale will be the bad guys, but then we discover that he is the force behind the theft of the bombs and that our original impression was not correct. Beyond that the characters are fairly shallow and don't even seem to show the depth that the characters in Woo's Hong Kong movies and Face Off seem to have. This just reinforces my belief that John Woo's best movies are the ones he writes himself.

    The only reason this movie is worth watching is because of John Travolta, who is at his absolute funniest, as far as I'm concerned. Basically, Broken Arrow is a combination of good, solid action and some great Travolta scenes & one-liners. The girl is OK, Slater just plain annoying. As far as the story goes: the very average storyline you'd expect in an action movie like this, although I would rate the terrible plot below average even for this kind of movie. All in all, definitely worth watching if you can ignore the last 10 minutes. Must see if you're a Travolta fan, in my opinion.

    This John Woo action thriller reunites Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis, who played very different characters in 'Pump Up the Volume, as US Air Force pilot Captain Riley Hale and Park Ranger Terry Carmichael who find themselves in a race against time to prevent Hale's erstwhile colleague Major Vic Deakins, played by John Travolta, from getting away with two nuclear warheads he has stolen after staging a crash in the desert. Over the course of the film there is almost constant action as the two officers struggle for possession of the weapons this means plenty of shootouts, car chases, fights and exploding helicopters! The plot may have a few holes in it and if one thinks about it for too long there are plenty of unlikely occurrences but that doesn't matter as the action seldom lets up and that action is always stylish as one would expect from former Honk Kong Action supreme John Woo. Slater and Travolta are great as the two airmen; particularly the latter as is often the case the villain gets the best lines. Samantha Mathis puts in a feisty performance as the Park Ranger who finds herself dragged into helping Hale after she finds him in the desert following him being force to eject from the plane. The action is accompanied be a good sound track from Hans Zimmer; the music is never over the top but fits perfectly with the stylish action. Those people used to John Woo's earlier works such as 'The Killer' and 'Hard Boiled' might find the action here relatively tame but I enjoyed it and heartily recommend it to those looking for a fun action thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously.

    Broken Arrow is directed by John Woo and written by Graham Yost. It stars John Travolta, Christian Slater, Samantha Mathis, Delroy Lindo, Bob Gunton and Howie Long. Hans Zimmer scores the music and Peter Levy is director of photography. Vic Deakins (Travolta) and Riley Hale (Slater), two air force friends, about to become enemies as one of them goes rogue and steals two nuclear missiles. Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a Broken Arrow, and America is in danger. John Woo berserker with Travolta going over the top. OK, lets not be too judgemental about such things, but expecting anything less than no brain explosive cinema is tantamount to stupidity. That said, even the blockiest of action blockbusters should have some sort of character depth from which the audience can begin to be involved with. Broken Arrow doesn't have that, Woo and Yost forgo such things and just launch into an hour and forty five minutes of adrenalin rushes, set around a good guy versus bad guy premise: with Samantha Mathis dragged along side the good guy for the token female interest. The absence of any wit in the script is particularly galling, especially since Travolta's mugging cries out for some corny throw away lines. But for action seekers, at least, Broken Arrow is undeniably good trashy fun. Woo knows how to string action sequences together, and he also has this knack of making gun-play and carnage almost balletic. Cast wise it's best just to buy into Travolta enjoying himself, but Slater you sense is taking it all far too serious. Mathis is admirable given the scant flesh written onto her characters bones, while Gunton and Lindo are badly underused. Zimmer's score is part Western, part Octane, and Levy's (and his team) photography around Utah's scorched vista's is very accomplished and easy on the eye. Don't think about it too much and the discerning action fan should enjoy it. 6.5/10

    Broken Arrow is directed by John Woo and written by Graham Yost. It stars John Travolta, Christian Slater, Samantha Mathis, Delroy Lindo, Bob Gunton and Howie Long. Hans Zimmer scores the music and Peter Levy is director of photography. Vic Deakins (Travolta) and Riley Hale (Slater), two air force friends, about to become enemies as one of them goes rogue and steals two nuclear missiles. Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a Broken Arrow, and America is in danger. John Woo berserker with Travolta going over the top. OK, lets not be too judgemental about such things, but expecting anything less than no brain explosive cinema is tantamount to stupidity. That said, even the blockiest of action blockbusters should have some sort of character depth from which the audience can begin to be involved with. Broken Arrow doesn't have that, Woo and Yost forgo such things and just launch into an hour and forty five minutes of adrenalin rushes, set around a good guy versus bad guy premise: with Samantha Mathis dragged along side the good guy for the token female interest. The absence of any wit in the script is particularly galling, especially since Travolta's mugging cries out for some corny throw away lines. But for action seekers, at least, Broken Arrow is undeniably good trashy fun. Woo knows how to string action sequences together, and he also has this knack of making gun-play and carnage almost balletic. Cast wise it's best just to buy into Travolta enjoying himself, but Slater you sense is taking it all far too serious. Mathis is admirable given the scant flesh written onto her characters bones, while Gunton and Lindo are badly underused. Zimmer's score is part Western, part Octane, and Levy's (and his team) photography around Utah's scorched vista's is very accomplished and easy on the eye. Don't think about it too much and the discerning action fan should enjoy it. 6.5/10

    Warning Will Robinson. Spoilers dead ahead! Things you can learn from this film: 1) Nuclear bombs come with timing devices. 2) 6 minutes is all the time you'll need to escape a nuclear blast if you have a convenient underground river handy. 3) If you have a getaway helicopter on flatbed railway car and someone blows it up the train will be perfectly fine. It won't derail or anything. In fact you can have Christian Slater hiding directly under the thing and he'll be okay too! 4) If you steal a nuclear warhead the US government will mobilize one stupid helicopter to try and stop you. Not a battalion, not a platoon, just one helicopter and a guy with an assault rifle. Action flicks must walk a fine line between spectacle and plausibility. If the script and the director pile up too many "oh-come-on" moments in a film they risk losing the audience. This flick has a pile of "oh-come-ons" the size of K2. On the other hand, even if the production staff has gone overboard on the nonsense a movie can still be salvaged by some engaging performances on the part of its stars. Broken Arrow fails in this department too. Christian Slater plays Christian Slater and John Travolta hams it up to the point of becoming "you want to punch him in his face" annoying. He chews the scenery so badly that he gives Jack Nicholson's Joker in Tim Burton's Batman a run for his money. The film has the gloss and sheen that you would expect from well-budgeted Hollywood product but there is honestly nothing that goes on in it's 108 minute duration that is worth your time and effort. For Godsake, whatever you do, do not spend money on this piece of tripe. You'll just end up feeling foolish in the end.

    This is one of the best movie John Woo's made in Hollywood. Broken Arrow of course refers to a lost nuclear bomb, but it's not really lost in this case, it was stolen. One terrorist (Travolta) and two soldiers (Slater, Mathis) chase across the desert to capture the bomb. The concept has never been explored before in a movie, and the plot works very well. Cocky Travolta, and the desperate Slater makes a good combination that brings this movie to the exciting climax. John Woo's clean style worked well in this movie, along with Slater's gritty performance. It's a different kind of an action movie, but is worth watching because of performance by Slater, Woo, and Travolta.

    Despite this being a 1996 action movie, it is actually still fun to watch today, some odd 16 years later. Sure it is a very predictable movie in every aspect, but still fun to watch. The story is fairly straight forward, an air-force officer (played by John Travolta) goes bad and steals two nuclear missiles during a test flight, bent on revenge for being passed over on promotions again and again. His co-pilot (played by Christian Slater) must stop his former commanding officer and prevent a nuclear disaster from happening in USA, and he gets help from a park ranger (played by Samantha Mathis). There is nothing innovating or groundbreaking in this movie or its storyline. It is pretty much a run-of-the-mill late 90's stereotypical action movie. I will say that both Slater and Travolta actually did well enough in this movie, and that comes even as I am not a particular fan of neither of them. Nothing extraordinary, though, but still good enough performances all-round. For a John Woo movie, there is less action, actually, that what you'd get from his Hong Kong produced movies. By that, I don't mean there is action in "Broken Arrow", because there is, but unlike the Hong Kong movies John Woo is known for, the action is on a different scale. It is a step up from the individual action from the protagonists to a more grander scale, e.g. military. So it is a matter of personal preference what you prefer. Personally, I am more lenient towards John Woo's Hong Kong movies, as there is just a grittier and more violent approach to them. There is a good amount of explosions and good pyrotechnics in this movie, which worked quite well in favor for the movie. Lots of things get blown up in a stylish way. So if you like explosions, you are in for a treat here. "Broken Arrow" is fairly mindless action, in the sense that you just unhook your brain and sit back in the couch and enjoy the action ride, because right from the very beginning you already know how the movie will turn out and end. Despite it being predictable to the core, the ending always makes me laugh. You just have to see that!

    I've seen criticism of this film for its over the top plot, dodgy acting and poor dialogue. None of that has stopped me watching it about 5-6 times. For me the acting is well done. It's not amazing and no its not Travoltas best ever, but every time he wanders onto the screen with that little bit of Hans Zimmer music playing... You can't wait to see what he does next. I also love the one liners. They are pretty corny, but they are good corny. The plot, yes its outlandish and silly but that is the type of movie this is. If you can sit back, shut off and just enjoy the fast action then this is a great watch.

    Stupid hackneyed movie, totally not worth your 105 minutes. The plot pops out of nowhere, "experienced" ex-Marines shooting away like stormtroopers, nuclear devices that can be turned ON and OFF by chubby little keypads and remote controls, which looks way too cute even for your sister's TV. Travolta overacts while the Slater keeps flashing his charming smile like this is some silent movie. Even Woo was aware this movie had nothing going for it, that is why he kept putting in the awesome soundtrack wherever he could. Hans Zimmer has done a great job on the track, it had me pausing the movie and rushing to try it out on my guitar. Manthis does a good job, but then again she was underwritten, also no explanations as to how a park ranger has such rad martial arts skills. And lets not even go the part where Slater lets her do the risky stuff and goes off to the authorities for help. Seriously, don't watch it.

    There's no denying that in order to make it in Hollywood, John Woo had to abandon much of what made his Hong Kong films so special: a unique blend of emotional characterisation combined with themes of loyalty and honour and outrageous over-the-top violence. That said, I still get a kick out of Broken Arrow, the director's second US effort: the plot might be your typically dumb US action nonsense, full of glaring plot holes, but the film still displays enough of Woo's cool visual style and expertly choreographed action to make it a cut above the competition. Working with big Hollywood stars and a massive budget, Woo pulls off some ridiculously outrageous comic-book action, building to a glorious orgy of violence aboard a speeding train carrying a live nuclear device to Denver, with only fighter pilot Capt. Riley Hale (Christian Slater) and park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis) to save the day. None of what precedes this silly scenario makes much sense, but check your brain at the door before viewing and you'll have a blast with the brilliantly choreographed hyper-kinetic gun-play, impressive stunt sequences, massive explosions, and John Travolta's absolutely bonkers performance.

    When somebody doesn't like a movie they really do try to pull out every bad mistake it in. After reading Ebert's review of Broken Arrow I have come to realise that he is a brainless moron that just raves on for a long time. I still think that his reviews are a little deeper, but I think that he was a little too scathing on Broken Arrow. Anyway, if the film was that bad, why did he give it a 2 out of 4 and not a 0 like he did to North. Broken Arrow is a simple action film about a man that steals two nuclear bombs and uses them to blackmail the government. This movie basically contains four helicopters blowing up, a young park ranger who happens to be a woman, and lots of machine gun fights. This is not a bad thing, but compared to Woo's Hong Kong movies, Broken Arrow does not make the grade. The only interesting character is Deakins (John Travolta) who turns traitor after twenty years in the airforce and being over looked so many times for promotion. Hale (Christian Slater) is Deakins' co-pilot and is like a younger brother to Deakins. Deakins knows all about Hale and thus is able to predict every move of his. This make is a little interesting. The interesting thing about Deakins is that we begin by not know what he really is like. We think that Deakins and Hale will be the bad guys, but then we discover that he is the force behind the theft of the bombs and that our original impression was not correct. Beyond that the characters are fairly shallow and don't even seem to show the depth that the characters in Woo's Hong Kong movies and Face Off seem to have. This just reinforces my belief that John Woo's best movies are the ones he writes himself.

    The only reason this movie is worth watching is because of John Travolta, who is at his absolute funniest, as far as I'm concerned. Basically, Broken Arrow is a combination of good, solid action and some great Travolta scenes & one-liners. The girl is OK, Slater just plain annoying. As far as the story goes: the very average storyline you'd expect in an action movie like this, although I would rate the terrible plot below average even for this kind of movie. All in all, definitely worth watching if you can ignore the last 10 minutes. Must see if you're a Travolta fan, in my opinion.

    This John Woo action thriller reunites Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis, who played very different characters in 'Pump Up the Volume, as US Air Force pilot Captain Riley Hale and Park Ranger Terry Carmichael who find themselves in a race against time to prevent Hale's erstwhile colleague Major Vic Deakins, played by John Travolta, from getting away with two nuclear warheads he has stolen after staging a crash in the desert. Over the course of the film there is almost constant action as the two officers struggle for possession of the weapons this means plenty of shootouts, car chases, fights and exploding helicopters! The plot may have a few holes in it and if one thinks about it for too long there are plenty of unlikely occurrences but that doesn't matter as the action seldom lets up and that action is always stylish as one would expect from former Honk Kong Action supreme John Woo. Slater and Travolta are great as the two airmen; particularly the latter as is often the case the villain gets the best lines. Samantha Mathis puts in a feisty performance as the Park Ranger who finds herself dragged into helping Hale after she finds him in the desert following him being force to eject from the plane. The action is accompanied be a good sound track from Hans Zimmer; the music is never over the top but fits perfectly with the stylish action. Those people used to John Woo's earlier works such as 'The Killer' and 'Hard Boiled' might find the action here relatively tame but I enjoyed it and heartily recommend it to those looking for a fun action thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously.

    Broken Arrow is directed by John Woo and written by Graham Yost. It stars John Travolta, Christian Slater, Samantha Mathis, Delroy Lindo, Bob Gunton and Howie Long. Hans Zimmer scores the music and Peter Levy is director of photography. Vic Deakins (Travolta) and Riley Hale (Slater), two air force friends, about to become enemies as one of them goes rogue and steals two nuclear missiles. Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a Broken Arrow, and America is in danger. John Woo berserker with Travolta going over the top. OK, lets not be too judgemental about such things, but expecting anything less than no brain explosive cinema is tantamount to stupidity. That said, even the blockiest of action blockbusters should have some sort of character depth from which the audience can begin to be involved with. Broken Arrow doesn't have that, Woo and Yost forgo such things and just launch into an hour and forty five minutes of adrenalin rushes, set around a good guy versus bad guy premise: with Samantha Mathis dragged along side the good guy for the token female interest. The absence of any wit in the script is particularly galling, especially since Travolta's mugging cries out for some corny throw away lines. But for action seekers, at least, Broken Arrow is undeniably good trashy fun. Woo knows how to string action sequences together, and he also has this knack of making gun-play and carnage almost balletic. Cast wise it's best just to buy into Travolta enjoying himself, but Slater you sense is taking it all far too serious. Mathis is admirable given the scant flesh written onto her characters bones, while Gunton and Lindo are badly underused. Zimmer's score is part Western, part Octane, and Levy's (and his team) photography around Utah's scorched vista's is very accomplished and easy on the eye. Don't think about it too much and the discerning action fan should enjoy it. 6.5/10

    Warning Will Robinson. Spoilers dead ahead! Things you can learn from this film: 1) Nuclear bombs come with timing devices. 2) 6 minutes is all the time you'll need to escape a nuclear blast if you have a convenient underground river handy. 3) If you have a getaway helicopter on flatbed railway car and someone blows it up the train will be perfectly fine. It won't derail or anything. In fact you can have Christian Slater hiding directly under the thing and he'll be okay too! 4) If you steal a nuclear warhead the US government will mobilize one stupid helicopter to try and stop you. Not a battalion, not a platoon, just one helicopter and a guy with an assault rifle. Action flicks must walk a fine line between spectacle and plausibility. If the script and the director pile up too many "oh-come-on" moments in a film they risk losing the audience. This flick has a pile of "oh-come-ons" the size of K2. On the other hand, even if the production staff has gone overboard on the nonsense a movie can still be salvaged by some engaging performances on the part of its stars. Broken Arrow fails in this department too. Christian Slater plays Christian Slater and John Travolta hams it up to the point of becoming "you want to punch him in his face" annoying. He chews the scenery so badly that he gives Jack Nicholson's Joker in Tim Burton's Batman a run for his money. The film has the gloss and sheen that you would expect from well-budgeted Hollywood product but there is honestly nothing that goes on in it's 108 minute duration that is worth your time and effort. For Godsake, whatever you do, do not spend money on this piece of tripe. You'll just end up feeling foolish in the end.

    This is one of the best movie John Woo's made in Hollywood. Broken Arrow of course refers to a lost nuclear bomb, but it's not really lost in this case, it was stolen. One terrorist (Travolta) and two soldiers (Slater, Mathis) chase across the desert to capture the bomb. The concept has never been explored before in a movie, and the plot works very well. Cocky Travolta, and the desperate Slater makes a good combination that brings this movie to the exciting climax. John Woo's clean style worked well in this movie, along with Slater's gritty performance. It's a different kind of an action movie, but is worth watching because of performance by Slater, Woo, and Travolta.

    Despite this being a 1996 action movie, it is actually still fun to watch today, some odd 16 years later. Sure it is a very predictable movie in every aspect, but still fun to watch. The story is fairly straight forward, an air-force officer (played by John Travolta) goes bad and steals two nuclear missiles during a test flight, bent on revenge for being passed over on promotions again and again. His co-pilot (played by Christian Slater) must stop his former commanding officer and prevent a nuclear disaster from happening in USA, and he gets help from a park ranger (played by Samantha Mathis). There is nothing innovating or groundbreaking in this movie or its storyline. It is pretty much a run-of-the-mill late 90's stereotypical action movie. I will say that both Slater and Travolta actually did well enough in this movie, and that comes even as I am not a particular fan of neither of them. Nothing extraordinary, though, but still good enough performances all-round. For a John Woo movie, there is less action, actually, that what you'd get from his Hong Kong produced movies. By that, I don't mean there is action in "Broken Arrow", because there is, but unlike the Hong Kong movies John Woo is known for, the action is on a different scale. It is a step up from the individual action from the protagonists to a more grander scale, e.g. military. So it is a matter of personal preference what you prefer. Personally, I am more lenient towards John Woo's Hong Kong movies, as there is just a grittier and more violent approach to them. There is a good amount of explosions and good pyrotechnics in this movie, which worked quite well in favor for the movie. Lots of things get blown up in a stylish way. So if you like explosions, you are in for a treat here. "Broken Arrow" is fairly mindless action, in the sense that you just unhook your brain and sit back in the couch and enjoy the action ride, because right from the very beginning you already know how the movie will turn out and end. Despite it being predictable to the core, the ending always makes me laugh. You just have to see that!

    I've seen criticism of this film for its over the top plot, dodgy acting and poor dialogue. None of that has stopped me watching it about 5-6 times. For me the acting is well done. It's not amazing and no its not Travoltas best ever, but every time he wanders onto the screen with that little bit of Hans Zimmer music playing... You can't wait to see what he does next. I also love the one liners. They are pretty corny, but they are good corny. The plot, yes its outlandish and silly but that is the type of movie this is. If you can sit back, shut off and just enjoy the fast action then this is a great watch.

    Stupid hackneyed movie, totally not worth your 105 minutes. The plot pops out of nowhere, "experienced" ex-Marines shooting away like stormtroopers, nuclear devices that can be turned ON and OFF by chubby little keypads and remote controls, which looks way too cute even for your sister's TV. Travolta overacts while the Slater keeps flashing his charming smile like this is some silent movie. Even Woo was aware this movie had nothing going for it, that is why he kept putting in the awesome soundtrack wherever he could. Hans Zimmer has done a great job on the track, it had me pausing the movie and rushing to try it out on my guitar. Manthis does a good job, but then again she was underwritten, also no explanations as to how a park ranger has such rad martial arts skills. And lets not even go the part where Slater lets her do the risky stuff and goes off to the authorities for help. Seriously, don't watch it.

    There's no denying that in order to make it in Hollywood, John Woo had to abandon much of what made his Hong Kong films so special: a unique blend of emotional characterisation combined with themes of loyalty and honour and outrageous over-the-top violence. That said, I still get a kick out of Broken Arrow, the director's second US effort: the plot might be your typically dumb US action nonsense, full of glaring plot holes, but the film still displays enough of Woo's cool visual style and expertly choreographed action to make it a cut above the competition. Working with big Hollywood stars and a massive budget, Woo pulls off some ridiculously outrageous comic-book action, building to a glorious orgy of violence aboard a speeding train carrying a live nuclear device to Denver, with only fighter pilot Capt. Riley Hale (Christian Slater) and park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis) to save the day. None of what precedes this silly scenario makes much sense, but check your brain at the door before viewing and you'll have a blast with the brilliantly choreographed hyper-kinetic gun-play, impressive stunt sequences, massive explosions, and John Travolta's absolutely bonkers performance.

    When somebody doesn't like a movie they really do try to pull out every bad mistake it in. After reading Ebert's review of Broken Arrow I have come to realise that he is a brainless moron that just raves on for a long time. I still think that his reviews are a little deeper, but I think that he was a little too scathing on Broken Arrow. Anyway, if the film was that bad, why did he give it a 2 out of 4 and not a 0 like he did to North. Broken Arrow is a simple action film about a man that steals two nuclear bombs and uses them to blackmail the government. This movie basically contains four helicopters blowing up, a young park ranger who happens to be a woman, and lots of machine gun fights. This is not a bad thing, but compared to Woo's Hong Kong movies, Broken Arrow does not make the grade. The only interesting character is Deakins (John Travolta) who turns traitor after twenty years in the airforce and being over looked so many times for promotion. Hale (Christian Slater) is Deakins' co-pilot and is like a younger brother to Deakins. Deakins knows all about Hale and thus is able to predict every move of his. This make is a little interesting. The interesting thing about Deakins is that we begin by not know what he really is like. We think that Deakins and Hale will be the bad guys, but then we discover that he is the force behind the theft of the bombs and that our original impression was not correct. Beyond that the characters are fairly shallow and don't even seem to show the depth that the characters in Woo's Hong Kong movies and Face Off seem to have. This just reinforces my belief that John Woo's best movies are the ones he writes himself.

    The only reason this movie is worth watching is because of John Travolta, who is at his absolute funniest, as far as I'm concerned. Basically, Broken Arrow is a combination of good, solid action and some great Travolta scenes & one-liners. The girl is OK, Slater just plain annoying. As far as the story goes: the very average storyline you'd expect in an action movie like this, although I would rate the terrible plot below average even for this kind of movie. All in all, definitely worth watching if you can ignore the last 10 minutes. Must see if you're a Travolta fan, in my opinion.

    This John Woo action thriller reunites Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis, who played very different characters in 'Pump Up the Volume, as US Air Force pilot Captain Riley Hale and Park Ranger Terry Carmichael who find themselves in a race against time to prevent Hale's erstwhile colleague Major Vic Deakins, played by John Travolta, from getting away with two nuclear warheads he has stolen after staging a crash in the desert. Over the course of the film there is almost constant action as the two officers struggle for possession of the weapons this means plenty of shootouts, car chases, fights and exploding helicopters! The plot may have a few holes in it and if one thinks about it for too long there are plenty of unlikely occurrences but that doesn't matter as the action seldom lets up and that action is always stylish as one would expect from former Honk Kong Action supreme John Woo. Slater and Travolta are great as the two airmen; particularly the latter as is often the case the villain gets the best lines. Samantha Mathis puts in a feisty performance as the Park Ranger who finds herself dragged into helping Hale after she finds him in the desert following him being force to eject from the plane. The action is accompanied be a good sound track from Hans Zimmer; the music is never over the top but fits perfectly with the stylish action. Those people used to John Woo's earlier works such as 'The Killer' and 'Hard Boiled' might find the action here relatively tame but I enjoyed it and heartily recommend it to those looking for a fun action thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously.

    Broken Arrow is directed by John Woo and written by Graham Yost. It stars John Travolta, Christian Slater, Samantha Mathis, Delroy Lindo, Bob Gunton and Howie Long. Hans Zimmer scores the music and Peter Levy is director of photography. Vic Deakins (Travolta) and Riley Hale (Slater), two air force friends, about to become enemies as one of them goes rogue and steals two nuclear missiles. Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a Broken Arrow, and America is in danger. John Woo berserker with Travolta going over the top. OK, lets not be too judgemental about such things, but expecting anything less than no brain explosive cinema is tantamount to stupidity. That said, even the blockiest of action blockbusters should have some sort of character depth from which the audience can begin to be involved with. Broken Arrow doesn't have that, Woo and Yost forgo such things and just launch into an hour and forty five minutes of adrenalin rushes, set around a good guy versus bad guy premise: with Samantha Mathis dragged along side the good guy for the token female interest. The absence of any wit in the script is particularly galling, especially since Travolta's mugging cries out for some corny throw away lines. But for action seekers, at least, Broken Arrow is undeniably good trashy fun. Woo knows how to string action sequences together, and he also has this knack of making gun-play and carnage almost balletic. Cast wise it's best just to buy into Travolta enjoying himself, but Slater you sense is taking it all far too serious. Mathis is admirable given the scant flesh written onto her characters bones, while Gunton and Lindo are badly underused. Zimmer's score is part Western, part Octane, and Levy's (and his team) photography around Utah's scorched vista's is very accomplished and easy on the eye. Don't think about it too much and the discerning action fan should enjoy it. 6.5/10

    Warning Will Robinson. Spoilers dead ahead! Things you can learn from this film: 1) Nuclear bombs come with timing devices. 2) 6 minutes is all the time you'll need to escape a nuclear blast if you have a convenient underground river handy. 3) If you have a getaway helicopter on flatbed railway car and someone blows it up the train will be perfectly fine. It won't derail or anything. In fact you can have Christian Slater hiding directly under the thing and he'll be okay too! 4) If you steal a nuclear warhead the US government will mobilize one stupid helicopter to try and stop you. Not a battalion, not a platoon, just one helicopter and a guy with an assault rifle. Action flicks must walk a fine line between spectacle and plausibility. If the script and the director pile up too many "oh-come-on" moments in a film they risk losing the audience. This flick has a pile of "oh-come-ons" the size of K2. On the other hand, even if the production staff has gone overboard on the nonsense a movie can still be salvaged by some engaging performances on the part of its stars. Broken Arrow fails in this department too. Christian Slater plays Christian Slater and John Travolta hams it up to the point of becoming "you want to punch him in his face" annoying. He chews the scenery so badly that he gives Jack Nicholson's Joker in Tim Burton's Batman a run for his money. The film has the gloss and sheen that you would expect from well-budgeted Hollywood product but there is honestly nothing that goes on in it's 108 minute duration that is worth your time and effort. For Godsake, whatever you do, do not spend money on this piece of tripe. You'll just end up feeling foolish in the end.

    This is one of the best movie John Woo's made in Hollywood. Broken Arrow of course refers to a lost nuclear bomb, but it's not really lost in this case, it was stolen. One terrorist (Travolta) and two soldiers (Slater, Mathis) chase across the desert to capture the bomb. The concept has never been explored before in a movie, and the plot works very well. Cocky Travolta, and the desperate Slater makes a good combination that brings this movie to the exciting climax. John Woo's clean style worked well in this movie, along with Slater's gritty performance. It's a different kind of an action movie, but is worth watching because of performance by Slater, Woo, and Travolta.

    Despite this being a 1996 action movie, it is actually still fun to watch today, some odd 16 years later. Sure it is a very predictable movie in every aspect, but still fun to watch. The story is fairly straight forward, an air-force officer (played by John Travolta) goes bad and steals two nuclear missiles during a test flight, bent on revenge for being passed over on promotions again and again. His co-pilot (played by Christian Slater) must stop his former commanding officer and prevent a nuclear disaster from happening in USA, and he gets help from a park ranger (played by Samantha Mathis). There is nothing innovating or groundbreaking in this movie or its storyline. It is pretty much a run-of-the-mill late 90's stereotypical action movie. I will say that both Slater and Travolta actually did well enough in this movie, and that comes even as I am not a particular fan of neither of them. Nothing extraordinary, though, but still good enough performances all-round. For a John Woo movie, there is less action, actually, that what you'd get from his Hong Kong produced movies. By that, I don't mean there is action in "Broken Arrow", because there is, but unlike the Hong Kong movies John Woo is known for, the action is on a different scale. It is a step up from the individual action from the protagonists to a more grander scale, e.g. military. So it is a matter of personal preference what you prefer. Personally, I am more lenient towards John Woo's Hong Kong movies, as there is just a grittier and more violent approach to them. There is a good amount of explosions and good pyrotechnics in this movie, which worked quite well in favor for the movie. Lots of things get blown up in a stylish way. So if you like explosions, you are in for a treat here. "Broken Arrow" is fairly mindless action, in the sense that you just unhook your brain and sit back in the couch and enjoy the action ride, because right from the very beginning you already know how the movie will turn out and end. Despite it being predictable to the core, the ending always makes me laugh. You just have to see that!

    I've seen criticism of this film for its over the top plot, dodgy acting and poor dialogue. None of that has stopped me watching it about 5-6 times. For me the acting is well done. It's not amazing and no its not Travoltas best ever, but every time he wanders onto the screen with that little bit of Hans Zimmer music playing... You can't wait to see what he does next. I also love the one liners. They are pretty corny, but they are good corny. The plot, yes its outlandish and silly but that is the type of movie this is. If you can sit back, shut off and just enjoy the fast action then this is a great watch.

    Stupid hackneyed movie, totally not worth your 105 minutes. The plot pops out of nowhere, "experienced" ex-Marines shooting away like stormtroopers, nuclear devices that can be turned ON and OFF by chubby little keypads and remote controls, which looks way too cute even for your sister's TV. Travolta overacts while the Slater keeps flashing his charming smile like this is some silent movie. Even Woo was aware this movie had nothing going for it, that is why he kept putting in the awesome soundtrack wherever he could. Hans Zimmer has done a great job on the track, it had me pausing the movie and rushing to try it out on my guitar. Manthis does a good job, but then again she was underwritten, also no explanations as to how a park ranger has such rad martial arts skills. And lets not even go the part where Slater lets her do the risky stuff and goes off to the authorities for help. Seriously, don't watch it.

    There's no denying that in order to make it in Hollywood, John Woo had to abandon much of what made his Hong Kong films so special: a unique blend of emotional characterisation combined with themes of loyalty and honour and outrageous over-the-top violence. That said, I still get a kick out of Broken Arrow, the director's second US effort: the plot might be your typically dumb US action nonsense, full of glaring plot holes, but the film still displays enough of Woo's cool visual style and expertly choreographed action to make it a cut above the competition. Working with big Hollywood stars and a massive budget, Woo pulls off some ridiculously outrageous comic-book action, building to a glorious orgy of violence aboard a speeding train carrying a live nuclear device to Denver, with only fighter pilot Capt. Riley Hale (Christian Slater) and park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis) to save the day. None of what precedes this silly scenario makes much sense, but check your brain at the door before viewing and you'll have a blast with the brilliantly choreographed hyper-kinetic gun-play, impressive stunt sequences, massive explosions, and John Travolta's absolutely bonkers performance.

    When somebody doesn't like a movie they really do try to pull out every bad mistake it in. After reading Ebert's review of Broken Arrow I have come to realise that he is a brainless moron that just raves on for a long time. I still think that his reviews are a little deeper, but I think that he was a little too scathing on Broken Arrow. Anyway, if the film was that bad, why did he give it a 2 out of 4 and not a 0 like he did to North. Broken Arrow is a simple action film about a man that steals two nuclear bombs and uses them to blackmail the government. This movie basically contains four helicopters blowing up, a young park ranger who happens to be a woman, and lots of machine gun fights. This is not a bad thing, but compared to Woo's Hong Kong movies, Broken Arrow does not make the grade. The only interesting character is Deakins (John Travolta) who turns traitor after twenty years in the airforce and being over looked so many times for promotion. Hale (Christian Slater) is Deakins' co-pilot and is like a younger brother to Deakins. Deakins knows all about Hale and thus is able to predict every move of his. This make is a little interesting. The interesting thing about Deakins is that we begin by not know what he really is like. We think that Deakins and Hale will be the bad guys, but then we discover that he is the force behind the theft of the bombs and that our original impression was not correct. Beyond that the characters are fairly shallow and don't even seem to show the depth that the characters in Woo's Hong Kong movies and Face Off seem to have. This just reinforces my belief that John Woo's best movies are the ones he writes himself.

    The only reason this movie is worth watching is because of John Travolta, who is at his absolute funniest, as far as I'm concerned. Basically, Broken Arrow is a combination of good, solid action and some great Travolta scenes & one-liners. The girl is OK, Slater just plain annoying. As far as the story goes: the very average storyline you'd expect in an action movie like this, although I would rate the terrible plot below average even for this kind of movie. All in all, definitely worth watching if you can ignore the last 10 minutes. Must see if you're a Travolta fan, in my opinion.

    This John Woo action thriller reunites Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis, who played very different characters in 'Pump Up the Volume, as US Air Force pilot Captain Riley Hale and Park Ranger Terry Carmichael who find themselves in a race against time to prevent Hale's erstwhile colleague Major Vic Deakins, played by John Travolta, from getting away with two nuclear warheads he has stolen after staging a crash in the desert. Over the course of the film there is almost constant action as the two officers struggle for possession of the weapons this means plenty of shootouts, car chases, fights and exploding helicopters! The plot may have a few holes in it and if one thinks about it for too long there are plenty of unlikely occurrences but that doesn't matter as the action seldom lets up and that action is always stylish as one would expect from former Honk Kong Action supreme John Woo. Slater and Travolta are great as the two airmen; particularly the latter as is often the case the villain gets the best lines. Samantha Mathis puts in a feisty performance as the Park Ranger who finds herself dragged into helping Hale after she finds him in the desert following him being force to eject from the plane. The action is accompanied be a good sound track from Hans Zimmer; the music is never over the top but fits perfectly with the stylish action. Those people used to John Woo's earlier works such as 'The Killer' and 'Hard Boiled' might find the action here relatively tame but I enjoyed it and heartily recommend it to those looking for a fun action thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously.

    Broken Arrow is directed by John Woo and written by Graham Yost. It stars John Travolta, Christian Slater, Samantha Mathis, Delroy Lindo, Bob Gunton and Howie Long. Hans Zimmer scores the music and Peter Levy is director of photography. Vic Deakins (Travolta) and Riley Hale (Slater), two air force friends, about to become enemies as one of them goes rogue and steals two nuclear missiles. Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a Broken Arrow, and America is in danger. John Woo berserker with Travolta going over the top. OK, lets not be too judgemental about such things, but expecting anything less than no brain explosive cinema is tantamount to stupidity. That said, even the blockiest of action blockbusters should have some sort of character depth from which the audience can begin to be involved with. Broken Arrow doesn't have that, Woo and Yost forgo such things and just launch into an hour and forty five minutes of adrenalin rushes, set around a good guy versus bad guy premise: with Samantha Mathis dragged along side the good guy for the token female interest. The absence of any wit in the script is particularly galling, especially since Travolta's mugging cries out for some corny throw away lines. But for action seekers, at least, Broken Arrow is undeniably good trashy fun. Woo knows how to string action sequences together, and he also has this knack of making gun-play and carnage almost balletic. Cast wise it's best just to buy into Travolta enjoying himself, but Slater you sense is taking it all far too serious. Mathis is admirable given the scant flesh written onto her characters bones, while Gunton and Lindo are badly underused. Zimmer's score is part Western, part Octane, and Levy's (and his team) photography around Utah's scorched vista's is very accomplished and easy on the eye. Don't think about it too much and the discerning action fan should enjoy it. 6.5/10

    Warning Will Robinson. Spoilers dead ahead! Things you can learn from this film: 1) Nuclear bombs come with timing devices. 2) 6 minutes is all the time you'll need to escape a nuclear blast if you have a convenient underground river handy. 3) If you have a getaway helicopter on flatbed railway car and someone blows it up the train will be perfectly fine. It won't derail or anything. In fact you can have Christian Slater hiding directly under the thing and he'll be okay too! 4) If you steal a nuclear warhead the US government will mobilize one stupid helicopter to try and stop you. Not a battalion, not a platoon, just one helicopter and a guy with an assault rifle. Action flicks must walk a fine line between spectacle and plausibility. If the script and the director pile up too many "oh-come-on" moments in a film they risk losing the audience. This flick has a pile of "oh-come-ons" the size of K2. On the other hand, even if the production staff has gone overboard on the nonsense a movie can still be salvaged by some engaging performances on the part of its stars. Broken Arrow fails in this department too. Christian Slater plays Christian Slater and John Travolta hams it up to the point of becoming "you want to punch him in his face" annoying. He chews the scenery so badly that he gives Jack Nicholson's Joker in Tim Burton's Batman a run for his money. The film has the gloss and sheen that you would expect from well-budgeted Hollywood product but there is honestly nothing that goes on in it's 108 minute duration that is worth your time and effort. For Godsake, whatever you do, do not spend money on this piece of tripe. You'll just end up feeling foolish in the end.

    This is one of the best movie John Woo's made in Hollywood. Broken Arrow of course refers to a lost nuclear bomb, but it's not really lost in this case, it was stolen. One terrorist (Travolta) and two soldiers (Slater, Mathis) chase across the desert to capture the bomb. The concept has never been explored before in a movie, and the plot works very well. Cocky Travolta, and the desperate Slater makes a good combination that brings this movie to the exciting climax. John Woo's clean style worked well in this movie, along with Slater's gritty performance. It's a different kind of an action movie, but is worth watching because of performance by Slater, Woo, and Travolta.

    Despite this being a 1996 action movie, it is actually still fun to watch today, some odd 16 years later. Sure it is a very predictable movie in every aspect, but still fun to watch. The story is fairly straight forward, an air-force officer (played by John Travolta) goes bad and steals two nuclear missiles during a test flight, bent on revenge for being passed over on promotions again and again. His co-pilot (played by Christian Slater) must stop his former commanding officer and prevent a nuclear disaster from happening in USA, and he gets help from a park ranger (played by Samantha Mathis). There is nothing innovating or groundbreaking in this movie or its storyline. It is pretty much a run-of-the-mill late 90's stereotypical action movie. I will say that both Slater and Travolta actually did well enough in this movie, and that comes even as I am not a particular fan of neither of them. Nothing extraordinary, though, but still good enough performances all-round. For a John Woo movie, there is less action, actually, that what you'd get from his Hong Kong produced movies. By that, I don't mean there is action in "Broken Arrow", because there is, but unlike the Hong Kong movies John Woo is known for, the action is on a different scale. It is a step up from the individual action from the protagonists to a more grander scale, e.g. military. So it is a matter of personal preference what you prefer. Personally, I am more lenient towards John Woo's Hong Kong movies, as there is just a grittier and more violent approach to them. There is a good amount of explosions and good pyrotechnics in this movie, which worked quite well in favor for the movie. Lots of things get blown up in a stylish way. So if you like explosions, you are in for a treat here. "Broken Arrow" is fairly mindless action, in the sense that you just unhook your brain and sit back in the couch and enjoy the action ride, because right from the very beginning you already know how the movie will turn out and end. Despite it being predictable to the core, the ending always makes me laugh. You just have to see that!

    I've seen criticism of this film for its over the top plot, dodgy acting and poor dialogue. None of that has stopped me watching it about 5-6 times. For me the acting is well done. It's not amazing and no its not Travoltas best ever, but every time he wanders onto the screen with that little bit of Hans Zimmer music playing... You can't wait to see what he does next. I also love the one liners. They are pretty corny, but they are good corny. The plot, yes its outlandish and silly but that is the type of movie this is. If you can sit back, shut off and just enjoy the fast action then this is a great watch.

    Stupid hackneyed movie, totally not worth your 105 minutes. The plot pops out of nowhere, "experienced" ex-Marines shooting away like stormtroopers, nuclear devices that can be turned ON and OFF by chubby little keypads and remote controls, which looks way too cute even for your sister's TV. Travolta overacts while the Slater keeps flashing his charming smile like this is some silent movie. Even Woo was aware this movie had nothing going for it, that is why he kept putting in the awesome soundtrack wherever he could. Hans Zimmer has done a great job on the track, it had me pausing the movie and rushing to try it out on my guitar. Manthis does a good job, but then again she was underwritten, also no explanations as to how a park ranger has such rad martial arts skills. And lets not even go the part where Slater lets her do the risky stuff and goes off to the authorities for help. Seriously, don't watch it.

    There's no denying that in order to make it in Hollywood, John Woo had to abandon much of what made his Hong Kong films so special: a unique blend of emotional characterisation combined with themes of loyalty and honour and outrageous over-the-top violence. That said, I still get a kick out of Broken Arrow, the director's second US effort: the plot might be your typically dumb US action nonsense, full of glaring plot holes, but the film still displays enough of Woo's cool visual style and expertly choreographed action to make it a cut above the competition. Working with big Hollywood stars and a massive budget, Woo pulls off some ridiculously outrageous comic-book action, building to a glorious orgy of violence aboard a speeding train carrying a live nuclear device to Denver, with only fighter pilot Capt. Riley Hale (Christian Slater) and park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis) to save the day. None of what precedes this silly scenario makes much sense, but check your brain at the door before viewing and you'll have a blast with the brilliantly choreographed hyper-kinetic gun-play, impressive stunt sequences, massive explosions, and John Travolta's absolutely bonkers performance.

    When somebody doesn't like a movie they really do try to pull out every bad mistake it in. After reading Ebert's review of Broken Arrow I have come to realise that he is a brainless moron that just raves on for a long time. I still think that his reviews are a little deeper, but I think that he was a little too scathing on Broken Arrow. Anyway, if the film was that bad, why did he give it a 2 out of 4 and not a 0 like he did to North. Broken Arrow is a simple action film about a man that steals two nuclear bombs and uses them to blackmail the government. This movie basically contains four helicopters blowing up, a young park ranger who happens to be a woman, and lots of machine gun fights. This is not a bad thing, but compared to Woo's Hong Kong movies, Broken Arrow does not make the grade. The only interesting character is Deakins (John Travolta) who turns traitor after twenty years in the airforce and being over looked so many times for promotion. Hale (Christian Slater) is Deakins' co-pilot and is like a younger brother to Deakins. Deakins knows all about Hale and thus is able to predict every move of his. This make is a little interesting. The interesting thing about Deakins is that we begin by not know what he really is like. We think that Deakins and Hale will be the bad guys, but then we discover that he is the force behind the theft of the bombs and that our original impression was not correct. Beyond that the characters are fairly shallow and don't even seem to show the depth that the characters in Woo's Hong Kong movies and Face Off seem to have. This just reinforces my belief that John Woo's best movies are the ones he writes himself.

    The only reason this movie is worth watching is because of John Travolta, who is at his absolute funniest, as far as I'm concerned. Basically, Broken Arrow is a combination of good, solid action and some great Travolta scenes & one-liners. The girl is OK, Slater just plain annoying. As far as the story goes: the very average storyline you'd expect in an action movie like this, although I would rate the terrible plot below average even for this kind of movie. All in all, definitely worth watching if you can ignore the last 10 minutes. Must see if you're a Travolta fan, in my opinion.

    This John Woo action thriller reunites Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis, who played very different characters in 'Pump Up the Volume, as US Air Force pilot Captain Riley Hale and Park Ranger Terry Carmichael who find themselves in a race against time to prevent Hale's erstwhile colleague Major Vic Deakins, played by John Travolta, from getting away with two nuclear warheads he has stolen after staging a crash in the desert. Over the course of the film there is almost constant action as the two officers struggle for possession of the weapons this means plenty of shootouts, car chases, fights and exploding helicopters! The plot may have a few holes in it and if one thinks about it for too long there are plenty of unlikely occurrences but that doesn't matter as the action seldom lets up and that action is always stylish as one would expect from former Honk Kong Action supreme John Woo. Slater and Travolta are great as the two airmen; particularly the latter as is often the case the villain gets the best lines. Samantha Mathis puts in a feisty performance as the Park Ranger who finds herself dragged into helping Hale after she finds him in the desert following him being force to eject from the plane. The action is accompanied be a good sound track from Hans Zimmer; the music is never over the top but fits perfectly with the stylish action. Those people used to John Woo's earlier works such as 'The Killer' and 'Hard Boiled' might find the action here relatively tame but I enjoyed it and heartily recommend it to those looking for a fun action thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously.

    Broken Arrow is directed by John Woo and written by Graham Yost. It stars John Travolta, Christian Slater, Samantha Mathis, Delroy Lindo, Bob Gunton and Howie Long. Hans Zimmer scores the music and Peter Levy is director of photography. Vic Deakins (Travolta) and Riley Hale (Slater), two air force friends, about to become enemies as one of them goes rogue and steals two nuclear missiles. Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a Broken Arrow, and America is in danger. John Woo berserker with Travolta going over the top. OK, lets not be too judgemental about such things, but expecting anything less than no brain explosive cinema is tantamount to stupidity. That said, even the blockiest of action blockbusters should have some sort of character depth from which the audience can begin to be involved with. Broken Arrow doesn't have that, Woo and Yost forgo such things and just launch into an hour and forty five minutes of adrenalin rushes, set around a good guy versus bad guy premise: with Samantha Mathis dragged along side the good guy for the token female interest. The absence of any wit in the script is particularly galling, especially since Travolta's mugging cries out for some corny throw away lines. But for action seekers, at least, Broken Arrow is undeniably good trashy fun. Woo knows how to string action sequences together, and he also has this knack of making gun-play and carnage almost balletic. Cast wise it's best just to buy into Travolta enjoying himself, but Slater you sense is taking it all far too serious. Mathis is admirable given the scant flesh written onto her characters bones, while Gunton and Lindo are badly underused. Zimmer's score is part Western, part Octane, and Levy's (and his team) photography around Utah's scorched vista's is very accomplished and easy on the eye. Don't think about it too much and the discerning action fan should enjoy it. 6.5/10
