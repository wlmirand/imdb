 <sinopse>
  Based on the true story of the First Jamacian bobsled team trying to make it to the winter olympics.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Irving Blitzer disgraced himself when putting extra weights into his team's bob in the Olympics, resulting in his gold medal being taken away from him. Years later, Derice Bannock, son to a former friend of Irv, fails to qualify for the 100-yard sprint for the Olympics due to a stupid accident. But when he hears of Irving Blitzer living also on Jamaica, Derice decides to go to the Games anyway, if not as a sprinter, then as a bobsledder. After some starting problems, the first Jamaican bobsledding team is formed and heads for Calgary. In the freezing weather Derice, Sanka, Junior and Yul are only laughed at, since nobody can take a Jamaican bobsledding team led by a disgraced trainer seriously. But team spirit and a healthy self confidence may lead to a few surprises in the upcoming Winter Games.

    Top casting, top acting, top script, photography, background musical score & direction. With established comedy actor John Candy(Uncle Buck, Planes Trains and Automobiles) and a solid supporting cast which includes Leon and Doug E. Doug. This film is loosely based on the true story of the Jamaica national bobsled team's debut in the bobsleigh competition of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Canada. Plot: Irving "Irv" Blitzer was an American bobsled two time Gold Medalist at the 1968 Winter Olympics who finished first in two events again during the 1972 Winter Olympics but was disqualified from the latter for cheating and retired in disgrace to Jamaica, where he leads an impoverished life as a bookie. Irving is approached by two Jamaican athletes: top 100m runner Derice Bannock, who failed to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympics when another opponent tripped him at the trials, and Sanka Coffie, a champion push cart racer. The athletes wish to use Irving's previous experience as a Coach in order to compete in the 1988 Winter Olympics as bobsledders. Irving had been good friends with Derice's father, Ben, a former sprinter whom Irving had tried to recruit for the bobsled team years ago, who is presumed to be deceased. Yul Brenner, another runner who was tripped at the qualifier, joins the team as does as Junior Bevil, the runner who tripped Yul and Derice. Eventually Irving is convinced to coach the team. The four try to find various ways to earn money to get in the Olympics; singing on the street, arm wrestling, and holding a kissing booth, but all fail. Junior, however, sells his car, which gets the team the money that they need. In Calgary, Irving manages to acquire an old practice sled from the American team, as the Jamaicans have never been in an actual bobsled. The Jamaicans are looked down upon by other countries, in particular the East German team whose arrogant leader, Josef, tells them to go home, resulting in a bar fight. The team resolves to view the contest more seriously, continuing to train and improve their technique. They qualify for the finals, but are briefly disqualified. At the primary judge meeting, Irving immediately confronts his former coach from the '72 Olympic Winter Games Kurt Hemphill, now a primary judge of the '88 Olympic Winter Games, for disqualifying the Jamaicans for his mistake. He confesses that he made the biggest mistake in his life by cheating by hiding weights underneath the sled to make it run faster. Irving's 1972 Gold Medals were revoked and he embarrassed his country with the scandal. He says that if Hemphill wants revenge, just punish him, not his team. He begs Hemphill to let the Jamaicans qualify and represent their country in the Olympics. Later, the judges overturn their decision and the Jamaicans are back in. The Jamaicans' first day on the track results in more embarrassment and a last place finish. Sanka convinces Derice to stop copying qualities of the Swiss team. Once the team develops their own style, the second day proves better; the Jamaican team finishes with a fast time which puts them in eighth position. Later, Irving tells Derice the truth about his past and convinces him to think of himself as a champion even if he doesn't win the gold, saying, "A gold medal is nice, but if you're not enough without one, you'll never be enough with one." For the first half of the final day's race it looks as though they will break the world bobsled speed record, until tragedy strikes: their sled, due to one of the blades falling off, flips on its side coming out of a turn towards the end of their run, leaving them meters short of the finish line. However, the team lifts the sled over their shoulders and walks across the finish line to rousing applause from spectators, including Josef, Hempill, and Junior's father. The team, at the end, feels accomplished enough to return in four years to the next winter Olympics. A brief epilogue states the team returned to Jamaica as heroes and upon their return to the Winter Olympics four years later, they were treated as equals. Completely unlike the story in the film, the Jamaican team was not in conflict with any of the other international bobsledding teams. Other teams were, in fact, supportive of the Jamaican team. One of the other teams even lent the Jamaican team a backup sled so they could qualify. The bobsled competition in the film consists of three individual runs, whereas in reality the Olympic bobsled competition is two runs a day held over a two day period. In the film, the Jamaicans are on world record pace during the final run of the competition when their sled crashes. They emerge from the sled and carry it across the finish line. In real life, however, the crash occurred before the finals (eliminating the Jamaicans) and Jamaica was not on a world record pace. However, real-life footage of the crash was used in the film. After the crash, the team walked next to their sled as track officials slid it down the track. They received sporadic applause, but not a rhythmic slow clap as in the movie Verdict: A MUST BUY FILM THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL ENJOY.

    This is a surprisingly inspiring and uplifting movie. Not like the pathetic, unnecessarily crass comedies released these days. I was only 3 when this came out, first time I watched it I was 8 I believe, and in the 14 years or so since I have watched this movie maybe 10 or so times. There are laugh out loud moments as well as frustrating ones, times that your eyes might get a little moist and at least a few instances when I've wanted to jump off my seat and cheer in front of the TV - even after all these years. This movie is truly a classic and deserves more recognition for how well written it is and for the talented actors who bring the script to life. BRILLIANT.

    John Candy is Irving Blitzer, a former Olympic medalist in the bobsledding, who was disgrace and stripped of his medals for cheating. He moved to Barbados and became a bookie. He meets a Jamaican sprinter named Derice, and a pushcart racer, Sanka, and they convince him to coach them for the Calgary Winter Olympics. Two more sprinters join the team and Irving acquires an old sled to practice with. They are mocked by the East German team, resulting in a bar fight. The team trains hard, and after struggling, finally qualify for the Olympics. John Candy is excellent as the affable coach, and the athletes, convincing as the bobsledders. The feel good Rocky, triumph over adversity story has been done many times, and Cool Runnings is one of the funnier ones.

    Cool Runnings. I first saw this film as a random watch because i was pretty bored on a Weekend afternoon. And boy, was I immediately hooked. It's one of those rare films that you could watch over and over again without getting tired of it, and that is really what i liked most about Cool Runnings. I also loved this movie because of the fact it was based on a true story. These movies always leave me wanting to know what actually happened in real life, if i didn't know already, which allowed me compare how close the feature was to the actual event. Apart from the characters having different names, the other parts were pretty much accurate, and that always gives a film a boosted rating from me. The plot was well put together as well in my eyes, mainly because the characters all seem to have fitted in with the storyline anyway. You could clearly see from the start who the 4 main characters were going to be, and it remained that way throughout. The characters themselves were perfectly casted, particularly Rawle D. Lewis (Junior Bevil. His ability to play his personality is an all-time favourite. The late John Candy was very good as Irv Blitzer as well. Overall this film is an all-time great, and will be for years to come. 5 stars ***** 10/10

    In one of John Candy last films and one I somehow missed to watch when released in 1993/94 (there was great hype surrounding it) it is certainly not one to be taken seriously but I can't recall a Candy movie that does. It is very loosely based on the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the Winter Olympics in 1988 and nowhere near a biography. In fact almost everything is fictional. And that's what makes it more fun. Candy stars a disgraced former bobsleigh gold medalist (now a bookie) tasked to coach a top 100m sprinter (Leon Robinson) and his motley crew to become the Jamaican representatives at the bobsleigh races at the Winter Olympics in Canada despite having inexperience in snowy weather. Hence all daft. childish and sometimes predictable mishaps on the way but never failing to raise a smile. All characters are likable and all the stereotypes are there: the intelligent one, the hard man, the wimp and the fool. Good cheesy family fun and that it is intended to be.

    There are a select few films that seem to resonate with everybody. I cannot remember anyone who had seen this that didn't enjoy it but somehow, it had escaped my attention until now. So forgive me if I'm a little late to the party but at least I now understand where you are all coming from. Yes, it's a Disney sport-based movie and yes, it hasn't dated that well in terms of effects (or fashions!). But there is a real charm, chemistry between the leads and genuine humour to it that lifts this above most other movies of this type. It's not quite "Rocky" but given a Jamaican twist and you're halfway there. Aspiring sprinter Derice (Leon) dreams of competing in the Olympics but at the trials, he is unfortunately tripped up by fellow competitor Junior (Rawle D. Lewis) and blows his chance. Initially distraught, he soon discovers that a legendary bobsleigh coach (John Candy) lives on Jamaica and decides to start competing in the Winter Olympics as part of Jamaica's first bobsled team. Recruiting his best friend Sanka (Doug E. Doug) and fellow sprinter Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), the five of them jet off to Calgary to compete despite the fact that they have no sled, no real exposure to the cold and the lack of acceptance from the other competitors. But bobsledding is about more than technique - it's about belief, friendship and not taking things too seriously. Anybody expecting a serious sports drama had better look elsewhere because "Cool Runnings" never takes itself seriously. In fact, the greatest compliment I can pay it is that for the most part, it never actually feels like a sports movie - mainly due to the comedy which is both funny and well-performed. With Candy being the only actor I recognise, the four leads acquit themselves very well alongside their heavyweight co-star, who seems to be lacking some of the spark that made him so watchable in the likes of "Planes, Trains and Automobiles". The story, based on fact, doesn't offer any real surprises as the usual obstacles and hiccups along the way emerge. What this film does have, aside from commendable humour, is a heart to it and a sense that (for once) winning isn't everything. It does look its age in places - the bobsledding scenes are understandably rough around the edges and the day-glo fashions are extremely reminiscent of the early Nineties - but "Cool Runnings" remains a very watchable effort. It doesn't have any pretences of greatness about it, unlike most other sports films where "the big game" at the end is literally the biggest thing in the world. Here, they just want to compete and this sits well with the easy-going Jamaican vibe to the film which is undeniably infectious. Despite the snow and ice, the film has a warm, sunny glow to it and while I detest describing anything as "heartwarming", "Cool Runnings" would certainly qualify. Champion!

    Based on the true story of first Jamaican Bobsled team on Winter Olympics 1988, this movie is one of funniest movies i've ever seen, yet contains lot of morals. Patriotism, friendship, teamwork, willingness, sacrifice and many more. A brilliant work from Disney. I don't get it why people just rate this movie 6 out of 10. It's deserved at least 7 pointers. I've watched this movie several times but still, the ending is very touching and makes me teary, although i've already known how this movie end. You've never seen this movie before? just go and grab the DVD's, and feel the emotions when the four crossed the finish line. It's a must-watch family movie and perfect 10 score for this movie from me :D

    This was a great movie, and knowing it was based on a true story makes it even better. I loved every minute of this brilliantly made film. One character being coerced into leaving the team for his father's team for his father's business will remind you of Dead Poets Society;the difference here is that he decides to stay and the father understands. The preparation scenes for the bobsled races are hilarious, and John Candy is well-cast as the disgraced ex-athlete who is talked into coaching the team who has never even seen snow, much less a bobsled! Leonard Maltin praised Candy's performance, saying "the part required acting, not comic schtick, and once again Candy proved to be a natural." I agree. The entire film was great. The team is nearly laughed off the slopes, but you can probably figure out what happens at the end. Great film! *** out of ****

    Disney has a handful of sports films such as The Mighty Ducks films, The Rookie (2002), Remember the Titans (2000), Angels in the Outfield (1994), Invincible (2006), Miracle (2004), etc. Cool Runnings made me laugh throughout the entire movie. The film stars John Candy, Leon, Doug E. Doug, Rawle D. Lewis, Malik Yoba, etc. Irving Blitzer (John Candy) disgraced himself when putting extra weights into his team's bob in the Olympics, resulting in his gold medal being taken away from him. Years later, Derice Bannock, son to a former friend of Irv, fails to qualify for the 100-yard sprint for the Olympics due to a stupid accident. But when he hears of Irving Blitzer living also on Jamaica, Derice decides to go to the Games anyway. If not as a sprinter, then as a bobsledder. After some starting problems, the first Jamaican bobsledding team is formed and heads for Calgary. In the freezing weather Derice, Sanka, Junior and Yul are only laughed at, since nobody can take a Jamaican bobsledding team led by a disgraced trainer for serious. But team spirit and a healthy self confidence may lead to a few surprises in the upcoming Winter Games. This is one heck of a funny movie that I've seen in years. But too bad that John Candy passed away a year later after this is made, his official last movie for him was Wagon's East, but he did Canadian Bacon before that, but it came out in 1995. This is another movie you should see, you'll laugh like crazy. Cool Runnings gets 10 stars.

    Perhaps I may be slightly biased, as I can honestly say I do love this film, however I think my feelings are justified. You don't watch Cool Runnings to find some deep, intellectual meaning, or to grow and develop as a person. If you do, well, you're an idiot. Cool Runnings is aimed purely at giving you a fun ride, and it excels at that. There are plenty of clich&eacute;s, the characters are obvious yet lovable, and the general message is the old-fashioned, much used one of overcoming opposition. However, since when are those things a crime? Cool Runnings may not break new ground in the film world, but what it does it does very well, and if you don't find yourself caught up cheering along the team then I mourn for the death of the child in you.

Aspiring sprinter Derice (Leon) dreams of competing in the Olympics but at the trials, he is unfortunately tripped up by fellow competitor Junior (Rawle D. Lewis) and blows his chance. Initially distraught, he soon discovers that a legendary bobsleigh coach (John Candy) lives on Jamaica and decides to start competing in the Winter Olympics as part of Jamaica's first bobsled team. Recruiting his best friend Sanka (Doug E. Doug) and fellow sprinter Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), the five of them jet off to Calgary to compete despite the fact that they have no sled, no real exposure to the cold and the lack of acceptance from the other competitors. But bobsledding is about more than technique - it's about belief, friendship and not taking things too seriously. Anybody expecting a serious sports drama had better look elsewhere because "Cool Runnings" never takes itself seriously. In fact, the greatest compliment I can pay it is that for the most part, it never actually feels like a sports movie - mainly due to the comedy which is both funny and well-performed. With Candy being the only actor I recognise, the four leads acquit themselves very well alongside their heavyweight co-star, who seems to be lacking some of the spark that made him so watchable in the likes of "Planes, Trains and Automobiles". The story, based on fact, doesn't offer any real surprises as the usual obstacles and hiccups along the way emerge. What this film does have, aside from commendable humour, is a heart to it and a sense that (for once) winning isn't everything. It does look its age in places - the bobsledding scenes are understandably rough around the edges and the day-glo fashions are extremely reminiscent of the early Nineties - but "Cool Runnings" remains a very watchable effort. It doesn't have any pretences of greatness about it, unlike most other sports films where "the big game" at the end is literally the biggest thing in the world. Here, they just want to compete and this sits well with the easy-going Jamaican vibe to the film which is undeniably infectious. Despite the snow and ice, the film has a warm, sunny glow to it and while I detest describing anything as "heartwarming", "Cool Runnings" would certainly qualify. Champion!

    Based on the true story of first Jamaican Bobsled team on Winter Olympics 1988, this movie is one of funniest movies i've ever seen, yet contains lot of morals. Patriotism, friendship, teamwork, willingness, sacrifice and many more. A brilliant work from Disney. I don't get it why people just rate this movie 6 out of 10. It's deserved at least 7 pointers. I've watched this movie several times but still, the ending is very touching and makes me teary, although i've already known how this movie end. You've never seen this movie before? just go and grab the DVD's, and feel the emotions when the four crossed the finish line. It's a must-watch family movie and perfect 10 score for this movie from me :D

    This was a great movie, and knowing it was based on a true story makes it even better. I loved every minute of this brilliantly made film. One character being coerced into leaving the team for his father's team for his father's business will remind you of Dead Poets Society;the difference here is that he decides to stay and the father understands. The preparation scenes for the bobsled races are hilarious, and John Candy is well-cast as the disgraced ex-athlete who is talked into coaching the team who has never even seen snow, much less a bobsled! Leonard Maltin praised Candy's performance, saying "the part required acting, not comic schtick, and once again Candy proved to be a natural." I agree. The entire film was great. The team is nearly laughed off the slopes, but you can probably figure out what happens at the end. Great film! *** out of ****

    Disney has a handful of sports films such as The Mighty Ducks films, The Rookie (2002), Remember the Titans (2000), Angels in the Outfield (1994), Invincible (2006), Miracle (2004), etc. Cool Runnings made me laugh throughout the entire movie. The film stars John Candy, Leon, Doug E. Doug, Rawle D. Lewis, Malik Yoba, etc. Irving Blitzer (John Candy) disgraced himself when putting extra weights into his team's bob in the Olympics, resulting in his gold medal being taken away from him. Years later, Derice Bannock, son to a former friend of Irv, fails to qualify for the 100-yard sprint for the Olympics due to a stupid accident. But when he hears of Irving Blitzer living also on Jamaica, Derice decides to go to the Games anyway. If not as a sprinter, then as a bobsledder. After some starting problems, the first Jamaican bobsledding team is formed and heads for Calgary. In the freezing weather Derice, Sanka, Junior and Yul are only laughed at, since nobody can take a Jamaican bobsledding team led by a disgraced trainer for serious. But team spirit and a healthy self confidence may lead to a few surprises in the upcoming Winter Games. This is one heck of a funny movie that I've seen in years. But too bad that John Candy passed away a year later after this is made, his official last movie for him was Wagon's East, but he did Canadian Bacon before that, but it came out in 1995. This is another movie you should see, you'll laugh like crazy. Cool Runnings gets 10 stars.

    Perhaps I may be slightly biased, as I can honestly say I do love this film, however I think my feelings are justified. You don't watch Cool Runnings to find some deep, intellectual meaning, or to grow and develop as a person. If you do, well, you're an idiot. Cool Runnings is aimed purely at giving you a fun ride, and it excels at that. There are plenty of clich&eacute;s, the characters are obvious yet lovable, and the general message is the old-fashioned, much used one of overcoming opposition. However, since when are those things a crime? Cool Runnings may not break new ground in the film world, but what it does it does very well, and if you don't find yourself caught up cheering along the team then I mourn for the death of the child in you.

    Top casting, top acting, top script, photography, background musical score & direction. With established comedy actor John Candy(Uncle Buck, Planes Trains and Automobiles) and a solid supporting cast which includes Leon and Doug E. Doug. This film is loosely based on the true story of the Jamaica national bobsled team's debut in the bobsleigh competition of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Canada. Plot: Irving "Irv" Blitzer was an American bobsled two time Gold Medalist at the 1968 Winter Olympics who finished first in two events again during the 1972 Winter Olympics but was disqualified from the latter for cheating and retired in disgrace to Jamaica, where he leads an impoverished life as a bookie. Irving is approached by two Jamaican athletes: top 100m runner Derice Bannock, who failed to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympics when another opponent tripped him at the trials, and Sanka Coffie, a champion push cart racer. The athletes wish to use Irving's previous experience as a Coach in order to compete in the 1988 Winter Olympics as bobsledders. Irving had been good friends with Derice's father, Ben, a former sprinter whom Irving had tried to recruit for the bobsled team years ago, who is presumed to be deceased. Yul Brenner, another runner who was tripped at the qualifier, joins the team as does as Junior Bevil, the runner who tripped Yul and Derice. Eventually Irving is convinced to coach the team. The four try to find various ways to earn money to get in the Olympics; singing on the street, arm wrestling, and holding a kissing booth, but all fail. Junior, however, sells his car, which gets the team the money that they need. In Calgary, Irving manages to acquire an old practice sled from the American team, as the Jamaicans have never been in an actual bobsled. The Jamaicans are looked down upon by other countries, in particular the East German team whose arrogant leader, Josef, tells them to go home, resulting in a bar fight. The team resolves to view the contest more seriously, continuing to train and improve their technique. They qualify for the finals, but are briefly disqualified. At the primary judge meeting, Irving immediately confronts his former coach from the '72 Olympic Winter Games Kurt Hemphill, now a primary judge of the '88 Olympic Winter Games, for disqualifying the Jamaicans for his mistake. He confesses that he made the biggest mistake in his life by cheating by hiding weights underneath the sled to make it run faster. Irving's 1972 Gold Medals were revoked and he embarrassed his country with the scandal. He says that if Hemphill wants revenge, just punish him, not his team. He begs Hemphill to let the Jamaicans qualify and represent their country in the Olympics. Later, the judges overturn their decision and the Jamaicans are back in. The Jamaicans' first day on the track results in more embarrassment and a last place finish. Sanka convinces Derice to stop copying qualities of the Swiss team. Once the team develops their own style, the second day proves better; the Jamaican team finishes with a fast time which puts them in eighth position. Later, Irving tells Derice the truth about his past and convinces him to think of himself as a champion even if he doesn't win the gold, saying, "A gold medal is nice, but if you're not enough without one, you'll never be enough with one." For the first half of the final day's race it looks as though they will break the world bobsled speed record, until tragedy strikes: their sled, due to one of the blades falling off, flips on its side coming out of a turn towards the end of their run, leaving them meters short of the finish line. However, the team lifts the sled over their shoulders and walks across the finish line to rousing applause from spectators, including Josef, Hempill, and Junior's father. The team, at the end, feels accomplished enough to return in four years to the next winter Olympics. A brief epilogue states the team returned to Jamaica as heroes and upon their return to the Winter Olympics four years later, they were treated as equals. Completely unlike the story in the film, the Jamaican team was not in conflict with any of the other international bobsledding teams. Other teams were, in fact, supportive of the Jamaican team. One of the other teams even lent the Jamaican team a backup sled so they could qualify. The bobsled competition in the film consists of three individual runs, whereas in reality the Olympic bobsled competition is two runs a day held over a two day period. In the film, the Jamaicans are on world record pace during the final run of the competition when their sled crashes. They emerge from the sled and carry it across the finish line. In real life, however, the crash occurred before the finals (eliminating the Jamaicans) and Jamaica was not on a world record pace. However, real-life footage of the crash was used in the film. After the crash, the team walked next to their sled as track officials slid it down the track. They received sporadic applause, but not a rhythmic slow clap as in the movie Verdict: A MUST BUY FILM THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL ENJOY.

    This is a surprisingly inspiring and uplifting movie. Not like the pathetic, unnecessarily crass comedies released these days. I was only 3 when this came out, first time I watched it I was 8 I believe, and in the 14 years or so since I have watched this movie maybe 10 or so times. There are laugh out loud moments as well as frustrating ones, times that your eyes might get a little moist and at least a few instances when I've wanted to jump off my seat and cheer in front of the TV - even after all these years. This movie is truly a classic and deserves more recognition for how well written it is and for the talented actors who bring the script to life. BRILLIANT.

    John Candy is Irving Blitzer, a former Olympic medalist in the bobsledding, who was disgrace and stripped of his medals for cheating. He moved to Barbados and became a bookie. He meets a Jamaican sprinter named Derice, and a pushcart racer, Sanka, and they convince him to coach them for the Calgary Winter Olympics. Two more sprinters join the team and Irving acquires an old sled to practice with. They are mocked by the East German team, resulting in a bar fight. The team trains hard, and after struggling, finally qualify for the Olympics. John Candy is excellent as the affable coach, and the athletes, convincing as the bobsledders. The feel good Rocky, triumph over adversity story has been done many times, and Cool Runnings is one of the funnier ones.

    Cool Runnings. I first saw this film as a random watch because i was pretty bored on a Weekend afternoon. And boy, was I immediately hooked. It's one of those rare films that you could watch over and over again without getting tired of it, and that is really what i liked most about Cool Runnings. I also loved this movie because of the fact it was based on a true story. These movies always leave me wanting to know what actually happened in real life, if i didn't know already, which allowed me compare how close the feature was to the actual event. Apart from the characters having different names, the other parts were pretty much accurate, and that always gives a film a boosted rating from me. The plot was well put together as well in my eyes, mainly because the characters all seem to have fitted in with the storyline anyway. You could clearly see from the start who the 4 main characters were going to be, and it remained that way throughout. The characters themselves were perfectly casted, particularly Rawle D. Lewis (Junior Bevil. His ability to play his personality is an all-time favourite. The late John Candy was very good as Irv Blitzer as well. Overall this film is an all-time great, and will be for years to come. 5 stars ***** 10/10

    In one of John Candy last films and one I somehow missed to watch when released in 1993/94 (there was great hype surrounding it) it is certainly not one to be taken seriously but I can't recall a Candy movie that does. It is very loosely based on the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the Winter Olympics in 1988 and nowhere near a biography. In fact almost everything is fictional. And that's what makes it more fun. Candy stars a disgraced former bobsleigh gold medalist (now a bookie) tasked to coach a top 100m sprinter (Leon Robinson) and his motley crew to become the Jamaican representatives at the bobsleigh races at the Winter Olympics in Canada despite having inexperience in snowy weather. Hence all daft. childish and sometimes predictable mishaps on the way but never failing to raise a smile. All characters are likable and all the stereotypes are there: the intelligent one, the hard man, the wimp and the fool. Good cheesy family fun and that it is intended to be.

    There are a select few films that seem to resonate with everybody. I cannot remember anyone who had seen this that didn't enjoy it but somehow, it had escaped my attention until now. So forgive me if I'm a little late to the party but at least I now understand where you are all coming from. Yes, it's a Disney sport-based movie and yes, it hasn't dated that well in terms of effects (or fashions!). But there is a real charm, chemistry between the leads and genuine humour to it that lifts this above most other movies of this type. It's not quite "Rocky" but given a Jamaican twist and you're halfway there. Aspiring sprinter Derice (Leon) dreams of competing in the Olympics but at the trials, he is unfortunately tripped up by fellow competitor Junior (Rawle D. Lewis) and blows his chance. Initially distraught, he soon discovers that a legendary bobsleigh coach (John Candy) lives on Jamaica and decides to start competing in the Winter Olympics as part of Jamaica's first bobsled team. Recruiting his best friend Sanka (Doug E. Doug) and fellow sprinter Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), the five of them jet off to Calgary to compete despite the fact that they have no sled, no real exposure to the cold and the lack of acceptance from the other competitors. But bobsledding is about more than technique - it's about belief, friendship and not taking things too seriously. Anybody expecting a serious sports drama had better look elsewhere because "Cool Runnings" never takes itself seriously. In fact, the greatest compliment I can pay it is that for the most part, it never actually feels like a sports movie - mainly due to the comedy which is both funny and well-performed. With Candy being the only actor I recognise, the four leads acquit themselves very well alongside their heavyweight co-star, who seems to be lacking some of the spark that made him so watchable in the likes of "Planes, Trains and Automobiles".

Here, they just want to compete and this sits well with the easy-going Jamaican vibe to the film which is undeniably infectious. Despite the snow and ice, the film has a warm, sunny glow to it and while I detest describing anything as "heartwarming", "Cool Runnings" would certainly qualify. Champion!

    John Candy is Irving Blitzer, a former Olympic medalist in the bobsledding, who was disgrace and stripped of his medals for cheating. He moved to Barbados and became a bookie. He meets a Jamaican sprinter named Derice, and a pushcart racer, Sanka, and they convince him to coach them for the Calgary Winter Olympics. Two more sprinters join the team and Irving acquires an old sled to practice with. They are mocked by the East German team, resulting in a bar fight. The team trains hard, and after struggling, finally qualify for the Olympics. John Candy is excellent as the affable coach, and the athletes, convincing as the bobsledders. The feel good Rocky, triumph over adversity story has been done many times, and Cool Runnings is one of the funnier ones.

    Cool Runnings. I first saw this film as a random watch because i was pretty bored on a Weekend afternoon. And boy, was I immediately hooked. It's one of those rare films that you could watch over and over again without getting tired of it, and that is really what i liked most about Cool Runnings. I also loved this movie because of the fact it was based on a true story. These movies always leave me wanting to know what actually happened in real life, if i didn't know already, which allowed me compare how close the feature was to the actual event. Apart from the characters having different names, the other parts were pretty much accurate, and that always gives a film a boosted rating from me. The plot was well put together as well in my eyes, mainly because the characters all seem to have fitted in with the storyline anyway. You could clearly see from the start who the 4 main characters were going to be, and it remained that way throughout. The characters themselves were perfectly casted, particularly Rawle D. Lewis (Junior Bevil. His ability to play his personality is an all-time favourite. The late John Candy was very good as Irv Blitzer as well. Overall this film is an all-time great, and will be for years to come. 5 stars ***** 10/10

    In one of John Candy last films and one I somehow missed to watch when released in 1993/94 (there was great hype surrounding it) it is certainly not one to be taken seriously but I can't recall a Candy movie that does. It is very loosely based on the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the Winter Olympics in 1988 and nowhere near a biography. In fact almost everything is fictional. And that's what makes it more fun. Candy stars a disgraced former bobsleigh gold medalist (now a bookie) tasked to coach a top 100m sprinter (Leon Robinson) and his motley crew to become the Jamaican representatives at the bobsleigh races at the Winter Olympics in Canada despite having inexperience in snowy weather. Hence all daft. childish and sometimes predictable mishaps on the way but never failing to raise a smile. All characters are likable and all the stereotypes are there: the intelligent one, the hard man, the wimp and the fool. Good cheesy family fun and that it is intended to be.

    There are a select few films that seem to resonate with everybody. I cannot remember anyone who had seen this that didn't enjoy it but somehow, it had escaped my attention until now. So forgive me if I'm a little late to the party but at least I now understand where you are all coming from. Yes, it's a Disney sport-based movie and yes, it hasn't dated that well in terms of effects (or fashions!). But there is a real charm, chemistry between the leads and genuine humour to it that lifts this above most other movies of this type. It's not quite "Rocky" but given a Jamaican twist and you're halfway there. Aspiring sprinter Derice (Leon) dreams of competing in the Olympics but at the trials, he is unfortunately tripped up by fellow competitor Junior (Rawle D. Lewis) and blows his chance. Initially distraught, he soon discovers that a legendary bobsleigh coach (John Candy) lives on Jamaica and decides to start competing in the Winter Olympics as part of Jamaica's first bobsled team. Recruiting his best friend Sanka (Doug E. Doug) and fellow sprinter Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), the five of them jet off to Calgary to compete despite the fact that they have no sled, no real exposure to the cold and the lack of acceptance from the other competitors. But bobsledding is about more than technique - it's about belief, friendship and not taking things too seriously. Anybody expecting a serious sports drama had better look elsewhere because "Cool Runnings" never takes itself seriously. In fact, the greatest compliment I can pay it is that for the most part, it never actually feels like a sports movie - mainly due to the comedy which is both funny and well-performed. With Candy being the only actor I recognise, the four leads acquit themselves very well alongside their heavyweight co-star, who seems to be lacking some of the spark that made him so watchable in the likes of "Planes, Trains and Automobiles". The story, based on fact, doesn't offer any real surprises as the usual obstacles and hiccups along the way emerge. What this film does have, aside from commendable humour, is a heart to it and a sense that (for once) winning isn't everything. It does look its age in places - the bobsledding scenes are understandably rough around the edges and the day-glo fashions are extremely reminiscent of the early Nineties - but "Cool Runnings" remains a very watchable effort. It doesn't have any pretences of greatness about it, unlike most other sports films where "the big game" at the end is literally the biggest thing in the world. Here, they just want to compete and this sits well with the easy-going Jamaican vibe to the film which is undeniably infectious. Despite the snow and ice, the film has a warm, sunny glow to it and while I detest describing anything as "heartwarming", "Cool Runnings" would certainly qualify. Champion!

    Based on the true story of first Jamaican Bobsled team on Winter Olympics 1988, this movie is one of funniest movies i've ever seen, yet contains lot of morals. Patriotism, friendship, teamwork, willingness, sacrifice and many more. A brilliant work from Disney. I don't get it why people just rate this movie 6 out of 10. It's deserved at least 7 pointers. I've watched this movie several times but still, the ending is very touching and makes me teary, although i've already known how this movie end. You've never seen this movie before? just go and grab the DVD's, and feel the emotions when the four crossed the finish line. It's a must-watch family movie and perfect 10 score for this movie from me :D

    This was a great movie, and knowing it was based on a true story makes it even better. I loved every minute of this brilliantly made film. One character being coerced into leaving the team for his father's team for his father's business will remind you of Dead Poets Society;the difference here is that he decides to stay and the father understands. The preparation scenes for the bobsled races are hilarious, and John Candy is well-cast as the disgraced ex-athlete who is talked into coaching the team who has never even seen snow, much less a bobsled! Leonard Maltin praised Candy's performance, saying "the part required acting, not comic schtick, and once again Candy proved to be a natural." I agree. The entire film was great. The team is nearly laughed off the slopes, but you can probably figure out what happens at the end. Great film! *** out of ****

    Disney has a handful of sports films such as The Mighty Ducks films, The Rookie (2002), Remember the Titans (2000), Angels in the Outfield (1994), Invincible (2006), Miracle (2004), etc. Cool Runnings made me laugh throughout the entire movie. The film stars John Candy, Leon, Doug E. Doug, Rawle D. Lewis, Malik Yoba, etc. Irving Blitzer (John Candy) disgraced himself when putting extra weights into his team's bob in the Olympics, resulting in his gold medal being taken away from him. Years later, Derice Bannock, son to a former friend of Irv, fails to qualify for the 100-yard sprint for the Olympics due to a stupid accident. But when he hears of Irving Blitzer living also on Jamaica, Derice decides to go to the Games anyway. If not as a sprinter, then as a bobsledder. After some starting problems, the first Jamaican bobsledding team is formed and heads for Calgary. In the freezing weather Derice, Sanka, Junior and Yul are only laughed at, since nobody can take a Jamaican bobsledding team led by a disgraced trainer for serious. But team spirit and a healthy self confidence may lead to a few surprises in the upcoming Winter Games. This is one heck of a funny movie that I've seen in years. But too bad that John Candy passed away a year later after this is made, his official last movie for him was Wagon's East, but he did Canadian Bacon before that, but it came out in 1995. This is another movie you should see, you'll laugh like crazy. Cool Runnings gets 10 stars.

    Perhaps I may be slightly biased, as I can honestly say I do love this film, however I think my feelings are justified. You don't watch Cool Runnings to find some deep, intellectual meaning, or to grow and develop as a person. If you do, well, you're an idiot. Cool Runnings is aimed purely at giving you a fun ride, and it excels at that. There are plenty of clich&eacute;s, the characters are obvious yet lovable, and the general message is the old-fashioned, much used one of overcoming opposition. However, since when are those things a crime? Cool Runnings may not break new ground in the film world, but what it does it does very well, and if you don't find yourself caught up cheering along the team then I mourn for the death of the child in you.

    Top casting, top acting, top script, photography, background musical score & direction. With established comedy actor John Candy(Uncle Buck, Planes Trains and Automobiles) and a solid supporting cast which includes Leon and Doug E. Doug. This film is loosely based on the true story of the Jamaica national bobsled team's debut in the bobsleigh competition of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Canada. Plot: Irving "Irv" Blitzer was an American bobsled two time Gold Medalist at the 1968 Winter Olympics who finished first in two events again during the 1972 Winter Olympics but was disqualified from the latter for cheating and retired in disgrace to Jamaica, where he leads an impoverished life as a bookie. Irving is approached by two Jamaican athletes: top 100m runner Derice Bannock, who failed to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympics when another opponent tripped him at the trials, and Sanka Coffie, a champion push cart racer. The athletes wish to use Irving's previous experience as a Coach in order to compete in the 1988 Winter Olympics as bobsledders. Irving had been good friends with Derice's father, Ben, a former sprinter whom Irving had tried to recruit for the bobsled team years ago, who is presumed to be deceased. Yul Brenner, another runner who was tripped at the qualifier, joins the team as does as Junior Bevil, the runner who tripped Yul and Derice. Eventually Irving is convinced to coach the team. The four try to find various ways to earn money to get in the Olympics; singing on the street, arm wrestling, and holding a kissing booth, but all fail. Junior, however, sells his car, which gets the team the money that they need. In Calgary, Irving manages to acquire an old practice sled from the American team, as the Jamaicans have never been in an actual bobsled. The Jamaicans are looked down upon by other countries, in particular the East German team whose arrogant leader, Josef, tells them to go home, resulting in a bar fight. The team resolves to view the contest more seriously, continuing to train and improve their technique. They qualify for the finals, but are briefly disqualified. At the primary judge meeting, Irving immediately confronts his former coach from the '72 Olympic Winter Games Kurt Hemphill, now a primary judge of the '88 Olympic Winter Games, for disqualifying the Jamaicans for his mistake. He confesses that he made the biggest mistake in his life by cheating by hiding weights underneath the sled to make it run faster. Irving's 1972 Gold Medals were revoked and he embarrassed his country with the scandal. He says that if Hemphill wants revenge, just punish him, not his team. He begs Hemphill to let the Jamaicans qualify and represent their country in the Olympics. Later, the judges overturn their decision and the Jamaicans are back in. The Jamaicans' first day on the track results in more embarrassment and a last place finish. Sanka convinces Derice to stop copying qualities of the Swiss team. Once the team develops their own style, the second day proves better; the Jamaican team finishes with a fast time which puts them in eighth position. Later, Irving tells Derice the truth about his past and convinces him to think of himself as a champion even if he doesn't win the gold, saying, "A gold medal is nice, but if you're not enough without one, you'll never be enough with one." For the first half of the final day's race it looks as though they will break the world bobsled speed record, until tragedy strikes: their sled, due to one of the blades falling off, flips on its side coming out of a turn towards the end of their run, leaving them meters short of the finish line. However, the team lifts the sled over their shoulders and walks across the finish line to rousing applause from spectators, including Josef, Hempill, and Junior's father. The team, at the end, feels accomplished enough to return in four years to the next winter Olympics. A brief epilogue states the team returned to Jamaica as heroes and upon their return to the Winter Olympics four years later, they were treated as equals. Completely unlike the story in the film, the Jamaican team was not in conflict with any of the other international bobsledding teams. Other teams were, in fact, supportive of the Jamaican team. One of the other teams even lent the Jamaican team a backup sled so they could qualify. The bobsled competition in the film consists of three individual runs, whereas in reality the Olympic bobsled competition is two runs a day held over a two day period. In the film, the Jamaicans are on world record pace during the final run of the competition when their sled crashes. They emerge from the sled and carry it across the finish line. In real life, however, the crash occurred before the finals (eliminating the Jamaicans) and Jamaica was not on a world record pace. However, real-life footage of the crash was used in the film. After the crash, the team walked next to their sled as track officials slid it down the track. They received sporadic applause, but not a rhythmic slow clap as in the movie Verdict: A MUST BUY FILM THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL ENJOY.

    This is a surprisingly inspiring and uplifting movie. Not like the pathetic, unnecessarily crass comedies released these days. I was only 3 when this came out, first time I watched it I was 8 I believe, and in the 14 years or so since I have watched this movie maybe 10 or so times. There are laugh out loud moments as well as frustrating ones, times that your eyes might get a little moist and at least a few instances when I've wanted to jump off my seat and cheer in front of the TV - even after all these years. This movie is truly a classic and deserves more recognition for how well written it is and for the talented actors who bring the script to life. BRILLIANT.

The athletes wish to use Irving's previous experience as a Coach in order to compete in the 1988 Winter Olympics as bobsledders. Irving had been good friends with Derice's father, Ben, a former sprinter whom Irving had tried to recruit for the bobsled team years ago, who is presumed to be deceased. Yul Brenner, another runner who was tripped at the qualifier, joins the team as does as Junior Bevil, the runner who tripped Yul and Derice. Eventually Irving is convinced to coach the team. The four try to find various ways to earn money to get in the Olympics; singing on the street, arm wrestling, and holding a kissing booth, but all fail. Junior, however, sells his car, which gets the team the money that they need. In Calgary, Irving manages to acquire an old practice sled from the American team, as the Jamaicans have never been in an actual bobsled. The Jamaicans are looked down upon by other countries, in particular the East German team whose arrogant leader, Josef, tells them to go home, resulting in a bar fight. The team resolves to view the contest more seriously, continuing to train and improve their technique. They qualify for the finals, but are briefly disqualified. At the primary judge meeting, Irving immediately confronts his former coach from the '72 Olympic Winter Games Kurt Hemphill, now a primary judge of the '88 Olympic Winter Games, for disqualifying the Jamaicans for his mistake. He confesses that he made the biggest mistake in his life by cheating by hiding weights underneath the sled to make it run faster. Irving's 1972 Gold Medals were revoked and he embarrassed his country with the scandal. He says that if Hemphill wants revenge, just punish him, not his team. He begs Hemphill to let the Jamaicans qualify and represent their country in the Olympics. Later, the judges overturn their decision and the Jamaicans are back in. The Jamaicans' first day on the track results in more embarrassment and a last place finish. Sanka convinces Derice to stop copying qualities of the Swiss team. Once the team develops their own style, the second day proves better; the Jamaican team finishes with a fast time which puts them in eighth position. Later, Irving tells Derice the truth about his past and convinces him to think of himself as a champion even if he doesn't win the gold, saying, "A gold medal is nice, but if you're not enough without one, you'll never be enough with one." For the first half of the final day's race it looks as though they will break the world bobsled speed record, until tragedy strikes: their sled, due to one of the blades falling off, flips on its side coming out of a turn towards the end of their run, leaving them meters short of the finish line. However, the team lifts the sled over their shoulders and walks across the finish line to rousing applause from spectators, including Josef, Hempill, and Junior's father. The team, at the end, feels accomplished enough to return in four years to the next winter Olympics. A brief epilogue states the team returned to Jamaica as heroes and upon their return to the Winter Olympics four years later, they were treated as equals. Completely unlike the story in the film, the Jamaican team was not in conflict with any of the other international bobsledding teams. Other teams were, in fact, supportive of the Jamaican team. One of the other teams even lent the Jamaican team a backup sled so they could qualify. The bobsled competition in the film consists of three individual runs, whereas in reality the Olympic bobsled competition is two runs a day held over a two day period. In the film, the Jamaicans are on world record pace during the final run of the competition when their sled crashes. They emerge from the sled and carry it across the finish line. In real life, however, the crash occurred before the finals (eliminating the Jamaicans) and Jamaica was not on a world record pace. However, real-life footage of the crash was used in the film. After the crash, the team walked next to their sled as track officials slid it down the track. They received sporadic applause, but not a rhythmic slow clap as in the movie Verdict: A MUST BUY FILM THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL ENJOY.

    This is a surprisingly inspiring and uplifting movie. Not like the pathetic, unnecessarily crass comedies released these days. I was only 3 when this came out, first time I watched it I was 8 I believe, and in the 14 years or so since I have watched this movie maybe 10 or so times. There are laugh out loud moments as well as frustrating ones, times that your eyes might get a little moist and at least a few instances when I've wanted to jump off my seat and cheer in front of the TV - even after all these years. This movie is truly a classic and deserves more recognition for how well written it is and for the talented actors who bring the script to life. BRILLIANT.

    John Candy is Irving Blitzer, a former Olympic medalist in the bobsledding, who was disgrace and stripped of his medals for cheating. He moved to Barbados and became a bookie. He meets a Jamaican sprinter named Derice, and a pushcart racer, Sanka, and they convince him to coach them for the Calgary Winter Olympics. Two more sprinters join the team and Irving acquires an old sled to practice with. They are mocked by the East German team, resulting in a bar fight. The team trains hard, and after struggling, finally qualify for the Olympics. John Candy is excellent as the affable coach, and the athletes, convincing as the bobsledders. The feel good Rocky, triumph over adversity story has been done many times, and Cool Runnings is one of the funnier ones.

    Cool Runnings. I first saw this film as a random watch because i was pretty bored on a Weekend afternoon. And boy, was I immediately hooked. It's one of those rare films that you could watch over and over again without getting tired of it, and that is really what i liked most about Cool Runnings. I also loved this movie because of the fact it was based on a true story. These movies always leave me wanting to know what actually happened in real life, if i didn't know already, which allowed me compare how close the feature was to the actual event. Apart from the characters having different names, the other parts were pretty much accurate, and that always gives a film a boosted rating from me. The plot was well put together as well in my eyes, mainly because the characters all seem to have fitted in with the storyline anyway. You could clearly see from the start who the 4 main characters were going to be, and it remained that way throughout. The characters themselves were perfectly casted, particularly Rawle D. Lewis (Junior Bevil. His ability to play his personality is an all-time favourite. The late John Candy was very good as Irv Blitzer as well. Overall this film is an all-time great, and will be for years to come. 5 stars ***** 10/10

    In one of John Candy last films and one I somehow missed to watch when released in 1993/94 (there was great hype surrounding it) it is certainly not one to be taken seriously but I can't recall a Candy movie that does. It is very loosely based on the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the Winter Olympics in 1988 and nowhere near a biography. In fact almost everything is fictional. And that's what makes it more fun. Candy stars a disgraced former bobsleigh gold medalist (now a bookie) tasked to coach a top 100m sprinter (Leon Robinson) and his motley crew to become the Jamaican representatives at the bobsleigh races at the Winter Olympics in Canada despite having inexperience in snowy weather. Hence all daft. childish and sometimes predictable mishaps on the way but never failing to raise a smile. All characters are likable and all the stereotypes are there: the intelligent one, the hard man, the wimp and the fool. Good cheesy family fun and that it is intended to be.

    There are a select few films that seem to resonate with everybody. I cannot remember anyone who had seen this that didn't enjoy it but somehow, it had escaped my attention until now. So forgive me if I'm a little late to the party but at least I now understand where you are all coming from. Yes, it's a Disney sport-based movie and yes, it hasn't dated that well in terms of effects (or fashions!). But there is a real charm, chemistry between the leads and genuine humour to it that lifts this above most other movies of this type. It's not quite "Rocky" but given a Jamaican twist and you're halfway there. Aspiring sprinter Derice (Leon) dreams of competing in the Olympics but at the trials, he is unfortunately tripped up by fellow competitor Junior (Rawle D. Lewis) and blows his chance. Initially distraught, he soon discovers that a legendary bobsleigh coach (John Candy) lives on Jamaica and decides to start competing in the Winter Olympics as part of Jamaica's first bobsled team. Recruiting his best friend Sanka (Doug E. Doug) and fellow sprinter Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), the five of them jet off to Calgary to compete despite the fact that they have no sled, no real exposure to the cold and the lack of acceptance from the other competitors. But bobsledding is about more than technique - it's about belief, friendship and not taking things too seriously. Anybody expecting a serious sports drama had better look elsewhere because "Cool Runnings" never takes itself seriously. In fact, the greatest compliment I can pay it is that for the most part, it never actually feels like a sports movie - mainly due to the comedy which is both funny and well-performed. With Candy being the only actor I recognise, the four leads acquit themselves very well alongside their heavyweight co-star, who seems to be lacking some of the spark that made him so watchable in the likes of "Planes, Trains and Automobiles". The story, based on fact, doesn't offer any real surprises as the usual obstacles and hiccups along the way emerge. What this film does have, aside from commendable humour, is a heart to it and a sense that (for once) winning isn't everything. It does look its age in places - the bobsledding scenes are understandably rough around the edges and the day-glo fashions are extremely reminiscent of the early Nineties - but "Cool Runnings" remains a very watchable effort. It doesn't have any pretences of greatness about it, unlike most other sports films where "the big game" at the end is literally the biggest thing in the world. Here, they just want to compete and this sits well with the easy-going Jamaican vibe to the film which is undeniably infectious. Despite the snow and ice, the film has a warm, sunny glow to it and while I detest describing anything as "heartwarming", "Cool Runnings" would certainly qualify. Champion!

    Based on the true story of first Jamaican Bobsled team on Winter Olympics 1988, this movie is one of funniest movies i've ever seen, yet contains lot of morals. Patriotism, friendship, teamwork, willingness, sacrifice and many more. A brilliant work from Disney. I don't get it why people just rate this movie 6 out of 10. It's deserved at least 7 pointers. I've watched this movie several times but still, the ending is very touching and makes me teary, although i've already known how this movie end. You've never seen this movie before? just go and grab the DVD's, and feel the emotions when the four crossed the finish line. It's a must-watch family movie and perfect 10 score for this movie from me :D

    This was a great movie, and knowing it was based on a true story makes it even better. I loved every minute of this brilliantly made film. One character being coerced into leaving the team for his father's team for his father's business will remind you of Dead Poets Society;the difference here is that he decides to stay and the father understands. The preparation scenes for the bobsled races are hilarious, and John Candy is well-cast as the disgraced ex-athlete who is talked into coaching the team who has never even seen snow, much less a bobsled! Leonard Maltin praised Candy's performance, saying "the part required acting, not comic schtick, and once again Candy proved to be a natural." I agree. The entire film was great. The team is nearly laughed off the slopes, but you can probably figure out what happens at the end. Great film! *** out of ****

    Disney has a handful of sports films such as The Mighty Ducks films, The Rookie (2002), Remember the Titans (2000), Angels in the Outfield (1994), Invincible (2006), Miracle (2004), etc. Cool Runnings made me laugh throughout the entire movie. The film stars John Candy, Leon, Doug E. Doug, Rawle D. Lewis, Malik Yoba, etc. Irving Blitzer (John Candy) disgraced himself when putting extra weights into his team's bob in the Olympics, resulting in his gold medal being taken away from him. Years later, Derice Bannock, son to a former friend of Irv, fails to qualify for the 100-yard sprint for the Olympics due to a stupid accident. But when he hears of Irving Blitzer living also on Jamaica, Derice decides to go to the Games anyway. If not as a sprinter, then as a bobsledder. After some starting problems, the first Jamaican bobsledding team is formed and heads for Calgary. In the freezing weather Derice, Sanka, Junior and Yul are only laughed at, since nobody can take a Jamaican bobsledding team led by a disgraced trainer for serious. But team spirit and a healthy self confidence may lead to a few surprises in the upcoming Winter Games. This is one heck of a funny movie that I've seen in years. But too bad that John Candy passed away a year later after this is made, his official last movie for him was Wagon's East, but he did Canadian Bacon before that, but it came out in 1995. This is another movie you should see, you'll laugh like crazy. Cool Runnings gets 10 stars.

    Perhaps I may be slightly biased, as I can honestly say I do love this film, however I think my feelings are justified. You don't watch Cool Runnings to find some deep, intellectual meaning, or to grow and develop as a person. If you do, well, you're an idiot. Cool Runnings is aimed purely at giving you a fun ride, and it excels at that. There are plenty of clich&eacute;s, the characters are obvious yet lovable, and the general message is the old-fashioned, much used one of overcoming opposition. However, since when are those things a crime? Cool Runnings may not break new ground in the film world, but what it does it does very well, and if you don't find yourself caught up cheering along the team then I mourn for the death of the child in you.

    Top casting, top acting, top script, photography, background musical score & direction. With established comedy actor John Candy(Uncle Buck, Planes Trains and Automobiles) and a solid supporting cast which includes Leon and Doug E. Doug. This film is loosely based on the true story of the Jamaica national bobsled team's debut in the bobsleigh competition of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Canada. Plot: Irving "Irv" Blitzer was an American bobsled two time Gold Medalist at the 1968 Winter Olympics who finished first in two events again during the 1972 Winter Olympics but was disqualified from the latter for cheating and retired in disgrace to Jamaica, where he leads an impoverished life as a bookie. Irving is approached by two Jamaican athletes: top 100m runner Derice Bannock, who failed to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympics when another opponent tripped him at the trials, and Sanka Coffie, a champion push cart racer. The athletes wish to use Irving's previous experience as a Coach in order to compete in the 1988 Winter Olympics as bobsledders. Irving had been good friends with Derice's father, Ben, a former sprinter whom Irving had tried to recruit for the bobsled team years ago, who is presumed to be deceased. Yul Brenner, another runner who was tripped at the qualifier, joins the team as does as Junior Bevil, the runner who tripped Yul and Derice. Eventually Irving is convinced to coach the team.

    This was a great movie, and knowing it was based on a true story makes it even better. I loved every minute of this brilliantly made film. One character being coerced into leaving the team for his father's team for his father's business will remind you of Dead Poets Society;the difference here is that he decides to stay and the father understands. The preparation scenes for the bobsled races are hilarious, and John Candy is well-cast as the disgraced ex-athlete who is talked into coaching the team who has never even seen snow, much less a bobsled! Leonard Maltin praised Candy's performance, saying "the part required acting, not comic schtick, and once again Candy proved to be a natural." I agree. The entire film was great. The team is nearly laughed off the slopes, but you can probably figure out what happens at the end. Great film! *** out of ****

    Disney has a handful of sports films such as The Mighty Ducks films, The Rookie (2002), Remember the Titans (2000), Angels in the Outfield (1994), Invincible (2006), Miracle (2004), etc. Cool Runnings made me laugh throughout the entire movie. The film stars John Candy, Leon, Doug E. Doug, Rawle D. Lewis, Malik Yoba, etc. Irving Blitzer (John Candy) disgraced himself when putting extra weights into his team's bob in the Olympics, resulting in his gold medal being taken away from him. Years later, Derice Bannock, son to a former friend of Irv, fails to qualify for the 100-yard sprint for the Olympics due to a stupid accident. But when he hears of Irving Blitzer living also on Jamaica, Derice decides to go to the Games anyway. If not as a sprinter, then as a bobsledder. After some starting problems, the first Jamaican bobsledding team is formed and heads for Calgary. In the freezing weather Derice, Sanka, Junior and Yul are only laughed at, since nobody can take a Jamaican bobsledding team led by a disgraced trainer for serious. But team spirit and a healthy self confidence may lead to a few surprises in the upcoming Winter Games. This is one heck of a funny movie that I've seen in years. But too bad that John Candy passed away a year later after this is made, his official last movie for him was Wagon's East, but he did Canadian Bacon before that, but it came out in 1995. This is another movie you should see, you'll laugh like crazy. Cool Runnings gets 10 stars.

    Perhaps I may be slightly biased, as I can honestly say I do love this film, however I think my feelings are justified. You don't watch Cool Runnings to find some deep, intellectual meaning, or to grow and develop as a person. If you do, well, you're an idiot. Cool Runnings is aimed purely at giving you a fun ride, and it excels at that. There are plenty of clich&eacute;s, the characters are obvious yet lovable, and the general message is the old-fashioned, much used one of overcoming opposition. However, since when are those things a crime? Cool Runnings may not break new ground in the film world, but what it does it does very well, and if you don't find yourself caught up cheering along the team then I mourn for the death of the child in you.

    Top casting, top acting, top script, photography, background musical score & direction. With established comedy actor John Candy(Uncle Buck, Planes Trains and Automobiles) and a solid supporting cast which includes Leon and Doug E. Doug. This film is loosely based on the true story of the Jamaica national bobsled team's debut in the bobsleigh competition of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Canada. Plot: Irving "Irv" Blitzer was an American bobsled two time Gold Medalist at the 1968 Winter Olympics who finished first in two events again during the 1972 Winter Olympics but was disqualified from the latter for cheating and retired in disgrace to Jamaica, where he leads an impoverished life as a bookie. Irving is approached by two Jamaican athletes: top 100m runner Derice Bannock, who failed to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympics when another opponent tripped him at the trials, and Sanka Coffie, a champion push cart racer. The athletes wish to use Irving's previous experience as a Coach in order to compete in the 1988 Winter Olympics as bobsledders. Irving had been good friends with Derice's father, Ben, a former sprinter whom Irving had tried to recruit for the bobsled team years ago, who is presumed to be deceased. Yul Brenner, another runner who was tripped at the qualifier, joins the team as does as Junior Bevil, the runner who tripped Yul and Derice. Eventually Irving is convinced to coach the team. The four try to find various ways to earn money to get in the Olympics; singing on the street, arm wrestling, and holding a kissing booth, but all fail. Junior, however, sells his car, which gets the team the money that they need. In Calgary, Irving manages to acquire an old practice sled from the American team, as the Jamaicans have never been in an actual bobsled. The Jamaicans are looked down upon by other countries, in particular the East German team whose arrogant leader, Josef, tells them to go home, resulting in a bar fight. The team resolves to view the contest more seriously, continuing to train and improve their technique. They qualify for the finals, but are briefly disqualified. At the primary judge meeting, Irving immediately confronts his former coach from the '72 Olympic Winter Games Kurt Hemphill, now a primary judge of the '88 Olympic Winter Games, for disqualifying the Jamaicans for his mistake. He confesses that he made the biggest mistake in his life by cheating by hiding weights underneath the sled to make it run faster. Irving's 1972 Gold Medals were revoked and he embarrassed his country with the scandal. He says that if Hemphill wants revenge, just punish him, not his team. He begs Hemphill to let the Jamaicans qualify and represent their country in the Olympics. Later, the judges overturn their decision and the Jamaicans are back in. The Jamaicans' first day on the track results in more embarrassment and a last place finish. Sanka convinces Derice to stop copying qualities of the Swiss team. Once the team develops their own style, the second day proves better; the Jamaican team finishes with a fast time which puts them in eighth position. Later, Irving tells Derice the truth about his past and convinces him to think of himself as a champion even if he doesn't win the gold, saying, "A gold medal is nice, but if you're not enough without one, you'll never be enough with one." For the first half of the final day's race it looks as though they will break the world bobsled speed record, until tragedy strikes: their sled, due to one of the blades falling off, flips on its side coming out of a turn towards the end of their run, leaving them meters short of the finish line. However, the team lifts the sled over their shoulders and walks across the finish line to rousing applause from spectators, including Josef, Hempill, and Junior's father. The team, at the end, feels accomplished enough to return in four years to the next winter Olympics. A brief epilogue states the team returned to Jamaica as heroes and upon their return to the Winter Olympics four years later, they were treated as equals. Completely unlike the story in the film, the Jamaican team was not in conflict with any of the other international bobsledding teams. Other teams were, in fact, supportive of the Jamaican team. One of the other teams even lent the Jamaican team a backup sled so they could qualify. The bobsled competition in the film consists of three individual runs, whereas in reality the Olympic bobsled competition is two runs a day held over a two day period. In the film, the Jamaicans are on world record pace during the final run of the competition when their sled crashes. They emerge from the sled and carry it across the finish line. In real life, however, the crash occurred before the finals (eliminating the Jamaicans) and Jamaica was not on a world record pace. However, real-life footage of the crash was used in the film. After the crash, the team walked next to their sled as track officials slid it down the track. They received sporadic applause, but not a rhythmic slow clap as in the movie Verdict: A MUST BUY FILM THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL ENJOY.

    This is a surprisingly inspiring and uplifting movie. Not like the pathetic, unnecessarily crass comedies released these days. I was only 3 when this came out, first time I watched it I was 8 I believe, and in the 14 years or so since I have watched this movie maybe 10 or so times. There are laugh out loud moments as well as frustrating ones, times that your eyes might get a little moist and at least a few instances when I've wanted to jump off my seat and cheer in front of the TV - even after all these years. This movie is truly a classic and deserves more recognition for how well written it is and for the talented actors who bring the script to life. BRILLIANT.

    John Candy is Irving Blitzer, a former Olympic medalist in the bobsledding, who was disgrace and stripped of his medals for cheating. He moved to Barbados and became a bookie. He meets a Jamaican sprinter named Derice, and a pushcart racer, Sanka, and they convince him to coach them for the Calgary Winter Olympics. Two more sprinters join the team and Irving acquires an old sled to practice with. They are mocked by the East German team, resulting in a bar fight. The team trains hard, and after struggling, finally qualify for the Olympics. John Candy is excellent as the affable coach, and the athletes, convincing as the bobsledders. The feel good Rocky, triumph over adversity story has been done many times, and Cool Runnings is one of the funnier ones.

    Cool Runnings. I first saw this film as a random watch because i was pretty bored on a Weekend afternoon. And boy, was I immediately hooked. It's one of those rare films that you could watch over and over again without getting tired of it, and that is really what i liked most about Cool Runnings. I also loved this movie because of the fact it was based on a true story. These movies always leave me wanting to know what actually happened in real life, if i didn't know already, which allowed me compare how close the feature was to the actual event. Apart from the characters having different names, the other parts were pretty much accurate, and that always gives a film a boosted rating from me. The plot was well put together as well in my eyes, mainly because the characters all seem to have fitted in with the storyline anyway. You could clearly see from the start who the 4 main characters were going to be, and it remained that way throughout. The characters themselves were perfectly casted, particularly Rawle D. Lewis (Junior Bevil. His ability to play his personality is an all-time favourite. The late John Candy was very good as Irv Blitzer as well. Overall this film is an all-time great, and will be for years to come. 5 stars ***** 10/10

    In one of John Candy last films and one I somehow missed to watch when released in 1993/94 (there was great hype surrounding it) it is certainly not one to be taken seriously but I can't recall a Candy movie that does. It is very loosely based on the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the Winter Olympics in 1988 and nowhere near a biography. In fact almost everything is fictional. And that's what makes it more fun. Candy stars a disgraced former bobsleigh gold medalist (now a bookie) tasked to coach a top 100m sprinter (Leon Robinson) and his motley crew to become the Jamaican representatives at the bobsleigh races at the Winter Olympics in Canada despite having inexperience in snowy weather. Hence all daft. childish and sometimes predictable mishaps on the way but never failing to raise a smile. All characters are likable and all the stereotypes are there: the intelligent one, the hard man, the wimp and the fool. Good cheesy family fun and that it is intended to be.

    There are a select few films that seem to resonate with everybody. I cannot remember anyone who had seen this that didn't enjoy it but somehow, it had escaped my attention until now. So forgive me if I'm a little late to the party but at least I now understand where you are all coming from. Yes, it's a Disney sport-based movie and yes, it hasn't dated that well in terms of effects (or fashions!). But there is a real charm, chemistry between the leads and genuine humour to it that lifts this above most other movies of this type. It's not quite "Rocky" but given a Jamaican twist and you're halfway there. Aspiring sprinter Derice (Leon) dreams of competing in the Olympics but at the trials, he is unfortunately tripped up by fellow competitor Junior (Rawle D. Lewis) and blows his chance. Initially distraught, he soon discovers that a legendary bobsleigh coach (John Candy) lives on Jamaica and decides to start competing in the Winter Olympics as part of Jamaica's first bobsled team. Recruiting his best friend Sanka (Doug E. Doug) and fellow sprinter Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), the five of them jet off to Calgary to compete despite the fact that they have no sled, no real exposure to the cold and the lack of acceptance from the other competitors. But bobsledding is about more than technique - it's about belief, friendship and not taking things too seriously. Anybody expecting a serious sports drama had better look elsewhere because "Cool Runnings" never takes itself seriously. In fact, the greatest compliment I can pay it is that for the most part, it never actually feels like a sports movie - mainly due to the comedy which is both funny and well-performed. With Candy being the only actor I recognise, the four leads acquit themselves very well alongside their heavyweight co-star, who seems to be lacking some of the spark that made him so watchable in the likes of "Planes, Trains and Automobiles". The story, based on fact, doesn't offer any real surprises as the usual obstacles and hiccups along the way emerge. What this film does have, aside from commendable humour, is a heart to it and a sense that (for once) winning isn't everything. It does look its age in places - the bobsledding scenes are understandably rough around the edges and the day-glo fashions are extremely reminiscent of the early Nineties - but "Cool Runnings" remains a very watchable effort. It doesn't have any pretences of greatness about it, unlike most other sports films where "the big game" at the end is literally the biggest thing in the world. Here, they just want to compete and this sits well with the easy-going Jamaican vibe to the film which is undeniably infectious. Despite the snow and ice, the film has a warm, sunny glow to it and while I detest describing anything as "heartwarming", "Cool Runnings" would certainly qualify. Champion!

    Based on the true story of first Jamaican Bobsled team on Winter Olympics 1988, this movie is one of funniest movies i've ever seen, yet contains lot of morals. Patriotism, friendship, teamwork, willingness, sacrifice and many more. A brilliant work from Disney. I don't get it why people just rate this movie 6 out of 10. It's deserved at least 7 pointers. I've watched this movie several times but still, the ending is very touching and makes me teary, although i've already known how this movie end. You've never seen this movie before? just go and grab the DVD's, and feel the emotions when the four crossed the finish line. It's a must-watch family movie and perfect 10 score for this movie from me :D

Candy stars a disgraced former bobsleigh gold medalist (now a bookie) tasked to coach a top 100m sprinter (Leon Robinson) and his motley crew to become the Jamaican representatives at the bobsleigh races at the Winter Olympics in Canada despite having inexperience in snowy weather. Hence all daft. childish and sometimes predictable mishaps on the way but never failing to raise a smile. All characters are likable and all the stereotypes are there: the intelligent one, the hard man, the wimp and the fool. Good cheesy family fun and that it is intended to be.

    There are a select few films that seem to resonate with everybody. I cannot remember anyone who had seen this that didn't enjoy it but somehow, it had escaped my attention until now. So forgive me if I'm a little late to the party but at least I now understand where you are all coming from. Yes, it's a Disney sport-based movie and yes, it hasn't dated that well in terms of effects (or fashions!). But there is a real charm, chemistry between the leads and genuine humour to it that lifts this above most other movies of this type. It's not quite "Rocky" but given a Jamaican twist and you're halfway there. Aspiring sprinter Derice (Leon) dreams of competing in the Olympics but at the trials, he is unfortunately tripped up by fellow competitor Junior (Rawle D. Lewis) and blows his chance. Initially distraught, he soon discovers that a legendary bobsleigh coach (John Candy) lives on Jamaica and decides to start competing in the Winter Olympics as part of Jamaica's first bobsled team. Recruiting his best friend Sanka (Doug E. Doug) and fellow sprinter Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), the five of them jet off to Calgary to compete despite the fact that they have no sled, no real exposure to the cold and the lack of acceptance from the other competitors. But bobsledding is about more than technique - it's about belief, friendship and not taking things too seriously. Anybody expecting a serious sports drama had better look elsewhere because "Cool Runnings" never takes itself seriously. In fact, the greatest compliment I can pay it is that for the most part, it never actually feels like a sports movie - mainly due to the comedy which is both funny and well-performed. With Candy being the only actor I recognise, the four leads acquit themselves very well alongside their heavyweight co-star, who seems to be lacking some of the spark that made him so watchable in the likes of "Planes, Trains and Automobiles". The story, based on fact, doesn't offer any real surprises as the usual obstacles and hiccups along the way emerge. What this film does have, aside from commendable humour, is a heart to it and a sense that (for once) winning isn't everything. It does look its age in places - the bobsledding scenes are understandably rough around the edges and the day-glo fashions are extremely reminiscent of the early Nineties - but "Cool Runnings" remains a very watchable effort. It doesn't have any pretences of greatness about it, unlike most other sports films where "the big game" at the end is literally the biggest thing in the world. Here, they just want to compete and this sits well with the easy-going Jamaican vibe to the film which is undeniably infectious. Despite the snow and ice, the film has a warm, sunny glow to it and while I detest describing anything as "heartwarming", "Cool Runnings" would certainly qualify. Champion!

    Based on the true story of first Jamaican Bobsled team on Winter Olympics 1988, this movie is one of funniest movies i've ever seen, yet contains lot of morals. Patriotism, friendship, teamwork, willingness, sacrifice and many more. A brilliant work from Disney. I don't get it why people just rate this movie 6 out of 10. It's deserved at least 7 pointers. I've watched this movie several times but still, the ending is very touching and makes me teary, although i've already known how this movie end. You've never seen this movie before? just go and grab the DVD's, and feel the emotions when the four crossed the finish line. It's a must-watch family movie and perfect 10 score for this movie from me :D

    This was a great movie, and knowing it was based on a true story makes it even better. I loved every minute of this brilliantly made film. One character being coerced into leaving the team for his father's team for his father's business will remind you of Dead Poets Society;the difference here is that he decides to stay and the father understands. The preparation scenes for the bobsled races are hilarious, and John Candy is well-cast as the disgraced ex-athlete who is talked into coaching the team who has never even seen snow, much less a bobsled! Leonard Maltin praised Candy's performance, saying "the part required acting, not comic schtick, and once again Candy proved to be a natural." I agree. The entire film was great. The team is nearly laughed off the slopes, but you can probably figure out what happens at the end. Great film! *** out of ****

    Disney has a handful of sports films such as The Mighty Ducks films, The Rookie (2002), Remember the Titans (2000), Angels in the Outfield (1994), Invincible (2006), Miracle (2004), etc. Cool Runnings made me laugh throughout the entire movie. The film stars John Candy, Leon, Doug E. Doug, Rawle D. Lewis, Malik Yoba, etc. Irving Blitzer (John Candy) disgraced himself when putting extra weights into his team's bob in the Olympics, resulting in his gold medal being taken away from him. Years later, Derice Bannock, son to a former friend of Irv, fails to qualify for the 100-yard sprint for the Olympics due to a stupid accident. But when he hears of Irving Blitzer living also on Jamaica, Derice decides to go to the Games anyway. If not as a sprinter, then as a bobsledder. After some starting problems, the first Jamaican bobsledding team is formed and heads for Calgary. In the freezing weather Derice, Sanka, Junior and Yul are only laughed at, since nobody can take a Jamaican bobsledding team led by a disgraced trainer for serious. But team spirit and a healthy self confidence may lead to a few surprises in the upcoming Winter Games. This is one heck of a funny movie that I've seen in years. But too bad that John Candy passed away a year later after this is made, his official last movie for him was Wagon's East, but he did Canadian Bacon before that, but it came out in 1995. This is another movie you should see, you'll laugh like crazy. Cool Runnings gets 10 stars.

    Perhaps I may be slightly biased, as I can honestly say I do love this film, however I think my feelings are justified. You don't watch Cool Runnings to find some deep, intellectual meaning, or to grow and develop as a person. If you do, well, you're an idiot. Cool Runnings is aimed purely at giving you a fun ride, and it excels at that. There are plenty of clich&eacute;s, the characters are obvious yet lovable, and the general message is the old-fashioned, much used one of overcoming opposition. However, since when are those things a crime? Cool Runnings may not break new ground in the film world, but what it does it does very well, and if you don't find yourself caught up cheering along the team then I mourn for the death of the child in you.
