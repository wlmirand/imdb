    Adapting stage plays to the screen is a process fraught with all sorts of dangers; decisions constantly must be made as to how faithful to make the adaptation. Sometimes a very courageous director will simply give the film audience basically the same thing the stage audience saw (as with THE BOYS IN THE BAND or THE BAD SEED); others will "open up" the play to make it more cinematic; the results there tend to vary from brilliant (CABARET, for example) to awful (A CHORUS LINE). Director Sean Mathias's film version of Martin Sherman's landmark play BENT is a harrowing look at the fate of the Gay community under Nazism told through the eyes of Max (Clive Owen), a promiscuous habitu&eacute; of the boy bars who is arrested along with his boyfriend Rudy (Brian Webber) the morning after bringing home a member of the SA (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). On the way to Dachau Max is forced to beat Rudy to death by the brutal SS guards to prove his claim that he is not homosexual; Max has decided that a yellow star (Jewish) would be less dangerous a marker than a pink triangle. In the early scenes of the film we are given a look at the Berlin club scene; Mick Jagger has a stunning cameo as Greta, a performer at the club who knows what's coming and makes an abortive attempt to warn Max, but Max won't listen; neither will he listen to his uncle Freddie (Ian McKellen), an older and more discreet man who satisfies his desires in secret with rent boys. Freddie manages to get faked papers for Max but he will not leave without Rudy, and tragically, this decision spells doom ultimately for both of them. The second half of the story focuses on Max at Dachau; he is paired with another Gay prisoner, Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), and together they are made to move heavy stones from one pile to another and back again, and again, and again. Under the incredibly dehumanizing circumstances, these two men somehow manage to fall in love; and the result is one of the most remarkable and painful love stories ever put on film. Unfortunately, you have to wait nearly an hour to get to the story of Max and Horst, which is the segment of the film that has all the power and impact of Sherman's play. The first half, despite cutting out huge chunks of dialogue, seems interminable and lacks energy; one feels that had they kept the play's first half intact it would have taken about half an hour less to get to Dachau, which is where the beating heart of the story is located. The acting is wonderful, though. Clive Owen, brought in to fill Richard Gere's shoes (Gere had played the role on Broadway but was doing another film at the time), displays a haunting vulnerability as the terrified Max, and Lothaire Bluteau's Horst is in many ways the central figure of the piece, as he stands for what happens when love and hate collide. Bluteau bares his soul in probably the best performance in the picture, though he is in very good company. I give this one a 6 because what it does well, it does exceptionally well. It's a pity that the first half is so dull; the original was anything but.

    By coincidence, I was reading "Double Life: A Love Story from Broadway to Hollywood" at the same time that I saw this movie. It will undoubtedly seem a stretch to compare the lives of a well-off creative gay couple in America to a pair of homosexual inmates in the extraordinarily brutal circumstances of a Nazi concentration camp, but during the very well acted parts of the film where Clive Owen stood next to Lothaire Bluteau and they were able to "make love" without touching or doing anything obvious to anyone watching, it did seem remarkably similar to the life the American couple led for so many years. They too could never touch or show affection in public. In New York they lived separately and one had a marriage of convenience to a lesbian in order to survive professionally. Even after they eventually lived together and despite the fact that most people knew they were living together, for many social and business events they would never attend together and usually appeared with a woman "date." Even in Hollywood, of all places, for one of the men to get anywhere as a movie studio executive, any public evidence of their gay relationship had to be kept hidden awayÂ… and for that matter, most of the Jews in Hollywood during that time kept their Jewish identity hidden as well. What I saw in this movie was less to do with the Nazis specifically and more to do with the survival of emotional stability and of love in a hostile environment that refuses to accept that love can even exist. Even for the American couple, life was only tolerable when they did everything they could to conceal their love and their relationship for much of their 50 years together. And it wasn't just a matter of personal convenience. One was entrapped and arrested in a public toilet. The other was robbed and threatened with death by a pair of men whose main motivation was their loathing for "faggots." Blackmail overt and subtle existed throughout their lives. Yes, the movie was set in Nazi Germany, the epitome of all that's evil, but the message isn't meant simply as a historical reference. The freedom to be who you are and to love who you choose is still held hostage by the official and unofficial suppression of minorities, whether it's in places like Iran or Uganda or even in Middle America. Just because we aren't forced to wear striped uniforms or yellow/pink badges doesn't mean that we're free. The suicide rate amongst young gay people in America ought to be a call for change, but it's dismissed just as what happened to gays in Nazi Germany is ignored. You can choose to view this movie as a further indictment of the Nazis or you can see it as a much broader statement.

    I love historical dramas. This subject matter is very rarely talked about. Jews, poles, gypsies and other undesirables were all brutally exterminated. Homosexuals are very rarely talked about. So this subject matter seemed very interesting. From the start the movie seemed like it was going to be a musical, and i almost turned it off. Then it seemed to try to be a rip off of "party Monsters" but set in pre ww II Germany. The action seemed to get better and the story line started to develop. However the acting and the plot just falls apart, into something predictable and bland. The whole movie seems like someone who wrote a high school play was suddenly given a big movie budget but decided to keep it in a play format.

    The wonderful thing about art in general is that it is not created to simply cause sheer pleasure; therefore it can be good without necessarily being pleasant. 'Bent' is a textbook example for such. I saw the movie as an unconventional love story, set in Germany during the Holocaust era. Max (Owen Wilson) is a homosexual man living in Berlin with his dancer lover Rudy (Brian Webber), and indulging himself into an affair with a Nazi officer. Soon the Nazis track down this officer and slit his throat as a punishment. Shocked, Max and Rudy flee their flat and live in the woods, light years away from their previous lifestyle. However, they are found by Nazis and are transported to the Dachau concentration camp. The train ride is where the prisoners' spirits are first broken, as Max is forced to kill Rudy and have sex with a young girl in order to get the yellow star (signifying he's a Jew) instead of the pink triangle (which is for homosexuals). What originally motivates him is the sound advice of a more experienced gay captive, Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), who makes it clear to him that everyone is on his own and that there is no lower rank among the prisoners than having to wear the pink triangle. In a haunting sentence, Horst says: "If you want to stay alive, you cannot exist." Once in Dachau, Horst and Max slowly but gradually fall in love despite the inhumane conditions and hardships they have to endure. Director Sean Mathias made sure the train ride is seen as long and frightening trip to hell by portraying it as a machine of terror, aptly using black-and-white imagery and sound effects. He also did a wonderful job at capturing the desolate condition of Dachau by focusing on the iron gates buzzing with electricity. Though war is not explicitly dealt with, the scenarios were carefully selected to reflect the deprived sense of chaos, desperation, hunger and hopelessness. The background music, entirely played by classical instruments, also added to this effect and fit the purpose perfectly. Especially in the first half an hour the characters seem to be overly (melo)dramatic. The gay nightlife seems to be a glittering mess of orgies, with strange but artsy men and women (though mainly men) exchanging bodily fluids as it would be the sole purpose of their existence. I had a bit of a problem with that, because to me those scenes showed no real purpose. They brought out the fact that there were homosexuals also among the Nazis, and it also served as a great contrast to the Dachau environment, but I would have loved it if the story would have allowed a glimpse into another aspect of Max's life aside from sex and parties. However, in a play this underground eroticism must have had a different and perhaps stronger effect than on screen. I simply was looking for something more to Max in the first third of the movie. However, Clive Owen was so amazing that even this is forgivable. I watched him open-mouthed as he delivered the one-hundred-percent credible character of Max to the audience. It seems to me that he was born to bring to life the strong, direct, and at times shocking dialogue that was evident throughout the movie (another example for this would be his role in 'Closer'). I think if I were to read the script, I could not imagine anyone else as Max's voice but Clive Owen. He was a perfect choice. I must also point out and praise the brief yet powerful appearances of several other great artists and actors, such as Mick Jagger as the transvestite Greta, Ian McKellen as Uncle Freddie, Jude Law as the storm trooper, his former wife Sadie Frost as Max's friend, and Rachel Weisz as a prostitute. The viewer only begins to understand Horst well into the movie, when him and Max are assigned for the senseless act of piling stones (and later on snow) from one place to the other. At first he is very rejecting, but then he proves to be a very sensitive person, crushed by the weight of human cruelty. His love and longing for Max is very honest and direct, and despite the unspeakable circumstances, there was something romantic about their growing affection for one another. I absolutely loved the scene when they first 'make love' without touching, without even looking at each other, simply by using words and their imagination to reach out. There was something deeply sad about it, and yet it also managed to show just how ridiculous and meaningless the entire concept of the Holocaust was. It seemed to me that Max undergoes a tremendous change by the end of the movie. He goes from being an irresponsible pretty 'fluff' to a caring, strong man who realizes it is more important to be what he is (or symbolically wear the pink triangle) than it is to be alive without existing. His character shows the audience that surviving without being able to exist is just as meaningless as piling stones from one heap to the other. As I mentioned in the beginning, this movie is not pleasant to watch. Though at times it was disturbing, this movie opened my eyes to the wide range of victims the Nazi regime tortured and killed. It puts the focus on homosexual Holocaust victims, and I find that a very rare thing. What made it so heartbreaking was that I know that Max's story does not fall far from the horrid truth WWII presented to millions. Nonetheless, 'Bent' is a good movie, because it shows something true, if ever so painful.

    Powerful, delicate, strange. Slices of stories and one character. A film about love, deep refuges and truth. An ashes lake. It is not a film about the gay life in Nazi period. It is only invitation to choose. And to make the words basic facts. That is all. The movie, and the play, is more than a picture of a form of reality. It is more than a testimony, accusation or manifesto. It is reflection of many forms of silence. About the life as an old apple. About the evening without any morning. About the night of gestures and sleep of feelings. "Bent" is great for the traces after its end. Everybody may be Max or Horst or Rudy or the sadistic Nazi. It is simple. Cruel of simple. But this mirror of personal soul is more a game, more a joke. It is not a complicated film. In fact, it is another old Greek tragedy. A tragedy without end. Must see!

    I was an extra in this film, when I was 11 or 12 years old. I'm 24 now, but at the time I was a member of a local casting agency and me and another friend Lee found ourselves as part of the small group of children that had to paddle about in the water in the scene where the soldiers and prisoners march by. From what I recall it was a days worth of filming and I had to have my step cut out from my hair (it was the style back then!)but it was a really interesting experience. I remember the day being boiling hot but being treated really nicely by the production staff. It makes me laugh now at how blaze I was that this film starred the talents of Sir Ian McKellen and Clive Owen amongst others, but as an 11 year old I didn't know who they were! I was disappointed not to be credited at the end, that would have really proved to my friends that I have been in a film (albeit a very very small blink and you miss it moment!).

    No person who is knowledgeable about the Holocaust can ever claim that without seeing Bent. The play which opened in 1979 in London is about those all too forgotten victims of the Holocaust, the gay people of Europe. On Broadway the lead role that Clive Owen plays was essayed by Richard Gere for the run of 241 performances in the 1979-1980 season. Doing his original role from the London production as Uncle Freddie is Sir Ian McKellan. For those who think that homosexuality doesn't have an inherited element in it, Bent certainly gives lie to that. During the Weimar Republic years Germany had a thriving gay if somewhat discreet scene. After the Night of the Long Knives with the SA purge in 1934, gays were systematically rounded up for a final solution and Hitler certainly did a thorough job of it. Today the German Federal Republic has once again a thriving gay scene. Those recessive genes are popping out in full force. Bent does begin right at the Night of the Long Knives where Ernst Roehm was killed and anyone whoever knew of him and his not so discreet gay lifestyle was done in. The long knives of Himmler's SS come calling that night on Clive Owen and his boyfriend Brian Webber because they've picked up a pretty young man who used to trick with Roehm. He dies quite gruesomely, but they escape. Owen seeks aid from an old gay man who's called Uncle Freddie played by Ian McKellan who gives him some help, but whom Owen doesn't take some good advice from. McKellan has been very much deep in the closet, it's what's made him survive a society where homophobia is not just approved, but is now the law of the land. After this the scene cuts to a train to Dachau and Dachau itself where Owen and Webber are taken. Webber doesn't survive the trip, that scene is something I don't want to reveal. Owen decides that he'll take the Jewish star of David rather than a pink triangle, in the Dachau pecking order gay is worse than Jewish. Just as Schindler's List showed the dehumanization of Jews, Bent shows the dehumanization of gay people. Only there was no Oskar Schindler to save some of them. In fact sexuality as a form of repression has not ever been better displayed on screen than in Bent. But Owen learns about gay pride from another prisoner, Lothaire Bluteau who wears the pink triangle in defiance. They find a connection and consummate that connection in the only way they can do it under the circumstances. Again a scene I can't reveal. This film should not be missed by any Gay/Lesbian/Bi-Sexual/Trangendered person on this planet. It shows better than anything else what we potentially face in the way of repression when we are dehumanized by law and societal mores. We cannot let that happen and we have to make sure it's stopped in the places it does happen in the world. And this review is dedicated to all the brothers and sisters who died back then. Here's hope for a better world for our next generation.

    Nazi-era playboy Clive Owen (as Max) and his dancer lover Brian Webber (as Rudy) are pursued by Nazis, after Mr. Owen is picked up by blond hunk Nikolaj Waldau (as Wolf), in a gay club. After being captured, Owen and Mr. Weber are tortured, on a train to Germany's first concentration camp, at Dachau. Also on the train, Owen meets Lothaire Bluteau (as Horst). Mr. Bluteau wears the "Pink Triangle" identifying him as a homosexual, which is considered an especially low form of human life, by the Nazis. To avoid being beaten to death, Owen pretends to be Jewish, and is given the identifying "Yellow Star". At the concentration camp, prisoners Owen and Bluteau fall in love; but, they must avoid any physical contact. The opening club/orgy sequence is presented in a disjointed, confusing fashion. It's hard to figure out what is going on -- you should, if possible, play the opening (up until the Nazis bust into Owen's pad) twice. The cast is enhanced by cross-dressing Mick Jagger (as Greta), and the original 1979 stage production's "Max", Ian McKellen (as Uncle Freddie). Mr. Jagger also sings the haunting theme "Streets of Berlin". Director Sean Mathias and supporting actor Webber make excellent first impressions; it's strange to see so little work (film credits) immediately followed this production. This film version of Martin Sherman's "forbidden" love story is far from perfect; but, it's still quite captivating. The extent of "man's inhumanity to man" is, as always, horrifying. The film's non-physical sex scene, performed at the concentration camp, is extremely touching. ******* Bent (1997) Sean Mathias ~ Clive Owen, Lothaire Bluteau, Mick Jagger

    "Bent" is an interesting little Holocaust-film curio (based on a stage production) that looks at the death camps from a homosexual perspective. It is intermittently affecting overall, but has its moments of pretension and self-indulgence (the baroque, decadent opening in Berlin comes to mind); the film can't really shake its stage roots, either, as reflected in certain scene setups (Ian McKellen's cameo in the park feels especially artificial). While conflicted over "Bent"'s seesaw of moments both powerful and superficial, I wound up liking it. Max (Clive Owen) is a member of Berlin's decadent gay underworld before World War II; when the Germans invade, he is promptly shipped off to a labor camp. Along the way, he meets Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), a fellow prisoner who's homosexual; as the duo stacks rocks in blazing summer and freezing winter, they strike up an unconventional love affair (standing still during a 3-minute break every 2 hours, they make love verbally (and literally); these scenes are greatly affecting, with Owen and Bluteau fully convincing us of their passion. Several years before he became a household name, Owen really proved his capabilities here. Though "Bent" treads to an achingly symbolic conclusion, the effort--for the most part--is worth seeing the whole way through.

Soon the Nazis track down this officer and slit his throat as a punishment. Shocked, Max and Rudy flee their flat and live in the woods, light years away from their previous lifestyle. However, they are found by Nazis and are transported to the Dachau concentration camp. The train ride is where the prisoners' spirits are first broken, as Max is forced to kill Rudy and have sex with a young girl in order to get the yellow star (signifying he's a Jew) instead of the pink triangle (which is for homosexuals). What originally motivates him is the sound advice of a more experienced gay captive, Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), who makes it clear to him that everyone is on his own and that there is no lower rank among the prisoners than having to wear the pink triangle. In a haunting sentence, Horst says: "If you want to stay alive, you cannot exist." Once in Dachau, Horst and Max slowly but gradually fall in love despite the inhumane conditions and hardships they have to endure. Director Sean Mathias made sure the train ride is seen as long and frightening trip to hell by portraying it as a machine of terror, aptly using black-and-white imagery and sound effects. He also did a wonderful job at capturing the desolate condition of Dachau by focusing on the iron gates buzzing with electricity. Though war is not explicitly dealt with, the scenarios were carefully selected to reflect the deprived sense of chaos, desperation, hunger and hopelessness. The background music, entirely played by classical instruments, also added to this effect and fit the purpose perfectly. Especially in the first half an hour the characters seem to be overly (melo)dramatic. The gay nightlife seems to be a glittering mess of orgies, with strange but artsy men and women (though mainly men) exchanging bodily fluids as it would be the sole purpose of their existence. I had a bit of a problem with that, because to me those scenes showed no real purpose. They brought out the fact that there were homosexuals also among the Nazis, and it also served as a great contrast to the Dachau environment, but I would have loved it if the story would have allowed a glimpse into another aspect of Max's life aside from sex and parties. However, in a play this underground eroticism must have had a different and perhaps stronger effect than on screen. I simply was looking for something more to Max in the first third of the movie. However, Clive Owen was so amazing that even this is forgivable. I watched him open-mouthed as he delivered the one-hundred-percent credible character of Max to the audience. It seems to me that he was born to bring to life the strong, direct, and at times shocking dialogue that was evident throughout the movie (another example for this would be his role in 'Closer'). I think if I were to read the script, I could not imagine anyone else as Max's voice but Clive Owen. He was a perfect choice. I must also point out and praise the brief yet powerful appearances of several other great artists and actors, such as Mick Jagger as the transvestite Greta, Ian McKellen as Uncle Freddie, Jude Law as the storm trooper, his former wife Sadie Frost as Max's friend, and Rachel Weisz as a prostitute. The viewer only begins to understand Horst well into the movie, when him and Max are assigned for the senseless act of piling stones (and later on snow) from one place to the other. At first he is very rejecting, but then he proves to be a very sensitive person, crushed by the weight of human cruelty. His love and longing for Max is very honest and direct, and despite the unspeakable circumstances, there was something romantic about their growing affection for one another. I absolutely loved the scene when they first 'make love' without touching, without even looking at each other, simply by using words and their imagination to reach out. There was something deeply sad about it, and yet it also managed to show just how ridiculous and meaningless the entire concept of the Holocaust was. It seemed to me that Max undergoes a tremendous change by the end of the movie. He goes from being an irresponsible pretty 'fluff' to a caring, strong man who realizes it is more important to be what he is (or symbolically wear the pink triangle) than it is to be alive without existing. His character shows the audience that surviving without being able to exist is just as meaningless as piling stones from one heap to the other. As I mentioned in the beginning, this movie is not pleasant to watch. Though at times it was disturbing, this movie opened my eyes to the wide range of victims the Nazi regime tortured and killed. It puts the focus on homosexual Holocaust victims, and I find that a very rare thing. What made it so heartbreaking was that I know that Max's story does not fall far from the horrid truth WWII presented to millions. Nonetheless, 'Bent' is a good movie, because it shows something true, if ever so painful.

    Powerful, delicate, strange. Slices of stories and one character. A film about love, deep refuges and truth. An ashes lake. It is not a film about the gay life in Nazi period. It is only invitation to choose. And to make the words basic facts. That is all. The movie, and the play, is more than a picture of a form of reality. It is more than a testimony, accusation or manifesto. It is reflection of many forms of silence. About the life as an old apple. About the evening without any morning. About the night of gestures and sleep of feelings. "Bent" is great for the traces after its end. Everybody may be Max or Horst or Rudy or the sadistic Nazi. It is simple. Cruel of simple. But this mirror of personal soul is more a game, more a joke. It is not a complicated film. In fact, it is another old Greek tragedy. A tragedy without end. Must see!

    I was an extra in this film, when I was 11 or 12 years old. I'm 24 now, but at the time I was a member of a local casting agency and me and another friend Lee found ourselves as part of the small group of children that had to paddle about in the water in the scene where the soldiers and prisoners march by. From what I recall it was a days worth of filming and I had to have my step cut out from my hair (it was the style back then!)but it was a really interesting experience. I remember the day being boiling hot but being treated really nicely by the production staff. It makes me laugh now at how blaze I was that this film starred the talents of Sir Ian McKellen and Clive Owen amongst others, but as an 11 year old I didn't know who they were! I was disappointed not to be credited at the end, that would have really proved to my friends that I have been in a film (albeit a very very small blink and you miss it moment!).

    No person who is knowledgeable about the Holocaust can ever claim that without seeing Bent. The play which opened in 1979 in London is about those all too forgotten victims of the Holocaust, the gay people of Europe. On Broadway the lead role that Clive Owen plays was essayed by Richard Gere for the run of 241 performances in the 1979-1980 season. Doing his original role from the London production as Uncle Freddie is Sir Ian McKellan. For those who think that homosexuality doesn't have an inherited element in it, Bent certainly gives lie to that. During the Weimar Republic years Germany had a thriving gay if somewhat discreet scene. After the Night of the Long Knives with the SA purge in 1934, gays were systematically rounded up for a final solution and Hitler certainly did a thorough job of it. Today the German Federal Republic has once again a thriving gay scene. Those recessive genes are popping out in full force. Bent does begin right at the Night of the Long Knives where Ernst Roehm was killed and anyone whoever knew of him and his not so discreet gay lifestyle was done in. The long knives of Himmler's SS come calling that night on Clive Owen and his boyfriend Brian Webber because they've picked up a pretty young man who used to trick with Roehm. He dies quite gruesomely, but they escape. Owen seeks aid from an old gay man who's called Uncle Freddie played by Ian McKellan who gives him some help, but whom Owen doesn't take some good advice from. McKellan has been very much deep in the closet, it's what's made him survive a society where homophobia is not just approved, but is now the law of the land. After this the scene cuts to a train to Dachau and Dachau itself where Owen and Webber are taken. Webber doesn't survive the trip, that scene is something I don't want to reveal. Owen decides that he'll take the Jewish star of David rather than a pink triangle, in the Dachau pecking order gay is worse than Jewish. Just as Schindler's List showed the dehumanization of Jews, Bent shows the dehumanization of gay people. Only there was no Oskar Schindler to save some of them. In fact sexuality as a form of repression has not ever been better displayed on screen than in Bent. But Owen learns about gay pride from another prisoner, Lothaire Bluteau who wears the pink triangle in defiance. They find a connection and consummate that connection in the only way they can do it under the circumstances. Again a scene I can't reveal. This film should not be missed by any Gay/Lesbian/Bi-Sexual/Trangendered person on this planet. It shows better than anything else what we potentially face in the way of repression when we are dehumanized by law and societal mores. We cannot let that happen and we have to make sure it's stopped in the places it does happen in the world. And this review is dedicated to all the brothers and sisters who died back then. Here's hope for a better world for our next generation.

    Nazi-era playboy Clive Owen (as Max) and his dancer lover Brian Webber (as Rudy) are pursued by Nazis, after Mr. Owen is picked up by blond hunk Nikolaj Waldau (as Wolf), in a gay club. After being captured, Owen and Mr. Weber are tortured, on a train to Germany's first concentration camp, at Dachau. Also on the train, Owen meets Lothaire Bluteau (as Horst). Mr. Bluteau wears the "Pink Triangle" identifying him as a homosexual, which is considered an especially low form of human life, by the Nazis. To avoid being beaten to death, Owen pretends to be Jewish, and is given the identifying "Yellow Star". At the concentration camp, prisoners Owen and Bluteau fall in love; but, they must avoid any physical contact. The opening club/orgy sequence is presented in a disjointed, confusing fashion. It's hard to figure out what is going on -- you should, if possible, play the opening (up until the Nazis bust into Owen's pad) twice. The cast is enhanced by cross-dressing Mick Jagger (as Greta), and the original 1979 stage production's "Max", Ian McKellen (as Uncle Freddie). Mr. Jagger also sings the haunting theme "Streets of Berlin". Director Sean Mathias and supporting actor Webber make excellent first impressions; it's strange to see so little work (film credits) immediately followed this production. This film version of Martin Sherman's "forbidden" love story is far from perfect; but, it's still quite captivating. The extent of "man's inhumanity to man" is, as always, horrifying. The film's non-physical sex scene, performed at the concentration camp, is extremely touching. ******* Bent (1997) Sean Mathias ~ Clive Owen, Lothaire Bluteau, Mick Jagger

    "Bent" is an interesting little Holocaust-film curio (based on a stage production) that looks at the death camps from a homosexual perspective. It is intermittently affecting overall, but has its moments of pretension and self-indulgence (the baroque, decadent opening in Berlin comes to mind); the film can't really shake its stage roots, either, as reflected in certain scene setups (Ian McKellen's cameo in the park feels especially artificial). While conflicted over "Bent"'s seesaw of moments both powerful and superficial, I wound up liking it. Max (Clive Owen) is a member of Berlin's decadent gay underworld before World War II; when the Germans invade, he is promptly shipped off to a labor camp. Along the way, he meets Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), a fellow prisoner who's homosexual; as the duo stacks rocks in blazing summer and freezing winter, they strike up an unconventional love affair (standing still during a 3-minute break every 2 hours, they make love verbally (and literally); these scenes are greatly affecting, with Owen and Bluteau fully convincing us of their passion. Several years before he became a household name, Owen really proved his capabilities here. Though "Bent" treads to an achingly symbolic conclusion, the effort--for the most part--is worth seeing the whole way through.

    Adapting stage plays to the screen is a process fraught with all sorts of dangers; decisions constantly must be made as to how faithful to make the adaptation. Sometimes a very courageous director will simply give the film audience basically the same thing the stage audience saw (as with THE BOYS IN THE BAND or THE BAD SEED); others will "open up" the play to make it more cinematic; the results there tend to vary from brilliant (CABARET, for example) to awful (A CHORUS LINE). Director Sean Mathias's film version of Martin Sherman's landmark play BENT is a harrowing look at the fate of the Gay community under Nazism told through the eyes of Max (Clive Owen), a promiscuous habitu&eacute; of the boy bars who is arrested along with his boyfriend Rudy (Brian Webber) the morning after bringing home a member of the SA (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). On the way to Dachau Max is forced to beat Rudy to death by the brutal SS guards to prove his claim that he is not homosexual; Max has decided that a yellow star (Jewish) would be less dangerous a marker than a pink triangle. In the early scenes of the film we are given a look at the Berlin club scene; Mick Jagger has a stunning cameo as Greta, a performer at the club who knows what's coming and makes an abortive attempt to warn Max, but Max won't listen; neither will he listen to his uncle Freddie (Ian McKellen), an older and more discreet man who satisfies his desires in secret with rent boys. Freddie manages to get faked papers for Max but he will not leave without Rudy, and tragically, this decision spells doom ultimately for both of them. The second half of the story focuses on Max at Dachau; he is paired with another Gay prisoner, Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), and together they are made to move heavy stones from one pile to another and back again, and again, and again. Under the incredibly dehumanizing circumstances, these two men somehow manage to fall in love; and the result is one of the most remarkable and painful love stories ever put on film. Unfortunately, you have to wait nearly an hour to get to the story of Max and Horst, which is the segment of the film that has all the power and impact of Sherman's play. The first half, despite cutting out huge chunks of dialogue, seems interminable and lacks energy; one feels that had they kept the play's first half intact it would have taken about half an hour less to get to Dachau, which is where the beating heart of the story is located. The acting is wonderful, though. Clive Owen, brought in to fill Richard Gere's shoes (Gere had played the role on Broadway but was doing another film at the time), displays a haunting vulnerability as the terrified Max, and Lothaire Bluteau's Horst is in many ways the central figure of the piece, as he stands for what happens when love and hate collide. Bluteau bares his soul in probably the best performance in the picture, though he is in very good company. I give this one a 6 because what it does well, it does exceptionally well. It's a pity that the first half is so dull; the original was anything but.

    By coincidence, I was reading "Double Life: A Love Story from Broadway to Hollywood" at the same time that I saw this movie. It will undoubtedly seem a stretch to compare the lives of a well-off creative gay couple in America to a pair of homosexual inmates in the extraordinarily brutal circumstances of a Nazi concentration camp, but during the very well acted parts of the film where Clive Owen stood next to Lothaire Bluteau and they were able to "make love" without touching or doing anything obvious to anyone watching, it did seem remarkably similar to the life the American couple led for so many years. They too could never touch or show affection in public. In New York they lived separately and one had a marriage of convenience to a lesbian in order to survive professionally. Even after they eventually lived together and despite the fact that most people knew they were living together, for many social and business events they would never attend together and usually appeared with a woman "date." Even in Hollywood, of all places, for one of the men to get anywhere as a movie studio executive, any public evidence of their gay relationship had to be kept hidden awayÂ… and for that matter, most of the Jews in Hollywood during that time kept their Jewish identity hidden as well. What I saw in this movie was less to do with the Nazis specifically and more to do with the survival of emotional stability and of love in a hostile environment that refuses to accept that love can even exist. Even for the American couple, life was only tolerable when they did everything they could to conceal their love and their relationship for much of their 50 years together. And it wasn't just a matter of personal convenience. One was entrapped and arrested in a public toilet. The other was robbed and threatened with death by a pair of men whose main motivation was their loathing for "faggots." Blackmail overt and subtle existed throughout their lives. Yes, the movie was set in Nazi Germany, the epitome of all that's evil, but the message isn't meant simply as a historical reference. The freedom to be who you are and to love who you choose is still held hostage by the official and unofficial suppression of minorities, whether it's in places like Iran or Uganda or even in Middle America. Just because we aren't forced to wear striped uniforms or yellow/pink badges doesn't mean that we're free. The suicide rate amongst young gay people in America ought to be a call for change, but it's dismissed just as what happened to gays in Nazi Germany is ignored. You can choose to view this movie as a further indictment of the Nazis or you can see it as a much broader statement.

    I love historical dramas. This subject matter is very rarely talked about. Jews, poles, gypsies and other undesirables were all brutally exterminated. Homosexuals are very rarely talked about. So this subject matter seemed very interesting. From the start the movie seemed like it was going to be a musical, and i almost turned it off. Then it seemed to try to be a rip off of "party Monsters" but set in pre ww II Germany. The action seemed to get better and the story line started to develop. However the acting and the plot just falls apart, into something predictable and bland. The whole movie seems like someone who wrote a high school play was suddenly given a big movie budget but decided to keep it in a play format.

    The wonderful thing about art in general is that it is not created to simply cause sheer pleasure; therefore it can be good without necessarily being pleasant. 'Bent' is a textbook example for such. I saw the movie as an unconventional love story, set in Germany during the Holocaust era. Max (Owen Wilson) is a homosexual man living in Berlin with his dancer lover Rudy (Brian Webber), and indulging himself into an affair with a Nazi officer. Soon the Nazis track down this officer and slit his throat as a punishment. Shocked, Max and Rudy flee their flat and live in the woods, light years away from their previous lifestyle. However, they are found by Nazis and are transported to the Dachau concentration camp. The train ride is where the prisoners' spirits are first broken, as Max is forced to kill Rudy and have sex with a young girl in order to get the yellow star (signifying he's a Jew) instead of the pink triangle (which is for homosexuals). What originally motivates him is the sound advice of a more experienced gay captive, Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), who makes it clear to him that everyone is on his own and that there is no lower rank among the prisoners than having to wear the pink triangle.

It shows better than anything else what we potentially face in the way of repression when we are dehumanized by law and societal mores. We cannot let that happen and we have to make sure it's stopped in the places it does happen in the world. And this review is dedicated to all the brothers and sisters who died back then. Here's hope for a better world for our next generation.

    Nazi-era playboy Clive Owen (as Max) and his dancer lover Brian Webber (as Rudy) are pursued by Nazis, after Mr. Owen is picked up by blond hunk Nikolaj Waldau (as Wolf), in a gay club. After being captured, Owen and Mr. Weber are tortured, on a train to Germany's first concentration camp, at Dachau. Also on the train, Owen meets Lothaire Bluteau (as Horst). Mr. Bluteau wears the "Pink Triangle" identifying him as a homosexual, which is considered an especially low form of human life, by the Nazis. To avoid being beaten to death, Owen pretends to be Jewish, and is given the identifying "Yellow Star". At the concentration camp, prisoners Owen and Bluteau fall in love; but, they must avoid any physical contact. The opening club/orgy sequence is presented in a disjointed, confusing fashion. It's hard to figure out what is going on -- you should, if possible, play the opening (up until the Nazis bust into Owen's pad) twice. The cast is enhanced by cross-dressing Mick Jagger (as Greta), and the original 1979 stage production's "Max", Ian McKellen (as Uncle Freddie). Mr. Jagger also sings the haunting theme "Streets of Berlin". Director Sean Mathias and supporting actor Webber make excellent first impressions; it's strange to see so little work (film credits) immediately followed this production. This film version of Martin Sherman's "forbidden" love story is far from perfect; but, it's still quite captivating. The extent of "man's inhumanity to man" is, as always, horrifying. The film's non-physical sex scene, performed at the concentration camp, is extremely touching. ******* Bent (1997) Sean Mathias ~ Clive Owen, Lothaire Bluteau, Mick Jagger

    "Bent" is an interesting little Holocaust-film curio (based on a stage production) that looks at the death camps from a homosexual perspective. It is intermittently affecting overall, but has its moments of pretension and self-indulgence (the baroque, decadent opening in Berlin comes to mind); the film can't really shake its stage roots, either, as reflected in certain scene setups (Ian McKellen's cameo in the park feels especially artificial). While conflicted over "Bent"'s seesaw of moments both powerful and superficial, I wound up liking it. Max (Clive Owen) is a member of Berlin's decadent gay underworld before World War II; when the Germans invade, he is promptly shipped off to a labor camp. Along the way, he meets Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), a fellow prisoner who's homosexual; as the duo stacks rocks in blazing summer and freezing winter, they strike up an unconventional love affair (standing still during a 3-minute break every 2 hours, they make love verbally (and literally); these scenes are greatly affecting, with Owen and Bluteau fully convincing us of their passion. Several years before he became a household name, Owen really proved his capabilities here. Though "Bent" treads to an achingly symbolic conclusion, the effort--for the most part--is worth seeing the whole way through.

    Adapting stage plays to the screen is a process fraught with all sorts of dangers; decisions constantly must be made as to how faithful to make the adaptation. Sometimes a very courageous director will simply give the film audience basically the same thing the stage audience saw (as with THE BOYS IN THE BAND or THE BAD SEED); others will "open up" the play to make it more cinematic; the results there tend to vary from brilliant (CABARET, for example) to awful (A CHORUS LINE). Director Sean Mathias's film version of Martin Sherman's landmark play BENT is a harrowing look at the fate of the Gay community under Nazism told through the eyes of Max (Clive Owen), a promiscuous habitu&eacute; of the boy bars who is arrested along with his boyfriend Rudy (Brian Webber) the morning after bringing home a member of the SA (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). On the way to Dachau Max is forced to beat Rudy to death by the brutal SS guards to prove his claim that he is not homosexual; Max has decided that a yellow star (Jewish) would be less dangerous a marker than a pink triangle. In the early scenes of the film we are given a look at the Berlin club scene; Mick Jagger has a stunning cameo as Greta, a performer at the club who knows what's coming and makes an abortive attempt to warn Max, but Max won't listen; neither will he listen to his uncle Freddie (Ian McKellen), an older and more discreet man who satisfies his desires in secret with rent boys. Freddie manages to get faked papers for Max but he will not leave without Rudy, and tragically, this decision spells doom ultimately for both of them. The second half of the story focuses on Max at Dachau; he is paired with another Gay prisoner, Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), and together they are made to move heavy stones from one pile to another and back again, and again, and again. Under the incredibly dehumanizing circumstances, these two men somehow manage to fall in love; and the result is one of the most remarkable and painful love stories ever put on film. Unfortunately, you have to wait nearly an hour to get to the story of Max and Horst, which is the segment of the film that has all the power and impact of Sherman's play. The first half, despite cutting out huge chunks of dialogue, seems interminable and lacks energy; one feels that had they kept the play's first half intact it would have taken about half an hour less to get to Dachau, which is where the beating heart of the story is located. The acting is wonderful, though. Clive Owen, brought in to fill Richard Gere's shoes (Gere had played the role on Broadway but was doing another film at the time), displays a haunting vulnerability as the terrified Max, and Lothaire Bluteau's Horst is in many ways the central figure of the piece, as he stands for what happens when love and hate collide. Bluteau bares his soul in probably the best performance in the picture, though he is in very good company. I give this one a 6 because what it does well, it does exceptionally well. It's a pity that the first half is so dull; the original was anything but.

    By coincidence, I was reading "Double Life: A Love Story from Broadway to Hollywood" at the same time that I saw this movie. It will undoubtedly seem a stretch to compare the lives of a well-off creative gay couple in America to a pair of homosexual inmates in the extraordinarily brutal circumstances of a Nazi concentration camp, but during the very well acted parts of the film where Clive Owen stood next to Lothaire Bluteau and they were able to "make love" without touching or doing anything obvious to anyone watching, it did seem remarkably similar to the life the American couple led for so many years. They too could never touch or show affection in public. In New York they lived separately and one had a marriage of convenience to a lesbian in order to survive professionally. Even after they eventually lived together and despite the fact that most people knew they were living together, for many social and business events they would never attend together and usually appeared with a woman "date." Even in Hollywood, of all places, for one of the men to get anywhere as a movie studio executive, any public evidence of their gay relationship had to be kept hidden awayÂ… and for that matter, most of the Jews in Hollywood during that time kept their Jewish identity hidden as well. What I saw in this movie was less to do with the Nazis specifically and more to do with the survival of emotional stability and of love in a hostile environment that refuses to accept that love can even exist. Even for the American couple, life was only tolerable when they did everything they could to conceal their love and their relationship for much of their 50 years together. And it wasn't just a matter of personal convenience. One was entrapped and arrested in a public toilet. The other was robbed and threatened with death by a pair of men whose main motivation was their loathing for "faggots." Blackmail overt and subtle existed throughout their lives. Yes, the movie was set in Nazi Germany, the epitome of all that's evil, but the message isn't meant simply as a historical reference. The freedom to be who you are and to love who you choose is still held hostage by the official and unofficial suppression of minorities, whether it's in places like Iran or Uganda or even in Middle America. Just because we aren't forced to wear striped uniforms or yellow/pink badges doesn't mean that we're free. The suicide rate amongst young gay people in America ought to be a call for change, but it's dismissed just as what happened to gays in Nazi Germany is ignored. You can choose to view this movie as a further indictment of the Nazis or you can see it as a much broader statement.

    I love historical dramas. This subject matter is very rarely talked about. Jews, poles, gypsies and other undesirables were all brutally exterminated. Homosexuals are very rarely talked about. So this subject matter seemed very interesting. From the start the movie seemed like it was going to be a musical, and i almost turned it off. Then it seemed to try to be a rip off of "party Monsters" but set in pre ww II Germany. The action seemed to get better and the story line started to develop. However the acting and the plot just falls apart, into something predictable and bland. The whole movie seems like someone who wrote a high school play was suddenly given a big movie budget but decided to keep it in a play format.

    The wonderful thing about art in general is that it is not created to simply cause sheer pleasure; therefore it can be good without necessarily being pleasant. 'Bent' is a textbook example for such. I saw the movie as an unconventional love story, set in Germany during the Holocaust era. Max (Owen Wilson) is a homosexual man living in Berlin with his dancer lover Rudy (Brian Webber), and indulging himself into an affair with a Nazi officer. Soon the Nazis track down this officer and slit his throat as a punishment. Shocked, Max and Rudy flee their flat and live in the woods, light years away from their previous lifestyle. However, they are found by Nazis and are transported to the Dachau concentration camp. The train ride is where the prisoners' spirits are first broken, as Max is forced to kill Rudy and have sex with a young girl in order to get the yellow star (signifying he's a Jew) instead of the pink triangle (which is for homosexuals). What originally motivates him is the sound advice of a more experienced gay captive, Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), who makes it clear to him that everyone is on his own and that there is no lower rank among the prisoners than having to wear the pink triangle. In a haunting sentence, Horst says: "If you want to stay alive, you cannot exist." Once in Dachau, Horst and Max slowly but gradually fall in love despite the inhumane conditions and hardships they have to endure. Director Sean Mathias made sure the train ride is seen as long and frightening trip to hell by portraying it as a machine of terror, aptly using black-and-white imagery and sound effects. He also did a wonderful job at capturing the desolate condition of Dachau by focusing on the iron gates buzzing with electricity. Though war is not explicitly dealt with, the scenarios were carefully selected to reflect the deprived sense of chaos, desperation, hunger and hopelessness. The background music, entirely played by classical instruments, also added to this effect and fit the purpose perfectly. Especially in the first half an hour the characters seem to be overly (melo)dramatic. The gay nightlife seems to be a glittering mess of orgies, with strange but artsy men and women (though mainly men) exchanging bodily fluids as it would be the sole purpose of their existence. I had a bit of a problem with that, because to me those scenes showed no real purpose. They brought out the fact that there were homosexuals also among the Nazis, and it also served as a great contrast to the Dachau environment, but I would have loved it if the story would have allowed a glimpse into another aspect of Max's life aside from sex and parties. However, in a play this underground eroticism must have had a different and perhaps stronger effect than on screen. I simply was looking for something more to Max in the first third of the movie. However, Clive Owen was so amazing that even this is forgivable. I watched him open-mouthed as he delivered the one-hundred-percent credible character of Max to the audience. It seems to me that he was born to bring to life the strong, direct, and at times shocking dialogue that was evident throughout the movie (another example for this would be his role in 'Closer'). I think if I were to read the script, I could not imagine anyone else as Max's voice but Clive Owen. He was a perfect choice. I must also point out and praise the brief yet powerful appearances of several other great artists and actors, such as Mick Jagger as the transvestite Greta, Ian McKellen as Uncle Freddie, Jude Law as the storm trooper, his former wife Sadie Frost as Max's friend, and Rachel Weisz as a prostitute. The viewer only begins to understand Horst well into the movie, when him and Max are assigned for the senseless act of piling stones (and later on snow) from one place to the other. At first he is very rejecting, but then he proves to be a very sensitive person, crushed by the weight of human cruelty. His love and longing for Max is very honest and direct, and despite the unspeakable circumstances, there was something romantic about their growing affection for one another. I absolutely loved the scene when they first 'make love' without touching, without even looking at each other, simply by using words and their imagination to reach out. There was something deeply sad about it, and yet it also managed to show just how ridiculous and meaningless the entire concept of the Holocaust was. It seemed to me that Max undergoes a tremendous change by the end of the movie. He goes from being an irresponsible pretty 'fluff' to a caring, strong man who realizes it is more important to be what he is (or symbolically wear the pink triangle) than it is to be alive without existing. His character shows the audience that surviving without being able to exist is just as meaningless as piling stones from one heap to the other. As I mentioned in the beginning, this movie is not pleasant to watch. Though at times it was disturbing, this movie opened my eyes to the wide range of victims the Nazi regime tortured and killed. It puts the focus on homosexual Holocaust victims, and I find that a very rare thing. What made it so heartbreaking was that I know that Max's story does not fall far from the horrid truth WWII presented to millions. Nonetheless, 'Bent' is a good movie, because it shows something true, if ever so painful.

    Powerful, delicate, strange. Slices of stories and one character. A film about love, deep refuges and truth. An ashes lake. It is not a film about the gay life in Nazi period. It is only invitation to choose. And to make the words basic facts. That is all. The movie, and the play, is more than a picture of a form of reality. It is more than a testimony, accusation or manifesto. It is reflection of many forms of silence. About the life as an old apple. About the evening without any morning. About the night of gestures and sleep of feelings. "Bent" is great for the traces after its end. Everybody may be Max or Horst or Rudy or the sadistic Nazi. It is simple. Cruel of simple. But this mirror of personal soul is more a game, more a joke. It is not a complicated film. In fact, it is another old Greek tragedy. A tragedy without end. Must see!

    I was an extra in this film, when I was 11 or 12 years old. I'm 24 now, but at the time I was a member of a local casting agency and me and another friend Lee found ourselves as part of the small group of children that had to paddle about in the water in the scene where the soldiers and prisoners march by. From what I recall it was a days worth of filming and I had to have my step cut out from my hair (it was the style back then!)but it was a really interesting experience. I remember the day being boiling hot but being treated really nicely by the production staff. It makes me laugh now at how blaze I was that this film starred the talents of Sir Ian McKellen and Clive Owen amongst others, but as an 11 year old I didn't know who they were! I was disappointed not to be credited at the end, that would have really proved to my friends that I have been in a film (albeit a very very small blink and you miss it moment!).

    No person who is knowledgeable about the Holocaust can ever claim that without seeing Bent. The play which opened in 1979 in London is about those all too forgotten victims of the Holocaust, the gay people of Europe. On Broadway the lead role that Clive Owen plays was essayed by Richard Gere for the run of 241 performances in the 1979-1980 season. Doing his original role from the London production as Uncle Freddie is Sir Ian McKellan. For those who think that homosexuality doesn't have an inherited element in it, Bent certainly gives lie to that. During the Weimar Republic years Germany had a thriving gay if somewhat discreet scene. After the Night of the Long Knives with the SA purge in 1934, gays were systematically rounded up for a final solution and Hitler certainly did a thorough job of it. Today the German Federal Republic has once again a thriving gay scene. Those recessive genes are popping out in full force. Bent does begin right at the Night of the Long Knives where Ernst Roehm was killed and anyone whoever knew of him and his not so discreet gay lifestyle was done in. The long knives of Himmler's SS come calling that night on Clive Owen and his boyfriend Brian Webber because they've picked up a pretty young man who used to trick with Roehm. He dies quite gruesomely, but they escape. Owen seeks aid from an old gay man who's called Uncle Freddie played by Ian McKellan who gives him some help, but whom Owen doesn't take some good advice from. McKellan has been very much deep in the closet, it's what's made him survive a society where homophobia is not just approved, but is now the law of the land. After this the scene cuts to a train to Dachau and Dachau itself where Owen and Webber are taken. Webber doesn't survive the trip, that scene is something I don't want to reveal. Owen decides that he'll take the Jewish star of David rather than a pink triangle, in the Dachau pecking order gay is worse than Jewish. Just as Schindler's List showed the dehumanization of Jews, Bent shows the dehumanization of gay people. Only there was no Oskar Schindler to save some of them. In fact sexuality as a form of repression has not ever been better displayed on screen than in Bent. But Owen learns about gay pride from another prisoner, Lothaire Bluteau who wears the pink triangle in defiance. They find a connection and consummate that connection in the only way they can do it under the circumstances. Again a scene I can't reveal. This film should not be missed by any Gay/Lesbian/Bi-Sexual/Trangendered person on this planet. It shows better than anything else what we potentially face in the way of repression when we are dehumanized by law and societal mores. We cannot let that happen and we have to make sure it's stopped in the places it does happen in the world. And this review is dedicated to all the brothers and sisters who died back then. Here's hope for a better world for our next generation.

What I saw in this movie was less to do with the Nazis specifically and more to do with the survival of emotional stability and of love in a hostile environment that refuses to accept that love can even exist. Even for the American couple, life was only tolerable when they did everything they could to conceal their love and their relationship for much of their 50 years together. And it wasn't just a matter of personal convenience. One was entrapped and arrested in a public toilet. The other was robbed and threatened with death by a pair of men whose main motivation was their loathing for "faggots." Blackmail overt and subtle existed throughout their lives. Yes, the movie was set in Nazi Germany, the epitome of all that's evil, but the message isn't meant simply as a historical reference. The freedom to be who you are and to love who you choose is still held hostage by the official and unofficial suppression of minorities, whether it's in places like Iran or Uganda or even in Middle America. Just because we aren't forced to wear striped uniforms or yellow/pink badges doesn't mean that we're free. The suicide rate amongst young gay people in America ought to be a call for change, but it's dismissed just as what happened to gays in Nazi Germany is ignored. You can choose to view this movie as a further indictment of the Nazis or you can see it as a much broader statement.

    I love historical dramas. This subject matter is very rarely talked about. Jews, poles, gypsies and other undesirables were all brutally exterminated. Homosexuals are very rarely talked about. So this subject matter seemed very interesting. From the start the movie seemed like it was going to be a musical, and i almost turned it off. Then it seemed to try to be a rip off of "party Monsters" but set in pre ww II Germany. The action seemed to get better and the story line started to develop. However the acting and the plot just falls apart, into something predictable and bland. The whole movie seems like someone who wrote a high school play was suddenly given a big movie budget but decided to keep it in a play format.

    The wonderful thing about art in general is that it is not created to simply cause sheer pleasure; therefore it can be good without necessarily being pleasant. 'Bent' is a textbook example for such. I saw the movie as an unconventional love story, set in Germany during the Holocaust era. Max (Owen Wilson) is a homosexual man living in Berlin with his dancer lover Rudy (Brian Webber), and indulging himself into an affair with a Nazi officer. Soon the Nazis track down this officer and slit his throat as a punishment. Shocked, Max and Rudy flee their flat and live in the woods, light years away from their previous lifestyle. However, they are found by Nazis and are transported to the Dachau concentration camp. The train ride is where the prisoners' spirits are first broken, as Max is forced to kill Rudy and have sex with a young girl in order to get the yellow star (signifying he's a Jew) instead of the pink triangle (which is for homosexuals). What originally motivates him is the sound advice of a more experienced gay captive, Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), who makes it clear to him that everyone is on his own and that there is no lower rank among the prisoners than having to wear the pink triangle. In a haunting sentence, Horst says: "If you want to stay alive, you cannot exist." Once in Dachau, Horst and Max slowly but gradually fall in love despite the inhumane conditions and hardships they have to endure. Director Sean Mathias made sure the train ride is seen as long and frightening trip to hell by portraying it as a machine of terror, aptly using black-and-white imagery and sound effects. He also did a wonderful job at capturing the desolate condition of Dachau by focusing on the iron gates buzzing with electricity. Though war is not explicitly dealt with, the scenarios were carefully selected to reflect the deprived sense of chaos, desperation, hunger and hopelessness. The background music, entirely played by classical instruments, also added to this effect and fit the purpose perfectly. Especially in the first half an hour the characters seem to be overly (melo)dramatic. The gay nightlife seems to be a glittering mess of orgies, with strange but artsy men and women (though mainly men) exchanging bodily fluids as it would be the sole purpose of their existence. I had a bit of a problem with that, because to me those scenes showed no real purpose. They brought out the fact that there were homosexuals also among the Nazis, and it also served as a great contrast to the Dachau environment, but I would have loved it if the story would have allowed a glimpse into another aspect of Max's life aside from sex and parties. However, in a play this underground eroticism must have had a different and perhaps stronger effect than on screen. I simply was looking for something more to Max in the first third of the movie. However, Clive Owen was so amazing that even this is forgivable. I watched him open-mouthed as he delivered the one-hundred-percent credible character of Max to the audience. It seems to me that he was born to bring to life the strong, direct, and at times shocking dialogue that was evident throughout the movie (another example for this would be his role in 'Closer'). I think if I were to read the script, I could not imagine anyone else as Max's voice but Clive Owen. He was a perfect choice. I must also point out and praise the brief yet powerful appearances of several other great artists and actors, such as Mick Jagger as the transvestite Greta, Ian McKellen as Uncle Freddie, Jude Law as the storm trooper, his former wife Sadie Frost as Max's friend, and Rachel Weisz as a prostitute. The viewer only begins to understand Horst well into the movie, when him and Max are assigned for the senseless act of piling stones (and later on snow) from one place to the other. At first he is very rejecting, but then he proves to be a very sensitive person, crushed by the weight of human cruelty. His love and longing for Max is very honest and direct, and despite the unspeakable circumstances, there was something romantic about their growing affection for one another. I absolutely loved the scene when they first 'make love' without touching, without even looking at each other, simply by using words and their imagination to reach out. There was something deeply sad about it, and yet it also managed to show just how ridiculous and meaningless the entire concept of the Holocaust was. It seemed to me that Max undergoes a tremendous change by the end of the movie. He goes from being an irresponsible pretty 'fluff' to a caring, strong man who realizes it is more important to be what he is (or symbolically wear the pink triangle) than it is to be alive without existing. His character shows the audience that surviving without being able to exist is just as meaningless as piling stones from one heap to the other. As I mentioned in the beginning, this movie is not pleasant to watch. Though at times it was disturbing, this movie opened my eyes to the wide range of victims the Nazi regime tortured and killed. It puts the focus on homosexual Holocaust victims, and I find that a very rare thing. What made it so heartbreaking was that I know that Max's story does not fall far from the horrid truth WWII presented to millions. Nonetheless, 'Bent' is a good movie, because it shows something true, if ever so painful.

    Powerful, delicate, strange. Slices of stories and one character. A film about love, deep refuges and truth. An ashes lake. It is not a film about the gay life in Nazi period. It is only invitation to choose. And to make the words basic facts. That is all. The movie, and the play, is more than a picture of a form of reality. It is more than a testimony, accusation or manifesto. It is reflection of many forms of silence. About the life as an old apple. About the evening without any morning. About the night of gestures and sleep of feelings. "Bent" is great for the traces after its end. Everybody may be Max or Horst or Rudy or the sadistic Nazi. It is simple. Cruel of simple. But this mirror of personal soul is more a game, more a joke. It is not a complicated film. In fact, it is another old Greek tragedy. A tragedy without end. Must see!

    I was an extra in this film, when I was 11 or 12 years old. I'm 24 now, but at the time I was a member of a local casting agency and me and another friend Lee found ourselves as part of the small group of children that had to paddle about in the water in the scene where the soldiers and prisoners march by. From what I recall it was a days worth of filming and I had to have my step cut out from my hair (it was the style back then!)but it was a really interesting experience. I remember the day being boiling hot but being treated really nicely by the production staff. It makes me laugh now at how blaze I was that this film starred the talents of Sir Ian McKellen and Clive Owen amongst others, but as an 11 year old I didn't know who they were! I was disappointed not to be credited at the end, that would have really proved to my friends that I have been in a film (albeit a very very small blink and you miss it moment!).

    No person who is knowledgeable about the Holocaust can ever claim that without seeing Bent. The play which opened in 1979 in London is about those all too forgotten victims of the Holocaust, the gay people of Europe. On Broadway the lead role that Clive Owen plays was essayed by Richard Gere for the run of 241 performances in the 1979-1980 season. Doing his original role from the London production as Uncle Freddie is Sir Ian McKellan. For those who think that homosexuality doesn't have an inherited element in it, Bent certainly gives lie to that. During the Weimar Republic years Germany had a thriving gay if somewhat discreet scene. After the Night of the Long Knives with the SA purge in 1934, gays were systematically rounded up for a final solution and Hitler certainly did a thorough job of it. Today the German Federal Republic has once again a thriving gay scene. Those recessive genes are popping out in full force. Bent does begin right at the Night of the Long Knives where Ernst Roehm was killed and anyone whoever knew of him and his not so discreet gay lifestyle was done in. The long knives of Himmler's SS come calling that night on Clive Owen and his boyfriend Brian Webber because they've picked up a pretty young man who used to trick with Roehm. He dies quite gruesomely, but they escape. Owen seeks aid from an old gay man who's called Uncle Freddie played by Ian McKellan who gives him some help, but whom Owen doesn't take some good advice from. McKellan has been very much deep in the closet, it's what's made him survive a society where homophobia is not just approved, but is now the law of the land. After this the scene cuts to a train to Dachau and Dachau itself where Owen and Webber are taken. Webber doesn't survive the trip, that scene is something I don't want to reveal. Owen decides that he'll take the Jewish star of David rather than a pink triangle, in the Dachau pecking order gay is worse than Jewish. Just as Schindler's List showed the dehumanization of Jews, Bent shows the dehumanization of gay people. Only there was no Oskar Schindler to save some of them. In fact sexuality as a form of repression has not ever been better displayed on screen than in Bent. But Owen learns about gay pride from another prisoner, Lothaire Bluteau who wears the pink triangle in defiance. They find a connection and consummate that connection in the only way they can do it under the circumstances. Again a scene I can't reveal. This film should not be missed by any Gay/Lesbian/Bi-Sexual/Trangendered person on this planet. It shows better than anything else what we potentially face in the way of repression when we are dehumanized by law and societal mores. We cannot let that happen and we have to make sure it's stopped in the places it does happen in the world. And this review is dedicated to all the brothers and sisters who died back then. Here's hope for a better world for our next generation.

    Nazi-era playboy Clive Owen (as Max) and his dancer lover Brian Webber (as Rudy) are pursued by Nazis, after Mr. Owen is picked up by blond hunk Nikolaj Waldau (as Wolf), in a gay club. After being captured, Owen and Mr. Weber are tortured, on a train to Germany's first concentration camp, at Dachau. Also on the train, Owen meets Lothaire Bluteau (as Horst). Mr. Bluteau wears the "Pink Triangle" identifying him as a homosexual, which is considered an especially low form of human life, by the Nazis. To avoid being beaten to death, Owen pretends to be Jewish, and is given the identifying "Yellow Star". At the concentration camp, prisoners Owen and Bluteau fall in love; but, they must avoid any physical contact. The opening club/orgy sequence is presented in a disjointed, confusing fashion. It's hard to figure out what is going on -- you should, if possible, play the opening (up until the Nazis bust into Owen's pad) twice. The cast is enhanced by cross-dressing Mick Jagger (as Greta), and the original 1979 stage production's "Max", Ian McKellen (as Uncle Freddie). Mr. Jagger also sings the haunting theme "Streets of Berlin". Director Sean Mathias and supporting actor Webber make excellent first impressions; it's strange to see so little work (film credits) immediately followed this production. This film version of Martin Sherman's "forbidden" love story is far from perfect; but, it's still quite captivating. The extent of "man's inhumanity to man" is, as always, horrifying. The film's non-physical sex scene, performed at the concentration camp, is extremely touching. ******* Bent (1997) Sean Mathias ~ Clive Owen, Lothaire Bluteau, Mick Jagger

    The movie is gorgeous! I think. I especially like the part the two guys stood there and make love to each without touching and looking at each other...touching your emotion actually...the desperate suicide committed by the man was unavoidable and sad...'yes, I love you; yes'...a confirmation of love is more than thousands of words...nice movie! 10 lines comments? wow, too critical for a good movie review...the Gettysburg address by Abraham Lincoln was short but convincible!powerful.The movie is gorgeous!

    "Bent" is an interesting little Holocaust-film curio (based on a stage production) that looks at the death camps from a homosexual perspective. It is intermittently affecting overall, but has its moments of pretension and self-indulgence (the baroque, decadent opening in Berlin comes to mind); the film can't really shake its stage roots, either, as reflected in certain scene setups (Ian McKellen's cameo in the park feels especially artificial). While conflicted over "Bent"'s seesaw of moments both powerful and superficial, I wound up liking it. Max (Clive Owen) is a member of Berlin's decadent gay underworld before World War II; when the Germans invade, he is promptly shipped off to a labor camp. Along the way, he meets Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), a fellow prisoner who's homosexual; as the duo stacks rocks in blazing summer and freezing winter, they strike up an unconventional love affair (standing still during a 3-minute break every 2 hours, they make love verbally (and literally); these scenes are greatly affecting, with Owen and Bluteau fully convincing us of their passion. Several years before he became a household name, Owen really proved his capabilities here. Though "Bent" treads to an achingly symbolic conclusion, the effort--for the most part--is worth seeing the whole way through.

    Adapting stage plays to the screen is a process fraught with all sorts of dangers; decisions constantly must be made as to how faithful to make the adaptation. Sometimes a very courageous director will simply give the film audience basically the same thing the stage audience saw (as with THE BOYS IN THE BAND or THE BAD SEED); others will "open up" the play to make it more cinematic; the results there tend to vary from brilliant (CABARET, for example) to awful (A CHORUS LINE). Director Sean Mathias's film version of Martin Sherman's landmark play BENT is a harrowing look at the fate of the Gay community under Nazism told through the eyes of Max (Clive Owen), a promiscuous habitu&eacute; of the boy bars who is arrested along with his boyfriend Rudy (Brian Webber) the morning after bringing home a member of the SA (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). On the way to Dachau Max is forced to beat Rudy to death by the brutal SS guards to prove his claim that he is not homosexual; Max has decided that a yellow star (Jewish) would be less dangerous a marker than a pink triangle. In the early scenes of the film we are given a look at the Berlin club scene; Mick Jagger has a stunning cameo as Greta, a performer at the club who knows what's coming and makes an abortive attempt to warn Max, but Max won't listen; neither will he listen to his uncle Freddie (Ian McKellen), an older and more discreet man who satisfies his desires in secret with rent boys. Freddie manages to get faked papers for Max but he will not leave without Rudy, and tragically, this decision spells doom ultimately for both of them. The second half of the story focuses on Max at Dachau; he is paired with another Gay prisoner, Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), and together they are made to move heavy stones from one pile to another and back again, and again, and again. Under the incredibly dehumanizing circumstances, these two men somehow manage to fall in love; and the result is one of the most remarkable and painful love stories ever put on film. Unfortunately, you have to wait nearly an hour to get to the story of Max and Horst, which is the segment of the film that has all the power and impact of Sherman's play. The first half, despite cutting out huge chunks of dialogue, seems interminable and lacks energy; one feels that had they kept the play's first half intact it would have taken about half an hour less to get to Dachau, which is where the beating heart of the story is located. The acting is wonderful, though. Clive Owen, brought in to fill Richard Gere's shoes (Gere had played the role on Broadway but was doing another film at the time), displays a haunting vulnerability as the terrified Max, and Lothaire Bluteau's Horst is in many ways the central figure of the piece, as he stands for what happens when love and hate collide. Bluteau bares his soul in probably the best performance in the picture, though he is in very good company. I give this one a 6 because what it does well, it does exceptionally well. It's a pity that the first half is so dull; the original was anything but.

    By coincidence, I was reading "Double Life: A Love Story from Broadway to Hollywood" at the same time that I saw this movie. It will undoubtedly seem a stretch to compare the lives of a well-off creative gay couple in America to a pair of homosexual inmates in the extraordinarily brutal circumstances of a Nazi concentration camp, but during the very well acted parts of the film where Clive Owen stood next to Lothaire Bluteau and they were able to "make love" without touching or doing anything obvious to anyone watching, it did seem remarkably similar to the life the American couple led for so many years. They too could never touch or show affection in public. In New York they lived separately and one had a marriage of convenience to a lesbian in order to survive professionally. Even after they eventually lived together and despite the fact that most people knew they were living together, for many social and business events they would never attend together and usually appeared with a woman "date." Even in Hollywood, of all places, for one of the men to get anywhere as a movie studio executive, any public evidence of their gay relationship had to be kept hidden awayÂ… and for that matter, most of the Jews in Hollywood during that time kept their Jewish identity hidden as well. What I saw in this movie was less to do with the Nazis specifically and more to do with the survival of emotional stability and of love in a hostile environment that refuses to accept that love can even exist.

And it wasn't just a matter of personal convenience. One was entrapped and arrested in a public toilet. The other was robbed and threatened with death by a pair of men whose main motivation was their loathing for "faggots." Blackmail overt and subtle existed throughout their lives. Yes, the movie was set in Nazi Germany, the epitome of all that's evil, but the message isn't meant simply as a historical reference. The freedom to be who you are and to love who you choose is still held hostage by the official and unofficial suppression of minorities, whether it's in places like Iran or Uganda or even in Middle America. Just because we aren't forced to wear striped uniforms or yellow/pink badges doesn't mean that we're free. The suicide rate amongst young gay people in America ought to be a call for change, but it's dismissed just as what happened to gays in Nazi Germany is ignored. You can choose to view this movie as a further indictment of the Nazis or you can see it as a much broader statement.

    I was an extra in this film, when I was 11 or 12 years old. I'm 24 now, but at the time I was a member of a local casting agency and me and another friend Lee found ourselves as part of the small group of children that had to paddle about in the water in the scene where the soldiers and prisoners march by. From what I recall it was a days worth of filming and I had to have my step cut out from my hair (it was the style back then!)but it was a really interesting experience. I remember the day being boiling hot but being treated really nicely by the production staff. It makes me laugh now at how blaze I was that this film starred the talents of Sir Ian McKellen and Clive Owen amongst others, but as an 11 year old I didn't know who they were! I was disappointed not to be credited at the end, that would have really proved to my friends that I have been in a film (albeit a very very small blink and you miss it moment!).

    No person who is knowledgeable about the Holocaust can ever claim that without seeing Bent. The play which opened in 1979 in London is about those all too forgotten victims of the Holocaust, the gay people of Europe. On Broadway the lead role that Clive Owen plays was essayed by Richard Gere for the run of 241 performances in the 1979-1980 season. Doing his original role from the London production as Uncle Freddie is Sir Ian McKellan. For those who think that homosexuality doesn't have an inherited element in it, Bent certainly gives lie to that. During the Weimar Republic years Germany had a thriving gay if somewhat discreet scene. After the Night of the Long Knives with the SA purge in 1934, gays were systematically rounded up for a final solution and Hitler certainly did a thorough job of it. Today the German Federal Republic has once again a thriving gay scene. Those recessive genes are popping out in full force. Bent does begin right at the Night of the Long Knives where Ernst Roehm was killed and anyone whoever knew of him and his not so discreet gay lifestyle was done in. The long knives of Himmler's SS come calling that night on Clive Owen and his boyfriend Brian Webber because they've picked up a pretty young man who used to trick with Roehm. He dies quite gruesomely, but they escape. Owen seeks aid from an old gay man who's called Uncle Freddie played by Ian McKellan who gives him some help, but whom Owen doesn't take some good advice from. McKellan has been very much deep in the closet, it's what's made him survive a society where homophobia is not just approved, but is now the law of the land. After this the scene cuts to a train to Dachau and Dachau itself where Owen and Webber are taken. Webber doesn't survive the trip, that scene is something I don't want to reveal. Owen decides that he'll take the Jewish star of David rather than a pink triangle, in the Dachau pecking order gay is worse than Jewish. Just as Schindler's List showed the dehumanization of Jews, Bent shows the dehumanization of gay people. Only there was no Oskar Schindler to save some of them. In fact sexuality as a form of repression has not ever been better displayed on screen than in Bent. But Owen learns about gay pride from another prisoner, Lothaire Bluteau who wears the pink triangle in defiance. They find a connection and consummate that connection in the only way they can do it under the circumstances. Again a scene I can't reveal. This film should not be missed by any Gay/Lesbian/Bi-Sexual/Trangendered person on this planet. It shows better than anything else what we potentially face in the way of repression when we are dehumanized by law and societal mores. We cannot let that happen and we have to make sure it's stopped in the places it does happen in the world. And this review is dedicated to all the brothers and sisters who died back then. Here's hope for a better world for our next generation.

    Nazi-era playboy Clive Owen (as Max) and his dancer lover Brian Webber (as Rudy) are pursued by Nazis, after Mr. Owen is picked up by blond hunk Nikolaj Waldau (as Wolf), in a gay club. After being captured, Owen and Mr. Weber are tortured, on a train to Germany's first concentration camp, at Dachau. Also on the train, Owen meets Lothaire Bluteau (as Horst). Mr. Bluteau wears the "Pink Triangle" identifying him as a homosexual, which is considered an especially low form of human life, by the Nazis. To avoid being beaten to death, Owen pretends to be Jewish, and is given the identifying "Yellow Star". At the concentration camp, prisoners Owen and Bluteau fall in love; but, they must avoid any physical contact. The opening club/orgy sequence is presented in a disjointed, confusing fashion. It's hard to figure out what is going on -- you should, if possible, play the opening (up until the Nazis bust into Owen's pad) twice. The cast is enhanced by cross-dressing Mick Jagger (as Greta), and the original 1979 stage production's "Max", Ian McKellen (as Uncle Freddie). Mr. Jagger also sings the haunting theme "Streets of Berlin". Director Sean Mathias and supporting actor Webber make excellent first impressions; it's strange to see so little work (film credits) immediately followed this production. This film version of Martin Sherman's "forbidden" love story is far from perfect; but, it's still quite captivating. The extent of "man's inhumanity to man" is, as always, horrifying. The film's non-physical sex scene, performed at the concentration camp, is extremely touching. ******* Bent (1997) Sean Mathias ~ Clive Owen, Lothaire Bluteau, Mick Jagger

    The movie is gorgeous! I think. I especially like the part the two guys stood there and make love to each without touching and looking at each other...touching your emotion actually...the desperate suicide committed by the man was unavoidable and sad...'yes, I love you; yes'...a confirmation of love is more than thousands of words...nice movie! 10 lines comments? wow, too critical for a good movie review...the Gettysburg address by Abraham Lincoln was short but convincible!powerful.The movie is gorgeous!

    "Bent" is an interesting little Holocaust-film curio (based on a stage production) that looks at the death camps from a homosexual perspective. It is intermittently affecting overall, but has its moments of pretension and self-indulgence (the baroque, decadent opening in Berlin comes to mind); the film can't really shake its stage roots, either, as reflected in certain scene setups (Ian McKellen's cameo in the park feels especially artificial). While conflicted over "Bent"'s seesaw of moments both powerful and superficial, I wound up liking it. Max (Clive Owen) is a member of Berlin's decadent gay underworld before World War II; when the Germans invade, he is promptly shipped off to a labor camp. Along the way, he meets Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), a fellow prisoner who's homosexual; as the duo stacks rocks in blazing summer and freezing winter, they strike up an unconventional love affair (standing still during a 3-minute break every 2 hours, they make love verbally (and literally); these scenes are greatly affecting, with Owen and Bluteau fully convincing us of their passion. Several years before he became a household name, Owen really proved his capabilities here. Though "Bent" treads to an achingly symbolic conclusion, the effort--for the most part--is worth seeing the whole way through.
