 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  After witnessing the murder of her first and only boyfriend, young Justice decides to forget about college and become a South Central Los Angeles hairdresser. Avoiding friends, the only way for her to cope with her depression is by composing beautiful poetry. On her way to a convention in Oakland, she is forced to ride with an independent-minded postal worker whom she has not gotten along with in the past. After various arguments between them and their friends, they start to discover that their thoughts on violence, socially and domestically, are the same. Justice may finally feel that she is not as alone as before.

    After making the effective tear-jerker Boyz N The Hood, John Singleton returns to the field of film with Poetic Justice. While this one is significantly different from that masterpiece, it still has its perks and a solid message to add to its formula of an urban-drama. It is the second film in what Singleton has branded his "Hood trilogy," but yet, it is definitely the weakest of them all. The plot: Justice (Jackson) is a young woman who lives in South Central, Los Angeles, and is still grieving over the loss of her boyfriend who was murdered during a silly confrontation. Justice writes numerous poems, and narrates them throughout the film. The actual poem were written by writer Maya Angelou, but the authenticity of the writing is the least of our concerns. Justice works as a hairstylist, and one day, a mailman named Lucky (Shakur) waltzes in one day trying to flirt with several women, when Justice and her friend play a mean joke on him. Karma has its way of reuniting the mailman and the stylist when Justice's friend Iesha (King) forces her to come along on a trip to Oakland with her boyfriend Chicago (Torry) and his coworker Lucky. Justice needs to go for a hair show, so reluctantly agrees to hitch a ride in Lucky's mail-truck. From then on, the film plays like a buddy road-trip film lacking the buddies. These characters must tolerate each other to survive the trip, but social and emotional conflicts continue to get in their way. Some of these situations feel genuine, but others feel contrived and meant to happen only so the film can advance. Poetic Justice is very distant from its predecessor, with the only similarities being the setting and the fact that Lucky's uncle, seen in the end of the film, looks a lot like Laurence Fishburne's character in Boyz N The Hood. I can't quite figure out why this one is inferior to them. Maybe it's because the characters aren't as well developed and dripping with charisma, maybe because each one of the characters can be bitter and selfish at points in the film struggling socially, or maybe it's just because. In Boyz N The Hood, Cuba Gooding Jr. was extremely developed to the point of almost going overboard. In Baby Boy, Omar Gooding was extremely developed. But in Poetic Justice, about a chunk of Janet Jackson's personality is almost snatched away. Same with the ending being a little perplexing and open for explanation. But this can all be overlooked by two things; the writing and the acting. John Singleton manages to squeeze the premise dry in terms of character dialog. It feels like real discussions being had by real human beings. And Tupac Shakur's acting talents are definitely the strongest point in the film. Poetic Justice has three meanings when I look at it. It describes redemption for one's previous actions, the character herself in the film, and what the slick writing achieves in this picture. Starring: Janet Jackson, Tupac Shakur, Regina King, Joe Torry, Tyra Ferrell. Directed by: John Singleton.

    the only reason i don't rate this film higher is because i always thought it was a tad long. john singleton, i love your work! like spike lee ( with a lot of his films) and ice cube (with 'friday' and 'barbershop') you've caught a time and place that's only clear to those that have lived it, or at least have knowledge of its existence. all of you capture black young'uns (east and west coasts) as they were lived during the times depicted in the films. wonderful stuff! great acting, solid story, everything is more heartfelt than not, it's why i go to the movies! i hope u and spike and ice cube and tyler perry (silly as he can b!) and the whole slew of other black filmmakers continue for many years to come. i love your work, your honesty and your sincerity. this is good movie-making, maya angelou's poetry is a plus and a bonus!!!

    I was hoping the main character, played by Janet Jackson, would lead to more adventures, like making a career out of her poetry composing, or befriend a nicer guy than Lucky (Tupac). After her boyfriend is killed at the beginning, Justice dives into despair and writes poems to escape her depression. She is dragged along for an anonymous ride with her friend and her boyfriend plus Lucky, which ends up in nothing but arguments and domestic violence. Why is Justice hanging out with these people? She could have made it big with her poetry and gotten out of South Central, get her dreams started and move on from her harsh life. Instead nothing really happens except that she and Lucky seem to share the same views on violent social life, which turns out to be boring. John Singleton seems to put in more bitchy, annoying domestic and social arguments between his characters in this film, Higher Learning, Baby Boy and this film unfortunately lack the deepness of his outstanding directional techniques he used for his first feature film, Boyz In Da Hood. 2fast 2furious and Four Brothers are taken out of the ghetto, but they don't share the rawness and desperation of Boyz. Shaft, on the other hand, is a change to the director's inventory and also shines a few "behind the camera" genius sparks he first showed us in his Oscar-nominated film Boyz In Da Hood.

    Pretentious. Unrealistic. Awful. Crap. I'm actually shocked this came from the writer of "Boyz in the Hood" & "Higher Learning." I had a hard time figuring out the plot of this one, on the surface level it was evident enough, but no, I thought there had to be more to it...It turns out I was wrong, all there is is the surface level. It doesn't stand as a romantic movie, it doesn't stand as a road trip movie, it doesn't stand as buddie movie. I'm actually depressed that Maya Angelou was in it,but I am comforted in the fact that she doesn't have to make a living as an actress. But it does strike a cord in me. I once dated an artist in university, I spent a lot of time with her and her friends, the film reminded me of them: shallow, pretentious, and totally awful.

    This is just the worst movie, it has no redeeming qualities for any characters. I watch it in parts out of sheer boredom. I hope Janet fulfilled her fantasy of being a hooch. The one bright spot is Tupac, I'm not that big of fan of his music or past lifestyle. But the young man could act for the most part. I'm really happy that John Singleton is either on hiatus or something, his films express everything that's ugly and embarrassing regarding some in our culture. Mr. Singleton, there are enough problems in our culture without you finding the worst.

    It's clear what Singleton attempted to do with this one, and I'd say it was a noble effort. Of course the script could've been tighter and the climax stronger and more rewarding, thus resulting in a more worthwhile film. However, in the film's defense, the charismatic Tupac shines while convincingly helming the sole well-conceived role. He's the best reason -- perhaps the only reason -- viewers should join in on the film's road trip to Oakland. He's subtle but confident, forceful but not heavy-handed, complex but genuine -- all the things that have also made him a legendary (and sorely missed) rapper. On the other hand, regarding Ms. Jackson... Well, I'll attempt to simply and kindly take the high road and say she probably shouldn't attempt to act again (unless she takes some drama classes). Janet simply doesn't get it. She doesn't understand the craft. She "acts" throughout the entire movie, something a skilled and experienced performer would never be caught doing. Perhaps Singleton was just too smitten with her to inform her that performing requires more than just emoting and script recitation. I understand that fans of Janet's music will invariably take issue with my comments, but if they'd simply separate her on-screen skills from her (heavily studio-enhanced) musical skills, I believe they'd have to agree with me. And it doesn't help that Janet's character (Justice) isn't a well-written, fully-developed and focused role; that's Singleton's fault -- not Janet's. Also, in the movie, fans of Maya Angelou will enjoy her cameo and the verses she wrote for Janet's character, a poet. And the fan(s) of Regina King will appreciate the challenging, range-revealing character stretch she takes on: she portrays a sassy, shallow, one-dimensional young lady with an attitude (that's something we've never seen her play before). Overall, Poetic Justice isn't one of Sigleton's finest moments, but again, revisiting Tupac's performance makes it entertaining and somewhat worthwhile.

    How can you read along in that tone and not feel like you are making fun of your own race of people. The time would arise when someone would need to get the people to do something to save themself and due to this mind tripping experiences it because a cause of grudge management. Testing because of a on screen Kiss and setting up a vicious murder on anyone only sways you all to another world of failing at your predestined goal. Make better sense and stop with the whining and finger pointing and all things could become fruitful for you and your generations down the line. The work is only good enough for you all to become more arrogant.

    I saw this film after becoming addicted to 'Boyz n the hood'and 'Higher learning', I think John Singleton is one of the greatest filmmakers working today and Poetic Justice is a great example of a truly dedicated and talented filmmaker. The story starts off with Justice (played brilliantly by Janet Jackson, what a surprise)who witnesses the slaying of her boyfriend at a movie, justice becomes very depressed with life and feels nothing but loneliness. She expresses this by writing poems in a notebook to reveal her pain for her lost love and for the pain of living in America's South central l.a district. Lucky (again played greatly by Tupac Shakur in i feel his most personal and greatest role from 'Juice' right up to 'Gang Related')is a postman with nothing to look forward for in his life except to look after his daughter and a dream of rapping his pain for the hood. Together they go on a road trip with two other friends and learn on how to live again and to find their way in life. The performances are great, Singletons direction is wonderful. If your a fan of other 'hood' movies than this you might find a little different from the others. But nonetheless a deep hearted gem. 9/10

    this movie was very uninteresting. The movie centers around four people traveling to South Central, LA on a postal mail carrier, come on! Maybe Janet thought Singleton had another "Boyz n DA Hood" in mind with this project "Poetic Justice", but after "Boyz n DA Hood" Singleton moved to less edgier movies to mundane movies like: 2 Fast 2 Furious, Baby Boy, and Shaft. Tupac and Janet give believable performances, but the plot is dull and dry. Seeing it once is definitely more than enough. Janet made the comment during the promotion of this movie, that she had a difficult time finding the right script before reading "Poetic Justice". She explained that most of the scripts she read were "too violent, too corny, too much profanity, too something... " She failed to realize that this movie was just too boring.

    I read the other review and simply had to comment on it. This was a great movie. Perhaps not filled with action. But it takes the poetic point of view and happily surprises you. It's in my DVD - shelf at home. Janet is showing a great acting and so is Tupac. My boyfriend weren't that crazy about it, so I've come to realize that it take a special kind of person to want to see and understand the movie at it's fullest. Since i write poetry in my spare time maybe that explains my passion about this movie. In all, I think you should rent it if the review at the back cover tempt you, it's pretty much what you get.

    After making the effective tear-jerker Boyz N The Hood, John Singleton returns to the field of film with Poetic Justice. While this one is significantly different from that masterpiece, it still has its perks and a solid message to add to its formula of an urban-drama. It is the second film in what Singleton has branded his "Hood trilogy," but yet, it is definitely the weakest of them all. The plot: Justice (Jackson) is a young woman who lives in South Central, Los Angeles, and is still grieving over the loss of her boyfriend who was murdered during a silly confrontation. Justice writes numerous poems, and narrates them throughout the film. The actual poem were written by writer Maya Angelou, but the authenticity of the writing is the least of our concerns. Justice works as a hairstylist, and one day, a mailman named Lucky (Shakur) waltzes in one day trying to flirt with several women, when Justice and her friend play a mean joke on him. Karma has its way of reuniting the mailman and the stylist when Justice's friend Iesha (King) forces her to come along on a trip to Oakland with her boyfriend Chicago (Torry) and his coworker Lucky. Justice needs to go for a hair show, so reluctantly agrees to hitch a ride in Lucky's mail-truck. From then on, the film plays like a buddy road-trip film lacking the buddies. These characters must tolerate each other to survive the trip, but social and emotional conflicts continue to get in their way. Some of these situations feel genuine, but others feel contrived and meant to happen only so the film can advance. Poetic Justice is very distant from its predecessor, with the only similarities being the setting and the fact that Lucky's uncle, seen in the end of the film, looks a lot like Laurence Fishburne's character in Boyz N The Hood. I can't quite figure out why this one is inferior to them. Maybe it's because the characters aren't as well developed and dripping with charisma, maybe because each one of the characters can be bitter and selfish at points in the film struggling socially, or maybe it's just because. In Boyz N The Hood, Cuba Gooding Jr. was extremely developed to the point of almost going overboard. In Baby Boy, Omar Gooding was extremely developed. But in Poetic Justice, about a chunk of Janet Jackson's personality is almost snatched away. Same with the ending being a little perplexing and open for explanation. But this can all be overlooked by two things; the writing and the acting. John Singleton manages to squeeze the premise dry in terms of character dialog. It feels like real discussions being had by real human beings. And Tupac Shakur's acting talents are definitely the strongest point in the film. Poetic Justice has three meanings when I look at it. It describes redemption for one's previous actions, the character herself in the film, and what the slick writing achieves in this picture. Starring: Janet Jackson, Tupac Shakur, Regina King, Joe Torry, Tyra Ferrell. Directed by: John Singleton.

    the only reason i don't rate this film higher is because i always thought it was a tad long. john singleton, i love your work! like spike lee ( with a lot of his films) and ice cube (with 'friday' and 'barbershop') you've caught a time and place that's only clear to those that have lived it, or at least have knowledge of its existence. all of you capture black young'uns (east and west coasts) as they were lived during the times depicted in the films. wonderful stuff! great acting, solid story, everything is more heartfelt than not, it's why i go to the movies! i hope u and spike and ice cube and tyler perry (silly as he can b!) and the whole slew of other black filmmakers continue for many years to come. i love your work, your honesty and your sincerity. this is good movie-making, maya angelou's poetry is a plus and a bonus!!!

    I was hoping the main character, played by Janet Jackson, would lead to more adventures, like making a career out of her poetry composing, or befriend a nicer guy than Lucky (Tupac). After her boyfriend is killed at the beginning, Justice dives into despair and writes poems to escape her depression. She is dragged along for an anonymous ride with her friend and her boyfriend plus Lucky, which ends up in nothing but arguments and domestic violence. Why is Justice hanging out with these people? She could have made it big with her poetry and gotten out of South Central, get her dreams started and move on from her harsh life. Instead nothing really happens except that she and Lucky seem to share the same views on violent social life, which turns out to be boring. John Singleton seems to put in more bitchy, annoying domestic and social arguments between his characters in this film, Higher Learning, Baby Boy and this film unfortunately lack the deepness of his outstanding directional techniques he used for his first feature film, Boyz In Da Hood. 2fast 2furious and Four Brothers are taken out of the ghetto, but they don't share the rawness and desperation of Boyz. Shaft, on the other hand, is a change to the director's inventory and also shines a few "behind the camera" genius sparks he first showed us in his Oscar-nominated film Boyz In Da Hood.

    Pretentious. Unrealistic. Awful. Crap. I'm actually shocked this came from the writer of "Boyz in the Hood" & "Higher Learning." I had a hard time figuring out the plot of this one, on the surface level it was evident enough, but no, I thought there had to be more to it...It turns out I was wrong, all there is is the surface level. It doesn't stand as a romantic movie, it doesn't stand as a road trip movie, it doesn't stand as buddie movie. I'm actually depressed that Maya Angelou was in it,but I am comforted in the fact that she doesn't have to make a living as an actress. But it does strike a cord in me. I once dated an artist in university, I spent a lot of time with her and her friends, the film reminded me of them: shallow, pretentious, and totally awful.

    This is just the worst movie, it has no redeeming qualities for any characters. I watch it in parts out of sheer boredom. I hope Janet fulfilled her fantasy of being a hooch. The one bright spot is Tupac, I'm not that big of fan of his music or past lifestyle. But the young man could act for the most part. I'm really happy that John Singleton is either on hiatus or something, his films express everything that's ugly and embarrassing regarding some in our culture. Mr. Singleton, there are enough problems in our culture without you finding the worst.

    It's clear what Singleton attempted to do with this one, and I'd say it was a noble effort. Of course the script could've been tighter and the climax stronger and more rewarding, thus resulting in a more worthwhile film. However, in the film's defense, the charismatic Tupac shines while convincingly helming the sole well-conceived role. He's the best reason -- perhaps the only reason -- viewers should join in on the film's road trip to Oakland. He's subtle but confident, forceful but not heavy-handed, complex but genuine -- all the things that have also made him a legendary (and sorely missed) rapper. On the other hand, regarding Ms. Jackson... Well, I'll attempt to simply and kindly take the high road and say she probably shouldn't attempt to act again (unless she takes some drama classes). Janet simply doesn't get it. She doesn't understand the craft. She "acts" throughout the entire movie, something a skilled and experienced performer would never be caught doing. Perhaps Singleton was just too smitten with her to inform her that performing requires more than just emoting and script recitation. I understand that fans of Janet's music will invariably take issue with my comments, but if they'd simply separate her on-screen skills from her (heavily studio-enhanced) musical skills, I believe they'd have to agree with me. And it doesn't help that Janet's character (Justice) isn't a well-written, fully-developed and focused role; that's Singleton's fault -- not Janet's. Also, in the movie, fans of Maya Angelou will enjoy her cameo and the verses she wrote for Janet's character, a poet. And the fan(s) of Regina King will appreciate the challenging, range-revealing character stretch she takes on: she portrays a sassy, shallow, one-dimensional young lady with an attitude (that's something we've never seen her play before). Overall, Poetic Justice isn't one of Sigleton's finest moments, but again, revisiting Tupac's performance makes it entertaining and somewhat worthwhile.

    How can you read along in that tone and not feel like you are making fun of your own race of people. The time would arise when someone would need to get the people to do something to save themself and due to this mind tripping experiences it because a cause of grudge management. Testing because of a on screen Kiss and setting up a vicious murder on anyone only sways you all to another world of failing at your predestined goal. Make better sense and stop with the whining and finger pointing and all things could become fruitful for you and your generations down the line. The work is only good enough for you all to become more arrogant.

    I saw this film after becoming addicted to 'Boyz n the hood'and 'Higher learning', I think John Singleton is one of the greatest filmmakers working today and Poetic Justice is a great example of a truly dedicated and talented filmmaker. The story starts off with Justice (played brilliantly by Janet Jackson, what a surprise)who witnesses the slaying of her boyfriend at a movie, justice becomes very depressed with life and feels nothing but loneliness. She expresses this by writing poems in a notebook to reveal her pain for her lost love and for the pain of living in America's South central l.a district. Lucky (again played greatly by Tupac Shakur in i feel his most personal and greatest role from 'Juice' right up to 'Gang Related')is a postman with nothing to look forward for in his life except to look after his daughter and a dream of rapping his pain for the hood. Together they go on a road trip with two other friends and learn on how to live again and to find their way in life. The performances are great, Singletons direction is wonderful. If your a fan of other 'hood' movies than this you might find a little different from the others. But nonetheless a deep hearted gem. 9/10

    this movie was very uninteresting. The movie centers around four people traveling to South Central, LA on a postal mail carrier, come on! Maybe Janet thought Singleton had another "Boyz n DA Hood" in mind with this project "Poetic Justice", but after "Boyz n DA Hood" Singleton moved to less edgier movies to mundane movies like: 2 Fast 2 Furious, Baby Boy, and Shaft. Tupac and Janet give believable performances, but the plot is dull and dry. Seeing it once is definitely more than enough. Janet made the comment during the promotion of this movie, that she had a difficult time finding the right script before reading "Poetic Justice". She explained that most of the scripts she read were "too violent, too corny, too much profanity, too something... " She failed to realize that this movie was just too boring.

    I read the other review and simply had to comment on it. This was a great movie. Perhaps not filled with action. But it takes the poetic point of view and happily surprises you. It's in my DVD - shelf at home. Janet is showing a great acting and so is Tupac. My boyfriend weren't that crazy about it, so I've come to realize that it take a special kind of person to want to see and understand the movie at it's fullest. Since i write poetry in my spare time maybe that explains my passion about this movie. In all, I think you should rent it if the review at the back cover tempt you, it's pretty much what you get.
