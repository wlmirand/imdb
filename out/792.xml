 <sinopse>
  In 1920s New York, a struggling playwright is forced to cast a mobster's talentless girlfriend in his latest drama in order to get it produced.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Set in 1920's New York City, this movie tells the story of idealistic young playwright David Shayne. Producer Julian Marx finally finds funding for the project from gangster Nick Valenti. The catch is that Nick's girl friend Olive Neal gets the part of a psychiatrist, and Olive is a bimbo who could never pass for a psychiatrist as well as being a dreadful actress. Agreeing to this first compromise is the first step to Broadway's complete seduction of David, who neglects longtime girl friend Ellen. Meanwhile David puts up with Warner Purcell, the leading man who is a compulsive eater, Helen Sinclair, the grand dame who wants her part jazzed up, and Cheech, Olive's interfering hitman / bodyguard. Eventually, the playwright must decide whether art or life is more important.

    "Bullets Over Broadway" doesn't work for the same reason other Woody Allen comedies he's written but not starred in don't work. It's very simple, having someone else playing a character that has all the Woody insecurities and mannerisms leaves one wishing for Allen to be playing the part, and feeling cheated that he isn't in the film. Such is the case with John Cusack's playwright character. What you get is a Woody Allen clone that simply can't deliver the comedy intended by Allen. The cast is game, but fine comedians Jennifer Tilly, Jack Warden, and Rob Reiner, don't deliver enough chuckles to overcome the lack of Woody Allen playing the part he obviously was meant to play. - MERK

    Never underestimate Woody Allen's capability to surprise you. The first act "Bullets Over Broadway" didn't put my expectations very high, until an expected little twist in the middle transformed everything and contributed to one of Woody Allen's most fascinating secondary characters. The film opens in the 1928 Broadway, with one cinematic archetype following another. John Cusack is David Shayne, a young playwright. Convinced of his artistic genius, he's your typical struggling newcomer trying to impose his unique style. Not a revolutionary character, Cusack almost replays some mimics of Allen's neurotic writer, only differing physically, with his tall frame canceled by his constantly hunched demeanor, he's handsome enough to make his sex-appeal believable. Although with such a title as "God of Our Fathers", the line between the very talent he claims to have and a sort of pompous pseudo-intellectual vibe is very thin, but we give him the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, Shayne's manager, played by Jack Warden, finds a generous heart accepting to finance the play. Not your typical patron of art, the man is Valenti, a mobster played by the irreplaceable Joe Viterelli. Theater is not his cup of tea but who cares, he's absolutely in love with Olive, his girlfriend, a dancer as ambitious as she's talentless. With her nasal voice, voluptuous forms and misplaced self-satisfaction, Jennifer Tilly revives the performance of Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont in "Singin' in the Rain", with I don't think that was even possible- a much more horrible voice. And no one can even say a word against her, all through the rehearsals, she's chaperoned by a bodyguard named Cheech, one of Viterelli's button-man, more at ease with playing craps and disposing of some bodies, than enduring Shayne's intellectual junk. To go on and on with archetypes, Shayne lives with Ellen, his caring girlfriend, played by Mary Louise Parker, but she lacks the flamboyance and charisma of her soon-to-be rival, Helen Sinclair. Sinclair is the obligatory diva, who played so much plays, worked with so many writers (always the best) that all her characters spill over her mannerisms. If Jennifer Tilly is a dead-on Lina Lamont, Dianne Weist Sinclar is a perfect Norma Desmond, an actress so wrapped up in her ego, she oozes a natural commanding presence, when she orders Shayne 'Don't speak' with a voice as low as possible, he knows it's an act, but still, he has no choice but obeying. Both Tilly and Wiest's performance earned them two deserved Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Wiest won). But had the film only relied on these performances and the great roles of Jim Broadbent and Tracey Ullman, the result would have been a charming little comedy, with no impact whatsoever. To give you an idea, there's a moment when Shayne has a drink with Sinclair, she orders two martinis, in fact the two martinis were for her. The gag is cleverly written, it's funny, but coming from Woody Allen, it didn't have that extra little spice I expected, granted the film is magnificently directed, with costumes and art-directing revisiting the roaring twenties with exuberance, there was not much to hook our hearts on. But then, in the middle of one rehearsal, when the actors and Shayne have an argument about the script, Cheech intervenes. The thug who exuded intimidation and street-smart force, suggests a little revision to the play, and guess what, it works. I knew Chazz Palminteri was Oscar-nominated for this role, I thought he would play in the stage, I thought everything except the fact that he would reveal the genius Shayne obviously lacks. Then the movie took off and turned into a clever and insightful commentary about the meaning of being an artist, creating an oeuvre and being so passionate about it that you wouldn't let anything undermine it, anyone interfere with it. It's about the conflict tormenting a man who tries to be an artist, only to be confronted to another who's genuinely an artist, much more a genius. The romantic subplot involving Shayne and Sinclair takes a whole new importance to the story. When Shayne discusses with his friend Sheldon (Rob Reiner) about it, Sheldon makes one of the most unforgettable statement from any Woody Allen's film: "an artist creates his own moral universe". It seems like an alibi to justify the craziest actions committed by an artist, in fact, it echoes the very actions committed by Cheech, out of love and passion for his work, that will push to the extreme the notion of "moral universe". The brilliance of the script is that Cheech' actions illustrate both what he is and what Shayne is not. And again, Woody Allen is able to transcend usual movie archetypes and illustrate through them the deepest torments invading the heart of artists and wannabe artists. Woody Allen shows the gap between those who got the talent, and those who don't, and he's so talented that he's even able to create a great character who realizes that he doesn't have the talent. The ending of "Bullets Over Broadway" is not the apotheosis we expected, but it's not a downer either. Shayne is finally able to realize what counts for him and what doesn't, it's about knowing oneself and acting in consequence. It's about responsibility, and the level of maturity expressed in the ending is so unexpected it does highlight the hidden genius of the script. And as nothing is gratuitous in a great script, first, its greatness relies on a fascinating contradiction, and I'll never forget the thug with writing genius played by Chazz Palminteri. And even a cute inoffensive gag like Olive not remembering what came after Hamlet's "To be" is a subtle reference to the main conflict of the film. To be an artist or not to be an artist,  to be or not to be, and "Bullets Over Broadway" provides some of the smartest answers to that eternal question.

    Woody Allen successfully combines gangsters and Broadway theater in this riveting comedy that earned seven Academy Award nominations. John Cusack stars in the leading role, doing his best Woody Allen impression of course, as David Shayne, a playwright who has to cast a mobster's girlfriend in one of the starring roles. She is given a body guard named Cheech, played by Chazz Polminteri, who has to sit back and keep an eye on her during rehearsals. As the show starts to come together Cheech has some ideas of his own about the show, and they end up making it a better play than the one David originally wrote. This comedic turn of events fuels the rest of this lively and genuinely funny film. Bullets Over Broadway is simply more of Woody Allen doing what Woody Allen does best. It's quick, witty, whimsical, and intelligently hilarious. It's a great story full of wildly eccentric characters played by an ensemble of great actors. It possesses that engaging Woody Allen cadence full of all the Woody Allen quirkiness that makes us love watching his films. Bullets Over Broadway has a lot of charm and delivers a lot of laughs. There's nothing revolutionary here, but Bullets Over Broadway shows us a great time with all its witticism and frivolous ingenuity. Woody Allen is a pure genius, and he always seems to know exactly what he is doing when he makes a film. His specialty is quirky comedy, so it's no surprise that Bullets Over Broadway is just a great film. The story is simple yet effectively hysterical, and the characters are brilliantly constructed and wonderfully written, each displaying their own quirky uniqueness that becomes part of clever quirky whole. This is a great film, and one that continues to show what a brilliant man Woody Allen is.

    As Woody Allen's MIDNIGHT IN Paris (2011, a 6/10) doesn't impress me much and his latest Italian carol TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) gets horrifying feedbacks, so I fumble around his earlier oeuvre, thanks to his prolific filmography, thus comes BULLETS OVER Broadway (a 7 Oscar nomination receiver in 1994) courtesy of one simple criterion, more often than not, films in which Woody is not starred are much better than in which he is both the director/writer and the actor. I have only watched a handful of Woody's films, but BULLETS OVER Broadway could easily sit in the top row of any years-best list (for me, it just misses my top 10 film in 1994, which is an ultra-competitive year for films, but Cusack, Wiest, Tilly and Palminteri all crack into my top 10 acting rankings). Wiest and Tilly, obtained two Oscar nominations and Wiest was the final winner, who is divinely lofty and my pick as well, she is simply amazing in her delivering of the repetitive "don't speak" lines and the voice warm-up scenes before the final premier. Meanwhile Tilly is plainly acting herself (being slightly amusing and largely annoying), this is an exact example of the disparagement between a bona fide actress and an one-off sensation (Palminteri's Oscar nomination may also belong to be the latter unfortunately), notwithstanding the fact that most acting laborers will never even procure such an opportunity, for instance John Cusack, who is playing Woody Allen in the film and is reliably superb but regrettably snubbed again (after THE GRIFTERS 1990, a 7/10). Speaking of the film, the script has Woody's distinctive bourgeoisie and artist self-mockery in it and the genre mash-up of gangster comedy and a Broadway playwright trapped in his writer's block works adroitly well, although the shooting shots are not Woody's strong suit and the diamond-in-the-rough deployment is over-simplified (maybe there is just no reason beyond it). But on the whole, the witty conversations will always strike a chord if you are an ordinary man with a highbrow heart, and in the final analysis, Diane Wiest alone is worth the time.

Its humorous cinema at its finest hour! 'Bullets Over Broadway' Synopsis: In 1920s New York, a struggling playwright is forced to cast a mobster's talentless girlfriend in his latest drama in order to get it produced. 'Bullets Over Broadway' is a delicious comedy, that's magnificently written by Allen & Douglas McGrath. The characters, the entire set-up is so interesting & funny, that there is hardly a moment when the film falters. Allen's Direction is sharp! Cinematography by Carlo DiPalma is excellent. Editing is good. Performance-Wise: Dianne Wiest won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress & she deserved too. She delivers a career best performance. John Cusack is fantastic. Seriously, why is he so under-rated? Jennifer Tilly is marvelous, while Chazz Palminteri takes an unforgettable turn. Jack Warden is always terrific. Mary-Louise Parker leaves a mark. Tracey Ullman & Jim Broadbent are outstanding. On the whole, 'Bullets Over Broadway' is a must see.

    Woody at his best. A movie about artists - not only about writers ( but mostly about them ), but about any artist, who is trapped between his talent and the expectations that other people have about him. A movie about what it takes to make something perfect. I strongly consider John Cusack's ( David ) character and Chazz Palminteri's ( Cheech ) character as different sides of the same person - the bohemian, who sees in art just an excuse for meeting famous people and living like them and the real artist, for whom art and creating are only reasons to live. And the moral? I guess no one can say it better than David's girlfriend - one could not love an artist if he hasn't got enough dignity to be a man in the first place.

    Because they would take advantage of you with such positive remark. Artists and criminals and their little and complex worlds of being powerful gods, creatures who can create and destroy at the same time. The power of the criminals, gangsters in this case, are the use of his weapons against their enemies or whoever appears on their way; artists like the play writer/director in this film has the power of creativity, words are carefully chosen, scenes and dialogs are marvelously written in order to make the most fantastic creation of all, and the writer has the final word on everything. Well, almost everything. John Cusack's character is a down-on-luck author who finally gets the chance of developing his play in the way he wants, at first by resurrecting the career of diva Helen Sinclair (Dianne Wiest) and selecting his favorite actors. But his luck ends when the play's financier, a mobster (Joe Viterelli) gives the ultimate that his girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly) must have a part on the show, but she has never acted before. The guy gets toyed by this goofy and demanding new actress, by her tough bodyguard (Chazz Palminteri) who'll try to change the play's script, always bothered by the "irrealism" of it; and at last the less negative interference of Sinclair, of whom he madly falls in love with. As the movie progresses we keep asking ourselves: "There's a real chance of this play ever become a hit?" and "How does this writer will ever make his way through fame with such interferences?". While the work of his life gets deconstructed in a turbulence of confusion we keep laughing at all of his drama, or at the other characters eccentric ways of doing things. Outrageously comical "Bullets Over Broadway" is Woody Allen's sound and fury on the power of artistic creations and how they happen, and the way they're developed, constantly changing from what they used to be. Here's a treasure to be admired; it leaves you in a complete state of amazement, a powerful ecstasy. Hilarious situations are wonderfully created, not a single moment is wasted or let down, everything is a feast for our senses from the magnificent casting to the art direction, costumes and cinematography. Allen at his greatest, so enjoy the spectacle! 10/10

    A film so criminally overrated and staggeringly unfunny as to defy description. Allen takes a very promising concept and somehow manages to craft a film that is devoid of hilarity. Idealistic playwright John Cusack finds the backing to mount his play from a gangster. The catch is that in return the gangster's bimbo mistress Jennifer Tilly is to be cast as a psychiatrist in the play. Henchman Chazz Palminteri is dispatched to babysit Tilly and coach her in acting, but in the process makes suggestions to Cusack's play that dramatically improve its quality. This should be hilarious - yet it is not. I don't think I cracked a smile once during the entire course of the film. I have begun to believe that it is utterly impossible for Allen to write genuinely likable or appealing characters - even within the constraints of a broad fable such as this one. Nearly everyone we see on screen is selfish, obnoxious and nasty. Too many scenes are directed as though by chaos. For instance, I lost count of how many scenes start or ended with a group of characters stationed at different points of the set and shrieking their lines at each other, often at the same time, so that the scene is reduced to a wall of incoherent noise. While Allen thankfully delivers us from taking on the leading man duties again, Cusack is simply too bland and uninteresting to hold attention or anchor the action. Tracey Ullman, Mary-Louise Parker and Jim Broadbent are wasted in underwritten roles. Dianne Wiest gets to ham it up as a legendary Broadway diva brought in to headline the show. While she throws herself body and soul into the part, her lampoon of the haughty dowager becomes repetitive. This is a fault of the screenplay more than the actress. She is playing a caricature and one that we have seen done better and funnier in other films. The first time she strikes a pose like Greta Garbo and admonishes Cusack "Don't speak!" is barely amusing. By the umpteenth time she has done this throughout the film, it has ceased to have any comedic impact at all. Apparently the majority of the comedy is supposed to come from the interactions between Palminteri's flustered gun man and Tilly's bimbo. Unfortunately, their scenes are incredibly unpleasant. Palminteri is stuck playing a stereotypical goombah (with the twist that he writes better than Cusack) and Tilly is the quintessential floozy. Both of them hate each - and I mean they really hate each other. Their line readings are loud and shrill and generate all of the charm of a legion of car alarms going off at the same time. There is almost a collective sigh of relief when their scenes conclude and their dialog pretty much goes along the lines of "Why don't you shut up!", "No, you shut up!", "You shut up!", and "You shut up yourself!" Oh, the hilarity. It must have taken Allen all of five minutes to fabricate this winning dialog. By the time the film itself rolls to its unsurprising conclusion, one realizes that you don't care about any of these characters and you want back the time that Allen and his minions have stolen from your life. A real endurance test akin to dental surgery without benefit of Novacaine.

    Another wonderful Woody Allen comedy, this film is all about playwright David Shayne (John Cusack) and just how far he will compromise his artistic integrity to get himself and his play talked about in all the right circles by all the right people. This leads to him allowing a gangster's moll (Jennifer Tilly) to play a main part, becoming smitten with an ageing starlet (the wonderful Dianne Wiest, never in better comic form), being helped in rewrites by the man (Chazz Palminteri) chosen to look after the gangster's moll and generally dealing with a number of strange people who need careful attention paid to their egos (Tracey Ullman and Jim Broadbent being the other main pair). Written (with Douglas McGrath) and directed by Allen, as usual, this movie may not be the most intelligent or most philosophical in the New Yorker's illustrious career but it deftly blends a lot of genuine fun and laugh out loud moments with some minor musing on just what the artist needs in his life to fill his heart. Fleeting acceptance or genuine love? All of the performances are splendid (with the top marks going to Tilly, Broadbent and Wiest) and while some may feel that the characters are rather broadly played for easy laughs I tend to think that each one gets just enough time on screen to be more than just a one-joke caricature. But I would say that, simply due to the fact that I could watch Dianne Wiest saying "don't speak" on a constant loop (just watch the movie and you'll know what I mean). Warm, witty and full of great actors, I rank this as one of my favourite Woody Allen movies and hope others love it too.

    Woody Allen will always be remembered as a director who could create situations in which characters talk frequently and superbly. In this film, he puts together his spin on life and conversation with the setting of the 1920s Broadway background to create a memorable and sweet film about a group of people that we become so enamored with that they turn out to be more than characters; they become human beings on screen. A terrific cast bolsters this already fine story as we witness a young, idealistic writer/director of the stage (John Cusack) attempt to have his play unscathed by the actors. He soon casts a great Margo Channing-type legend (Dianne Weist), a wacky side-lady (Tracy Ullman), a great actor with an eating fetish and a mobster's girlfriend attempting to break into acting but doesn't quite have the chops. The key to the whole story is the character of the mobster's hit-man, played by Chazz Palmenteri who turns out to be the most theatrically sophisticated and wise of all the characters. Here, Allen shows that genius can come from the most unlikely of sources and also uses it to bring out a number of great comical scenes as well. I guess the best thing to say about this movie is how wonderful Woody Allen's writing is. By this time, he has gotten down the pacing and rhythm so perfectly that it truly is an art-form for him to write screenplays. And, as always in a Woody Allen movie, the actors are terrific and have great fun by playing the parts with gusto and joy. This is a much lighter effort than say, Husbands and Wives or Crimes and Misdemeanors, but it stays in the tradition of Allen able to mix together great dialogue, unique characters and a story that unfolds so easily and delightfully. A treasure unlike any other, Woody Allen creates a fun film one right after the other.

And as nothing is gratuitous in a great script, first, its greatness relies on a fascinating contradiction, and I'll never forget the thug with writing genius played by Chazz Palminteri. And even a cute inoffensive gag like Olive not remembering what came after Hamlet's "To be" is a subtle reference to the main conflict of the film. To be an artist or not to be an artist,  to be or not to be, and "Bullets Over Broadway" provides some of the smartest answers to that eternal question.

    Woody Allen successfully combines gangsters and Broadway theater in this riveting comedy that earned seven Academy Award nominations. John Cusack stars in the leading role, doing his best Woody Allen impression of course, as David Shayne, a playwright who has to cast a mobster's girlfriend in one of the starring roles. She is given a body guard named Cheech, played by Chazz Polminteri, who has to sit back and keep an eye on her during rehearsals. As the show starts to come together Cheech has some ideas of his own about the show, and they end up making it a better play than the one David originally wrote. This comedic turn of events fuels the rest of this lively and genuinely funny film. Bullets Over Broadway is simply more of Woody Allen doing what Woody Allen does best. It's quick, witty, whimsical, and intelligently hilarious. It's a great story full of wildly eccentric characters played by an ensemble of great actors. It possesses that engaging Woody Allen cadence full of all the Woody Allen quirkiness that makes us love watching his films. Bullets Over Broadway has a lot of charm and delivers a lot of laughs. There's nothing revolutionary here, but Bullets Over Broadway shows us a great time with all its witticism and frivolous ingenuity. Woody Allen is a pure genius, and he always seems to know exactly what he is doing when he makes a film. His specialty is quirky comedy, so it's no surprise that Bullets Over Broadway is just a great film. The story is simple yet effectively hysterical, and the characters are brilliantly constructed and wonderfully written, each displaying their own quirky uniqueness that becomes part of clever quirky whole. This is a great film, and one that continues to show what a brilliant man Woody Allen is.

    As Woody Allen's MIDNIGHT IN Paris (2011, a 6/10) doesn't impress me much and his latest Italian carol TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) gets horrifying feedbacks, so I fumble around his earlier oeuvre, thanks to his prolific filmography, thus comes BULLETS OVER Broadway (a 7 Oscar nomination receiver in 1994) courtesy of one simple criterion, more often than not, films in which Woody is not starred are much better than in which he is both the director/writer and the actor. I have only watched a handful of Woody's films, but BULLETS OVER Broadway could easily sit in the top row of any years-best list (for me, it just misses my top 10 film in 1994, which is an ultra-competitive year for films, but Cusack, Wiest, Tilly and Palminteri all crack into my top 10 acting rankings). Wiest and Tilly, obtained two Oscar nominations and Wiest was the final winner, who is divinely lofty and my pick as well, she is simply amazing in her delivering of the repetitive "don't speak" lines and the voice warm-up scenes before the final premier. Meanwhile Tilly is plainly acting herself (being slightly amusing and largely annoying), this is an exact example of the disparagement between a bona fide actress and an one-off sensation (Palminteri's Oscar nomination may also belong to be the latter unfortunately), notwithstanding the fact that most acting laborers will never even procure such an opportunity, for instance John Cusack, who is playing Woody Allen in the film and is reliably superb but regrettably snubbed again (after THE GRIFTERS 1990, a 7/10). Speaking of the film, the script has Woody's distinctive bourgeoisie and artist self-mockery in it and the genre mash-up of gangster comedy and a Broadway playwright trapped in his writer's block works adroitly well, although the shooting shots are not Woody's strong suit and the diamond-in-the-rough deployment is over-simplified (maybe there is just no reason beyond it). But on the whole, the witty conversations will always strike a chord if you are an ordinary man with a highbrow heart, and in the final analysis, Diane Wiest alone is worth the time.

Its humorous cinema at its finest hour! 'Bullets Over Broadway' Synopsis: In 1920s New York, a struggling playwright is forced to cast a mobster's talentless girlfriend in his latest drama in order to get it produced. 'Bullets Over Broadway' is a delicious comedy, that's magnificently written by Allen & Douglas McGrath.

    Woody at his best. A movie about artists - not only about writers ( but mostly about them ), but about any artist, who is trapped between his talent and the expectations that other people have about him. A movie about what it takes to make something perfect. I strongly consider John Cusack's ( David ) character and Chazz Palminteri's ( Cheech ) character as different sides of the same person - the bohemian, who sees in art just an excuse for meeting famous people and living like them and the real artist, for whom art and creating are only reasons to live. And the moral? I guess no one can say it better than David's girlfriend - one could not love an artist if he hasn't got enough dignity to be a man in the first place.

    Because they would take advantage of you with such positive remark. Artists and criminals and their little and complex worlds of being powerful gods, creatures who can create and destroy at the same time. The power of the criminals, gangsters in this case, are the use of his weapons against their enemies or whoever appears on their way; artists like the play writer/director in this film has the power of creativity, words are carefully chosen, scenes and dialogs are marvelously written in order to make the most fantastic creation of all, and the writer has the final word on everything. Well, almost everything. John Cusack's character is a down-on-luck author who finally gets the chance of developing his play in the way he wants, at first by resurrecting the career of diva Helen Sinclair (Dianne Wiest) and selecting his favorite actors. But his luck ends when the play's financier, a mobster (Joe Viterelli) gives the ultimate that his girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly) must have a part on the show, but she has never acted before. The guy gets toyed by this goofy and demanding new actress, by her tough bodyguard (Chazz Palminteri) who'll try to change the play's script, always bothered by the "irrealism" of it; and at last the less negative interference of Sinclair, of whom he madly falls in love with. As the movie progresses we keep asking ourselves: "There's a real chance of this play ever become a hit?" and "How does this writer will ever make his way through fame with such interferences?". While the work of his life gets deconstructed in a turbulence of confusion we keep laughing at all of his drama, or at the other characters eccentric ways of doing things. Outrageously comical "Bullets Over Broadway" is Woody Allen's sound and fury on the power of artistic creations and how they happen, and the way they're developed, constantly changing from what they used to be. Here's a treasure to be admired; it leaves you in a complete state of amazement, a powerful ecstasy. Hilarious situations are wonderfully created, not a single moment is wasted or let down, everything is a feast for our senses from the magnificent casting to the art direction, costumes and cinematography. Allen at his greatest, so enjoy the spectacle! 10/10

    A film so criminally overrated and staggeringly unfunny as to defy description. Allen takes a very promising concept and somehow manages to craft a film that is devoid of hilarity. Idealistic playwright John Cusack finds the backing to mount his play from a gangster. The catch is that in return the gangster's bimbo mistress Jennifer Tilly is to be cast as a psychiatrist in the play. Henchman Chazz Palminteri is dispatched to babysit Tilly and coach her in acting, but in the process makes suggestions to Cusack's play that dramatically improve its quality. This should be hilarious - yet it is not. I don't think I cracked a smile once during the entire course of the film. I have begun to believe that it is utterly impossible for Allen to write genuinely likable or appealing characters - even within the constraints of a broad fable such as this one. Nearly everyone we see on screen is selfish, obnoxious and nasty. Too many scenes are directed as though by chaos. For instance, I lost count of how many scenes start or ended with a group of characters stationed at different points of the set and shrieking their lines at each other, often at the same time, so that the scene is reduced to a wall of incoherent noise. While Allen thankfully delivers us from taking on the leading man duties again, Cusack is simply too bland and uninteresting to hold attention or anchor the action. Tracey Ullman, Mary-Louise Parker and Jim Broadbent are wasted in underwritten roles. Dianne Wiest gets to ham it up as a legendary Broadway diva brought in to headline the show. While she throws herself body and soul into the part, her lampoon of the haughty dowager becomes repetitive. This is a fault of the screenplay more than the actress. She is playing a caricature and one that we have seen done better and funnier in other films. The first time she strikes a pose like Greta Garbo and admonishes Cusack "Don't speak!" is barely amusing. By the umpteenth time she has done this throughout the film, it has ceased to have any comedic impact at all. Apparently the majority of the comedy is supposed to come from the interactions between Palminteri's flustered gun man and Tilly's bimbo. Unfortunately, their scenes are incredibly unpleasant. Palminteri is stuck playing a stereotypical goombah (with the twist that he writes better than Cusack) and Tilly is the quintessential floozy. Both of them hate each - and I mean they really hate each other. Their line readings are loud and shrill and generate all of the charm of a legion of car alarms going off at the same time. There is almost a collective sigh of relief when their scenes conclude and their dialog pretty much goes along the lines of "Why don't you shut up!", "No, you shut up!", "You shut up!", and "You shut up yourself!" Oh, the hilarity. It must have taken Allen all of five minutes to fabricate this winning dialog. By the time the film itself rolls to its unsurprising conclusion, one realizes that you don't care about any of these characters and you want back the time that Allen and his minions have stolen from your life. A real endurance test akin to dental surgery without benefit of Novacaine.

    Another wonderful Woody Allen comedy, this film is all about playwright David Shayne (John Cusack) and just how far he will compromise his artistic integrity to get himself and his play talked about in all the right circles by all the right people. This leads to him allowing a gangster's moll (Jennifer Tilly) to play a main part, becoming smitten with an ageing starlet (the wonderful Dianne Wiest, never in better comic form), being helped in rewrites by the man (Chazz Palminteri) chosen to look after the gangster's moll and generally dealing with a number of strange people who need careful attention paid to their egos (Tracey Ullman and Jim Broadbent being the other main pair). Written (with Douglas McGrath) and directed by Allen, as usual, this movie may not be the most intelligent or most philosophical in the New Yorker's illustrious career but it deftly blends a lot of genuine fun and laugh out loud moments with some minor musing on just what the artist needs in his life to fill his heart. Fleeting acceptance or genuine love? All of the performances are splendid (with the top marks going to Tilly, Broadbent and Wiest) and while some may feel that the characters are rather broadly played for easy laughs I tend to think that each one gets just enough time on screen to be more than just a one-joke caricature. But I would say that, simply due to the fact that I could watch Dianne Wiest saying "don't speak" on a constant loop (just watch the movie and you'll know what I mean). Warm, witty and full of great actors, I rank this as one of my favourite Woody Allen movies and hope others love it too.

    Woody Allen will always be remembered as a director who could create situations in which characters talk frequently and superbly. In this film, he puts together his spin on life and conversation with the setting of the 1920s Broadway background to create a memorable and sweet film about a group of people that we become so enamored with that they turn out to be more than characters; they become human beings on screen. A terrific cast bolsters this already fine story as we witness a young, idealistic writer/director of the stage (John Cusack) attempt to have his play unscathed by the actors. He soon casts a great Margo Channing-type legend (Dianne Weist), a wacky side-lady (Tracy Ullman), a great actor with an eating fetish and a mobster's girlfriend attempting to break into acting but doesn't quite have the chops. The key to the whole story is the character of the mobster's hit-man, played by Chazz Palmenteri who turns out to be the most theatrically sophisticated and wise of all the characters. Here, Allen shows that genius can come from the most unlikely of sources and also uses it to bring out a number of great comical scenes as well. I guess the best thing to say about this movie is how wonderful Woody Allen's writing is. By this time, he has gotten down the pacing and rhythm so perfectly that it truly is an art-form for him to write screenplays. And, as always in a Woody Allen movie, the actors are terrific and have great fun by playing the parts with gusto and joy. This is a much lighter effort than say, Husbands and Wives or Crimes and Misdemeanors, but it stays in the tradition of Allen able to mix together great dialogue, unique characters and a story that unfolds so easily and delightfully. A treasure unlike any other, Woody Allen creates a fun film one right after the other.

    "Bullets Over Broadway" doesn't work for the same reason other Woody Allen comedies he's written but not starred in don't work. It's very simple, having someone else playing a character that has all the Woody insecurities and mannerisms leaves one wishing for Allen to be playing the part, and feeling cheated that he isn't in the film. Such is the case with John Cusack's playwright character. What you get is a Woody Allen clone that simply can't deliver the comedy intended by Allen. The cast is game, but fine comedians Jennifer Tilly, Jack Warden, and Rob Reiner, don't deliver enough chuckles to overcome the lack of Woody Allen playing the part he obviously was meant to play. - MERK

    Never underestimate Woody Allen's capability to surprise you. The first act "Bullets Over Broadway" didn't put my expectations very high, until an expected little twist in the middle transformed everything and contributed to one of Woody Allen's most fascinating secondary characters. The film opens in the 1928 Broadway, with one cinematic archetype following another. John Cusack is David Shayne, a young playwright. Convinced of his artistic genius, he's your typical struggling newcomer trying to impose his unique style. Not a revolutionary character, Cusack almost replays some mimics of Allen's neurotic writer, only differing physically, with his tall frame canceled by his constantly hunched demeanor, he's handsome enough to make his sex-appeal believable. Although with such a title as "God of Our Fathers", the line between the very talent he claims to have and a sort of pompous pseudo-intellectual vibe is very thin, but we give him the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, Shayne's manager, played by Jack Warden, finds a generous heart accepting to finance the play. Not your typical patron of art, the man is Valenti, a mobster played by the irreplaceable Joe Viterelli. Theater is not his cup of tea but who cares, he's absolutely in love with Olive, his girlfriend, a dancer as ambitious as she's talentless. With her nasal voice, voluptuous forms and misplaced self-satisfaction, Jennifer Tilly revives the performance of Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont in "Singin' in the Rain", with I don't think that was even possible- a much more horrible voice. And no one can even say a word against her, all through the rehearsals, she's chaperoned by a bodyguard named Cheech, one of Viterelli's button-man, more at ease with playing craps and disposing of some bodies, than enduring Shayne's intellectual junk. To go on and on with archetypes, Shayne lives with Ellen, his caring girlfriend, played by Mary Louise Parker, but she lacks the flamboyance and charisma of her soon-to-be rival, Helen Sinclair. Sinclair is the obligatory diva, who played so much plays, worked with so many writers (always the best) that all her characters spill over her mannerisms. If Jennifer Tilly is a dead-on Lina Lamont, Dianne Weist Sinclar is a perfect Norma Desmond, an actress so wrapped up in her ego, she oozes a natural commanding presence, when she orders Shayne 'Don't speak' with a voice as low as possible, he knows it's an act, but still, he has no choice but obeying. Both Tilly and Wiest's performance earned them two deserved Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Wiest won). But had the film only relied on these performances and the great roles of Jim Broadbent and Tracey Ullman, the result would have been a charming little comedy, with no impact whatsoever. To give you an idea, there's a moment when Shayne has a drink with Sinclair, she orders two martinis, in fact the two martinis were for her. The gag is cleverly written, it's funny, but coming from Woody Allen, it didn't have that extra little spice I expected, granted the film is magnificently directed, with costumes and art-directing revisiting the roaring twenties with exuberance, there was not much to hook our hearts on. But then, in the middle of one rehearsal, when the actors and Shayne have an argument about the script, Cheech intervenes. The thug who exuded intimidation and street-smart force, suggests a little revision to the play, and guess what, it works. I knew Chazz Palminteri was Oscar-nominated for this role, I thought he would play in the stage, I thought everything except the fact that he would reveal the genius Shayne obviously lacks. Then the movie took off and turned into a clever and insightful commentary about the meaning of being an artist, creating an oeuvre and being so passionate about it that you wouldn't let anything undermine it, anyone interfere with it. It's about the conflict tormenting a man who tries to be an artist, only to be confronted to another who's genuinely an artist, much more a genius. The romantic subplot involving Shayne and Sinclair takes a whole new importance to the story. When Shayne discusses with his friend Sheldon (Rob Reiner) about it, Sheldon makes one of the most unforgettable statement from any Woody Allen's film: "an artist creates his own moral universe". It seems like an alibi to justify the craziest actions committed by an artist, in fact, it echoes the very actions committed by Cheech, out of love and passion for his work, that will push to the extreme the notion of "moral universe". The brilliance of the script is that Cheech' actions illustrate both what he is and what Shayne is not. And again, Woody Allen is able to transcend usual movie archetypes and illustrate through them the deepest torments invading the heart of artists and wannabe artists. Woody Allen shows the gap between those who got the talent, and those who don't, and he's so talented that he's even able to create a great character who realizes that he doesn't have the talent. The ending of "Bullets Over Broadway" is not the apotheosis we expected, but it's not a downer either. Shayne is finally able to realize what counts for him and what doesn't, it's about knowing oneself and acting in consequence. It's about responsibility, and the level of maturity expressed in the ending is so unexpected it does highlight the hidden genius of the script. And as nothing is gratuitous in a great script, first, its greatness relies on a fascinating contradiction, and I'll never forget the thug with writing genius played by Chazz Palminteri. And even a cute inoffensive gag like Olive not remembering what came after Hamlet's "To be" is a subtle reference to the main conflict of the film. To be an artist or not to be an artist,  to be or not to be, and "Bullets Over Broadway" provides some of the smartest answers to that eternal question.

But his luck ends when the play's financier, a mobster (Joe Viterelli) gives the ultimate that his girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly) must have a part on the show, but she has never acted before. The guy gets toyed by this goofy and demanding new actress, by her tough bodyguard (Chazz Palminteri) who'll try to change the play's script, always bothered by the "irrealism" of it; and at last the less negative interference of Sinclair, of whom he madly falls in love with. As the movie progresses we keep asking ourselves: "There's a real chance of this play ever become a hit?" and "How does this writer will ever make his way through fame with such interferences?". While the work of his life gets deconstructed in a turbulence of confusion we keep laughing at all of his drama, or at the other characters eccentric ways of doing things. Outrageously comical "Bullets Over Broadway" is Woody Allen's sound and fury on the power of artistic creations and how they happen, and the way they're developed, constantly changing from what they used to be. Here's a treasure to be admired; it leaves you in a complete state of amazement, a powerful ecstasy. Hilarious situations are wonderfully created, not a single moment is wasted or let down, everything is a feast for our senses from the magnificent casting to the art direction, costumes and cinematography. Allen at his greatest, so enjoy the spectacle! 10/10

    A film so criminally overrated and staggeringly unfunny as to defy description. Allen takes a very promising concept and somehow manages to craft a film that is devoid of hilarity. Idealistic playwright John Cusack finds the backing to mount his play from a gangster. The catch is that in return the gangster's bimbo mistress Jennifer Tilly is to be cast as a psychiatrist in the play. Henchman Chazz Palminteri is dispatched to babysit Tilly and coach her in acting, but in the process makes suggestions to Cusack's play that dramatically improve its quality. This should be hilarious - yet it is not. I don't think I cracked a smile once during the entire course of the film. I have begun to believe that it is utterly impossible for Allen to write genuinely likable or appealing characters - even within the constraints of a broad fable such as this one. Nearly everyone we see on screen is selfish, obnoxious and nasty. Too many scenes are directed as though by chaos. For instance, I lost count of how many scenes start or ended with a group of characters stationed at different points of the set and shrieking their lines at each other, often at the same time, so that the scene is reduced to a wall of incoherent noise. While Allen thankfully delivers us from taking on the leading man duties again, Cusack is simply too bland and uninteresting to hold attention or anchor the action. Tracey Ullman, Mary-Louise Parker and Jim Broadbent are wasted in underwritten roles. Dianne Wiest gets to ham it up as a legendary Broadway diva brought in to headline the show. While she throws herself body and soul into the part, her lampoon of the haughty dowager becomes repetitive. This is a fault of the screenplay more than the actress. She is playing a caricature and one that we have seen done better and funnier in other films. The first time she strikes a pose like Greta Garbo and admonishes Cusack "Don't speak!" is barely amusing. By the umpteenth time she has done this throughout the film, it has ceased to have any comedic impact at all. Apparently the majority of the comedy is supposed to come from the interactions between Palminteri's flustered gun man and Tilly's bimbo. Unfortunately, their scenes are incredibly unpleasant. Palminteri is stuck playing a stereotypical goombah (with the twist that he writes better than Cusack) and Tilly is the quintessential floozy. Both of them hate each - and I mean they really hate each other. Their line readings are loud and shrill and generate all of the charm of a legion of car alarms going off at the same time. There is almost a collective sigh of relief when their scenes conclude and their dialog pretty much goes along the lines of "Why don't you shut up!", "No, you shut up!", "You shut up!", and "You shut up yourself!" Oh, the hilarity. It must have taken Allen all of five minutes to fabricate this winning dialog. By the time the film itself rolls to its unsurprising conclusion, one realizes that you don't care about any of these characters and you want back the time that Allen and his minions have stolen from your life. A real endurance test akin to dental surgery without benefit of Novacaine.

    Another wonderful Woody Allen comedy, this film is all about playwright David Shayne (John Cusack) and just how far he will compromise his artistic integrity to get himself and his play talked about in all the right circles by all the right people. This leads to him allowing a gangster's moll (Jennifer Tilly) to play a main part, becoming smitten with an ageing starlet (the wonderful Dianne Wiest, never in better comic form), being helped in rewrites by the man (Chazz Palminteri) chosen to look after the gangster's moll and generally dealing with a number of strange people who need careful attention paid to their egos (Tracey Ullman and Jim Broadbent being the other main pair). Written (with Douglas McGrath) and directed by Allen, as usual, this movie may not be the most intelligent or most philosophical in the New Yorker's illustrious career but it deftly blends a lot of genuine fun and laugh out loud moments with some minor musing on just what the artist needs in his life to fill his heart. Fleeting acceptance or genuine love? All of the performances are splendid (with the top marks going to Tilly, Broadbent and Wiest) and while some may feel that the characters are rather broadly played for easy laughs I tend to think that each one gets just enough time on screen to be more than just a one-joke caricature. But I would say that, simply due to the fact that I could watch Dianne Wiest saying "don't speak" on a constant loop (just watch the movie and you'll know what I mean). Warm, witty and full of great actors, I rank this as one of my favourite Woody Allen movies and hope others love it too.

    Woody Allen will always be remembered as a director who could create situations in which characters talk frequently and superbly. In this film, he puts together his spin on life and conversation with the setting of the 1920s Broadway background to create a memorable and sweet film about a group of people that we become so enamored with that they turn out to be more than characters; they become human beings on screen. A terrific cast bolsters this already fine story as we witness a young, idealistic writer/director of the stage (John Cusack) attempt to have his play unscathed by the actors. He soon casts a great Margo Channing-type legend (Dianne Weist), a wacky side-lady (Tracy Ullman), a great actor with an eating fetish and a mobster's girlfriend attempting to break into acting but doesn't quite have the chops. The key to the whole story is the character of the mobster's hit-man, played by Chazz Palmenteri who turns out to be the most theatrically sophisticated and wise of all the characters. Here, Allen shows that genius can come from the most unlikely of sources and also uses it to bring out a number of great comical scenes as well. I guess the best thing to say about this movie is how wonderful Woody Allen's writing is. By this time, he has gotten down the pacing and rhythm so perfectly that it truly is an art-form for him to write screenplays. And, as always in a Woody Allen movie, the actors are terrific and have great fun by playing the parts with gusto and joy. This is a much lighter effort than say, Husbands and Wives or Crimes and Misdemeanors, but it stays in the tradition of Allen able to mix together great dialogue, unique characters and a story that unfolds so easily and delightfully. A treasure unlike any other, Woody Allen creates a fun film one right after the other.

    "Bullets Over Broadway" doesn't work for the same reason other Woody Allen comedies he's written but not starred in don't work. It's very simple, having someone else playing a character that has all the Woody insecurities and mannerisms leaves one wishing for Allen to be playing the part, and feeling cheated that he isn't in the film. Such is the case with John Cusack's playwright character. What you get is a Woody Allen clone that simply can't deliver the comedy intended by Allen. The cast is game, but fine comedians Jennifer Tilly, Jack Warden, and Rob Reiner, don't deliver enough chuckles to overcome the lack of Woody Allen playing the part he obviously was meant to play. - MERK

    Never underestimate Woody Allen's capability to surprise you. The first act "Bullets Over Broadway" didn't put my expectations very high, until an expected little twist in the middle transformed everything and contributed to one of Woody Allen's most fascinating secondary characters. The film opens in the 1928 Broadway, with one cinematic archetype following another. John Cusack is David Shayne, a young playwright. Convinced of his artistic genius, he's your typical struggling newcomer trying to impose his unique style. Not a revolutionary character, Cusack almost replays some mimics of Allen's neurotic writer, only differing physically, with his tall frame canceled by his constantly hunched demeanor, he's handsome enough to make his sex-appeal believable. Although with such a title as "God of Our Fathers", the line between the very talent he claims to have and a sort of pompous pseudo-intellectual vibe is very thin, but we give him the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, Shayne's manager, played by Jack Warden, finds a generous heart accepting to finance the play. Not your typical patron of art, the man is Valenti, a mobster played by the irreplaceable Joe Viterelli. Theater is not his cup of tea but who cares, he's absolutely in love with Olive, his girlfriend, a dancer as ambitious as she's talentless. With her nasal voice, voluptuous forms and misplaced self-satisfaction, Jennifer Tilly revives the performance of Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont in "Singin' in the Rain", with I don't think that was even possible- a much more horrible voice. And no one can even say a word against her, all through the rehearsals, she's chaperoned by a bodyguard named Cheech, one of Viterelli's button-man, more at ease with playing craps and disposing of some bodies, than enduring Shayne's intellectual junk. To go on and on with archetypes, Shayne lives with Ellen, his caring girlfriend, played by Mary Louise Parker, but she lacks the flamboyance and charisma of her soon-to-be rival, Helen Sinclair. Sinclair is the obligatory diva, who played so much plays, worked with so many writers (always the best) that all her characters spill over her mannerisms. If Jennifer Tilly is a dead-on Lina Lamont, Dianne Weist Sinclar is a perfect Norma Desmond, an actress so wrapped up in her ego, she oozes a natural commanding presence, when she orders Shayne 'Don't speak' with a voice as low as possible, he knows it's an act, but still, he has no choice but obeying. Both Tilly and Wiest's performance earned them two deserved Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Wiest won). But had the film only relied on these performances and the great roles of Jim Broadbent and Tracey Ullman, the result would have been a charming little comedy, with no impact whatsoever. To give you an idea, there's a moment when Shayne has a drink with Sinclair, she orders two martinis, in fact the two martinis were for her. The gag is cleverly written, it's funny, but coming from Woody Allen, it didn't have that extra little spice I expected, granted the film is magnificently directed, with costumes and art-directing revisiting the roaring twenties with exuberance, there was not much to hook our hearts on. But then, in the middle of one rehearsal, when the actors and Shayne have an argument about the script, Cheech intervenes. The thug who exuded intimidation and street-smart force, suggests a little revision to the play, and guess what, it works. I knew Chazz Palminteri was Oscar-nominated for this role, I thought he would play in the stage, I thought everything except the fact that he would reveal the genius Shayne obviously lacks. Then the movie took off and turned into a clever and insightful commentary about the meaning of being an artist, creating an oeuvre and being so passionate about it that you wouldn't let anything undermine it, anyone interfere with it. It's about the conflict tormenting a man who tries to be an artist, only to be confronted to another who's genuinely an artist, much more a genius. The romantic subplot involving Shayne and Sinclair takes a whole new importance to the story. When Shayne discusses with his friend Sheldon (Rob Reiner) about it, Sheldon makes one of the most unforgettable statement from any Woody Allen's film: "an artist creates his own moral universe". It seems like an alibi to justify the craziest actions committed by an artist, in fact, it echoes the very actions committed by Cheech, out of love and passion for his work, that will push to the extreme the notion of "moral universe". The brilliance of the script is that Cheech' actions illustrate both what he is and what Shayne is not. And again, Woody Allen is able to transcend usual movie archetypes and illustrate through them the deepest torments invading the heart of artists and wannabe artists. Woody Allen shows the gap between those who got the talent, and those who don't, and he's so talented that he's even able to create a great character who realizes that he doesn't have the talent. The ending of "Bullets Over Broadway" is not the apotheosis we expected, but it's not a downer either. Shayne is finally able to realize what counts for him and what doesn't, it's about knowing oneself and acting in consequence. It's about responsibility, and the level of maturity expressed in the ending is so unexpected it does highlight the hidden genius of the script. And as nothing is gratuitous in a great script, first, its greatness relies on a fascinating contradiction, and I'll never forget the thug with writing genius played by Chazz Palminteri. And even a cute inoffensive gag like Olive not remembering what came after Hamlet's "To be" is a subtle reference to the main conflict of the film. To be an artist or not to be an artist,  to be or not to be, and "Bullets Over Broadway" provides some of the smartest answers to that eternal question.

    Woody Allen successfully combines gangsters and Broadway theater in this riveting comedy that earned seven Academy Award nominations. John Cusack stars in the leading role, doing his best Woody Allen impression of course, as David Shayne, a playwright who has to cast a mobster's girlfriend in one of the starring roles. She is given a body guard named Cheech, played by Chazz Polminteri, who has to sit back and keep an eye on her during rehearsals. As the show starts to come together Cheech has some ideas of his own about the show, and they end up making it a better play than the one David originally wrote. This comedic turn of events fuels the rest of this lively and genuinely funny film. Bullets Over Broadway is simply more of Woody Allen doing what Woody Allen does best. It's quick, witty, whimsical, and intelligently hilarious. It's a great story full of wildly eccentric characters played by an ensemble of great actors. It possesses that engaging Woody Allen cadence full of all the Woody Allen quirkiness that makes us love watching his films. Bullets Over Broadway has a lot of charm and delivers a lot of laughs. There's nothing revolutionary here, but Bullets Over Broadway shows us a great time with all its witticism and frivolous ingenuity. Woody Allen is a pure genius, and he always seems to know exactly what he is doing when he makes a film. His specialty is quirky comedy, so it's no surprise that Bullets Over Broadway is just a great film. The story is simple yet effectively hysterical, and the characters are brilliantly constructed and wonderfully written, each displaying their own quirky uniqueness that becomes part of clever quirky whole. This is a great film, and one that continues to show what a brilliant man Woody Allen is.

    As Woody Allen's MIDNIGHT IN Paris (2011, a 6/10) doesn't impress me much and his latest Italian carol TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) gets horrifying feedbacks, so I fumble around his earlier oeuvre, thanks to his prolific filmography, thus comes BULLETS OVER Broadway (a 7 Oscar nomination receiver in 1994) courtesy of one simple criterion, more often than not, films in which Woody is not starred are much better than in which he is both the director/writer and the actor. I have only watched a handful of Woody's films, but BULLETS OVER Broadway could easily sit in the top row of any years-best list (for me, it just misses my top 10 film in 1994, which is an ultra-competitive year for films, but Cusack, Wiest, Tilly and Palminteri all crack into my top 10 acting rankings). Wiest and Tilly, obtained two Oscar nominations and Wiest was the final winner, who is divinely lofty and my pick as well, she is simply amazing in her delivering of the repetitive "don't speak" lines and the voice warm-up scenes before the final premier. Meanwhile Tilly is plainly acting herself (being slightly amusing and largely annoying), this is an exact example of the disparagement between a bona fide actress and an one-off sensation (Palminteri's Oscar nomination may also belong to be the latter unfortunately), notwithstanding the fact that most acting laborers will never even procure such an opportunity, for instance John Cusack, who is playing Woody Allen in the film and is reliably superb but regrettably snubbed again (after THE GRIFTERS 1990, a 7/10). Speaking of the film, the script has Woody's distinctive bourgeoisie and artist self-mockery in it and the genre mash-up of gangster comedy and a Broadway playwright trapped in his writer's block works adroitly well, although the shooting shots are not Woody's strong suit and the diamond-in-the-rough deployment is over-simplified (maybe there is just no reason beyond it). But on the whole, the witty conversations will always strike a chord if you are an ordinary man with a highbrow heart, and in the final analysis, Diane Wiest alone is worth the time.

    Mr.Cinema aka Woody Allen delivers one of his finest films in 'Bullets Over Broadway', a delicious comedy, that's magnificently written, sharply directed & amazingly performed. Its humorous cinema at its finest hour! 'Bullets Over Broadway' Synopsis: In 1920s New York, a struggling playwright is forced to cast a mobster's talentless girlfriend in his latest drama in order to get it produced. 'Bullets Over Broadway' is a delicious comedy, that's magnificently written by Allen & Douglas McGrath. The characters, the entire set-up is so interesting & funny, that there is hardly a moment when the film falters. Allen's Direction is sharp! Cinematography by Carlo DiPalma is excellent. Editing is good. Performance-Wise: Dianne Wiest won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress & she deserved too. She delivers a career best performance. John Cusack is fantastic. Seriously, why is he so under-rated? Jennifer Tilly is marvelous, while Chazz Palminteri takes an unforgettable turn. Jack Warden is always terrific. Mary-Louise Parker leaves a mark. Tracey Ullman & Jim Broadbent are outstanding. On the whole, 'Bullets Over Broadway' is a must see.

    Woody at his best. A movie about artists - not only about writers ( but mostly about them ), but about any artist, who is trapped between his talent and the expectations that other people have about him. A movie about what it takes to make something perfect. I strongly consider John Cusack's ( David ) character and Chazz Palminteri's ( Cheech ) character as different sides of the same person - the bohemian, who sees in art just an excuse for meeting famous people and living like them and the real artist, for whom art and creating are only reasons to live. And the moral? I guess no one can say it better than David's girlfriend - one could not love an artist if he hasn't got enough dignity to be a man in the first place.

    Because they would take advantage of you with such positive remark. Artists and criminals and their little and complex worlds of being powerful gods, creatures who can create and destroy at the same time. The power of the criminals, gangsters in this case, are the use of his weapons against their enemies or whoever appears on their way; artists like the play writer/director in this film has the power of creativity, words are carefully chosen, scenes and dialogs are marvelously written in order to make the most fantastic creation of all, and the writer has the final word on everything. Well, almost everything. John Cusack's character is a down-on-luck author who finally gets the chance of developing his play in the way he wants, at first by resurrecting the career of diva Helen Sinclair (Dianne Wiest) and selecting his favorite actors. But his luck ends when the play's financier, a mobster (Joe Viterelli) gives the ultimate that his girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly) must have a part on the show, but she has never acted before. The guy gets toyed by this goofy and demanding new actress, by her tough bodyguard (Chazz Palminteri) who'll try to change the play's script, always bothered by the "irrealism" of it; and at last the less negative interference of Sinclair, of whom he madly falls in love with.

Here's a treasure to be admired; it leaves you in a complete state of amazement, a powerful ecstasy. Hilarious situations are wonderfully created, not a single moment is wasted or let down, everything is a feast for our senses from the magnificent casting to the art direction, costumes and cinematography.

    "Bullets Over Broadway" doesn't work for the same reason other Woody Allen comedies he's written but not starred in don't work. It's very simple, having someone else playing a character that has all the Woody insecurities and mannerisms leaves one wishing for Allen to be playing the part, and feeling cheated that he isn't in the film. Such is the case with John Cusack's playwright character. What you get is a Woody Allen clone that simply can't deliver the comedy intended by Allen. The cast is game, but fine comedians Jennifer Tilly, Jack Warden, and Rob Reiner, don't deliver enough chuckles to overcome the lack of Woody Allen playing the part he obviously was meant to play. - MERK

    Never underestimate Woody Allen's capability to surprise you. The first act "Bullets Over Broadway" didn't put my expectations very high, until an expected little twist in the middle transformed everything and contributed to one of Woody Allen's most fascinating secondary characters. The film opens in the 1928 Broadway, with one cinematic archetype following another. John Cusack is David Shayne, a young playwright. Convinced of his artistic genius, he's your typical struggling newcomer trying to impose his unique style. Not a revolutionary character, Cusack almost replays some mimics of Allen's neurotic writer, only differing physically, with his tall frame canceled by his constantly hunched demeanor, he's handsome enough to make his sex-appeal believable. Although with such a title as "God of Our Fathers", the line between the very talent he claims to have and a sort of pompous pseudo-intellectual vibe is very thin, but we give him the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, Shayne's manager, played by Jack Warden, finds a generous heart accepting to finance the play. Not your typical patron of art, the man is Valenti, a mobster played by the irreplaceable Joe Viterelli. Theater is not his cup of tea but who cares, he's absolutely in love with Olive, his girlfriend, a dancer as ambitious as she's talentless. With her nasal voice, voluptuous forms and misplaced self-satisfaction, Jennifer Tilly revives the performance of Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont in "Singin' in the Rain", with I don't think that was even possible- a much more horrible voice. And no one can even say a word against her, all through the rehearsals, she's chaperoned by a bodyguard named Cheech, one of Viterelli's button-man, more at ease with playing craps and disposing of some bodies, than enduring Shayne's intellectual junk. To go on and on with archetypes, Shayne lives with Ellen, his caring girlfriend, played by Mary Louise Parker, but she lacks the flamboyance and charisma of her soon-to-be rival, Helen Sinclair. Sinclair is the obligatory diva, who played so much plays, worked with so many writers (always the best) that all her characters spill over her mannerisms. If Jennifer Tilly is a dead-on Lina Lamont, Dianne Weist Sinclar is a perfect Norma Desmond, an actress so wrapped up in her ego, she oozes a natural commanding presence, when she orders Shayne 'Don't speak' with a voice as low as possible, he knows it's an act, but still, he has no choice but obeying. Both Tilly and Wiest's performance earned them two deserved Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Wiest won). But had the film only relied on these performances and the great roles of Jim Broadbent and Tracey Ullman, the result would have been a charming little comedy, with no impact whatsoever. To give you an idea, there's a moment when Shayne has a drink with Sinclair, she orders two martinis, in fact the two martinis were for her. The gag is cleverly written, it's funny, but coming from Woody Allen, it didn't have that extra little spice I expected, granted the film is magnificently directed, with costumes and art-directing revisiting the roaring twenties with exuberance, there was not much to hook our hearts on. But then, in the middle of one rehearsal, when the actors and Shayne have an argument about the script, Cheech intervenes. The thug who exuded intimidation and street-smart force, suggests a little revision to the play, and guess what, it works. I knew Chazz Palminteri was Oscar-nominated for this role, I thought he would play in the stage, I thought everything except the fact that he would reveal the genius Shayne obviously lacks. Then the movie took off and turned into a clever and insightful commentary about the meaning of being an artist, creating an oeuvre and being so passionate about it that you wouldn't let anything undermine it, anyone interfere with it. It's about the conflict tormenting a man who tries to be an artist, only to be confronted to another who's genuinely an artist, much more a genius. The romantic subplot involving Shayne and Sinclair takes a whole new importance to the story. When Shayne discusses with his friend Sheldon (Rob Reiner) about it, Sheldon makes one of the most unforgettable statement from any Woody Allen's film: "an artist creates his own moral universe". It seems like an alibi to justify the craziest actions committed by an artist, in fact, it echoes the very actions committed by Cheech, out of love and passion for his work, that will push to the extreme the notion of "moral universe". The brilliance of the script is that Cheech' actions illustrate both what he is and what Shayne is not. And again, Woody Allen is able to transcend usual movie archetypes and illustrate through them the deepest torments invading the heart of artists and wannabe artists. Woody Allen shows the gap between those who got the talent, and those who don't, and he's so talented that he's even able to create a great character who realizes that he doesn't have the talent. The ending of "Bullets Over Broadway" is not the apotheosis we expected, but it's not a downer either. Shayne is finally able to realize what counts for him and what doesn't, it's about knowing oneself and acting in consequence. It's about responsibility, and the level of maturity expressed in the ending is so unexpected it does highlight the hidden genius of the script. And as nothing is gratuitous in a great script, first, its greatness relies on a fascinating contradiction, and I'll never forget the thug with writing genius played by Chazz Palminteri. And even a cute inoffensive gag like Olive not remembering what came after Hamlet's "To be" is a subtle reference to the main conflict of the film. To be an artist or not to be an artist,  to be or not to be, and "Bullets Over Broadway" provides some of the smartest answers to that eternal question.

    Woody Allen successfully combines gangsters and Broadway theater in this riveting comedy that earned seven Academy Award nominations. John Cusack stars in the leading role, doing his best Woody Allen impression of course, as David Shayne, a playwright who has to cast a mobster's girlfriend in one of the starring roles. She is given a body guard named Cheech, played by Chazz Polminteri, who has to sit back and keep an eye on her during rehearsals. As the show starts to come together Cheech has some ideas of his own about the show, and they end up making it a better play than the one David originally wrote. This comedic turn of events fuels the rest of this lively and genuinely funny film. Bullets Over Broadway is simply more of Woody Allen doing what Woody Allen does best. It's quick, witty, whimsical, and intelligently hilarious. It's a great story full of wildly eccentric characters played by an ensemble of great actors. It possesses that engaging Woody Allen cadence full of all the Woody Allen quirkiness that makes us love watching his films. Bullets Over Broadway has a lot of charm and delivers a lot of laughs. There's nothing revolutionary here, but Bullets Over Broadway shows us a great time with all its witticism and frivolous ingenuity. Woody Allen is a pure genius, and he always seems to know exactly what he is doing when he makes a film. His specialty is quirky comedy, so it's no surprise that Bullets Over Broadway is just a great film. The story is simple yet effectively hysterical, and the characters are brilliantly constructed and wonderfully written, each displaying their own quirky uniqueness that becomes part of clever quirky whole. This is a great film, and one that continues to show what a brilliant man Woody Allen is.

    As Woody Allen's MIDNIGHT IN Paris (2011, a 6/10) doesn't impress me much and his latest Italian carol TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) gets horrifying feedbacks, so I fumble around his earlier oeuvre, thanks to his prolific filmography, thus comes BULLETS OVER Broadway (a 7 Oscar nomination receiver in 1994) courtesy of one simple criterion, more often than not, films in which Woody is not starred are much better than in which he is both the director/writer and the actor. I have only watched a handful of Woody's films, but BULLETS OVER Broadway could easily sit in the top row of any years-best list (for me, it just misses my top 10 film in 1994, which is an ultra-competitive year for films, but Cusack, Wiest, Tilly and Palminteri all crack into my top 10 acting rankings). Wiest and Tilly, obtained two Oscar nominations and Wiest was the final winner, who is divinely lofty and my pick as well, she is simply amazing in her delivering of the repetitive "don't speak" lines and the voice warm-up scenes before the final premier. Meanwhile Tilly is plainly acting herself (being slightly amusing and largely annoying), this is an exact example of the disparagement between a bona fide actress and an one-off sensation (Palminteri's Oscar nomination may also belong to be the latter unfortunately), notwithstanding the fact that most acting laborers will never even procure such an opportunity, for instance John Cusack, who is playing Woody Allen in the film and is reliably superb but regrettably snubbed again (after THE GRIFTERS 1990, a 7/10). Speaking of the film, the script has Woody's distinctive bourgeoisie and artist self-mockery in it and the genre mash-up of gangster comedy and a Broadway playwright trapped in his writer's block works adroitly well, although the shooting shots are not Woody's strong suit and the diamond-in-the-rough deployment is over-simplified (maybe there is just no reason beyond it). But on the whole, the witty conversations will always strike a chord if you are an ordinary man with a highbrow heart, and in the final analysis, Diane Wiest alone is worth the time.

    Mr.Cinema aka Woody Allen delivers one of his finest films in 'Bullets Over Broadway', a delicious comedy, that's magnificently written, sharply directed & amazingly performed. Its humorous cinema at its finest hour! 'Bullets Over Broadway' Synopsis: In 1920s New York, a struggling playwright is forced to cast a mobster's talentless girlfriend in his latest drama in order to get it produced. 'Bullets Over Broadway' is a delicious comedy, that's magnificently written by Allen & Douglas McGrath. The characters, the entire set-up is so interesting & funny, that there is hardly a moment when the film falters. Allen's Direction is sharp! Cinematography by Carlo DiPalma is excellent. Editing is good. Performance-Wise: Dianne Wiest won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress & she deserved too. She delivers a career best performance. John Cusack is fantastic. Seriously, why is he so under-rated? Jennifer Tilly is marvelous, while Chazz Palminteri takes an unforgettable turn. Jack Warden is always terrific. Mary-Louise Parker leaves a mark. Tracey Ullman & Jim Broadbent are outstanding. On the whole, 'Bullets Over Broadway' is a must see.

    Woody at his best. A movie about artists - not only about writers ( but mostly about them ), but about any artist, who is trapped between his talent and the expectations that other people have about him. A movie about what it takes to make something perfect. I strongly consider John Cusack's ( David ) character and Chazz Palminteri's ( Cheech ) character as different sides of the same person - the bohemian, who sees in art just an excuse for meeting famous people and living like them and the real artist, for whom art and creating are only reasons to live. And the moral? I guess no one can say it better than David's girlfriend - one could not love an artist if he hasn't got enough dignity to be a man in the first place.

    Because they would take advantage of you with such positive remark. Artists and criminals and their little and complex worlds of being powerful gods, creatures who can create and destroy at the same time. The power of the criminals, gangsters in this case, are the use of his weapons against their enemies or whoever appears on their way; artists like the play writer/director in this film has the power of creativity, words are carefully chosen, scenes and dialogs are marvelously written in order to make the most fantastic creation of all, and the writer has the final word on everything. Well, almost everything. John Cusack's character is a down-on-luck author who finally gets the chance of developing his play in the way he wants, at first by resurrecting the career of diva Helen Sinclair (Dianne Wiest) and selecting his favorite actors. But his luck ends when the play's financier, a mobster (Joe Viterelli) gives the ultimate that his girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly) must have a part on the show, but she has never acted before. The guy gets toyed by this goofy and demanding new actress, by her tough bodyguard (Chazz Palminteri) who'll try to change the play's script, always bothered by the "irrealism" of it; and at last the less negative interference of Sinclair, of whom he madly falls in love with. As the movie progresses we keep asking ourselves: "There's a real chance of this play ever become a hit?" and "How does this writer will ever make his way through fame with such interferences?". While the work of his life gets deconstructed in a turbulence of confusion we keep laughing at all of his drama, or at the other characters eccentric ways of doing things. Outrageously comical "Bullets Over Broadway" is Woody Allen's sound and fury on the power of artistic creations and how they happen, and the way they're developed, constantly changing from what they used to be. Here's a treasure to be admired; it leaves you in a complete state of amazement, a powerful ecstasy. Hilarious situations are wonderfully created, not a single moment is wasted or let down, everything is a feast for our senses from the magnificent casting to the art direction, costumes and cinematography. Allen at his greatest, so enjoy the spectacle! 10/10

    A film so criminally overrated and staggeringly unfunny as to defy description. Allen takes a very promising concept and somehow manages to craft a film that is devoid of hilarity. Idealistic playwright John Cusack finds the backing to mount his play from a gangster. The catch is that in return the gangster's bimbo mistress Jennifer Tilly is to be cast as a psychiatrist in the play. Henchman Chazz Palminteri is dispatched to babysit Tilly and coach her in acting, but in the process makes suggestions to Cusack's play that dramatically improve its quality. This should be hilarious - yet it is not. I don't think I cracked a smile once during the entire course of the film. I have begun to believe that it is utterly impossible for Allen to write genuinely likable or appealing characters - even within the constraints of a broad fable such as this one. Nearly everyone we see on screen is selfish, obnoxious and nasty. Too many scenes are directed as though by chaos. For instance, I lost count of how many scenes start or ended with a group of characters stationed at different points of the set and shrieking their lines at each other, often at the same time, so that the scene is reduced to a wall of incoherent noise. While Allen thankfully delivers us from taking on the leading man duties again, Cusack is simply too bland and uninteresting to hold attention or anchor the action. Tracey Ullman, Mary-Louise Parker and Jim Broadbent are wasted in underwritten roles. Dianne Wiest gets to ham it up as a legendary Broadway diva brought in to headline the show. While she throws herself body and soul into the part, her lampoon of the haughty dowager becomes repetitive. This is a fault of the screenplay more than the actress. She is playing a caricature and one that we have seen done better and funnier in other films. The first time she strikes a pose like Greta Garbo and admonishes Cusack "Don't speak!" is barely amusing. By the umpteenth time she has done this throughout the film, it has ceased to have any comedic impact at all. Apparently the majority of the comedy is supposed to come from the interactions between Palminteri's flustered gun man and Tilly's bimbo. Unfortunately, their scenes are incredibly unpleasant. Palminteri is stuck playing a stereotypical goombah (with the twist that he writes better than Cusack) and Tilly is the quintessential floozy. Both of them hate each - and I mean they really hate each other. Their line readings are loud and shrill and generate all of the charm of a legion of car alarms going off at the same time. There is almost a collective sigh of relief when their scenes conclude and their dialog pretty much goes along the lines of "Why don't you shut up!", "No, you shut up!", "You shut up!", and "You shut up yourself!" Oh, the hilarity. It must have taken Allen all of five minutes to fabricate this winning dialog. By the time the film itself rolls to its unsurprising conclusion, one realizes that you don't care about any of these characters and you want back the time that Allen and his minions have stolen from your life. A real endurance test akin to dental surgery without benefit of Novacaine.

    Another wonderful Woody Allen comedy, this film is all about playwright David Shayne (John Cusack) and just how far he will compromise his artistic integrity to get himself and his play talked about in all the right circles by all the right people. This leads to him allowing a gangster's moll (Jennifer Tilly) to play a main part, becoming smitten with an ageing starlet (the wonderful Dianne Wiest, never in better comic form), being helped in rewrites by the man (Chazz Palminteri) chosen to look after the gangster's moll and generally dealing with a number of strange people who need careful attention paid to their egos (Tracey Ullman and Jim Broadbent being the other main pair). Written (with Douglas McGrath) and directed by Allen, as usual, this movie may not be the most intelligent or most philosophical in the New Yorker's illustrious career but it deftly blends a lot of genuine fun and laugh out loud moments with some minor musing on just what the artist needs in his life to fill his heart. Fleeting acceptance or genuine love? All of the performances are splendid (with the top marks going to Tilly, Broadbent and Wiest) and while some may feel that the characters are rather broadly played for easy laughs I tend to think that each one gets just enough time on screen to be more than just a one-joke caricature. But I would say that, simply due to the fact that I could watch Dianne Wiest saying "don't speak" on a constant loop (just watch the movie and you'll know what I mean). Warm, witty and full of great actors, I rank this as one of my favourite Woody Allen movies and hope others love it too.

    Woody Allen will always be remembered as a director who could create situations in which characters talk frequently and superbly. In this film, he puts together his spin on life and conversation with the setting of the 1920s Broadway background to create a memorable and sweet film about a group of people that we become so enamored with that they turn out to be more than characters; they become human beings on screen. A terrific cast bolsters this already fine story as we witness a young, idealistic writer/director of the stage (John Cusack) attempt to have his play unscathed by the actors. He soon casts a great Margo Channing-type legend (Dianne Weist), a wacky side-lady (Tracy Ullman), a great actor with an eating fetish and a mobster's girlfriend attempting to break into acting but doesn't quite have the chops. The key to the whole story is the character of the mobster's hit-man, played by Chazz Palmenteri who turns out to be the most theatrically sophisticated and wise of all the characters. Here, Allen shows that genius can come from the most unlikely of sources and also uses it to bring out a number of great comical scenes as well. I guess the best thing to say about this movie is how wonderful Woody Allen's writing is. By this time, he has gotten down the pacing and rhythm so perfectly that it truly is an art-form for him to write screenplays. And, as always in a Woody Allen movie, the actors are terrific and have great fun by playing the parts with gusto and joy. This is a much lighter effort than say, Husbands and Wives or Crimes and Misdemeanors, but it stays in the tradition of Allen able to mix together great dialogue, unique characters and a story that unfolds so easily and delightfully. A treasure unlike any other, Woody Allen creates a fun film one right after the other.

John Cusack stars in the leading role, doing his best Woody Allen impression of course, as David Shayne, a playwright who has to cast a mobster's girlfriend in one of the starring roles.

    As Woody Allen's MIDNIGHT IN Paris (2011, a 6/10) doesn't impress me much and his latest Italian carol TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) gets horrifying feedbacks, so I fumble around his earlier oeuvre, thanks to his prolific filmography, thus comes BULLETS OVER Broadway (a 7 Oscar nomination receiver in 1994) courtesy of one simple criterion, more often than not, films in which Woody is not starred are much better than in which he is both the director/writer and the actor. I have only watched a handful of Woody's films, but BULLETS OVER Broadway could easily sit in the top row of any years-best list (for me, it just misses my top 10 film in 1994, which is an ultra-competitive year for films, but Cusack, Wiest, Tilly and Palminteri all crack into my top 10 acting rankings). Wiest and Tilly, obtained two Oscar nominations and Wiest was the final winner, who is divinely lofty and my pick as well, she is simply amazing in her delivering of the repetitive "don't speak" lines and the voice warm-up scenes before the final premier. Meanwhile Tilly is plainly acting herself (being slightly amusing and largely annoying), this is an exact example of the disparagement between a bona fide actress and an one-off sensation (Palminteri's Oscar nomination may also belong to be the latter unfortunately), notwithstanding the fact that most acting laborers will never even procure such an opportunity, for instance John Cusack, who is playing Woody Allen in the film and is reliably superb but regrettably snubbed again (after THE GRIFTERS 1990, a 7/10). Speaking of the film, the script has Woody's distinctive bourgeoisie and artist self-mockery in it and the genre mash-up of gangster comedy and a Broadway playwright trapped in his writer's block works adroitly well, although the shooting shots are not Woody's strong suit and the diamond-in-the-rough deployment is over-simplified (maybe there is just no reason beyond it). But on the whole, the witty conversations will always strike a chord if you are an ordinary man with a highbrow heart, and in the final analysis, Diane Wiest alone is worth the time.

    Mr.Cinema aka Woody Allen delivers one of his finest films in 'Bullets Over Broadway', a delicious comedy, that's magnificently written, sharply directed & amazingly performed. Its humorous cinema at its finest hour! 'Bullets Over Broadway' Synopsis: In 1920s New York, a struggling playwright is forced to cast a mobster's talentless girlfriend in his latest drama in order to get it produced. 'Bullets Over Broadway' is a delicious comedy, that's magnificently written by Allen & Douglas McGrath. The characters, the entire set-up is so interesting & funny, that there is hardly a moment when the film falters. Allen's Direction is sharp! Cinematography by Carlo DiPalma is excellent. Editing is good. Performance-Wise: Dianne Wiest won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress & she deserved too. She delivers a career best performance. John Cusack is fantastic. Seriously, why is he so under-rated? Jennifer Tilly is marvelous, while Chazz Palminteri takes an unforgettable turn. Jack Warden is always terrific. Mary-Louise Parker leaves a mark. Tracey Ullman & Jim Broadbent are outstanding. On the whole, 'Bullets Over Broadway' is a must see.

    Woody at his best. A movie about artists - not only about writers ( but mostly about them ), but about any artist, who is trapped between his talent and the expectations that other people have about him. A movie about what it takes to make something perfect. I strongly consider John Cusack's ( David ) character and Chazz Palminteri's ( Cheech ) character as different sides of the same person - the bohemian, who sees in art just an excuse for meeting famous people and living like them and the real artist, for whom art and creating are only reasons to live. And the moral? I guess no one can say it better than David's girlfriend - one could not love an artist if he hasn't got enough dignity to be a man in the first place.

    Because they would take advantage of you with such positive remark. Artists and criminals and their little and complex worlds of being powerful gods, creatures who can create and destroy at the same time. The power of the criminals, gangsters in this case, are the use of his weapons against their enemies or whoever appears on their way; artists like the play writer/director in this film has the power of creativity, words are carefully chosen, scenes and dialogs are marvelously written in order to make the most fantastic creation of all, and the writer has the final word on everything. Well, almost everything. John Cusack's character is a down-on-luck author who finally gets the chance of developing his play in the way he wants, at first by resurrecting the career of diva Helen Sinclair (Dianne Wiest) and selecting his favorite actors. But his luck ends when the play's financier, a mobster (Joe Viterelli) gives the ultimate that his girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly) must have a part on the show, but she has never acted before. The guy gets toyed by this goofy and demanding new actress, by her tough bodyguard (Chazz Palminteri) who'll try to change the play's script, always bothered by the "irrealism" of it; and at last the less negative interference of Sinclair, of whom he madly falls in love with. As the movie progresses we keep asking ourselves: "There's a real chance of this play ever become a hit?" and "How does this writer will ever make his way through fame with such interferences?". While the work of his life gets deconstructed in a turbulence of confusion we keep laughing at all of his drama, or at the other characters eccentric ways of doing things. Outrageously comical "Bullets Over Broadway" is Woody Allen's sound and fury on the power of artistic creations and how they happen, and the way they're developed, constantly changing from what they used to be. Here's a treasure to be admired; it leaves you in a complete state of amazement, a powerful ecstasy. Hilarious situations are wonderfully created, not a single moment is wasted or let down, everything is a feast for our senses from the magnificent casting to the art direction, costumes and cinematography. Allen at his greatest, so enjoy the spectacle! 10/10

    A film so criminally overrated and staggeringly unfunny as to defy description. Allen takes a very promising concept and somehow manages to craft a film that is devoid of hilarity. Idealistic playwright John Cusack finds the backing to mount his play from a gangster. The catch is that in return the gangster's bimbo mistress Jennifer Tilly is to be cast as a psychiatrist in the play. Henchman Chazz Palminteri is dispatched to babysit Tilly and coach her in acting, but in the process makes suggestions to Cusack's play that dramatically improve its quality. This should be hilarious - yet it is not. I don't think I cracked a smile once during the entire course of the film. I have begun to believe that it is utterly impossible for Allen to write genuinely likable or appealing characters - even within the constraints of a broad fable such as this one. Nearly everyone we see on screen is selfish, obnoxious and nasty. Too many scenes are directed as though by chaos. For instance, I lost count of how many scenes start or ended with a group of characters stationed at different points of the set and shrieking their lines at each other, often at the same time, so that the scene is reduced to a wall of incoherent noise. While Allen thankfully delivers us from taking on the leading man duties again, Cusack is simply too bland and uninteresting to hold attention or anchor the action. Tracey Ullman, Mary-Louise Parker and Jim Broadbent are wasted in underwritten roles. Dianne Wiest gets to ham it up as a legendary Broadway diva brought in to headline the show. While she throws herself body and soul into the part, her lampoon of the haughty dowager becomes repetitive. This is a fault of the screenplay more than the actress. She is playing a caricature and one that we have seen done better and funnier in other films. The first time she strikes a pose like Greta Garbo and admonishes Cusack "Don't speak!" is barely amusing. By the umpteenth time she has done this throughout the film, it has ceased to have any comedic impact at all. Apparently the majority of the comedy is supposed to come from the interactions between Palminteri's flustered gun man and Tilly's bimbo. Unfortunately, their scenes are incredibly unpleasant. Palminteri is stuck playing a stereotypical goombah (with the twist that he writes better than Cusack) and Tilly is the quintessential floozy. Both of them hate each - and I mean they really hate each other. Their line readings are loud and shrill and generate all of the charm of a legion of car alarms going off at the same time. There is almost a collective sigh of relief when their scenes conclude and their dialog pretty much goes along the lines of "Why don't you shut up!", "No, you shut up!", "You shut up!", and "You shut up yourself!" Oh, the hilarity. It must have taken Allen all of five minutes to fabricate this winning dialog. By the time the film itself rolls to its unsurprising conclusion, one realizes that you don't care about any of these characters and you want back the time that Allen and his minions have stolen from your life. A real endurance test akin to dental surgery without benefit of Novacaine.

    Another wonderful Woody Allen comedy, this film is all about playwright David Shayne (John Cusack) and just how far he will compromise his artistic integrity to get himself and his play talked about in all the right circles by all the right people. This leads to him allowing a gangster's moll (Jennifer Tilly) to play a main part, becoming smitten with an ageing starlet (the wonderful Dianne Wiest, never in better comic form), being helped in rewrites by the man (Chazz Palminteri) chosen to look after the gangster's moll and generally dealing with a number of strange people who need careful attention paid to their egos (Tracey Ullman and Jim Broadbent being the other main pair). Written (with Douglas McGrath) and directed by Allen, as usual, this movie may not be the most intelligent or most philosophical in the New Yorker's illustrious career but it deftly blends a lot of genuine fun and laugh out loud moments with some minor musing on just what the artist needs in his life to fill his heart. Fleeting acceptance or genuine love? All of the performances are splendid (with the top marks going to Tilly, Broadbent and Wiest) and while some may feel that the characters are rather broadly played for easy laughs I tend to think that each one gets just enough time on screen to be more than just a one-joke caricature. But I would say that, simply due to the fact that I could watch Dianne Wiest saying "don't speak" on a constant loop (just watch the movie and you'll know what I mean). Warm, witty and full of great actors, I rank this as one of my favourite Woody Allen movies and hope others love it too.

    Woody Allen will always be remembered as a director who could create situations in which characters talk frequently and superbly. In this film, he puts together his spin on life and conversation with the setting of the 1920s Broadway background to create a memorable and sweet film about a group of people that we become so enamored with that they turn out to be more than characters; they become human beings on screen. A terrific cast bolsters this already fine story as we witness a young, idealistic writer/director of the stage (John Cusack) attempt to have his play unscathed by the actors. He soon casts a great Margo Channing-type legend (Dianne Weist), a wacky side-lady (Tracy Ullman), a great actor with an eating fetish and a mobster's girlfriend attempting to break into acting but doesn't quite have the chops. The key to the whole story is the character of the mobster's hit-man, played by Chazz Palmenteri who turns out to be the most theatrically sophisticated and wise of all the characters. Here, Allen shows that genius can come from the most unlikely of sources and also uses it to bring out a number of great comical scenes as well. I guess the best thing to say about this movie is how wonderful Woody Allen's writing is. By this time, he has gotten down the pacing and rhythm so perfectly that it truly is an art-form for him to write screenplays. And, as always in a Woody Allen movie, the actors are terrific and have great fun by playing the parts with gusto and joy. This is a much lighter effort than say, Husbands and Wives or Crimes and Misdemeanors, but it stays in the tradition of Allen able to mix together great dialogue, unique characters and a story that unfolds so easily and delightfully. A treasure unlike any other, Woody Allen creates a fun film one right after the other.

    "Bullets Over Broadway" doesn't work for the same reason other Woody Allen comedies he's written but not starred in don't work. It's very simple, having someone else playing a character that has all the Woody insecurities and mannerisms leaves one wishing for Allen to be playing the part, and feeling cheated that he isn't in the film. Such is the case with John Cusack's playwright character. What you get is a Woody Allen clone that simply can't deliver the comedy intended by Allen. The cast is game, but fine comedians Jennifer Tilly, Jack Warden, and Rob Reiner, don't deliver enough chuckles to overcome the lack of Woody Allen playing the part he obviously was meant to play. - MERK

    Never underestimate Woody Allen's capability to surprise you. The first act "Bullets Over Broadway" didn't put my expectations very high, until an expected little twist in the middle transformed everything and contributed to one of Woody Allen's most fascinating secondary characters. The film opens in the 1928 Broadway, with one cinematic archetype following another. John Cusack is David Shayne, a young playwright. Convinced of his artistic genius, he's your typical struggling newcomer trying to impose his unique style. Not a revolutionary character, Cusack almost replays some mimics of Allen's neurotic writer, only differing physically, with his tall frame canceled by his constantly hunched demeanor, he's handsome enough to make his sex-appeal believable. Although with such a title as "God of Our Fathers", the line between the very talent he claims to have and a sort of pompous pseudo-intellectual vibe is very thin, but we give him the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, Shayne's manager, played by Jack Warden, finds a generous heart accepting to finance the play. Not your typical patron of art, the man is Valenti, a mobster played by the irreplaceable Joe Viterelli. Theater is not his cup of tea but who cares, he's absolutely in love with Olive, his girlfriend, a dancer as ambitious as she's talentless. With her nasal voice, voluptuous forms and misplaced self-satisfaction, Jennifer Tilly revives the performance of Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont in "Singin' in the Rain", with I don't think that was even possible- a much more horrible voice. And no one can even say a word against her, all through the rehearsals, she's chaperoned by a bodyguard named Cheech, one of Viterelli's button-man, more at ease with playing craps and disposing of some bodies, than enduring Shayne's intellectual junk. To go on and on with archetypes, Shayne lives with Ellen, his caring girlfriend, played by Mary Louise Parker, but she lacks the flamboyance and charisma of her soon-to-be rival, Helen Sinclair. Sinclair is the obligatory diva, who played so much plays, worked with so many writers (always the best) that all her characters spill over her mannerisms. If Jennifer Tilly is a dead-on Lina Lamont, Dianne Weist Sinclar is a perfect Norma Desmond, an actress so wrapped up in her ego, she oozes a natural commanding presence, when she orders Shayne 'Don't speak' with a voice as low as possible, he knows it's an act, but still, he has no choice but obeying. Both Tilly and Wiest's performance earned them two deserved Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Wiest won). But had the film only relied on these performances and the great roles of Jim Broadbent and Tracey Ullman, the result would have been a charming little comedy, with no impact whatsoever. To give you an idea, there's a moment when Shayne has a drink with Sinclair, she orders two martinis, in fact the two martinis were for her. The gag is cleverly written, it's funny, but coming from Woody Allen, it didn't have that extra little spice I expected, granted the film is magnificently directed, with costumes and art-directing revisiting the roaring twenties with exuberance, there was not much to hook our hearts on. But then, in the middle of one rehearsal, when the actors and Shayne have an argument about the script, Cheech intervenes. The thug who exuded intimidation and street-smart force, suggests a little revision to the play, and guess what, it works. I knew Chazz Palminteri was Oscar-nominated for this role, I thought he would play in the stage, I thought everything except the fact that he would reveal the genius Shayne obviously lacks. Then the movie took off and turned into a clever and insightful commentary about the meaning of being an artist, creating an oeuvre and being so passionate about it that you wouldn't let anything undermine it, anyone interfere with it. It's about the conflict tormenting a man who tries to be an artist, only to be confronted to another who's genuinely an artist, much more a genius. The romantic subplot involving Shayne and Sinclair takes a whole new importance to the story. When Shayne discusses with his friend Sheldon (Rob Reiner) about it, Sheldon makes one of the most unforgettable statement from any Woody Allen's film: "an artist creates his own moral universe". It seems like an alibi to justify the craziest actions committed by an artist, in fact, it echoes the very actions committed by Cheech, out of love and passion for his work, that will push to the extreme the notion of "moral universe". The brilliance of the script is that Cheech' actions illustrate both what he is and what Shayne is not. And again, Woody Allen is able to transcend usual movie archetypes and illustrate through them the deepest torments invading the heart of artists and wannabe artists. Woody Allen shows the gap between those who got the talent, and those who don't, and he's so talented that he's even able to create a great character who realizes that he doesn't have the talent. The ending of "Bullets Over Broadway" is not the apotheosis we expected, but it's not a downer either. Shayne is finally able to realize what counts for him and what doesn't, it's about knowing oneself and acting in consequence. It's about responsibility, and the level of maturity expressed in the ending is so unexpected it does highlight the hidden genius of the script. And as nothing is gratuitous in a great script, first, its greatness relies on a fascinating contradiction, and I'll never forget the thug with writing genius played by Chazz Palminteri. And even a cute inoffensive gag like Olive not remembering what came after Hamlet's "To be" is a subtle reference to the main conflict of the film. To be an artist or not to be an artist,  to be or not to be, and "Bullets Over Broadway" provides some of the smartest answers to that eternal question.

    Woody Allen successfully combines gangsters and Broadway theater in this riveting comedy that earned seven Academy Award nominations. John Cusack stars in the leading role, doing his best Woody Allen impression of course, as David Shayne, a playwright who has to cast a mobster's girlfriend in one of the starring roles. She is given a body guard named Cheech, played by Chazz Polminteri, who has to sit back and keep an eye on her during rehearsals. As the show starts to come together Cheech has some ideas of his own about the show, and they end up making it a better play than the one David originally wrote. This comedic turn of events fuels the rest of this lively and genuinely funny film. Bullets Over Broadway is simply more of Woody Allen doing what Woody Allen does best. It's quick, witty, whimsical, and intelligently hilarious. It's a great story full of wildly eccentric characters played by an ensemble of great actors. It possesses that engaging Woody Allen cadence full of all the Woody Allen quirkiness that makes us love watching his films. Bullets Over Broadway has a lot of charm and delivers a lot of laughs. There's nothing revolutionary here, but Bullets Over Broadway shows us a great time with all its witticism and frivolous ingenuity. Woody Allen is a pure genius, and he always seems to know exactly what he is doing when he makes a film. His specialty is quirky comedy, so it's no surprise that Bullets Over Broadway is just a great film. The story is simple yet effectively hysterical, and the characters are brilliantly constructed and wonderfully written, each displaying their own quirky uniqueness that becomes part of clever quirky whole. This is a great film, and one that continues to show what a brilliant man Woody Allen is.

Tracey Ullman, Mary-Louise Parker and Jim Broadbent are wasted in underwritten roles. Dianne Wiest gets to ham it up as a legendary Broadway diva brought in to headline the show. While she throws herself body and soul into the part, her lampoon of the haughty dowager becomes repetitive. This is a fault of the screenplay more than the actress. She is playing a caricature and one that we have seen done better and funnier in other films. The first time she strikes a pose like Greta Garbo and admonishes Cusack "Don't speak!" is barely amusing. By the umpteenth time she has done this throughout the film, it has ceased to have any comedic impact at all. Apparently the majority of the comedy is supposed to come from the interactions between Palminteri's flustered gun man and Tilly's bimbo. Unfortunately, their scenes are incredibly unpleasant. Palminteri is stuck playing a stereotypical goombah (with the twist that he writes better than Cusack) and Tilly is the quintessential floozy. Both of them hate each - and I mean they really hate each other. Their line readings are loud and shrill and generate all of the charm of a legion of car alarms going off at the same time. There is almost a collective sigh of relief when their scenes conclude and their dialog pretty much goes along the lines of "Why don't you shut up!", "No, you shut up!", "You shut up!", and "You shut up yourself!" Oh, the hilarity. It must have taken Allen all of five minutes to fabricate this winning dialog. By the time the film itself rolls to its unsurprising conclusion, one realizes that you don't care about any of these characters and you want back the time that Allen and his minions have stolen from your life. A real endurance test akin to dental surgery without benefit of Novacaine.

    Another wonderful Woody Allen comedy, this film is all about playwright David Shayne (John Cusack) and just how far he will compromise his artistic integrity to get himself and his play talked about in all the right circles by all the right people. This leads to him allowing a gangster's moll (Jennifer Tilly) to play a main part, becoming smitten with an ageing starlet (the wonderful Dianne Wiest, never in better comic form), being helped in rewrites by the man (Chazz Palminteri) chosen to look after the gangster's moll and generally dealing with a number of strange people who need careful attention paid to their egos (Tracey Ullman and Jim Broadbent being the other main pair). Written (with Douglas McGrath) and directed by Allen, as usual, this movie may not be the most intelligent or most philosophical in the New Yorker's illustrious career but it deftly blends a lot of genuine fun and laugh out loud moments with some minor musing on just what the artist needs in his life to fill his heart. Fleeting acceptance or genuine love? All of the performances are splendid (with the top marks going to Tilly, Broadbent and Wiest) and while some may feel that the characters are rather broadly played for easy laughs I tend to think that each one gets just enough time on screen to be more than just a one-joke caricature. But I would say that, simply due to the fact that I could watch Dianne Wiest saying "don't speak" on a constant loop (just watch the movie and you'll know what I mean). Warm, witty and full of great actors, I rank this as one of my favourite Woody Allen movies and hope others love it too.

    Woody Allen will always be remembered as a director who could create situations in which characters talk frequently and superbly. In this film, he puts together his spin on life and conversation with the setting of the 1920s Broadway background to create a memorable and sweet film about a group of people that we become so enamored with that they turn out to be more than characters; they become human beings on screen. A terrific cast bolsters this already fine story as we witness a young, idealistic writer/director of the stage (John Cusack) attempt to have his play unscathed by the actors. He soon casts a great Margo Channing-type legend (Dianne Weist), a wacky side-lady (Tracy Ullman), a great actor with an eating fetish and a mobster's girlfriend attempting to break into acting but doesn't quite have the chops. The key to the whole story is the character of the mobster's hit-man, played by Chazz Palmenteri who turns out to be the most theatrically sophisticated and wise of all the characters. Here, Allen shows that genius can come from the most unlikely of sources and also uses it to bring out a number of great comical scenes as well. I guess the best thing to say about this movie is how wonderful Woody Allen's writing is. By this time, he has gotten down the pacing and rhythm so perfectly that it truly is an art-form for him to write screenplays. And, as always in a Woody Allen movie, the actors are terrific and have great fun by playing the parts with gusto and joy. This is a much lighter effort than say, Husbands and Wives or Crimes and Misdemeanors, but it stays in the tradition of Allen able to mix together great dialogue, unique characters and a story that unfolds so easily and delightfully. A treasure unlike any other, Woody Allen creates a fun film one right after the other.

    "Bullets Over Broadway" doesn't work for the same reason other Woody Allen comedies he's written but not starred in don't work. It's very simple, having someone else playing a character that has all the Woody insecurities and mannerisms leaves one wishing for Allen to be playing the part, and feeling cheated that he isn't in the film. Such is the case with John Cusack's playwright character. What you get is a Woody Allen clone that simply can't deliver the comedy intended by Allen. The cast is game, but fine comedians Jennifer Tilly, Jack Warden, and Rob Reiner, don't deliver enough chuckles to overcome the lack of Woody Allen playing the part he obviously was meant to play. - MERK

    Never underestimate Woody Allen's capability to surprise you. The first act "Bullets Over Broadway" didn't put my expectations very high, until an expected little twist in the middle transformed everything and contributed to one of Woody Allen's most fascinating secondary characters. The film opens in the 1928 Broadway, with one cinematic archetype following another. John Cusack is David Shayne, a young playwright. Convinced of his artistic genius, he's your typical struggling newcomer trying to impose his unique style. Not a revolutionary character, Cusack almost replays some mimics of Allen's neurotic writer, only differing physically, with his tall frame canceled by his constantly hunched demeanor, he's handsome enough to make his sex-appeal believable. Although with such a title as "God of Our Fathers", the line between the very talent he claims to have and a sort of pompous pseudo-intellectual vibe is very thin, but we give him the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, Shayne's manager, played by Jack Warden, finds a generous heart accepting to finance the play. Not your typical patron of art, the man is Valenti, a mobster played by the irreplaceable Joe Viterelli. Theater is not his cup of tea but who cares, he's absolutely in love with Olive, his girlfriend, a dancer as ambitious as she's talentless. With her nasal voice, voluptuous forms and misplaced self-satisfaction, Jennifer Tilly revives the performance of Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont in "Singin' in the Rain", with I don't think that was even possible- a much more horrible voice. And no one can even say a word against her, all through the rehearsals, she's chaperoned by a bodyguard named Cheech, one of Viterelli's button-man, more at ease with playing craps and disposing of some bodies, than enduring Shayne's intellectual junk. To go on and on with archetypes, Shayne lives with Ellen, his caring girlfriend, played by Mary Louise Parker, but she lacks the flamboyance and charisma of her soon-to-be rival, Helen Sinclair. Sinclair is the obligatory diva, who played so much plays, worked with so many writers (always the best) that all her characters spill over her mannerisms. If Jennifer Tilly is a dead-on Lina Lamont, Dianne Weist Sinclar is a perfect Norma Desmond, an actress so wrapped up in her ego, she oozes a natural commanding presence, when she orders Shayne 'Don't speak' with a voice as low as possible, he knows it's an act, but still, he has no choice but obeying. Both Tilly and Wiest's performance earned them two deserved Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Wiest won). But had the film only relied on these performances and the great roles of Jim Broadbent and Tracey Ullman, the result would have been a charming little comedy, with no impact whatsoever. To give you an idea, there's a moment when Shayne has a drink with Sinclair, she orders two martinis, in fact the two martinis were for her. The gag is cleverly written, it's funny, but coming from Woody Allen, it didn't have that extra little spice I expected, granted the film is magnificently directed, with costumes and art-directing revisiting the roaring twenties with exuberance, there was not much to hook our hearts on. But then, in the middle of one rehearsal, when the actors and Shayne have an argument about the script, Cheech intervenes. The thug who exuded intimidation and street-smart force, suggests a little revision to the play, and guess what, it works. I knew Chazz Palminteri was Oscar-nominated for this role, I thought he would play in the stage, I thought everything except the fact that he would reveal the genius Shayne obviously lacks. Then the movie took off and turned into a clever and insightful commentary about the meaning of being an artist, creating an oeuvre and being so passionate about it that you wouldn't let anything undermine it, anyone interfere with it. It's about the conflict tormenting a man who tries to be an artist, only to be confronted to another who's genuinely an artist, much more a genius. The romantic subplot involving Shayne and Sinclair takes a whole new importance to the story. When Shayne discusses with his friend Sheldon (Rob Reiner) about it, Sheldon makes one of the most unforgettable statement from any Woody Allen's film: "an artist creates his own moral universe". It seems like an alibi to justify the craziest actions committed by an artist, in fact, it echoes the very actions committed by Cheech, out of love and passion for his work, that will push to the extreme the notion of "moral universe". The brilliance of the script is that Cheech' actions illustrate both what he is and what Shayne is not. And again, Woody Allen is able to transcend usual movie archetypes and illustrate through them the deepest torments invading the heart of artists and wannabe artists. Woody Allen shows the gap between those who got the talent, and those who don't, and he's so talented that he's even able to create a great character who realizes that he doesn't have the talent. The ending of "Bullets Over Broadway" is not the apotheosis we expected, but it's not a downer either. Shayne is finally able to realize what counts for him and what doesn't, it's about knowing oneself and acting in consequence. It's about responsibility, and the level of maturity expressed in the ending is so unexpected it does highlight the hidden genius of the script. And as nothing is gratuitous in a great script, first, its greatness relies on a fascinating contradiction, and I'll never forget the thug with writing genius played by Chazz Palminteri. And even a cute inoffensive gag like Olive not remembering what came after Hamlet's "To be" is a subtle reference to the main conflict of the film. To be an artist or not to be an artist,  to be or not to be, and "Bullets Over Broadway" provides some of the smartest answers to that eternal question.

    Woody Allen successfully combines gangsters and Broadway theater in this riveting comedy that earned seven Academy Award nominations. John Cusack stars in the leading role, doing his best Woody Allen impression of course, as David Shayne, a playwright who has to cast a mobster's girlfriend in one of the starring roles. She is given a body guard named Cheech, played by Chazz Polminteri, who has to sit back and keep an eye on her during rehearsals. As the show starts to come together Cheech has some ideas of his own about the show, and they end up making it a better play than the one David originally wrote. This comedic turn of events fuels the rest of this lively and genuinely funny film. Bullets Over Broadway is simply more of Woody Allen doing what Woody Allen does best. It's quick, witty, whimsical, and intelligently hilarious. It's a great story full of wildly eccentric characters played by an ensemble of great actors. It possesses that engaging Woody Allen cadence full of all the Woody Allen quirkiness that makes us love watching his films. Bullets Over Broadway has a lot of charm and delivers a lot of laughs. There's nothing revolutionary here, but Bullets Over Broadway shows us a great time with all its witticism and frivolous ingenuity. Woody Allen is a pure genius, and he always seems to know exactly what he is doing when he makes a film. His specialty is quirky comedy, so it's no surprise that Bullets Over Broadway is just a great film. The story is simple yet effectively hysterical, and the characters are brilliantly constructed and wonderfully written, each displaying their own quirky uniqueness that becomes part of clever quirky whole. This is a great film, and one that continues to show what a brilliant man Woody Allen is.

    As Woody Allen's MIDNIGHT IN Paris (2011, a 6/10) doesn't impress me much and his latest Italian carol TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) gets horrifying feedbacks, so I fumble around his earlier oeuvre, thanks to his prolific filmography, thus comes BULLETS OVER Broadway (a 7 Oscar nomination receiver in 1994) courtesy of one simple criterion, more often than not, films in which Woody is not starred are much better than in which he is both the director/writer and the actor. I have only watched a handful of Woody's films, but BULLETS OVER Broadway could easily sit in the top row of any years-best list (for me, it just misses my top 10 film in 1994, which is an ultra-competitive year for films, but Cusack, Wiest, Tilly and Palminteri all crack into my top 10 acting rankings). Wiest and Tilly, obtained two Oscar nominations and Wiest was the final winner, who is divinely lofty and my pick as well, she is simply amazing in her delivering of the repetitive "don't speak" lines and the voice warm-up scenes before the final premier. Meanwhile Tilly is plainly acting herself (being slightly amusing and largely annoying), this is an exact example of the disparagement between a bona fide actress and an one-off sensation (Palminteri's Oscar nomination may also belong to be the latter unfortunately), notwithstanding the fact that most acting laborers will never even procure such an opportunity, for instance John Cusack, who is playing Woody Allen in the film and is reliably superb but regrettably snubbed again (after THE GRIFTERS 1990, a 7/10). Speaking of the film, the script has Woody's distinctive bourgeoisie and artist self-mockery in it and the genre mash-up of gangster comedy and a Broadway playwright trapped in his writer's block works adroitly well, although the shooting shots are not Woody's strong suit and the diamond-in-the-rough deployment is over-simplified (maybe there is just no reason beyond it). But on the whole, the witty conversations will always strike a chord if you are an ordinary man with a highbrow heart, and in the final analysis, Diane Wiest alone is worth the time.

    Mr.Cinema aka Woody Allen delivers one of his finest films in 'Bullets Over Broadway', a delicious comedy, that's magnificently written, sharply directed & amazingly performed. Its humorous cinema at its finest hour! 'Bullets Over Broadway' Synopsis: In 1920s New York, a struggling playwright is forced to cast a mobster's talentless girlfriend in his latest drama in order to get it produced. 'Bullets Over Broadway' is a delicious comedy, that's magnificently written by Allen & Douglas McGrath. The characters, the entire set-up is so interesting & funny, that there is hardly a moment when the film falters. Allen's Direction is sharp! Cinematography by Carlo DiPalma is excellent. Editing is good. Performance-Wise: Dianne Wiest won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress & she deserved too. She delivers a career best performance. John Cusack is fantastic. Seriously, why is he so under-rated? Jennifer Tilly is marvelous, while Chazz Palminteri takes an unforgettable turn. Jack Warden is always terrific. Mary-Louise Parker leaves a mark. Tracey Ullman & Jim Broadbent are outstanding. On the whole, 'Bullets Over Broadway' is a must see.

    Woody at his best. A movie about artists - not only about writers ( but mostly about them ), but about any artist, who is trapped between his talent and the expectations that other people have about him. A movie about what it takes to make something perfect. I strongly consider John Cusack's ( David ) character and Chazz Palminteri's ( Cheech ) character as different sides of the same person - the bohemian, who sees in art just an excuse for meeting famous people and living like them and the real artist, for whom art and creating are only reasons to live. And the moral? I guess no one can say it better than David's girlfriend - one could not love an artist if he hasn't got enough dignity to be a man in the first place.

    Because they would take advantage of you with such positive remark. Artists and criminals and their little and complex worlds of being powerful gods, creatures who can create and destroy at the same time. The power of the criminals, gangsters in this case, are the use of his weapons against their enemies or whoever appears on their way; artists like the play writer/director in this film has the power of creativity, words are carefully chosen, scenes and dialogs are marvelously written in order to make the most fantastic creation of all, and the writer has the final word on everything. Well, almost everything. John Cusack's character is a down-on-luck author who finally gets the chance of developing his play in the way he wants, at first by resurrecting the career of diva Helen Sinclair (Dianne Wiest) and selecting his favorite actors. But his luck ends when the play's financier, a mobster (Joe Viterelli) gives the ultimate that his girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly) must have a part on the show, but she has never acted before. The guy gets toyed by this goofy and demanding new actress, by her tough bodyguard (Chazz Palminteri) who'll try to change the play's script, always bothered by the "irrealism" of it; and at last the less negative interference of Sinclair, of whom he madly falls in love with. As the movie progresses we keep asking ourselves: "There's a real chance of this play ever become a hit?" and "How does this writer will ever make his way through fame with such interferences?". While the work of his life gets deconstructed in a turbulence of confusion we keep laughing at all of his drama, or at the other characters eccentric ways of doing things. Outrageously comical "Bullets Over Broadway" is Woody Allen's sound and fury on the power of artistic creations and how they happen, and the way they're developed, constantly changing from what they used to be. Here's a treasure to be admired; it leaves you in a complete state of amazement, a powerful ecstasy. Hilarious situations are wonderfully created, not a single moment is wasted or let down, everything is a feast for our senses from the magnificent casting to the art direction, costumes and cinematography. Allen at his greatest, so enjoy the spectacle! 10/10

    A film so criminally overrated and staggeringly unfunny as to defy description. Allen takes a very promising concept and somehow manages to craft a film that is devoid of hilarity. Idealistic playwright John Cusack finds the backing to mount his play from a gangster. The catch is that in return the gangster's bimbo mistress Jennifer Tilly is to be cast as a psychiatrist in the play. Henchman Chazz Palminteri is dispatched to babysit Tilly and coach her in acting, but in the process makes suggestions to Cusack's play that dramatically improve its quality. This should be hilarious - yet it is not. I don't think I cracked a smile once during the entire course of the film. I have begun to believe that it is utterly impossible for Allen to write genuinely likable or appealing characters - even within the constraints of a broad fable such as this one. Nearly everyone we see on screen is selfish, obnoxious and nasty. Too many scenes are directed as though by chaos. For instance, I lost count of how many scenes start or ended with a group of characters stationed at different points of the set and shrieking their lines at each other, often at the same time, so that the scene is reduced to a wall of incoherent noise. While Allen thankfully delivers us from taking on the leading man duties again, Cusack is simply too bland and uninteresting to hold attention or anchor the action. Tracey Ullman, Mary-Louise Parker and Jim Broadbent are wasted in underwritten roles. Dianne Wiest gets to ham it up as a legendary Broadway diva brought in to headline the show. While she throws herself body and soul into the part, her lampoon of the haughty dowager becomes repetitive. This is a fault of the screenplay more than the actress. She is playing a caricature and one that we have seen done better and funnier in other films. The first time she strikes a pose like Greta Garbo and admonishes Cusack "Don't speak!" is barely amusing.

Palminteri is stuck playing a stereotypical goombah (with the twist that he writes better than Cusack) and Tilly is the quintessential floozy. Both of them hate each - and I mean they really hate each other. Their line readings are loud and shrill and generate all of the charm of a legion of car alarms going off at the same time. There is almost a collective sigh of relief when their scenes conclude and their dialog pretty much goes along the lines of "Why don't you shut up!", "No, you shut up!", "You shut up!", and "You shut up yourself!" Oh, the hilarity. It must have taken Allen all of five minutes to fabricate this winning dialog. By the time the film itself rolls to its unsurprising conclusion, one realizes that you don't care about any of these characters and you want back the time that Allen and his minions have stolen from your life.
