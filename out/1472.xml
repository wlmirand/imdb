    Every character screams and screams and screams in EVERY SCENE! Christain Clavier is just bad as the two characters he's playing. It's not funny at all. It's also quite violent for a comedy film. The film opens with an innocent woman being punched in the face. That was to set the tone that we're in for a rough ride. Another scene where a character is stabbed in the beginning and there's blood everywhere. It's not done in a funny Monty Python and the Holy Grail way either. Also, the character of the wizard is just a waste. He's just there and then he's gone again. I actually liked the remake better despite it's rushed editing and poor timing. That film was not the greatest film in the world, but at least we did't have to listen to people shouting for 90 minutes.

    I've only seen this in the French with English subtitles so I'm sure it loses something in translation but it's still very funny. Jean Reno is a world renowned actor but many of the other actors in this ensemble cast were not known to me before. Valerie Lemercier was particularly good, as was the vassal Christian Clavier. This is humour along the lines of Blackadder & Baldrick, but with a time travel medieval vs modern day France twist. It does highlight the difficultly someone would have coming from the past into the modern day and like similar films the time travellers don't adjust within five minutes so it's far more convincing. It's just funny and I don't find the subtitles a distraction, and everyone's increasing hysteria makes me smile. First time I saw it, it was definitely laugh out loud humour and each time you see it there's definitely something more to see. Recommend you see the French original before the American version. Jean Reno is an awesome actor and he shines in this with comedic timing and genius; it's not many big star actors with such gravitas that will dress up in medieval undergarments and wooing "best" for a role and carry it off with so much aplomb! Funny, very very funny.

    "O-Kayyy!" - one of the many phrases that stick in one's subconscious from this film; more on that shortly As every one else has pointed out, this a time travel film but it is done with such a deftness of touch that it makes some Hollywood offerings look clumsy by comparison. The film is subtitled but the translation have been done with terrific skill. My French is just about up to the dialogue and who-ever did the work has managed to keep the humour throughout. I like the film so much that I even bought a DVD copy of both Les Visiteurs 1 and 2. Returning to "O-Kayyy!" - I was on a very busy Aires de Service in France. I was asked if I wanted the water tap turning off and without thinking shouted the reply of "O-Kayyy!" Two French, One Dutch and one German couple all collapsed with laughter. Later that evening we ran Les Visiteurs 1 on the laptop for them. The result is four friendships that have endured for more than 6 years Yes, Les Visiteurs 1 and 2are truly cinematic greats

    Directed by Jean-Marie Poir&eacute; in 1993, "The Visitors" is without a doubt one of the funniest, most quotable and most emblematic of all French comedies, marking the refreshing come-back of old-school popular cinema, in the same vein than its ancestor "La Grande Vadrouille" and descendant "Asterix: Mission Cl&eacute;opatre". No social commentary, no political correctness, only pure entertainment for both kids and adults, notably carried by the unforgettable buffoonery of Christian Clavier as Jacquouille la Fripouille and his immortal "OK-kay"? Proof that the film doesn't take its comical premise for granted; it takes almost half an hour to build the set-up before the adventure can finally take off. "The Visitors" begins in an extremely convincing historical set-up, in 1123, during a thrilling fight opposing the King Louis VI "the Fat" to his English cousin. The English are defeated thanks to the intervention of Godefroy who saves his king in extremis by decapitating an English fighter; then as a reward for his bravery, Godefroy is made Count of Montmirail and is promised to marry a duke's daughter, Frenegonde de Pouille, played by Val&eacute;rie Lemercier. Victim of a hallucination, he accidentally kills his to-be father in law, as a result, the marriage is canceled. "Only God can resurrect the dead", objects Jacquouille. Yes, but Eusebius, the Wizard, proposes another solution. Time is like a mountain made of underground galleries, and one of his most secret recipes can get Godefroy back to the past, one brief instant before the incident. Naturally, it all goes wrong and both Godefroy and Jacquouille (who had to drink first, 'just in case') are ejected in 1992. After that, the comedic core of "The Visitors" depends on a simple yet realistic promise: any person who'd be accidentally put in another era would not really be like fish in water. Think of Marty McFly in "Back to the Future" who was only thirty years too early: he was naturally seen as a weird guy. Applying the same logic, it's quite understandable that the Count Godefroy the Brave and his servant Jacquouille, who were almost nine centuries too late, would be believed to be insane. And while this is already funny, it's even funnier when they are not, like Jacquouille who lives a tender romance with an exuberant trash trailer, played by his real-life wife, Marie-Anne Chazel. The comparison with "Back to the Future" doesn't end here, like Robert Zemeckis, Jean-Marie Poir&eacute; doesn't take the comical premise of the plot for granted, to let the film go for cheap jokes begging us to laugh. The script is rich in many subplots that enrich the main story, and the performances of all the cast have the perfect dosage of over-the-top mannerisms and realistic behavior. Reno acts very naturally like a real Knight confident about his majesty, while Clavier delivers a magnificent comical performance as Jacquouille, proving that he's the worthy successor of Louis de Funes. Jacquouille la Fripouille has quickly become one of the most memorable characters of French Cinema, something that most comedies tried to achieve in an artificial way, but the public immediately loved Jacquouille, and he's now part of French Pop-Culture. And the performance of Clavier is more impressive because he also plays another prominent character of the film, as the descendant of Jacquouille, the alliteratively named Jacques-Henri Jacquard a snobbish nouveau riche who bought the Montmirail castle. Val&eacute;rie Lemercier also plays another character as the Countess Beatrice, descendant of Godefroy. Only an actress with the talent of Lemercier could have turned such a dull and bland character into an unforgettable caricature of the typical aristocrat woman, but touching in her naivety when she believes Godefroy is her cousin Hubert who mysteriously disappeared after an accidental raid. The film earned her a C&eacute;sar for Best Supporting Actress, while it was nominated for most of the major categories. But nonetheless, it was the most popular French film at that time. And speaking of popularity, that the film made half the success of the more uninspired "Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis" says a lot about the impact of Media buzz and Internet in a movie's success. Had the movie been directed 15 years later, it would have probably dethroned "La Grande Vadrouille" in the French box-office but then again, can you imagine "The Vistors" set in the 2000's, with all the movie conventions it implies: racial political correctness, special-effects overdose and all that stuff or maybe worse: excessive sentimentalism like in "Bievenue Ches les Ch'tis". I have nothing personal against Dany Boon's "Ch'tis" films but the film received so much publicity that at the end, it wasn't successful because it was popular, but quite the opposite. If only it was good enough to be forgivable, but I can't forgive a comedy that ends in an emotional note, when a punch line is required. I remember when the movie came out, it was the phenomenon of the end of the year, everyone was talking about it with so many superlatives that I couldn't believe a movie would be that funny, especially a French one. Well, I saw it on TV the first time and I laughed, my parents laughed, the whole family laughed and never did a slower moment ever change that feeling, there was not even a slow moment, the film was funny from beginning to end, with an exquisite twist at the end, the so-called punch line that cruelly lacked at the end of Dany Boon's film. At the end, the hysterical incomprehension of you-know-who when he finds himself you-know-where was the icing on an already delicious cake served with a magnificent Gothic music. We all laughed to tears, and the fun that never deserted the film is the proof that sometimes the simplest plot premises can make the most hilarious films. I was not in love with the film but with the story and the way everything worked as a set-up for a hilarious conclusion. OK-kay?

    The year is 1123.A knight and his servant are accidentally sent to the year 1992.These medieval people are pretty much like fish out of water in the modern society.Les Visiteurs (1993) is a comedy film directed by Jean-Marie Poir&eacute;.It stars Christian Clavier and Jean Reno.Clavier plays the servant Jacquouille la Fripouille and also his relative of the 90's, Jacquard.Reno plays the part of Godefroy de Papincourt, Comte de Montmirail.Val&eacute;rie Lemercier does a double role playing Godefroy's love interest Fr&eacute;negond&eacute; de Pouille and the descendant Beatrice de Montmirail.Marie-Anne Chazel plays Ginette la Clocharde.Isabelle Nanty is Fabienne Morlot.I borrowed this movie a little while back from the library.I had seen the film once before, back in 1997.I enjoyed watching it the both times.It was a big hit.So big that it got a sequel and an American version.The movie has many funny slapstick moments, like when those two wash their hands in a toilet and when they cause a flood in the house.This is a very nice time travel movie.The Americans have Back to the Future, the French have The Visitors.You can visit this movie more than once.

    *Spoiler/plot- 1993, It's the 10th century, a well known French Medieval knight that saves the French king from the English invaders and is rewarded by being betrothed to a local princess. The French knight and his peasant servant get mixed up with a sorcerer who gives them a potion that puts them into the modern world to see his modern descendants. *Special Stars- Christian Clavier, Jena Reno, Valerie Lemercier, Maire-Anne Chazel, Christian Bjeau, *Theme- Never make an enemy of a sorcerer. *Based on- French Medieval history and popular time travel film plots. *Trivia/location/goofs- French made (English subtitles) Great costumes, and locations around the French countryside. *Emotion- Rather clever time travel comedy movie dealing with great performances from the actors. The cast plays the emotional and dramatic scenes 'dead' serious which only sets up the comedic outcome with a great finish to this film. If you are a history, Renaissance Faire, science fiction, or Francophile buff, this film is pure enjoyment and fun.

    When this was first released, I remember laughing. Then again, I was 9 or 10 at the time. Now, I'm 27 and I understand why my child self (and, indeed, most of the other children) liked in this movie: the sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord of juvenile humour: from farts to pulling faces, random fish-out-of-water gags that long outlast their welcome (the "jour/nuit" gag, in particular, goes on for a tedious length of time), adults yelling and more farts. The fact that the whole cast was greatly overacting would obviously have escaped me; the contrived plot contented me. But no more. They've shown it again a few days ago, and this time, I could see this movie for what it is: tripe. A mouthful proved too much, I couldn't finish it. If you're nine, you might enjoy this. Otherwise, probably not.

    I am not keen to French comedies, maybe a prejudice, whenever in a slapstick comedy, the usual gentle and romantic French sounds a bit vulgar and harsh to me (I don't speak French though), also due to a cultural barrier, my understanding usually is biased or in sheer ignorance of the dialogues or local allusions. There is a common topic why good comedies are always much more difficult to find than decent and touching dramas, suddenly the answer jumped into my mind, which is in most of people's lives, comedic element only occurs sporadically, major quantity of our time is spent in a drama way which we could feel the appeal from the motion pictures, thus, if we encounter a film totally composed of farces and gags, a sense of out of touch from the reality will slowly kill our patience, hence a usual ending is we completely lost all the interest towards the characters in the film provided its jokes and actions fall into clich&eacute; and self- regarded humor. Which is my exact feeling towards the film. I cannot call it a bad film, it entertained me in the first half, then I wished the farce could be ended ASAP (accurately speaking, after the two visitors made a mess in the house of the youngling), Jean Reno's poker face performance is far more enjoyable than Christian Clavier's Joe Pesci-sque monkey business (I cannot squeeze any smile towards him), the last straw is Valerie Lemercier's natural and authentic charm, I cannot believe she was only 29 at that time as I can recall in LITTLE NICHOLAS (2009), she seems to hasn't aged in almost 16 years (a more plausible explanation may be premature senility), I think she is a very qualified comedian.

    I'm french, and i gotta say that i'm really pleased with all the positive comments and feedbacks about this movie, who has become cult in my country. Pretty simple starting idea, making a middle-age knight and his servant time-travel to nowadays, but the result is extremely funny. What i want to say is also that, and many people mentioned it, a huge part of the humor in the movie comes from the mix of the modern french and this old time french language which is extremely funny to hear, cause we (french) aren't used to hear it often. As for the acting, well its amazing : the duo Reno/Clavier just made this movie great, but the supporting characters are also very good (Lemercier, etc ..) A lot of lines in this movie have become famous in my country ("Merci la gueuse ! T'es un laideron mais t'es bien bonne !"), and just by reminding of this movie, i'm laughing out loud, alone in front of my screen :D One of the best french comedy ever.

    The year is 1123.A knight and his servant are accidentally sent to the year 1992.These medieval people are pretty much like fish out of water in the modern society.Les Visiteurs (1993) is a comedy film directed by Jean-Marie Poir&eacute;.It stars Christian Clavier and Jean Reno.Clavier plays the servant Jacquouille la Fripouille and also his relative of the 90's, Jacquard.Reno plays the part of Godefroy de Papincourt, Comte de Montmirail.Val&eacute;rie Lemercier does a double role playing Godefroy's love interest Fr&eacute;negond&eacute; de Pouille and the descendant Beatrice de Montmirail.Marie-Anne Chazel plays Ginette la Clocharde.Isabelle Nanty is Fabienne Morlot.I borrowed this movie a little while back from the library.I had seen the film once before, back in 1997.I enjoyed watching it the both times.It was a big hit.So big that it got a sequel and an American version.The movie has many funny slapstick moments, like when those two wash their hands in a toilet and when they cause a flood in the house.This is a very nice time travel movie.The Americans have Back to the Future, the French have The Visitors.You can visit this movie more than once.

    When this was first released, I remember laughing. Then again, I was 9 or 10 at the time. Now, I'm 27 and I understand why my child self (and, indeed, most of the other children) liked in this movie: the sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord of juvenile humour: from farts to pulling faces, random fish-out-of-water gags that long outlast their welcome (the "jour/nuit" gag, in particular, goes on for a tedious length of time), adults yelling and more farts. The fact that the whole cast was greatly overacting would obviously have escaped me; the contrived plot contented me. But no more. They've shown it again a few days ago, and this time, I could see this movie for what it is: tripe. A mouthful proved too much, I couldn't finish it. If you're nine, you might enjoy this. Otherwise, probably not.

    I am not keen to French comedies, maybe a prejudice, whenever in a slapstick comedy, the usual gentle and romantic French sounds a bit vulgar and harsh to me (I don't speak French though), also due to a cultural barrier, my understanding usually is biased or in sheer ignorance of the dialogues or local allusions. There is a common topic why good comedies are always much more difficult to find than decent and touching dramas, suddenly the answer jumped into my mind, which is in most of people's lives, comedic element only occurs sporadically, major quantity of our time is spent in a drama way which we could feel the appeal from the motion pictures, thus, if we encounter a film totally composed of farces and gags, a sense of out of touch from the reality will slowly kill our patience, hence a usual ending is we completely lost all the interest towards the characters in the film provided its jokes and actions fall into clich&eacute; and self- regarded humor. Which is my exact feeling towards the film. I cannot call it a bad film, it entertained me in the first half, then I wished the farce could be ended ASAP (accurately speaking, after the two visitors made a mess in the house of the youngling), Jean Reno's poker face performance is far more enjoyable than Christian Clavier's Joe Pesci-sque monkey business (I cannot squeeze any smile towards him), the last straw is Valerie Lemercier's natural and authentic charm, I cannot believe she was only 29 at that time as I can recall in LITTLE NICHOLAS (2009), she seems to hasn't aged in almost 16 years (a more plausible explanation may be premature senility), I think she is a very qualified comedian.

    I'm french, and i gotta say that i'm really pleased with all the positive comments and feedbacks about this movie, who has become cult in my country. Pretty simple starting idea, making a middle-age knight and his servant time-travel to nowadays, but the result is extremely funny. What i want to say is also that, and many people mentioned it, a huge part of the humor in the movie comes from the mix of the modern french and this old time french language which is extremely funny to hear, cause we (french) aren't used to hear it often. As for the acting, well its amazing : the duo Reno/Clavier just made this movie great, but the supporting characters are also very good (Lemercier, etc ..) A lot of lines in this movie have become famous in my country ("Merci la gueuse ! T'es un laideron mais t'es bien bonne !"), and just by reminding of this movie, i'm laughing out loud, alone in front of my screen :D One of the best french comedy ever.

    Every character screams and screams and screams in EVERY SCENE! Christain Clavier is just bad as the two characters he's playing. It's not funny at all. It's also quite violent for a comedy film. The film opens with an innocent woman being punched in the face. That was to set the tone that we're in for a rough ride. Another scene where a character is stabbed in the beginning and there's blood everywhere. It's not done in a funny Monty Python and the Holy Grail way either. Also, the character of the wizard is just a waste. He's just there and then he's gone again. I actually liked the remake better despite it's rushed editing and poor timing. That film was not the greatest film in the world, but at least we did't have to listen to people shouting for 90 minutes.

    I've only seen this in the French with English subtitles so I'm sure it loses something in translation but it's still very funny. Jean Reno is a world renowned actor but many of the other actors in this ensemble cast were not known to me before. Valerie Lemercier was particularly good, as was the vassal Christian Clavier. This is humour along the lines of Blackadder & Baldrick, but with a time travel medieval vs modern day France twist. It does highlight the difficultly someone would have coming from the past into the modern day and like similar films the time travellers don't adjust within five minutes so it's far more convincing. It's just funny and I don't find the subtitles a distraction, and everyone's increasing hysteria makes me smile. First time I saw it, it was definitely laugh out loud humour and each time you see it there's definitely something more to see. Recommend you see the French original before the American version. Jean Reno is an awesome actor and he shines in this with comedic timing and genius; it's not many big star actors with such gravitas that will dress up in medieval undergarments and wooing "best" for a role and carry it off with so much aplomb! Funny, very very funny.

    "O-Kayyy!" - one of the many phrases that stick in one's subconscious from this film; more on that shortly As every one else has pointed out, this a time travel film but it is done with such a deftness of touch that it makes some Hollywood offerings look clumsy by comparison. The film is subtitled but the translation have been done with terrific skill. My French is just about up to the dialogue and who-ever did the work has managed to keep the humour throughout. I like the film so much that I even bought a DVD copy of both Les Visiteurs 1 and 2. Returning to "O-Kayyy!" - I was on a very busy Aires de Service in France. I was asked if I wanted the water tap turning off and without thinking shouted the reply of "O-Kayyy!" Two French, One Dutch and one German couple all collapsed with laughter. Later that evening we ran Les Visiteurs 1 on the laptop for them. The result is four friendships that have endured for more than 6 years Yes, Les Visiteurs 1 and 2are truly cinematic greats

    Directed by Jean-Marie Poir&eacute; in 1993, "The Visitors" is without a doubt one of the funniest, most quotable and most emblematic of all French comedies, marking the refreshing come-back of old-school popular cinema, in the same vein than its ancestor "La Grande Vadrouille" and descendant "Asterix: Mission Cl&eacute;opatre". No social commentary, no political correctness, only pure entertainment for both kids and adults, notably carried by the unforgettable buffoonery of Christian Clavier as Jacquouille la Fripouille and his immortal "OK-kay"? Proof that the film doesn't take its comical premise for granted; it takes almost half an hour to build the set-up before the adventure can finally take off. "The Visitors" begins in an extremely convincing historical set-up, in 1123, during a thrilling fight opposing the King Louis VI "the Fat" to his English cousin. The English are defeated thanks to the intervention of Godefroy who saves his king in extremis by decapitating an English fighter; then as a reward for his bravery, Godefroy is made Count of Montmirail and is promised to marry a duke's daughter, Frenegonde de Pouille, played by Val&eacute;rie Lemercier. Victim of a hallucination, he accidentally kills his to-be father in law, as a result, the marriage is canceled. "Only God can resurrect the dead", objects Jacquouille. Yes, but Eusebius, the Wizard, proposes another solution. Time is like a mountain made of underground galleries, and one of his most secret recipes can get Godefroy back to the past, one brief instant before the incident. Naturally, it all goes wrong and both Godefroy and Jacquouille (who had to drink first, 'just in case') are ejected in 1992. After that, the comedic core of "The Visitors" depends on a simple yet realistic promise: any person who'd be accidentally put in another era would not really be like fish in water. Think of Marty McFly in "Back to the Future" who was only thirty years too early: he was naturally seen as a weird guy. Applying the same logic, it's quite understandable that the Count Godefroy the Brave and his servant Jacquouille, who were almost nine centuries too late, would be believed to be insane. And while this is already funny, it's even funnier when they are not, like Jacquouille who lives a tender romance with an exuberant trash trailer, played by his real-life wife, Marie-Anne Chazel. The comparison with "Back to the Future" doesn't end here, like Robert Zemeckis, Jean-Marie Poir&eacute; doesn't take the comical premise of the plot for granted, to let the film go for cheap jokes begging us to laugh. The script is rich in many subplots that enrich the main story, and the performances of all the cast have the perfect dosage of over-the-top mannerisms and realistic behavior. Reno acts very naturally like a real Knight confident about his majesty, while Clavier delivers a magnificent comical performance as Jacquouille, proving that he's the worthy successor of Louis de Funes. Jacquouille la Fripouille has quickly become one of the most memorable characters of French Cinema, something that most comedies tried to achieve in an artificial way, but the public immediately loved Jacquouille, and he's now part of French Pop-Culture. And the performance of Clavier is more impressive because he also plays another prominent character of the film, as the descendant of Jacquouille, the alliteratively named Jacques-Henri Jacquard a snobbish nouveau riche who bought the Montmirail castle. Val&eacute;rie Lemercier also plays another character as the Countess Beatrice, descendant of Godefroy. Only an actress with the talent of Lemercier could have turned such a dull and bland character into an unforgettable caricature of the typical aristocrat woman, but touching in her naivety when she believes Godefroy is her cousin Hubert who mysteriously disappeared after an accidental raid. The film earned her a C&eacute;sar for Best Supporting Actress, while it was nominated for most of the major categories. But nonetheless, it was the most popular French film at that time. And speaking of popularity, that the film made half the success of the more uninspired "Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis" says a lot about the impact of Media buzz and Internet in a movie's success. Had the movie been directed 15 years later, it would have probably dethroned "La Grande Vadrouille" in the French box-office but then again, can you imagine "The Vistors" set in the 2000's, with all the movie conventions it implies: racial political correctness, special-effects overdose and all that stuff or maybe worse: excessive sentimentalism like in "Bievenue Ches les Ch'tis". I have nothing personal against Dany Boon's "Ch'tis" films but the film received so much publicity that at the end, it wasn't successful because it was popular, but quite the opposite. If only it was good enough to be forgivable, but I can't forgive a comedy that ends in an emotional note, when a punch line is required. I remember when the movie came out, it was the phenomenon of the end of the year, everyone was talking about it with so many superlatives that I couldn't believe a movie would be that funny, especially a French one. Well, I saw it on TV the first time and I laughed, my parents laughed, the whole family laughed and never did a slower moment ever change that feeling, there was not even a slow moment, the film was funny from beginning to end, with an exquisite twist at the end, the so-called punch line that cruelly lacked at the end of Dany Boon's film. At the end, the hysterical incomprehension of you-know-who when he finds himself you-know-where was the icing on an already delicious cake served with a magnificent Gothic music. We all laughed to tears, and the fun that never deserted the film is the proof that sometimes the simplest plot premises can make the most hilarious films. I was not in love with the film but with the story and the way everything worked as a set-up for a hilarious conclusion. OK-kay?

Victim of a hallucination, he accidentally kills his to-be father in law, as a result, the marriage is canceled. "Only God can resurrect the dead", objects Jacquouille. Yes, but Eusebius, the Wizard, proposes another solution. Time is like a mountain made of underground galleries, and one of his most secret recipes can get Godefroy back to the past, one brief instant before the incident. Naturally, it all goes wrong and both Godefroy and Jacquouille (who had to drink first, 'just in case') are ejected in 1992. After that, the comedic core of "The Visitors" depends on a simple yet realistic promise: any person who'd be accidentally put in another era would not really be like fish in water. Think of Marty McFly in "Back to the Future" who was only thirty years too early: he was naturally seen as a weird guy. Applying the same logic, it's quite understandable that the Count Godefroy the Brave and his servant Jacquouille, who were almost nine centuries too late, would be believed to be insane. And while this is already funny, it's even funnier when they are not, like Jacquouille who lives a tender romance with an exuberant trash trailer, played by his real-life wife, Marie-Anne Chazel. The comparison with "Back to the Future" doesn't end here, like Robert Zemeckis, Jean-Marie Poir&eacute; doesn't take the comical premise of the plot for granted, to let the film go for cheap jokes begging us to laugh. The script is rich in many subplots that enrich the main story, and the performances of all the cast have the perfect dosage of over-the-top mannerisms and realistic behavior. Reno acts very naturally like a real Knight confident about his majesty, while Clavier delivers a magnificent comical performance as Jacquouille, proving that he's the worthy successor of Louis de Funes. Jacquouille la Fripouille has quickly become one of the most memorable characters of French Cinema, something that most comedies tried to achieve in an artificial way, but the public immediately loved Jacquouille, and he's now part of French Pop-Culture. And the performance of Clavier is more impressive because he also plays another prominent character of the film, as the descendant of Jacquouille, the alliteratively named Jacques-Henri Jacquard a snobbish nouveau riche who bought the Montmirail castle. Val&eacute;rie Lemercier also plays another character as the Countess Beatrice, descendant of Godefroy. Only an actress with the talent of Lemercier could have turned such a dull and bland character into an unforgettable caricature of the typical aristocrat woman, but touching in her naivety when she believes Godefroy is her cousin Hubert who mysteriously disappeared after an accidental raid. The film earned her a C&eacute;sar for Best Supporting Actress, while it was nominated for most of the major categories. But nonetheless, it was the most popular French film at that time. And speaking of popularity, that the film made half the success of the more uninspired "Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis" says a lot about the impact of Media buzz and Internet in a movie's success. Had the movie been directed 15 years later, it would have probably dethroned "La Grande Vadrouille" in the French box-office but then again, can you imagine "The Vistors" set in the 2000's, with all the movie conventions it implies: racial political correctness, special-effects overdose and all that stuff or maybe worse: excessive sentimentalism like in "Bievenue Ches les Ch'tis". I have nothing personal against Dany Boon's "Ch'tis" films but the film received so much publicity that at the end, it wasn't successful because it was popular, but quite the opposite. If only it was good enough to be forgivable, but I can't forgive a comedy that ends in an emotional note, when a punch line is required. I remember when the movie came out, it was the phenomenon of the end of the year, everyone was talking about it with so many superlatives that I couldn't believe a movie would be that funny, especially a French one. Well, I saw it on TV the first time and I laughed, my parents laughed, the whole family laughed and never did a slower moment ever change that feeling, there was not even a slow moment, the film was funny from beginning to end, with an exquisite twist at the end, the so-called punch line that cruelly lacked at the end of Dany Boon's film. At the end, the hysterical incomprehension of you-know-who when he finds himself you-know-where was the icing on an already delicious cake served with a magnificent Gothic music. We all laughed to tears, and the fun that never deserted the film is the proof that sometimes the simplest plot premises can make the most hilarious films. I was not in love with the film but with the story and the way everything worked as a set-up for a hilarious conclusion. OK-kay?

    When this was first released, I remember laughing. Then again, I was 9 or 10 at the time. Now, I'm 27 and I understand why my child self (and, indeed, most of the other children) liked in this movie: the sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord of juvenile humour: from farts to pulling faces, random fish-out-of-water gags that long outlast their welcome (the "jour/nuit" gag, in particular, goes on for a tedious length of time), adults yelling and more farts. The fact that the whole cast was greatly overacting would obviously have escaped me; the contrived plot contented me. But no more. They've shown it again a few days ago, and this time, I could see this movie for what it is: tripe. A mouthful proved too much, I couldn't finish it. If you're nine, you might enjoy this. Otherwise, probably not.

    I am not keen to French comedies, maybe a prejudice, whenever in a slapstick comedy, the usual gentle and romantic French sounds a bit vulgar and harsh to me (I don't speak French though), also due to a cultural barrier, my understanding usually is biased or in sheer ignorance of the dialogues or local allusions. There is a common topic why good comedies are always much more difficult to find than decent and touching dramas, suddenly the answer jumped into my mind, which is in most of people's lives, comedic element only occurs sporadically, major quantity of our time is spent in a drama way which we could feel the appeal from the motion pictures, thus, if we encounter a film totally composed of farces and gags, a sense of out of touch from the reality will slowly kill our patience, hence a usual ending is we completely lost all the interest towards the characters in the film provided its jokes and actions fall into clich&eacute; and self- regarded humor. Which is my exact feeling towards the film. I cannot call it a bad film, it entertained me in the first half, then I wished the farce could be ended ASAP (accurately speaking, after the two visitors made a mess in the house of the youngling), Jean Reno's poker face performance is far more enjoyable than Christian Clavier's Joe Pesci-sque monkey business (I cannot squeeze any smile towards him), the last straw is Valerie Lemercier's natural and authentic charm, I cannot believe she was only 29 at that time as I can recall in LITTLE NICHOLAS (2009), she seems to hasn't aged in almost 16 years (a more plausible explanation may be premature senility), I think she is a very qualified comedian.

    I'm french, and i gotta say that i'm really pleased with all the positive comments and feedbacks about this movie, who has become cult in my country. Pretty simple starting idea, making a middle-age knight and his servant time-travel to nowadays, but the result is extremely funny. What i want to say is also that, and many people mentioned it, a huge part of the humor in the movie comes from the mix of the modern french and this old time french language which is extremely funny to hear, cause we (french) aren't used to hear it often. As for the acting, well its amazing : the duo Reno/Clavier just made this movie great, but the supporting characters are also very good (Lemercier, etc ..) A lot of lines in this movie have become famous in my country ("Merci la gueuse ! T'es un laideron mais t'es bien bonne !"), and just by reminding of this movie, i'm laughing out loud, alone in front of my screen :D One of the best french comedy ever.

    Every character screams and screams and screams in EVERY SCENE! Christain Clavier is just bad as the two characters he's playing. It's not funny at all. It's also quite violent for a comedy film. The film opens with an innocent woman being punched in the face. That was to set the tone that we're in for a rough ride. Another scene where a character is stabbed in the beginning and there's blood everywhere. It's not done in a funny Monty Python and the Holy Grail way either. Also, the character of the wizard is just a waste. He's just there and then he's gone again. I actually liked the remake better despite it's rushed editing and poor timing. That film was not the greatest film in the world, but at least we did't have to listen to people shouting for 90 minutes.

    I've only seen this in the French with English subtitles so I'm sure it loses something in translation but it's still very funny. Jean Reno is a world renowned actor but many of the other actors in this ensemble cast were not known to me before. Valerie Lemercier was particularly good, as was the vassal Christian Clavier. This is humour along the lines of Blackadder & Baldrick, but with a time travel medieval vs modern day France twist. It does highlight the difficultly someone would have coming from the past into the modern day and like similar films the time travellers don't adjust within five minutes so it's far more convincing. It's just funny and I don't find the subtitles a distraction, and everyone's increasing hysteria makes me smile. First time I saw it, it was definitely laugh out loud humour and each time you see it there's definitely something more to see. Recommend you see the French original before the American version. Jean Reno is an awesome actor and he shines in this with comedic timing and genius; it's not many big star actors with such gravitas that will dress up in medieval undergarments and wooing "best" for a role and carry it off with so much aplomb! Funny, very very funny.

    "O-Kayyy!" - one of the many phrases that stick in one's subconscious from this film; more on that shortly As every one else has pointed out, this a time travel film but it is done with such a deftness of touch that it makes some Hollywood offerings look clumsy by comparison. The film is subtitled but the translation have been done with terrific skill. My French is just about up to the dialogue and who-ever did the work has managed to keep the humour throughout. I like the film so much that I even bought a DVD copy of both Les Visiteurs 1 and 2. Returning to "O-Kayyy!" - I was on a very busy Aires de Service in France. I was asked if I wanted the water tap turning off and without thinking shouted the reply of "O-Kayyy!" Two French, One Dutch and one German couple all collapsed with laughter. Later that evening we ran Les Visiteurs 1 on the laptop for them. The result is four friendships that have endured for more than 6 years Yes, Les Visiteurs 1 and 2are truly cinematic greats

    Directed by Jean-Marie Poir&eacute; in 1993, "The Visitors" is without a doubt one of the funniest, most quotable and most emblematic of all French comedies, marking the refreshing come-back of old-school popular cinema, in the same vein than its ancestor "La Grande Vadrouille" and descendant "Asterix: Mission Cl&eacute;opatre". No social commentary, no political correctness, only pure entertainment for both kids and adults, notably carried by the unforgettable buffoonery of Christian Clavier as Jacquouille la Fripouille and his immortal "OK-kay"? Proof that the film doesn't take its comical premise for granted; it takes almost half an hour to build the set-up before the adventure can finally take off. "The Visitors" begins in an extremely convincing historical set-up, in 1123, during a thrilling fight opposing the King Louis VI "the Fat" to his English cousin. The English are defeated thanks to the intervention of Godefroy who saves his king in extremis by decapitating an English fighter; then as a reward for his bravery, Godefroy is made Count of Montmirail and is promised to marry a duke's daughter, Frenegonde de Pouille, played by Val&eacute;rie Lemercier. Victim of a hallucination, he accidentally kills his to-be father in law, as a result, the marriage is canceled. "Only God can resurrect the dead", objects Jacquouille. Yes, but Eusebius, the Wizard, proposes another solution. Time is like a mountain made of underground galleries, and one of his most secret recipes can get Godefroy back to the past, one brief instant before the incident. Naturally, it all goes wrong and both Godefroy and Jacquouille (who had to drink first, 'just in case') are ejected in 1992. After that, the comedic core of "The Visitors" depends on a simple yet realistic promise: any person who'd be accidentally put in another era would not really be like fish in water. Think of Marty McFly in "Back to the Future" who was only thirty years too early: he was naturally seen as a weird guy.

    I've only seen this in the French with English subtitles so I'm sure it loses something in translation but it's still very funny. Jean Reno is a world renowned actor but many of the other actors in this ensemble cast were not known to me before. Valerie Lemercier was particularly good, as was the vassal Christian Clavier. This is humour along the lines of Blackadder & Baldrick, but with a time travel medieval vs modern day France twist. It does highlight the difficultly someone would have coming from the past into the modern day and like similar films the time travellers don't adjust within five minutes so it's far more convincing. It's just funny and I don't find the subtitles a distraction, and everyone's increasing hysteria makes me smile. First time I saw it, it was definitely laugh out loud humour and each time you see it there's definitely something more to see. Recommend you see the French original before the American version. Jean Reno is an awesome actor and he shines in this with comedic timing and genius; it's not many big star actors with such gravitas that will dress up in medieval undergarments and wooing "best" for a role and carry it off with so much aplomb! Funny, very very funny.

    "O-Kayyy!" - one of the many phrases that stick in one's subconscious from this film; more on that shortly As every one else has pointed out, this a time travel film but it is done with such a deftness of touch that it makes some Hollywood offerings look clumsy by comparison. The film is subtitled but the translation have been done with terrific skill. My French is just about up to the dialogue and who-ever did the work has managed to keep the humour throughout. I like the film so much that I even bought a DVD copy of both Les Visiteurs 1 and 2. Returning to "O-Kayyy!" - I was on a very busy Aires de Service in France. I was asked if I wanted the water tap turning off and without thinking shouted the reply of "O-Kayyy!" Two French, One Dutch and one German couple all collapsed with laughter. Later that evening we ran Les Visiteurs 1 on the laptop for them. The result is four friendships that have endured for more than 6 years Yes, Les Visiteurs 1 and 2are truly cinematic greats

    Directed by Jean-Marie Poir&eacute; in 1993, "The Visitors" is without a doubt one of the funniest, most quotable and most emblematic of all French comedies, marking the refreshing come-back of old-school popular cinema, in the same vein than its ancestor "La Grande Vadrouille" and descendant "Asterix: Mission Cl&eacute;opatre". No social commentary, no political correctness, only pure entertainment for both kids and adults, notably carried by the unforgettable buffoonery of Christian Clavier as Jacquouille la Fripouille and his immortal "OK-kay"? Proof that the film doesn't take its comical premise for granted; it takes almost half an hour to build the set-up before the adventure can finally take off. "The Visitors" begins in an extremely convincing historical set-up, in 1123, during a thrilling fight opposing the King Louis VI "the Fat" to his English cousin. The English are defeated thanks to the intervention of Godefroy who saves his king in extremis by decapitating an English fighter; then as a reward for his bravery, Godefroy is made Count of Montmirail and is promised to marry a duke's daughter, Frenegonde de Pouille, played by Val&eacute;rie Lemercier. Victim of a hallucination, he accidentally kills his to-be father in law, as a result, the marriage is canceled. "Only God can resurrect the dead", objects Jacquouille. Yes, but Eusebius, the Wizard, proposes another solution. Time is like a mountain made of underground galleries, and one of his most secret recipes can get Godefroy back to the past, one brief instant before the incident. Naturally, it all goes wrong and both Godefroy and Jacquouille (who had to drink first, 'just in case') are ejected in 1992. After that, the comedic core of "The Visitors" depends on a simple yet realistic promise: any person who'd be accidentally put in another era would not really be like fish in water. Think of Marty McFly in "Back to the Future" who was only thirty years too early: he was naturally seen as a weird guy. Applying the same logic, it's quite understandable that the Count Godefroy the Brave and his servant Jacquouille, who were almost nine centuries too late, would be believed to be insane. And while this is already funny, it's even funnier when they are not, like Jacquouille who lives a tender romance with an exuberant trash trailer, played by his real-life wife, Marie-Anne Chazel. The comparison with "Back to the Future" doesn't end here, like Robert Zemeckis, Jean-Marie Poir&eacute; doesn't take the comical premise of the plot for granted, to let the film go for cheap jokes begging us to laugh. The script is rich in many subplots that enrich the main story, and the performances of all the cast have the perfect dosage of over-the-top mannerisms and realistic behavior. Reno acts very naturally like a real Knight confident about his majesty, while Clavier delivers a magnificent comical performance as Jacquouille, proving that he's the worthy successor of Louis de Funes. Jacquouille la Fripouille has quickly become one of the most memorable characters of French Cinema, something that most comedies tried to achieve in an artificial way, but the public immediately loved Jacquouille, and he's now part of French Pop-Culture. And the performance of Clavier is more impressive because he also plays another prominent character of the film, as the descendant of Jacquouille, the alliteratively named Jacques-Henri Jacquard a snobbish nouveau riche who bought the Montmirail castle. Val&eacute;rie Lemercier also plays another character as the Countess Beatrice, descendant of Godefroy. Only an actress with the talent of Lemercier could have turned such a dull and bland character into an unforgettable caricature of the typical aristocrat woman, but touching in her naivety when she believes Godefroy is her cousin Hubert who mysteriously disappeared after an accidental raid. The film earned her a C&eacute;sar for Best Supporting Actress, while it was nominated for most of the major categories. But nonetheless, it was the most popular French film at that time. And speaking of popularity, that the film made half the success of the more uninspired "Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis" says a lot about the impact of Media buzz and Internet in a movie's success. Had the movie been directed 15 years later, it would have probably dethroned "La Grande Vadrouille" in the French box-office but then again, can you imagine "The Vistors" set in the 2000's, with all the movie conventions it implies: racial political correctness, special-effects overdose and all that stuff or maybe worse: excessive sentimentalism like in "Bievenue Ches les Ch'tis". I have nothing personal against Dany Boon's "Ch'tis" films but the film received so much publicity that at the end, it wasn't successful because it was popular, but quite the opposite. If only it was good enough to be forgivable, but I can't forgive a comedy that ends in an emotional note, when a punch line is required. I remember when the movie came out, it was the phenomenon of the end of the year, everyone was talking about it with so many superlatives that I couldn't believe a movie would be that funny, especially a French one. Well, I saw it on TV the first time and I laughed, my parents laughed, the whole family laughed and never did a slower moment ever change that feeling, there was not even a slow moment, the film was funny from beginning to end, with an exquisite twist at the end, the so-called punch line that cruelly lacked at the end of Dany Boon's film. At the end, the hysterical incomprehension of you-know-who when he finds himself you-know-where was the icing on an already delicious cake served with a magnificent Gothic music. We all laughed to tears, and the fun that never deserted the film is the proof that sometimes the simplest plot premises can make the most hilarious films. I was not in love with the film but with the story and the way everything worked as a set-up for a hilarious conclusion. OK-kay?

    *Spoiler/plot- 1993, It's the 10th century, a well known French Medieval knight that saves the French king from the English invaders and is rewarded by being betrothed to a local princess. The French knight and his peasant servant get mixed up with a sorcerer who gives them a potion that puts them into the modern world to see his modern descendants. *Special Stars- Christian Clavier, Jena Reno, Valerie Lemercier, Maire-Anne Chazel, Christian Bjeau, *Theme- Never make an enemy of a sorcerer. *Based on- French Medieval history and popular time travel film plots. *Trivia/location/goofs- French made (English subtitles) Great costumes, and locations around the French countryside. *Emotion- Rather clever time travel comedy movie dealing with great performances from the actors. The cast plays the emotional and dramatic scenes 'dead' serious which only sets up the comedic outcome with a great finish to this film. If you are a history, Renaissance Faire, science fiction, or Francophile buff, this film is pure enjoyment and fun.

    When this was first released, I remember laughing. Then again, I was 9 or 10 at the time. Now, I'm 27 and I understand why my child self (and, indeed, most of the other children) liked in this movie: the sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord of juvenile humour: from farts to pulling faces, random fish-out-of-water gags that long outlast their welcome (the "jour/nuit" gag, in particular, goes on for a tedious length of time), adults yelling and more farts. The fact that the whole cast was greatly overacting would obviously have escaped me; the contrived plot contented me. But no more. They've shown it again a few days ago, and this time, I could see this movie for what it is: tripe. A mouthful proved too much, I couldn't finish it. If you're nine, you might enjoy this. Otherwise, probably not.

    I am not keen to French comedies, maybe a prejudice, whenever in a slapstick comedy, the usual gentle and romantic French sounds a bit vulgar and harsh to me (I don't speak French though), also due to a cultural barrier, my understanding usually is biased or in sheer ignorance of the dialogues or local allusions. There is a common topic why good comedies are always much more difficult to find than decent and touching dramas, suddenly the answer jumped into my mind, which is in most of people's lives, comedic element only occurs sporadically, major quantity of our time is spent in a drama way which we could feel the appeal from the motion pictures, thus, if we encounter a film totally composed of farces and gags, a sense of out of touch from the reality will slowly kill our patience, hence a usual ending is we completely lost all the interest towards the characters in the film provided its jokes and actions fall into clich&eacute; and self- regarded humor. Which is my exact feeling towards the film. I cannot call it a bad film, it entertained me in the first half, then I wished the farce could be ended ASAP (accurately speaking, after the two visitors made a mess in the house of the youngling), Jean Reno's poker face performance is far more enjoyable than Christian Clavier's Joe Pesci-sque monkey business (I cannot squeeze any smile towards him), the last straw is Valerie Lemercier's natural and authentic charm, I cannot believe she was only 29 at that time as I can recall in LITTLE NICHOLAS (2009), she seems to hasn't aged in almost 16 years (a more plausible explanation may be premature senility), I think she is a very qualified comedian.

    I'm french, and i gotta say that i'm really pleased with all the positive comments and feedbacks about this movie, who has become cult in my country. Pretty simple starting idea, making a middle-age knight and his servant time-travel to nowadays, but the result is extremely funny. What i want to say is also that, and many people mentioned it, a huge part of the humor in the movie comes from the mix of the modern french and this old time french language which is extremely funny to hear, cause we (french) aren't used to hear it often. As for the acting, well its amazing : the duo Reno/Clavier just made this movie great, but the supporting characters are also very good (Lemercier, etc ..) A lot of lines in this movie have become famous in my country ("Merci la gueuse ! T'es un laideron mais t'es bien bonne !"), and just by reminding of this movie, i'm laughing out loud, alone in front of my screen :D One of the best french comedy ever.

    Every character screams and screams and screams in EVERY SCENE! Christain Clavier is just bad as the two characters he's playing. It's not funny at all. It's also quite violent for a comedy film. The film opens with an innocent woman being punched in the face. That was to set the tone that we're in for a rough ride. Another scene where a character is stabbed in the beginning and there's blood everywhere. It's not done in a funny Monty Python and the Holy Grail way either. Also, the character of the wizard is just a waste. He's just there and then he's gone again. I actually liked the remake better despite it's rushed editing and poor timing. That film was not the greatest film in the world, but at least we did't have to listen to people shouting for 90 minutes.

They've shown it again a few days ago, and this time, I could see this movie for what it is: tripe. A mouthful proved too much, I couldn't finish it. If you're nine, you might enjoy this. Otherwise, probably not.

    I am not keen to French comedies, maybe a prejudice, whenever in a slapstick comedy, the usual gentle and romantic French sounds a bit vulgar and harsh to me (I don't speak French though), also due to a cultural barrier, my understanding usually is biased or in sheer ignorance of the dialogues or local allusions. There is a common topic why good comedies are always much more difficult to find than decent and touching dramas, suddenly the answer jumped into my mind, which is in most of people's lives, comedic element only occurs sporadically, major quantity of our time is spent in a drama way which we could feel the appeal from the motion pictures, thus, if we encounter a film totally composed of farces and gags, a sense of out of touch from the reality will slowly kill our patience, hence a usual ending is we completely lost all the interest towards the characters in the film provided its jokes and actions fall into clich&eacute; and self- regarded humor. Which is my exact feeling towards the film. I cannot call it a bad film, it entertained me in the first half, then I wished the farce could be ended ASAP (accurately speaking, after the two visitors made a mess in the house of the youngling), Jean Reno's poker face performance is far more enjoyable than Christian Clavier's Joe Pesci-sque monkey business (I cannot squeeze any smile towards him), the last straw is Valerie Lemercier's natural and authentic charm, I cannot believe she was only 29 at that time as I can recall in LITTLE NICHOLAS (2009), she seems to hasn't aged in almost 16 years (a more plausible explanation may be premature senility), I think she is a very qualified comedian.

    I'm french, and i gotta say that i'm really pleased with all the positive comments and feedbacks about this movie, who has become cult in my country. Pretty simple starting idea, making a middle-age knight and his servant time-travel to nowadays, but the result is extremely funny. What i want to say is also that, and many people mentioned it, a huge part of the humor in the movie comes from the mix of the modern french and this old time french language which is extremely funny to hear, cause we (french) aren't used to hear it often. As for the acting, well its amazing : the duo Reno/Clavier just made this movie great, but the supporting characters are also very good (Lemercier, etc ..) A lot of lines in this movie have become famous in my country ("Merci la gueuse ! T'es un laideron mais t'es bien bonne !"), and just by reminding of this movie, i'm laughing out loud, alone in front of my screen :D One of the best french comedy ever.

    Every character screams and screams and screams in EVERY SCENE! Christain Clavier is just bad as the two characters he's playing. It's not funny at all. It's also quite violent for a comedy film. The film opens with an innocent woman being punched in the face. That was to set the tone that we're in for a rough ride. Another scene where a character is stabbed in the beginning and there's blood everywhere. It's not done in a funny Monty Python and the Holy Grail way either. Also, the character of the wizard is just a waste. He's just there and then he's gone again. I actually liked the remake better despite it's rushed editing and poor timing. That film was not the greatest film in the world, but at least we did't have to listen to people shouting for 90 minutes.

    I've only seen this in the French with English subtitles so I'm sure it loses something in translation but it's still very funny. Jean Reno is a world renowned actor but many of the other actors in this ensemble cast were not known to me before. Valerie Lemercier was particularly good, as was the vassal Christian Clavier. This is humour along the lines of Blackadder & Baldrick, but with a time travel medieval vs modern day France twist. It does highlight the difficultly someone would have coming from the past into the modern day and like similar films the time travellers don't adjust within five minutes so it's far more convincing. It's just funny and I don't find the subtitles a distraction, and everyone's increasing hysteria makes me smile. First time I saw it, it was definitely laugh out loud humour and each time you see it there's definitely something more to see. Recommend you see the French original before the American version. Jean Reno is an awesome actor and he shines in this with comedic timing and genius; it's not many big star actors with such gravitas that will dress up in medieval undergarments and wooing "best" for a role and carry it off with so much aplomb! Funny, very very funny.

    "O-Kayyy!" - one of the many phrases that stick in one's subconscious from this film; more on that shortly As every one else has pointed out, this a time travel film but it is done with such a deftness of touch that it makes some Hollywood offerings look clumsy by comparison. The film is subtitled but the translation have been done with terrific skill. My French is just about up to the dialogue and who-ever did the work has managed to keep the humour throughout. I like the film so much that I even bought a DVD copy of both Les Visiteurs 1 and 2. Returning to "O-Kayyy!" - I was on a very busy Aires de Service in France. I was asked if I wanted the water tap turning off and without thinking shouted the reply of "O-Kayyy!" Two French, One Dutch and one German couple all collapsed with laughter. Later that evening we ran Les Visiteurs 1 on the laptop for them. The result is four friendships that have endured for more than 6 years Yes, Les Visiteurs 1 and 2are truly cinematic greats

    Directed by Jean-Marie Poir&eacute; in 1993, "The Visitors" is without a doubt one of the funniest, most quotable and most emblematic of all French comedies, marking the refreshing come-back of old-school popular cinema, in the same vein than its ancestor "La Grande Vadrouille" and descendant "Asterix: Mission Cl&eacute;opatre". No social commentary, no political correctness, only pure entertainment for both kids and adults, notably carried by the unforgettable buffoonery of Christian Clavier as Jacquouille la Fripouille and his immortal "OK-kay"? Proof that the film doesn't take its comical premise for granted; it takes almost half an hour to build the set-up before the adventure can finally take off. "The Visitors" begins in an extremely convincing historical set-up, in 1123, during a thrilling fight opposing the King Louis VI "the Fat" to his English cousin. The English are defeated thanks to the intervention of Godefroy who saves his king in extremis by decapitating an English fighter; then as a reward for his bravery, Godefroy is made Count of Montmirail and is promised to marry a duke's daughter, Frenegonde de Pouille, played by Val&eacute;rie Lemercier. Victim of a hallucination, he accidentally kills his to-be father in law, as a result, the marriage is canceled. "Only God can resurrect the dead", objects Jacquouille. Yes, but Eusebius, the Wizard, proposes another solution. Time is like a mountain made of underground galleries, and one of his most secret recipes can get Godefroy back to the past, one brief instant before the incident. Naturally, it all goes wrong and both Godefroy and Jacquouille (who had to drink first, 'just in case') are ejected in 1992. After that, the comedic core of "The Visitors" depends on a simple yet realistic promise: any person who'd be accidentally put in another era would not really be like fish in water. Think of Marty McFly in "Back to the Future" who was only thirty years too early: he was naturally seen as a weird guy. Applying the same logic, it's quite understandable that the Count Godefroy the Brave and his servant Jacquouille, who were almost nine centuries too late, would be believed to be insane. And while this is already funny, it's even funnier when they are not, like Jacquouille who lives a tender romance with an exuberant trash trailer, played by his real-life wife, Marie-Anne Chazel. The comparison with "Back to the Future" doesn't end here, like Robert Zemeckis, Jean-Marie Poir&eacute; doesn't take the comical premise of the plot for granted, to let the film go for cheap jokes begging us to laugh. The script is rich in many subplots that enrich the main story, and the performances of all the cast have the perfect dosage of over-the-top mannerisms and realistic behavior. Reno acts very naturally like a real Knight confident about his majesty, while Clavier delivers a magnificent comical performance as Jacquouille, proving that he's the worthy successor of Louis de Funes. Jacquouille la Fripouille has quickly become one of the most memorable characters of French Cinema, something that most comedies tried to achieve in an artificial way, but the public immediately loved Jacquouille, and he's now part of French Pop-Culture. And the performance of Clavier is more impressive because he also plays another prominent character of the film, as the descendant of Jacquouille, the alliteratively named Jacques-Henri Jacquard a snobbish nouveau riche who bought the Montmirail castle. Val&eacute;rie Lemercier also plays another character as the Countess Beatrice, descendant of Godefroy. Only an actress with the talent of Lemercier could have turned such a dull and bland character into an unforgettable caricature of the typical aristocrat woman, but touching in her naivety when she believes Godefroy is her cousin Hubert who mysteriously disappeared after an accidental raid. The film earned her a C&eacute;sar for Best Supporting Actress, while it was nominated for most of the major categories. But nonetheless, it was the most popular French film at that time. And speaking of popularity, that the film made half the success of the more uninspired "Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis" says a lot about the impact of Media buzz and Internet in a movie's success. Had the movie been directed 15 years later, it would have probably dethroned "La Grande Vadrouille" in the French box-office but then again, can you imagine "The Vistors" set in the 2000's, with all the movie conventions it implies: racial political correctness, special-effects overdose and all that stuff or maybe worse: excessive sentimentalism like in "Bievenue Ches les Ch'tis". I have nothing personal against Dany Boon's "Ch'tis" films but the film received so much publicity that at the end, it wasn't successful because it was popular, but quite the opposite. If only it was good enough to be forgivable, but I can't forgive a comedy that ends in an emotional note, when a punch line is required. I remember when the movie came out, it was the phenomenon of the end of the year, everyone was talking about it with so many superlatives that I couldn't believe a movie would be that funny, especially a French one. Well, I saw it on TV the first time and I laughed, my parents laughed, the whole family laughed and never did a slower moment ever change that feeling, there was not even a slow moment, the film was funny from beginning to end, with an exquisite twist at the end, the so-called punch line that cruelly lacked at the end of Dany Boon's film. At the end, the hysterical incomprehension of you-know-who when he finds himself you-know-where was the icing on an already delicious cake served with a magnificent Gothic music. We all laughed to tears, and the fun that never deserted the film is the proof that sometimes the simplest plot premises can make the most hilarious films. I was not in love with the film but with the story and the way everything worked as a set-up for a hilarious conclusion. OK-kay?

    The year is 1123.A knight and his servant are accidentally sent to the year 1992.These medieval people are pretty much like fish out of water in the modern society.Les Visiteurs (1993) is a comedy film directed by Jean-Marie Poir&eacute;.It stars Christian Clavier and Jean Reno.Clavier plays the servant Jacquouille la Fripouille and also his relative of the 90's, Jacquard.Reno plays the part of Godefroy de Papincourt, Comte de Montmirail.Val&eacute;rie Lemercier does a double role playing Godefroy's love interest Fr&eacute;negond&eacute; de Pouille and the descendant Beatrice de Montmirail.Marie-Anne Chazel plays Ginette la Clocharde.Isabelle Nanty is Fabienne Morlot.I borrowed this movie a little while back from the library.I had seen the film once before, back in 1997.I enjoyed watching it the both times.It was a big hit.So big that it got a sequel and an American version.The movie has many funny slapstick moments, like when those two wash their hands in a toilet and when they cause a flood in the house.This is a very nice time travel movie.The Americans have Back to the Future, the French have The Visitors.You can visit this movie more than once.

The French knight and his peasant servant get mixed up with a sorcerer who gives them a potion that puts them into the modern world to see his modern descendants. *Special Stars- Christian Clavier, Jena Reno, Valerie Lemercier, Maire-Anne Chazel, Christian Bjeau, *Theme- Never make an enemy of a sorcerer. *Based on- French Medieval history and popular time travel film plots. *Trivia/location/goofs- French made (English subtitles) Great costumes, and locations around the French countryside. *Emotion- Rather clever time travel comedy movie dealing with great performances from the actors. The cast plays the emotional and dramatic scenes 'dead' serious which only sets up the comedic outcome with a great finish to this film. If you are a history, Renaissance Faire, science fiction, or Francophile buff, this film is pure enjoyment and fun.
