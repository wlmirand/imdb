    Sophie's Choice is one of those films I always meant to watch, and finally got the chance. It is best to go into it with as little idea as to what it's about as possible, as it's a slow film with a lot of layers that get peeled off one by one. A young would-be-author from the South moves to Brooklyn and befriends his neighbors, the couple Nathan and Sophie. All three hit it off, but Nathan's bipolar tendencies do puncture their friendship at times. Sophie, however, is a calm soul as kind as she is tortured by her past in Auschwitz. As the author, Stingo, gets to know them better, he is also taken deeper and deeper into Sophie's past, where a hidden pain resides. Sophie's Choice brilliantly captures two polar opposite worlds. The colourful and tranquil Brooklyn is contrasted strikingly by a late 1930s Poland occupied by Nazis, where the colour drains so much out of the film that any further and it would be black-and-white. The present in Brooklyn is a good haven to have and catch our breath between glimpses into Sophie's horrible past. At the end of the day, in spite of the emotionally shattering story, Sophie's Choice is a story about hope and redemption. The performances certainly helped. Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline are both wonderful as polar opposite personalities, united by a common love for literature. But Meryl Streep is utterly mesmerizing as Sophie. It's not for no reason that this was one of those Oscar-nominated performances of hers that gave that extra edge and got her the statue. All of Sophie's mannerisms, her accent, her speaking German and Polish, her searching for words in English to express what she wants to say, her restrained kindness, her pain; none of it overdone. The director even trusted Streep enough to take long shots with her as she gets into deep characterization. This is quite simply one of the finest female performances in cinema. I did fear, throughout the film, what exactly Sophie's choice was, and I was right, for it is a scene that crushes your heart. But the film comes together in the end and ends in an emotionally satisfying way in spite of everything. Steel yourself for an emotional journey and give Sophie's Choice a view, it's a film as uplifting as it is depressing, and unmissable for cinema buffs.

    the novel. the director. and the cast. result - memorable movie. or, only, a gem. not only for grace of adaptation. or for magnificent performance of Meryl Streep. but for precise form of an universal message. for the memories of viewer. for the shadow of words and gestures. in fact, it is one of films who, after its end, becomes an experience. aesthetic, emotional and , in same time, a map more than a lesson to understand the life as a chain of profound choices, cruel sacrifices. it is difficult to write a good review. because essential is out of words. because images, the small gestures, the art of each actor, the accent of Sophie are details who gives to entire film soul. a fragile soul. must see it ! for be more rich in the exploration of every day nuances.

    The only bit of information about her on IMDb reads: "Attended Tulane University" (the field of study is not even hinted at...). Under her Filmography, there is only one title: "Sophie's Choice"... This is all that remains from a very impressive performance of 1982 by a little girl whose name was Jennifer Lawn. Those who first saw the famous "choice" scene toward the end of the film, where the Academy Award winner Meryl Streep was holding terrified little Jennifer in her arms, must have foreseen a bright future for this kid actress who might easily fool the viewers into believing that she was actually living the scene, rather than just acting it! "A future Oscar winner in the arms of a present one", one might have prophesied back in 1982. Unfortunately, this prophecy never came true... If you have seen the movie, you are certainly familiar with this intensely dramatic scene (DON'T watch it if you have NOT seen the film and plan to do so!): costas-music.blogspot.gr/2012/12/sophies-choice-choice-scene.html

    Sophie's Choice is a drama film that tells the story of a Polish immigrant, Sophie, and her tempestuous lover who share a boarding house with a young writer in Brooklyn. The film stars Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Peter MacNicol. Alan J. Pakula directed the movie and wrote the script from a novel by William Styron of the same title. Aspiring southern author Stingo (MacNichol) heads to New York to seek his fortune. Moving into a dingy Brooklyn boarding house, Stingo strikes up a friendship with research chemist Nathan Landau (Kline) and Nathan's girlfriend, Polish refugee Sophie Zawistowska (Streep). There is something unsettling about the relationship; Nathan is subject to violent mood swings, while Sophie seems to be harboring a horrible secret. Stingo soon learns that both Nathan and Sophie are strangers to truth. One evening, Stingo learns from Sophie that she was married but her husband and her father were killed in a German work camp and that she was interned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Nathan is constantly jealous, and when he is in one of his violent mood swings he convinces himself that Sophie is unfaithful to him and abuses and harasses her. There is a flashback showing Nathan rescuing Sophie from near death from anemia shortly after her immigration to the U.S. Sophie eventually reveals that her father was a Nazi sympathizer. Sophie had a lover, J&oacute;zef, who lived with his half-sister, Wanda, a leader in the Resistance. Wanda tried to convince Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but Sophie declined, fearing she might endanger her children. Two weeks later J&oacute;zef was murdered by the Gestapo, and Sophie was arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children. She reveals to him the tragic choice she was forced to make at Auschwitz. Upon arrival, she was forced to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp. To avoid having both children killed, she chose her son, Jan, to be sent to the children's camp, and her daughter, Eva, to be sent to her death in Crematorium Two. The movie is too Hollywood in look and feel, and the flashback and narration are too conventional, and yet the image of the sickly and pale Meryl Streep recollecting her ordeal lingers in memory long after the film is over. Streep is memorable as Sophie which makes her truly deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actress that she won for this movie. Though it's far from a flawless movie, it is a unified and deeply affecting movie due in part due Streep's performance and the story just takes over and happens to you. It's quite an experience.

    I had heard so much good about this movie, that now when I finally came round to see it 30 years after everybody else, I found it a bit of a disappointment. It is not until the last twenty minutes that it gets really interesting. Most of the time it is slow and boring. Also, I cannot really relate to the character of Sophie. Yes, the choice she had to do was terrible. But one has to remember, that WWII was an awful time for everybody. She was not the only one who lost a child, so to speak. But most people got their act together after the war, and went on with life. I know something of this, because of what my parents have told me from the war. My father (who was Swedish) was a young soldier then, and he lay in preparedness at the Norwegian border, in case the Germans would try to invade Sweden. This meant great suffering, as the temperature was sometimes -42 degrees C. Several of his friends lost fingers and toes to the cold, and once my father was near to succumb in a snow-storm when he had gone astray on skis on the snowy mountain. And my mother, who is Finnish, had it even worse. The Finns were at war with the Russians, my grand-father fell in this war, and my grand-mother had to try to support her four children herself. They were actually starving one winter, and they got down in various diseases - my mother for instance had diphtheria, and the Doctor told her afterward that she had been very close to death. No one in my mother's family actually died though, because of my grand-mother's great courage and wisdom. And YES I realize you cannot really compare a concentration camp and a choice like Sophie's with my parents' experiences during the war - but it is still a matter of degrees. And of attitude - and courage. I think what redeems this movie, is Stingo's (the young author) ongoing comments to the events. Because he has such a very beautiful and poetic language, and such a healthy and positive attitude to life "after all", that shines through. He is the opposite of Sophie's and Nathan's decadence, strangeness, unhealthiness, depression and black outlook on life. One can imagine, that he would really go on to become a great writer after the events in the movie..!

    Alan Pakula directs "Sophie's Choice", adapted from a William Styron novel by the same name. Both were released in the wake of the NBC miniseries "Holocaust" (1978), which rekindled mainstream interest in the Final solution. Highly melodramatic, the film's first half revolves around the tribulations of the Polish Catholic Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep), who has left Post-War Europe for life in Brooklyn, New York. Here she lives with the volatile Nathan Landau (Kevin Kline), a Jewish con man who suffers from schizophrenia. Landau is abusive toward Sophie, plays power games with her, and suspects that Sophia may have betrayed Jews or sided with the Nazis in return for her own personal safety. Both Landau and Sophie are enveloped by self hate; Sophie tortures herself because she did indeed have a secret relationship with the Nazis, whilst Landau literally embodies a kind of Jewish survivor's guilt. The tale's title initially seems to refer to a choice Sophie must make in the present, choosing between one of two lovers, Landau or a young writer called Stingo, but is eventually revealed to be a reference to a past choice given to Sophie by a Nazi officer. His ultimatum? Sophie must choose which of her two children will be killed, lest they both are. Sophie's choice  her giving up of her son  is just one psychic scar carried by the woman throughout the film; her father was a eugenicist who advocated the extermination of Jews. Styron's tale is different from most Holocaust narratives. He focuses on Christians and Slavs (the Holocaust was anti-Christian as well as anti-Semitic) and like Lumet's "The Pawnbroker", a Jew is explicitly one of the tale's key bullies. The film and the novel also differ wildly. A large portion of Styron's novel - completely absent in the film - focuses on white-on-black racism, the American South and the slave trade, and subscribed to a view which Holocaust professor Richard Rubenstein says "rejects Christian anti-Semitism as causative" in favour for the belief that "in its essential character Auschwitz was a capitalistic slave society as much as or even more than it was an extermination centre". The novel also continuously jostles Sophie's first person narratives, Stingo's POV and an omniscient narrator. The overall effect is such that the viewpoints of victims and executioners become blurred or fused together. Styron's story is also structured such that multiple narrators find themselves selfishly warring over both Sophie's body and her story, desperate to claim her "victimization" for themselves. Shades of Egoyan's "Ararat" (a more overtly "postmodern" Holocaust story, in which different tribes literally attempt to co-opt the past for themselves). Interestingly, Nathan, a kind of Doppelg&auml;nger of German sadists, is himself a Jewish Nazi, whilst the Nazi officer who forces Sophie to choose between her children is himself given an early speech in which he bemoans having to play God, a weight which he eventually grants Sophie; he allows her to also play executioner. Both Nathan and the Nazi are creatures of the "grey zone", a concept developed by Primo Levi and further elaborated upon by Giorgio Agamben. For both, the grey zone refers to the blurring of boundaries between victims and executioners, and to the murky process of contamination and collaboration by which relationships within the death camps defied any simplistic Manichaean division of good and evil, imposing instead a condition of extreme equivocation (typically in the form of double binds or impossible situations). The zone is a kind of threshold of indistinction, which calls into question the very notion of ethics. Pakula may never go down as a great director, but he was interesting in the way, like Kubrick, he tended to focus on power, conspiracy and power's reliance on double-binds and no win scenarios. Like Warren Beatty in Pakula's "Parallax View", who becomes enshrined in the Law he attempts to remain apart of and/or destroy, Sophie can't help but be complicit. Incidentally, the choice Sophie faces is known as The Double Trolley Problem, a famous thought experiment in cognitive science, neuro-ethics and philosophy. The problem typically involves a subject being given a choice between either allowing 2 trolleys to run over and so kill 2 separate people, or attaching one trolley to another so that only one person dies. The answer to the problem differs depending on whichever branch of philosophy one belongs to. A utilitarian, for example, would typically always save one person. Other schools believe that making the choice is itself an unethical act; had you not intervened, the ethical breech (making the choice to deliberately kill) does not fall on you. When confronted with this problem in surveys, most people instinctively refuse to choose, perceiving "choosing" as being a complicit and "unethical" act. When presented with the choice between photos of loved ones (who will hypothetically die), people overwhelmingly tend to refuse to make the choice as well. According to studies, this is true for over 90 percent of human beings. The less than 10 percent who make utilitarian choices display strong tendencies toward psychopathy, Machiavellianism or tend to view life as being intrinsically meaningless. The film is handsomely shot, but is overly slow and Pakula's use of the Stingo character  a literary device not necessarily needed on film  goes nowhere. The way the film manipulates us into a state of artificial suspense (what is the choice? Who does Sophie choose?) is somewhat tasteless, Pakula's delaying of "the choice" and making it "the final solution" to a mystery echoing the Nazi's manipulating and dismissing of Sophie's humanity. Meryl Streep's acting here is praised, but its overly busy and virtuosic. It's the kind of flashy acting  all surfaces and no depth - that always wins awards; Pakula should have reigned her in. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    I feel like I was sold a bill of goods. The first half of this movie was not what I came to see. And most of the last quarter for that matter. I think the movie would work much better with a basic framework like Saving Private Ryan. Set me up in the present but let the body of the movie deal with the past. That's a much more interesting subject than what they went with. Throw in how quick the titular and pivotal scene is and the movie is simultaneously plodding and rushed. And the jarring back and forth between her second choice of Stingo or Nathan. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I got whiplash in the back and forth. I can see from her background how that might have happened. I have trouble seeing from Stingo's point of view why he'd expect anything different.

    When i watched Sophies choice it was for physcology class, and I was looking at it from a physc point of view. I had no knowledge as to what it was about before i watched it other than that it had to do with a woman who was in a concentration camp. In watching this movie it was very capturing, Sophie just seemed like a typical woman who had a fight with her boyfriend but as it got further in you could see something about her lover was just not right he was very happy one minute the next he was accusing Sophie of having romance with Stingo a young writer who lived a floor below them and became very good friends with Both Nathan Sophies lover and Sophie herself. As Stingo becomes close to Sophie he starts to find out things from her past in the Camps that not even Nathan knows. There is more to it but something u would have to watch.

    History seems to me like a book where every single chapter is written under the traumatic effect of the previous one. To better understand Nazism's rise, one must understand the trauma of the 1918 Armistice on German people BUT to comprehend the French diktat of Versailles in 1919, one must also take into consideration the trauma of the French defeat against the Prussian Army in 1870. Following the same logic, History is the never-ending chronicles of successive traumas turning yesterday's losers into today's winners. But blood sometimes dries quicker than History books' ink, and while we're allowed to judge an event in a more rational and reasonable way, it leads to a very singular paradox: if you deprive your analysis from its emotional substance, you get more objective, rational, yet it can undermine your very comprehension of further events, because men make the events, and most of the times, they're guided by the weight of a traumatic experience -every act of terror takes its roots in another one- but then, if you use emotion, you lose the objectivity, which is the key element in science. To put it in simpler words: one death is a tragedy, one million is statistics, statistics are more relevant to understand the present but only tragedy can help to anticipate the future. A film like "Sophie's Choice" focuses on one tragedy to better highlight the gravity of a much more large-scaled tragic chapter of Human history: the Holocaust and its profound effect on people's minds. The world indeed would never be the same after 1945. But I'm still perplexed about the film. It tells the story of a young woman who survived the atrocities of the Concentration Camps and had to make one of the most horrific choices that was ever allowed to a mother: choosing which of her children would survive. The irony is that she's given this very privilege because she's not Jewish, she's a Catholic and what's more, not a communist, yet she would have to live with a terrible weight in her conscience, something that a Jewish mother wouldn't have to endure because she would be forced to lose her children. Another irony occurs when we discover Sophie's romance with Nathan, an American Jew, we're shocked seeing treated her as a whore for Germans, no matter how sick or demented he was. As I said, it's only through shock that you can comprehend the atrocity of an event. That Nathan carried this pain in his heritage because he was a Jew is one thing but it would be insulting to those who really lived the experience, to distribute the share of guilt and sorrow in the hearts of people who didn't live it, regardless of their ethnic background. So, I'm trying to figure out what the clear purpose of Sophie's story is? I try to imagine what was Alan J. Pakula's thinking when he decided to make the film. He probably thought that it would be great to have a film depicting one of the most horrific and painful dilemmas ever, carried by a marvelous performance from Meryl Streep, who was in her path for cinematic glory. Then, she'd have to tell her story in flashback, because the choice would only work if it came late in a film, to let us sense a trauma hidden inside her heart. But something must provoke the confession; it must be about children, then Stingo, the young idealistic writer, played by Peter MacNicol must ask Sophie for marrying her. Step by step, we get to the necessity of featuring this sort of triangular love between three friends, Nathan, Sophie's lover, Sophie, a Polish Auschwitz survivor with a lovable accent, and the sweet and naive Southern boy who'll naturally fall in love with them, mirroring their very passion for American literature. The promise of the film is carried by three spectacular performances and a sweet and tender score, but I failed to connect the story to the flashbacks and I wonder what the results would have been if the story was simply about Sophie's experience. The movie is guided by Nathan's weird behavior, Sophie's attempts to speak the most correct English, and Stingo's passive observations, the whole thing enrobed by a sort of back-story involving a passion for English and literature. The feelings driven by these parts go from amusing to infuriating, we're touched by Stingo's sweetness, frustrated by Nathan's lunacy and impressed or not by Meryl Streep's remarkable performance. There's a sort of lightness floating in the air that efficiently contrasts with the darkness of the flashback, but when the flashback started, I felt the weakness of the first hour and half that immediately felt like an overlong set-up and made me wonder what was so special to make this film in the American Film Institute's Top 100? One spectacular moment can redeem a whole film  or is it just because it's a Holocaust story  or a coming of age story of a kid who discovered the world's sudden cruelty from Sophie's trauma? Hadn't he heard about writers like Sartre or Camus who expressed their angst toward a world that allowed the Holocaust to happen and accept the idea of a Nuclear bomb wiping out Japanese civilians? To the choice, yes, it remains one of the most heart-breaking moments in cinema's history as I was haunted by the genuinely frightened look of Sophie's daughter and her piercing cries while she was taken in the misty dark under the powerless look of Sophie. Yes, Meryl Streep deserved the Award for that very part. But the rest belonged to another film, and instead of making another 'Holocaust' story, which I'm sure, would have been extraordinary, I trust Pakula's talent for that. He chose the option of a character study but he thinks too much of us on that level, because all the intelligibility of the world can't get over the shock deeply rooted in the experience.

    When Meryl Streep's Sophie slowly discloses her holocaust experience to Peter MacNicol's Stingo I literally felt I was witnessing the entire experience first-hand. Have I had such an experience with any other actor? No, I never have. Part of the credit goes to Alan Pakula for representing the event starkly but a majority of the effort is from Streep who can be termed as the 'best storyteller in the world'. &nbsp;I could sense her caliber in Out of Africa when she importunes the Governor to help the Africans and during the courtroom scene in Kramer vs Kramer, but only in Sophie's Choice could I see no Meryl but a completely different person by the name of Sophie Zawistowska. But that was also the case with Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot, but Meryl, in my opinion, had such a difficult character to portray that to achieve the effect of transporting the audience into Sophie's world without faltering any moment is the pinnacle of the state 'I am' in acting. &nbsp;Some say she her Polish/German/Broken English accent and diction weren't believable enough; my only advice to them is - try perfecting a foreign accent in 3 months yourself. On top of that, Meryl had to transcend Sophie on to the screen, not just with the accents, but with gestures, movements&nbsp;and more importantly, feelings. And Sophie has probably the saddest fate a woman could have - she was married to fear, grief and loss, first during Holocaust and then after the event. Throughout her life, she has had to make choices, many against her conscience; not only the choice that gives the film it's name, but also others for example, in spite of loathing her father's ideals, she used her pure blood status to escape more misery. But the ghosts of her past slowly unravel when Stingo, a young simpleton author develops friendship with her and her lover, the volatile Nathan. And Meryl does all this with uttermost sincerity and spontaneity, never faking it even when she could have got away with it because many people fall for pretenses. &nbsp;I'll tell you about a play I had seen yesterday where one of the actors, as the situation was reaching it's climax, began screaming his lines out as if stung on the rear by a bee. &nbsp; The audience, to my dismay, was in raptures, with an old lady besides me commenting "Superb performance" and I was like " O these audiences can be tricked so easily!". So there may be people who find Meryl's performance to be 'dull' at first, and it is because they believe only an external representation of emotions is enough. I request these people to surrender themselves to Sophie, rather than thinking about how she could have cried buckets instead of just one teardrop to show that she was sad. The character is embodied so completely that I may not be able to endure Sophie's misery again. The choice scene, when watched during the film, is a million times more painful than watching the four minute clip separately on YouTube. The most powerful performance I have witnessed by an actor or actress. Kline and MacNicol have a hard time measuring up to her, but in a way, they gave better performance because of the support they got from Streep's performance. Kline is theatrical but his act suits his character well at times. MacNicol doesn't fail but he neither succeeds in fully justifying his difficult character. The supporting cast, mostly consisting of Germans give authentic performances, the best one coming from the little girl playing Sophie's child, the Nazi officer and the German officer's daughter. The background score is haunting and perfectly placed in the scenes. &nbsp;I frankly wanted more much Sophie and could do without that young coarse lady who had a short-lived romance with Stingo. It was an extraordinary experience watching Meryl acting as a medium for Sophie Zawistowska and a harrowing one to see Sophie's misery. My Rating: 9 out of 10

    Sophie's Choice is one of those films I always meant to watch, and finally got the chance. It is best to go into it with as little idea as to what it's about as possible, as it's a slow film with a lot of layers that get peeled off one by one. A young would-be-author from the South moves to Brooklyn and befriends his neighbors, the couple Nathan and Sophie. All three hit it off, but Nathan's bipolar tendencies do puncture their friendship at times. Sophie, however, is a calm soul as kind as she is tortured by her past in Auschwitz. As the author, Stingo, gets to know them better, he is also taken deeper and deeper into Sophie's past, where a hidden pain resides. Sophie's Choice brilliantly captures two polar opposite worlds. The colourful and tranquil Brooklyn is contrasted strikingly by a late 1930s Poland occupied by Nazis, where the colour drains so much out of the film that any further and it would be black-and-white. The present in Brooklyn is a good haven to have and catch our breath between glimpses into Sophie's horrible past. At the end of the day, in spite of the emotionally shattering story, Sophie's Choice is a story about hope and redemption. The performances certainly helped. Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline are both wonderful as polar opposite personalities, united by a common love for literature. But Meryl Streep is utterly mesmerizing as Sophie. It's not for no reason that this was one of those Oscar-nominated performances of hers that gave that extra edge and got her the statue. All of Sophie's mannerisms, her accent, her speaking German and Polish, her searching for words in English to express what she wants to say, her restrained kindness, her pain; none of it overdone. The director even trusted Streep enough to take long shots with her as she gets into deep characterization. This is quite simply one of the finest female performances in cinema. I did fear, throughout the film, what exactly Sophie's choice was, and I was right, for it is a scene that crushes your heart. But the film comes together in the end and ends in an emotionally satisfying way in spite of everything. Steel yourself for an emotional journey and give Sophie's Choice a view, it's a film as uplifting as it is depressing, and unmissable for cinema buffs.

    the novel. the director. and the cast. result - memorable movie. or, only, a gem. not only for grace of adaptation. or for magnificent performance of Meryl Streep. but for precise form of an universal message. for the memories of viewer. for the shadow of words and gestures. in fact, it is one of films who, after its end, becomes an experience. aesthetic, emotional and , in same time, a map more than a lesson to understand the life as a chain of profound choices, cruel sacrifices. it is difficult to write a good review. because essential is out of words. because images, the small gestures, the art of each actor, the accent of Sophie are details who gives to entire film soul. a fragile soul. must see it ! for be more rich in the exploration of every day nuances.

    The only bit of information about her on IMDb reads: "Attended Tulane University" (the field of study is not even hinted at...). Under her Filmography, there is only one title: "Sophie's Choice"... This is all that remains from a very impressive performance of 1982 by a little girl whose name was Jennifer Lawn. Those who first saw the famous "choice" scene toward the end of the film, where the Academy Award winner Meryl Streep was holding terrified little Jennifer in her arms, must have foreseen a bright future for this kid actress who might easily fool the viewers into believing that she was actually living the scene, rather than just acting it! "A future Oscar winner in the arms of a present one", one might have prophesied back in 1982. Unfortunately, this prophecy never came true... If you have seen the movie, you are certainly familiar with this intensely dramatic scene (DON'T watch it if you have NOT seen the film and plan to do so!): costas-music.blogspot.gr/2012/12/sophies-choice-choice-scene.html

    Sophie's Choice is a drama film that tells the story of a Polish immigrant, Sophie, and her tempestuous lover who share a boarding house with a young writer in Brooklyn. The film stars Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Peter MacNicol. Alan J. Pakula directed the movie and wrote the script from a novel by William Styron of the same title. Aspiring southern author Stingo (MacNichol) heads to New York to seek his fortune. Moving into a dingy Brooklyn boarding house, Stingo strikes up a friendship with research chemist Nathan Landau (Kline) and Nathan's girlfriend, Polish refugee Sophie Zawistowska (Streep). There is something unsettling about the relationship; Nathan is subject to violent mood swings, while Sophie seems to be harboring a horrible secret. Stingo soon learns that both Nathan and Sophie are strangers to truth. One evening, Stingo learns from Sophie that she was married but her husband and her father were killed in a German work camp and that she was interned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Nathan is constantly jealous, and when he is in one of his violent mood swings he convinces himself that Sophie is unfaithful to him and abuses and harasses her. There is a flashback showing Nathan rescuing Sophie from near death from anemia shortly after her immigration to the U.S. Sophie eventually reveals that her father was a Nazi sympathizer. Sophie had a lover, J&oacute;zef, who lived with his half-sister, Wanda, a leader in the Resistance. Wanda tried to convince Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but Sophie declined, fearing she might endanger her children. Two weeks later J&oacute;zef was murdered by the Gestapo, and Sophie was arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children. She reveals to him the tragic choice she was forced to make at Auschwitz. Upon arrival, she was forced to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp. To avoid having both children killed, she chose her son, Jan, to be sent to the children's camp, and her daughter, Eva, to be sent to her death in Crematorium Two. The movie is too Hollywood in look and feel, and the flashback and narration are too conventional, and yet the image of the sickly and pale Meryl Streep recollecting her ordeal lingers in memory long after the film is over. Streep is memorable as Sophie which makes her truly deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actress that she won for this movie. Though it's far from a flawless movie, it is a unified and deeply affecting movie due in part due Streep's performance and the story just takes over and happens to you. It's quite an experience.

    I had heard so much good about this movie, that now when I finally came round to see it 30 years after everybody else, I found it a bit of a disappointment. It is not until the last twenty minutes that it gets really interesting. Most of the time it is slow and boring. Also, I cannot really relate to the character of Sophie. Yes, the choice she had to do was terrible. But one has to remember, that WWII was an awful time for everybody. She was not the only one who lost a child, so to speak. But most people got their act together after the war, and went on with life. I know something of this, because of what my parents have told me from the war. My father (who was Swedish) was a young soldier then, and he lay in preparedness at the Norwegian border, in case the Germans would try to invade Sweden. This meant great suffering, as the temperature was sometimes -42 degrees C. Several of his friends lost fingers and toes to the cold, and once my father was near to succumb in a snow-storm when he had gone astray on skis on the snowy mountain. And my mother, who is Finnish, had it even worse. The Finns were at war with the Russians, my grand-father fell in this war, and my grand-mother had to try to support her four children herself. They were actually starving one winter, and they got down in various diseases - my mother for instance had diphtheria, and the Doctor told her afterward that she had been very close to death. No one in my mother's family actually died though, because of my grand-mother's great courage and wisdom. And YES I realize you cannot really compare a concentration camp and a choice like Sophie's with my parents' experiences during the war - but it is still a matter of degrees. And of attitude - and courage. I think what redeems this movie, is Stingo's (the young author) ongoing comments to the events. Because he has such a very beautiful and poetic language, and such a healthy and positive attitude to life "after all", that shines through. He is the opposite of Sophie's and Nathan's decadence, strangeness, unhealthiness, depression and black outlook on life. One can imagine, that he would really go on to become a great writer after the events in the movie..!

    Alan Pakula directs "Sophie's Choice", adapted from a William Styron novel by the same name. Both were released in the wake of the NBC miniseries "Holocaust" (1978), which rekindled mainstream interest in the Final solution. Highly melodramatic, the film's first half revolves around the tribulations of the Polish Catholic Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep), who has left Post-War Europe for life in Brooklyn, New York. Here she lives with the volatile Nathan Landau (Kevin Kline), a Jewish con man who suffers from schizophrenia. Landau is abusive toward Sophie, plays power games with her, and suspects that Sophia may have betrayed Jews or sided with the Nazis in return for her own personal safety. Both Landau and Sophie are enveloped by self hate; Sophie tortures herself because she did indeed have a secret relationship with the Nazis, whilst Landau literally embodies a kind of Jewish survivor's guilt. The tale's title initially seems to refer to a choice Sophie must make in the present, choosing between one of two lovers, Landau or a young writer called Stingo, but is eventually revealed to be a reference to a past choice given to Sophie by a Nazi officer. His ultimatum? Sophie must choose which of her two children will be killed, lest they both are. Sophie's choice  her giving up of her son  is just one psychic scar carried by the woman throughout the film; her father was a eugenicist who advocated the extermination of Jews. Styron's tale is different from most Holocaust narratives. He focuses on Christians and Slavs (the Holocaust was anti-Christian as well as anti-Semitic) and like Lumet's "The Pawnbroker", a Jew is explicitly one of the tale's key bullies. The film and the novel also differ wildly. A large portion of Styron's novel - completely absent in the film - focuses on white-on-black racism, the American South and the slave trade, and subscribed to a view which Holocaust professor Richard Rubenstein says "rejects Christian anti-Semitism as causative" in favour for the belief that "in its essential character Auschwitz was a capitalistic slave society as much as or even more than it was an extermination centre". The novel also continuously jostles Sophie's first person narratives, Stingo's POV and an omniscient narrator. The overall effect is such that the viewpoints of victims and executioners become blurred or fused together. Styron's story is also structured such that multiple narrators find themselves selfishly warring over both Sophie's body and her story, desperate to claim her "victimization" for themselves. Shades of Egoyan's "Ararat" (a more overtly "postmodern" Holocaust story, in which different tribes literally attempt to co-opt the past for themselves). Interestingly, Nathan, a kind of Doppelg&auml;nger of German sadists, is himself a Jewish Nazi, whilst the Nazi officer who forces Sophie to choose between her children is himself given an early speech in which he bemoans having to play God, a weight which he eventually grants Sophie; he allows her to also play executioner. Both Nathan and the Nazi are creatures of the "grey zone", a concept developed by Primo Levi and further elaborated upon by Giorgio Agamben. For both, the grey zone refers to the blurring of boundaries between victims and executioners, and to the murky process of contamination and collaboration by which relationships within the death camps defied any simplistic Manichaean division of good and evil, imposing instead a condition of extreme equivocation (typically in the form of double binds or impossible situations). The zone is a kind of threshold of indistinction, which calls into question the very notion of ethics. Pakula may never go down as a great director, but he was interesting in the way, like Kubrick, he tended to focus on power, conspiracy and power's reliance on double-binds and no win scenarios. Like Warren Beatty in Pakula's "Parallax View", who becomes enshrined in the Law he attempts to remain apart of and/or destroy, Sophie can't help but be complicit. Incidentally, the choice Sophie faces is known as The Double Trolley Problem, a famous thought experiment in cognitive science, neuro-ethics and philosophy. The problem typically involves a subject being given a choice between either allowing 2 trolleys to run over and so kill 2 separate people, or attaching one trolley to another so that only one person dies. The answer to the problem differs depending on whichever branch of philosophy one belongs to. A utilitarian, for example, would typically always save one person. Other schools believe that making the choice is itself an unethical act; had you not intervened, the ethical breech (making the choice to deliberately kill) does not fall on you. When confronted with this problem in surveys, most people instinctively refuse to choose, perceiving "choosing" as being a complicit and "unethical" act. When presented with the choice between photos of loved ones (who will hypothetically die), people overwhelmingly tend to refuse to make the choice as well. According to studies, this is true for over 90 percent of human beings. The less than 10 percent who make utilitarian choices display strong tendencies toward psychopathy, Machiavellianism or tend to view life as being intrinsically meaningless. The film is handsomely shot, but is overly slow and Pakula's use of the Stingo character  a literary device not necessarily needed on film  goes nowhere. The way the film manipulates us into a state of artificial suspense (what is the choice? Who does Sophie choose?) is somewhat tasteless, Pakula's delaying of "the choice" and making it "the final solution" to a mystery echoing the Nazi's manipulating and dismissing of Sophie's humanity. Meryl Streep's acting here is praised, but its overly busy and virtuosic. It's the kind of flashy acting  all surfaces and no depth - that always wins awards; Pakula should have reigned her in. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    I feel like I was sold a bill of goods. The first half of this movie was not what I came to see. And most of the last quarter for that matter. I think the movie would work much better with a basic framework like Saving Private Ryan. Set me up in the present but let the body of the movie deal with the past. That's a much more interesting subject than what they went with. Throw in how quick the titular and pivotal scene is and the movie is simultaneously plodding and rushed. And the jarring back and forth between her second choice of Stingo or Nathan. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I got whiplash in the back and forth. I can see from her background how that might have happened. I have trouble seeing from Stingo's point of view why he'd expect anything different.

    When i watched Sophies choice it was for physcology class, and I was looking at it from a physc point of view. I had no knowledge as to what it was about before i watched it other than that it had to do with a woman who was in a concentration camp. In watching this movie it was very capturing, Sophie just seemed like a typical woman who had a fight with her boyfriend but as it got further in you could see something about her lover was just not right he was very happy one minute the next he was accusing Sophie of having romance with Stingo a young writer who lived a floor below them and became very good friends with Both Nathan Sophies lover and Sophie herself. As Stingo becomes close to Sophie he starts to find out things from her past in the Camps that not even Nathan knows. There is more to it but something u would have to watch.

    History seems to me like a book where every single chapter is written under the traumatic effect of the previous one. To better understand Nazism's rise, one must understand the trauma of the 1918 Armistice on German people BUT to comprehend the French diktat of Versailles in 1919, one must also take into consideration the trauma of the French defeat against the Prussian Army in 1870. Following the same logic, History is the never-ending chronicles of successive traumas turning yesterday's losers into today's winners. But blood sometimes dries quicker than History books' ink, and while we're allowed to judge an event in a more rational and reasonable way, it leads to a very singular paradox: if you deprive your analysis from its emotional substance, you get more objective, rational, yet it can undermine your very comprehension of further events, because men make the events, and most of the times, they're guided by the weight of a traumatic experience -every act of terror takes its roots in another one- but then, if you use emotion, you lose the objectivity, which is the key element in science. To put it in simpler words: one death is a tragedy, one million is statistics, statistics are more relevant to understand the present but only tragedy can help to anticipate the future. A film like "Sophie's Choice" focuses on one tragedy to better highlight the gravity of a much more large-scaled tragic chapter of Human history: the Holocaust and its profound effect on people's minds. The world indeed would never be the same after 1945. But I'm still perplexed about the film. It tells the story of a young woman who survived the atrocities of the Concentration Camps and had to make one of the most horrific choices that was ever allowed to a mother: choosing which of her children would survive. The irony is that she's given this very privilege because she's not Jewish, she's a Catholic and what's more, not a communist, yet she would have to live with a terrible weight in her conscience, something that a Jewish mother wouldn't have to endure because she would be forced to lose her children. Another irony occurs when we discover Sophie's romance with Nathan, an American Jew, we're shocked seeing treated her as a whore for Germans, no matter how sick or demented he was. As I said, it's only through shock that you can comprehend the atrocity of an event. That Nathan carried this pain in his heritage because he was a Jew is one thing but it would be insulting to those who really lived the experience, to distribute the share of guilt and sorrow in the hearts of people who didn't live it, regardless of their ethnic background. So, I'm trying to figure out what the clear purpose of Sophie's story is? I try to imagine what was Alan J. Pakula's thinking when he decided to make the film. He probably thought that it would be great to have a film depicting one of the most horrific and painful dilemmas ever, carried by a marvelous performance from Meryl Streep, who was in her path for cinematic glory. Then, she'd have to tell her story in flashback, because the choice would only work if it came late in a film, to let us sense a trauma hidden inside her heart. But something must provoke the confession; it must be about children, then Stingo, the young idealistic writer, played by Peter MacNicol must ask Sophie for marrying her. Step by step, we get to the necessity of featuring this sort of triangular love between three friends, Nathan, Sophie's lover, Sophie, a Polish Auschwitz survivor with a lovable accent, and the sweet and naive Southern boy who'll naturally fall in love with them, mirroring their very passion for American literature. The promise of the film is carried by three spectacular performances and a sweet and tender score, but I failed to connect the story to the flashbacks and I wonder what the results would have been if the story was simply about Sophie's experience. The movie is guided by Nathan's weird behavior, Sophie's attempts to speak the most correct English, and Stingo's passive observations, the whole thing enrobed by a sort of back-story involving a passion for English and literature. The feelings driven by these parts go from amusing to infuriating, we're touched by Stingo's sweetness, frustrated by Nathan's lunacy and impressed or not by Meryl Streep's remarkable performance. There's a sort of lightness floating in the air that efficiently contrasts with the darkness of the flashback, but when the flashback started, I felt the weakness of the first hour and half that immediately felt like an overlong set-up and made me wonder what was so special to make this film in the American Film Institute's Top 100? One spectacular moment can redeem a whole film  or is it just because it's a Holocaust story  or a coming of age story of a kid who discovered the world's sudden cruelty from Sophie's trauma? Hadn't he heard about writers like Sartre or Camus who expressed their angst toward a world that allowed the Holocaust to happen and accept the idea of a Nuclear bomb wiping out Japanese civilians? To the choice, yes, it remains one of the most heart-breaking moments in cinema's history as I was haunted by the genuinely frightened look of Sophie's daughter and her piercing cries while she was taken in the misty dark under the powerless look of Sophie. Yes, Meryl Streep deserved the Award for that very part. But the rest belonged to another film, and instead of making another 'Holocaust' story, which I'm sure, would have been extraordinary, I trust Pakula's talent for that. He chose the option of a character study but he thinks too much of us on that level, because all the intelligibility of the world can't get over the shock deeply rooted in the experience.

    When Meryl Streep's Sophie slowly discloses her holocaust experience to Peter MacNicol's Stingo I literally felt I was witnessing the entire experience first-hand. Have I had such an experience with any other actor? No, I never have. Part of the credit goes to Alan Pakula for representing the event starkly but a majority of the effort is from Streep who can be termed as the 'best storyteller in the world'. &nbsp;I could sense her caliber in Out of Africa when she importunes the Governor to help the Africans and during the courtroom scene in Kramer vs Kramer, but only in Sophie's Choice could I see no Meryl but a completely different person by the name of Sophie Zawistowska. But that was also the case with Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot, but Meryl, in my opinion, had such a difficult character to portray that to achieve the effect of transporting the audience into Sophie's world without faltering any moment is the pinnacle of the state 'I am' in acting. &nbsp;Some say she her Polish/German/Broken English accent and diction weren't believable enough; my only advice to them is - try perfecting a foreign accent in 3 months yourself. On top of that, Meryl had to transcend Sophie on to the screen, not just with the accents, but with gestures, movements&nbsp;and more importantly, feelings. And Sophie has probably the saddest fate a woman could have - she was married to fear, grief and loss, first during Holocaust and then after the event. Throughout her life, she has had to make choices, many against her conscience; not only the choice that gives the film it's name, but also others for example, in spite of loathing her father's ideals, she used her pure blood status to escape more misery. But the ghosts of her past slowly unravel when Stingo, a young simpleton author develops friendship with her and her lover, the volatile Nathan. And Meryl does all this with uttermost sincerity and spontaneity, never faking it even when she could have got away with it because many people fall for pretenses. &nbsp;I'll tell you about a play I had seen yesterday where one of the actors, as the situation was reaching it's climax, began screaming his lines out as if stung on the rear by a bee. &nbsp; The audience, to my dismay, was in raptures, with an old lady besides me commenting "Superb performance" and I was like " O these audiences can be tricked so easily!". So there may be people who find Meryl's performance to be 'dull' at first, and it is because they believe only an external representation of emotions is enough. I request these people to surrender themselves to Sophie, rather than thinking about how she could have cried buckets instead of just one teardrop to show that she was sad. The character is embodied so completely that I may not be able to endure Sophie's misery again. The choice scene, when watched during the film, is a million times more painful than watching the four minute clip separately on YouTube. The most powerful performance I have witnessed by an actor or actress. Kline and MacNicol have a hard time measuring up to her, but in a way, they gave better performance because of the support they got from Streep's performance. Kline is theatrical but his act suits his character well at times. MacNicol doesn't fail but he neither succeeds in fully justifying his difficult character. The supporting cast, mostly consisting of Germans give authentic performances, the best one coming from the little girl playing Sophie's child, the Nazi officer and the German officer's daughter. The background score is haunting and perfectly placed in the scenes. &nbsp;I frankly wanted more much Sophie and could do without that young coarse lady who had a short-lived romance with Stingo. It was an extraordinary experience watching Meryl acting as a medium for Sophie Zawistowska and a harrowing one to see Sophie's misery. My Rating: 9 out of 10

    Sophie's Choice is one of those films I always meant to watch, and finally got the chance. It is best to go into it with as little idea as to what it's about as possible, as it's a slow film with a lot of layers that get peeled off one by one. A young would-be-author from the South moves to Brooklyn and befriends his neighbors, the couple Nathan and Sophie. All three hit it off, but Nathan's bipolar tendencies do puncture their friendship at times. Sophie, however, is a calm soul as kind as she is tortured by her past in Auschwitz. As the author, Stingo, gets to know them better, he is also taken deeper and deeper into Sophie's past, where a hidden pain resides. Sophie's Choice brilliantly captures two polar opposite worlds. The colourful and tranquil Brooklyn is contrasted strikingly by a late 1930s Poland occupied by Nazis, where the colour drains so much out of the film that any further and it would be black-and-white. The present in Brooklyn is a good haven to have and catch our breath between glimpses into Sophie's horrible past. At the end of the day, in spite of the emotionally shattering story, Sophie's Choice is a story about hope and redemption. The performances certainly helped. Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline are both wonderful as polar opposite personalities, united by a common love for literature. But Meryl Streep is utterly mesmerizing as Sophie. It's not for no reason that this was one of those Oscar-nominated performances of hers that gave that extra edge and got her the statue. All of Sophie's mannerisms, her accent, her speaking German and Polish, her searching for words in English to express what she wants to say, her restrained kindness, her pain; none of it overdone. The director even trusted Streep enough to take long shots with her as she gets into deep characterization. This is quite simply one of the finest female performances in cinema. I did fear, throughout the film, what exactly Sophie's choice was, and I was right, for it is a scene that crushes your heart. But the film comes together in the end and ends in an emotionally satisfying way in spite of everything. Steel yourself for an emotional journey and give Sophie's Choice a view, it's a film as uplifting as it is depressing, and unmissable for cinema buffs.

    The only bit of information about her on IMDb reads: "Attended Tulane University" (the field of study is not even hinted at...). Under her Filmography, there is only one title: "Sophie's Choice"... This is all that remains from a very impressive performance of 1982 by a little girl whose name was Jennifer Lawn. Those who first saw the famous "choice" scene toward the end of the film, where the Academy Award winner Meryl Streep was holding terrified little Jennifer in her arms, must have foreseen a bright future for this kid actress who might easily fool the viewers into believing that she was actually living the scene, rather than just acting it! "A future Oscar winner in the arms of a present one", one might have prophesied back in 1982. Unfortunately, this prophecy never came true... If you have seen the movie, you are certainly familiar with this intensely dramatic scene (DON'T watch it if you have NOT seen the film and plan to do so!): costas-music.blogspot.gr/2012/12/sophies-choice-choice-scene.html

    Sophie's Choice is a drama film that tells the story of a Polish immigrant, Sophie, and her tempestuous lover who share a boarding house with a young writer in Brooklyn. The film stars Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Peter MacNicol. Alan J. Pakula directed the movie and wrote the script from a novel by William Styron of the same title. Aspiring southern author Stingo (MacNichol) heads to New York to seek his fortune. Moving into a dingy Brooklyn boarding house, Stingo strikes up a friendship with research chemist Nathan Landau (Kline) and Nathan's girlfriend, Polish refugee Sophie Zawistowska (Streep). There is something unsettling about the relationship; Nathan is subject to violent mood swings, while Sophie seems to be harboring a horrible secret. Stingo soon learns that both Nathan and Sophie are strangers to truth. One evening, Stingo learns from Sophie that she was married but her husband and her father were killed in a German work camp and that she was interned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Nathan is constantly jealous, and when he is in one of his violent mood swings he convinces himself that Sophie is unfaithful to him and abuses and harasses her. There is a flashback showing Nathan rescuing Sophie from near death from anemia shortly after her immigration to the U.S. Sophie eventually reveals that her father was a Nazi sympathizer. Sophie had a lover, J&oacute;zef, who lived with his half-sister, Wanda, a leader in the Resistance. Wanda tried to convince Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but Sophie declined, fearing she might endanger her children. Two weeks later J&oacute;zef was murdered by the Gestapo, and Sophie was arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children. She reveals to him the tragic choice she was forced to make at Auschwitz. Upon arrival, she was forced to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp. To avoid having both children killed, she chose her son, Jan, to be sent to the children's camp, and her daughter, Eva, to be sent to her death in Crematorium Two. The movie is too Hollywood in look and feel, and the flashback and narration are too conventional, and yet the image of the sickly and pale Meryl Streep recollecting her ordeal lingers in memory long after the film is over. Streep is memorable as Sophie which makes her truly deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actress that she won for this movie. Though it's far from a flawless movie, it is a unified and deeply affecting movie due in part due Streep's performance and the story just takes over and happens to you. It's quite an experience.

    I had heard so much good about this movie, that now when I finally came round to see it 30 years after everybody else, I found it a bit of a disappointment. It is not until the last twenty minutes that it gets really interesting. Most of the time it is slow and boring. Also, I cannot really relate to the character of Sophie. Yes, the choice she had to do was terrible. But one has to remember, that WWII was an awful time for everybody. She was not the only one who lost a child, so to speak. But most people got their act together after the war, and went on with life. I know something of this, because of what my parents have told me from the war. My father (who was Swedish) was a young soldier then, and he lay in preparedness at the Norwegian border, in case the Germans would try to invade Sweden. This meant great suffering, as the temperature was sometimes -42 degrees C. Several of his friends lost fingers and toes to the cold, and once my father was near to succumb in a snow-storm when he had gone astray on skis on the snowy mountain. And my mother, who is Finnish, had it even worse. The Finns were at war with the Russians, my grand-father fell in this war, and my grand-mother had to try to support her four children herself. They were actually starving one winter, and they got down in various diseases - my mother for instance had diphtheria, and the Doctor told her afterward that she had been very close to death. No one in my mother's family actually died though, because of my grand-mother's great courage and wisdom. And YES I realize you cannot really compare a concentration camp and a choice like Sophie's with my parents' experiences during the war - but it is still a matter of degrees. And of attitude - and courage. I think what redeems this movie, is Stingo's (the young author) ongoing comments to the events. Because he has such a very beautiful and poetic language, and such a healthy and positive attitude to life "after all", that shines through. He is the opposite of Sophie's and Nathan's decadence, strangeness, unhealthiness, depression and black outlook on life. One can imagine, that he would really go on to become a great writer after the events in the movie..!

    Alan Pakula directs "Sophie's Choice", adapted from a William Styron novel by the same name. Both were released in the wake of the NBC miniseries "Holocaust" (1978), which rekindled mainstream interest in the Final solution. Highly melodramatic, the film's first half revolves around the tribulations of the Polish Catholic Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep), who has left Post-War Europe for life in Brooklyn, New York. Here she lives with the volatile Nathan Landau (Kevin Kline), a Jewish con man who suffers from schizophrenia. Landau is abusive toward Sophie, plays power games with her, and suspects that Sophia may have betrayed Jews or sided with the Nazis in return for her own personal safety. Both Landau and Sophie are enveloped by self hate; Sophie tortures herself because she did indeed have a secret relationship with the Nazis, whilst Landau literally embodies a kind of Jewish survivor's guilt. The tale's title initially seems to refer to a choice Sophie must make in the present, choosing between one of two lovers, Landau or a young writer called Stingo, but is eventually revealed to be a reference to a past choice given to Sophie by a Nazi officer. His ultimatum? Sophie must choose which of her two children will be killed, lest they both are. Sophie's choice  her giving up of her son  is just one psychic scar carried by the woman throughout the film; her father was a eugenicist who advocated the extermination of Jews. Styron's tale is different from most Holocaust narratives. He focuses on Christians and Slavs (the Holocaust was anti-Christian as well as anti-Semitic) and like Lumet's "The Pawnbroker", a Jew is explicitly one of the tale's key bullies. The film and the novel also differ wildly. A large portion of Styron's novel - completely absent in the film - focuses on white-on-black racism, the American South and the slave trade, and subscribed to a view which Holocaust professor Richard Rubenstein says "rejects Christian anti-Semitism as causative" in favour for the belief that "in its essential character Auschwitz was a capitalistic slave society as much as or even more than it was an extermination centre". The novel also continuously jostles Sophie's first person narratives, Stingo's POV and an omniscient narrator. The overall effect is such that the viewpoints of victims and executioners become blurred or fused together. Styron's story is also structured such that multiple narrators find themselves selfishly warring over both Sophie's body and her story, desperate to claim her "victimization" for themselves. Shades of Egoyan's "Ararat" (a more overtly "postmodern" Holocaust story, in which different tribes literally attempt to co-opt the past for themselves). Interestingly, Nathan, a kind of Doppelg&auml;nger of German sadists, is himself a Jewish Nazi, whilst the Nazi officer who forces Sophie to choose between her children is himself given an early speech in which he bemoans having to play God, a weight which he eventually grants Sophie; he allows her to also play executioner. Both Nathan and the Nazi are creatures of the "grey zone", a concept developed by Primo Levi and further elaborated upon by Giorgio Agamben. For both, the grey zone refers to the blurring of boundaries between victims and executioners, and to the murky process of contamination and collaboration by which relationships within the death camps defied any simplistic Manichaean division of good and evil, imposing instead a condition of extreme equivocation (typically in the form of double binds or impossible situations). The zone is a kind of threshold of indistinction, which calls into question the very notion of ethics. Pakula may never go down as a great director, but he was interesting in the way, like Kubrick, he tended to focus on power, conspiracy and power's reliance on double-binds and no win scenarios. Like Warren Beatty in Pakula's "Parallax View", who becomes enshrined in the Law he attempts to remain apart of and/or destroy, Sophie can't help but be complicit. Incidentally, the choice Sophie faces is known as The Double Trolley Problem, a famous thought experiment in cognitive science, neuro-ethics and philosophy. The problem typically involves a subject being given a choice between either allowing 2 trolleys to run over and so kill 2 separate people, or attaching one trolley to another so that only one person dies. The answer to the problem differs depending on whichever branch of philosophy one belongs to. A utilitarian, for example, would typically always save one person. Other schools believe that making the choice is itself an unethical act; had you not intervened, the ethical breech (making the choice to deliberately kill) does not fall on you. When confronted with this problem in surveys, most people instinctively refuse to choose, perceiving "choosing" as being a complicit and "unethical" act. When presented with the choice between photos of loved ones (who will hypothetically die), people overwhelmingly tend to refuse to make the choice as well. According to studies, this is true for over 90 percent of human beings. The less than 10 percent who make utilitarian choices display strong tendencies toward psychopathy, Machiavellianism or tend to view life as being intrinsically meaningless. The film is handsomely shot, but is overly slow and Pakula's use of the Stingo character  a literary device not necessarily needed on film  goes nowhere. The way the film manipulates us into a state of artificial suspense (what is the choice? Who does Sophie choose?) is somewhat tasteless, Pakula's delaying of "the choice" and making it "the final solution" to a mystery echoing the Nazi's manipulating and dismissing of Sophie's humanity. Meryl Streep's acting here is praised, but its overly busy and virtuosic. It's the kind of flashy acting  all surfaces and no depth - that always wins awards; Pakula should have reigned her in. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    I feel like I was sold a bill of goods. The first half of this movie was not what I came to see. And most of the last quarter for that matter. I think the movie would work much better with a basic framework like Saving Private Ryan. Set me up in the present but let the body of the movie deal with the past. That's a much more interesting subject than what they went with. Throw in how quick the titular and pivotal scene is and the movie is simultaneously plodding and rushed. And the jarring back and forth between her second choice of Stingo or Nathan. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I got whiplash in the back and forth. I can see from her background how that might have happened. I have trouble seeing from Stingo's point of view why he'd expect anything different.

    When i watched Sophies choice it was for physcology class, and I was looking at it from a physc point of view. I had no knowledge as to what it was about before i watched it other than that it had to do with a woman who was in a concentration camp. In watching this movie it was very capturing, Sophie just seemed like a typical woman who had a fight with her boyfriend but as it got further in you could see something about her lover was just not right he was very happy one minute the next he was accusing Sophie of having romance with Stingo a young writer who lived a floor below them and became very good friends with Both Nathan Sophies lover and Sophie herself. As Stingo becomes close to Sophie he starts to find out things from her past in the Camps that not even Nathan knows. There is more to it but something u would have to watch.

    History seems to me like a book where every single chapter is written under the traumatic effect of the previous one. To better understand Nazism's rise, one must understand the trauma of the 1918 Armistice on German people BUT to comprehend the French diktat of Versailles in 1919, one must also take into consideration the trauma of the French defeat against the Prussian Army in 1870. Following the same logic, History is the never-ending chronicles of successive traumas turning yesterday's losers into today's winners. But blood sometimes dries quicker than History books' ink, and while we're allowed to judge an event in a more rational and reasonable way, it leads to a very singular paradox: if you deprive your analysis from its emotional substance, you get more objective, rational, yet it can undermine your very comprehension of further events, because men make the events, and most of the times, they're guided by the weight of a traumatic experience -every act of terror takes its roots in another one- but then, if you use emotion, you lose the objectivity, which is the key element in science. To put it in simpler words: one death is a tragedy, one million is statistics, statistics are more relevant to understand the present but only tragedy can help to anticipate the future. A film like "Sophie's Choice" focuses on one tragedy to better highlight the gravity of a much more large-scaled tragic chapter of Human history: the Holocaust and its profound effect on people's minds. The world indeed would never be the same after 1945. But I'm still perplexed about the film. It tells the story of a young woman who survived the atrocities of the Concentration Camps and had to make one of the most horrific choices that was ever allowed to a mother: choosing which of her children would survive. The irony is that she's given this very privilege because she's not Jewish, she's a Catholic and what's more, not a communist, yet she would have to live with a terrible weight in her conscience, something that a Jewish mother wouldn't have to endure because she would be forced to lose her children. Another irony occurs when we discover Sophie's romance with Nathan, an American Jew, we're shocked seeing treated her as a whore for Germans, no matter how sick or demented he was. As I said, it's only through shock that you can comprehend the atrocity of an event. That Nathan carried this pain in his heritage because he was a Jew is one thing but it would be insulting to those who really lived the experience, to distribute the share of guilt and sorrow in the hearts of people who didn't live it, regardless of their ethnic background. So, I'm trying to figure out what the clear purpose of Sophie's story is? I try to imagine what was Alan J. Pakula's thinking when he decided to make the film. He probably thought that it would be great to have a film depicting one of the most horrific and painful dilemmas ever, carried by a marvelous performance from Meryl Streep, who was in her path for cinematic glory. Then, she'd have to tell her story in flashback, because the choice would only work if it came late in a film, to let us sense a trauma hidden inside her heart. But something must provoke the confession; it must be about children, then Stingo, the young idealistic writer, played by Peter MacNicol must ask Sophie for marrying her. Step by step, we get to the necessity of featuring this sort of triangular love between three friends, Nathan, Sophie's lover, Sophie, a Polish Auschwitz survivor with a lovable accent, and the sweet and naive Southern boy who'll naturally fall in love with them, mirroring their very passion for American literature. The promise of the film is carried by three spectacular performances and a sweet and tender score, but I failed to connect the story to the flashbacks and I wonder what the results would have been if the story was simply about Sophie's experience. The movie is guided by Nathan's weird behavior, Sophie's attempts to speak the most correct English, and Stingo's passive observations, the whole thing enrobed by a sort of back-story involving a passion for English and literature. The feelings driven by these parts go from amusing to infuriating, we're touched by Stingo's sweetness, frustrated by Nathan's lunacy and impressed or not by Meryl Streep's remarkable performance. There's a sort of lightness floating in the air that efficiently contrasts with the darkness of the flashback, but when the flashback started, I felt the weakness of the first hour and half that immediately felt like an overlong set-up and made me wonder what was so special to make this film in the American Film Institute's Top 100? One spectacular moment can redeem a whole film  or is it just because it's a Holocaust story  or a coming of age story of a kid who discovered the world's sudden cruelty from Sophie's trauma? Hadn't he heard about writers like Sartre or Camus who expressed their angst toward a world that allowed the Holocaust to happen and accept the idea of a Nuclear bomb wiping out Japanese civilians? To the choice, yes, it remains one of the most heart-breaking moments in cinema's history as I was haunted by the genuinely frightened look of Sophie's daughter and her piercing cries while she was taken in the misty dark under the powerless look of Sophie. Yes, Meryl Streep deserved the Award for that very part. But the rest belonged to another film, and instead of making another 'Holocaust' story, which I'm sure, would have been extraordinary, I trust Pakula's talent for that. He chose the option of a character study but he thinks too much of us on that level, because all the intelligibility of the world can't get over the shock deeply rooted in the experience.

    When Meryl Streep's Sophie slowly discloses her holocaust experience to Peter MacNicol's Stingo I literally felt I was witnessing the entire experience first-hand. Have I had such an experience with any other actor? No, I never have. Part of the credit goes to Alan Pakula for representing the event starkly but a majority of the effort is from Streep who can be termed as the 'best storyteller in the world'. &nbsp;I could sense her caliber in Out of Africa when she importunes the Governor to help the Africans and during the courtroom scene in Kramer vs Kramer, but only in Sophie's Choice could I see no Meryl but a completely different person by the name of Sophie Zawistowska. But that was also the case with Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot, but Meryl, in my opinion, had such a difficult character to portray that to achieve the effect of transporting the audience into Sophie's world without faltering any moment is the pinnacle of the state 'I am' in acting. &nbsp;Some say she her Polish/German/Broken English accent and diction weren't believable enough; my only advice to them is - try perfecting a foreign accent in 3 months yourself. On top of that, Meryl had to transcend Sophie on to the screen, not just with the accents, but with gestures, movements&nbsp;and more importantly, feelings. And Sophie has probably the saddest fate a woman could have - she was married to fear, grief and loss, first during Holocaust and then after the event. Throughout her life, she has had to make choices, many against her conscience; not only the choice that gives the film it's name, but also others for example, in spite of loathing her father's ideals, she used her pure blood status to escape more misery. But the ghosts of her past slowly unravel when Stingo, a young simpleton author develops friendship with her and her lover, the volatile Nathan. And Meryl does all this with uttermost sincerity and spontaneity, never faking it even when she could have got away with it because many people fall for pretenses. &nbsp;I'll tell you about a play I had seen yesterday where one of the actors, as the situation was reaching it's climax, began screaming his lines out as if stung on the rear by a bee. &nbsp; The audience, to my dismay, was in raptures, with an old lady besides me commenting "Superb performance" and I was like " O these audiences can be tricked so easily!". So there may be people who find Meryl's performance to be 'dull' at first, and it is because they believe only an external representation of emotions is enough. I request these people to surrender themselves to Sophie, rather than thinking about how she could have cried buckets instead of just one teardrop to show that she was sad. The character is embodied so completely that I may not be able to endure Sophie's misery again. The choice scene, when watched during the film, is a million times more painful than watching the four minute clip separately on YouTube. The most powerful performance I have witnessed by an actor or actress. Kline and MacNicol have a hard time measuring up to her, but in a way, they gave better performance because of the support they got from Streep's performance. Kline is theatrical but his act suits his character well at times. MacNicol doesn't fail but he neither succeeds in fully justifying his difficult character. The supporting cast, mostly consisting of Germans give authentic performances, the best one coming from the little girl playing Sophie's child, the Nazi officer and the German officer's daughter. The background score is haunting and perfectly placed in the scenes. &nbsp;I frankly wanted more much Sophie and could do without that young coarse lady who had a short-lived romance with Stingo. It was an extraordinary experience watching Meryl acting as a medium for Sophie Zawistowska and a harrowing one to see Sophie's misery. My Rating: 9 out of 10

    Sophie's Choice is one of those films I always meant to watch, and finally got the chance. It is best to go into it with as little idea as to what it's about as possible, as it's a slow film with a lot of layers that get peeled off one by one. A young would-be-author from the South moves to Brooklyn and befriends his neighbors, the couple Nathan and Sophie. All three hit it off, but Nathan's bipolar tendencies do puncture their friendship at times. Sophie, however, is a calm soul as kind as she is tortured by her past in Auschwitz. As the author, Stingo, gets to know them better, he is also taken deeper and deeper into Sophie's past, where a hidden pain resides. Sophie's Choice brilliantly captures two polar opposite worlds. The colourful and tranquil Brooklyn is contrasted strikingly by a late 1930s Poland occupied by Nazis, where the colour drains so much out of the film that any further and it would be black-and-white. The present in Brooklyn is a good haven to have and catch our breath between glimpses into Sophie's horrible past. At the end of the day, in spite of the emotionally shattering story, Sophie's Choice is a story about hope and redemption. The performances certainly helped. Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline are both wonderful as polar opposite personalities, united by a common love for literature. But Meryl Streep is utterly mesmerizing as Sophie. It's not for no reason that this was one of those Oscar-nominated performances of hers that gave that extra edge and got her the statue. All of Sophie's mannerisms, her accent, her speaking German and Polish, her searching for words in English to express what she wants to say, her restrained kindness, her pain; none of it overdone. The director even trusted Streep enough to take long shots with her as she gets into deep characterization. This is quite simply one of the finest female performances in cinema. I did fear, throughout the film, what exactly Sophie's choice was, and I was right, for it is a scene that crushes your heart. But the film comes together in the end and ends in an emotionally satisfying way in spite of everything. Steel yourself for an emotional journey and give Sophie's Choice a view, it's a film as uplifting as it is depressing, and unmissable for cinema buffs.

    the novel. the director. and the cast. result - memorable movie. or, only, a gem. not only for grace of adaptation. or for magnificent performance of Meryl Streep. but for precise form of an universal message. for the memories of viewer. for the shadow of words and gestures. in fact, it is one of films who, after its end, becomes an experience. aesthetic, emotional and , in same time, a map more than a lesson to understand the life as a chain of profound choices, cruel sacrifices. it is difficult to write a good review. because essential is out of words. because images, the small gestures, the art of each actor, the accent of Sophie are details who gives to entire film soul. a fragile soul. must see it ! for be more rich in the exploration of every day nuances.

    The only bit of information about her on IMDb reads: "Attended Tulane University" (the field of study is not even hinted at...). Under her Filmography, there is only one title: "Sophie's Choice"... This is all that remains from a very impressive performance of 1982 by a little girl whose name was Jennifer Lawn. Those who first saw the famous "choice" scene toward the end of the film, where the Academy Award winner Meryl Streep was holding terrified little Jennifer in her arms, must have foreseen a bright future for this kid actress who might easily fool the viewers into believing that she was actually living the scene, rather than just acting it! "A future Oscar winner in the arms of a present one", one might have prophesied back in 1982. Unfortunately, this prophecy never came true... If you have seen the movie, you are certainly familiar with this intensely dramatic scene (DON'T watch it if you have NOT seen the film and plan to do so!): costas-music.blogspot.gr/2012/12/sophies-choice-choice-scene.html

    Sophie's Choice is a drama film that tells the story of a Polish immigrant, Sophie, and her tempestuous lover who share a boarding house with a young writer in Brooklyn. The film stars Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Peter MacNicol. Alan J. Pakula directed the movie and wrote the script from a novel by William Styron of the same title. Aspiring southern author Stingo (MacNichol) heads to New York to seek his fortune. Moving into a dingy Brooklyn boarding house, Stingo strikes up a friendship with research chemist Nathan Landau (Kline) and Nathan's girlfriend, Polish refugee Sophie Zawistowska (Streep). There is something unsettling about the relationship; Nathan is subject to violent mood swings, while Sophie seems to be harboring a horrible secret. Stingo soon learns that both Nathan and Sophie are strangers to truth. One evening, Stingo learns from Sophie that she was married but her husband and her father were killed in a German work camp and that she was interned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Nathan is constantly jealous, and when he is in one of his violent mood swings he convinces himself that Sophie is unfaithful to him and abuses and harasses her. There is a flashback showing Nathan rescuing Sophie from near death from anemia shortly after her immigration to the U.S. Sophie eventually reveals that her father was a Nazi sympathizer. Sophie had a lover, J&oacute;zef, who lived with his half-sister, Wanda, a leader in the Resistance. Wanda tried to convince Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but Sophie declined, fearing she might endanger her children. Two weeks later J&oacute;zef was murdered by the Gestapo, and Sophie was arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children. She reveals to him the tragic choice she was forced to make at Auschwitz. Upon arrival, she was forced to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp. To avoid having both children killed, she chose her son, Jan, to be sent to the children's camp, and her daughter, Eva, to be sent to her death in Crematorium Two. The movie is too Hollywood in look and feel, and the flashback and narration are too conventional, and yet the image of the sickly and pale Meryl Streep recollecting her ordeal lingers in memory long after the film is over. Streep is memorable as Sophie which makes her truly deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actress that she won for this movie. Though it's far from a flawless movie, it is a unified and deeply affecting movie due in part due Streep's performance and the story just takes over and happens to you. It's quite an experience.

    I had heard so much good about this movie, that now when I finally came round to see it 30 years after everybody else, I found it a bit of a disappointment. It is not until the last twenty minutes that it gets really interesting. Most of the time it is slow and boring. Also, I cannot really relate to the character of Sophie. Yes, the choice she had to do was terrible. But one has to remember, that WWII was an awful time for everybody. She was not the only one who lost a child, so to speak. But most people got their act together after the war, and went on with life. I know something of this, because of what my parents have told me from the war. My father (who was Swedish) was a young soldier then, and he lay in preparedness at the Norwegian border, in case the Germans would try to invade Sweden. This meant great suffering, as the temperature was sometimes -42 degrees C. Several of his friends lost fingers and toes to the cold, and once my father was near to succumb in a snow-storm when he had gone astray on skis on the snowy mountain. And my mother, who is Finnish, had it even worse. The Finns were at war with the Russians, my grand-father fell in this war, and my grand-mother had to try to support her four children herself. They were actually starving one winter, and they got down in various diseases - my mother for instance had diphtheria, and the Doctor told her afterward that she had been very close to death. No one in my mother's family actually died though, because of my grand-mother's great courage and wisdom. And YES I realize you cannot really compare a concentration camp and a choice like Sophie's with my parents' experiences during the war - but it is still a matter of degrees. And of attitude - and courage. I think what redeems this movie, is Stingo's (the young author) ongoing comments to the events. Because he has such a very beautiful and poetic language, and such a healthy and positive attitude to life "after all", that shines through. He is the opposite of Sophie's and Nathan's decadence, strangeness, unhealthiness, depression and black outlook on life. One can imagine, that he would really go on to become a great writer after the events in the movie..!

    Alan Pakula directs "Sophie's Choice", adapted from a William Styron novel by the same name. Both were released in the wake of the NBC miniseries "Holocaust" (1978), which rekindled mainstream interest in the Final solution. Highly melodramatic, the film's first half revolves around the tribulations of the Polish Catholic Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep), who has left Post-War Europe for life in Brooklyn, New York. Here she lives with the volatile Nathan Landau (Kevin Kline), a Jewish con man who suffers from schizophrenia. Landau is abusive toward Sophie, plays power games with her, and suspects that Sophia may have betrayed Jews or sided with the Nazis in return for her own personal safety. Both Landau and Sophie are enveloped by self hate; Sophie tortures herself because she did indeed have a secret relationship with the Nazis, whilst Landau literally embodies a kind of Jewish survivor's guilt. The tale's title initially seems to refer to a choice Sophie must make in the present, choosing between one of two lovers, Landau or a young writer called Stingo, but is eventually revealed to be a reference to a past choice given to Sophie by a Nazi officer. His ultimatum? Sophie must choose which of her two children will be killed, lest they both are. Sophie's choice  her giving up of her son  is just one psychic scar carried by the woman throughout the film; her father was a eugenicist who advocated the extermination of Jews. Styron's tale is different from most Holocaust narratives. He focuses on Christians and Slavs (the Holocaust was anti-Christian as well as anti-Semitic) and like Lumet's "The Pawnbroker", a Jew is explicitly one of the tale's key bullies. The film and the novel also differ wildly. A large portion of Styron's novel - completely absent in the film - focuses on white-on-black racism, the American South and the slave trade, and subscribed to a view which Holocaust professor Richard Rubenstein says "rejects Christian anti-Semitism as causative" in favour for the belief that "in its essential character Auschwitz was a capitalistic slave society as much as or even more than it was an extermination centre". The novel also continuously jostles Sophie's first person narratives, Stingo's POV and an omniscient narrator. The overall effect is such that the viewpoints of victims and executioners become blurred or fused together. Styron's story is also structured such that multiple narrators find themselves selfishly warring over both Sophie's body and her story, desperate to claim her "victimization" for themselves. Shades of Egoyan's "Ararat" (a more overtly "postmodern" Holocaust story, in which different tribes literally attempt to co-opt the past for themselves). Interestingly, Nathan, a kind of Doppelg&auml;nger of German sadists, is himself a Jewish Nazi, whilst the Nazi officer who forces Sophie to choose between her children is himself given an early speech in which he bemoans having to play God, a weight which he eventually grants Sophie; he allows her to also play executioner. Both Nathan and the Nazi are creatures of the "grey zone", a concept developed by Primo Levi and further elaborated upon by Giorgio Agamben. For both, the grey zone refers to the blurring of boundaries between victims and executioners, and to the murky process of contamination and collaboration by which relationships within the death camps defied any simplistic Manichaean division of good and evil, imposing instead a condition of extreme equivocation (typically in the form of double binds or impossible situations). The zone is a kind of threshold of indistinction, which calls into question the very notion of ethics. Pakula may never go down as a great director, but he was interesting in the way, like Kubrick, he tended to focus on power, conspiracy and power's reliance on double-binds and no win scenarios. Like Warren Beatty in Pakula's "Parallax View", who becomes enshrined in the Law he attempts to remain apart of and/or destroy, Sophie can't help but be complicit. Incidentally, the choice Sophie faces is known as The Double Trolley Problem, a famous thought experiment in cognitive science, neuro-ethics and philosophy. The problem typically involves a subject being given a choice between either allowing 2 trolleys to run over and so kill 2 separate people, or attaching one trolley to another so that only one person dies. The answer to the problem differs depending on whichever branch of philosophy one belongs to. A utilitarian, for example, would typically always save one person. Other schools believe that making the choice is itself an unethical act; had you not intervened, the ethical breech (making the choice to deliberately kill) does not fall on you. When confronted with this problem in surveys, most people instinctively refuse to choose, perceiving "choosing" as being a complicit and "unethical" act. When presented with the choice between photos of loved ones (who will hypothetically die), people overwhelmingly tend to refuse to make the choice as well. According to studies, this is true for over 90 percent of human beings. The less than 10 percent who make utilitarian choices display strong tendencies toward psychopathy, Machiavellianism or tend to view life as being intrinsically meaningless. The film is handsomely shot, but is overly slow and Pakula's use of the Stingo character  a literary device not necessarily needed on film  goes nowhere. The way the film manipulates us into a state of artificial suspense (what is the choice? Who does Sophie choose?) is somewhat tasteless, Pakula's delaying of "the choice" and making it "the final solution" to a mystery echoing the Nazi's manipulating and dismissing of Sophie's humanity. Meryl Streep's acting here is praised, but its overly busy and virtuosic. It's the kind of flashy acting  all surfaces and no depth - that always wins awards; Pakula should have reigned her in. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    I feel like I was sold a bill of goods. The first half of this movie was not what I came to see. And most of the last quarter for that matter. I think the movie would work much better with a basic framework like Saving Private Ryan. Set me up in the present but let the body of the movie deal with the past. That's a much more interesting subject than what they went with. Throw in how quick the titular and pivotal scene is and the movie is simultaneously plodding and rushed. And the jarring back and forth between her second choice of Stingo or Nathan. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I got whiplash in the back and forth. I can see from her background how that might have happened. I have trouble seeing from Stingo's point of view why he'd expect anything different.

    When i watched Sophies choice it was for physcology class, and I was looking at it from a physc point of view. I had no knowledge as to what it was about before i watched it other than that it had to do with a woman who was in a concentration camp. In watching this movie it was very capturing, Sophie just seemed like a typical woman who had a fight with her boyfriend but as it got further in you could see something about her lover was just not right he was very happy one minute the next he was accusing Sophie of having romance with Stingo a young writer who lived a floor below them and became very good friends with Both Nathan Sophies lover and Sophie herself. As Stingo becomes close to Sophie he starts to find out things from her past in the Camps that not even Nathan knows. There is more to it but something u would have to watch.

    History seems to me like a book where every single chapter is written under the traumatic effect of the previous one. To better understand Nazism's rise, one must understand the trauma of the 1918 Armistice on German people BUT to comprehend the French diktat of Versailles in 1919, one must also take into consideration the trauma of the French defeat against the Prussian Army in 1870. Following the same logic, History is the never-ending chronicles of successive traumas turning yesterday's losers into today's winners. But blood sometimes dries quicker than History books' ink, and while we're allowed to judge an event in a more rational and reasonable way, it leads to a very singular paradox: if you deprive your analysis from its emotional substance, you get more objective, rational, yet it can undermine your very comprehension of further events, because men make the events, and most of the times, they're guided by the weight of a traumatic experience -every act of terror takes its roots in another one- but then, if you use emotion, you lose the objectivity, which is the key element in science. To put it in simpler words: one death is a tragedy, one million is statistics, statistics are more relevant to understand the present but only tragedy can help to anticipate the future. A film like "Sophie's Choice" focuses on one tragedy to better highlight the gravity of a much more large-scaled tragic chapter of Human history: the Holocaust and its profound effect on people's minds. The world indeed would never be the same after 1945. But I'm still perplexed about the film. It tells the story of a young woman who survived the atrocities of the Concentration Camps and had to make one of the most horrific choices that was ever allowed to a mother: choosing which of her children would survive. The irony is that she's given this very privilege because she's not Jewish, she's a Catholic and what's more, not a communist, yet she would have to live with a terrible weight in her conscience, something that a Jewish mother wouldn't have to endure because she would be forced to lose her children. Another irony occurs when we discover Sophie's romance with Nathan, an American Jew, we're shocked seeing treated her as a whore for Germans, no matter how sick or demented he was. As I said, it's only through shock that you can comprehend the atrocity of an event. That Nathan carried this pain in his heritage because he was a Jew is one thing but it would be insulting to those who really lived the experience, to distribute the share of guilt and sorrow in the hearts of people who didn't live it, regardless of their ethnic background. So, I'm trying to figure out what the clear purpose of Sophie's story is? I try to imagine what was Alan J. Pakula's thinking when he decided to make the film. He probably thought that it would be great to have a film depicting one of the most horrific and painful dilemmas ever, carried by a marvelous performance from Meryl Streep, who was in her path for cinematic glory. Then, she'd have to tell her story in flashback, because the choice would only work if it came late in a film, to let us sense a trauma hidden inside her heart. But something must provoke the confession; it must be about children, then Stingo, the young idealistic writer, played by Peter MacNicol must ask Sophie for marrying her. Step by step, we get to the necessity of featuring this sort of triangular love between three friends, Nathan, Sophie's lover, Sophie, a Polish Auschwitz survivor with a lovable accent, and the sweet and naive Southern boy who'll naturally fall in love with them, mirroring their very passion for American literature. The promise of the film is carried by three spectacular performances and a sweet and tender score, but I failed to connect the story to the flashbacks and I wonder what the results would have been if the story was simply about Sophie's experience. The movie is guided by Nathan's weird behavior, Sophie's attempts to speak the most correct English, and Stingo's passive observations, the whole thing enrobed by a sort of back-story involving a passion for English and literature. The feelings driven by these parts go from amusing to infuriating, we're touched by Stingo's sweetness, frustrated by Nathan's lunacy and impressed or not by Meryl Streep's remarkable performance. There's a sort of lightness floating in the air that efficiently contrasts with the darkness of the flashback, but when the flashback started, I felt the weakness of the first hour and half that immediately felt like an overlong set-up and made me wonder what was so special to make this film in the American Film Institute's Top 100? One spectacular moment can redeem a whole film  or is it just because it's a Holocaust story  or a coming of age story of a kid who discovered the world's sudden cruelty from Sophie's trauma? Hadn't he heard about writers like Sartre or Camus who expressed their angst toward a world that allowed the Holocaust to happen and accept the idea of a Nuclear bomb wiping out Japanese civilians? To the choice, yes, it remains one of the most heart-breaking moments in cinema's history as I was haunted by the genuinely frightened look of Sophie's daughter and her piercing cries while she was taken in the misty dark under the powerless look of Sophie. Yes, Meryl Streep deserved the Award for that very part. But the rest belonged to another film, and instead of making another 'Holocaust' story, which I'm sure, would have been extraordinary, I trust Pakula's talent for that. He chose the option of a character study but he thinks too much of us on that level, because all the intelligibility of the world can't get over the shock deeply rooted in the experience.

    When Meryl Streep's Sophie slowly discloses her holocaust experience to Peter MacNicol's Stingo I literally felt I was witnessing the entire experience first-hand. Have I had such an experience with any other actor? No, I never have. Part of the credit goes to Alan Pakula for representing the event starkly but a majority of the effort is from Streep who can be termed as the 'best storyteller in the world'. &nbsp;I could sense her caliber in Out of Africa when she importunes the Governor to help the Africans and during the courtroom scene in Kramer vs Kramer, but only in Sophie's Choice could I see no Meryl but a completely different person by the name of Sophie Zawistowska. But that was also the case with Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot, but Meryl, in my opinion, had such a difficult character to portray that to achieve the effect of transporting the audience into Sophie's world without faltering any moment is the pinnacle of the state 'I am' in acting. &nbsp;Some say she her Polish/German/Broken English accent and diction weren't believable enough; my only advice to them is - try perfecting a foreign accent in 3 months yourself. On top of that, Meryl had to transcend Sophie on to the screen, not just with the accents, but with gestures, movements&nbsp;and more importantly, feelings. And Sophie has probably the saddest fate a woman could have - she was married to fear, grief and loss, first during Holocaust and then after the event. Throughout her life, she has had to make choices, many against her conscience; not only the choice that gives the film it's name, but also others for example, in spite of loathing her father's ideals, she used her pure blood status to escape more misery. But the ghosts of her past slowly unravel when Stingo, a young simpleton author develops friendship with her and her lover, the volatile Nathan. And Meryl does all this with uttermost sincerity and spontaneity, never faking it even when she could have got away with it because many people fall for pretenses. &nbsp;I'll tell you about a play I had seen yesterday where one of the actors, as the situation was reaching it's climax, began screaming his lines out as if stung on the rear by a bee. &nbsp; The audience, to my dismay, was in raptures, with an old lady besides me commenting "Superb performance" and I was like " O these audiences can be tricked so easily!". So there may be people who find Meryl's performance to be 'dull' at first, and it is because they believe only an external representation of emotions is enough. I request these people to surrender themselves to Sophie, rather than thinking about how she could have cried buckets instead of just one teardrop to show that she was sad. The character is embodied so completely that I may not be able to endure Sophie's misery again. The choice scene, when watched during the film, is a million times more painful than watching the four minute clip separately on YouTube. The most powerful performance I have witnessed by an actor or actress. Kline and MacNicol have a hard time measuring up to her, but in a way, they gave better performance because of the support they got from Streep's performance. Kline is theatrical but his act suits his character well at times. MacNicol doesn't fail but he neither succeeds in fully justifying his difficult character. The supporting cast, mostly consisting of Germans give authentic performances, the best one coming from the little girl playing Sophie's child, the Nazi officer and the German officer's daughter. The background score is haunting and perfectly placed in the scenes. &nbsp;I frankly wanted more much Sophie and could do without that young coarse lady who had a short-lived romance with Stingo. It was an extraordinary experience watching Meryl acting as a medium for Sophie Zawistowska and a harrowing one to see Sophie's misery. My Rating: 9 out of 10

    Sophie's Choice is one of those films I always meant to watch, and finally got the chance. It is best to go into it with as little idea as to what it's about as possible, as it's a slow film with a lot of layers that get peeled off one by one. A young would-be-author from the South moves to Brooklyn and befriends his neighbors, the couple Nathan and Sophie. All three hit it off, but Nathan's bipolar tendencies do puncture their friendship at times. Sophie, however, is a calm soul as kind as she is tortured by her past in Auschwitz. As the author, Stingo, gets to know them better, he is also taken deeper and deeper into Sophie's past, where a hidden pain resides. Sophie's Choice brilliantly captures two polar opposite worlds. The colourful and tranquil Brooklyn is contrasted strikingly by a late 1930s Poland occupied by Nazis, where the colour drains so much out of the film that any further and it would be black-and-white. The present in Brooklyn is a good haven to have and catch our breath between glimpses into Sophie's horrible past. At the end of the day, in spite of the emotionally shattering story, Sophie's Choice is a story about hope and redemption. The performances certainly helped. Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline are both wonderful as polar opposite personalities, united by a common love for literature. But Meryl Streep is utterly mesmerizing as Sophie. It's not for no reason that this was one of those Oscar-nominated performances of hers that gave that extra edge and got her the statue. All of Sophie's mannerisms, her accent, her speaking German and Polish, her searching for words in English to express what she wants to say, her restrained kindness, her pain; none of it overdone. The director even trusted Streep enough to take long shots with her as she gets into deep characterization. This is quite simply one of the finest female performances in cinema. I did fear, throughout the film, what exactly Sophie's choice was, and I was right, for it is a scene that crushes your heart. But the film comes together in the end and ends in an emotionally satisfying way in spite of everything. Steel yourself for an emotional journey and give Sophie's Choice a view, it's a film as uplifting as it is depressing, and unmissable for cinema buffs.

    the novel. the director. and the cast. result - memorable movie. or, only, a gem. not only for grace of adaptation. or for magnificent performance of Meryl Streep. but for precise form of an universal message. for the memories of viewer. for the shadow of words and gestures. in fact, it is one of films who, after its end, becomes an experience. aesthetic, emotional and , in same time, a map more than a lesson to understand the life as a chain of profound choices, cruel sacrifices. it is difficult to write a good review. because essential is out of words. because images, the small gestures, the art of each actor, the accent of Sophie are details who gives to entire film soul. a fragile soul. must see it ! for be more rich in the exploration of every day nuances.

    The only bit of information about her on IMDb reads: "Attended Tulane University" (the field of study is not even hinted at...). Under her Filmography, there is only one title: "Sophie's Choice"... This is all that remains from a very impressive performance of 1982 by a little girl whose name was Jennifer Lawn. Those who first saw the famous "choice" scene toward the end of the film, where the Academy Award winner Meryl Streep was holding terrified little Jennifer in her arms, must have foreseen a bright future for this kid actress who might easily fool the viewers into believing that she was actually living the scene, rather than just acting it! "A future Oscar winner in the arms of a present one", one might have prophesied back in 1982. Unfortunately, this prophecy never came true... If you have seen the movie, you are certainly familiar with this intensely dramatic scene (DON'T watch it if you have NOT seen the film and plan to do so!): costas-music.blogspot.gr/2012/12/sophies-choice-choice-scene.html

    Sophie's Choice is a drama film that tells the story of a Polish immigrant, Sophie, and her tempestuous lover who share a boarding house with a young writer in Brooklyn. The film stars Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Peter MacNicol. Alan J. Pakula directed the movie and wrote the script from a novel by William Styron of the same title. Aspiring southern author Stingo (MacNichol) heads to New York to seek his fortune. Moving into a dingy Brooklyn boarding house, Stingo strikes up a friendship with research chemist Nathan Landau (Kline) and Nathan's girlfriend, Polish refugee Sophie Zawistowska (Streep). There is something unsettling about the relationship; Nathan is subject to violent mood swings, while Sophie seems to be harboring a horrible secret. Stingo soon learns that both Nathan and Sophie are strangers to truth. One evening, Stingo learns from Sophie that she was married but her husband and her father were killed in a German work camp and that she was interned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Nathan is constantly jealous, and when he is in one of his violent mood swings he convinces himself that Sophie is unfaithful to him and abuses and harasses her. There is a flashback showing Nathan rescuing Sophie from near death from anemia shortly after her immigration to the U.S. Sophie eventually reveals that her father was a Nazi sympathizer. Sophie had a lover, J&oacute;zef, who lived with his half-sister, Wanda, a leader in the Resistance. Wanda tried to convince Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but Sophie declined, fearing she might endanger her children. Two weeks later J&oacute;zef was murdered by the Gestapo, and Sophie was arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children. She reveals to him the tragic choice she was forced to make at Auschwitz. Upon arrival, she was forced to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp. To avoid having both children killed, she chose her son, Jan, to be sent to the children's camp, and her daughter, Eva, to be sent to her death in Crematorium Two. The movie is too Hollywood in look and feel, and the flashback and narration are too conventional, and yet the image of the sickly and pale Meryl Streep recollecting her ordeal lingers in memory long after the film is over. Streep is memorable as Sophie which makes her truly deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actress that she won for this movie. Though it's far from a flawless movie, it is a unified and deeply affecting movie due in part due Streep's performance and the story just takes over and happens to you. It's quite an experience.

    I had heard so much good about this movie, that now when I finally came round to see it 30 years after everybody else, I found it a bit of a disappointment. It is not until the last twenty minutes that it gets really interesting. Most of the time it is slow and boring. Also, I cannot really relate to the character of Sophie. Yes, the choice she had to do was terrible. But one has to remember, that WWII was an awful time for everybody. She was not the only one who lost a child, so to speak. But most people got their act together after the war, and went on with life. I know something of this, because of what my parents have told me from the war. My father (who was Swedish) was a young soldier then, and he lay in preparedness at the Norwegian border, in case the Germans would try to invade Sweden. This meant great suffering, as the temperature was sometimes -42 degrees C. Several of his friends lost fingers and toes to the cold, and once my father was near to succumb in a snow-storm when he had gone astray on skis on the snowy mountain. And my mother, who is Finnish, had it even worse. The Finns were at war with the Russians, my grand-father fell in this war, and my grand-mother had to try to support her four children herself. They were actually starving one winter, and they got down in various diseases - my mother for instance had diphtheria, and the Doctor told her afterward that she had been very close to death. No one in my mother's family actually died though, because of my grand-mother's great courage and wisdom. And YES I realize you cannot really compare a concentration camp and a choice like Sophie's with my parents' experiences during the war - but it is still a matter of degrees. And of attitude - and courage. I think what redeems this movie, is Stingo's (the young author) ongoing comments to the events. Because he has such a very beautiful and poetic language, and such a healthy and positive attitude to life "after all", that shines through. He is the opposite of Sophie's and Nathan's decadence, strangeness, unhealthiness, depression and black outlook on life. One can imagine, that he would really go on to become a great writer after the events in the movie..!

    Alan Pakula directs "Sophie's Choice", adapted from a William Styron novel by the same name. Both were released in the wake of the NBC miniseries "Holocaust" (1978), which rekindled mainstream interest in the Final solution. Highly melodramatic, the film's first half revolves around the tribulations of the Polish Catholic Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep), who has left Post-War Europe for life in Brooklyn, New York. Here she lives with the volatile Nathan Landau (Kevin Kline), a Jewish con man who suffers from schizophrenia. Landau is abusive toward Sophie, plays power games with her, and suspects that Sophia may have betrayed Jews or sided with the Nazis in return for her own personal safety. Both Landau and Sophie are enveloped by self hate; Sophie tortures herself because she did indeed have a secret relationship with the Nazis, whilst Landau literally embodies a kind of Jewish survivor's guilt. The tale's title initially seems to refer to a choice Sophie must make in the present, choosing between one of two lovers, Landau or a young writer called Stingo, but is eventually revealed to be a reference to a past choice given to Sophie by a Nazi officer. His ultimatum? Sophie must choose which of her two children will be killed, lest they both are. Sophie's choice  her giving up of her son  is just one psychic scar carried by the woman throughout the film; her father was a eugenicist who advocated the extermination of Jews. Styron's tale is different from most Holocaust narratives. He focuses on Christians and Slavs (the Holocaust was anti-Christian as well as anti-Semitic) and like Lumet's "The Pawnbroker", a Jew is explicitly one of the tale's key bullies. The film and the novel also differ wildly. A large portion of Styron's novel - completely absent in the film - focuses on white-on-black racism, the American South and the slave trade, and subscribed to a view which Holocaust professor Richard Rubenstein says "rejects Christian anti-Semitism as causative" in favour for the belief that "in its essential character Auschwitz was a capitalistic slave society as much as or even more than it was an extermination centre". The novel also continuously jostles Sophie's first person narratives, Stingo's POV and an omniscient narrator. The overall effect is such that the viewpoints of victims and executioners become blurred or fused together. Styron's story is also structured such that multiple narrators find themselves selfishly warring over both Sophie's body and her story, desperate to claim her "victimization" for themselves. Shades of Egoyan's "Ararat" (a more overtly "postmodern" Holocaust story, in which different tribes literally attempt to co-opt the past for themselves). Interestingly, Nathan, a kind of Doppelg&auml;nger of German sadists, is himself a Jewish Nazi, whilst the Nazi officer who forces Sophie to choose between her children is himself given an early speech in which he bemoans having to play God, a weight which he eventually grants Sophie; he allows her to also play executioner. Both Nathan and the Nazi are creatures of the "grey zone", a concept developed by Primo Levi and further elaborated upon by Giorgio Agamben. For both, the grey zone refers to the blurring of boundaries between victims and executioners, and to the murky process of contamination and collaboration by which relationships within the death camps defied any simplistic Manichaean division of good and evil, imposing instead a condition of extreme equivocation (typically in the form of double binds or impossible situations). The zone is a kind of threshold of indistinction, which calls into question the very notion of ethics. Pakula may never go down as a great director, but he was interesting in the way, like Kubrick, he tended to focus on power, conspiracy and power's reliance on double-binds and no win scenarios. Like Warren Beatty in Pakula's "Parallax View", who becomes enshrined in the Law he attempts to remain apart of and/or destroy, Sophie can't help but be complicit. Incidentally, the choice Sophie faces is known as The Double Trolley Problem, a famous thought experiment in cognitive science, neuro-ethics and philosophy. The problem typically involves a subject being given a choice between either allowing 2 trolleys to run over and so kill 2 separate people, or attaching one trolley to another so that only one person dies. The answer to the problem differs depending on whichever branch of philosophy one belongs to. A utilitarian, for example, would typically always save one person. Other schools believe that making the choice is itself an unethical act; had you not intervened, the ethical breech (making the choice to deliberately kill) does not fall on you. When confronted with this problem in surveys, most people instinctively refuse to choose, perceiving "choosing" as being a complicit and "unethical" act. When presented with the choice between photos of loved ones (who will hypothetically die), people overwhelmingly tend to refuse to make the choice as well. According to studies, this is true for over 90 percent of human beings. The less than 10 percent who make utilitarian choices display strong tendencies toward psychopathy, Machiavellianism or tend to view life as being intrinsically meaningless. The film is handsomely shot, but is overly slow and Pakula's use of the Stingo character  a literary device not necessarily needed on film  goes nowhere. The way the film manipulates us into a state of artificial suspense (what is the choice? Who does Sophie choose?) is somewhat tasteless, Pakula's delaying of "the choice" and making it "the final solution" to a mystery echoing the Nazi's manipulating and dismissing of Sophie's humanity. Meryl Streep's acting here is praised, but its overly busy and virtuosic. It's the kind of flashy acting  all surfaces and no depth - that always wins awards; Pakula should have reigned her in. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    I feel like I was sold a bill of goods. The first half of this movie was not what I came to see. And most of the last quarter for that matter. I think the movie would work much better with a basic framework like Saving Private Ryan. Set me up in the present but let the body of the movie deal with the past. That's a much more interesting subject than what they went with. Throw in how quick the titular and pivotal scene is and the movie is simultaneously plodding and rushed. And the jarring back and forth between her second choice of Stingo or Nathan. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I got whiplash in the back and forth. I can see from her background how that might have happened. I have trouble seeing from Stingo's point of view why he'd expect anything different.

    When i watched Sophies choice it was for physcology class, and I was looking at it from a physc point of view. I had no knowledge as to what it was about before i watched it other than that it had to do with a woman who was in a concentration camp. In watching this movie it was very capturing, Sophie just seemed like a typical woman who had a fight with her boyfriend but as it got further in you could see something about her lover was just not right he was very happy one minute the next he was accusing Sophie of having romance with Stingo a young writer who lived a floor below them and became very good friends with Both Nathan Sophies lover and Sophie herself. As Stingo becomes close to Sophie he starts to find out things from her past in the Camps that not even Nathan knows. There is more to it but something u would have to watch.

    History seems to me like a book where every single chapter is written under the traumatic effect of the previous one. To better understand Nazism's rise, one must understand the trauma of the 1918 Armistice on German people BUT to comprehend the French diktat of Versailles in 1919, one must also take into consideration the trauma of the French defeat against the Prussian Army in 1870. Following the same logic, History is the never-ending chronicles of successive traumas turning yesterday's losers into today's winners. But blood sometimes dries quicker than History books' ink, and while we're allowed to judge an event in a more rational and reasonable way, it leads to a very singular paradox: if you deprive your analysis from its emotional substance, you get more objective, rational, yet it can undermine your very comprehension of further events, because men make the events, and most of the times, they're guided by the weight of a traumatic experience -every act of terror takes its roots in another one- but then, if you use emotion, you lose the objectivity, which is the key element in science. To put it in simpler words: one death is a tragedy, one million is statistics, statistics are more relevant to understand the present but only tragedy can help to anticipate the future. A film like "Sophie's Choice" focuses on one tragedy to better highlight the gravity of a much more large-scaled tragic chapter of Human history: the Holocaust and its profound effect on people's minds. The world indeed would never be the same after 1945. But I'm still perplexed about the film. It tells the story of a young woman who survived the atrocities of the Concentration Camps and had to make one of the most horrific choices that was ever allowed to a mother: choosing which of her children would survive. The irony is that she's given this very privilege because she's not Jewish, she's a Catholic and what's more, not a communist, yet she would have to live with a terrible weight in her conscience, something that a Jewish mother wouldn't have to endure because she would be forced to lose her children. Another irony occurs when we discover Sophie's romance with Nathan, an American Jew, we're shocked seeing treated her as a whore for Germans, no matter how sick or demented he was. As I said, it's only through shock that you can comprehend the atrocity of an event. That Nathan carried this pain in his heritage because he was a Jew is one thing but it would be insulting to those who really lived the experience, to distribute the share of guilt and sorrow in the hearts of people who didn't live it, regardless of their ethnic background. So, I'm trying to figure out what the clear purpose of Sophie's story is? I try to imagine what was Alan J. Pakula's thinking when he decided to make the film. He probably thought that it would be great to have a film depicting one of the most horrific and painful dilemmas ever, carried by a marvelous performance from Meryl Streep, who was in her path for cinematic glory. Then, she'd have to tell her story in flashback, because the choice would only work if it came late in a film, to let us sense a trauma hidden inside her heart. But something must provoke the confession; it must be about children, then Stingo, the young idealistic writer, played by Peter MacNicol must ask Sophie for marrying her. Step by step, we get to the necessity of featuring this sort of triangular love between three friends, Nathan, Sophie's lover, Sophie, a Polish Auschwitz survivor with a lovable accent, and the sweet and naive Southern boy who'll naturally fall in love with them, mirroring their very passion for American literature. The promise of the film is carried by three spectacular performances and a sweet and tender score, but I failed to connect the story to the flashbacks and I wonder what the results would have been if the story was simply about Sophie's experience. The movie is guided by Nathan's weird behavior, Sophie's attempts to speak the most correct English, and Stingo's passive observations, the whole thing enrobed by a sort of back-story involving a passion for English and literature. The feelings driven by these parts go from amusing to infuriating, we're touched by Stingo's sweetness, frustrated by Nathan's lunacy and impressed or not by Meryl Streep's remarkable performance. There's a sort of lightness floating in the air that efficiently contrasts with the darkness of the flashback, but when the flashback started, I felt the weakness of the first hour and half that immediately felt like an overlong set-up and made me wonder what was so special to make this film in the American Film Institute's Top 100? One spectacular moment can redeem a whole film  or is it just because it's a Holocaust story  or a coming of age story of a kid who discovered the world's sudden cruelty from Sophie's trauma? Hadn't he heard about writers like Sartre or Camus who expressed their angst toward a world that allowed the Holocaust to happen and accept the idea of a Nuclear bomb wiping out Japanese civilians? To the choice, yes, it remains one of the most heart-breaking moments in cinema's history as I was haunted by the genuinely frightened look of Sophie's daughter and her piercing cries while she was taken in the misty dark under the powerless look of Sophie. Yes, Meryl Streep deserved the Award for that very part. But the rest belonged to another film, and instead of making another 'Holocaust' story, which I'm sure, would have been extraordinary, I trust Pakula's talent for that. He chose the option of a character study but he thinks too much of us on that level, because all the intelligibility of the world can't get over the shock deeply rooted in the experience.

    When Meryl Streep's Sophie slowly discloses her holocaust experience to Peter MacNicol's Stingo I literally felt I was witnessing the entire experience first-hand. Have I had such an experience with any other actor? No, I never have. Part of the credit goes to Alan Pakula for representing the event starkly but a majority of the effort is from Streep who can be termed as the 'best storyteller in the world'. &nbsp;I could sense her caliber in Out of Africa when she importunes the Governor to help the Africans and during the courtroom scene in Kramer vs Kramer, but only in Sophie's Choice could I see no Meryl but a completely different person by the name of Sophie Zawistowska. But that was also the case with Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot, but Meryl, in my opinion, had such a difficult character to portray that to achieve the effect of transporting the audience into Sophie's world without faltering any moment is the pinnacle of the state 'I am' in acting. &nbsp;Some say she her Polish/German/Broken English accent and diction weren't believable enough; my only advice to them is - try perfecting a foreign accent in 3 months yourself. On top of that, Meryl had to transcend Sophie on to the screen, not just with the accents, but with gestures, movements&nbsp;and more importantly, feelings. And Sophie has probably the saddest fate a woman could have - she was married to fear, grief and loss, first during Holocaust and then after the event. Throughout her life, she has had to make choices, many against her conscience; not only the choice that gives the film it's name, but also others for example, in spite of loathing her father's ideals, she used her pure blood status to escape more misery. But the ghosts of her past slowly unravel when Stingo, a young simpleton author develops friendship with her and her lover, the volatile Nathan. And Meryl does all this with uttermost sincerity and spontaneity, never faking it even when she could have got away with it because many people fall for pretenses. &nbsp;I'll tell you about a play I had seen yesterday where one of the actors, as the situation was reaching it's climax, began screaming his lines out as if stung on the rear by a bee. &nbsp; The audience, to my dismay, was in raptures, with an old lady besides me commenting "Superb performance" and I was like " O these audiences can be tricked so easily!". So there may be people who find Meryl's performance to be 'dull' at first, and it is because they believe only an external representation of emotions is enough. I request these people to surrender themselves to Sophie, rather than thinking about how she could have cried buckets instead of just one teardrop to show that she was sad. The character is embodied so completely that I may not be able to endure Sophie's misery again. The choice scene, when watched during the film, is a million times more painful than watching the four minute clip separately on YouTube. The most powerful performance I have witnessed by an actor or actress. Kline and MacNicol have a hard time measuring up to her, but in a way, they gave better performance because of the support they got from Streep's performance. Kline is theatrical but his act suits his character well at times. MacNicol doesn't fail but he neither succeeds in fully justifying his difficult character. The supporting cast, mostly consisting of Germans give authentic performances, the best one coming from the little girl playing Sophie's child, the Nazi officer and the German officer's daughter. The background score is haunting and perfectly placed in the scenes. &nbsp;I frankly wanted more much Sophie and could do without that young coarse lady who had a short-lived romance with Stingo. It was an extraordinary experience watching Meryl acting as a medium for Sophie Zawistowska and a harrowing one to see Sophie's misery. My Rating: 9 out of 10

    Sophie's Choice is one of those films I always meant to watch, and finally got the chance. It is best to go into it with as little idea as to what it's about as possible, as it's a slow film with a lot of layers that get peeled off one by one. A young would-be-author from the South moves to Brooklyn and befriends his neighbors, the couple Nathan and Sophie. All three hit it off, but Nathan's bipolar tendencies do puncture their friendship at times. Sophie, however, is a calm soul as kind as she is tortured by her past in Auschwitz. As the author, Stingo, gets to know them better, he is also taken deeper and deeper into Sophie's past, where a hidden pain resides. Sophie's Choice brilliantly captures two polar opposite worlds. The colourful and tranquil Brooklyn is contrasted strikingly by a late 1930s Poland occupied by Nazis, where the colour drains so much out of the film that any further and it would be black-and-white. The present in Brooklyn is a good haven to have and catch our breath between glimpses into Sophie's horrible past. At the end of the day, in spite of the emotionally shattering story, Sophie's Choice is a story about hope and redemption. The performances certainly helped. Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline are both wonderful as polar opposite personalities, united by a common love for literature. But Meryl Streep is utterly mesmerizing as Sophie. It's not for no reason that this was one of those Oscar-nominated performances of hers that gave that extra edge and got her the statue. All of Sophie's mannerisms, her accent, her speaking German and Polish, her searching for words in English to express what she wants to say, her restrained kindness, her pain; none of it overdone. The director even trusted Streep enough to take long shots with her as she gets into deep characterization. This is quite simply one of the finest female performances in cinema. I did fear, throughout the film, what exactly Sophie's choice was, and I was right, for it is a scene that crushes your heart. But the film comes together in the end and ends in an emotionally satisfying way in spite of everything. Steel yourself for an emotional journey and give Sophie's Choice a view, it's a film as uplifting as it is depressing, and unmissable for cinema buffs.

    The only bit of information about her on IMDb reads: "Attended Tulane University" (the field of study is not even hinted at...). Under her Filmography, there is only one title: "Sophie's Choice"... This is all that remains from a very impressive performance of 1982 by a little girl whose name was Jennifer Lawn. Those who first saw the famous "choice" scene toward the end of the film, where the Academy Award winner Meryl Streep was holding terrified little Jennifer in her arms, must have foreseen a bright future for this kid actress who might easily fool the viewers into believing that she was actually living the scene, rather than just acting it! "A future Oscar winner in the arms of a present one", one might have prophesied back in 1982. Unfortunately, this prophecy never came true... If you have seen the movie, you are certainly familiar with this intensely dramatic scene (DON'T watch it if you have NOT seen the film and plan to do so!): costas-music.blogspot.gr/2012/12/sophies-choice-choice-scene.html

    Sophie's Choice is a drama film that tells the story of a Polish immigrant, Sophie, and her tempestuous lover who share a boarding house with a young writer in Brooklyn. The film stars Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Peter MacNicol. Alan J. Pakula directed the movie and wrote the script from a novel by William Styron of the same title. Aspiring southern author Stingo (MacNichol) heads to New York to seek his fortune. Moving into a dingy Brooklyn boarding house, Stingo strikes up a friendship with research chemist Nathan Landau (Kline) and Nathan's girlfriend, Polish refugee Sophie Zawistowska (Streep). There is something unsettling about the relationship; Nathan is subject to violent mood swings, while Sophie seems to be harboring a horrible secret. Stingo soon learns that both Nathan and Sophie are strangers to truth. One evening, Stingo learns from Sophie that she was married but her husband and her father were killed in a German work camp and that she was interned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Nathan is constantly jealous, and when he is in one of his violent mood swings he convinces himself that Sophie is unfaithful to him and abuses and harasses her. There is a flashback showing Nathan rescuing Sophie from near death from anemia shortly after her immigration to the U.S. Sophie eventually reveals that her father was a Nazi sympathizer. Sophie had a lover, J&oacute;zef, who lived with his half-sister, Wanda, a leader in the Resistance. Wanda tried to convince Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but Sophie declined, fearing she might endanger her children. Two weeks later J&oacute;zef was murdered by the Gestapo, and Sophie was arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children. She reveals to him the tragic choice she was forced to make at Auschwitz. Upon arrival, she was forced to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp. To avoid having both children killed, she chose her son, Jan, to be sent to the children's camp, and her daughter, Eva, to be sent to her death in Crematorium Two. The movie is too Hollywood in look and feel, and the flashback and narration are too conventional, and yet the image of the sickly and pale Meryl Streep recollecting her ordeal lingers in memory long after the film is over. Streep is memorable as Sophie which makes her truly deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actress that she won for this movie. Though it's far from a flawless movie, it is a unified and deeply affecting movie due in part due Streep's performance and the story just takes over and happens to you. It's quite an experience.

    I had heard so much good about this movie, that now when I finally came round to see it 30 years after everybody else, I found it a bit of a disappointment. It is not until the last twenty minutes that it gets really interesting. Most of the time it is slow and boring. Also, I cannot really relate to the character of Sophie. Yes, the choice she had to do was terrible. But one has to remember, that WWII was an awful time for everybody. She was not the only one who lost a child, so to speak. But most people got their act together after the war, and went on with life. I know something of this, because of what my parents have told me from the war. My father (who was Swedish) was a young soldier then, and he lay in preparedness at the Norwegian border, in case the Germans would try to invade Sweden. This meant great suffering, as the temperature was sometimes -42 degrees C. Several of his friends lost fingers and toes to the cold, and once my father was near to succumb in a snow-storm when he had gone astray on skis on the snowy mountain. And my mother, who is Finnish, had it even worse. The Finns were at war with the Russians, my grand-father fell in this war, and my grand-mother had to try to support her four children herself. They were actually starving one winter, and they got down in various diseases - my mother for instance had diphtheria, and the Doctor told her afterward that she had been very close to death. No one in my mother's family actually died though, because of my grand-mother's great courage and wisdom. And YES I realize you cannot really compare a concentration camp and a choice like Sophie's with my parents' experiences during the war - but it is still a matter of degrees. And of attitude - and courage. I think what redeems this movie, is Stingo's (the young author) ongoing comments to the events. Because he has such a very beautiful and poetic language, and such a healthy and positive attitude to life "after all", that shines through. He is the opposite of Sophie's and Nathan's decadence, strangeness, unhealthiness, depression and black outlook on life. One can imagine, that he would really go on to become a great writer after the events in the movie..!

    Alan Pakula directs "Sophie's Choice", adapted from a William Styron novel by the same name. Both were released in the wake of the NBC miniseries "Holocaust" (1978), which rekindled mainstream interest in the Final solution. Highly melodramatic, the film's first half revolves around the tribulations of the Polish Catholic Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep), who has left Post-War Europe for life in Brooklyn, New York. Here she lives with the volatile Nathan Landau (Kevin Kline), a Jewish con man who suffers from schizophrenia. Landau is abusive toward Sophie, plays power games with her, and suspects that Sophia may have betrayed Jews or sided with the Nazis in return for her own personal safety. Both Landau and Sophie are enveloped by self hate; Sophie tortures herself because she did indeed have a secret relationship with the Nazis, whilst Landau literally embodies a kind of Jewish survivor's guilt. The tale's title initially seems to refer to a choice Sophie must make in the present, choosing between one of two lovers, Landau or a young writer called Stingo, but is eventually revealed to be a reference to a past choice given to Sophie by a Nazi officer. His ultimatum? Sophie must choose which of her two children will be killed, lest they both are. Sophie's choice  her giving up of her son  is just one psychic scar carried by the woman throughout the film; her father was a eugenicist who advocated the extermination of Jews. Styron's tale is different from most Holocaust narratives. He focuses on Christians and Slavs (the Holocaust was anti-Christian as well as anti-Semitic) and like Lumet's "The Pawnbroker", a Jew is explicitly one of the tale's key bullies. The film and the novel also differ wildly. A large portion of Styron's novel - completely absent in the film - focuses on white-on-black racism, the American South and the slave trade, and subscribed to a view which Holocaust professor Richard Rubenstein says "rejects Christian anti-Semitism as causative" in favour for the belief that "in its essential character Auschwitz was a capitalistic slave society as much as or even more than it was an extermination centre". The novel also continuously jostles Sophie's first person narratives, Stingo's POV and an omniscient narrator. The overall effect is such that the viewpoints of victims and executioners become blurred or fused together. Styron's story is also structured such that multiple narrators find themselves selfishly warring over both Sophie's body and her story, desperate to claim her "victimization" for themselves. Shades of Egoyan's "Ararat" (a more overtly "postmodern" Holocaust story, in which different tribes literally attempt to co-opt the past for themselves). Interestingly, Nathan, a kind of Doppelg&auml;nger of German sadists, is himself a Jewish Nazi, whilst the Nazi officer who forces Sophie to choose between her children is himself given an early speech in which he bemoans having to play God, a weight which he eventually grants Sophie; he allows her to also play executioner. Both Nathan and the Nazi are creatures of the "grey zone", a concept developed by Primo Levi and further elaborated upon by Giorgio Agamben. For both, the grey zone refers to the blurring of boundaries between victims and executioners, and to the murky process of contamination and collaboration by which relationships within the death camps defied any simplistic Manichaean division of good and evil, imposing instead a condition of extreme equivocation (typically in the form of double binds or impossible situations). The zone is a kind of threshold of indistinction, which calls into question the very notion of ethics. Pakula may never go down as a great director, but he was interesting in the way, like Kubrick, he tended to focus on power, conspiracy and power's reliance on double-binds and no win scenarios. Like Warren Beatty in Pakula's "Parallax View", who becomes enshrined in the Law he attempts to remain apart of and/or destroy, Sophie can't help but be complicit. Incidentally, the choice Sophie faces is known as The Double Trolley Problem, a famous thought experiment in cognitive science, neuro-ethics and philosophy. The problem typically involves a subject being given a choice between either allowing 2 trolleys to run over and so kill 2 separate people, or attaching one trolley to another so that only one person dies. The answer to the problem differs depending on whichever branch of philosophy one belongs to. A utilitarian, for example, would typically always save one person. Other schools believe that making the choice is itself an unethical act; had you not intervened, the ethical breech (making the choice to deliberately kill) does not fall on you. When confronted with this problem in surveys, most people instinctively refuse to choose, perceiving "choosing" as being a complicit and "unethical" act. When presented with the choice between photos of loved ones (who will hypothetically die), people overwhelmingly tend to refuse to make the choice as well. According to studies, this is true for over 90 percent of human beings. The less than 10 percent who make utilitarian choices display strong tendencies toward psychopathy, Machiavellianism or tend to view life as being intrinsically meaningless. The film is handsomely shot, but is overly slow and Pakula's use of the Stingo character  a literary device not necessarily needed on film  goes nowhere. The way the film manipulates us into a state of artificial suspense (what is the choice? Who does Sophie choose?) is somewhat tasteless, Pakula's delaying of "the choice" and making it "the final solution" to a mystery echoing the Nazi's manipulating and dismissing of Sophie's humanity. Meryl Streep's acting here is praised, but its overly busy and virtuosic. It's the kind of flashy acting  all surfaces and no depth - that always wins awards; Pakula should have reigned her in. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    History seems to me like a book where every single chapter is written under the traumatic effect of the previous one. To better understand Nazism's rise, one must understand the trauma of the 1918 Armistice on German people BUT to comprehend the French diktat of Versailles in 1919, one must also take into consideration the trauma of the French defeat against the Prussian Army in 1870. Following the same logic, History is the never-ending chronicles of successive traumas turning yesterday's losers into today's winners. But blood sometimes dries quicker than History books' ink, and while we're allowed to judge an event in a more rational and reasonable way, it leads to a very singular paradox: if you deprive your analysis from its emotional substance, you get more objective, rational, yet it can undermine your very comprehension of further events, because men make the events, and most of the times, they're guided by the weight of a traumatic experience -every act of terror takes its roots in another one- but then, if you use emotion, you lose the objectivity, which is the key element in science. To put it in simpler words: one death is a tragedy, one million is statistics, statistics are more relevant to understand the present but only tragedy can help to anticipate the future. A film like "Sophie's Choice" focuses on one tragedy to better highlight the gravity of a much more large-scaled tragic chapter of Human history: the Holocaust and its profound effect on people's minds. The world indeed would never be the same after 1945. But I'm still perplexed about the film. It tells the story of a young woman who survived the atrocities of the Concentration Camps and had to make one of the most horrific choices that was ever allowed to a mother: choosing which of her children would survive. The irony is that she's given this very privilege because she's not Jewish, she's a Catholic and what's more, not a communist, yet she would have to live with a terrible weight in her conscience, something that a Jewish mother wouldn't have to endure because she would be forced to lose her children. Another irony occurs when we discover Sophie's romance with Nathan, an American Jew, we're shocked seeing treated her as a whore for Germans, no matter how sick or demented he was. As I said, it's only through shock that you can comprehend the atrocity of an event. That Nathan carried this pain in his heritage because he was a Jew is one thing but it would be insulting to those who really lived the experience, to distribute the share of guilt and sorrow in the hearts of people who didn't live it, regardless of their ethnic background. So, I'm trying to figure out what the clear purpose of Sophie's story is? I try to imagine what was Alan J. Pakula's thinking when he decided to make the film. He probably thought that it would be great to have a film depicting one of the most horrific and painful dilemmas ever, carried by a marvelous performance from Meryl Streep, who was in her path for cinematic glory. Then, she'd have to tell her story in flashback, because the choice would only work if it came late in a film, to let us sense a trauma hidden inside her heart. But something must provoke the confession; it must be about children, then Stingo, the young idealistic writer, played by Peter MacNicol must ask Sophie for marrying her. Step by step, we get to the necessity of featuring this sort of triangular love between three friends, Nathan, Sophie's lover, Sophie, a Polish Auschwitz survivor with a lovable accent, and the sweet and naive Southern boy who'll naturally fall in love with them, mirroring their very passion for American literature. The promise of the film is carried by three spectacular performances and a sweet and tender score, but I failed to connect the story to the flashbacks and I wonder what the results would have been if the story was simply about Sophie's experience. The movie is guided by Nathan's weird behavior, Sophie's attempts to speak the most correct English, and Stingo's passive observations, the whole thing enrobed by a sort of back-story involving a passion for English and literature. The feelings driven by these parts go from amusing to infuriating, we're touched by Stingo's sweetness, frustrated by Nathan's lunacy and impressed or not by Meryl Streep's remarkable performance. There's a sort of lightness floating in the air that efficiently contrasts with the darkness of the flashback, but when the flashback started, I felt the weakness of the first hour and half that immediately felt like an overlong set-up and made me wonder what was so special to make this film in the American Film Institute's Top 100? One spectacular moment can redeem a whole film  or is it just because it's a Holocaust story  or a coming of age story of a kid who discovered the world's sudden cruelty from Sophie's trauma? Hadn't he heard about writers like Sartre or Camus who expressed their angst toward a world that allowed the Holocaust to happen and accept the idea of a Nuclear bomb wiping out Japanese civilians? To the choice, yes, it remains one of the most heart-breaking moments in cinema's history as I was haunted by the genuinely frightened look of Sophie's daughter and her piercing cries while she was taken in the misty dark under the powerless look of Sophie. Yes, Meryl Streep deserved the Award for that very part. But the rest belonged to another film, and instead of making another 'Holocaust' story, which I'm sure, would have been extraordinary, I trust Pakula's talent for that. He chose the option of a character study but he thinks too much of us on that level, because all the intelligibility of the world can't get over the shock deeply rooted in the experience.

    When Meryl Streep's Sophie slowly discloses her holocaust experience to Peter MacNicol's Stingo I literally felt I was witnessing the entire experience first-hand. Have I had such an experience with any other actor? No, I never have. Part of the credit goes to Alan Pakula for representing the event starkly but a majority of the effort is from Streep who can be termed as the 'best storyteller in the world'. &nbsp;I could sense her caliber in Out of Africa when she importunes the Governor to help the Africans and during the courtroom scene in Kramer vs Kramer, but only in Sophie's Choice could I see no Meryl but a completely different person by the name of Sophie Zawistowska. But that was also the case with Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot, but Meryl, in my opinion, had such a difficult character to portray that to achieve the effect of transporting the audience into Sophie's world without faltering any moment is the pinnacle of the state 'I am' in acting. &nbsp;Some say she her Polish/German/Broken English accent and diction weren't believable enough; my only advice to them is - try perfecting a foreign accent in 3 months yourself. On top of that, Meryl had to transcend Sophie on to the screen, not just with the accents, but with gestures, movements&nbsp;and more importantly, feelings. And Sophie has probably the saddest fate a woman could have - she was married to fear, grief and loss, first during Holocaust and then after the event. Throughout her life, she has had to make choices, many against her conscience; not only the choice that gives the film it's name, but also others for example, in spite of loathing her father's ideals, she used her pure blood status to escape more misery. But the ghosts of her past slowly unravel when Stingo, a young simpleton author develops friendship with her and her lover, the volatile Nathan. And Meryl does all this with uttermost sincerity and spontaneity, never faking it even when she could have got away with it because many people fall for pretenses. &nbsp;I'll tell you about a play I had seen yesterday where one of the actors, as the situation was reaching it's climax, began screaming his lines out as if stung on the rear by a bee. &nbsp; The audience, to my dismay, was in raptures, with an old lady besides me commenting "Superb performance" and I was like " O these audiences can be tricked so easily!". So there may be people who find Meryl's performance to be 'dull' at first, and it is because they believe only an external representation of emotions is enough. I request these people to surrender themselves to Sophie, rather than thinking about how she could have cried buckets instead of just one teardrop to show that she was sad. The character is embodied so completely that I may not be able to endure Sophie's misery again. The choice scene, when watched during the film, is a million times more painful than watching the four minute clip separately on YouTube. The most powerful performance I have witnessed by an actor or actress. Kline and MacNicol have a hard time measuring up to her, but in a way, they gave better performance because of the support they got from Streep's performance. Kline is theatrical but his act suits his character well at times. MacNicol doesn't fail but he neither succeeds in fully justifying his difficult character. The supporting cast, mostly consisting of Germans give authentic performances, the best one coming from the little girl playing Sophie's child, the Nazi officer and the German officer's daughter. The background score is haunting and perfectly placed in the scenes. &nbsp;I frankly wanted more much Sophie and could do without that young coarse lady who had a short-lived romance with Stingo. It was an extraordinary experience watching Meryl acting as a medium for Sophie Zawistowska and a harrowing one to see Sophie's misery. My Rating: 9 out of 10

    Sophie's Choice is one of those films I always meant to watch, and finally got the chance. It is best to go into it with as little idea as to what it's about as possible, as it's a slow film with a lot of layers that get peeled off one by one. A young would-be-author from the South moves to Brooklyn and befriends his neighbors, the couple Nathan and Sophie. All three hit it off, but Nathan's bipolar tendencies do puncture their friendship at times. Sophie, however, is a calm soul as kind as she is tortured by her past in Auschwitz. As the author, Stingo, gets to know them better, he is also taken deeper and deeper into Sophie's past, where a hidden pain resides. Sophie's Choice brilliantly captures two polar opposite worlds. The colourful and tranquil Brooklyn is contrasted strikingly by a late 1930s Poland occupied by Nazis, where the colour drains so much out of the film that any further and it would be black-and-white. The present in Brooklyn is a good haven to have and catch our breath between glimpses into Sophie's horrible past. At the end of the day, in spite of the emotionally shattering story, Sophie's Choice is a story about hope and redemption. The performances certainly helped. Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline are both wonderful as polar opposite personalities, united by a common love for literature. But Meryl Streep is utterly mesmerizing as Sophie. It's not for no reason that this was one of those Oscar-nominated performances of hers that gave that extra edge and got her the statue. All of Sophie's mannerisms, her accent, her speaking German and Polish, her searching for words in English to express what she wants to say, her restrained kindness, her pain; none of it overdone. The director even trusted Streep enough to take long shots with her as she gets into deep characterization. This is quite simply one of the finest female performances in cinema. I did fear, throughout the film, what exactly Sophie's choice was, and I was right, for it is a scene that crushes your heart. But the film comes together in the end and ends in an emotionally satisfying way in spite of everything. Steel yourself for an emotional journey and give Sophie's Choice a view, it's a film as uplifting as it is depressing, and unmissable for cinema buffs.

    The only bit of information about her on IMDb reads: "Attended Tulane University" (the field of study is not even hinted at...). Under her Filmography, there is only one title: "Sophie's Choice"... This is all that remains from a very impressive performance of 1982 by a little girl whose name was Jennifer Lawn. Those who first saw the famous "choice" scene toward the end of the film, where the Academy Award winner Meryl Streep was holding terrified little Jennifer in her arms, must have foreseen a bright future for this kid actress who might easily fool the viewers into believing that she was actually living the scene, rather than just acting it! "A future Oscar winner in the arms of a present one", one might have prophesied back in 1982. Unfortunately, this prophecy never came true... If you have seen the movie, you are certainly familiar with this intensely dramatic scene (DON'T watch it if you have NOT seen the film and plan to do so!): costas-music.blogspot.gr/2012/12/sophies-choice-choice-scene.html

    Sophie's Choice is a drama film that tells the story of a Polish immigrant, Sophie, and her tempestuous lover who share a boarding house with a young writer in Brooklyn. The film stars Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Peter MacNicol. Alan J. Pakula directed the movie and wrote the script from a novel by William Styron of the same title. Aspiring southern author Stingo (MacNichol) heads to New York to seek his fortune. Moving into a dingy Brooklyn boarding house, Stingo strikes up a friendship with research chemist Nathan Landau (Kline) and Nathan's girlfriend, Polish refugee Sophie Zawistowska (Streep). There is something unsettling about the relationship; Nathan is subject to violent mood swings, while Sophie seems to be harboring a horrible secret. Stingo soon learns that both Nathan and Sophie are strangers to truth. One evening, Stingo learns from Sophie that she was married but her husband and her father were killed in a German work camp and that she was interned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Nathan is constantly jealous, and when he is in one of his violent mood swings he convinces himself that Sophie is unfaithful to him and abuses and harasses her. There is a flashback showing Nathan rescuing Sophie from near death from anemia shortly after her immigration to the U.S. Sophie eventually reveals that her father was a Nazi sympathizer. Sophie had a lover, J&oacute;zef, who lived with his half-sister, Wanda, a leader in the Resistance. Wanda tried to convince Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but Sophie declined, fearing she might endanger her children. Two weeks later J&oacute;zef was murdered by the Gestapo, and Sophie was arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children. She reveals to him the tragic choice she was forced to make at Auschwitz. Upon arrival, she was forced to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp. To avoid having both children killed, she chose her son, Jan, to be sent to the children's camp, and her daughter, Eva, to be sent to her death in Crematorium Two. The movie is too Hollywood in look and feel, and the flashback and narration are too conventional, and yet the image of the sickly and pale Meryl Streep recollecting her ordeal lingers in memory long after the film is over. Streep is memorable as Sophie which makes her truly deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actress that she won for this movie. Though it's far from a flawless movie, it is a unified and deeply affecting movie due in part due Streep's performance and the story just takes over and happens to you. It's quite an experience.

    I had heard so much good about this movie, that now when I finally came round to see it 30 years after everybody else, I found it a bit of a disappointment. It is not until the last twenty minutes that it gets really interesting. Most of the time it is slow and boring. Also, I cannot really relate to the character of Sophie. Yes, the choice she had to do was terrible. But one has to remember, that WWII was an awful time for everybody. She was not the only one who lost a child, so to speak. But most people got their act together after the war, and went on with life. I know something of this, because of what my parents have told me from the war. My father (who was Swedish) was a young soldier then, and he lay in preparedness at the Norwegian border, in case the Germans would try to invade Sweden. This meant great suffering, as the temperature was sometimes -42 degrees C. Several of his friends lost fingers and toes to the cold, and once my father was near to succumb in a snow-storm when he had gone astray on skis on the snowy mountain. And my mother, who is Finnish, had it even worse. The Finns were at war with the Russians, my grand-father fell in this war, and my grand-mother had to try to support her four children herself. They were actually starving one winter, and they got down in various diseases - my mother for instance had diphtheria, and the Doctor told her afterward that she had been very close to death. No one in my mother's family actually died though, because of my grand-mother's great courage and wisdom. And YES I realize you cannot really compare a concentration camp and a choice like Sophie's with my parents' experiences during the war - but it is still a matter of degrees. And of attitude - and courage. I think what redeems this movie, is Stingo's (the young author) ongoing comments to the events. Because he has such a very beautiful and poetic language, and such a healthy and positive attitude to life "after all", that shines through. He is the opposite of Sophie's and Nathan's decadence, strangeness, unhealthiness, depression and black outlook on life. One can imagine, that he would really go on to become a great writer after the events in the movie..!

    Alan Pakula directs "Sophie's Choice", adapted from a William Styron novel by the same name. Both were released in the wake of the NBC miniseries "Holocaust" (1978), which rekindled mainstream interest in the Final solution. Highly melodramatic, the film's first half revolves around the tribulations of the Polish Catholic Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep), who has left Post-War Europe for life in Brooklyn, New York. Here she lives with the volatile Nathan Landau (Kevin Kline), a Jewish con man who suffers from schizophrenia. Landau is abusive toward Sophie, plays power games with her, and suspects that Sophia may have betrayed Jews or sided with the Nazis in return for her own personal safety. Both Landau and Sophie are enveloped by self hate; Sophie tortures herself because she did indeed have a secret relationship with the Nazis, whilst Landau literally embodies a kind of Jewish survivor's guilt. The tale's title initially seems to refer to a choice Sophie must make in the present, choosing between one of two lovers, Landau or a young writer called Stingo, but is eventually revealed to be a reference to a past choice given to Sophie by a Nazi officer. His ultimatum? Sophie must choose which of her two children will be killed, lest they both are. Sophie's choice  her giving up of her son  is just one psychic scar carried by the woman throughout the film; her father was a eugenicist who advocated the extermination of Jews. Styron's tale is different from most Holocaust narratives. He focuses on Christians and Slavs (the Holocaust was anti-Christian as well as anti-Semitic) and like Lumet's "The Pawnbroker", a Jew is explicitly one of the tale's key bullies. The film and the novel also differ wildly. A large portion of Styron's novel - completely absent in the film - focuses on white-on-black racism, the American South and the slave trade, and subscribed to a view which Holocaust professor Richard Rubenstein says "rejects Christian anti-Semitism as causative" in favour for the belief that "in its essential character Auschwitz was a capitalistic slave society as much as or even more than it was an extermination centre". The novel also continuously jostles Sophie's first person narratives, Stingo's POV and an omniscient narrator. The overall effect is such that the viewpoints of victims and executioners become blurred or fused together. Styron's story is also structured such that multiple narrators find themselves selfishly warring over both Sophie's body and her story, desperate to claim her "victimization" for themselves. Shades of Egoyan's "Ararat" (a more overtly "postmodern" Holocaust story, in which different tribes literally attempt to co-opt the past for themselves). Interestingly, Nathan, a kind of Doppelg&auml;nger of German sadists, is himself a Jewish Nazi, whilst the Nazi officer who forces Sophie to choose between her children is himself given an early speech in which he bemoans having to play God, a weight which he eventually grants Sophie; he allows her to also play executioner. Both Nathan and the Nazi are creatures of the "grey zone", a concept developed by Primo Levi and further elaborated upon by Giorgio Agamben. For both, the grey zone refers to the blurring of boundaries between victims and executioners, and to the murky process of contamination and collaboration by which relationships within the death camps defied any simplistic Manichaean division of good and evil, imposing instead a condition of extreme equivocation (typically in the form of double binds or impossible situations). The zone is a kind of threshold of indistinction, which calls into question the very notion of ethics. Pakula may never go down as a great director, but he was interesting in the way, like Kubrick, he tended to focus on power, conspiracy and power's reliance on double-binds and no win scenarios. Like Warren Beatty in Pakula's "Parallax View", who becomes enshrined in the Law he attempts to remain apart of and/or destroy, Sophie can't help but be complicit. Incidentally, the choice Sophie faces is known as The Double Trolley Problem, a famous thought experiment in cognitive science, neuro-ethics and philosophy. The problem typically involves a subject being given a choice between either allowing 2 trolleys to run over and so kill 2 separate people, or attaching one trolley to another so that only one person dies. The answer to the problem differs depending on whichever branch of philosophy one belongs to. A utilitarian, for example, would typically always save one person. Other schools believe that making the choice is itself an unethical act; had you not intervened, the ethical breech (making the choice to deliberately kill) does not fall on you. When confronted with this problem in surveys, most people instinctively refuse to choose, perceiving "choosing" as being a complicit and "unethical" act. When presented with the choice between photos of loved ones (who will hypothetically die), people overwhelmingly tend to refuse to make the choice as well. According to studies, this is true for over 90 percent of human beings. The less than 10 percent who make utilitarian choices display strong tendencies toward psychopathy, Machiavellianism or tend to view life as being intrinsically meaningless. The film is handsomely shot, but is overly slow and Pakula's use of the Stingo character  a literary device not necessarily needed on film  goes nowhere. The way the film manipulates us into a state of artificial suspense (what is the choice? Who does Sophie choose?) is somewhat tasteless, Pakula's delaying of "the choice" and making it "the final solution" to a mystery echoing the Nazi's manipulating and dismissing of Sophie's humanity. Meryl Streep's acting here is praised, but its overly busy and virtuosic. It's the kind of flashy acting  all surfaces and no depth - that always wins awards; Pakula should have reigned her in. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    I feel like I was sold a bill of goods. The first half of this movie was not what I came to see. And most of the last quarter for that matter. I think the movie would work much better with a basic framework like Saving Private Ryan. Set me up in the present but let the body of the movie deal with the past. That's a much more interesting subject than what they went with. Throw in how quick the titular and pivotal scene is and the movie is simultaneously plodding and rushed. And the jarring back and forth between her second choice of Stingo or Nathan. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I got whiplash in the back and forth. I can see from her background how that might have happened. I have trouble seeing from Stingo's point of view why he'd expect anything different.

    When i watched Sophies choice it was for physcology class, and I was looking at it from a physc point of view. I had no knowledge as to what it was about before i watched it other than that it had to do with a woman who was in a concentration camp. In watching this movie it was very capturing, Sophie just seemed like a typical woman who had a fight with her boyfriend but as it got further in you could see something about her lover was just not right he was very happy one minute the next he was accusing Sophie of having romance with Stingo a young writer who lived a floor below them and became very good friends with Both Nathan Sophies lover and Sophie herself. As Stingo becomes close to Sophie he starts to find out things from her past in the Camps that not even Nathan knows. There is more to it but something u would have to watch.

    History seems to me like a book where every single chapter is written under the traumatic effect of the previous one. To better understand Nazism's rise, one must understand the trauma of the 1918 Armistice on German people BUT to comprehend the French diktat of Versailles in 1919, one must also take into consideration the trauma of the French defeat against the Prussian Army in 1870. Following the same logic, History is the never-ending chronicles of successive traumas turning yesterday's losers into today's winners. But blood sometimes dries quicker than History books' ink, and while we're allowed to judge an event in a more rational and reasonable way, it leads to a very singular paradox: if you deprive your analysis from its emotional substance, you get more objective, rational, yet it can undermine your very comprehension of further events, because men make the events, and most of the times, they're guided by the weight of a traumatic experience -every act of terror takes its roots in another one- but then, if you use emotion, you lose the objectivity, which is the key element in science. To put it in simpler words: one death is a tragedy, one million is statistics, statistics are more relevant to understand the present but only tragedy can help to anticipate the future. A film like "Sophie's Choice" focuses on one tragedy to better highlight the gravity of a much more large-scaled tragic chapter of Human history: the Holocaust and its profound effect on people's minds. The world indeed would never be the same after 1945. But I'm still perplexed about the film. It tells the story of a young woman who survived the atrocities of the Concentration Camps and had to make one of the most horrific choices that was ever allowed to a mother: choosing which of her children would survive. The irony is that she's given this very privilege because she's not Jewish, she's a Catholic and what's more, not a communist, yet she would have to live with a terrible weight in her conscience, something that a Jewish mother wouldn't have to endure because she would be forced to lose her children. Another irony occurs when we discover Sophie's romance with Nathan, an American Jew, we're shocked seeing treated her as a whore for Germans, no matter how sick or demented he was. As I said, it's only through shock that you can comprehend the atrocity of an event. That Nathan carried this pain in his heritage because he was a Jew is one thing but it would be insulting to those who really lived the experience, to distribute the share of guilt and sorrow in the hearts of people who didn't live it, regardless of their ethnic background. So, I'm trying to figure out what the clear purpose of Sophie's story is? I try to imagine what was Alan J. Pakula's thinking when he decided to make the film. He probably thought that it would be great to have a film depicting one of the most horrific and painful dilemmas ever, carried by a marvelous performance from Meryl Streep, who was in her path for cinematic glory. Then, she'd have to tell her story in flashback, because the choice would only work if it came late in a film, to let us sense a trauma hidden inside her heart. But something must provoke the confession; it must be about children, then Stingo, the young idealistic writer, played by Peter MacNicol must ask Sophie for marrying her. Step by step, we get to the necessity of featuring this sort of triangular love between three friends, Nathan, Sophie's lover, Sophie, a Polish Auschwitz survivor with a lovable accent, and the sweet and naive Southern boy who'll naturally fall in love with them, mirroring their very passion for American literature. The promise of the film is carried by three spectacular performances and a sweet and tender score, but I failed to connect the story to the flashbacks and I wonder what the results would have been if the story was simply about Sophie's experience. The movie is guided by Nathan's weird behavior, Sophie's attempts to speak the most correct English, and Stingo's passive observations, the whole thing enrobed by a sort of back-story involving a passion for English and literature. The feelings driven by these parts go from amusing to infuriating, we're touched by Stingo's sweetness, frustrated by Nathan's lunacy and impressed or not by Meryl Streep's remarkable performance. There's a sort of lightness floating in the air that efficiently contrasts with the darkness of the flashback, but when the flashback started, I felt the weakness of the first hour and half that immediately felt like an overlong set-up and made me wonder what was so special to make this film in the American Film Institute's Top 100? One spectacular moment can redeem a whole film  or is it just because it's a Holocaust story  or a coming of age story of a kid who discovered the world's sudden cruelty from Sophie's trauma? Hadn't he heard about writers like Sartre or Camus who expressed their angst toward a world that allowed the Holocaust to happen and accept the idea of a Nuclear bomb wiping out Japanese civilians? To the choice, yes, it remains one of the most heart-breaking moments in cinema's history as I was haunted by the genuinely frightened look of Sophie's daughter and her piercing cries while she was taken in the misty dark under the powerless look of Sophie. Yes, Meryl Streep deserved the Award for that very part. But the rest belonged to another film, and instead of making another 'Holocaust' story, which I'm sure, would have been extraordinary, I trust Pakula's talent for that. He chose the option of a character study but he thinks too much of us on that level, because all the intelligibility of the world can't get over the shock deeply rooted in the experience.

    When Meryl Streep's Sophie slowly discloses her holocaust experience to Peter MacNicol's Stingo I literally felt I was witnessing the entire experience first-hand. Have I had such an experience with any other actor? No, I never have. Part of the credit goes to Alan Pakula for representing the event starkly but a majority of the effort is from Streep who can be termed as the 'best storyteller in the world'. &nbsp;I could sense her caliber in Out of Africa when she importunes the Governor to help the Africans and during the courtroom scene in Kramer vs Kramer, but only in Sophie's Choice could I see no Meryl but a completely different person by the name of Sophie Zawistowska. But that was also the case with Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot, but Meryl, in my opinion, had such a difficult character to portray that to achieve the effect of transporting the audience into Sophie's world without faltering any moment is the pinnacle of the state 'I am' in acting. &nbsp;Some say she her Polish/German/Broken English accent and diction weren't believable enough; my only advice to them is - try perfecting a foreign accent in 3 months yourself. On top of that, Meryl had to transcend Sophie on to the screen, not just with the accents, but with gestures, movements&nbsp;and more importantly, feelings. And Sophie has probably the saddest fate a woman could have - she was married to fear, grief and loss, first during Holocaust and then after the event. Throughout her life, she has had to make choices, many against her conscience; not only the choice that gives the film it's name, but also others for example, in spite of loathing her father's ideals, she used her pure blood status to escape more misery. But the ghosts of her past slowly unravel when Stingo, a young simpleton author develops friendship with her and her lover, the volatile Nathan. And Meryl does all this with uttermost sincerity and spontaneity, never faking it even when she could have got away with it because many people fall for pretenses. &nbsp;I'll tell you about a play I had seen yesterday where one of the actors, as the situation was reaching it's climax, began screaming his lines out as if stung on the rear by a bee. &nbsp; The audience, to my dismay, was in raptures, with an old lady besides me commenting "Superb performance" and I was like " O these audiences can be tricked so easily!". So there may be people who find Meryl's performance to be 'dull' at first, and it is because they believe only an external representation of emotions is enough. I request these people to surrender themselves to Sophie, rather than thinking about how she could have cried buckets instead of just one teardrop to show that she was sad. The character is embodied so completely that I may not be able to endure Sophie's misery again. The choice scene, when watched during the film, is a million times more painful than watching the four minute clip separately on YouTube. The most powerful performance I have witnessed by an actor or actress. Kline and MacNicol have a hard time measuring up to her, but in a way, they gave better performance because of the support they got from Streep's performance. Kline is theatrical but his act suits his character well at times. MacNicol doesn't fail but he neither succeeds in fully justifying his difficult character. The supporting cast, mostly consisting of Germans give authentic performances, the best one coming from the little girl playing Sophie's child, the Nazi officer and the German officer's daughter. The background score is haunting and perfectly placed in the scenes. &nbsp;I frankly wanted more much Sophie and could do without that young coarse lady who had a short-lived romance with Stingo. It was an extraordinary experience watching Meryl acting as a medium for Sophie Zawistowska and a harrowing one to see Sophie's misery. My Rating: 9 out of 10

    Sophie's Choice is one of those films I always meant to watch, and finally got the chance. It is best to go into it with as little idea as to what it's about as possible, as it's a slow film with a lot of layers that get peeled off one by one. A young would-be-author from the South moves to Brooklyn and befriends his neighbors, the couple Nathan and Sophie. All three hit it off, but Nathan's bipolar tendencies do puncture their friendship at times. Sophie, however, is a calm soul as kind as she is tortured by her past in Auschwitz. As the author, Stingo, gets to know them better, he is also taken deeper and deeper into Sophie's past, where a hidden pain resides. Sophie's Choice brilliantly captures two polar opposite worlds. The colourful and tranquil Brooklyn is contrasted strikingly by a late 1930s Poland occupied by Nazis, where the colour drains so much out of the film that any further and it would be black-and-white. The present in Brooklyn is a good haven to have and catch our breath between glimpses into Sophie's horrible past. At the end of the day, in spite of the emotionally shattering story, Sophie's Choice is a story about hope and redemption. The performances certainly helped. Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline are both wonderful as polar opposite personalities, united by a common love for literature. But Meryl Streep is utterly mesmerizing as Sophie. It's not for no reason that this was one of those Oscar-nominated performances of hers that gave that extra edge and got her the statue. All of Sophie's mannerisms, her accent, her speaking German and Polish, her searching for words in English to express what she wants to say, her restrained kindness, her pain; none of it overdone. The director even trusted Streep enough to take long shots with her as she gets into deep characterization. This is quite simply one of the finest female performances in cinema. I did fear, throughout the film, what exactly Sophie's choice was, and I was right, for it is a scene that crushes your heart. But the film comes together in the end and ends in an emotionally satisfying way in spite of everything. Steel yourself for an emotional journey and give Sophie's Choice a view, it's a film as uplifting as it is depressing, and unmissable for cinema buffs.

    the novel. the director. and the cast. result - memorable movie. or, only, a gem. not only for grace of adaptation. or for magnificent performance of Meryl Streep. but for precise form of an universal message. for the memories of viewer. for the shadow of words and gestures. in fact, it is one of films who, after its end, becomes an experience. aesthetic, emotional and , in same time, a map more than a lesson to understand the life as a chain of profound choices, cruel sacrifices. it is difficult to write a good review. because essential is out of words. because images, the small gestures, the art of each actor, the accent of Sophie are details who gives to entire film soul. a fragile soul. must see it ! for be more rich in the exploration of every day nuances.

    The only bit of information about her on IMDb reads: "Attended Tulane University" (the field of study is not even hinted at...). Under her Filmography, there is only one title: "Sophie's Choice"... This is all that remains from a very impressive performance of 1982 by a little girl whose name was Jennifer Lawn. Those who first saw the famous "choice" scene toward the end of the film, where the Academy Award winner Meryl Streep was holding terrified little Jennifer in her arms, must have foreseen a bright future for this kid actress who might easily fool the viewers into believing that she was actually living the scene, rather than just acting it! "A future Oscar winner in the arms of a present one", one might have prophesied back in 1982. Unfortunately, this prophecy never came true... If you have seen the movie, you are certainly familiar with this intensely dramatic scene (DON'T watch it if you have NOT seen the film and plan to do so!): costas-music.blogspot.gr/2012/12/sophies-choice-choice-scene.html

    Sophie's Choice is a drama film that tells the story of a Polish immigrant, Sophie, and her tempestuous lover who share a boarding house with a young writer in Brooklyn. The film stars Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Peter MacNicol. Alan J. Pakula directed the movie and wrote the script from a novel by William Styron of the same title. Aspiring southern author Stingo (MacNichol) heads to New York to seek his fortune. Moving into a dingy Brooklyn boarding house, Stingo strikes up a friendship with research chemist Nathan Landau (Kline) and Nathan's girlfriend, Polish refugee Sophie Zawistowska (Streep). There is something unsettling about the relationship; Nathan is subject to violent mood swings, while Sophie seems to be harboring a horrible secret. Stingo soon learns that both Nathan and Sophie are strangers to truth. One evening, Stingo learns from Sophie that she was married but her husband and her father were killed in a German work camp and that she was interned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Nathan is constantly jealous, and when he is in one of his violent mood swings he convinces himself that Sophie is unfaithful to him and abuses and harasses her. There is a flashback showing Nathan rescuing Sophie from near death from anemia shortly after her immigration to the U.S. Sophie eventually reveals that her father was a Nazi sympathizer. Sophie had a lover, J&oacute;zef, who lived with his half-sister, Wanda, a leader in the Resistance. Wanda tried to convince Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but Sophie declined, fearing she might endanger her children. Two weeks later J&oacute;zef was murdered by the Gestapo, and Sophie was arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children. She reveals to him the tragic choice she was forced to make at Auschwitz. Upon arrival, she was forced to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp. To avoid having both children killed, she chose her son, Jan, to be sent to the children's camp, and her daughter, Eva, to be sent to her death in Crematorium Two. The movie is too Hollywood in look and feel, and the flashback and narration are too conventional, and yet the image of the sickly and pale Meryl Streep recollecting her ordeal lingers in memory long after the film is over. Streep is memorable as Sophie which makes her truly deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actress that she won for this movie. Though it's far from a flawless movie, it is a unified and deeply affecting movie due in part due Streep's performance and the story just takes over and happens to you. It's quite an experience.

    I had heard so much good about this movie, that now when I finally came round to see it 30 years after everybody else, I found it a bit of a disappointment. It is not until the last twenty minutes that it gets really interesting. Most of the time it is slow and boring. Also, I cannot really relate to the character of Sophie. Yes, the choice she had to do was terrible. But one has to remember, that WWII was an awful time for everybody. She was not the only one who lost a child, so to speak. But most people got their act together after the war, and went on with life. I know something of this, because of what my parents have told me from the war. My father (who was Swedish) was a young soldier then, and he lay in preparedness at the Norwegian border, in case the Germans would try to invade Sweden. This meant great suffering, as the temperature was sometimes -42 degrees C. Several of his friends lost fingers and toes to the cold, and once my father was near to succumb in a snow-storm when he had gone astray on skis on the snowy mountain. And my mother, who is Finnish, had it even worse. The Finns were at war with the Russians, my grand-father fell in this war, and my grand-mother had to try to support her four children herself. They were actually starving one winter, and they got down in various diseases - my mother for instance had diphtheria, and the Doctor told her afterward that she had been very close to death. No one in my mother's family actually died though, because of my grand-mother's great courage and wisdom. And YES I realize you cannot really compare a concentration camp and a choice like Sophie's with my parents' experiences during the war - but it is still a matter of degrees. And of attitude - and courage. I think what redeems this movie, is Stingo's (the young author) ongoing comments to the events. Because he has such a very beautiful and poetic language, and such a healthy and positive attitude to life "after all", that shines through. He is the opposite of Sophie's and Nathan's decadence, strangeness, unhealthiness, depression and black outlook on life. One can imagine, that he would really go on to become a great writer after the events in the movie..!

    Alan Pakula directs "Sophie's Choice", adapted from a William Styron novel by the same name. Both were released in the wake of the NBC miniseries "Holocaust" (1978), which rekindled mainstream interest in the Final solution. Highly melodramatic, the film's first half revolves around the tribulations of the Polish Catholic Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep), who has left Post-War Europe for life in Brooklyn, New York. Here she lives with the volatile Nathan Landau (Kevin Kline), a Jewish con man who suffers from schizophrenia. Landau is abusive toward Sophie, plays power games with her, and suspects that Sophia may have betrayed Jews or sided with the Nazis in return for her own personal safety. Both Landau and Sophie are enveloped by self hate; Sophie tortures herself because she did indeed have a secret relationship with the Nazis, whilst Landau literally embodies a kind of Jewish survivor's guilt. The tale's title initially seems to refer to a choice Sophie must make in the present, choosing between one of two lovers, Landau or a young writer called Stingo, but is eventually revealed to be a reference to a past choice given to Sophie by a Nazi officer. His ultimatum? Sophie must choose which of her two children will be killed, lest they both are. Sophie's choice  her giving up of her son  is just one psychic scar carried by the woman throughout the film; her father was a eugenicist who advocated the extermination of Jews. Styron's tale is different from most Holocaust narratives. He focuses on Christians and Slavs (the Holocaust was anti-Christian as well as anti-Semitic) and like Lumet's "The Pawnbroker", a Jew is explicitly one of the tale's key bullies. The film and the novel also differ wildly. A large portion of Styron's novel - completely absent in the film - focuses on white-on-black racism, the American South and the slave trade, and subscribed to a view which Holocaust professor Richard Rubenstein says "rejects Christian anti-Semitism as causative" in favour for the belief that "in its essential character Auschwitz was a capitalistic slave society as much as or even more than it was an extermination centre". The novel also continuously jostles Sophie's first person narratives, Stingo's POV and an omniscient narrator. The overall effect is such that the viewpoints of victims and executioners become blurred or fused together. Styron's story is also structured such that multiple narrators find themselves selfishly warring over both Sophie's body and her story, desperate to claim her "victimization" for themselves. Shades of Egoyan's "Ararat" (a more overtly "postmodern" Holocaust story, in which different tribes literally attempt to co-opt the past for themselves). Interestingly, Nathan, a kind of Doppelg&auml;nger of German sadists, is himself a Jewish Nazi, whilst the Nazi officer who forces Sophie to choose between her children is himself given an early speech in which he bemoans having to play God, a weight which he eventually grants Sophie; he allows her to also play executioner. Both Nathan and the Nazi are creatures of the "grey zone", a concept developed by Primo Levi and further elaborated upon by Giorgio Agamben. For both, the grey zone refers to the blurring of boundaries between victims and executioners, and to the murky process of contamination and collaboration by which relationships within the death camps defied any simplistic Manichaean division of good and evil, imposing instead a condition of extreme equivocation (typically in the form of double binds or impossible situations). The zone is a kind of threshold of indistinction, which calls into question the very notion of ethics. Pakula may never go down as a great director, but he was interesting in the way, like Kubrick, he tended to focus on power, conspiracy and power's reliance on double-binds and no win scenarios. Like Warren Beatty in Pakula's "Parallax View", who becomes enshrined in the Law he attempts to remain apart of and/or destroy, Sophie can't help but be complicit. Incidentally, the choice Sophie faces is known as The Double Trolley Problem, a famous thought experiment in cognitive science, neuro-ethics and philosophy. The problem typically involves a subject being given a choice between either allowing 2 trolleys to run over and so kill 2 separate people, or attaching one trolley to another so that only one person dies. The answer to the problem differs depending on whichever branch of philosophy one belongs to. A utilitarian, for example, would typically always save one person. Other schools believe that making the choice is itself an unethical act; had you not intervened, the ethical breech (making the choice to deliberately kill) does not fall on you. When confronted with this problem in surveys, most people instinctively refuse to choose, perceiving "choosing" as being a complicit and "unethical" act. When presented with the choice between photos of loved ones (who will hypothetically die), people overwhelmingly tend to refuse to make the choice as well. According to studies, this is true for over 90 percent of human beings. The less than 10 percent who make utilitarian choices display strong tendencies toward psychopathy, Machiavellianism or tend to view life as being intrinsically meaningless. The film is handsomely shot, but is overly slow and Pakula's use of the Stingo character  a literary device not necessarily needed on film  goes nowhere. The way the film manipulates us into a state of artificial suspense (what is the choice? Who does Sophie choose?) is somewhat tasteless, Pakula's delaying of "the choice" and making it "the final solution" to a mystery echoing the Nazi's manipulating and dismissing of Sophie's humanity. Meryl Streep's acting here is praised, but its overly busy and virtuosic. It's the kind of flashy acting  all surfaces and no depth - that always wins awards; Pakula should have reigned her in. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    I feel like I was sold a bill of goods. The first half of this movie was not what I came to see. And most of the last quarter for that matter. I think the movie would work much better with a basic framework like Saving Private Ryan. Set me up in the present but let the body of the movie deal with the past. That's a much more interesting subject than what they went with. Throw in how quick the titular and pivotal scene is and the movie is simultaneously plodding and rushed. And the jarring back and forth between her second choice of Stingo or Nathan. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I got whiplash in the back and forth. I can see from her background how that might have happened. I have trouble seeing from Stingo's point of view why he'd expect anything different.

    When i watched Sophies choice it was for physcology class, and I was looking at it from a physc point of view. I had no knowledge as to what it was about before i watched it other than that it had to do with a woman who was in a concentration camp. In watching this movie it was very capturing, Sophie just seemed like a typical woman who had a fight with her boyfriend but as it got further in you could see something about her lover was just not right he was very happy one minute the next he was accusing Sophie of having romance with Stingo a young writer who lived a floor below them and became very good friends with Both Nathan Sophies lover and Sophie herself. As Stingo becomes close to Sophie he starts to find out things from her past in the Camps that not even Nathan knows. There is more to it but something u would have to watch.

    History seems to me like a book where every single chapter is written under the traumatic effect of the previous one. To better understand Nazism's rise, one must understand the trauma of the 1918 Armistice on German people BUT to comprehend the French diktat of Versailles in 1919, one must also take into consideration the trauma of the French defeat against the Prussian Army in 1870. Following the same logic, History is the never-ending chronicles of successive traumas turning yesterday's losers into today's winners. But blood sometimes dries quicker than History books' ink, and while we're allowed to judge an event in a more rational and reasonable way, it leads to a very singular paradox: if you deprive your analysis from its emotional substance, you get more objective, rational, yet it can undermine your very comprehension of further events, because men make the events, and most of the times, they're guided by the weight of a traumatic experience -every act of terror takes its roots in another one- but then, if you use emotion, you lose the objectivity, which is the key element in science. To put it in simpler words: one death is a tragedy, one million is statistics, statistics are more relevant to understand the present but only tragedy can help to anticipate the future. A film like "Sophie's Choice" focuses on one tragedy to better highlight the gravity of a much more large-scaled tragic chapter of Human history: the Holocaust and its profound effect on people's minds. The world indeed would never be the same after 1945. But I'm still perplexed about the film. It tells the story of a young woman who survived the atrocities of the Concentration Camps and had to make one of the most horrific choices that was ever allowed to a mother: choosing which of her children would survive. The irony is that she's given this very privilege because she's not Jewish, she's a Catholic and what's more, not a communist, yet she would have to live with a terrible weight in her conscience, something that a Jewish mother wouldn't have to endure because she would be forced to lose her children. Another irony occurs when we discover Sophie's romance with Nathan, an American Jew, we're shocked seeing treated her as a whore for Germans, no matter how sick or demented he was. As I said, it's only through shock that you can comprehend the atrocity of an event. That Nathan carried this pain in his heritage because he was a Jew is one thing but it would be insulting to those who really lived the experience, to distribute the share of guilt and sorrow in the hearts of people who didn't live it, regardless of their ethnic background. So, I'm trying to figure out what the clear purpose of Sophie's story is? I try to imagine what was Alan J. Pakula's thinking when he decided to make the film. He probably thought that it would be great to have a film depicting one of the most horrific and painful dilemmas ever, carried by a marvelous performance from Meryl Streep, who was in her path for cinematic glory. Then, she'd have to tell her story in flashback, because the choice would only work if it came late in a film, to let us sense a trauma hidden inside her heart. But something must provoke the confession; it must be about children, then Stingo, the young idealistic writer, played by Peter MacNicol must ask Sophie for marrying her. Step by step, we get to the necessity of featuring this sort of triangular love between three friends, Nathan, Sophie's lover, Sophie, a Polish Auschwitz survivor with a lovable accent, and the sweet and naive Southern boy who'll naturally fall in love with them, mirroring their very passion for American literature. The promise of the film is carried by three spectacular performances and a sweet and tender score, but I failed to connect the story to the flashbacks and I wonder what the results would have been if the story was simply about Sophie's experience. The movie is guided by Nathan's weird behavior, Sophie's attempts to speak the most correct English, and Stingo's passive observations, the whole thing enrobed by a sort of back-story involving a passion for English and literature. The feelings driven by these parts go from amusing to infuriating, we're touched by Stingo's sweetness, frustrated by Nathan's lunacy and impressed or not by Meryl Streep's remarkable performance. There's a sort of lightness floating in the air that efficiently contrasts with the darkness of the flashback, but when the flashback started, I felt the weakness of the first hour and half that immediately felt like an overlong set-up and made me wonder what was so special to make this film in the American Film Institute's Top 100? One spectacular moment can redeem a whole film  or is it just because it's a Holocaust story  or a coming of age story of a kid who discovered the world's sudden cruelty from Sophie's trauma? Hadn't he heard about writers like Sartre or Camus who expressed their angst toward a world that allowed the Holocaust to happen and accept the idea of a Nuclear bomb wiping out Japanese civilians? To the choice, yes, it remains one of the most heart-breaking moments in cinema's history as I was haunted by the genuinely frightened look of Sophie's daughter and her piercing cries while she was taken in the misty dark under the powerless look of Sophie. Yes, Meryl Streep deserved the Award for that very part. But the rest belonged to another film, and instead of making another 'Holocaust' story, which I'm sure, would have been extraordinary, I trust Pakula's talent for that. He chose the option of a character study but he thinks too much of us on that level, because all the intelligibility of the world can't get over the shock deeply rooted in the experience.

    When Meryl Streep's Sophie slowly discloses her holocaust experience to Peter MacNicol's Stingo I literally felt I was witnessing the entire experience first-hand. Have I had such an experience with any other actor? No, I never have. Part of the credit goes to Alan Pakula for representing the event starkly but a majority of the effort is from Streep who can be termed as the 'best storyteller in the world'. &nbsp;I could sense her caliber in Out of Africa when she importunes the Governor to help the Africans and during the courtroom scene in Kramer vs Kramer, but only in Sophie's Choice could I see no Meryl but a completely different person by the name of Sophie Zawistowska. But that was also the case with Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot, but Meryl, in my opinion, had such a difficult character to portray that to achieve the effect of transporting the audience into Sophie's world without faltering any moment is the pinnacle of the state 'I am' in acting. &nbsp;Some say she her Polish/German/Broken English accent and diction weren't believable enough; my only advice to them is - try perfecting a foreign accent in 3 months yourself. On top of that, Meryl had to transcend Sophie on to the screen, not just with the accents, but with gestures, movements&nbsp;and more importantly, feelings. And Sophie has probably the saddest fate a woman could have - she was married to fear, grief and loss, first during Holocaust and then after the event. Throughout her life, she has had to make choices, many against her conscience; not only the choice that gives the film it's name, but also others for example, in spite of loathing her father's ideals, she used her pure blood status to escape more misery. But the ghosts of her past slowly unravel when Stingo, a young simpleton author develops friendship with her and her lover, the volatile Nathan. And Meryl does all this with uttermost sincerity and spontaneity, never faking it even when she could have got away with it because many people fall for pretenses. &nbsp;I'll tell you about a play I had seen yesterday where one of the actors, as the situation was reaching it's climax, began screaming his lines out as if stung on the rear by a bee. &nbsp; The audience, to my dismay, was in raptures, with an old lady besides me commenting "Superb performance" and I was like " O these audiences can be tricked so easily!". So there may be people who find Meryl's performance to be 'dull' at first, and it is because they believe only an external representation of emotions is enough. I request these people to surrender themselves to Sophie, rather than thinking about how she could have cried buckets instead of just one teardrop to show that she was sad. The character is embodied so completely that I may not be able to endure Sophie's misery again. The choice scene, when watched during the film, is a million times more painful than watching the four minute clip separately on YouTube. The most powerful performance I have witnessed by an actor or actress. Kline and MacNicol have a hard time measuring up to her, but in a way, they gave better performance because of the support they got from Streep's performance. Kline is theatrical but his act suits his character well at times. MacNicol doesn't fail but he neither succeeds in fully justifying his difficult character. The supporting cast, mostly consisting of Germans give authentic performances, the best one coming from the little girl playing Sophie's child, the Nazi officer and the German officer's daughter. The background score is haunting and perfectly placed in the scenes. &nbsp;I frankly wanted more much Sophie and could do without that young coarse lady who had a short-lived romance with Stingo. It was an extraordinary experience watching Meryl acting as a medium for Sophie Zawistowska and a harrowing one to see Sophie's misery. My Rating: 9 out of 10

    Sophie's Choice is one of those films I always meant to watch, and finally got the chance. It is best to go into it with as little idea as to what it's about as possible, as it's a slow film with a lot of layers that get peeled off one by one. A young would-be-author from the South moves to Brooklyn and befriends his neighbors, the couple Nathan and Sophie. All three hit it off, but Nathan's bipolar tendencies do puncture their friendship at times. Sophie, however, is a calm soul as kind as she is tortured by her past in Auschwitz. As the author, Stingo, gets to know them better, he is also taken deeper and deeper into Sophie's past, where a hidden pain resides. Sophie's Choice brilliantly captures two polar opposite worlds. The colourful and tranquil Brooklyn is contrasted strikingly by a late 1930s Poland occupied by Nazis, where the colour drains so much out of the film that any further and it would be black-and-white. The present in Brooklyn is a good haven to have and catch our breath between glimpses into Sophie's horrible past. At the end of the day, in spite of the emotionally shattering story, Sophie's Choice is a story about hope and redemption. The performances certainly helped. Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline are both wonderful as polar opposite personalities, united by a common love for literature. But Meryl Streep is utterly mesmerizing as Sophie. It's not for no reason that this was one of those Oscar-nominated performances of hers that gave that extra edge and got her the statue. All of Sophie's mannerisms, her accent, her speaking German and Polish, her searching for words in English to express what she wants to say, her restrained kindness, her pain; none of it overdone. The director even trusted Streep enough to take long shots with her as she gets into deep characterization. This is quite simply one of the finest female performances in cinema. I did fear, throughout the film, what exactly Sophie's choice was, and I was right, for it is a scene that crushes your heart. But the film comes together in the end and ends in an emotionally satisfying way in spite of everything. Steel yourself for an emotional journey and give Sophie's Choice a view, it's a film as uplifting as it is depressing, and unmissable for cinema buffs.

    the novel. the director. and the cast. result - memorable movie. or, only, a gem. not only for grace of adaptation. or for magnificent performance of Meryl Streep. but for precise form of an universal message. for the memories of viewer. for the shadow of words and gestures. in fact, it is one of films who, after its end, becomes an experience. aesthetic, emotional and , in same time, a map more than a lesson to understand the life as a chain of profound choices, cruel sacrifices. it is difficult to write a good review. because essential is out of words. because images, the small gestures, the art of each actor, the accent of Sophie are details who gives to entire film soul. a fragile soul. must see it ! for be more rich in the exploration of every day nuances.

    The only bit of information about her on IMDb reads: "Attended Tulane University" (the field of study is not even hinted at...). Under her Filmography, there is only one title: "Sophie's Choice"... This is all that remains from a very impressive performance of 1982 by a little girl whose name was Jennifer Lawn. Those who first saw the famous "choice" scene toward the end of the film, where the Academy Award winner Meryl Streep was holding terrified little Jennifer in her arms, must have foreseen a bright future for this kid actress who might easily fool the viewers into believing that she was actually living the scene, rather than just acting it! "A future Oscar winner in the arms of a present one", one might have prophesied back in 1982. Unfortunately, this prophecy never came true... If you have seen the movie, you are certainly familiar with this intensely dramatic scene (DON'T watch it if you have NOT seen the film and plan to do so!): costas-music.blogspot.gr/2012/12/sophies-choice-choice-scene.html

    Sophie's Choice is a drama film that tells the story of a Polish immigrant, Sophie, and her tempestuous lover who share a boarding house with a young writer in Brooklyn. The film stars Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Peter MacNicol. Alan J. Pakula directed the movie and wrote the script from a novel by William Styron of the same title. Aspiring southern author Stingo (MacNichol) heads to New York to seek his fortune. Moving into a dingy Brooklyn boarding house, Stingo strikes up a friendship with research chemist Nathan Landau (Kline) and Nathan's girlfriend, Polish refugee Sophie Zawistowska (Streep). There is something unsettling about the relationship; Nathan is subject to violent mood swings, while Sophie seems to be harboring a horrible secret. Stingo soon learns that both Nathan and Sophie are strangers to truth. One evening, Stingo learns from Sophie that she was married but her husband and her father were killed in a German work camp and that she was interned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Nathan is constantly jealous, and when he is in one of his violent mood swings he convinces himself that Sophie is unfaithful to him and abuses and harasses her. There is a flashback showing Nathan rescuing Sophie from near death from anemia shortly after her immigration to the U.S. Sophie eventually reveals that her father was a Nazi sympathizer. Sophie had a lover, J&oacute;zef, who lived with his half-sister, Wanda, a leader in the Resistance. Wanda tried to convince Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but Sophie declined, fearing she might endanger her children. Two weeks later J&oacute;zef was murdered by the Gestapo, and Sophie was arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children. She reveals to him the tragic choice she was forced to make at Auschwitz. Upon arrival, she was forced to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp. To avoid having both children killed, she chose her son, Jan, to be sent to the children's camp, and her daughter, Eva, to be sent to her death in Crematorium Two. The movie is too Hollywood in look and feel, and the flashback and narration are too conventional, and yet the image of the sickly and pale Meryl Streep recollecting her ordeal lingers in memory long after the film is over. Streep is memorable as Sophie which makes her truly deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actress that she won for this movie. Though it's far from a flawless movie, it is a unified and deeply affecting movie due in part due Streep's performance and the story just takes over and happens to you. It's quite an experience.

    I had heard so much good about this movie, that now when I finally came round to see it 30 years after everybody else, I found it a bit of a disappointment. It is not until the last twenty minutes that it gets really interesting. Most of the time it is slow and boring. Also, I cannot really relate to the character of Sophie. Yes, the choice she had to do was terrible. But one has to remember, that WWII was an awful time for everybody. She was not the only one who lost a child, so to speak. But most people got their act together after the war, and went on with life. I know something of this, because of what my parents have told me from the war. My father (who was Swedish) was a young soldier then, and he lay in preparedness at the Norwegian border, in case the Germans would try to invade Sweden. This meant great suffering, as the temperature was sometimes -42 degrees C. Several of his friends lost fingers and toes to the cold, and once my father was near to succumb in a snow-storm when he had gone astray on skis on the snowy mountain. And my mother, who is Finnish, had it even worse. The Finns were at war with the Russians, my grand-father fell in this war, and my grand-mother had to try to support her four children herself. They were actually starving one winter, and they got down in various diseases - my mother for instance had diphtheria, and the Doctor told her afterward that she had been very close to death. No one in my mother's family actually died though, because of my grand-mother's great courage and wisdom. And YES I realize you cannot really compare a concentration camp and a choice like Sophie's with my parents' experiences during the war - but it is still a matter of degrees. And of attitude - and courage. I think what redeems this movie, is Stingo's (the young author) ongoing comments to the events. Because he has such a very beautiful and poetic language, and such a healthy and positive attitude to life "after all", that shines through. He is the opposite of Sophie's and Nathan's decadence, strangeness, unhealthiness, depression and black outlook on life. One can imagine, that he would really go on to become a great writer after the events in the movie..!

    Alan Pakula directs "Sophie's Choice", adapted from a William Styron novel by the same name. Both were released in the wake of the NBC miniseries "Holocaust" (1978), which rekindled mainstream interest in the Final solution. Highly melodramatic, the film's first half revolves around the tribulations of the Polish Catholic Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep), who has left Post-War Europe for life in Brooklyn, New York. Here she lives with the volatile Nathan Landau (Kevin Kline), a Jewish con man who suffers from schizophrenia. Landau is abusive toward Sophie, plays power games with her, and suspects that Sophia may have betrayed Jews or sided with the Nazis in return for her own personal safety. Both Landau and Sophie are enveloped by self hate; Sophie tortures herself because she did indeed have a secret relationship with the Nazis, whilst Landau literally embodies a kind of Jewish survivor's guilt. The tale's title initially seems to refer to a choice Sophie must make in the present, choosing between one of two lovers, Landau or a young writer called Stingo, but is eventually revealed to be a reference to a past choice given to Sophie by a Nazi officer. His ultimatum? Sophie must choose which of her two children will be killed, lest they both are. Sophie's choice  her giving up of her son  is just one psychic scar carried by the woman throughout the film; her father was a eugenicist who advocated the extermination of Jews. Styron's tale is different from most Holocaust narratives. He focuses on Christians and Slavs (the Holocaust was anti-Christian as well as anti-Semitic) and like Lumet's "The Pawnbroker", a Jew is explicitly one of the tale's key bullies. The film and the novel also differ wildly. A large portion of Styron's novel - completely absent in the film - focuses on white-on-black racism, the American South and the slave trade, and subscribed to a view which Holocaust professor Richard Rubenstein says "rejects Christian anti-Semitism as causative" in favour for the belief that "in its essential character Auschwitz was a capitalistic slave society as much as or even more than it was an extermination centre". The novel also continuously jostles Sophie's first person narratives, Stingo's POV and an omniscient narrator. The overall effect is such that the viewpoints of victims and executioners become blurred or fused together. Styron's story is also structured such that multiple narrators find themselves selfishly warring over both Sophie's body and her story, desperate to claim her "victimization" for themselves. Shades of Egoyan's "Ararat" (a more overtly "postmodern" Holocaust story, in which different tribes literally attempt to co-opt the past for themselves). Interestingly, Nathan, a kind of Doppelg&auml;nger of German sadists, is himself a Jewish Nazi, whilst the Nazi officer who forces Sophie to choose between her children is himself given an early speech in which he bemoans having to play God, a weight which he eventually grants Sophie; he allows her to also play executioner. Both Nathan and the Nazi are creatures of the "grey zone", a concept developed by Primo Levi and further elaborated upon by Giorgio Agamben. For both, the grey zone refers to the blurring of boundaries between victims and executioners, and to the murky process of contamination and collaboration by which relationships within the death camps defied any simplistic Manichaean division of good and evil, imposing instead a condition of extreme equivocation (typically in the form of double binds or impossible situations). The zone is a kind of threshold of indistinction, which calls into question the very notion of ethics. Pakula may never go down as a great director, but he was interesting in the way, like Kubrick, he tended to focus on power, conspiracy and power's reliance on double-binds and no win scenarios. Like Warren Beatty in Pakula's "Parallax View", who becomes enshrined in the Law he attempts to remain apart of and/or destroy, Sophie can't help but be complicit. Incidentally, the choice Sophie faces is known as The Double Trolley Problem, a famous thought experiment in cognitive science, neuro-ethics and philosophy. The problem typically involves a subject being given a choice between either allowing 2 trolleys to run over and so kill 2 separate people, or attaching one trolley to another so that only one person dies. The answer to the problem differs depending on whichever branch of philosophy one belongs to. A utilitarian, for example, would typically always save one person. Other schools believe that making the choice is itself an unethical act; had you not intervened, the ethical breech (making the choice to deliberately kill) does not fall on you. When confronted with this problem in surveys, most people instinctively refuse to choose, perceiving "choosing" as being a complicit and "unethical" act. When presented with the choice between photos of loved ones (who will hypothetically die), people overwhelmingly tend to refuse to make the choice as well. According to studies, this is true for over 90 percent of human beings. The less than 10 percent who make utilitarian choices display strong tendencies toward psychopathy, Machiavellianism or tend to view life as being intrinsically meaningless. The film is handsomely shot, but is overly slow and Pakula's use of the Stingo character  a literary device not necessarily needed on film  goes nowhere. The way the film manipulates us into a state of artificial suspense (what is the choice? Who does Sophie choose?) is somewhat tasteless, Pakula's delaying of "the choice" and making it "the final solution" to a mystery echoing the Nazi's manipulating and dismissing of Sophie's humanity. Meryl Streep's acting here is praised, but its overly busy and virtuosic. It's the kind of flashy acting  all surfaces and no depth - that always wins awards; Pakula should have reigned her in. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    I feel like I was sold a bill of goods. The first half of this movie was not what I came to see. And most of the last quarter for that matter. I think the movie would work much better with a basic framework like Saving Private Ryan. Set me up in the present but let the body of the movie deal with the past. That's a much more interesting subject than what they went with. Throw in how quick the titular and pivotal scene is and the movie is simultaneously plodding and rushed. And the jarring back and forth between her second choice of Stingo or Nathan. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I got whiplash in the back and forth. I can see from her background how that might have happened. I have trouble seeing from Stingo's point of view why he'd expect anything different.

    When i watched Sophies choice it was for physcology class, and I was looking at it from a physc point of view. I had no knowledge as to what it was about before i watched it other than that it had to do with a woman who was in a concentration camp. In watching this movie it was very capturing, Sophie just seemed like a typical woman who had a fight with her boyfriend but as it got further in you could see something about her lover was just not right he was very happy one minute the next he was accusing Sophie of having romance with Stingo a young writer who lived a floor below them and became very good friends with Both Nathan Sophies lover and Sophie herself. As Stingo becomes close to Sophie he starts to find out things from her past in the Camps that not even Nathan knows. There is more to it but something u would have to watch.

    History seems to me like a book where every single chapter is written under the traumatic effect of the previous one. To better understand Nazism's rise, one must understand the trauma of the 1918 Armistice on German people BUT to comprehend the French diktat of Versailles in 1919, one must also take into consideration the trauma of the French defeat against the Prussian Army in 1870. Following the same logic, History is the never-ending chronicles of successive traumas turning yesterday's losers into today's winners. But blood sometimes dries quicker than History books' ink, and while we're allowed to judge an event in a more rational and reasonable way, it leads to a very singular paradox: if you deprive your analysis from its emotional substance, you get more objective, rational, yet it can undermine your very comprehension of further events, because men make the events, and most of the times, they're guided by the weight of a traumatic experience -every act of terror takes its roots in another one- but then, if you use emotion, you lose the objectivity, which is the key element in science. To put it in simpler words: one death is a tragedy, one million is statistics, statistics are more relevant to understand the present but only tragedy can help to anticipate the future. A film like "Sophie's Choice" focuses on one tragedy to better highlight the gravity of a much more large-scaled tragic chapter of Human history: the Holocaust and its profound effect on people's minds. The world indeed would never be the same after 1945. But I'm still perplexed about the film. It tells the story of a young woman who survived the atrocities of the Concentration Camps and had to make one of the most horrific choices that was ever allowed to a mother: choosing which of her children would survive. The irony is that she's given this very privilege because she's not Jewish, she's a Catholic and what's more, not a communist, yet she would have to live with a terrible weight in her conscience, something that a Jewish mother wouldn't have to endure because she would be forced to lose her children. Another irony occurs when we discover Sophie's romance with Nathan, an American Jew, we're shocked seeing treated her as a whore for Germans, no matter how sick or demented he was. As I said, it's only through shock that you can comprehend the atrocity of an event. That Nathan carried this pain in his heritage because he was a Jew is one thing but it would be insulting to those who really lived the experience, to distribute the share of guilt and sorrow in the hearts of people who didn't live it, regardless of their ethnic background. So, I'm trying to figure out what the clear purpose of Sophie's story is? I try to imagine what was Alan J. Pakula's thinking when he decided to make the film. He probably thought that it would be great to have a film depicting one of the most horrific and painful dilemmas ever, carried by a marvelous performance from Meryl Streep, who was in her path for cinematic glory. Then, she'd have to tell her story in flashback, because the choice would only work if it came late in a film, to let us sense a trauma hidden inside her heart. But something must provoke the confession; it must be about children, then Stingo, the young idealistic writer, played by Peter MacNicol must ask Sophie for marrying her. Step by step, we get to the necessity of featuring this sort of triangular love between three friends, Nathan, Sophie's lover, Sophie, a Polish Auschwitz survivor with a lovable accent, and the sweet and naive Southern boy who'll naturally fall in love with them, mirroring their very passion for American literature. The promise of the film is carried by three spectacular performances and a sweet and tender score, but I failed to connect the story to the flashbacks and I wonder what the results would have been if the story was simply about Sophie's experience. The movie is guided by Nathan's weird behavior, Sophie's attempts to speak the most correct English, and Stingo's passive observations, the whole thing enrobed by a sort of back-story involving a passion for English and literature. The feelings driven by these parts go from amusing to infuriating, we're touched by Stingo's sweetness, frustrated by Nathan's lunacy and impressed or not by Meryl Streep's remarkable performance. There's a sort of lightness floating in the air that efficiently contrasts with the darkness of the flashback, but when the flashback started, I felt the weakness of the first hour and half that immediately felt like an overlong set-up and made me wonder what was so special to make this film in the American Film Institute's Top 100? One spectacular moment can redeem a whole film  or is it just because it's a Holocaust story  or a coming of age story of a kid who discovered the world's sudden cruelty from Sophie's trauma? Hadn't he heard about writers like Sartre or Camus who expressed their angst toward a world that allowed the Holocaust to happen and accept the idea of a Nuclear bomb wiping out Japanese civilians? To the choice, yes, it remains one of the most heart-breaking moments in cinema's history as I was haunted by the genuinely frightened look of Sophie's daughter and her piercing cries while she was taken in the misty dark under the powerless look of Sophie. Yes, Meryl Streep deserved the Award for that very part. But the rest belonged to another film, and instead of making another 'Holocaust' story, which I'm sure, would have been extraordinary, I trust Pakula's talent for that. He chose the option of a character study but he thinks too much of us on that level, because all the intelligibility of the world can't get over the shock deeply rooted in the experience.

    When Meryl Streep's Sophie slowly discloses her holocaust experience to Peter MacNicol's Stingo I literally felt I was witnessing the entire experience first-hand. Have I had such an experience with any other actor? No, I never have. Part of the credit goes to Alan Pakula for representing the event starkly but a majority of the effort is from Streep who can be termed as the 'best storyteller in the world'. &nbsp;I could sense her caliber in Out of Africa when she importunes the Governor to help the Africans and during the courtroom scene in Kramer vs Kramer, but only in Sophie's Choice could I see no Meryl but a completely different person by the name of Sophie Zawistowska. But that was also the case with Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot, but Meryl, in my opinion, had such a difficult character to portray that to achieve the effect of transporting the audience into Sophie's world without faltering any moment is the pinnacle of the state 'I am' in acting. &nbsp;Some say she her Polish/German/Broken English accent and diction weren't believable enough; my only advice to them is - try perfecting a foreign accent in 3 months yourself. On top of that, Meryl had to transcend Sophie on to the screen, not just with the accents, but with gestures, movements&nbsp;and more importantly, feelings. And Sophie has probably the saddest fate a woman could have - she was married to fear, grief and loss, first during Holocaust and then after the event. Throughout her life, she has had to make choices, many against her conscience; not only the choice that gives the film it's name, but also others for example, in spite of loathing her father's ideals, she used her pure blood status to escape more misery. But the ghosts of her past slowly unravel when Stingo, a young simpleton author develops friendship with her and her lover, the volatile Nathan. And Meryl does all this with uttermost sincerity and spontaneity, never faking it even when she could have got away with it because many people fall for pretenses. &nbsp;I'll tell you about a play I had seen yesterday where one of the actors, as the situation was reaching it's climax, began screaming his lines out as if stung on the rear by a bee. &nbsp; The audience, to my dismay, was in raptures, with an old lady besides me commenting "Superb performance" and I was like " O these audiences can be tricked so easily!". So there may be people who find Meryl's performance to be 'dull' at first, and it is because they believe only an external representation of emotions is enough. I request these people to surrender themselves to Sophie, rather than thinking about how she could have cried buckets instead of just one teardrop to show that she was sad. The character is embodied so completely that I may not be able to endure Sophie's misery again. The choice scene, when watched during the film, is a million times more painful than watching the four minute clip separately on YouTube. The most powerful performance I have witnessed by an actor or actress. Kline and MacNicol have a hard time measuring up to her, but in a way, they gave better performance because of the support they got from Streep's performance. Kline is theatrical but his act suits his character well at times. MacNicol doesn't fail but he neither succeeds in fully justifying his difficult character. The supporting cast, mostly consisting of Germans give authentic performances, the best one coming from the little girl playing Sophie's child, the Nazi officer and the German officer's daughter. The background score is haunting and perfectly placed in the scenes. &nbsp;I frankly wanted more much Sophie and could do without that young coarse lady who had a short-lived romance with Stingo. It was an extraordinary experience watching Meryl acting as a medium for Sophie Zawistowska and a harrowing one to see Sophie's misery. My Rating: 9 out of 10

    Sophie's Choice is one of those films I always meant to watch, and finally got the chance. It is best to go into it with as little idea as to what it's about as possible, as it's a slow film with a lot of layers that get peeled off one by one. A young would-be-author from the South moves to Brooklyn and befriends his neighbors, the couple Nathan and Sophie. All three hit it off, but Nathan's bipolar tendencies do puncture their friendship at times. Sophie, however, is a calm soul as kind as she is tortured by her past in Auschwitz. As the author, Stingo, gets to know them better, he is also taken deeper and deeper into Sophie's past, where a hidden pain resides. Sophie's Choice brilliantly captures two polar opposite worlds. The colourful and tranquil Brooklyn is contrasted strikingly by a late 1930s Poland occupied by Nazis, where the colour drains so much out of the film that any further and it would be black-and-white. The present in Brooklyn is a good haven to have and catch our breath between glimpses into Sophie's horrible past. At the end of the day, in spite of the emotionally shattering story, Sophie's Choice is a story about hope and redemption. The performances certainly helped. Peter MacNicol and Kevin Kline are both wonderful as polar opposite personalities, united by a common love for literature. But Meryl Streep is utterly mesmerizing as Sophie. It's not for no reason that this was one of those Oscar-nominated performances of hers that gave that extra edge and got her the statue. All of Sophie's mannerisms, her accent, her speaking German and Polish, her searching for words in English to express what she wants to say, her restrained kindness, her pain; none of it overdone. The director even trusted Streep enough to take long shots with her as she gets into deep characterization. This is quite simply one of the finest female performances in cinema. I did fear, throughout the film, what exactly Sophie's choice was, and I was right, for it is a scene that crushes your heart. But the film comes together in the end and ends in an emotionally satisfying way in spite of everything. Steel yourself for an emotional journey and give Sophie's Choice a view, it's a film as uplifting as it is depressing, and unmissable for cinema buffs.

    The only bit of information about her on IMDb reads: "Attended Tulane University" (the field of study is not even hinted at...). Under her Filmography, there is only one title: "Sophie's Choice"... This is all that remains from a very impressive performance of 1982 by a little girl whose name was Jennifer Lawn. Those who first saw the famous "choice" scene toward the end of the film, where the Academy Award winner Meryl Streep was holding terrified little Jennifer in her arms, must have foreseen a bright future for this kid actress who might easily fool the viewers into believing that she was actually living the scene, rather than just acting it! "A future Oscar winner in the arms of a present one", one might have prophesied back in 1982. Unfortunately, this prophecy never came true... If you have seen the movie, you are certainly familiar with this intensely dramatic scene (DON'T watch it if you have NOT seen the film and plan to do so!): costas-music.blogspot.gr/2012/12/sophies-choice-choice-scene.html

    Sophie's Choice is a drama film that tells the story of a Polish immigrant, Sophie, and her tempestuous lover who share a boarding house with a young writer in Brooklyn. The film stars Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, and Peter MacNicol. Alan J. Pakula directed the movie and wrote the script from a novel by William Styron of the same title. Aspiring southern author Stingo (MacNichol) heads to New York to seek his fortune. Moving into a dingy Brooklyn boarding house, Stingo strikes up a friendship with research chemist Nathan Landau (Kline) and Nathan's girlfriend, Polish refugee Sophie Zawistowska (Streep). There is something unsettling about the relationship; Nathan is subject to violent mood swings, while Sophie seems to be harboring a horrible secret. Stingo soon learns that both Nathan and Sophie are strangers to truth. One evening, Stingo learns from Sophie that she was married but her husband and her father were killed in a German work camp and that she was interned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Nathan is constantly jealous, and when he is in one of his violent mood swings he convinces himself that Sophie is unfaithful to him and abuses and harasses her. There is a flashback showing Nathan rescuing Sophie from near death from anemia shortly after her immigration to the U.S. Sophie eventually reveals that her father was a Nazi sympathizer. Sophie had a lover, J&oacute;zef, who lived with his half-sister, Wanda, a leader in the Resistance. Wanda tried to convince Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but Sophie declined, fearing she might endanger her children. Two weeks later J&oacute;zef was murdered by the Gestapo, and Sophie was arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children. She reveals to him the tragic choice she was forced to make at Auschwitz. Upon arrival, she was forced to choose which one of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp. To avoid having both children killed, she chose her son, Jan, to be sent to the children's camp, and her daughter, Eva, to be sent to her death in Crematorium Two. The movie is too Hollywood in look and feel, and the flashback and narration are too conventional, and yet the image of the sickly and pale Meryl Streep recollecting her ordeal lingers in memory long after the film is over. Streep is memorable as Sophie which makes her truly deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actress that she won for this movie. Though it's far from a flawless movie, it is a unified and deeply affecting movie due in part due Streep's performance and the story just takes over and happens to you. It's quite an experience.

    I had heard so much good about this movie, that now when I finally came round to see it 30 years after everybody else, I found it a bit of a disappointment. It is not until the last twenty minutes that it gets really interesting. Most of the time it is slow and boring. Also, I cannot really relate to the character of Sophie. Yes, the choice she had to do was terrible. But one has to remember, that WWII was an awful time for everybody. She was not the only one who lost a child, so to speak. But most people got their act together after the war, and went on with life. I know something of this, because of what my parents have told me from the war. My father (who was Swedish) was a young soldier then, and he lay in preparedness at the Norwegian border, in case the Germans would try to invade Sweden. This meant great suffering, as the temperature was sometimes -42 degrees C. Several of his friends lost fingers and toes to the cold, and once my father was near to succumb in a snow-storm when he had gone astray on skis on the snowy mountain. And my mother, who is Finnish, had it even worse. The Finns were at war with the Russians, my grand-father fell in this war, and my grand-mother had to try to support her four children herself. They were actually starving one winter, and they got down in various diseases - my mother for instance had diphtheria, and the Doctor told her afterward that she had been very close to death. No one in my mother's family actually died though, because of my grand-mother's great courage and wisdom. And YES I realize you cannot really compare a concentration camp and a choice like Sophie's with my parents' experiences during the war - but it is still a matter of degrees. And of attitude - and courage. I think what redeems this movie, is Stingo's (the young author) ongoing comments to the events. Because he has such a very beautiful and poetic language, and such a healthy and positive attitude to life "after all", that shines through. He is the opposite of Sophie's and Nathan's decadence, strangeness, unhealthiness, depression and black outlook on life. One can imagine, that he would really go on to become a great writer after the events in the movie..!

    Alan Pakula directs "Sophie's Choice", adapted from a William Styron novel by the same name. Both were released in the wake of the NBC miniseries "Holocaust" (1978), which rekindled mainstream interest in the Final solution. Highly melodramatic, the film's first half revolves around the tribulations of the Polish Catholic Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep), who has left Post-War Europe for life in Brooklyn, New York. Here she lives with the volatile Nathan Landau (Kevin Kline), a Jewish con man who suffers from schizophrenia. Landau is abusive toward Sophie, plays power games with her, and suspects that Sophia may have betrayed Jews or sided with the Nazis in return for her own personal safety. Both Landau and Sophie are enveloped by self hate; Sophie tortures herself because she did indeed have a secret relationship with the Nazis, whilst Landau literally embodies a kind of Jewish survivor's guilt. The tale's title initially seems to refer to a choice Sophie must make in the present, choosing between one of two lovers, Landau or a young writer called Stingo, but is eventually revealed to be a reference to a past choice given to Sophie by a Nazi officer. His ultimatum? Sophie must choose which of her two children will be killed, lest they both are. Sophie's choice  her giving up of her son  is just one psychic scar carried by the woman throughout the film; her father was a eugenicist who advocated the extermination of Jews. Styron's tale is different from most Holocaust narratives. He focuses on Christians and Slavs (the Holocaust was anti-Christian as well as anti-Semitic) and like Lumet's "The Pawnbroker", a Jew is explicitly one of the tale's key bullies. The film and the novel also differ wildly. A large portion of Styron's novel - completely absent in the film - focuses on white-on-black racism, the American South and the slave trade, and subscribed to a view which Holocaust professor Richard Rubenstein says "rejects Christian anti-Semitism as causative" in favour for the belief that "in its essential character Auschwitz was a capitalistic slave society as much as or even more than it was an extermination centre". The novel also continuously jostles Sophie's first person narratives, Stingo's POV and an omniscient narrator. The overall effect is such that the viewpoints of victims and executioners become blurred or fused together. Styron's story is also structured such that multiple narrators find themselves selfishly warring over both Sophie's body and her story, desperate to claim her "victimization" for themselves. Shades of Egoyan's "Ararat" (a more overtly "postmodern" Holocaust story, in which different tribes literally attempt to co-opt the past for themselves). Interestingly, Nathan, a kind of Doppelg&auml;nger of German sadists, is himself a Jewish Nazi, whilst the Nazi officer who forces Sophie to choose between her children is himself given an early speech in which he bemoans having to play God, a weight which he eventually grants Sophie; he allows her to also play executioner. Both Nathan and the Nazi are creatures of the "grey zone", a concept developed by Primo Levi and further elaborated upon by Giorgio Agamben. For both, the grey zone refers to the blurring of boundaries between victims and executioners, and to the murky process of contamination and collaboration by which relationships within the death camps defied any simplistic Manichaean division of good and evil, imposing instead a condition of extreme equivocation (typically in the form of double binds or impossible situations). The zone is a kind of threshold of indistinction, which calls into question the very notion of ethics. Pakula may never go down as a great director, but he was interesting in the way, like Kubrick, he tended to focus on power, conspiracy and power's reliance on double-binds and no win scenarios. Like Warren Beatty in Pakula's "Parallax View", who becomes enshrined in the Law he attempts to remain apart of and/or destroy, Sophie can't help but be complicit. Incidentally, the choice Sophie faces is known as The Double Trolley Problem, a famous thought experiment in cognitive science, neuro-ethics and philosophy. The problem typically involves a subject being given a choice between either allowing 2 trolleys to run over and so kill 2 separate people, or attaching one trolley to another so that only one person dies. The answer to the problem differs depending on whichever branch of philosophy one belongs to. A utilitarian, for example, would typically always save one person. Other schools believe that making the choice is itself an unethical act; had you not intervened, the ethical breech (making the choice to deliberately kill) does not fall on you. When confronted with this problem in surveys, most people instinctively refuse to choose, perceiving "choosing" as being a complicit and "unethical" act. When presented with the choice between photos of loved ones (who will hypothetically die), people overwhelmingly tend to refuse to make the choice as well. According to studies, this is true for over 90 percent of human beings. The less than 10 percent who make utilitarian choices display strong tendencies toward psychopathy, Machiavellianism or tend to view life as being intrinsically meaningless. The film is handsomely shot, but is overly slow and Pakula's use of the Stingo character  a literary device not necessarily needed on film  goes nowhere. The way the film manipulates us into a state of artificial suspense (what is the choice? Who does Sophie choose?) is somewhat tasteless, Pakula's delaying of "the choice" and making it "the final solution" to a mystery echoing the Nazi's manipulating and dismissing of Sophie's humanity. Meryl Streep's acting here is praised, but its overly busy and virtuosic. It's the kind of flashy acting  all surfaces and no depth - that always wins awards; Pakula should have reigned her in. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    I feel like I was sold a bill of goods. The first half of this movie was not what I came to see. And most of the last quarter for that matter. I think the movie would work much better with a basic framework like Saving Private Ryan. Set me up in the present but let the body of the movie deal with the past. That's a much more interesting subject than what they went with. Throw in how quick the titular and pivotal scene is and the movie is simultaneously plodding and rushed. And the jarring back and forth between her second choice of Stingo or Nathan. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I got whiplash in the back and forth. I can see from her background how that might have happened. I have trouble seeing from Stingo's point of view why he'd expect anything different.

    When i watched Sophies choice it was for physcology class, and I was looking at it from a physc point of view. I had no knowledge as to what it was about before i watched it other than that it had to do with a woman who was in a concentration camp. In watching this movie it was very capturing, Sophie just seemed like a typical woman who had a fight with her boyfriend but as it got further in you could see something about her lover was just not right he was very happy one minute the next he was accusing Sophie of having romance with Stingo a young writer who lived a floor below them and became very good friends with Both Nathan Sophies lover and Sophie herself. As Stingo becomes close to Sophie he starts to find out things from her past in the Camps that not even Nathan knows. There is more to it but something u would have to watch.

    History seems to me like a book where every single chapter is written under the traumatic effect of the previous one. To better understand Nazism's rise, one must understand the trauma of the 1918 Armistice on German people BUT to comprehend the French diktat of Versailles in 1919, one must also take into consideration the trauma of the French defeat against the Prussian Army in 1870. Following the same logic, History is the never-ending chronicles of successive traumas turning yesterday's losers into today's winners. But blood sometimes dries quicker than History books' ink, and while we're allowed to judge an event in a more rational and reasonable way, it leads to a very singular paradox: if you deprive your analysis from its emotional substance, you get more objective, rational, yet it can undermine your very comprehension of further events, because men make the events, and most of the times, they're guided by the weight of a traumatic experience -every act of terror takes its roots in another one- but then, if you use emotion, you lose the objectivity, which is the key element in science. To put it in simpler words: one death is a tragedy, one million is statistics, statistics are more relevant to understand the present but only tragedy can help to anticipate the future. A film like "Sophie's Choice" focuses on one tragedy to better highlight the gravity of a much more large-scaled tragic chapter of Human history: the Holocaust and its profound effect on people's minds. The world indeed would never be the same after 1945. But I'm still perplexed about the film. It tells the story of a young woman who survived the atrocities of the Concentration Camps and had to make one of the most horrific choices that was ever allowed to a mother: choosing which of her children would survive. The irony is that she's given this very privilege because she's not Jewish, she's a Catholic and what's more, not a communist, yet she would have to live with a terrible weight in her conscience, something that a Jewish mother wouldn't have to endure because she would be forced to lose her children. Another irony occurs when we discover Sophie's romance with Nathan, an American Jew, we're shocked seeing treated her as a whore for Germans, no matter how sick or demented he was. As I said, it's only through shock that you can comprehend the atrocity of an event. That Nathan carried this pain in his heritage because he was a Jew is one thing but it would be insulting to those who really lived the experience, to distribute the share of guilt and sorrow in the hearts of people who didn't live it, regardless of their ethnic background. So, I'm trying to figure out what the clear purpose of Sophie's story is? I try to imagine what was Alan J. Pakula's thinking when he decided to make the film. He probably thought that it would be great to have a film depicting one of the most horrific and painful dilemmas ever, carried by a marvelous performance from Meryl Streep, who was in her path for cinematic glory. Then, she'd have to tell her story in flashback, because the choice would only work if it came late in a film, to let us sense a trauma hidden inside her heart. But something must provoke the confession; it must be about children, then Stingo, the young idealistic writer, played by Peter MacNicol must ask Sophie for marrying her. Step by step, we get to the necessity of featuring this sort of triangular love between three friends, Nathan, Sophie's lover, Sophie, a Polish Auschwitz survivor with a lovable accent, and the sweet and naive Southern boy who'll naturally fall in love with them, mirroring their very passion for American literature. The promise of the film is carried by three spectacular performances and a sweet and tender score, but I failed to connect the story to the flashbacks and I wonder what the results would have been if the story was simply about Sophie's experience. The movie is guided by Nathan's weird behavior, Sophie's attempts to speak the most correct English, and Stingo's passive observations, the whole thing enrobed by a sort of back-story involving a passion for English and literature. The feelings driven by these parts go from amusing to infuriating, we're touched by Stingo's sweetness, frustrated by Nathan's lunacy and impressed or not by Meryl Streep's remarkable performance. There's a sort of lightness floating in the air that efficiently contrasts with the darkness of the flashback, but when the flashback started, I felt the weakness of the first hour and half that immediately felt like an overlong set-up and made me wonder what was so special to make this film in the American Film Institute's Top 100? One spectacular moment can redeem a whole film  or is it just because it's a Holocaust story  or a coming of age story of a kid who discovered the world's sudden cruelty from Sophie's trauma? Hadn't he heard about writers like Sartre or Camus who expressed their angst toward a world that allowed the Holocaust to happen and accept the idea of a Nuclear bomb wiping out Japanese civilians? To the choice, yes, it remains one of the most heart-breaking moments in cinema's history as I was haunted by the genuinely frightened look of Sophie's daughter and her piercing cries while she was taken in the misty dark under the powerless look of Sophie. Yes, Meryl Streep deserved the Award for that very part. But the rest belonged to another film, and instead of making another 'Holocaust' story, which I'm sure, would have been extraordinary, I trust Pakula's talent for that. He chose the option of a character study but he thinks too much of us on that level, because all the intelligibility of the world can't get over the shock deeply rooted in the experience.

    When Meryl Streep's Sophie slowly discloses her holocaust experience to Peter MacNicol's Stingo I literally felt I was witnessing the entire experience first-hand. Have I had such an experience with any other actor? No, I never have. Part of the credit goes to Alan Pakula for representing the event starkly but a majority of the effort is from Streep who can be termed as the 'best storyteller in the world'. &nbsp;I could sense her caliber in Out of Africa when she importunes the Governor to help the Africans and during the courtroom scene in Kramer vs Kramer, but only in Sophie's Choice could I see no Meryl but a completely different person by the name of Sophie Zawistowska. But that was also the case with Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot, but Meryl, in my opinion, had such a difficult character to portray that to achieve the effect of transporting the audience into Sophie's world without faltering any moment is the pinnacle of the state 'I am' in acting. &nbsp;Some say she her Polish/German/Broken English accent and diction weren't believable enough; my only advice to them is - try perfecting a foreign accent in 3 months yourself. On top of that, Meryl had to transcend Sophie on to the screen, not just with the accents, but with gestures, movements&nbsp;and more importantly, feelings. And Sophie has probably the saddest fate a woman could have - she was married to fear, grief and loss, first during Holocaust and then after the event. Throughout her life, she has had to make choices, many against her conscience; not only the choice that gives the film it's name, but also others for example, in spite of loathing her father's ideals, she used her pure blood status to escape more misery. But the ghosts of her past slowly unravel when Stingo, a young simpleton author develops friendship with her and her lover, the volatile Nathan. And Meryl does all this with uttermost sincerity and spontaneity, never faking it even when she could have got away with it because many people fall for pretenses. &nbsp;I'll tell you about a play I had seen yesterday where one of the actors, as the situation was reaching it's climax, began screaming his lines out as if stung on the rear by a bee. &nbsp; The audience, to my dismay, was in raptures, with an old lady besides me commenting "Superb performance" and I was like " O these audiences can be tricked so easily!". So there may be people who find Meryl's performance to be 'dull' at first, and it is because they believe only an external representation of emotions is enough. I request these people to surrender themselves to Sophie, rather than thinking about how she could have cried buckets instead of just one teardrop to show that she was sad. The character is embodied so completely that I may not be able to endure Sophie's misery again. The choice scene, when watched during the film, is a million times more painful than watching the four minute clip separately on YouTube. The most powerful performance I have witnessed by an actor or actress. Kline and MacNicol have a hard time measuring up to her, but in a way, they gave better performance because of the support they got from Streep's performance. Kline is theatrical but his act suits his character well at times. MacNicol doesn't fail but he neither succeeds in fully justifying his difficult character. The supporting cast, mostly consisting of Germans give authentic performances, the best one coming from the little girl playing Sophie's child, the Nazi officer and the German officer's daughter. The background score is haunting and perfectly placed in the scenes. &nbsp;I frankly wanted more much Sophie and could do without that young coarse lady who had a short-lived romance with Stingo. It was an extraordinary experience watching Meryl acting as a medium for Sophie Zawistowska and a harrowing one to see Sophie's misery. My Rating: 9 out of 10
