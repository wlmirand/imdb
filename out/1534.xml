 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Twin Town opens with wide sweeping shots of seaside Swansea; to be the place of action for the next one and a half hours. The serene setting with miles upon miles of old semi-detached housing is suddenly cleaved apart by two young lads tearing through the neighbourhood in a two tone BMW 525. Julian and Jeremy are in deep trouble. Their dysfunctional family scrapes together a living from their dole money and odd-jobs offered to their father. The boys have long since turned to drug abuse and car theft leading a happy-go-lucky life in downtown no-hoper city. In due course the plot thickens as the boys are out for revenge against wealthy club owner Bryn who is not particularly helpful in providing compensation when their father is hit by an accident when working on his premises. The boys are fairly imaginative when it comes to planning their strike, culminating in scenes which all dog-haters and karaoke loathers will love.

    This is one of my favourite all time films, it is funny, irreverent, unexpected, gritty, real in a surreal way and very very funny. Maybe not everyone got it.. maybe not everyone has been to Wales.. but it captures it so accurately, in a comic book yet real way. It is full of tender moments as well as being brutal and immoral. So many jokes, so many visual gags, and so many really warm and well imagined characters. It is two fingers up to Hollywood, to formulaic movies.. it is in a whole new genre of it own. From the very first scene to its finale it is rich in entertainment, shock, surprise, humour and emotion. This is such a good film... I love it!

    I recall this being referred to as the Welsh attempt at 'Trainspotting' when it first came out; presumably because it came out soon after, took place in a Celtic country and featured drugs... this is an unfair comparison as they are very different films. Set in Swansea it follows two pairs of men; the Lewis Brothers, a couple of layabout car thieves with a taste for class B drugs; and Terry and Greyo, a couple of bent coppers getting involved in the cocaine trade with local Nouveau riche business man Bryn Cartwright. After the Lewis boys hit Terry's car he is determined to get his revenge. The boys meanwhile have got it in for Bryn after he refuses to pay any compensation when their father is hurt on one of his business sites. They start off their cycle of revenge by urinating on Bryn's daughter as she sings at the local karaoke night... things quickly escalate to killing pets and ultimately the boys' parents and sister are killed when Terry is trying to set fire to their dog... from then on things get darker as the boys set about getting their revenge and Terry tries to find somebody else to blame. As stated before this is not 'Trainspotting' so if you expect something like that you will be disappointed, it is however very funny for the most part although you are likely to suffer mood whiplash half way through when people start dying. Real life brothers Llyr and Rhys Ifans do well as the Lewis brothers, bringing a real sense of anarchy to the roles, Dougray Scott is the other most notable actor; bringing a sense of menace to the part of Terry while still being funny. While it is for the most part fairly funny there are few genuinely likable characters; even the ones we are meant to like are criminals! If you are easily offended this probably isn't the film for you but if you aren't put off by a lot of swearing and some fairly offensive behaviour you should have a good laugh.

    Twin Town follows the Lewis brothers also known as the the twins (Jeremy and Julian) played by Rhys Ifans and Llyr Ifans- also brothers in real life although only the former has gone on to forge a successful career in the movies (Notting Hill, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, The Amazing Spider-Man [2012]). Put simply they are delinquent layabouts who are renowned locally for their compulsion to steal cars, get into mischief and take as many tokes as they can from all manner of homemade bongs- utilising everything from shower heads to golf clubs. They live on a caravan site overshadowed by the Swansea industrial works with their parents, sister and dog Cantona (named so after a Welsh football player). The plot revolves around a series of confrontations that start as frivolous but soon escalate to serious between the twins and the local big crook as the twins feel their father, Fatty, has been wronged. Throw in bent copper Terry with delusions of grandeur played well by Dougray Scott, a karaoke king, some cocaine and a poodle and you've got yourselves the making of an intriguing movie. The movie unsurprisingly is riddled with Welsh references that some people may be unfamiliar with and understanding the lingo might take a couple of minutes if you have never heard a Welshman before but hang in there as your patience will be rewarded. What I particularly like about this movie is that its rough around the edges and very realistic as you can imagine these types of people existing in the real world. It's also well known for containing its high usage of the word f'k summed up brilliantly with the first line of the movie- "F'ing dead, f'ing dead as f'k". It is to Twin Town what alcohol is to Withnail And I. As you can therefore imagine the script is not elegant and may not be to everyone's liking but there is some good dialogue thrown in to get you laughing and the development of the plot is well thought out occasionally throwing you in the wrong direction and leading to a well concluded climax. Twin Town is a unique dark comedy that's passed too many people by and this needs to be rectified as it's a very good movie that has just the right amount of comedy, violence and in the Lewis brothers a couple of cracking, if not slightly disturbing, characters that you end up getting behind and really connecting with.

    Quite simply, this is the funniest and most quoted movie we've ever seen, and remains an absolute must see. "Cup of tea boys..." While on the first run through, it might seem like a swear-fest, this is a movie which deserves to be watched time and time again. For one reason or another , Twin Town avoided mainstream success, and yet at the same time developed a cult following, which, to this day remains underground. Understandably, this would have never been a film to make big box office bucks, but I assume that was never the intention. Written as sharply as todays modern sit-coms, and far sharper than most recent films, it remains understated and extremely dark at times, while still managing to make you laugh out loud repeatably and rewind to watch again. The last few scenes, a testament to the confidence of the writers, are some of the best. My only hope is that we get to see more of the not-so-famous actors that appear throughout, those that play Greyo, Adie and Dai etc, because without their contribution, the movie wouldn't have been so complete. Keith Allen should be placed high upon a pedestal, and pestered continually until he agrees to write again, be it Welsh or not. "You reckon this boat'll get us to Morocco...".

    Whereas the two cities in the Central Lowlands of Scotland had Trainspotting, then Wales's second city of Swansea had Twin Town. Despite looking quite promising with the locals, this film in fact fails to achieve all expectations of Trainspotting and reviews were patchy that in some cases, the local cinema goers around area where it was filmed claim it wasn't good mainly because it contained too much bad language. I was expecting them to be wrong at first but then I admit that they were right. If Trainspotting has considerable use of strong language with a cert 18, then Twin Town is in fact far more excessive in swearing and in one occasion the language is sometimes poorly overused together with a rather poor plot and therefore making it a bit of a dud film. Much of the younger local viewers love Twin Town and pompously claim it to be a classic and as it is known that in the 1990s, any particular area where the film was made had a high rate of car crime.

    Just wanted to say to the guy who thought this film had a bad ending, you clearly don't understand the essence of escalation. "Revenge is a dish best served cold" you will note is the opening lines of the Kill Bill Series, not a black comedy granted but a similar themed film. The whole point of revenge is to go one better than what was done to you, when someone blows up your entire family, albeit unintentionally then what better way to dish out the moment when said opponent in the battle of revenge meets his maker, than by carrying out your dead fathers wish. In my mind this is the ultimate black comedy, a biased decision I'm sure growing up on the welsh border and getting an extra tickle from the welsh eccentricities, but from a writing point of view, perfectly executed!

    Some like to call Twin Town the "Welsh Trainspotting". I would disagree - while it has some similarities such as prolific drug use and a bleak portrayal of a city in the United Kingdom (in this case Swansea, with bits of Port Talbot), the two films are quite different. Twin Town takes place in 90s Swansea, where brothers Julian (Llyr Ifans) and Jeremy Lewis (Rhys Ifans) live a carefree existence smoking weed and driving stolen cars at high speed through the residential areas of Swansea. Their father, Fatty (Huw Ceredig) does work for local businessman and small-time gangster Bryn Cartwright (William Thomas), and falls from a ladder and breaks his leg while working on a roof. Bryn refuses to give the family compensation for Fatty's injury, and the brothers take revenge by urinating on his daughter, Bonny (Jenny Evans) during a singing competition at the local (sadly, now-defunct) nightclub, Barons. This starts off an escalating feud which involves the decapitation of a poodle, and the surprisingly massive explosion of a caravan, culminating in some rather brutal justice inflicted on Bryn and his partner in crime, corrupt cop Terry Walsh (Dougray Scott). I'm not going to go and spoil the entire thing, but what I will say is that things take a rather dark turn, with Julian and Jeremy showing a rather unexpected creative mind for murder, especially given that they appear to be just permanently wasted. As a Swansea resident, I have to say that while the drug use in the film is exaggerated, it does capture the seedier side of Swansea quite well. The scenes of Swansea's nightlife are perhaps too accurate (anyone who has been to Wind Street at its worst will know what I mean), and the accent and rather, erm, colourful way that the characters speak is spot on. It also, however, captures some of the more beautiful aspects of the city, namely its heart (although the Lewis family are dysfunctional, they have a very warm family dynamic), and also the beautiful scenery in the area (visible in the panoramic shots of the city), and I think that any Welshman couldn't watch the funeral scene at the end as the choir sings "Myfanwy" without wiping away a tear. I saw that the film got quite a few bad reviews on the net (and indeed on here). I think possibly some might not get the accents, or indeed the feel of the film - ultimately, to really enjoy the film, you have to have lived in Swansea to get the most out of it, as if you have, a particular location or character will tie in with certain memories you have of the place, whereas otherwise, it might not. It's most definitely worth checking out, and add another star if you're from Swansea!

    During my tenure as chief projectionist of the Commodore Cinema, Aberystwyth, the only film to have received a standing ovation on more than one night for a week's screening. It's a university town so we have a good mix of local punters, students and holiday people. I rest my case. The nineties was, on the whole, a good decade for cinema I think. All we seem to have had since then is a load of cgi filled soulless film equivalent of a fast food outlet (Hancock?). Maybe it's just me getting older. I checked out the "hated it" rating for Twin Town tonight, and was pleasantly surprised to see only two negative reviews receiving two stars or less. Bloody hell. Some bugger's just nicked my car..............

    The film has everything you'd want it to have. Especially if you're British. Probably more of a bloke's film, but still fun for everyone. The story is brilliant, and so accurately welsh. Every minor detail adds to the whole experience. The film progresses like a serious drama and seems to come out with brilliant comedy without even trying. As well as the actual storyline being funny, little quirks about each character and even the attention to welsh detail makes you laugh. Not only is it well written, it's also beautifully filmed, and makes great use of the camera. The film encompasses a huge range of interesting shots. Enhancing the film further was it's great choice of cast. All the characters were perfectly conveyed, and film avoided any bad performances. The music is also something to listen out for, as it stands out as a good piece of work on it's own. I highly recommend Twin Town (especially if you're British), as it's an exciting film experience with a great story, interesting shots, decent actors, and appropriate use of excessive swearing and violence.

    I didn't know where this film was going until I saw the Godfather-esquire poodle's head scene! Then, I knew this was going to be good! The director had a flawless visual sense and the dialogue was equally good- maybe because it was so hard for a Yank to understand. That idiot's attempt to kill the dog by setting it's house on fire, but not before putting on the dead dog's collar because it was classy and "Italian" had me LMHO. The combination of hundreds of old guys singing that nostalgic song by the sea and the "burial by sea" scene was one of the weirdest, funniest things I've ever seen in my life!!! The tacky Petulia Clark songs were perfect, also.

    The film has everything you'd want it to have. Especially if you're British. Probably more of a bloke's film, but still fun for everyone. The story is brilliant, and so accurately welsh. Every minor detail adds to the whole experience. The film progresses like a serious drama and seems to come out with brilliant comedy without even trying. As well as the actual storyline being funny, little quirks about each character and even the attention to welsh detail makes you laugh. Not only is it well written, it's also beautifully filmed, and makes great use of the camera. The film encompasses a huge range of interesting shots. Enhancing the film further was it's great choice of cast. All the characters were perfectly conveyed, and film avoided any bad performances. The music is also something to listen out for, as it stands out as a good piece of work on it's own. I highly recommend Twin Town (especially if you're British), as it's an exciting film experience with a great story, interesting shots, decent actors, and appropriate use of excessive swearing and violence.

    I didn't know where this film was going until I saw the Godfather-esquire poodle's head scene! Then, I knew this was going to be good! The director had a flawless visual sense and the dialogue was equally good- maybe because it was so hard for a Yank to understand. That idiot's attempt to kill the dog by setting it's house on fire, but not before putting on the dead dog's collar because it was classy and "Italian" had me LMHO. The combination of hundreds of old guys singing that nostalgic song by the sea and the "burial by sea" scene was one of the weirdest, funniest things I've ever seen in my life!!! The tacky Petulia Clark songs were perfect, also.

    This is one of my favourite all time films, it is funny, irreverent, unexpected, gritty, real in a surreal way and very very funny. Maybe not everyone got it.. maybe not everyone has been to Wales.. but it captures it so accurately, in a comic book yet real way. It is full of tender moments as well as being brutal and immoral. So many jokes, so many visual gags, and so many really warm and well imagined characters. It is two fingers up to Hollywood, to formulaic movies.. it is in a whole new genre of it own. From the very first scene to its finale it is rich in entertainment, shock, surprise, humour and emotion. This is such a good film... I love it!

    I recall this being referred to as the Welsh attempt at 'Trainspotting' when it first came out; presumably because it came out soon after, took place in a Celtic country and featured drugs... this is an unfair comparison as they are very different films. Set in Swansea it follows two pairs of men; the Lewis Brothers, a couple of layabout car thieves with a taste for class B drugs; and Terry and Greyo, a couple of bent coppers getting involved in the cocaine trade with local Nouveau riche business man Bryn Cartwright. After the Lewis boys hit Terry's car he is determined to get his revenge. The boys meanwhile have got it in for Bryn after he refuses to pay any compensation when their father is hurt on one of his business sites. They start off their cycle of revenge by urinating on Bryn's daughter as she sings at the local karaoke night... things quickly escalate to killing pets and ultimately the boys' parents and sister are killed when Terry is trying to set fire to their dog... from then on things get darker as the boys set about getting their revenge and Terry tries to find somebody else to blame. As stated before this is not 'Trainspotting' so if you expect something like that you will be disappointed, it is however very funny for the most part although you are likely to suffer mood whiplash half way through when people start dying. Real life brothers Llyr and Rhys Ifans do well as the Lewis brothers, bringing a real sense of anarchy to the roles, Dougray Scott is the other most notable actor; bringing a sense of menace to the part of Terry while still being funny. While it is for the most part fairly funny there are few genuinely likable characters; even the ones we are meant to like are criminals! If you are easily offended this probably isn't the film for you but if you aren't put off by a lot of swearing and some fairly offensive behaviour you should have a good laugh.

    Twin Town follows the Lewis brothers also known as the the twins (Jeremy and Julian) played by Rhys Ifans and Llyr Ifans- also brothers in real life although only the former has gone on to forge a successful career in the movies (Notting Hill, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, The Amazing Spider-Man [2012]). Put simply they are delinquent layabouts who are renowned locally for their compulsion to steal cars, get into mischief and take as many tokes as they can from all manner of homemade bongs- utilising everything from shower heads to golf clubs. They live on a caravan site overshadowed by the Swansea industrial works with their parents, sister and dog Cantona (named so after a Welsh football player). The plot revolves around a series of confrontations that start as frivolous but soon escalate to serious between the twins and the local big crook as the twins feel their father, Fatty, has been wronged. Throw in bent copper Terry with delusions of grandeur played well by Dougray Scott, a karaoke king, some cocaine and a poodle and you've got yourselves the making of an intriguing movie. The movie unsurprisingly is riddled with Welsh references that some people may be unfamiliar with and understanding the lingo might take a couple of minutes if you have never heard a Welshman before but hang in there as your patience will be rewarded. What I particularly like about this movie is that its rough around the edges and very realistic as you can imagine these types of people existing in the real world. It's also well known for containing its high usage of the word f'k summed up brilliantly with the first line of the movie- "F'ing dead, f'ing dead as f'k". It is to Twin Town what alcohol is to Withnail And I. As you can therefore imagine the script is not elegant and may not be to everyone's liking but there is some good dialogue thrown in to get you laughing and the development of the plot is well thought out occasionally throwing you in the wrong direction and leading to a well concluded climax. Twin Town is a unique dark comedy that's passed too many people by and this needs to be rectified as it's a very good movie that has just the right amount of comedy, violence and in the Lewis brothers a couple of cracking, if not slightly disturbing, characters that you end up getting behind and really connecting with.

    Quite simply, this is the funniest and most quoted movie we've ever seen, and remains an absolute must see. "Cup of tea boys..." While on the first run through, it might seem like a swear-fest, this is a movie which deserves to be watched time and time again. For one reason or another , Twin Town avoided mainstream success, and yet at the same time developed a cult following, which, to this day remains underground. Understandably, this would have never been a film to make big box office bucks, but I assume that was never the intention. Written as sharply as todays modern sit-coms, and far sharper than most recent films, it remains understated and extremely dark at times, while still managing to make you laugh out loud repeatably and rewind to watch again. The last few scenes, a testament to the confidence of the writers, are some of the best. My only hope is that we get to see more of the not-so-famous actors that appear throughout, those that play Greyo, Adie and Dai etc, because without their contribution, the movie wouldn't have been so complete. Keith Allen should be placed high upon a pedestal, and pestered continually until he agrees to write again, be it Welsh or not. "You reckon this boat'll get us to Morocco...".

    Whereas the two cities in the Central Lowlands of Scotland had Trainspotting, then Wales's second city of Swansea had Twin Town. Despite looking quite promising with the locals, this film in fact fails to achieve all expectations of Trainspotting and reviews were patchy that in some cases, the local cinema goers around area where it was filmed claim it wasn't good mainly because it contained too much bad language. I was expecting them to be wrong at first but then I admit that they were right. If Trainspotting has considerable use of strong language with a cert 18, then Twin Town is in fact far more excessive in swearing and in one occasion the language is sometimes poorly overused together with a rather poor plot and therefore making it a bit of a dud film. Much of the younger local viewers love Twin Town and pompously claim it to be a classic and as it is known that in the 1990s, any particular area where the film was made had a high rate of car crime.

    Just wanted to say to the guy who thought this film had a bad ending, you clearly don't understand the essence of escalation. "Revenge is a dish best served cold" you will note is the opening lines of the Kill Bill Series, not a black comedy granted but a similar themed film. The whole point of revenge is to go one better than what was done to you, when someone blows up your entire family, albeit unintentionally then what better way to dish out the moment when said opponent in the battle of revenge meets his maker, than by carrying out your dead fathers wish. In my mind this is the ultimate black comedy, a biased decision I'm sure growing up on the welsh border and getting an extra tickle from the welsh eccentricities, but from a writing point of view, perfectly executed!

    Some like to call Twin Town the "Welsh Trainspotting". I would disagree - while it has some similarities such as prolific drug use and a bleak portrayal of a city in the United Kingdom (in this case Swansea, with bits of Port Talbot), the two films are quite different. Twin Town takes place in 90s Swansea, where brothers Julian (Llyr Ifans) and Jeremy Lewis (Rhys Ifans) live a carefree existence smoking weed and driving stolen cars at high speed through the residential areas of Swansea. Their father, Fatty (Huw Ceredig) does work for local businessman and small-time gangster Bryn Cartwright (William Thomas), and falls from a ladder and breaks his leg while working on a roof. Bryn refuses to give the family compensation for Fatty's injury, and the brothers take revenge by urinating on his daughter, Bonny (Jenny Evans) during a singing competition at the local (sadly, now-defunct) nightclub, Barons. This starts off an escalating feud which involves the decapitation of a poodle, and the surprisingly massive explosion of a caravan, culminating in some rather brutal justice inflicted on Bryn and his partner in crime, corrupt cop Terry Walsh (Dougray Scott). I'm not going to go and spoil the entire thing, but what I will say is that things take a rather dark turn, with Julian and Jeremy showing a rather unexpected creative mind for murder, especially given that they appear to be just permanently wasted. As a Swansea resident, I have to say that while the drug use in the film is exaggerated, it does capture the seedier side of Swansea quite well. The scenes of Swansea's nightlife are perhaps too accurate (anyone who has been to Wind Street at its worst will know what I mean), and the accent and rather, erm, colourful way that the characters speak is spot on. It also, however, captures some of the more beautiful aspects of the city, namely its heart (although the Lewis family are dysfunctional, they have a very warm family dynamic), and also the beautiful scenery in the area (visible in the panoramic shots of the city), and I think that any Welshman couldn't watch the funeral scene at the end as the choir sings "Myfanwy" without wiping away a tear. I saw that the film got quite a few bad reviews on the net (and indeed on here). I think possibly some might not get the accents, or indeed the feel of the film - ultimately, to really enjoy the film, you have to have lived in Swansea to get the most out of it, as if you have, a particular location or character will tie in with certain memories you have of the place, whereas otherwise, it might not. It's most definitely worth checking out, and add another star if you're from Swansea!

    During my tenure as chief projectionist of the Commodore Cinema, Aberystwyth, the only film to have received a standing ovation on more than one night for a week's screening. It's a university town so we have a good mix of local punters, students and holiday people. I rest my case. The nineties was, on the whole, a good decade for cinema I think. All we seem to have had since then is a load of cgi filled soulless film equivalent of a fast food outlet (Hancock?). Maybe it's just me getting older. I checked out the "hated it" rating for Twin Town tonight, and was pleasantly surprised to see only two negative reviews receiving two stars or less. Bloody hell. Some bugger's just nicked my car..............

Enhancing the film further was it's great choice of cast. All the characters were perfectly conveyed, and film avoided any bad performances. The music is also something to listen out for, as it stands out as a good piece of work on it's own. I highly recommend Twin Town (especially if you're British), as it's an exciting film experience with a great story, interesting shots, decent actors, and appropriate use of excessive swearing and violence.

    I didn't know where this film was going until I saw the Godfather-esquire poodle's head scene! Then, I knew this was going to be good! The director had a flawless visual sense and the dialogue was equally good- maybe because it was so hard for a Yank to understand. That idiot's attempt to kill the dog by setting it's house on fire, but not before putting on the dead dog's collar because it was classy and "Italian" had me LMHO. The combination of hundreds of old guys singing that nostalgic song by the sea and the "burial by sea" scene was one of the weirdest, funniest things I've ever seen in my life!!! The tacky Petulia Clark songs were perfect, also.

    This is one of my favourite all time films, it is funny, irreverent, unexpected, gritty, real in a surreal way and very very funny. Maybe not everyone got it.. maybe not everyone has been to Wales.. but it captures it so accurately, in a comic book yet real way. It is full of tender moments as well as being brutal and immoral. So many jokes, so many visual gags, and so many really warm and well imagined characters. It is two fingers up to Hollywood, to formulaic movies.. it is in a whole new genre of it own. From the very first scene to its finale it is rich in entertainment, shock, surprise, humour and emotion. This is such a good film... I love it!

    I recall this being referred to as the Welsh attempt at 'Trainspotting' when it first came out; presumably because it came out soon after, took place in a Celtic country and featured drugs... this is an unfair comparison as they are very different films. Set in Swansea it follows two pairs of men; the Lewis Brothers, a couple of layabout car thieves with a taste for class B drugs; and Terry and Greyo, a couple of bent coppers getting involved in the cocaine trade with local Nouveau riche business man Bryn Cartwright. After the Lewis boys hit Terry's car he is determined to get his revenge. The boys meanwhile have got it in for Bryn after he refuses to pay any compensation when their father is hurt on one of his business sites. They start off their cycle of revenge by urinating on Bryn's daughter as she sings at the local karaoke night... things quickly escalate to killing pets and ultimately the boys' parents and sister are killed when Terry is trying to set fire to their dog... from then on things get darker as the boys set about getting their revenge and Terry tries to find somebody else to blame. As stated before this is not 'Trainspotting' so if you expect something like that you will be disappointed, it is however very funny for the most part although you are likely to suffer mood whiplash half way through when people start dying. Real life brothers Llyr and Rhys Ifans do well as the Lewis brothers, bringing a real sense of anarchy to the roles, Dougray Scott is the other most notable actor; bringing a sense of menace to the part of Terry while still being funny. While it is for the most part fairly funny there are few genuinely likable characters; even the ones we are meant to like are criminals! If you are easily offended this probably isn't the film for you but if you aren't put off by a lot of swearing and some fairly offensive behaviour you should have a good laugh.

    Twin Town follows the Lewis brothers also known as the the twins (Jeremy and Julian) played by Rhys Ifans and Llyr Ifans- also brothers in real life although only the former has gone on to forge a successful career in the movies (Notting Hill, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, The Amazing Spider-Man [2012]). Put simply they are delinquent layabouts who are renowned locally for their compulsion to steal cars, get into mischief and take as many tokes as they can from all manner of homemade bongs- utilising everything from shower heads to golf clubs. They live on a caravan site overshadowed by the Swansea industrial works with their parents, sister and dog Cantona (named so after a Welsh football player). The plot revolves around a series of confrontations that start as frivolous but soon escalate to serious between the twins and the local big crook as the twins feel their father, Fatty, has been wronged. Throw in bent copper Terry with delusions of grandeur played well by Dougray Scott, a karaoke king, some cocaine and a poodle and you've got yourselves the making of an intriguing movie. The movie unsurprisingly is riddled with Welsh references that some people may be unfamiliar with and understanding the lingo might take a couple of minutes if you have never heard a Welshman before but hang in there as your patience will be rewarded. What I particularly like about this movie is that its rough around the edges and very realistic as you can imagine these types of people existing in the real world. It's also well known for containing its high usage of the word f'k summed up brilliantly with the first line of the movie- "F'ing dead, f'ing dead as f'k". It is to Twin Town what alcohol is to Withnail And I. As you can therefore imagine the script is not elegant and may not be to everyone's liking but there is some good dialogue thrown in to get you laughing and the development of the plot is well thought out occasionally throwing you in the wrong direction and leading to a well concluded climax. Twin Town is a unique dark comedy that's passed too many people by and this needs to be rectified as it's a very good movie that has just the right amount of comedy, violence and in the Lewis brothers a couple of cracking, if not slightly disturbing, characters that you end up getting behind and really connecting with.

    Quite simply, this is the funniest and most quoted movie we've ever seen, and remains an absolute must see. "Cup of tea boys..." While on the first run through, it might seem like a swear-fest, this is a movie which deserves to be watched time and time again. For one reason or another , Twin Town avoided mainstream success, and yet at the same time developed a cult following, which, to this day remains underground. Understandably, this would have never been a film to make big box office bucks, but I assume that was never the intention. Written as sharply as todays modern sit-coms, and far sharper than most recent films, it remains understated and extremely dark at times, while still managing to make you laugh out loud repeatably and rewind to watch again. The last few scenes, a testament to the confidence of the writers, are some of the best. My only hope is that we get to see more of the not-so-famous actors that appear throughout, those that play Greyo, Adie and Dai etc, because without their contribution, the movie wouldn't have been so complete. Keith Allen should be placed high upon a pedestal, and pestered continually until he agrees to write again, be it Welsh or not. "You reckon this boat'll get us to Morocco...".

    Whereas the two cities in the Central Lowlands of Scotland had Trainspotting, then Wales's second city of Swansea had Twin Town. Despite looking quite promising with the locals, this film in fact fails to achieve all expectations of Trainspotting and reviews were patchy that in some cases, the local cinema goers around area where it was filmed claim it wasn't good mainly because it contained too much bad language. I was expecting them to be wrong at first but then I admit that they were right. If Trainspotting has considerable use of strong language with a cert 18, then Twin Town is in fact far more excessive in swearing and in one occasion the language is sometimes poorly overused together with a rather poor plot and therefore making it a bit of a dud film. Much of the younger local viewers love Twin Town and pompously claim it to be a classic and as it is known that in the 1990s, any particular area where the film was made had a high rate of car crime.

    Just wanted to say to the guy who thought this film had a bad ending, you clearly don't understand the essence of escalation. "Revenge is a dish best served cold" you will note is the opening lines of the Kill Bill Series, not a black comedy granted but a similar themed film. The whole point of revenge is to go one better than what was done to you, when someone blows up your entire family, albeit unintentionally then what better way to dish out the moment when said opponent in the battle of revenge meets his maker, than by carrying out your dead fathers wish. In my mind this is the ultimate black comedy, a biased decision I'm sure growing up on the welsh border and getting an extra tickle from the welsh eccentricities, but from a writing point of view, perfectly executed!

    Some like to call Twin Town the "Welsh Trainspotting". I would disagree - while it has some similarities such as prolific drug use and a bleak portrayal of a city in the United Kingdom (in this case Swansea, with bits of Port Talbot), the two films are quite different. Twin Town takes place in 90s Swansea, where brothers Julian (Llyr Ifans) and Jeremy Lewis (Rhys Ifans) live a carefree existence smoking weed and driving stolen cars at high speed through the residential areas of Swansea. Their father, Fatty (Huw Ceredig) does work for local businessman and small-time gangster Bryn Cartwright (William Thomas), and falls from a ladder and breaks his leg while working on a roof. Bryn refuses to give the family compensation for Fatty's injury, and the brothers take revenge by urinating on his daughter, Bonny (Jenny Evans) during a singing competition at the local (sadly, now-defunct) nightclub, Barons. This starts off an escalating feud which involves the decapitation of a poodle, and the surprisingly massive explosion of a caravan, culminating in some rather brutal justice inflicted on Bryn and his partner in crime, corrupt cop Terry Walsh (Dougray Scott). I'm not going to go and spoil the entire thing, but what I will say is that things take a rather dark turn, with Julian and Jeremy showing a rather unexpected creative mind for murder, especially given that they appear to be just permanently wasted. As a Swansea resident, I have to say that while the drug use in the film is exaggerated, it does capture the seedier side of Swansea quite well. The scenes of Swansea's nightlife are perhaps too accurate (anyone who has been to Wind Street at its worst will know what I mean), and the accent and rather, erm, colourful way that the characters speak is spot on. It also, however, captures some of the more beautiful aspects of the city, namely its heart (although the Lewis family are dysfunctional, they have a very warm family dynamic), and also the beautiful scenery in the area (visible in the panoramic shots of the city), and I think that any Welshman couldn't watch the funeral scene at the end as the choir sings "Myfanwy" without wiping away a tear. I saw that the film got quite a few bad reviews on the net (and indeed on here). I think possibly some might not get the accents, or indeed the feel of the film - ultimately, to really enjoy the film, you have to have lived in Swansea to get the most out of it, as if you have, a particular location or character will tie in with certain memories you have of the place, whereas otherwise, it might not. It's most definitely worth checking out, and add another star if you're from Swansea!

    During my tenure as chief projectionist of the Commodore Cinema, Aberystwyth, the only film to have received a standing ovation on more than one night for a week's screening. It's a university town so we have a good mix of local punters, students and holiday people. I rest my case. The nineties was, on the whole, a good decade for cinema I think. All we seem to have had since then is a load of cgi filled soulless film equivalent of a fast food outlet (Hancock?). Maybe it's just me getting older. I checked out the "hated it" rating for Twin Town tonight, and was pleasantly surprised to see only two negative reviews receiving two stars or less. Bloody hell. Some bugger's just nicked my car..............

    The film has everything you'd want it to have. Especially if you're British. Probably more of a bloke's film, but still fun for everyone. The story is brilliant, and so accurately welsh. Every minor detail adds to the whole experience. The film progresses like a serious drama and seems to come out with brilliant comedy without even trying. As well as the actual storyline being funny, little quirks about each character and even the attention to welsh detail makes you laugh. Not only is it well written, it's also beautifully filmed, and makes great use of the camera. The film encompasses a huge range of interesting shots.
