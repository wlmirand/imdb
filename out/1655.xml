 <storyline>
  Kathy is married to Peter. Now she can't help but wonder how things could have been if she got together with her old boyfriend, Tom. Being married prevents from doing that so she asks her friend, Emily to go to him and see if she can sleep with him then tell Kathy how it was. When Emily tells Kathy that things were awesome, their friendship suffers, at the same so does Kathy's marriage. Things get even more complicated when Emily learns she's pregnant, and she's not certain if it's Tom's or her boyfriend, Elliot.

    Kathy is a bookkeeper in Portland, Oregon who has two children, Gina and Hannah, with her science professor husband Peter. Her 15-year high school reunion is coming up, and she can't help but wonder what life would be like with her old boyfriend Tom. Kathy's best friend Emily agrees to go to Denver, where Tom lives, and investigate what he is like. Emily comes home from Denver claiming to have had wild sex with Tom. Meanwhile, Emily's younger artist boyfriend Elliot is nice but he and Emily break up over his lack of interest in boring stuff. Miscommunication results in a lot of laughs later. And it just happens that Elliot is going to Denver for his job. This sets up some wild situations. This is pretty good most of the time. Some of the jokes didn't work for me. In particular, I didn't care for the women's obsession with Brad Pitt's body. I get that if it were the other way around, I would understand. But this just wasn't part of the appeal for me. I've always like Harley Jane Kozak, from the time she was a college professor on "The Guiding Light". She always has such a pleasant personality and she's attractive, though not beautiful. She does well here. Pitt does a good job too and is mostly pleasant. Some of the best comedy comes during Kathy's fantasies or nightmares. Though in one case, Kathy is having neither a nightmare nor a fantasy. She is actually wearing a smoking hot dress that a hooker might wear, with a wild hairstyle. I don't really think of Kozak as sexy, and while I got the joke when her husband didn't notice when she put on a sexy nightie and behaved in an alluring way, this is just a standard joke with married couples and I was able to appreciate it without being turned on by Kozak. There is one particularly funny scene where Kathy takes a drug not intended for her. Even though there are kids, and a kids' birthday party, kids that age shouldn't watch this. Some of the sexual humor is quite potent. I had a good time, mostly.

    They say you can't miss what you never had, but one woman wants to put that idea to the test in this romantic comedy entitled,The Favor.It stars Harley Jane Kozak,Elizabeth McGovern,Bill Pullman and Brad Pitt.The movie was written by Sara Parriott and Josann McGibbon, and directed by Donald Petrie. Kathy has seemingly been happily married to Peter, but their relationship has grown routine. She cannot help but wonder what would happen if she ever got together with her high school sweetheart, Tom, who she had never slept with. Being married prevents her from acting on that, so she asks her friend, Emily, to look Tom up when she goes to Denver, and to sleep with him, then tell Kathy what it was like. Emily does this, but when she tells Kathy that Tom is awesome and they had sex all night, their friendship suffers, as does Kathy's marriage. Things become even more complicated when Emily learns she is pregnant, and is uncertain if Tom or her boyfriend, Elliot is the father. This is a poorly made movie.It started at first as smart and intriguing.Suddenly,it made a U-turn and turned into a screwball comedy.The only redeeming thing about it is it features Brad Pitt in his early work before he became a superstar.

    I remember when I was around the age of 14, this movie used to be on once in a while... on basic cable! Every time it was on, I always watched and enjoyed every single minute. To this day, I still do. This movie was the reason I wanted to learn how to play the harmonica... not to mention why I got into wearing flannel. Let's face it: I'm a born romantic and I was hooked from the first watch. I have it on VHS (which by the way, was a very difficult find) and I refuse to lose it. I give this underrated great a 9 out of 10.

    An amusing bit of fluff for a "chick flick." Guys, this is a good date movie! Enough Brad Pitt and silly love crap for them, but amusing enough for us. No gratuitous nudity but HEY, you can't have everything. An unknown actress named Harley Jane Kozak is the star of this film, portraying every man's dream wife - sexy, intelligent, feisty and funny (all in a charmingly unpredictable package) - while at the same time being a great mother. It is sad that Kozak soon gave up acting for good to raise her own family. Watching this film makes me believe she deserved better than obscurity. As usual, Brad Pitt displays the talent that would soon make him a superstar, and Bill Pullman also gives a decent performance. The least talented of the four major players is Elizabeth McGovern. She doesn't necessarily give a bad performance, but rather fails to make the role her own. She could have easily been replaced by any other competent actress without altering the chemistry between the characters. Perhaps another actress would have turned in a more memorable performance. McGovern is one of those actresses of whom most people have heard, and yet few can name anything she has ever been in. As usual with movies aimed toward a female audience, the plot is silly and at times nonsensical. As always, at least one man has to be portrayed as a manipulative scumbag with one thing on his mind while all the female characters are decent and loving and emotionally complex. Thankfully though, this film doesn't take itself too seriously. All in all, despite being a "chick flick," this movie is worth watching - perhaps even twice.

    This movie is shown too often on cable; I thought it was made in the 1980's; but, no, it was circa 1994. If it WAS the '80's, I could excuse its superfluousness. As other reviewers have described the age-old plot; I need not get into it. Bill Pullman is usually in good projects, so this is a sincere disappointment. Harley Kozak (who??) plays the bleached blonde wife; Elizabeth McGovern the "&ouml;ther" woman. Beyond this, there is no plot, you may well turn on "&Auml;s the World Turns" and see the same show tomorrow. The "one hit wonder" Billy Ray Cyrus is also a bit player; I really don't know who the target demographic for this movie is...maybe housewives in Arkansas with a net worth of $10,000.00 or less. This movie is a complete insult to the audience; rent "The Accused" with Bill Pullman, instead, at least he gets to act in it.

    This movie was actually good. I don't personally know anyone who saw it before I turned them onto it. Elizabeth McGovern was great in this one. She did great job of being the woman most women would love to be like (I.e..."Remember when we said we'd stop when it wasn't fun anymore? Well, it's not fun anymore"). Bill Pullman was very good as the silly husband with his cute little harmonica. Harley Kozak is good in this too(Good enough for me to be surprised that I haven't seen her in anything else). The only character that didn't impress me was Brad Pitt. It's a comedy about a married woman who wonders what her old high school boyfriend is up to now. Haven't we all wondered something along that line ? :)

    O my God. This is so bad it's nearly funny. Yes, nearly. The twists and all the clich&eacute;'s are in here. I just saw the movie with a friend (because we had breakfast and put the TV on) and just kept shaking are heads. Harley Jane Kozak is so overacting it's just pathetic. And why Bill Pullman is playing in ANY film is beyond me. The guy has ONE look. The "i lost my glasses and now i have to squeeze my eyes to see anything" look. Brad Pitt just wasn't convincing. He's done far more better jobs than this. This film is just BAD. No surprise from a director who gave us 'gems' as 'Mystic Pizza' and 'my favorite martian'. Sorry, i hate to be all negative about a film but this one gave me no choice.

    I loved it, watched it twice last week and hope it comes on again! I had never heard of it before and it just came on, soon as it started I knew I would like it. Bill Pullman is wonderful in everything I've seen him in, and Brad Pitt, what can you say he's gorgeous and a wonderful actor.

    Lemme just say right of the bat that this movie was so cute:o) And quite unpredictable. Seeing Brad Pitt was definitely a sight for sore eyes though, lol. A gal loves her husband, but thinks of her ex boyfriend from high school, who slept with her friend after she asked her to, who has a boyfriend (sort of) who she ends up having a baby with... yeah, that's called CONFUSION, lol. But I like where you have to remember and think and take a step back and realize certain things... Definitely deserve a least a star of two more on IMDB. Great movie, see it:o)

    ...but it wasn't great, either. An okay, light-hearted, feel-good comedy. Had a little too much TV-sitcomishness about it, and the main character lady was a little too neurotic, and her husband was a little too suspicious in a TV sitcom sort of way. But all of that was just "a little" and overall it was fun to watch. Mind you -- we caught it on cable -- I wouldn't have wanted to rent it! I give it a B-
