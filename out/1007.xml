 <sinopse>
  An aspiring director and the marginally-talented amateur cast of a hokey small-town Missouri musical production go overboard when they learn that someone from Broadway will be in attendance.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A town of Blaine, Missouri is preparing for celebrations of its 150th anniversary. Corky St.Clair, an off-off-off-off-off-Broadway director is putting together an amateur theater show about the town's history, starring a local dentist, a couple of travel agents, a Dairy Queen waitress, and a car repairman. He invites a Broadway theater critic Mr. Guffman to see the opening night of the show.

    Classic Christopher Guest directing, excellent improv acting, hilarious songs during the play in the movie, and a great start to a line of movies that Guest directed in this way. Notable scenes: Eugene Levy's impression of Johnny Carson's impression of an Indian, Catherine O'Hara's bangs (straight up!), the first of Fred Willard's impressions of how TV personalities talk (which he later reprised in "A Mighty Wind"), Parker Posey's character talking ad nauseum about Dairy Queen creations, and Eugene Levy's martian song at the play. Too many parts to mention here, you'll just have to see for yourself. It should be noted that the Family Guy character of Bruce sounds exactly like Guest's Corky St. Clair. This is one of the better Guest movies to watch, so I don't think you'll be disappointed.

    A small town in Missouri is celebrating the 150 years of its existence, and the people gather together to make a remarkable musical play telling the story of the city celebrating its great historical moments. In the hands of writer and director Christopher Guest it is a strange comedy with very traces of originality, after all he goes back to the recurring documentary style filmmaking with all the main characters getting interviewed, and the whole thing takes too long to become a enjoyable film. Christopher Guest plays the director of the play; Eugene Levy plays a dentist with notable singing skills; Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara play a couple who is going to be part of this show, along with Parker Posey, Matt Keeslar, Bob Balaban and others. The movie begins with the selection of the participants and countless interviews with the people involved in this play. Then it evolves to the first rehearsals and the first problems involving budget, and a actor who couldn't perform on the day of the presentation. Along with it we know this eccentric town and its peculiar habitants telling stories about the city and their lives. The biggest happening for these people with this play is that a guy named Guffman will come to watch it and this guy happens to be very famous for producing plays on Braodway. So everybody wants to make their best and perform the best show ever made. Guest is known for a strange and sophisticated sense for comedy, and sometimes it's a good thing when everybody really knows what's happening in all the scenes. In the case of "Waiting for Guffman" the comedy took too long to be funny and the interviews once the greatest thing created by Guest in "This is Spinal Tap" was boring and unfunny. The scenes where the characters had dialog with each other worked way better, but some things could have been used more, explored more, developed to be funnier as it were e.g. the scene at the dinner where Fred Willard's character says that he made "a penis reduction" because the thing was too big. The joke went so fast that I was expecting more of it and then nothing. But I must say that this film didn't disappoint me in the so awaited play. It was the best thing in the whole film, it wasn't a disaster as it might seem predicted (after all it's a show of amateurs). It was interesting, creative and very amusing. The casting was great (both in the play and in the movie). It is one of those films that in the beginning doesn't offer much but you must not give up, just keep watching and you'll be glad for it. Among the funniest parts my favorite is near the final credits when Guest character shows lots of toys based on films (a lunch box of the film "The Remains of the Day", Andrew McCarthy and Anthony Michael Hall little statues, and the tiny toys recreating a scene of "My Dinner With Andre"). Nice film. 6/10

    I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. This has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended. Must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch it. The concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on American Idol. You watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. So how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an American Idol tryout? It would be pointless as this movie was. The use of improv is over-rated. We've all been in that setting where a group of friends get on a roll and everyone is cracking up with tears in the their eyes. I feel that is improv. Improv can't be turned on just because the camera is rolling as this film proves. If you like that Drew Carey hosted show of improv, you'll probably like this film. Overall the jokes were poor, the improv was sophomoric, and the over-acting by Guest and company was campy...and those are my compliments of this drivel. If a guy playing a trumpet AND the kettle drum at the same time is funny to you, fine. For me, I prefer more heady stuff like "I Love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw". But remember, I think SNL lost its humor in the 1980's, so maybe you'll like this G-rated humor. I kept waiting for a person to identify himself as the zoo keeper and then tell us there was no zoo in town. That's the humor you can expect. My only wish was that I could give this a minus rating.

    This is a fairly enjoyable film, but honestly I don't think it's deserving of all the praise it gets. If I could sum it up in one word, it would be 'mild.' The story is mildly interesting, and it follows a group of small-town folks who are mildly quirky, putting on a play that is pretty bad, but only mildly funny. Part of the problem, I think, is that it's somewhat one-joke-- the characters are stupid, and they're putting on a bad play. Beyond that, there's not much to laugh at. There are a few moments of comedy, but most of it is just repeating the same ideas which aren't original or funny in the first place-- Fred Willard's character is self-obsessed and obnoxious, Catherine O'Hara is blindly supportive of him, Corky St. Clair is flamboyantly gay, etc. It seems clich&eacute;'d to compare this (or any improvisational comedy) to Spinal Tap, but the key difference between them is that in Spinal Tap, the characters say funny things. In this, the fact that the characters are stupid/vain/whatever is supposed to be the joke. And it gets old very quickly. Watching the film, it seems like the play is going to be a hilarious climax, but it's not nearly as bad as it could be. The songs themselves are pretty funny, because they're so cheesy and typical of amateur musical theater, but being subjected to 15+ minutes of the same joke -- these characters are bad actors and the lyrics are cheesy -- is tiresome. Also, I'm guessing the ending is supposed to be surprising, but it's telegraphed pretty clearly, and you can see it coming a mile away.

    Writer-director Christopher Guest's timing and peculiar sense of humor are purposefully erratic--and it takes some time for him to get an audience off the dime and into the perplexing spirit of his cinematic occasions. Guest is well-attuned to the colorful eccentricities of 'ordinary' folks, yet his knowing nature borders on smirking, and I'm not a big fan of obnoxiousness--no matter how talented the participants. Mockumentary about a small town acting troupe putting on a musical production does benefit from some great players (particularly Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, and the effortlessly funny Catherine O'Hara). However Guest, himself a co-star--giving a rather offensive performance as gay theater director Corky--does not have the pizazz to bring off scenes of uncomfortable ineptitude. One waits in queasy vain for a pay-off that never comes. I assume Guest wants to have some comedic punch within these improvisational set-ups; if so, he's punching with two limp wrists, and his film is awfully long even at 84 minutes. *1/2 from ****

    "Waiting for Guffman" (1996): THE FINEST assemblage of straight-faced comedians in all of history, create one of THE funniest movies EVER. "Waiting for Guffman" is about humans with more than enough faith...AND self-delusions. Christopher Guest is the driving force, both in front of and behind the camera, and along with Eugene Levy, portray a small town's population creating a small play about their small history, which is a VERY BIG deal to them. Guest's consistent theme (throughout his films) is about humans who don't have enough insight or talent to spot the lack of it within themselves. There is an incredible blind faith, tenderness and embarrassing, misguided drive within these people. And yet, within their little world, they support the dreams for one another, and move through their lives with solid delusion. "This is Spinal Tap", "Best in Show", and "A Mighty Wind" are other great examples. Guest also has the sense to call back his actors for further projects. This is brilliant work.

    This is the first of several films that Christopher Guest and his friends have made using a very unusual style. Instead of a clearly defined script, some very talented actors (such as Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard and others) took a script idea and improvised throughout. The film was then created using the best bits and I can honestly say that there is nothing like this film. While some of the jokes are very, very dry and occasionally fall flat, there is a subtle charm and wit to the film as you follow a group of 3rd rate local actors who have insane visions of Broadway. The film is ostensibly about a very local stage production about the founding of some small town. While these sort of pageants have been ubiquitous in small town America, this one is unique because supposedly a guy by the name of Guffman is coming to town and plans two see it. Guffman, it seems, is from Broadway and the cast has the temerity to believe that maybe they'll impress him so much that they'll become major stars. Considering the quality of the acting is well below that of an average high school production, this is very absurd. Yet, although ridiculous, there is a certain something in many of these people that is very likable so there is some depth to the film--you aren't just laughing at yokels who have ridiculous aspirations. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and think that people who like their humor subtle and perhaps a bit painful will enjoy this film. People who prefer broad comedy probably won't enjoy this very much.

    Thanks be to cable for reviving this very non-commercial film. It's a sweet send-up of small town America that comes across like an extended version of Second City Review or Saturday Night Live. Sure, some of the parody is pointed, but it's never mean-spirited. Blaine, Missouri, in the heart of the state, is having its 150th anniversary, and by golly the town's theatrical types are going to do it up right. Never mind that the talent is spread pretty thin from the stage struck town dentist (Eugene Levy), to travel agents (Fred Willard & Catherine O'Hara), to Dairy Queen princess (Parker Posey). Or that their inspiration comes from an off- off-off Broadway impresario (Christopher Guest), "temporarily on leave" from the Big Apple. He may not be your typical macho mid-western type, but he did serve on a destroyer and does have a wife, somewhere, so he says. It's all handled with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek, as we watch the cast lumber, stagger, and flounce through their dance routines and dream of Real stage success. Naturally, we expect the final result, the pageant performance before the whole town, to nose-dive., But it doesn't. Instead, the stage performance comes across rather sweetly, with just the right amount of unpolished success that brings the whole town to its feet in a boffo finale. What happens then is comical and not too surprising, considering all the low rent motels surrounding Hollywood. Levy, Willard, and the others are uniformly excellent as would be expected of veteran sketch artists. I don't know who to thank for the movie that had no obvious future, commercial or otherwise. But for darn sure this little sleeper goes into my tape library for repeated viewing.

    Waiting for Guffman is a mockumentary about a small town putting on a production in hopes of making it to Broadway. This new acting trope is led by rather eccentric Corky St. Clair(Christopher Guest), and consists of two travel agents(who have never left town), A Dairy Queen employee, a rather geeky dentist with a lazy eye, and so much more. The movie follows these cast of players with the support of the town, as they put on a production called, "Red, White, and Blaine"(Blaine being the town they live in). What is best about this movie is that the only scripted scenes were that of the actual play. Everything else is completely ad-libbed which makes this movie genuine and just downright funny. Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, in my opinion, are purely brilliant. The plot works, the characters are so offbeat and hysterical that I can still recall almost every single line they said. All in all, Waiting for Guffman is perhaps one of, if not the, funniest movie I have ever seen. 9/10.

    It's all there. The ridiculous characters who live a ridiculous delusion centered around a particular niche of people. The dry, awkward, intentional but not portrayed to be that way humor. It's classic Christopher Guest mockumentary and it's exactly what "Waiting for Guffman" is. The only thing is that Guest never goes the extra step to make these characters anything more than hysterical and it's there for the taking. "Guffman" centers around a fictional Missouri town called Blaine in which a local theater director Corky St. Clair (Guest) has agreed to create and direct a show about the history of the town for its 150th anniversary celebration. The film goes through the whole process by interviewing everyone involved and following St. Clair as it all happens. When they hear that a Broadway scout of sorts named Mort Guffman is to attend their performance, they all get incredibly excited. Guest and his usual cast of actors playing yet another set of actors are great once again in this film. Eugene Levy is great as the town's dentist who discovers his theatrical side when he's cast in the show. Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara continue to apply their off-beat senses of humor to their roles as a husband and wife that run a travel agency despite never having left Blaine in their lives. Parker Posey also demonstrates a great subtle humor to her part as a young Dairy Queen employee. The greatest statement that Guest makes with this film is that it's completely absurd that these people expect their lives to become anything more than dull. You follow them and they're so passionate about it despite clearly having no talent. But at the same time, Guest never really explores that. He just shows you the process of putting on the show in this film and relies on humor to carry you through it. With such great actors and characters like in all his films, it shocks me to see it all get wasted or at the least never fully developed. We never get to see these characters for who they really are despite the fact that we enjoy laughing at them.

Considering the quality of the acting is well below that of an average high school production, this is very absurd. Yet, although ridiculous, there is a certain something in many of these people that is very likable so there is some depth to the film--you aren't just laughing at yokels who have ridiculous aspirations. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and think that people who like their humor subtle and perhaps a bit painful will enjoy this film. People who prefer broad comedy probably won't enjoy this very much.

    Thanks be to cable for reviving this very non-commercial film. It's a sweet send-up of small town America that comes across like an extended version of Second City Review or Saturday Night Live. Sure, some of the parody is pointed, but it's never mean-spirited. Blaine, Missouri, in the heart of the state, is having its 150th anniversary, and by golly the town's theatrical types are going to do it up right. Never mind that the talent is spread pretty thin from the stage struck town dentist (Eugene Levy), to travel agents (Fred Willard & Catherine O'Hara), to Dairy Queen princess (Parker Posey). Or that their inspiration comes from an off- off-off Broadway impresario (Christopher Guest), "temporarily on leave" from the Big Apple. He may not be your typical macho mid-western type, but he did serve on a destroyer and does have a wife, somewhere, so he says. It's all handled with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek, as we watch the cast lumber, stagger, and flounce through their dance routines and dream of Real stage success. Naturally, we expect the final result, the pageant performance before the whole town, to nose-dive., But it doesn't. Instead, the stage performance comes across rather sweetly, with just the right amount of unpolished success that brings the whole town to its feet in a boffo finale. What happens then is comical and not too surprising, considering all the low rent motels surrounding Hollywood. Levy, Willard, and the others are uniformly excellent as would be expected of veteran sketch artists. I don't know who to thank for the movie that had no obvious future, commercial or otherwise. But for darn sure this little sleeper goes into my tape library for repeated viewing.

    Waiting for Guffman is a mockumentary about a small town putting on a production in hopes of making it to Broadway. This new acting trope is led by rather eccentric Corky St. Clair(Christopher Guest), and consists of two travel agents(who have never left town), A Dairy Queen employee, a rather geeky dentist with a lazy eye, and so much more. The movie follows these cast of players with the support of the town, as they put on a production called, "Red, White, and Blaine"(Blaine being the town they live in). What is best about this movie is that the only scripted scenes were that of the actual play. Everything else is completely ad-libbed which makes this movie genuine and just downright funny. Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, in my opinion, are purely brilliant. The plot works, the characters are so offbeat and hysterical that I can still recall almost every single line they said. All in all, Waiting for Guffman is perhaps one of, if not the, funniest movie I have ever seen. 9/10.

    It's all there. The ridiculous characters who live a ridiculous delusion centered around a particular niche of people. The dry, awkward, intentional but not portrayed to be that way humor. It's classic Christopher Guest mockumentary and it's exactly what "Waiting for Guffman" is. The only thing is that Guest never goes the extra step to make these characters anything more than hysterical and it's there for the taking. "Guffman" centers around a fictional Missouri town called Blaine in which a local theater director Corky St. Clair (Guest) has agreed to create and direct a show about the history of the town for its 150th anniversary celebration. The film goes through the whole process by interviewing everyone involved and following St. Clair as it all happens. When they hear that a Broadway scout of sorts named Mort Guffman is to attend their performance, they all get incredibly excited. Guest and his usual cast of actors playing yet another set of actors are great once again in this film. Eugene Levy is great as the town's dentist who discovers his theatrical side when he's cast in the show. Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara continue to apply their off-beat senses of humor to their roles as a husband and wife that run a travel agency despite never having left Blaine in their lives. Parker Posey also demonstrates a great subtle humor to her part as a young Dairy Queen employee. The greatest statement that Guest makes with this film is that it's completely absurd that these people expect their lives to become anything more than dull. You follow them and they're so passionate about it despite clearly having no talent. But at the same time, Guest never really explores that. He just shows you the process of putting on the show in this film and relies on humor to carry you through it. With such great actors and characters like in all his films, it shocks me to see it all get wasted or at the least never fully developed. We never get to see these characters for who they really are despite the fact that we enjoy laughing at them.

    Classic Christopher Guest directing, excellent improv acting, hilarious songs during the play in the movie, and a great start to a line of movies that Guest directed in this way. Notable scenes: Eugene Levy's impression of Johnny Carson's impression of an Indian, Catherine O'Hara's bangs (straight up!), the first of Fred Willard's impressions of how TV personalities talk (which he later reprised in "A Mighty Wind"), Parker Posey's character talking ad nauseum about Dairy Queen creations, and Eugene Levy's martian song at the play. Too many parts to mention here, you'll just have to see for yourself. It should be noted that the Family Guy character of Bruce sounds exactly like Guest's Corky St. Clair. This is one of the better Guest movies to watch, so I don't think you'll be disappointed.

    A small town in Missouri is celebrating the 150 years of its existence, and the people gather together to make a remarkable musical play telling the story of the city celebrating its great historical moments. In the hands of writer and director Christopher Guest it is a strange comedy with very traces of originality, after all he goes back to the recurring documentary style filmmaking with all the main characters getting interviewed, and the whole thing takes too long to become a enjoyable film. Christopher Guest plays the director of the play; Eugene Levy plays a dentist with notable singing skills; Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara play a couple who is going to be part of this show, along with Parker Posey, Matt Keeslar, Bob Balaban and others. The movie begins with the selection of the participants and countless interviews with the people involved in this play. Then it evolves to the first rehearsals and the first problems involving budget, and a actor who couldn't perform on the day of the presentation. Along with it we know this eccentric town and its peculiar habitants telling stories about the city and their lives. The biggest happening for these people with this play is that a guy named Guffman will come to watch it and this guy happens to be very famous for producing plays on Braodway. So everybody wants to make their best and perform the best show ever made. Guest is known for a strange and sophisticated sense for comedy, and sometimes it's a good thing when everybody really knows what's happening in all the scenes. In the case of "Waiting for Guffman" the comedy took too long to be funny and the interviews once the greatest thing created by Guest in "This is Spinal Tap" was boring and unfunny. The scenes where the characters had dialog with each other worked way better, but some things could have been used more, explored more, developed to be funnier as it were e.g. the scene at the dinner where Fred Willard's character says that he made "a penis reduction" because the thing was too big. The joke went so fast that I was expecting more of it and then nothing. But I must say that this film didn't disappoint me in the so awaited play. It was the best thing in the whole film, it wasn't a disaster as it might seem predicted (after all it's a show of amateurs). It was interesting, creative and very amusing. The casting was great (both in the play and in the movie). It is one of those films that in the beginning doesn't offer much but you must not give up, just keep watching and you'll be glad for it. Among the funniest parts my favorite is near the final credits when Guest character shows lots of toys based on films (a lunch box of the film "The Remains of the Day", Andrew McCarthy and Anthony Michael Hall little statues, and the tiny toys recreating a scene of "My Dinner With Andre"). Nice film. 6/10

    I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. This has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended. Must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch it. The concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on American Idol. You watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. So how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an American Idol tryout? It would be pointless as this movie was. The use of improv is over-rated. We've all been in that setting where a group of friends get on a roll and everyone is cracking up with tears in the their eyes. I feel that is improv. Improv can't be turned on just because the camera is rolling as this film proves. If you like that Drew Carey hosted show of improv, you'll probably like this film. Overall the jokes were poor, the improv was sophomoric, and the over-acting by Guest and company was campy...and those are my compliments of this drivel. If a guy playing a trumpet AND the kettle drum at the same time is funny to you, fine. For me, I prefer more heady stuff like "I Love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw". But remember, I think SNL lost its humor in the 1980's, so maybe you'll like this G-rated humor. I kept waiting for a person to identify himself as the zoo keeper and then tell us there was no zoo in town. That's the humor you can expect. My only wish was that I could give this a minus rating.

    This is a fairly enjoyable film, but honestly I don't think it's deserving of all the praise it gets. If I could sum it up in one word, it would be 'mild.' The story is mildly interesting, and it follows a group of small-town folks who are mildly quirky, putting on a play that is pretty bad, but only mildly funny. Part of the problem, I think, is that it's somewhat one-joke-- the characters are stupid, and they're putting on a bad play. Beyond that, there's not much to laugh at. There are a few moments of comedy, but most of it is just repeating the same ideas which aren't original or funny in the first place-- Fred Willard's character is self-obsessed and obnoxious, Catherine O'Hara is blindly supportive of him, Corky St. Clair is flamboyantly gay, etc. It seems clich&eacute;'d to compare this (or any improvisational comedy) to Spinal Tap, but the key difference between them is that in Spinal Tap, the characters say funny things. In this, the fact that the characters are stupid/vain/whatever is supposed to be the joke. And it gets old very quickly. Watching the film, it seems like the play is going to be a hilarious climax, but it's not nearly as bad as it could be. The songs themselves are pretty funny, because they're so cheesy and typical of amateur musical theater, but being subjected to 15+ minutes of the same joke -- these characters are bad actors and the lyrics are cheesy -- is tiresome. Also, I'm guessing the ending is supposed to be surprising, but it's telegraphed pretty clearly, and you can see it coming a mile away.

    Writer-director Christopher Guest's timing and peculiar sense of humor are purposefully erratic--and it takes some time for him to get an audience off the dime and into the perplexing spirit of his cinematic occasions. Guest is well-attuned to the colorful eccentricities of 'ordinary' folks, yet his knowing nature borders on smirking, and I'm not a big fan of obnoxiousness--no matter how talented the participants. Mockumentary about a small town acting troupe putting on a musical production does benefit from some great players (particularly Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, and the effortlessly funny Catherine O'Hara). However Guest, himself a co-star--giving a rather offensive performance as gay theater director Corky--does not have the pizazz to bring off scenes of uncomfortable ineptitude. One waits in queasy vain for a pay-off that never comes. I assume Guest wants to have some comedic punch within these improvisational set-ups; if so, he's punching with two limp wrists, and his film is awfully long even at 84 minutes. *1/2 from ****

    "Waiting for Guffman" (1996): THE FINEST assemblage of straight-faced comedians in all of history, create one of THE funniest movies EVER. "Waiting for Guffman" is about humans with more than enough faith...AND self-delusions. Christopher Guest is the driving force, both in front of and behind the camera, and along with Eugene Levy, portray a small town's population creating a small play about their small history, which is a VERY BIG deal to them. Guest's consistent theme (throughout his films) is about humans who don't have enough insight or talent to spot the lack of it within themselves. There is an incredible blind faith, tenderness and embarrassing, misguided drive within these people. And yet, within their little world, they support the dreams for one another, and move through their lives with solid delusion. "This is Spinal Tap", "Best in Show", and "A Mighty Wind" are other great examples. Guest also has the sense to call back his actors for further projects. This is brilliant work.

    This is the first of several films that Christopher Guest and his friends have made using a very unusual style. Instead of a clearly defined script, some very talented actors (such as Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard and others) took a script idea and improvised throughout. The film was then created using the best bits and I can honestly say that there is nothing like this film. While some of the jokes are very, very dry and occasionally fall flat, there is a subtle charm and wit to the film as you follow a group of 3rd rate local actors who have insane visions of Broadway. The film is ostensibly about a very local stage production about the founding of some small town. While these sort of pageants have been ubiquitous in small town America, this one is unique because supposedly a guy by the name of Guffman is coming to town and plans two see it. Guffman, it seems, is from Broadway and the cast has the temerity to believe that maybe they'll impress him so much that they'll become major stars. Considering the quality of the acting is well below that of an average high school production, this is very absurd. Yet, although ridiculous, there is a certain something in many of these people that is very likable so there is some depth to the film--you aren't just laughing at yokels who have ridiculous aspirations. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and think that people who like their humor subtle and perhaps a bit painful will enjoy this film. People who prefer broad comedy probably won't enjoy this very much.

    Writer-director Christopher Guest's timing and peculiar sense of humor are purposefully erratic--and it takes some time for him to get an audience off the dime and into the perplexing spirit of his cinematic occasions. Guest is well-attuned to the colorful eccentricities of 'ordinary' folks, yet his knowing nature borders on smirking, and I'm not a big fan of obnoxiousness--no matter how talented the participants. Mockumentary about a small town acting troupe putting on a musical production does benefit from some great players (particularly Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, and the effortlessly funny Catherine O'Hara). However Guest, himself a co-star--giving a rather offensive performance as gay theater director Corky--does not have the pizazz to bring off scenes of uncomfortable ineptitude. One waits in queasy vain for a pay-off that never comes. I assume Guest wants to have some comedic punch within these improvisational set-ups; if so, he's punching with two limp wrists, and his film is awfully long even at 84 minutes. *1/2 from ****

    "Waiting for Guffman" (1996): THE FINEST assemblage of straight-faced comedians in all of history, create one of THE funniest movies EVER. "Waiting for Guffman" is about humans with more than enough faith...AND self-delusions. Christopher Guest is the driving force, both in front of and behind the camera, and along with Eugene Levy, portray a small town's population creating a small play about their small history, which is a VERY BIG deal to them. Guest's consistent theme (throughout his films) is about humans who don't have enough insight or talent to spot the lack of it within themselves. There is an incredible blind faith, tenderness and embarrassing, misguided drive within these people. And yet, within their little world, they support the dreams for one another, and move through their lives with solid delusion. "This is Spinal Tap", "Best in Show", and "A Mighty Wind" are other great examples. Guest also has the sense to call back his actors for further projects. This is brilliant work.

    This is the first of several films that Christopher Guest and his friends have made using a very unusual style. Instead of a clearly defined script, some very talented actors (such as Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard and others) took a script idea and improvised throughout. The film was then created using the best bits and I can honestly say that there is nothing like this film. While some of the jokes are very, very dry and occasionally fall flat, there is a subtle charm and wit to the film as you follow a group of 3rd rate local actors who have insane visions of Broadway. The film is ostensibly about a very local stage production about the founding of some small town. While these sort of pageants have been ubiquitous in small town America, this one is unique because supposedly a guy by the name of Guffman is coming to town and plans two see it. Guffman, it seems, is from Broadway and the cast has the temerity to believe that maybe they'll impress him so much that they'll become major stars. Considering the quality of the acting is well below that of an average high school production, this is very absurd. Yet, although ridiculous, there is a certain something in many of these people that is very likable so there is some depth to the film--you aren't just laughing at yokels who have ridiculous aspirations. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and think that people who like their humor subtle and perhaps a bit painful will enjoy this film. People who prefer broad comedy probably won't enjoy this very much.

    Thanks be to cable for reviving this very non-commercial film. It's a sweet send-up of small town America that comes across like an extended version of Second City Review or Saturday Night Live. Sure, some of the parody is pointed, but it's never mean-spirited. Blaine, Missouri, in the heart of the state, is having its 150th anniversary, and by golly the town's theatrical types are going to do it up right. Never mind that the talent is spread pretty thin from the stage struck town dentist (Eugene Levy), to travel agents (Fred Willard & Catherine O'Hara), to Dairy Queen princess (Parker Posey). Or that their inspiration comes from an off- off-off Broadway impresario (Christopher Guest), "temporarily on leave" from the Big Apple. He may not be your typical macho mid-western type, but he did serve on a destroyer and does have a wife, somewhere, so he says. It's all handled with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek, as we watch the cast lumber, stagger, and flounce through their dance routines and dream of Real stage success. Naturally, we expect the final result, the pageant performance before the whole town, to nose-dive., But it doesn't. Instead, the stage performance comes across rather sweetly, with just the right amount of unpolished success that brings the whole town to its feet in a boffo finale. What happens then is comical and not too surprising, considering all the low rent motels surrounding Hollywood. Levy, Willard, and the others are uniformly excellent as would be expected of veteran sketch artists. I don't know who to thank for the movie that had no obvious future, commercial or otherwise. But for darn sure this little sleeper goes into my tape library for repeated viewing.

    Waiting for Guffman is a mockumentary about a small town putting on a production in hopes of making it to Broadway. This new acting trope is led by rather eccentric Corky St. Clair(Christopher Guest), and consists of two travel agents(who have never left town), A Dairy Queen employee, a rather geeky dentist with a lazy eye, and so much more. The movie follows these cast of players with the support of the town, as they put on a production called, "Red, White, and Blaine"(Blaine being the town they live in). What is best about this movie is that the only scripted scenes were that of the actual play. Everything else is completely ad-libbed which makes this movie genuine and just downright funny. Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, in my opinion, are purely brilliant. The plot works, the characters are so offbeat and hysterical that I can still recall almost every single line they said. All in all, Waiting for Guffman is perhaps one of, if not the, funniest movie I have ever seen. 9/10.

    It's all there. The ridiculous characters who live a ridiculous delusion centered around a particular niche of people. The dry, awkward, intentional but not portrayed to be that way humor. It's classic Christopher Guest mockumentary and it's exactly what "Waiting for Guffman" is. The only thing is that Guest never goes the extra step to make these characters anything more than hysterical and it's there for the taking. "Guffman" centers around a fictional Missouri town called Blaine in which a local theater director Corky St. Clair (Guest) has agreed to create and direct a show about the history of the town for its 150th anniversary celebration. The film goes through the whole process by interviewing everyone involved and following St. Clair as it all happens. When they hear that a Broadway scout of sorts named Mort Guffman is to attend their performance, they all get incredibly excited. Guest and his usual cast of actors playing yet another set of actors are great once again in this film. Eugene Levy is great as the town's dentist who discovers his theatrical side when he's cast in the show. Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara continue to apply their off-beat senses of humor to their roles as a husband and wife that run a travel agency despite never having left Blaine in their lives. Parker Posey also demonstrates a great subtle humor to her part as a young Dairy Queen employee. The greatest statement that Guest makes with this film is that it's completely absurd that these people expect their lives to become anything more than dull. You follow them and they're so passionate about it despite clearly having no talent. But at the same time, Guest never really explores that. He just shows you the process of putting on the show in this film and relies on humor to carry you through it. With such great actors and characters like in all his films, it shocks me to see it all get wasted or at the least never fully developed. We never get to see these characters for who they really are despite the fact that we enjoy laughing at them.

    Classic Christopher Guest directing, excellent improv acting, hilarious songs during the play in the movie, and a great start to a line of movies that Guest directed in this way. Notable scenes: Eugene Levy's impression of Johnny Carson's impression of an Indian, Catherine O'Hara's bangs (straight up!), the first of Fred Willard's impressions of how TV personalities talk (which he later reprised in "A Mighty Wind"), Parker Posey's character talking ad nauseum about Dairy Queen creations, and Eugene Levy's martian song at the play. Too many parts to mention here, you'll just have to see for yourself. It should be noted that the Family Guy character of Bruce sounds exactly like Guest's Corky St. Clair. This is one of the better Guest movies to watch, so I don't think you'll be disappointed.

    A small town in Missouri is celebrating the 150 years of its existence, and the people gather together to make a remarkable musical play telling the story of the city celebrating its great historical moments. In the hands of writer and director Christopher Guest it is a strange comedy with very traces of originality, after all he goes back to the recurring documentary style filmmaking with all the main characters getting interviewed, and the whole thing takes too long to become a enjoyable film. Christopher Guest plays the director of the play; Eugene Levy plays a dentist with notable singing skills; Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara play a couple who is going to be part of this show, along with Parker Posey, Matt Keeslar, Bob Balaban and others. The movie begins with the selection of the participants and countless interviews with the people involved in this play. Then it evolves to the first rehearsals and the first problems involving budget, and a actor who couldn't perform on the day of the presentation. Along with it we know this eccentric town and its peculiar habitants telling stories about the city and their lives. The biggest happening for these people with this play is that a guy named Guffman will come to watch it and this guy happens to be very famous for producing plays on Braodway. So everybody wants to make their best and perform the best show ever made. Guest is known for a strange and sophisticated sense for comedy, and sometimes it's a good thing when everybody really knows what's happening in all the scenes. In the case of "Waiting for Guffman" the comedy took too long to be funny and the interviews once the greatest thing created by Guest in "This is Spinal Tap" was boring and unfunny. The scenes where the characters had dialog with each other worked way better, but some things could have been used more, explored more, developed to be funnier as it were e.g. the scene at the dinner where Fred Willard's character says that he made "a penis reduction" because the thing was too big. The joke went so fast that I was expecting more of it and then nothing. But I must say that this film didn't disappoint me in the so awaited play. It was the best thing in the whole film, it wasn't a disaster as it might seem predicted (after all it's a show of amateurs). It was interesting, creative and very amusing. The casting was great (both in the play and in the movie). It is one of those films that in the beginning doesn't offer much but you must not give up, just keep watching and you'll be glad for it. Among the funniest parts my favorite is near the final credits when Guest character shows lots of toys based on films (a lunch box of the film "The Remains of the Day", Andrew McCarthy and Anthony Michael Hall little statues, and the tiny toys recreating a scene of "My Dinner With Andre"). Nice film. 6/10

    I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. This has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended. Must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch it. The concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on American Idol. You watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. So how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an American Idol tryout? It would be pointless as this movie was. The use of improv is over-rated. We've all been in that setting where a group of friends get on a roll and everyone is cracking up with tears in the their eyes. I feel that is improv. Improv can't be turned on just because the camera is rolling as this film proves. If you like that Drew Carey hosted show of improv, you'll probably like this film. Overall the jokes were poor, the improv was sophomoric, and the over-acting by Guest and company was campy...and those are my compliments of this drivel. If a guy playing a trumpet AND the kettle drum at the same time is funny to you, fine. For me, I prefer more heady stuff like "I Love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw". But remember, I think SNL lost its humor in the 1980's, so maybe you'll like this G-rated humor. I kept waiting for a person to identify himself as the zoo keeper and then tell us there was no zoo in town. That's the humor you can expect. My only wish was that I could give this a minus rating.

    This is a fairly enjoyable film, but honestly I don't think it's deserving of all the praise it gets. If I could sum it up in one word, it would be 'mild.' The story is mildly interesting, and it follows a group of small-town folks who are mildly quirky, putting on a play that is pretty bad, but only mildly funny. Part of the problem, I think, is that it's somewhat one-joke-- the characters are stupid, and they're putting on a bad play. Beyond that, there's not much to laugh at. There are a few moments of comedy, but most of it is just repeating the same ideas which aren't original or funny in the first place-- Fred Willard's character is self-obsessed and obnoxious, Catherine O'Hara is blindly supportive of him, Corky St. Clair is flamboyantly gay, etc. It seems clich&eacute;'d to compare this (or any improvisational comedy) to Spinal Tap, but the key difference between them is that in Spinal Tap, the characters say funny things. In this, the fact that the characters are stupid/vain/whatever is supposed to be the joke. And it gets old very quickly. Watching the film, it seems like the play is going to be a hilarious climax, but it's not nearly as bad as it could be. The songs themselves are pretty funny, because they're so cheesy and typical of amateur musical theater, but being subjected to 15+ minutes of the same joke -- these characters are bad actors and the lyrics are cheesy -- is tiresome. Also, I'm guessing the ending is supposed to be surprising, but it's telegraphed pretty clearly, and you can see it coming a mile away.

Among the funniest parts my favorite is near the final credits when Guest character shows lots of toys based on films (a lunch box of the film "The Remains of the Day", Andrew McCarthy and Anthony Michael Hall little statues, and the tiny toys recreating a scene of "My Dinner With Andre"). Nice film. 6/10

    I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. This has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended. Must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch it. The concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on American Idol. You watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. So how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an American Idol tryout? It would be pointless as this movie was. The use of improv is over-rated. We've all been in that setting where a group of friends get on a roll and everyone is cracking up with tears in the their eyes. I feel that is improv. Improv can't be turned on just because the camera is rolling as this film proves. If you like that Drew Carey hosted show of improv, you'll probably like this film. Overall the jokes were poor, the improv was sophomoric, and the over-acting by Guest and company was campy...and those are my compliments of this drivel. If a guy playing a trumpet AND the kettle drum at the same time is funny to you, fine. For me, I prefer more heady stuff like "I Love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw". But remember, I think SNL lost its humor in the 1980's, so maybe you'll like this G-rated humor. I kept waiting for a person to identify himself as the zoo keeper and then tell us there was no zoo in town. That's the humor you can expect. My only wish was that I could give this a minus rating.

    This is a fairly enjoyable film, but honestly I don't think it's deserving of all the praise it gets. If I could sum it up in one word, it would be 'mild.' The story is mildly interesting, and it follows a group of small-town folks who are mildly quirky, putting on a play that is pretty bad, but only mildly funny. Part of the problem, I think, is that it's somewhat one-joke-- the characters are stupid, and they're putting on a bad play. Beyond that, there's not much to laugh at. There are a few moments of comedy, but most of it is just repeating the same ideas which aren't original or funny in the first place-- Fred Willard's character is self-obsessed and obnoxious, Catherine O'Hara is blindly supportive of him, Corky St. Clair is flamboyantly gay, etc. It seems clich&eacute;'d to compare this (or any improvisational comedy) to Spinal Tap, but the key difference between them is that in Spinal Tap, the characters say funny things. In this, the fact that the characters are stupid/vain/whatever is supposed to be the joke. And it gets old very quickly. Watching the film, it seems like the play is going to be a hilarious climax, but it's not nearly as bad as it could be. The songs themselves are pretty funny, because they're so cheesy and typical of amateur musical theater, but being subjected to 15+ minutes of the same joke -- these characters are bad actors and the lyrics are cheesy -- is tiresome. Also, I'm guessing the ending is supposed to be surprising, but it's telegraphed pretty clearly, and you can see it coming a mile away.

    Writer-director Christopher Guest's timing and peculiar sense of humor are purposefully erratic--and it takes some time for him to get an audience off the dime and into the perplexing spirit of his cinematic occasions. Guest is well-attuned to the colorful eccentricities of 'ordinary' folks, yet his knowing nature borders on smirking, and I'm not a big fan of obnoxiousness--no matter how talented the participants. Mockumentary about a small town acting troupe putting on a musical production does benefit from some great players (particularly Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, and the effortlessly funny Catherine O'Hara). However Guest, himself a co-star--giving a rather offensive performance as gay theater director Corky--does not have the pizazz to bring off scenes of uncomfortable ineptitude. One waits in queasy vain for a pay-off that never comes. I assume Guest wants to have some comedic punch within these improvisational set-ups; if so, he's punching with two limp wrists, and his film is awfully long even at 84 minutes. *1/2 from ****

    "Waiting for Guffman" (1996): THE FINEST assemblage of straight-faced comedians in all of history, create one of THE funniest movies EVER. "Waiting for Guffman" is about humans with more than enough faith...AND self-delusions. Christopher Guest is the driving force, both in front of and behind the camera, and along with Eugene Levy, portray a small town's population creating a small play about their small history, which is a VERY BIG deal to them. Guest's consistent theme (throughout his films) is about humans who don't have enough insight or talent to spot the lack of it within themselves. There is an incredible blind faith, tenderness and embarrassing, misguided drive within these people. And yet, within their little world, they support the dreams for one another, and move through their lives with solid delusion. "This is Spinal Tap", "Best in Show", and "A Mighty Wind" are other great examples. Guest also has the sense to call back his actors for further projects. This is brilliant work.

    This is the first of several films that Christopher Guest and his friends have made using a very unusual style. Instead of a clearly defined script, some very talented actors (such as Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard and others) took a script idea and improvised throughout. The film was then created using the best bits and I can honestly say that there is nothing like this film. While some of the jokes are very, very dry and occasionally fall flat, there is a subtle charm and wit to the film as you follow a group of 3rd rate local actors who have insane visions of Broadway. The film is ostensibly about a very local stage production about the founding of some small town. While these sort of pageants have been ubiquitous in small town America, this one is unique because supposedly a guy by the name of Guffman is coming to town and plans two see it. Guffman, it seems, is from Broadway and the cast has the temerity to believe that maybe they'll impress him so much that they'll become major stars. Considering the quality of the acting is well below that of an average high school production, this is very absurd. Yet, although ridiculous, there is a certain something in many of these people that is very likable so there is some depth to the film--you aren't just laughing at yokels who have ridiculous aspirations. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and think that people who like their humor subtle and perhaps a bit painful will enjoy this film. People who prefer broad comedy probably won't enjoy this very much.

    Thanks be to cable for reviving this very non-commercial film. It's a sweet send-up of small town America that comes across like an extended version of Second City Review or Saturday Night Live. Sure, some of the parody is pointed, but it's never mean-spirited. Blaine, Missouri, in the heart of the state, is having its 150th anniversary, and by golly the town's theatrical types are going to do it up right. Never mind that the talent is spread pretty thin from the stage struck town dentist (Eugene Levy), to travel agents (Fred Willard & Catherine O'Hara), to Dairy Queen princess (Parker Posey). Or that their inspiration comes from an off- off-off Broadway impresario (Christopher Guest), "temporarily on leave" from the Big Apple. He may not be your typical macho mid-western type, but he did serve on a destroyer and does have a wife, somewhere, so he says. It's all handled with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek, as we watch the cast lumber, stagger, and flounce through their dance routines and dream of Real stage success. Naturally, we expect the final result, the pageant performance before the whole town, to nose-dive., But it doesn't. Instead, the stage performance comes across rather sweetly, with just the right amount of unpolished success that brings the whole town to its feet in a boffo finale. What happens then is comical and not too surprising, considering all the low rent motels surrounding Hollywood. Levy, Willard, and the others are uniformly excellent as would be expected of veteran sketch artists. I don't know who to thank for the movie that had no obvious future, commercial or otherwise. But for darn sure this little sleeper goes into my tape library for repeated viewing.

    Waiting for Guffman is a mockumentary about a small town putting on a production in hopes of making it to Broadway. This new acting trope is led by rather eccentric Corky St. Clair(Christopher Guest), and consists of two travel agents(who have never left town), A Dairy Queen employee, a rather geeky dentist with a lazy eye, and so much more. The movie follows these cast of players with the support of the town, as they put on a production called, "Red, White, and Blaine"(Blaine being the town they live in). What is best about this movie is that the only scripted scenes were that of the actual play. Everything else is completely ad-libbed which makes this movie genuine and just downright funny. Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, in my opinion, are purely brilliant. The plot works, the characters are so offbeat and hysterical that I can still recall almost every single line they said. All in all, Waiting for Guffman is perhaps one of, if not the, funniest movie I have ever seen. 9/10.

    It's all there. The ridiculous characters who live a ridiculous delusion centered around a particular niche of people. The dry, awkward, intentional but not portrayed to be that way humor. It's classic Christopher Guest mockumentary and it's exactly what "Waiting for Guffman" is. The only thing is that Guest never goes the extra step to make these characters anything more than hysterical and it's there for the taking. "Guffman" centers around a fictional Missouri town called Blaine in which a local theater director Corky St. Clair (Guest) has agreed to create and direct a show about the history of the town for its 150th anniversary celebration. The film goes through the whole process by interviewing everyone involved and following St. Clair as it all happens. When they hear that a Broadway scout of sorts named Mort Guffman is to attend their performance, they all get incredibly excited. Guest and his usual cast of actors playing yet another set of actors are great once again in this film. Eugene Levy is great as the town's dentist who discovers his theatrical side when he's cast in the show. Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara continue to apply their off-beat senses of humor to their roles as a husband and wife that run a travel agency despite never having left Blaine in their lives. Parker Posey also demonstrates a great subtle humor to her part as a young Dairy Queen employee. The greatest statement that Guest makes with this film is that it's completely absurd that these people expect their lives to become anything more than dull. You follow them and they're so passionate about it despite clearly having no talent. But at the same time, Guest never really explores that. He just shows you the process of putting on the show in this film and relies on humor to carry you through it. With such great actors and characters like in all his films, it shocks me to see it all get wasted or at the least never fully developed. We never get to see these characters for who they really are despite the fact that we enjoy laughing at them.

    Classic Christopher Guest directing, excellent improv acting, hilarious songs during the play in the movie, and a great start to a line of movies that Guest directed in this way. Notable scenes: Eugene Levy's impression of Johnny Carson's impression of an Indian, Catherine O'Hara's bangs (straight up!), the first of Fred Willard's impressions of how TV personalities talk (which he later reprised in "A Mighty Wind"), Parker Posey's character talking ad nauseum about Dairy Queen creations, and Eugene Levy's martian song at the play. Too many parts to mention here, you'll just have to see for yourself. It should be noted that the Family Guy character of Bruce sounds exactly like Guest's Corky St. Clair. This is one of the better Guest movies to watch, so I don't think you'll be disappointed.

    A small town in Missouri is celebrating the 150 years of its existence, and the people gather together to make a remarkable musical play telling the story of the city celebrating its great historical moments. In the hands of writer and director Christopher Guest it is a strange comedy with very traces of originality, after all he goes back to the recurring documentary style filmmaking with all the main characters getting interviewed, and the whole thing takes too long to become a enjoyable film. Christopher Guest plays the director of the play; Eugene Levy plays a dentist with notable singing skills; Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara play a couple who is going to be part of this show, along with Parker Posey, Matt Keeslar, Bob Balaban and others. The movie begins with the selection of the participants and countless interviews with the people involved in this play. Then it evolves to the first rehearsals and the first problems involving budget, and a actor who couldn't perform on the day of the presentation. Along with it we know this eccentric town and its peculiar habitants telling stories about the city and their lives. The biggest happening for these people with this play is that a guy named Guffman will come to watch it and this guy happens to be very famous for producing plays on Braodway. So everybody wants to make their best and perform the best show ever made. Guest is known for a strange and sophisticated sense for comedy, and sometimes it's a good thing when everybody really knows what's happening in all the scenes. In the case of "Waiting for Guffman" the comedy took too long to be funny and the interviews once the greatest thing created by Guest in "This is Spinal Tap" was boring and unfunny. The scenes where the characters had dialog with each other worked way better, but some things could have been used more, explored more, developed to be funnier as it were e.g. the scene at the dinner where Fred Willard's character says that he made "a penis reduction" because the thing was too big. The joke went so fast that I was expecting more of it and then nothing. But I must say that this film didn't disappoint me in the so awaited play. It was the best thing in the whole film, it wasn't a disaster as it might seem predicted (after all it's a show of amateurs). It was interesting, creative and very amusing. The casting was great (both in the play and in the movie). It is one of those films that in the beginning doesn't offer much but you must not give up, just keep watching and you'll be glad for it. Among the funniest parts my favorite is near the final credits when Guest character shows lots of toys based on films (a lunch box of the film "The Remains of the Day", Andrew McCarthy and Anthony Michael Hall little statues, and the tiny toys recreating a scene of "My Dinner With Andre"). Nice film. 6/10

You follow them and they're so passionate about it despite clearly having no talent. But at the same time, Guest never really explores that. He just shows you the process of putting on the show in this film and relies on humor to carry you through it. With such great actors and characters like in all his films, it shocks me to see it all get wasted or at the least never fully developed. We never get to see these characters for who they really are despite the fact that we enjoy laughing at them.

    Classic Christopher Guest directing, excellent improv acting, hilarious songs during the play in the movie, and a great start to a line of movies that Guest directed in this way. Notable scenes: Eugene Levy's impression of Johnny Carson's impression of an Indian, Catherine O'Hara's bangs (straight up!), the first of Fred Willard's impressions of how TV personalities talk (which he later reprised in "A Mighty Wind"), Parker Posey's character talking ad nauseum about Dairy Queen creations, and Eugene Levy's martian song at the play. Too many parts to mention here, you'll just have to see for yourself. It should be noted that the Family Guy character of Bruce sounds exactly like Guest's Corky St. Clair. This is one of the better Guest movies to watch, so I don't think you'll be disappointed.

    A small town in Missouri is celebrating the 150 years of its existence, and the people gather together to make a remarkable musical play telling the story of the city celebrating its great historical moments. In the hands of writer and director Christopher Guest it is a strange comedy with very traces of originality, after all he goes back to the recurring documentary style filmmaking with all the main characters getting interviewed, and the whole thing takes too long to become a enjoyable film. Christopher Guest plays the director of the play; Eugene Levy plays a dentist with notable singing skills; Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara play a couple who is going to be part of this show, along with Parker Posey, Matt Keeslar, Bob Balaban and others. The movie begins with the selection of the participants and countless interviews with the people involved in this play. Then it evolves to the first rehearsals and the first problems involving budget, and a actor who couldn't perform on the day of the presentation. Along with it we know this eccentric town and its peculiar habitants telling stories about the city and their lives. The biggest happening for these people with this play is that a guy named Guffman will come to watch it and this guy happens to be very famous for producing plays on Braodway. So everybody wants to make their best and perform the best show ever made. Guest is known for a strange and sophisticated sense for comedy, and sometimes it's a good thing when everybody really knows what's happening in all the scenes. In the case of "Waiting for Guffman" the comedy took too long to be funny and the interviews once the greatest thing created by Guest in "This is Spinal Tap" was boring and unfunny. The scenes where the characters had dialog with each other worked way better, but some things could have been used more, explored more, developed to be funnier as it were e.g. the scene at the dinner where Fred Willard's character says that he made "a penis reduction" because the thing was too big. The joke went so fast that I was expecting more of it and then nothing. But I must say that this film didn't disappoint me in the so awaited play. It was the best thing in the whole film, it wasn't a disaster as it might seem predicted (after all it's a show of amateurs). It was interesting, creative and very amusing. The casting was great (both in the play and in the movie). It is one of those films that in the beginning doesn't offer much but you must not give up, just keep watching and you'll be glad for it. Among the funniest parts my favorite is near the final credits when Guest character shows lots of toys based on films (a lunch box of the film "The Remains of the Day", Andrew McCarthy and Anthony Michael Hall little statues, and the tiny toys recreating a scene of "My Dinner With Andre"). Nice film. 6/10

    I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. This has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended. Must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch it. The concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on American Idol. You watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. So how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an American Idol tryout? It would be pointless as this movie was. The use of improv is over-rated. We've all been in that setting where a group of friends get on a roll and everyone is cracking up with tears in the their eyes. I feel that is improv. Improv can't be turned on just because the camera is rolling as this film proves. If you like that Drew Carey hosted show of improv, you'll probably like this film. Overall the jokes were poor, the improv was sophomoric, and the over-acting by Guest and company was campy...and those are my compliments of this drivel. If a guy playing a trumpet AND the kettle drum at the same time is funny to you, fine. For me, I prefer more heady stuff like "I Love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw". But remember, I think SNL lost its humor in the 1980's, so maybe you'll like this G-rated humor. I kept waiting for a person to identify himself as the zoo keeper and then tell us there was no zoo in town. That's the humor you can expect. My only wish was that I could give this a minus rating.

    This is a fairly enjoyable film, but honestly I don't think it's deserving of all the praise it gets. If I could sum it up in one word, it would be 'mild.' The story is mildly interesting, and it follows a group of small-town folks who are mildly quirky, putting on a play that is pretty bad, but only mildly funny. Part of the problem, I think, is that it's somewhat one-joke-- the characters are stupid, and they're putting on a bad play. Beyond that, there's not much to laugh at. There are a few moments of comedy, but most of it is just repeating the same ideas which aren't original or funny in the first place-- Fred Willard's character is self-obsessed and obnoxious, Catherine O'Hara is blindly supportive of him, Corky St. Clair is flamboyantly gay, etc. It seems clich&eacute;'d to compare this (or any improvisational comedy) to Spinal Tap, but the key difference between them is that in Spinal Tap, the characters say funny things. In this, the fact that the characters are stupid/vain/whatever is supposed to be the joke. And it gets old very quickly. Watching the film, it seems like the play is going to be a hilarious climax, but it's not nearly as bad as it could be. The songs themselves are pretty funny, because they're so cheesy and typical of amateur musical theater, but being subjected to 15+ minutes of the same joke -- these characters are bad actors and the lyrics are cheesy -- is tiresome. Also, I'm guessing the ending is supposed to be surprising, but it's telegraphed pretty clearly, and you can see it coming a mile away.

    Writer-director Christopher Guest's timing and peculiar sense of humor are purposefully erratic--and it takes some time for him to get an audience off the dime and into the perplexing spirit of his cinematic occasions. Guest is well-attuned to the colorful eccentricities of 'ordinary' folks, yet his knowing nature borders on smirking, and I'm not a big fan of obnoxiousness--no matter how talented the participants. Mockumentary about a small town acting troupe putting on a musical production does benefit from some great players (particularly Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, and the effortlessly funny Catherine O'Hara). However Guest, himself a co-star--giving a rather offensive performance as gay theater director Corky--does not have the pizazz to bring off scenes of uncomfortable ineptitude. One waits in queasy vain for a pay-off that never comes. I assume Guest wants to have some comedic punch within these improvisational set-ups; if so, he's punching with two limp wrists, and his film is awfully long even at 84 minutes. *1/2 from ****

    "Waiting for Guffman" (1996): THE FINEST assemblage of straight-faced comedians in all of history, create one of THE funniest movies EVER. "Waiting for Guffman" is about humans with more than enough faith...AND self-delusions. Christopher Guest is the driving force, both in front of and behind the camera, and along with Eugene Levy, portray a small town's population creating a small play about their small history, which is a VERY BIG deal to them. Guest's consistent theme (throughout his films) is about humans who don't have enough insight or talent to spot the lack of it within themselves. There is an incredible blind faith, tenderness and embarrassing, misguided drive within these people. And yet, within their little world, they support the dreams for one another, and move through their lives with solid delusion. "This is Spinal Tap", "Best in Show", and "A Mighty Wind" are other great examples. Guest also has the sense to call back his actors for further projects. This is brilliant work.

    This is the first of several films that Christopher Guest and his friends have made using a very unusual style. Instead of a clearly defined script, some very talented actors (such as Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard and others) took a script idea and improvised throughout. The film was then created using the best bits and I can honestly say that there is nothing like this film. While some of the jokes are very, very dry and occasionally fall flat, there is a subtle charm and wit to the film as you follow a group of 3rd rate local actors who have insane visions of Broadway. The film is ostensibly about a very local stage production about the founding of some small town. While these sort of pageants have been ubiquitous in small town America, this one is unique because supposedly a guy by the name of Guffman is coming to town and plans two see it. Guffman, it seems, is from Broadway and the cast has the temerity to believe that maybe they'll impress him so much that they'll become major stars. Considering the quality of the acting is well below that of an average high school production, this is very absurd. Yet, although ridiculous, there is a certain something in many of these people that is very likable so there is some depth to the film--you aren't just laughing at yokels who have ridiculous aspirations. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and think that people who like their humor subtle and perhaps a bit painful will enjoy this film. People who prefer broad comedy probably won't enjoy this very much.

    Thanks be to cable for reviving this very non-commercial film. It's a sweet send-up of small town America that comes across like an extended version of Second City Review or Saturday Night Live. Sure, some of the parody is pointed, but it's never mean-spirited. Blaine, Missouri, in the heart of the state, is having its 150th anniversary, and by golly the town's theatrical types are going to do it up right. Never mind that the talent is spread pretty thin from the stage struck town dentist (Eugene Levy), to travel agents (Fred Willard & Catherine O'Hara), to Dairy Queen princess (Parker Posey). Or that their inspiration comes from an off- off-off Broadway impresario (Christopher Guest), "temporarily on leave" from the Big Apple. He may not be your typical macho mid-western type, but he did serve on a destroyer and does have a wife, somewhere, so he says. It's all handled with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek, as we watch the cast lumber, stagger, and flounce through their dance routines and dream of Real stage success. Naturally, we expect the final result, the pageant performance before the whole town, to nose-dive., But it doesn't. Instead, the stage performance comes across rather sweetly, with just the right amount of unpolished success that brings the whole town to its feet in a boffo finale. What happens then is comical and not too surprising, considering all the low rent motels surrounding Hollywood. Levy, Willard, and the others are uniformly excellent as would be expected of veteran sketch artists. I don't know who to thank for the movie that had no obvious future, commercial or otherwise. But for darn sure this little sleeper goes into my tape library for repeated viewing.

    Waiting for Guffman is a mockumentary about a small town putting on a production in hopes of making it to Broadway. This new acting trope is led by rather eccentric Corky St. Clair(Christopher Guest), and consists of two travel agents(who have never left town), A Dairy Queen employee, a rather geeky dentist with a lazy eye, and so much more. The movie follows these cast of players with the support of the town, as they put on a production called, "Red, White, and Blaine"(Blaine being the town they live in). What is best about this movie is that the only scripted scenes were that of the actual play. Everything else is completely ad-libbed which makes this movie genuine and just downright funny. Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, in my opinion, are purely brilliant. The plot works, the characters are so offbeat and hysterical that I can still recall almost every single line they said. All in all, Waiting for Guffman is perhaps one of, if not the, funniest movie I have ever seen. 9/10.

    It's all there. The ridiculous characters who live a ridiculous delusion centered around a particular niche of people. The dry, awkward, intentional but not portrayed to be that way humor. It's classic Christopher Guest mockumentary and it's exactly what "Waiting for Guffman" is. The only thing is that Guest never goes the extra step to make these characters anything more than hysterical and it's there for the taking. "Guffman" centers around a fictional Missouri town called Blaine in which a local theater director Corky St. Clair (Guest) has agreed to create and direct a show about the history of the town for its 150th anniversary celebration. The film goes through the whole process by interviewing everyone involved and following St. Clair as it all happens. When they hear that a Broadway scout of sorts named Mort Guffman is to attend their performance, they all get incredibly excited. Guest and his usual cast of actors playing yet another set of actors are great once again in this film. Eugene Levy is great as the town's dentist who discovers his theatrical side when he's cast in the show. Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara continue to apply their off-beat senses of humor to their roles as a husband and wife that run a travel agency despite never having left Blaine in their lives. Parker Posey also demonstrates a great subtle humor to her part as a young Dairy Queen employee. The greatest statement that Guest makes with this film is that it's completely absurd that these people expect their lives to become anything more than dull. You follow them and they're so passionate about it despite clearly having no talent. But at the same time, Guest never really explores that. He just shows you the process of putting on the show in this film and relies on humor to carry you through it. With such great actors and characters like in all his films, it shocks me to see it all get wasted or at the least never fully developed. We never get to see these characters for who they really are despite the fact that we enjoy laughing at them.

Or that their inspiration comes from an off- off-off Broadway impresario (Christopher Guest), "temporarily on leave" from the Big Apple. He may not be your typical macho mid-western type, but he did serve on a destroyer and does have a wife, somewhere, so he says. It's all handled with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek, as we watch the cast lumber, stagger, and flounce through their dance routines and dream of Real stage success. Naturally, we expect the final result, the pageant performance before the whole town, to nose-dive., But it doesn't. Instead, the stage performance comes across rather sweetly, with just the right amount of unpolished success that brings the whole town to its feet in a boffo finale. What happens then is comical and not too surprising, considering all the low rent motels surrounding Hollywood. Levy, Willard, and the others are uniformly excellent as would be expected of veteran sketch artists. I don't know who to thank for the movie that had no obvious future, commercial or otherwise. But for darn sure this little sleeper goes into my tape library for repeated viewing.

    Waiting for Guffman is a mockumentary about a small town putting on a production in hopes of making it to Broadway. This new acting trope is led by rather eccentric Corky St. Clair(Christopher Guest), and consists of two travel agents(who have never left town), A Dairy Queen employee, a rather geeky dentist with a lazy eye, and so much more. The movie follows these cast of players with the support of the town, as they put on a production called, "Red, White, and Blaine"(Blaine being the town they live in). What is best about this movie is that the only scripted scenes were that of the actual play. Everything else is completely ad-libbed which makes this movie genuine and just downright funny. Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, in my opinion, are purely brilliant. The plot works, the characters are so offbeat and hysterical that I can still recall almost every single line they said. All in all, Waiting for Guffman is perhaps one of, if not the, funniest movie I have ever seen. 9/10.

    It's all there. The ridiculous characters who live a ridiculous delusion centered around a particular niche of people. The dry, awkward, intentional but not portrayed to be that way humor. It's classic Christopher Guest mockumentary and it's exactly what "Waiting for Guffman" is. The only thing is that Guest never goes the extra step to make these characters anything more than hysterical and it's there for the taking. "Guffman" centers around a fictional Missouri town called Blaine in which a local theater director Corky St. Clair (Guest) has agreed to create and direct a show about the history of the town for its 150th anniversary celebration. The film goes through the whole process by interviewing everyone involved and following St. Clair as it all happens. When they hear that a Broadway scout of sorts named Mort Guffman is to attend their performance, they all get incredibly excited. Guest and his usual cast of actors playing yet another set of actors are great once again in this film. Eugene Levy is great as the town's dentist who discovers his theatrical side when he's cast in the show. Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara continue to apply their off-beat senses of humor to their roles as a husband and wife that run a travel agency despite never having left Blaine in their lives. Parker Posey also demonstrates a great subtle humor to her part as a young Dairy Queen employee. The greatest statement that Guest makes with this film is that it's completely absurd that these people expect their lives to become anything more than dull. You follow them and they're so passionate about it despite clearly having no talent. But at the same time, Guest never really explores that. He just shows you the process of putting on the show in this film and relies on humor to carry you through it. With such great actors and characters like in all his films, it shocks me to see it all get wasted or at the least never fully developed. We never get to see these characters for who they really are despite the fact that we enjoy laughing at them.

    Classic Christopher Guest directing, excellent improv acting, hilarious songs during the play in the movie, and a great start to a line of movies that Guest directed in this way. Notable scenes: Eugene Levy's impression of Johnny Carson's impression of an Indian, Catherine O'Hara's bangs (straight up!), the first of Fred Willard's impressions of how TV personalities talk (which he later reprised in "A Mighty Wind"), Parker Posey's character talking ad nauseum about Dairy Queen creations, and Eugene Levy's martian song at the play. Too many parts to mention here, you'll just have to see for yourself. It should be noted that the Family Guy character of Bruce sounds exactly like Guest's Corky St. Clair. This is one of the better Guest movies to watch, so I don't think you'll be disappointed.

    A small town in Missouri is celebrating the 150 years of its existence, and the people gather together to make a remarkable musical play telling the story of the city celebrating its great historical moments. In the hands of writer and director Christopher Guest it is a strange comedy with very traces of originality, after all he goes back to the recurring documentary style filmmaking with all the main characters getting interviewed, and the whole thing takes too long to become a enjoyable film. Christopher Guest plays the director of the play; Eugene Levy plays a dentist with notable singing skills; Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara play a couple who is going to be part of this show, along with Parker Posey, Matt Keeslar, Bob Balaban and others. The movie begins with the selection of the participants and countless interviews with the people involved in this play. Then it evolves to the first rehearsals and the first problems involving budget, and a actor who couldn't perform on the day of the presentation. Along with it we know this eccentric town and its peculiar habitants telling stories about the city and their lives. The biggest happening for these people with this play is that a guy named Guffman will come to watch it and this guy happens to be very famous for producing plays on Braodway. So everybody wants to make their best and perform the best show ever made. Guest is known for a strange and sophisticated sense for comedy, and sometimes it's a good thing when everybody really knows what's happening in all the scenes. In the case of "Waiting for Guffman" the comedy took too long to be funny and the interviews once the greatest thing created by Guest in "This is Spinal Tap" was boring and unfunny. The scenes where the characters had dialog with each other worked way better, but some things could have been used more, explored more, developed to be funnier as it were e.g. the scene at the dinner where Fred Willard's character says that he made "a penis reduction" because the thing was too big. The joke went so fast that I was expecting more of it and then nothing. But I must say that this film didn't disappoint me in the so awaited play. It was the best thing in the whole film, it wasn't a disaster as it might seem predicted (after all it's a show of amateurs). It was interesting, creative and very amusing. The casting was great (both in the play and in the movie). It is one of those films that in the beginning doesn't offer much but you must not give up, just keep watching and you'll be glad for it. Among the funniest parts my favorite is near the final credits when Guest character shows lots of toys based on films (a lunch box of the film "The Remains of the Day", Andrew McCarthy and Anthony Michael Hall little statues, and the tiny toys recreating a scene of "My Dinner With Andre"). Nice film. 6/10

    I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. This has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended. Must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch it. The concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on American Idol. You watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. So how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an American Idol tryout? It would be pointless as this movie was. The use of improv is over-rated. We've all been in that setting where a group of friends get on a roll and everyone is cracking up with tears in the their eyes. I feel that is improv. Improv can't be turned on just because the camera is rolling as this film proves. If you like that Drew Carey hosted show of improv, you'll probably like this film. Overall the jokes were poor, the improv was sophomoric, and the over-acting by Guest and company was campy...and those are my compliments of this drivel. If a guy playing a trumpet AND the kettle drum at the same time is funny to you, fine. For me, I prefer more heady stuff like "I Love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw". But remember, I think SNL lost its humor in the 1980's, so maybe you'll like this G-rated humor. I kept waiting for a person to identify himself as the zoo keeper and then tell us there was no zoo in town. That's the humor you can expect. My only wish was that I could give this a minus rating.

    This is a fairly enjoyable film, but honestly I don't think it's deserving of all the praise it gets. If I could sum it up in one word, it would be 'mild.' The story is mildly interesting, and it follows a group of small-town folks who are mildly quirky, putting on a play that is pretty bad, but only mildly funny. Part of the problem, I think, is that it's somewhat one-joke-- the characters are stupid, and they're putting on a bad play. Beyond that, there's not much to laugh at. There are a few moments of comedy, but most of it is just repeating the same ideas which aren't original or funny in the first place-- Fred Willard's character is self-obsessed and obnoxious, Catherine O'Hara is blindly supportive of him, Corky St. Clair is flamboyantly gay, etc. It seems clich&eacute;'d to compare this (or any improvisational comedy) to Spinal Tap, but the key difference between them is that in Spinal Tap, the characters say funny things. In this, the fact that the characters are stupid/vain/whatever is supposed to be the joke. And it gets old very quickly. Watching the film, it seems like the play is going to be a hilarious climax, but it's not nearly as bad as it could be. The songs themselves are pretty funny, because they're so cheesy and typical of amateur musical theater, but being subjected to 15+ minutes of the same joke -- these characters are bad actors and the lyrics are cheesy -- is tiresome. Also, I'm guessing the ending is supposed to be surprising, but it's telegraphed pretty clearly, and you can see it coming a mile away.

    Writer-director Christopher Guest's timing and peculiar sense of humor are purposefully erratic--and it takes some time for him to get an audience off the dime and into the perplexing spirit of his cinematic occasions. Guest is well-attuned to the colorful eccentricities of 'ordinary' folks, yet his knowing nature borders on smirking, and I'm not a big fan of obnoxiousness--no matter how talented the participants. Mockumentary about a small town acting troupe putting on a musical production does benefit from some great players (particularly Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, and the effortlessly funny Catherine O'Hara). However Guest, himself a co-star--giving a rather offensive performance as gay theater director Corky--does not have the pizazz to bring off scenes of uncomfortable ineptitude. One waits in queasy vain for a pay-off that never comes. I assume Guest wants to have some comedic punch within these improvisational set-ups; if so, he's punching with two limp wrists, and his film is awfully long even at 84 minutes. *1/2 from ****

    "Waiting for Guffman" (1996): THE FINEST assemblage of straight-faced comedians in all of history, create one of THE funniest movies EVER. "Waiting for Guffman" is about humans with more than enough faith...AND self-delusions. Christopher Guest is the driving force, both in front of and behind the camera, and along with Eugene Levy, portray a small town's population creating a small play about their small history, which is a VERY BIG deal to them. Guest's consistent theme (throughout his films) is about humans who don't have enough insight or talent to spot the lack of it within themselves. There is an incredible blind faith, tenderness and embarrassing, misguided drive within these people. And yet, within their little world, they support the dreams for one another, and move through their lives with solid delusion. "This is Spinal Tap", "Best in Show", and "A Mighty Wind" are other great examples. Guest also has the sense to call back his actors for further projects. This is brilliant work.

    This is the first of several films that Christopher Guest and his friends have made using a very unusual style. Instead of a clearly defined script, some very talented actors (such as Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard and others) took a script idea and improvised throughout. The film was then created using the best bits and I can honestly say that there is nothing like this film. While some of the jokes are very, very dry and occasionally fall flat, there is a subtle charm and wit to the film as you follow a group of 3rd rate local actors who have insane visions of Broadway. The film is ostensibly about a very local stage production about the founding of some small town. While these sort of pageants have been ubiquitous in small town America, this one is unique because supposedly a guy by the name of Guffman is coming to town and plans two see it. Guffman, it seems, is from Broadway and the cast has the temerity to believe that maybe they'll impress him so much that they'll become major stars. Considering the quality of the acting is well below that of an average high school production, this is very absurd. Yet, although ridiculous, there is a certain something in many of these people that is very likable so there is some depth to the film--you aren't just laughing at yokels who have ridiculous aspirations. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and think that people who like their humor subtle and perhaps a bit painful will enjoy this film. People who prefer broad comedy probably won't enjoy this very much.

    Thanks be to cable for reviving this very non-commercial film. It's a sweet send-up of small town America that comes across like an extended version of Second City Review or Saturday Night Live. Sure, some of the parody is pointed, but it's never mean-spirited. Blaine, Missouri, in the heart of the state, is having its 150th anniversary, and by golly the town's theatrical types are going to do it up right. Never mind that the talent is spread pretty thin from the stage struck town dentist (Eugene Levy), to travel agents (Fred Willard & Catherine O'Hara), to Dairy Queen princess (Parker Posey). Or that their inspiration comes from an off- off-off Broadway impresario (Christopher Guest), "temporarily on leave" from the Big Apple. He may not be your typical macho mid-western type, but he did serve on a destroyer and does have a wife, somewhere, so he says. It's all handled with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek, as we watch the cast lumber, stagger, and flounce through their dance routines and dream of Real stage success.

What happens then is comical and not too surprising, considering all the low rent motels surrounding Hollywood. Levy, Willard, and the others are uniformly excellent as would be expected of veteran sketch artists. I don't know who to thank for the movie that had no obvious future, commercial or otherwise.
