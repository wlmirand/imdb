    I saw this film more than 20 years ago, and never could get it out of my imagination--it is one of the best films I have ever seen. One detail that might be lost is how beautifully Mozart's fantasy opera "The Magic Flute" is interwoven into the plot. The boy's mother attends a performance of this opera, with fateful consequences. One of the fantastic conceits of the plot is that the boy is guided at crucial moments in his quest by the trio of boy sopranos that guides Tamino in his quest in "The Magic Flute", and just as the hero of Mozart's masterpiece eventually learns the identity of his father, this same quest is at the heart of this nearly perfect little movie.

    Beautiful story of a young boy's search for his "father" after his mother is accidently killed. His search takes him on several adventures leading him closer and closer to his goal. The boy, David Vermes, looking for all the world like a pre-adolescent Marlon Brando,gives a lovely performance -understated and moving. The fantasy elements were delightful and I found myself smiling with joy at the end of the film. You will too!
