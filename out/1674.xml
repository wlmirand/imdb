    I think that, along with "Accattone" and "The Gospel According to St. Matthew", "Mamma Roma" is one of the best films directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini, being one of his most moving works. The way in which this film portrays a hard and dramatic reality is remarkable in every possible way, making the story and the characters from the movie something very close to the viewer, having at the same a very poetical quality in each scene. I think that is shame that Pasolini is mostly remembered by the dull "Trilogy of Life" movies and "Sal&ograve;, or the 120 Days of Sodom, 1975)" when he made such memorable and beautiful films like this one. "Mamma Roma" is a heartbreaking (but also very inspiring and wonderfully made) film which I recommend to any viewer.

    "You'll be his first kiss his first love his first friend You are his momma And he is your whole world" I have selected this mother-son verse for my review because it seems to accurately correspond to this movie's core idea. As one of the first features by Italy's controversial yet versatile talent, Pier Paolo Pasolini, MAMMA ROMA is a movie which remains strongly in the memory of the viewer due to, as a New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther pointed out, its "bottomless well of emotions," its sensuality and "dark iconoclasm." Nothing is black and white, everything is highly complex, more to say: CONTRADICTORY. Having so many ideas blended, mixed, out of place, the film is an altogether shocking experience. While Pasolini's other films may occur too bizarre and "feverish" (Crowther) for some viewers, this one is actually a striking combination of the director's perversion and genius. As much as MAMMA ROMA may be considered a descendant of Italian Neorealism being an almost 'successor' or 'sequence' to Rossellini's ROMA CITTA APERTA (additionally, the presence of Lamberto Maggiorani echoes DeSica's masterpiece BICYCLE THIEVES uttering his only word in the movie - "al ladro"), it is an unpredictable, surprising mixture of the classic and the modern, the Greek 'cosmos' vs. 'chaos' and a board for Renaissance painting, baroque music, classical literature, mystical Catholicism and Freudian psychoanalysis. Something that perhaps only Pasolini was able to do without the finale of 'scandalous rage' and oblivion.' In the title itself, the city of Rome (the locale of the story), different from its ancient power and arrogance, from its medieval capital of pilgrim destination, from its 1945 crisis, the Rome of 1962 is, satirically, personified by a prostitute (almost on the verge of blasphemy with an association with Salus Populi Romani - Madonna in Santa Maria Maggiore called by some 'Mamma di Roma'). But she is not Fellini's Cabiria (though there are certain parallels, particularly in the desire of change), but far more: a mother, title Mamma Roma played brilliantly by Anna Magnani. Although much could be said about this blended aspect of literary/artistic/musical/religious sources (all of which Pasolini himself personified) - the aspect that is nicely developed by Jim's FilmWebsite (where he discusses Vivaldi concerto in the scenes of emotional tension along with Leonardo da Vinci frescoes of "madly inappropriate Biblical references" - referring to Crowther's words), for that reason, another review would be necessary. In the context of art, the director of photography, Tonino Delli Colli deserves full credit making some scenes look almost magically meaningful. But, as this requires more in depth analysis, let me focus more on this title character or more, two characters that make the whole film an emotional and psychological feast. They foremost make the film worth seeing. ANNA MAGNANI: All tensions somehow meet their realization in the immensely meaningful yet complex persona of Mamma Roma. When she sings, she sings with joy, when she plays, she plays with passion, when she looks at us, her eyes tell everything. Although there were many roles in her life, this is actually the most appealing one. Initially not very enthusiastic about the role, the vibrant contrast and absorbing vitality results. I would agree with Jim's article that her performance is "earthy and passionate (...) simultaneously hilarious and tragic, realistic and stylized." Apart from the "enormous bags under her eyes," she plunges herself into the story as hardly anyone else as a mother and a prostitute. Who can forget her brilliant confessions to all people around in the nocturnal streets of Rome or her final tragedy. But we cannot analyze her alone. She is fully realized along with her son, Ettore, a boy bitten by the lizard of his mother's past and the lizard of money and destructive greed. ETTORE GAROFOLO embodies wandering youth, wandering puberty being constantly in search of something. With his fellows, he is like one of the Apostles from IL VANGELO SECONDO MATTEO; alone, he is Pasolini's world in itself. Inspired by Caravaggio's "Boy Bitten By a Lizard" he is both pure manifestation of Pasolini's view of a young man along with his immensely appraised maturing sexuality as well as a product of psychoanalytical aspects. In him, the struggle is the stimulus and response, the source and the goal, the mother as a haunting love, a haunting desire and a girl, Bruna, as freedom of escape. And yet, she is still a product of his mind and inner, almost subconscious sphere. Contrast evokes, the one of spirituality in the glimpse of Madonna and carnality in the glimpse of the girl's breasts; the contrast between fresh nature and old ruins - fresh air among the old heyday. He blends the carnal and the spiritual, the joys and suffering. In one of the most memorable scenes (with the superior camera-work when the boy remains within his own frame), he talks to his mother who sits like a harlot...later, he talks to Bruna, the Eve-like creature from the Garden of Eden. The much appreciated tango scene is a climax of the Oepidus complex. Mind you that in his final agony, which echoes another Neorealist masterpiece, PAISA, but, foremost, Andrea Mantegna's painting, Ettore addresses his mother, conclusively the one he has loved most. Solely in that relation, we can embrace Bosley Crowther's words that "the story imprisons its characters in a world of temptation." When Ettore dies, he resembles Christ by the echoing power of Mantegna's masterful painting. Here, the boy of one name becomes the implicit protagonist of the movie. Our attention is surely drawn to him. But also, something dies in Mamma Roma in her Pieta-like agony because she is his momma and he is her whole world. Strange and uncommon as this pious reference may seem, Pasolini makes this conclusion a universal appeal of feelings that more powerfully than radiantly speak of their universal religiosity and spirituality, but, above all, humanity.

    The echoes of Fellini's "Nights of Cabiria" and "La Dolce Vita" are obvious and Pasolini was a screenwriter on both of those projects. That said, this stands on its own as a deeply felt look at one part of Italian society, circa 1962. Watching it, I understood a mother's love for her son and the roots of present-day Italian society better than I had done. That's not a bad achievement! It's also a tremendously attractive time capsule, a window into that moment in time and place. As an aside, I wonder how this film would have been perceived had Pasolini not made "Salo". I think it might have been taken rather more seriously. Watch and make up your own minds.

    One of the main things I noticed about Pier Paolo Pasolini's 1962 film is how many similarities it has with Fellini's 'Nights of Cabiria', which was made five years earlier. Not least of all, the feisty Anna Magnani as the 40 something whore of the title, nick-named presumably after her reputation as the best working woman in the city. There's also the fact that she desperately wants to retire, set up a fruit and veg stall and finally, get to know her teenage son. Then, there's the modern, on 'the edge of town' high-rise flats and wasteland that borders flanks them. Many Italian directors of the day used such locations, presumably as they were easy to film on and probably didn't require the expense and red-tape of getting permission to film in the City centre. But, those landscapes show a universal sort of hinterland, between poverty and modernism and their ugly sparseness helps concentrate on the human figures we're watching. Giuletta Masina, as the protagonist Fellini's wife then, in comparison, also tries to retire but her romantic ideals go astray and she just heads for heartache, whilst Mamma Rosa wants to see the son that his father never saw and she feels guilty over her neglect of him and wants him to steer a course away from the way she has lived. Unfortunately, these ideals slip a little, her persistent pimp notwithstanding, as she relies more and more on using her rather dodgy contacts and past liaisons to achieve that. Sickly as a young child, Ettore (Ettore Garofolo) is, frankly not a handsome lad and when he gets to know a local girl who doesn't quite meet his mother's high ideals, she asks another much younger and prettier call-girl to introduce him to women for the first time, if you get my drift and of course she wants to get him a job....talk about a mother's love for a child being blind! Pasolini's approach is rather less dramatic and theatrical than Fellini's but is probably more consistent and it's more straightforward. You just have to love Mamma's offbeat approach to life, though not everybody does in the film, which is both amusing and entertaining. I understand that the cast were all amateur apart from Anna Magnani, as was common with films from the Italian neorealist movement and this makes it all the more natural and believable. I noticed that Pasolini employed some lovely steady camera shots, like with a Steadicam, slowly moving along streets, which gives a graceful fluidity, adding to an often poetic poise. However, the emotional buttons don't get pushed quite as hard or readily as with the Fellini comparison but it's still an enjoyable film, that certainly adds to the list of notable Italian films of the 50s and 60s. If you enjoy the straighter side of Fellini, such as La Dolce Vita, or any that depicts Rome in a contemporary way, then you'll enjoy this too. The 'Mr Bongo' release has a decent transfer with pretty good sound. A few subtitling spelling gremlins are just noticeable but never spoil the viewing pleasure.

    As my first Pasolini film, Mamma Roma is as good an introduction as I could have wished. The plot is terrific and heartbreaking, and the depth and range that Mamma Roma's character calls for is delivered in full by Magnani. One must only consider the two separate occasions we see Mamma walk the line after dark. What a force! Her figure attracts so many men, almost like a light in an otherwise dark night would attract insects. But none of these men can keep up with her--the past she recounts, although lightheartedly, is too troublesome a road for anyone to walk down. Indeed, she herself never finds an escape from it. And this is the genius of Pasolini's film. That we have the two figures of Ettore and Mamma Roma, who each emerge in the film at the hour of their seeming liberation-- Mamma freed from her pimp and Ettore from his "hicks" in the country--who nonetheless crumble under the weight of history. All they are left to do is wonder, to paraphrase Ettore during the end, "why so many people are torturing (them)," when all they (Mamma Roma and Ettore) want to do is good. Existential despair that resonates today amidst grave financial uncertainty and uncertain class ascendancy.

    It doesn't even have any machine guns in it. I like movies with machine guns, guns that go kaccka-kaccka-kaccka-pow! This pretentious, operatic Italian schlock makes me wish for a good, classy American film like Forrest Gump or The Shawshank Redemption or Braveheart. Roma is the virgin whore and Ettore is the eromenos Christ, that's all well and good, if you're a decadent gay like Pasolini was. On second thought, I love this movie, "Mamma mamma, I'm dying mama ... " It's transcendentally beautiful. You couldn't even make a movie like this today, it would burn up the screen, the movie theater complex, and consequently engulf the surrounding city and country side, and people would rather watch Jack Ass or The Shawshank Redemption besides. I take it to be emblematic of the decadence of our times that this didn't make IMDb's top 250.

    In Rome, middle-aged Anna Magnani (as Mamma Roma) tries to shed her past life as a prostitute and reconnect with rebellious teenage son Ettore Garofolo (as Ettore). He moves in as she gets a legitimate job. Things already show signs of falling apart when young ex-pimp Franco Citti (as Carmine) returns to town. After failing to make himself respectable, Mr. Citti demands Ms. Magnani return to the working the world's oldest profession. If not, he threatens tell son Garofolo about Magnani's sordid past... This neo-realistic drama loses some realism in the story. You have to wonder how Citti ("I was 23 and you were 40") hooked up with Magnani and why he doesn't look for more profitable whores, presently. Also, Garofolo (age 17&frac12;) certainly seems able to deduce his mother's past. Still, writer/director Pier Paolo Pasolini uses his landscape stylishly, with a lot of walking scenes. Christian religious allegory is prevalent (note Garofolo in bondage). A fly walks across the opening credits, which serves as a comment. ******** Mamma Roma (8/31/62) Pier Paolo Pasolini ~ Anna Magnani, Ettore Garofolo, Franco Citti, Silvana Corsini

    If Sarah Palin wants to support what she calls her "Mama Grizzlies," she should have Mamma Roma in her stable. This woman (Anna Magnani - The Rose Tattoo, The Secret of Santa Vittoria) is one tough grizzly, especially when it comes to her son, and trying to keep him on the straight and narrow. She used to be a woman of the evening, until her pimp (Franco Citti - Accattone!, Godfather III) marries a country girl and retires, letting her reclaim her now teenage son (Ettore Garofolo in his first film) and move to Rome. He soon falls for a loose woman and in with some unsavory characters. That's when the grizzly rears on her hind legs and goes to work. Director Pier Paolo Pasolini (The Gospel According to St. Matthew, The Decameron, and the last before he was murdered, Sal&ograve;) used Citti in many of his films. His films, while critically acclaimed, could draw moral outrage. Five minutes were cut from this film by the Italian authorities; although I can only guess where. He still was one of the best, and directed a winner here.

    I know that this is a very well respected film and there are a lot of people who loved it. However, as for me, it did little for me. Now I am NOT saying it's a bad film--I didn't particularly enjoy it. Much of this might just be because I have never understood the appeal for Anna Magnani. In the films of hers I have seen, she just seems very loud and coarse. To each his own. Mamma Roma (Magnani) is a middle-aged prostitute who has been scrimping and saving for years to afford to retire and bring her son (now 16) to come live with her. He'd apparently been raised for her by someone in the country. The problem is that despite her best intentions, it really is too late to make him into the gentleman she'd envisioned. He prefers to hang with low-lifes, steal and avoid work--proving the old saying "you can never go back". A very sad story, indeed. The best thing about the film is that it does NOT have clich&eacute;s like some films about prostitutes. There is no magical happy ending and the life is tough and sad. I can applaud Pasolini for this. But life is awfully short and sometimes I wonder if my time would be better spent watching something a bit more enjoyable. This ISN'T to say I only want to see happy films--it's just that with little connection to the characters, I just never felt particularly drawn to finish the film once it began--something that is actually pretty rare for a film nut like myself.

    An author and filmmaker, Pier Paolo Pasolini forged a body of work that painted a bleak, uncompromised portrait of the human condition. His breakthrough picture, Mamma Roma, exemplified his worldview. With Mamma Roma, the auteur's sophomore effort, Pasolini addressed the false promise of Roman life through a stark examination of a subproletariat family's breakdown. The film opens with a harsh metaphor for the principal's state, as the image of swine eating and rooting in pig manure widens out to reveal a wedding party. From frame one, we are immediately steeped in one of European cinema's truest and most unforgiving portraits of broken, hungry lives. As the opening scene unfolds, the titular character  played by Anna Magnani - feeds the hogs and harasses the bride and groom, her brash mouth braying a laugh that functions more as a psychological salve than a genuine response to the world around her. She taunts the bride, asserting that the pigs are speaking to her and one has confessed to being a whore. Here the director establishes a foreboding symbol so overt it becomes subtle, as Mamma Roma herself is revealed to be a lady of the evening in the sequence that follows. And when the groom (Mamma Roma's former husband), bride, and Mamma Roma herself improvise musical wedding toasts with lyrics that become progressively harsher and more revealing, a powerful yet oblique metaphor for the grandiloquence of peasant suffering takes form. Thus, Pasolini establishes early on that the film will inhabit the world of the "hick"  the milieu of the starving - and the concept of the peasant's ill-fated pursuit of edification grows organically out of these opening scenes. When the next sequence begins, Mamma Roma reconnects with an estranged teenage son. Here, Pasolini establishes a sublime, melancholy image of institutional social stagnation as we are introduced to young Ettore (Ettore Garofalo) riding a carousel. The mundane nature of the carnival ride subtly reflects all of the characters' lack of mobility  they will inevitably return to where they began. The circular nature of despair is further explored through Mamma Roma's sojourns to "the track", a row for ladies of the evening where she previously moonlighted as a prostitute. The sequence features our protagonist taking a circular route around the row, conversing with the brethren she's self deluded enough to feel are beneath her. Her journey mirrors her trajectory throughout the film; she begins the story a beleaguered whore and, in spite of the most fervent of efforts, concludes the same. Thus, Pasolini effectively illustrates a theme consistent in his work: the inevitability of failure. It is the titular character's hidden self that, once revealed, completes Ettore's disillusionment. When introduced, he is a young tough content to roam the back streets with his equally aimless friends. The search for a "score" (another bit of foreshadowing as a score is what eventually leads to his institutionalization) supplants any real material pursuit. Yet Mamma Roma's false promise of a better life serves more to suffocate the young man than embolden him. This dichotomy is established when young Ettore is first taken to his mother's apartment. A strong undercurrent of sexual tension permeates the tango scene  a sequence in which Mamma Roma and Ettore dance to the ironically titled Italian folk song "Gypsy Violin." Her coquettish wiles and close, effusive body language reveal the incestuous nature of her affection, as well as Ettore's understandable sense of emotional suffocation. The incest motif is further underscored when Ettore becomes infatuated with a fickle young mother. Mamma Roma seeks to diffuse his affection by having a colleague seduce and deflower him. Here, Mamma Roma's yearnings crystallize as she literally assigns a surrogate to copulate with the young "pimp." Pasolini's use of incest can be viewed as clever and uncompromised, as it is both a symbol of circular entrapment and a metaphor for the manner in which desolate generations subjugate each other in the service of their needs. In this respect, sexuality bares the same weight as economic or emotional factors. Thus, in Mamma Roma, all needs are satisfied within the perverse symbiosis of dysfunction. The story concludes as a fait e' compli. After Mamma Roma's previous husband reappears (a plot point that symbolically underscores the impossibility of self-gentrification; the man is, literally, the past come back for a reckoning), young Ettore discovers his mother's past and embarks on another score. The target, a hospital for the aged previously alluded to in the story, constitutes Pasolini's most apocalyptic metaphor. The cold, pale walls and rows of old men filed away until they die reflect the state of the indigent that populate the story. The patients exist as Ettore is destined to. At the denouement, the young man lays strapped to a wooden table, a literal manifestation of his psychosocial imprisonment. Hence, the director has created a portrait of an impoverished class trapped in behavior patterns that are incestuous and self-hypnotizing. Mamma Roma constitutes a hopeless vision of humanity unequaled in the Pasolini cannon until his final film.

When Ettore dies, he resembles Christ by the echoing power of Mantegna's masterful painting. Here, the boy of one name becomes the implicit protagonist of the movie. Our attention is surely drawn to him. But also, something dies in Mamma Roma in her Pieta-like agony because she is his momma and he is her whole world. Strange and uncommon as this pious reference may seem, Pasolini makes this conclusion a universal appeal of feelings that more powerfully than radiantly speak of their universal religiosity and spirituality, but, above all, humanity.

    The echoes of Fellini's "Nights of Cabiria" and "La Dolce Vita" are obvious and Pasolini was a screenwriter on both of those projects. That said, this stands on its own as a deeply felt look at one part of Italian society, circa 1962. Watching it, I understood a mother's love for her son and the roots of present-day Italian society better than I had done. That's not a bad achievement! It's also a tremendously attractive time capsule, a window into that moment in time and place. As an aside, I wonder how this film would have been perceived had Pasolini not made "Salo". I think it might have been taken rather more seriously. Watch and make up your own minds.

    One of the main things I noticed about Pier Paolo Pasolini's 1962 film is how many similarities it has with Fellini's 'Nights of Cabiria', which was made five years earlier. Not least of all, the feisty Anna Magnani as the 40 something whore of the title, nick-named presumably after her reputation as the best working woman in the city. There's also the fact that she desperately wants to retire, set up a fruit and veg stall and finally, get to know her teenage son. Then, there's the modern, on 'the edge of town' high-rise flats and wasteland that borders flanks them. Many Italian directors of the day used such locations, presumably as they were easy to film on and probably didn't require the expense and red-tape of getting permission to film in the City centre. But, those landscapes show a universal sort of hinterland, between poverty and modernism and their ugly sparseness helps concentrate on the human figures we're watching. Giuletta Masina, as the protagonist Fellini's wife then, in comparison, also tries to retire but her romantic ideals go astray and she just heads for heartache, whilst Mamma Rosa wants to see the son that his father never saw and she feels guilty over her neglect of him and wants him to steer a course away from the way she has lived. Unfortunately, these ideals slip a little, her persistent pimp notwithstanding, as she relies more and more on using her rather dodgy contacts and past liaisons to achieve that. Sickly as a young child, Ettore (Ettore Garofolo) is, frankly not a handsome lad and when he gets to know a local girl who doesn't quite meet his mother's high ideals, she asks another much younger and prettier call-girl to introduce him to women for the first time, if you get my drift and of course she wants to get him a job....talk about a mother's love for a child being blind! Pasolini's approach is rather less dramatic and theatrical than Fellini's but is probably more consistent and it's more straightforward. You just have to love Mamma's offbeat approach to life, though not everybody does in the film, which is both amusing and entertaining. I understand that the cast were all amateur apart from Anna Magnani, as was common with films from the Italian neorealist movement and this makes it all the more natural and believable. I noticed that Pasolini employed some lovely steady camera shots, like with a Steadicam, slowly moving along streets, which gives a graceful fluidity, adding to an often poetic poise. However, the emotional buttons don't get pushed quite as hard or readily as with the Fellini comparison but it's still an enjoyable film, that certainly adds to the list of notable Italian films of the 50s and 60s. If you enjoy the straighter side of Fellini, such as La Dolce Vita, or any that depicts Rome in a contemporary way, then you'll enjoy this too. The 'Mr Bongo' release has a decent transfer with pretty good sound. A few subtitling spelling gremlins are just noticeable but never spoil the viewing pleasure.

    As my first Pasolini film, Mamma Roma is as good an introduction as I could have wished. The plot is terrific and heartbreaking, and the depth and range that Mamma Roma's character calls for is delivered in full by Magnani. One must only consider the two separate occasions we see Mamma walk the line after dark. What a force! Her figure attracts so many men, almost like a light in an otherwise dark night would attract insects. But none of these men can keep up with her--the past she recounts, although lightheartedly, is too troublesome a road for anyone to walk down. Indeed, she herself never finds an escape from it. And this is the genius of Pasolini's film. That we have the two figures of Ettore and Mamma Roma, who each emerge in the film at the hour of their seeming liberation-- Mamma freed from her pimp and Ettore from his "hicks" in the country--who nonetheless crumble under the weight of history. All they are left to do is wonder, to paraphrase Ettore during the end, "why so many people are torturing (them)," when all they (Mamma Roma and Ettore) want to do is good. Existential despair that resonates today amidst grave financial uncertainty and uncertain class ascendancy.

    It doesn't even have any machine guns in it. I like movies with machine guns, guns that go kaccka-kaccka-kaccka-pow! This pretentious, operatic Italian schlock makes me wish for a good, classy American film like Forrest Gump or The Shawshank Redemption or Braveheart. Roma is the virgin whore and Ettore is the eromenos Christ, that's all well and good, if you're a decadent gay like Pasolini was. On second thought, I love this movie, "Mamma mamma, I'm dying mama ... " It's transcendentally beautiful. You couldn't even make a movie like this today, it would burn up the screen, the movie theater complex, and consequently engulf the surrounding city and country side, and people would rather watch Jack Ass or The Shawshank Redemption besides. I take it to be emblematic of the decadence of our times that this didn't make IMDb's top 250.

    In Rome, middle-aged Anna Magnani (as Mamma Roma) tries to shed her past life as a prostitute and reconnect with rebellious teenage son Ettore Garofolo (as Ettore). He moves in as she gets a legitimate job. Things already show signs of falling apart when young ex-pimp Franco Citti (as Carmine) returns to town. After failing to make himself respectable, Mr. Citti demands Ms. Magnani return to the working the world's oldest profession. If not, he threatens tell son Garofolo about Magnani's sordid past... This neo-realistic drama loses some realism in the story. You have to wonder how Citti ("I was 23 and you were 40") hooked up with Magnani and why he doesn't look for more profitable whores, presently. Also, Garofolo (age 17&frac12;) certainly seems able to deduce his mother's past. Still, writer/director Pier Paolo Pasolini uses his landscape stylishly, with a lot of walking scenes. Christian religious allegory is prevalent (note Garofolo in bondage). A fly walks across the opening credits, which serves as a comment. ******** Mamma Roma (8/31/62) Pier Paolo Pasolini ~ Anna Magnani, Ettore Garofolo, Franco Citti, Silvana Corsini

    If Sarah Palin wants to support what she calls her "Mama Grizzlies," she should have Mamma Roma in her stable. This woman (Anna Magnani - The Rose Tattoo, The Secret of Santa Vittoria) is one tough grizzly, especially when it comes to her son, and trying to keep him on the straight and narrow. She used to be a woman of the evening, until her pimp (Franco Citti - Accattone!, Godfather III) marries a country girl and retires, letting her reclaim her now teenage son (Ettore Garofolo in his first film) and move to Rome. He soon falls for a loose woman and in with some unsavory characters. That's when the grizzly rears on her hind legs and goes to work. Director Pier Paolo Pasolini (The Gospel According to St. Matthew, The Decameron, and the last before he was murdered, Sal&ograve;) used Citti in many of his films. His films, while critically acclaimed, could draw moral outrage. Five minutes were cut from this film by the Italian authorities; although I can only guess where. He still was one of the best, and directed a winner here.

    I know that this is a very well respected film and there are a lot of people who loved it. However, as for me, it did little for me. Now I am NOT saying it's a bad film--I didn't particularly enjoy it. Much of this might just be because I have never understood the appeal for Anna Magnani. In the films of hers I have seen, she just seems very loud and coarse. To each his own. Mamma Roma (Magnani) is a middle-aged prostitute who has been scrimping and saving for years to afford to retire and bring her son (now 16) to come live with her. He'd apparently been raised for her by someone in the country. The problem is that despite her best intentions, it really is too late to make him into the gentleman she'd envisioned. He prefers to hang with low-lifes, steal and avoid work--proving the old saying "you can never go back". A very sad story, indeed. The best thing about the film is that it does NOT have clich&eacute;s like some films about prostitutes. There is no magical happy ending and the life is tough and sad. I can applaud Pasolini for this. But life is awfully short and sometimes I wonder if my time would be better spent watching something a bit more enjoyable. This ISN'T to say I only want to see happy films--it's just that with little connection to the characters, I just never felt particularly drawn to finish the film once it began--something that is actually pretty rare for a film nut like myself.

    An author and filmmaker, Pier Paolo Pasolini forged a body of work that painted a bleak, uncompromised portrait of the human condition. His breakthrough picture, Mamma Roma, exemplified his worldview. With Mamma Roma, the auteur's sophomore effort, Pasolini addressed the false promise of Roman life through a stark examination of a subproletariat family's breakdown. The film opens with a harsh metaphor for the principal's state, as the image of swine eating and rooting in pig manure widens out to reveal a wedding party. From frame one, we are immediately steeped in one of European cinema's truest and most unforgiving portraits of broken, hungry lives. As the opening scene unfolds, the titular character  played by Anna Magnani - feeds the hogs and harasses the bride and groom, her brash mouth braying a laugh that functions more as a psychological salve than a genuine response to the world around her. She taunts the bride, asserting that the pigs are speaking to her and one has confessed to being a whore. Here the director establishes a foreboding symbol so overt it becomes subtle, as Mamma Roma herself is revealed to be a lady of the evening in the sequence that follows. And when the groom (Mamma Roma's former husband), bride, and Mamma Roma herself improvise musical wedding toasts with lyrics that become progressively harsher and more revealing, a powerful yet oblique metaphor for the grandiloquence of peasant suffering takes form. Thus, Pasolini establishes early on that the film will inhabit the world of the "hick"  the milieu of the starving - and the concept of the peasant's ill-fated pursuit of edification grows organically out of these opening scenes. When the next sequence begins, Mamma Roma reconnects with an estranged teenage son. Here, Pasolini establishes a sublime, melancholy image of institutional social stagnation as we are introduced to young Ettore (Ettore Garofalo) riding a carousel. The mundane nature of the carnival ride subtly reflects all of the characters' lack of mobility  they will inevitably return to where they began. The circular nature of despair is further explored through Mamma Roma's sojourns to "the track", a row for ladies of the evening where she previously moonlighted as a prostitute. The sequence features our protagonist taking a circular route around the row, conversing with the brethren she's self deluded enough to feel are beneath her. Her journey mirrors her trajectory throughout the film; she begins the story a beleaguered whore and, in spite of the most fervent of efforts, concludes the same. Thus, Pasolini effectively illustrates a theme consistent in his work: the inevitability of failure. It is the titular character's hidden self that, once revealed, completes Ettore's disillusionment. When introduced, he is a young tough content to roam the back streets with his equally aimless friends. The search for a "score" (another bit of foreshadowing as a score is what eventually leads to his institutionalization) supplants any real material pursuit. Yet Mamma Roma's false promise of a better life serves more to suffocate the young man than embolden him. This dichotomy is established when young Ettore is first taken to his mother's apartment. A strong undercurrent of sexual tension permeates the tango scene  a sequence in which Mamma Roma and Ettore dance to the ironically titled Italian folk song "Gypsy Violin." Her coquettish wiles and close, effusive body language reveal the incestuous nature of her affection, as well as Ettore's understandable sense of emotional suffocation. The incest motif is further underscored when Ettore becomes infatuated with a fickle young mother. Mamma Roma seeks to diffuse his affection by having a colleague seduce and deflower him. Here, Mamma Roma's yearnings crystallize as she literally assigns a surrogate to copulate with the young "pimp." Pasolini's use of incest can be viewed as clever and uncompromised, as it is both a symbol of circular entrapment and a metaphor for the manner in which desolate generations subjugate each other in the service of their needs. In this respect, sexuality bares the same weight as economic or emotional factors. Thus, in Mamma Roma, all needs are satisfied within the perverse symbiosis of dysfunction. The story concludes as a fait e' compli. After Mamma Roma's previous husband reappears (a plot point that symbolically underscores the impossibility of self-gentrification; the man is, literally, the past come back for a reckoning), young Ettore discovers his mother's past and embarks on another score. The target, a hospital for the aged previously alluded to in the story, constitutes Pasolini's most apocalyptic metaphor. The cold, pale walls and rows of old men filed away until they die reflect the state of the indigent that populate the story. The patients exist as Ettore is destined to. At the denouement, the young man lays strapped to a wooden table, a literal manifestation of his psychosocial imprisonment. Hence, the director has created a portrait of an impoverished class trapped in behavior patterns that are incestuous and self-hypnotizing. Mamma Roma constitutes a hopeless vision of humanity unequaled in the Pasolini cannon until his final film.

    I think that, along with "Accattone" and "The Gospel According to St. Matthew", "Mamma Roma" is one of the best films directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini, being one of his most moving works. The way in which this film portrays a hard and dramatic reality is remarkable in every possible way, making the story and the characters from the movie something very close to the viewer, having at the same a very poetical quality in each scene. I think that is shame that Pasolini is mostly remembered by the dull "Trilogy of Life" movies and "Sal&ograve;, or the 120 Days of Sodom, 1975)" when he made such memorable and beautiful films like this one. "Mamma Roma" is a heartbreaking (but also very inspiring and wonderfully made) film which I recommend to any viewer.

    "You'll be his first kiss his first love his first friend You are his momma And he is your whole world" I have selected this mother-son verse for my review because it seems to accurately correspond to this movie's core idea. As one of the first features by Italy's controversial yet versatile talent, Pier Paolo Pasolini, MAMMA ROMA is a movie which remains strongly in the memory of the viewer due to, as a New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther pointed out, its "bottomless well of emotions," its sensuality and "dark iconoclasm." Nothing is black and white, everything is highly complex, more to say: CONTRADICTORY. Having so many ideas blended, mixed, out of place, the film is an altogether shocking experience. While Pasolini's other films may occur too bizarre and "feverish" (Crowther) for some viewers, this one is actually a striking combination of the director's perversion and genius. As much as MAMMA ROMA may be considered a descendant of Italian Neorealism being an almost 'successor' or 'sequence' to Rossellini's ROMA CITTA APERTA (additionally, the presence of Lamberto Maggiorani echoes DeSica's masterpiece BICYCLE THIEVES uttering his only word in the movie - "al ladro"), it is an unpredictable, surprising mixture of the classic and the modern, the Greek 'cosmos' vs. 'chaos' and a board for Renaissance painting, baroque music, classical literature, mystical Catholicism and Freudian psychoanalysis. Something that perhaps only Pasolini was able to do without the finale of 'scandalous rage' and oblivion.' In the title itself, the city of Rome (the locale of the story), different from its ancient power and arrogance, from its medieval capital of pilgrim destination, from its 1945 crisis, the Rome of 1962 is, satirically, personified by a prostitute (almost on the verge of blasphemy with an association with Salus Populi Romani - Madonna in Santa Maria Maggiore called by some 'Mamma di Roma'). But she is not Fellini's Cabiria (though there are certain parallels, particularly in the desire of change), but far more: a mother, title Mamma Roma played brilliantly by Anna Magnani. Although much could be said about this blended aspect of literary/artistic/musical/religious sources (all of which Pasolini himself personified) - the aspect that is nicely developed by Jim's FilmWebsite (where he discusses Vivaldi concerto in the scenes of emotional tension along with Leonardo da Vinci frescoes of "madly inappropriate Biblical references" - referring to Crowther's words), for that reason, another review would be necessary. In the context of art, the director of photography, Tonino Delli Colli deserves full credit making some scenes look almost magically meaningful. But, as this requires more in depth analysis, let me focus more on this title character or more, two characters that make the whole film an emotional and psychological feast. They foremost make the film worth seeing. ANNA MAGNANI: All tensions somehow meet their realization in the immensely meaningful yet complex persona of Mamma Roma. When she sings, she sings with joy, when she plays, she plays with passion, when she looks at us, her eyes tell everything. Although there were many roles in her life, this is actually the most appealing one. Initially not very enthusiastic about the role, the vibrant contrast and absorbing vitality results. I would agree with Jim's article that her performance is "earthy and passionate (...) simultaneously hilarious and tragic, realistic and stylized." Apart from the "enormous bags under her eyes," she plunges herself into the story as hardly anyone else as a mother and a prostitute. Who can forget her brilliant confessions to all people around in the nocturnal streets of Rome or her final tragedy. But we cannot analyze her alone. She is fully realized along with her son, Ettore, a boy bitten by the lizard of his mother's past and the lizard of money and destructive greed. ETTORE GAROFOLO embodies wandering youth, wandering puberty being constantly in search of something. With his fellows, he is like one of the Apostles from IL VANGELO SECONDO MATTEO; alone, he is Pasolini's world in itself. Inspired by Caravaggio's "Boy Bitten By a Lizard" he is both pure manifestation of Pasolini's view of a young man along with his immensely appraised maturing sexuality as well as a product of psychoanalytical aspects. In him, the struggle is the stimulus and response, the source and the goal, the mother as a haunting love, a haunting desire and a girl, Bruna, as freedom of escape. And yet, she is still a product of his mind and inner, almost subconscious sphere. Contrast evokes, the one of spirituality in the glimpse of Madonna and carnality in the glimpse of the girl's breasts; the contrast between fresh nature and old ruins - fresh air among the old heyday. He blends the carnal and the spiritual, the joys and suffering. In one of the most memorable scenes (with the superior camera-work when the boy remains within his own frame), he talks to his mother who sits like a harlot...later, he talks to Bruna, the Eve-like creature from the Garden of Eden. The much appreciated tango scene is a climax of the Oepidus complex. Mind you that in his final agony, which echoes another Neorealist masterpiece, PAISA, but, foremost, Andrea Mantegna's painting, Ettore addresses his mother, conclusively the one he has loved most. Solely in that relation, we can embrace Bosley Crowther's words that "the story imprisons its characters in a world of temptation." When Ettore dies, he resembles Christ by the echoing power of Mantegna's masterful painting. Here, the boy of one name becomes the implicit protagonist of the movie. Our attention is surely drawn to him. But also, something dies in Mamma Roma in her Pieta-like agony because she is his momma and he is her whole world. Strange and uncommon as this pious reference may seem, Pasolini makes this conclusion a universal appeal of feelings that more powerfully than radiantly speak of their universal religiosity and spirituality, but, above all, humanity.

After failing to make himself respectable, Mr. Citti demands Ms. Magnani return to the working the world's oldest profession. If not, he threatens tell son Garofolo about Magnani's sordid past... This neo-realistic drama loses some realism in the story. You have to wonder how Citti ("I was 23 and you were 40") hooked up with Magnani and why he doesn't look for more profitable whores, presently. Also, Garofolo (age 17&frac12;) certainly seems able to deduce his mother's past. Still, writer/director Pier Paolo Pasolini uses his landscape stylishly, with a lot of walking scenes. Christian religious allegory is prevalent (note Garofolo in bondage). A fly walks across the opening credits, which serves as a comment. ******** Mamma Roma (8/31/62) Pier Paolo Pasolini ~ Anna Magnani, Ettore Garofolo, Franco Citti, Silvana Corsini

    If Sarah Palin wants to support what she calls her "Mama Grizzlies," she should have Mamma Roma in her stable. This woman (Anna Magnani - The Rose Tattoo, The Secret of Santa Vittoria) is one tough grizzly, especially when it comes to her son, and trying to keep him on the straight and narrow. She used to be a woman of the evening, until her pimp (Franco Citti - Accattone!, Godfather III) marries a country girl and retires, letting her reclaim her now teenage son (Ettore Garofolo in his first film) and move to Rome. He soon falls for a loose woman and in with some unsavory characters. That's when the grizzly rears on her hind legs and goes to work. Director Pier Paolo Pasolini (The Gospel According to St. Matthew, The Decameron, and the last before he was murdered, Sal&ograve;) used Citti in many of his films. His films, while critically acclaimed, could draw moral outrage. Five minutes were cut from this film by the Italian authorities; although I can only guess where. He still was one of the best, and directed a winner here.

    I know that this is a very well respected film and there are a lot of people who loved it. However, as for me, it did little for me. Now I am NOT saying it's a bad film--I didn't particularly enjoy it. Much of this might just be because I have never understood the appeal for Anna Magnani. In the films of hers I have seen, she just seems very loud and coarse. To each his own. Mamma Roma (Magnani) is a middle-aged prostitute who has been scrimping and saving for years to afford to retire and bring her son (now 16) to come live with her. He'd apparently been raised for her by someone in the country. The problem is that despite her best intentions, it really is too late to make him into the gentleman she'd envisioned. He prefers to hang with low-lifes, steal and avoid work--proving the old saying "you can never go back". A very sad story, indeed. The best thing about the film is that it does NOT have clich&eacute;s like some films about prostitutes. There is no magical happy ending and the life is tough and sad. I can applaud Pasolini for this. But life is awfully short and sometimes I wonder if my time would be better spent watching something a bit more enjoyable. This ISN'T to say I only want to see happy films--it's just that with little connection to the characters, I just never felt particularly drawn to finish the film once it began--something that is actually pretty rare for a film nut like myself.

    An author and filmmaker, Pier Paolo Pasolini forged a body of work that painted a bleak, uncompromised portrait of the human condition. His breakthrough picture, Mamma Roma, exemplified his worldview. With Mamma Roma, the auteur's sophomore effort, Pasolini addressed the false promise of Roman life through a stark examination of a subproletariat family's breakdown. The film opens with a harsh metaphor for the principal's state, as the image of swine eating and rooting in pig manure widens out to reveal a wedding party. From frame one, we are immediately steeped in one of European cinema's truest and most unforgiving portraits of broken, hungry lives. As the opening scene unfolds, the titular character  played by Anna Magnani - feeds the hogs and harasses the bride and groom, her brash mouth braying a laugh that functions more as a psychological salve than a genuine response to the world around her. She taunts the bride, asserting that the pigs are speaking to her and one has confessed to being a whore. Here the director establishes a foreboding symbol so overt it becomes subtle, as Mamma Roma herself is revealed to be a lady of the evening in the sequence that follows. And when the groom (Mamma Roma's former husband), bride, and Mamma Roma herself improvise musical wedding toasts with lyrics that become progressively harsher and more revealing, a powerful yet oblique metaphor for the grandiloquence of peasant suffering takes form. Thus, Pasolini establishes early on that the film will inhabit the world of the "hick"  the milieu of the starving - and the concept of the peasant's ill-fated pursuit of edification grows organically out of these opening scenes. When the next sequence begins, Mamma Roma reconnects with an estranged teenage son. Here, Pasolini establishes a sublime, melancholy image of institutional social stagnation as we are introduced to young Ettore (Ettore Garofalo) riding a carousel. The mundane nature of the carnival ride subtly reflects all of the characters' lack of mobility  they will inevitably return to where they began. The circular nature of despair is further explored through Mamma Roma's sojourns to "the track", a row for ladies of the evening where she previously moonlighted as a prostitute. The sequence features our protagonist taking a circular route around the row, conversing with the brethren she's self deluded enough to feel are beneath her. Her journey mirrors her trajectory throughout the film; she begins the story a beleaguered whore and, in spite of the most fervent of efforts, concludes the same. Thus, Pasolini effectively illustrates a theme consistent in his work: the inevitability of failure. It is the titular character's hidden self that, once revealed, completes Ettore's disillusionment. When introduced, he is a young tough content to roam the back streets with his equally aimless friends. The search for a "score" (another bit of foreshadowing as a score is what eventually leads to his institutionalization) supplants any real material pursuit. Yet Mamma Roma's false promise of a better life serves more to suffocate the young man than embolden him. This dichotomy is established when young Ettore is first taken to his mother's apartment. A strong undercurrent of sexual tension permeates the tango scene  a sequence in which Mamma Roma and Ettore dance to the ironically titled Italian folk song "Gypsy Violin." Her coquettish wiles and close, effusive body language reveal the incestuous nature of her affection, as well as Ettore's understandable sense of emotional suffocation. The incest motif is further underscored when Ettore becomes infatuated with a fickle young mother. Mamma Roma seeks to diffuse his affection by having a colleague seduce and deflower him. Here, Mamma Roma's yearnings crystallize as she literally assigns a surrogate to copulate with the young "pimp." Pasolini's use of incest can be viewed as clever and uncompromised, as it is both a symbol of circular entrapment and a metaphor for the manner in which desolate generations subjugate each other in the service of their needs. In this respect, sexuality bares the same weight as economic or emotional factors. Thus, in Mamma Roma, all needs are satisfied within the perverse symbiosis of dysfunction. The story concludes as a fait e' compli. After Mamma Roma's previous husband reappears (a plot point that symbolically underscores the impossibility of self-gentrification; the man is, literally, the past come back for a reckoning), young Ettore discovers his mother's past and embarks on another score. The target, a hospital for the aged previously alluded to in the story, constitutes Pasolini's most apocalyptic metaphor. The cold, pale walls and rows of old men filed away until they die reflect the state of the indigent that populate the story. The patients exist as Ettore is destined to. At the denouement, the young man lays strapped to a wooden table, a literal manifestation of his psychosocial imprisonment. Hence, the director has created a portrait of an impoverished class trapped in behavior patterns that are incestuous and self-hypnotizing. Mamma Roma constitutes a hopeless vision of humanity unequaled in the Pasolini cannon until his final film.
