    ...this film receives a TEN. No other movie captures the fire of the Panther better than that of Mario van Peeble's production. However, just as well for entertainment purposes, some facts were tampered and skewed to fit into the film. This isn't a documentary, folks. Nor is it a bio about Huey P. This is a historically correct film based on a NOVEL. If that doesn't tell you enough about what you're in for, I don't know what will. Historical fiction is what this is. If you're looking for a interesting, socially conscious film that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is it. If not - you may as well keep moving, jack.

    You cannot deny the timeless performance done by our actors to portray the Black Panthers at their finest. The long lost quotations said by Martin and Malcolm buried in the sands of time has left our next generation watered down of its glory and deprived of our will to uplift our people. By revisiting the mentality of the Black Panthers, we are able to learn from the past and reiterate the fact that that there is always room for improving oneself as well as the community. Today's rap scene of glorifying gangs and portraying crime and violence has no place in society and leads to more people getting killed. We must show this movie to our teens so that they understand they come from a bloodline of proud individuals who want the next generation to carry on their legacy.

    Black Panthers never caught on in Britain but I remember some very large black blokes with black T shirts and necklaces made with rifle bullets larging it at a Stones concert in Hyde Park although they were rather upstaged by the Hell's Angels sitting round in large groups biting the heads off chickens.Ah,happy days - unless you happened to be a Rhode Island Red. Possibly because British blacks weren't brought over here by the millions in chains and worked to death in cotton fields they tend to be less militaristic.I would imagine that sort of treatment might cause any minority to look somewhat askance at their former oppressors. Hence "Panther" (1995-Mario van Peebles)a fictionalised account of the founding of a group of Freedom Fighters or Urban Terrorists depending on whether you're in the ghetto looking out or out of the ghetto looking in. So many myths have sprung up in the last forty years that it's virtually impossible to sort out the truth from the propaganda.Certainly many Panthers had had difficult lives,some were criminals happy to hide their criminality under the respectable cloak of "revolution",but many genuinely saw themselves as victims of an unjust social order. Unfortunately much of the sense of history being made that must have suffused the original members of the organisation has been marginalised by Mr van Peebles hysterical polemic.Its simplistic "Two legs bad,four legs good" stance is such that a more sensitive white person than myself might consider it almost racist.As well-balanced as a one-legged man in an arse-kicking contest,the movie clearly believes it is preaching to the converted.Instead,unforgivably,it comes across as almost a parody of the "blaxploitation" era. Mr van Peebles may well be an angry man,but in over-egging his pudding with "Panther",he has done neither himself nor his subject any favours.

    This movie came and went during its run in theaters due to its nature. But I feel that it was an honest attempt to tell the story of the most controversial party in America: the Black Panthers. The story is based on the Panthers and how they came to be. The party gets frustrated with the police brutality in America and decide to defend themselves with weaponry. The acting is pretty good all around: Marcus Chong is great as Huey P Newton, Judge is Kadeem Hardison's best performance on screen point blank period. The same goes for Bokeem Woodbine's character in this movie. The only flaw is that they leave out a few key elements that lead to their downfall but other than that I have no real gripe with this film. I thought that Mario Van Peebles did the best he could with the material he was given but we have to understand that movies are edited just like books are edited so certain information that might have made a difference in the story are left out causing some scenes in the movie to be a little vague. You can always read about the Black Panthers if you want to know more about them. This movie is worthy of being in your collection despite the little flaws. If you can find it at a reasonable price, you can definitely check it out.

    Panther (1995) is not to meant to be a dead on account of the Black Panther Party. This is what they call historical fiction. That is when you make up a story involving real life characters. The book this movie was based upon was writing a few years back by Melvin Van Peebles. The story is nothing more that a fictional account dealing with real life people. It's a movie. Not a documentary. So please keep this in mind when watching it. But the dramatic elements and acting were quite good. I enjoyed it as a drama. If you want to learn about the Black Panther Party this is a good launching pad. From here I suggest you go to your local library and study up on these revolutionaries who tried to make some decent changes to the poor communities but were sabotaged by the F.B.I. and their army of rats and snitches. I thought it was a bold step for Mr. Van Peebles to try and make a mainstream movie about a group of local heroes who have been buried by the mainstream and the far right. Stars Kadeem Hardison, Bokeem Woodbine, Joe Don Baker, Courtney B. Vance, Chris Rock, Bobby Brown and Angela Bassett. Directed by Mario Van Peebles. Co written by Mario and Melvin Van Peebles. Recommended.

    How interesting it is that some of the supporting comments regarding the politics of this movie come from Ireland and England. The comment regarding Patty Hearst, especially intriguing. The error by the poster gives you an idea of how flawed people's perceptions of the Panthers were and still are. Hearst was kidnapped by Sinque, who was purported to be an ex-Panther member. The Panthers were an interesting phenomena borne from the rough streets of Oakland,California, my hometown. They brought ideals of self-awareness, pride and self-defense. Some say that the theory of J.Edgar Hoover dumping drugs into the black neighborhoods to bring about its downfall was preposterous. As a resident of Oakland, it was absolutely factual that drugs were put into the community to destabilize it. COINTELPRO had insurrectionists cast into the Black Panthers as well as Campus student movements. The FBI sought the downfall of Martin Luther King, and celebrated on the day of his assassination. Not all parties were in cahoots, but he was thought of as a communist agitator. Funny how no major motion picture of him was done following JFK, isn't it? Some aspects were quite fictitious, the "Judge" character and the shootout in the warehouse as well. The Panthers were considered an enemy to the established order and it was seeded with "inside" people to ferment internal conflict. The film may not be completely historically accurate, but it does portray the need then and now for a Black Panther Movement. The concept of Government conspiracy isn't new; see Operation Mongoose, Operation Northwoods, Watergate, Iran-Contra, etc. this was a flawed, but intriguing film about an organization that sought to improve the conditions of the community. And how the establishment created methods to destabilize and destroy it.

    1960's inner city America. Tired of non-effective prayer meetings, vigils and pleas to God, a group within the black community decide to take more direct action. Taking the principles of Malcolm X, the group study their rights and begin to bear arms and take a stand against the inequality and the brutality towards their community. The subject is worthy of a film and is an interesting piece of civil rights history but this film is not the one to do it. The blame for much of this much sadly rest with Peebles in his role as director. If Spike Lee and Denzel Washington could be seen as the black A-list, then Peebles must be very much a C-list star, and his films are often worthy of B or C grades. This is the problem here, the film is not great as a film. It is told in a simplistic, fist raising way that takes away from the impact of it as reality. The focus on Judge's involvement rather than the story of the movement itself, turning the film into more of a action film than one of historical interest. This is a shame as, even embellished with pro-black slant, the subject would have been interesting. As it is, the fact about whether this was true or not didn't matter to me because I didn't get the impression of history, I got told a story of a man who tries to act as a mole for the group, while some militant group spreads throughout the country. It's a real shame - cause that's not the story I was hoping to be told. If Peebles is a C-list member, then the rest of the cast comes across like very much a second rate version of Malcolm X. Hardison is a poor comic, never mind requiring him to do a dramatic role. Chong is OK as Huey but he isn't really well served by a film that doesn't pull back well enough and see what the panthers grow to become (and the `finally' bit at the end doesn't cut it). Generally the cast feel like they wouldn't be out of place in a TVM and their performances mostly reflect that. Again, it is a shame but it's hard not to blame the material for their inability to rise above it. Overall this film was a major letdown for me. I was expecting or hoping for a film that had some historical context and would have the force and impact of Malcolm X. Sadly I was expecting too much from it and this would have been better enjoyed as a thriller that happens to be set in the middle of a Panther cell rather than anything else.

    Panther's depictions of the Black Panther Party for Self Defense and the opposing white establishment are perhaps a bit simplistic; nevertheless it made the movie no less thrilling. Mario Van Peebles uses television footage from the civil rights struggles in the 1960s to demonstrate why the Black Panther Party came into existence. The scenes of police brutality and the Party standing up to the police were shot well and enable the viewer to grasp the fear as well as frustration of the times. Whether or not the film portrays an accurate account of history and the reasoning behind the creation of the Party is debatable. Of course, no film is completely historically accurate, and most producers, writers and directors have their own agenda when making a film. However, all that being said, it is not difficult to believe that the 'white' establishment behaved either exactly or near to the way it is depicted in the film. We need only read our history books, newspapers and watch footage (some of which was shown in the film) of the 'white' establishment's appalling actions during that period and indeed for centuries before that to determine that the depictions of overt racism and inhumane treatment dished out by the police and others in the film were not far fetched. One other fact to consider is that the Panthers were considered an enemy to the established order and therefore the propaganda surrounding the history of the Party depicts them as worse than they actually were. The film, I believe, breaks those negative images down. It goes beyond the headlines of the time and depicts the problems facing black Americans then and indeed to some extent now. Indeed the most impressive aspect of the film is how it portrayed the need for the Black Panther Movement. One finds it difficult to advocate violence; however when one's life is on the line and those who are meant to protect are the perpetrators, then the right to defend oneself is the right of every person. The most powerful message this film sends is that the Panther Party was the result of a need not simply a desire. The film may not be 'completely historically accurate;' however it does present a different view of the Panther Party and its objectives, one that is long overdue. This film is a must see!

    I`d never heard of the movie PANTHER until it was shown on Channel 4 tonight. I was under the impression that this was going to be a true story about the rise of the Black Panther movement but right from the opening titles the doubt was sown in my mind as the words " Screenplay by Melvin Van Pebbles based on his novel " appeared . Eh ? Novel ? By definition novels are works of fiction so if the screenplay is based on a novel that means it`s not a true story Something else I noticed in the credits were some bizarre casting choices with well regarded actors like Joe Don Baker and Angela Bassett appearing alongside non actors like Chris Rock and Bobby Brown and as can be expected the performances are very hit and miss . In fact the casting matches Mario Van Pebbles directing perfectly since one moment it feels like a farcical comedy and the next moment a polemical diatribe on race and a moment later a docu-drama . I doubt if this was Van Pebbles intention , but I will give him credit since he probably upset everyone regardless of race by painting nearly every single white person as being racist while nearly every black person is an anchronistic home boy from the 1990s . Just as well no-one thinks this is a true story . Or do they ?

    Watching this movie had me on the verge of laughter and on the verge of anger. The laughter came from watching such poor acting and such a truly inane script. It is so funny to see the "totally good" Black Panthers and the "totally bad" white people do battle. Of course, the Panthers say things like "golly gee" and "nedo." It is funny. HOWEVER, it is also borderline revolting. Not to judge the Panthers, but they were a little more hardcore than this silly movie portrays them to be. They were much more militant and not quite the "goody goodies" Mr. Peebles so naively wants us to believe. It is actually somewhat insulting. This movie has the historical accuracy of a.....well, I am trying to think of something as inaccurate and can't do it.

One finds it difficult to advocate violence; however when one's life is on the line and those who are meant to protect are the perpetrators, then the right to defend oneself is the right of every person. The most powerful message this film sends is that the Panther Party was the result of a need not simply a desire. The film may not be 'completely historically accurate;' however it does present a different view of the Panther Party and its objectives, one that is long overdue. This film is a must see!

    I`d never heard of the movie PANTHER until it was shown on Channel 4 tonight. I was under the impression that this was going to be a true story about the rise of the Black Panther movement but right from the opening titles the doubt was sown in my mind as the words " Screenplay by Melvin Van Pebbles based on his novel " appeared . Eh ? Novel ? By definition novels are works of fiction so if the screenplay is based on a novel that means it`s not a true story Something else I noticed in the credits were some bizarre casting choices with well regarded actors like Joe Don Baker and Angela Bassett appearing alongside non actors like Chris Rock and Bobby Brown and as can be expected the performances are very hit and miss . In fact the casting matches Mario Van Pebbles directing perfectly since one moment it feels like a farcical comedy and the next moment a polemical diatribe on race and a moment later a docu-drama . I doubt if this was Van Pebbles intention , but I will give him credit since he probably upset everyone regardless of race by painting nearly every single white person as being racist while nearly every black person is an anchronistic home boy from the 1990s . Just as well no-one thinks this is a true story . Or do they ?

    Watching this movie had me on the verge of laughter and on the verge of anger. The laughter came from watching such poor acting and such a truly inane script. It is so funny to see the "totally good" Black Panthers and the "totally bad" white people do battle. Of course, the Panthers say things like "golly gee" and "nedo." It is funny. HOWEVER, it is also borderline revolting. Not to judge the Panthers, but they were a little more hardcore than this silly movie portrays them to be. They were much more militant and not quite the "goody goodies" Mr. Peebles so naively wants us to believe. It is actually somewhat insulting. This movie has the historical accuracy of a.....well, I am trying to think of something as inaccurate and can't do it.
