This mutant breed was engineered to die after one generation, but three years later Susan finds out that the species has survived and evolved into large monsters that can mimic human form...... After watching his movie, you will understand why Del Toro disowned it. The film has flashes of his brilliance, and at times, a wonderful creation is dying to get out, but then the Weinstein sheen takes over, and ruins the unique factor the movie had. No all Weinstein films have that sheen though, but you find more of their trademark 'editing' in smaller films like this, especially prolific directors who want to bring their genius to Hollywood. So what you are left with is a generic B-movie, with a beautiful Oscar winner in it, The Bad Guy from The Net, Diane Lanes Ex, and the brilliant Charles S. Dutton. The cast sounds good, but the material is dire. For the rest of the movie, we have kids selling bugs, the worst subways in the world, and a strange figure that spends half the film staring at people, and the other half attacking them, all in a really dark movie. The cast are better than this, and if Sorvino made better choices in 1997 rather than this and Romy and Michelle, she would be huge today. Shame really.

    Academy Award winners Mira Sorvino & F. Murray Abraham star in this thriller about an entomologist(Sorvino) who creates a mutant breed of insect to infect another breed of cockroaches that have been spreading a highly contagious disease decimating the children population. The disease is stopped, but three years later, a new problem emerges when that mutant breed(engineered to die off quickly) instead survive and thrive as large insects who can mimic human beings, and who must kill... There was much potential here for a compelling and exciting story, but somehow it feels squandered, as it becomes a standard "stalk & kill" picture with little viewer involvement in what happens, though it is well directed by Guillermo Del Toro, who apparently had creative control taken away from him, and it shows. Appealing actors cannot save it.

    Okay, to date I have seen about every full-length Guillermo Del Toro movie with the exception of The Devil's Backbone. As of now he is very easily one of my favourite directors. I found out that this was the only movie out of his that he didn't like (for a fact he disowned it). This made me think about sitting down and watching it. The plot of this movie is after a huge epidemic has broken out in New York, a doctor creates a new type of bug called The Judas breed to combat the carriers of the disease (cockroaches) designed only to last 6 months. Three years later she finds a baby Judas breed. As she, her husband, a cop and a shoe-shiner looking for his missing son (Who's connected) They find bugs that are just as big as human beings, and the bugs see them as prey. Overall it was a good movie. But it was sort of "meh" whereas I enjoyed movies like the Hellboy movies, Cronos, Blade 2 and Pan's Labyrinth a whole lot more. It is better than some horror movies of the 90's and it maybe worth a watch if you like horror (but watch Cronos instead). I won't really watch the sequels, mainly because this movie ends off with a closed enough plot line. I did like it but not as much as Del Toro's other work.

    You have to be into a certain type of movie to really be able to appreciate this. It's a sci fi-horror type movie; what was known back in the 50's as a "creature feature." If you liked those kinds of movies, then you'll like this one. Perhaps surprisingly for the genre, it has a pretty solid cast (folks like Mira Sorvino, Charles S. Dutton, F. Murray Abraham and Josh Brolin are all in this) and as far as I was concerned the cast (including the lesser known ones) all did a pretty good job. The direction from Guillermo del Toro was excellent. He built the story nicely, and he made excellent use of the setting of dark and abandoned subway tunnels deep under New York City, creating the totally appropriate atmosphere for this kind of film. The story opens with a mysterious disease having hit New York, and children dying in large numbers. The disease is spread by cockroaches, and a scientist (played by Sorvino) is able to develop genetically enhanced insects that successfully wipe out the roaches. The news bugs are supposed to be sterile, and with a life span of only about six months, but somehow, they manage to reproduce, and they grow to an enormous size, taking up residence in those abandoned tunnels. The story, of course, is about trying to find a way to now wipe these pests off the map before they start to wipe us off the planet! This is very well done. It's tense and suspenseful. There are times when you really wonder how any of those who go into the tunnels searching for the things are going to manage to get out. The darkness adds to a very appropriate creepiness. What else would you expect - it's about giant bugs! Somewhat to my own surprise, I actually really enjoyed this. (8/10)

    At first glance, the idea of mutant cockroaches being able to disguise themselves as humans may sound like the most ridiculous idea for a movie to ever be proposed. And, nine times out of ten, you would be right. Yet, what if I told you that, despite the ridiculousness of the idea, the story was turned into a good movie? 1997's "Mimic" is that movie. Directed by Guillermo del Toro, the film stars Mira Sorvino as Dr. Tyler, a young scientist who, in an attempt to save New York's children from a deadly pathogen carried by the common cockroach, creates a new species of insect that decimates the cockroach population and eliminates the disease. After this new species has done its work, the bugs are supposed to die off. However, three years later, people begin disappearing, strange, dark figures are walking the streets at night and from there, it doesn't take too long for the good doctor to figure out that her creation has evolved into a life of its own. A big reason for the film's success is the quality of acting that we have here; despite the fact that they're making a big bug movie, everyone involved gives it their all and as a result, we actually care about the characters. You have Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam as the doctor's love interest, Charles S. Dutton as a grumpy but likable subway cop, Giancarlo Giannini as a man who's son (Alexander Goodwin) has a strange bond with the creatures, and, in a small role, F. Murray Abraham as Dr. Tyler's mentor. But its not just the actors that make the movie work; a lot of the film's power to thrill is due to del Toro, who is able to create a dark mood for the movie by using the creepy tunnels and underbelly of New York by igniting our imagination. After all, how many of us have heard the urban legends of alligators, monster rats, and other assorted things dwelling in the sewers and tunnels of the city that never sleeps? Another element that deserves to be praised is the special effects that are used for the creatures themselves. When you see them, you will have no doubt that the characters are really being chased by these things. Also starring Josh Brolin, Alix Koromzay, and in an almost unrecognizable bit part as a sewer worker, Norman Reedus. To sum it all up, if monsters, dark tunnels, good acting, and good storytelling excite you, watch "Mimic".

    Eerie film with astonishing images , suspenseful and original direction by Guilermo Del Toro . Three years ago entomologist Dr. Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) genetically created an insect to kill cockroaches carrying a virulent disease . For thousands of years, man has been evolution's greatest creation , now the insects are out to destroy their only predator, mankind . Susan and Peter (Jeremy Northam) are called in to investigate. This heart-pounding picture is full of suspense ,thrills , mystery, lots of gore and a storm criticism to genetic engineering . This slick monster-feast is a triumph of style , well paced and full of frightening scenes . It's packed with overwhelming body count , loathing scenes , grotesque killing, and rivers of red blood . Interesting as well as thought-provoking screenplay by Matthew Robbins and the same director ,screenwriters Matt Greenberg and John Sayles are uncredited in the movie, but were credited in some of the trailers . The movie delivers the goods with hair-rising chills and noisy scares when the giant cockroaches appear savagely stalking and attacking its preys , including children . This is an OK amusing juvenile with interesting characters and scientific plot but quite entertaining . It's remarkable for FX recreation the ferocious and carnivorous beast developing a bloodthirsty hunger for human eating . The actors give vigorous physical performances dodging the giant bugs recreated by means of make-up realized by Rob Bottin , adding the prolific computer generator, as usual . The mutant cockroaches , themselves, of course, are the real stars, and they're marvellous terrifying astounding, and quite convincing .The picture is smartly designed and stylishly photographed by Dan Laustsen . Thrilling and intriguing musical score by Marco Beltrani . The motion picture was well directed by Guillermo Del Toro , though the scene where Mira Sorvino and Jeremy Northam walk in the hall with all the sick kids lying in their beds was actually directed by Ole Bornedal, one of the producers on the film . Del Toro delivers the terror movie goods with sense of style , though was originally planned as a single 30-min. short as part of a feature of sci-fi/horror/comedy shorts by Miramax. Director Guillermo del Toro disowned the film after constant clashes with Bob Weinstein, who would frequently visit the set and make unreasonable demands about what should be shot, deviating away from the script , since then del Toro has never worked with the Weinsteins. Guillermo is an expert on murky atmosphere such as proved in &uml;Cronos&uml; , &uml;Pan's labyrinth&uml;, &uml;Hellboy I&uml; and &uml;Hellboy 2&uml;. The picture will appeal to horror buffs and Guillermo Del Toro fans . It's followed by two sequels : Mimic 2 with Alix Koromzay , John Polito and Bruno Campos ; and Mimic 3 with Lance Henriksen and Karl Geary .

    First, there's no denying that the creepy crawly fly-y creatures are really really cool, with their human-like mimicking and their seeming transformation into big big bugs. The world of these bugs is cool too - dark and dank, wet and oozy, drippy and shadowy, whether it's below-ground or above-ground. Why is it always night-time? Why is it always raining? That's just part of the B movie fun. And this movie is fun. And scary. OK, it has holes, but what I loved about these holes (the bugs doing nonsensical things, and the bugs being wiped out in one silly swoop, for example) was, they gave the movie a fun cheesy feel, which added a campy element to it. Even so, or maybe in part because of this, the movie is really good. You gotta have those campy false alarm, music building, heart racing, oh good, everybody is OK...for now... scenes. Doesn't mean they'll be OK next time! Mira Sorvino is out to lunch in this movie, as if she had something else on her mind all the time. But what would a good B movie be without some bad acting? But her bad acting is countered by the wonderful Charles S. Dutton as Leonard the transit policeman, who is just so good in that role. He is the star of every scene he's in. With his blues singing and liberal use of the S word, he provides an excellent comic foil to the horror. But he isn't intentionally doing comedy...he just has a great personality, especially in the face of doom. I had a good time watching Mimic, and you should too.

    I can't believe this movie has a 5.8 while the likes of something as sh*tty as "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" has a 6.7. For God's sake the first Quarantine has around a 6.0, and I'd rather stick a hot needle in my eye till it sizzled and popped (curtsey of "Under Siege 2") then go thru the grueling experience of watching that film again. This film is under the helm of Guillermo del Toro, and it has a number of merits going for it. While the story may be one we have seen before, the characters he fills it with are far from bland. Mira Sorvino is sexy as well as great lead female, Jeremy Northam is also very good and Charles S. Dutton is great. Also, Josh Brolin is very good in it, kind of an asshole, but good. And if you're a real del Toro fan, keep your eyes out for a cameo of Norman Reedus and Doug Jones. Another thing that separates this film from the bunch is incredible production design. Compared to the dull sets seen in "Quarantine", this film speaks volumes about the decay of mankind. Dingy, disgusting, dark, and decrepit, and that's just the d's that describe the awesome look of the film. And complimenting this is one of the maestro Marco Beltrami's master scores. Nice use of the eerie chorus adds greatly to many scenes. Where was "Quarantine" (s) score? Oh I forgot it was trying so hard to be 'realistic'. Thing is both films do have more or less seen before plots, but "Mimic" excels because it is so much more artistic at it. At the base of entertainment, film is still rooted in being an art form, and so hold "Mimic" to be in high caliber compared to the sh*tfest of most horror films today.

    I remember vividly going to see Mimic upon its release back on July 2nd 1998. It barely got into UK cinemas, and was dumped in the tiny Screen 5 at the old Odeon cinema in Edinburgh for all of one week before disappearing. They'd never do that to a Guillermo Del Toro film now that he's a popular director. But even back then his trademark imagery of insects, muck, and oppressive weather were thick throughout the movie. A strange virus carried by cockroaches is killing-off New York's kids until Entomologist (insect scientist) Susan Tyler (the tall, gorgeous, big-boobed Academy Award-winning Miro Sorvino, who just...vanished) and her boyfriend Peter Mann (Clive Owen's twin brother Jeremy Northam) create a new breed of cockroach to kill them off. With the children safe they all breath a sigh of relief. Then three years pass, with something sinister brewing beneath the city streets. People start to go missing in the subways, strange new insects are emerging from the grimy darkness, and what appears to be a man in a long coat is always watching from the gloomy corners. Del Toro's vision for the film was compromised by the interference of Harvey Weinstein, who foolishly contradicted his judgment (this being the same guy who greenlit Grindhouse!). The resulting movie was disowned by Del Toro, which is a shame since you can really see the potential behind it. The planned ending for hundreds of Mimics standing around in Time Square station would have been amazing, and a natural follow-on to the plot that precedes it. Instead the ending is rather lame, and the threat of the Mimics migrating through the tunnels and possibly taking over the world is ignored as soon as it's mentioned. A huge missed opportunity there. What a bleak, apocalyptic ending that would have been. The so-called Director's Cut (the best parts of the script were never actually filmed) restores some minor plot points and gives us alternate dialogue. The biggest addition is the fact that Miro Sorvino's character is pregnant, but it adds NOTHING to the story, and feels rudely tacked-on. A great example of a movie that good have been if only the producers had a clue what they were doing. For what it is...there are some decent moments to be had.

    The initial outbreak of Strickler's disease erupted suddenly. As a disease that preyed on young children it had a massive huge impact and fear spread quickly through the parents and grandparents of New York City. There were many casualties, with a greater number of children being adversely impacted for the rest of their lives. That was until entomologist  bug doctor  Dr Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) unleashed the Judas breed of genetically modified cockroaches into the grimy New York ecosystem. This supercharged bug exuded a goo that was like crack for the Strickler's spreading normal cockroaches, wiping out the entire disease carrying generation and saving countless young lives in the process. And that's just the first 6 minutes of Guillermo Del Toro's 90s thriller Mimic, 10% of one hour which I might add also managed to include the main title credits. However you look at it this was classic GDT, set the scene as quickly as possible before getting to the real scares, fluids, vivid images and various other oozings. (He managed an even better job with Blade 2, recapping the previous film, key characters and setting the tone in a similar length of time. Brevity and conciseness are two very underrated qualities that GDT has in spades.) The ensuing years were a little less hectic for Dr Tyler. Having found her hubbie Dr Peter Mann in the research process for the Judas breed the newly married couple settle down to married existence and more mundane bug analysis. That is until she recognizes some of the same traits of the Judas bug in some samples brought to her by some young local kids. This is exceptionally strange given that the genetically modded bugs were purpose built with 6 month expiry dates and were supposed to be incapable of breeding. Unfortunately despite the fact that they shouldn't even exist two years later there is even more troubling news. The bugs are now over 6 feet tall, vicious, apparently mad with power, and hungry. Initially it seems that the hunger was sated primarily with stray dogs, but there are only so many dogs in the NYC a lot of people though. In the early goings the only person to see the creatures was an 11 year old autistic boy who played the spoons and had a shoe fetish  I told you it was a Del Toro film  this despite the fact that they brazenly walked the alleys and subway tunnels by night, because being six foot tall and buggy sometimes isn't enough. But once Susan, Peter and a couple of cops Josh and Leonard (Josh Brolin and Charles S. Dutton) all find themselves deep under the subway system with an army of nasty bugs in pursuit and without a 6 foot tall can of Mortein, any semblance of tension and care vanishes, and the remainder of the film becomes a grab bag of scenes ripped from other films more deserving of science fiction classic status, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator among them. Apparently GDT started the film on his terms but found that his vision and style was swiftly diluted by an ever increasing army of studio staff all hell bent on crafting a generic Hollywood B movie  with the B standing for Boring, Banal, Bugs. Sure the signs are still there, I've spoken of the intro already, but a couple of other early scenes unwind menacingly, and he manages the near obligatory autopsy sequence filled with goo and disgusting organs being extracted. So while Mimic might appear to be your standard creepy-crawly on steroids flick, it manages to be a little more than that in the end. Not much more mind you, the first half of the film was generally solid and genuinely unsettling at times, but the second half turned into a stock standard serial killer movie with multiple Buggy Kruegers. There was no more room for scuttling and looming menacingly, these techniques thrown out the window to be replaced by high pitched cockroach screams and full frontal assaults. Final Rating  5.5 / 10. I didn't mind Mimic, but after seeing what Guillermo Del Toro was able to do with Blade 2 (and subsequently Hellboy) I feel that greenlighting a creepy bug flick  and then deliberately diluting the creepiness  seems like an opportunity missed.

However, three years later, people begin disappearing, strange, dark figures are walking the streets at night and from there, it doesn't take too long for the good doctor to figure out that her creation has evolved into a life of its own. A big reason for the film's success is the quality of acting that we have here; despite the fact that they're making a big bug movie, everyone involved gives it their all and as a result, we actually care about the characters. You have Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam as the doctor's love interest, Charles S. Dutton as a grumpy but likable subway cop, Giancarlo Giannini as a man who's son (Alexander Goodwin) has a strange bond with the creatures, and, in a small role, F. Murray Abraham as Dr. Tyler's mentor. But its not just the actors that make the movie work; a lot of the film's power to thrill is due to del Toro, who is able to create a dark mood for the movie by using the creepy tunnels and underbelly of New York by igniting our imagination. After all, how many of us have heard the urban legends of alligators, monster rats, and other assorted things dwelling in the sewers and tunnels of the city that never sleeps? Another element that deserves to be praised is the special effects that are used for the creatures themselves. When you see them, you will have no doubt that the characters are really being chased by these things. Also starring Josh Brolin, Alix Koromzay, and in an almost unrecognizable bit part as a sewer worker, Norman Reedus. To sum it all up, if monsters, dark tunnels, good acting, and good storytelling excite you, watch "Mimic".

    Eerie film with astonishing images , suspenseful and original direction by Guilermo Del Toro . Three years ago entomologist Dr. Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) genetically created an insect to kill cockroaches carrying a virulent disease . For thousands of years, man has been evolution's greatest creation , now the insects are out to destroy their only predator, mankind . Susan and Peter (Jeremy Northam) are called in to investigate. This heart-pounding picture is full of suspense ,thrills , mystery, lots of gore and a storm criticism to genetic engineering . This slick monster-feast is a triumph of style , well paced and full of frightening scenes . It's packed with overwhelming body count , loathing scenes , grotesque killing, and rivers of red blood . Interesting as well as thought-provoking screenplay by Matthew Robbins and the same director ,screenwriters Matt Greenberg and John Sayles are uncredited in the movie, but were credited in some of the trailers . The movie delivers the goods with hair-rising chills and noisy scares when the giant cockroaches appear savagely stalking and attacking its preys , including children . This is an OK amusing juvenile with interesting characters and scientific plot but quite entertaining . It's remarkable for FX recreation the ferocious and carnivorous beast developing a bloodthirsty hunger for human eating .

    First, there's no denying that the creepy crawly fly-y creatures are really really cool, with their human-like mimicking and their seeming transformation into big big bugs. The world of these bugs is cool too - dark and dank, wet and oozy, drippy and shadowy, whether it's below-ground or above-ground. Why is it always night-time? Why is it always raining? That's just part of the B movie fun. And this movie is fun. And scary. OK, it has holes, but what I loved about these holes (the bugs doing nonsensical things, and the bugs being wiped out in one silly swoop, for example) was, they gave the movie a fun cheesy feel, which added a campy element to it. Even so, or maybe in part because of this, the movie is really good. You gotta have those campy false alarm, music building, heart racing, oh good, everybody is OK...for now... scenes. Doesn't mean they'll be OK next time! Mira Sorvino is out to lunch in this movie, as if she had something else on her mind all the time. But what would a good B movie be without some bad acting? But her bad acting is countered by the wonderful Charles S. Dutton as Leonard the transit policeman, who is just so good in that role. He is the star of every scene he's in. With his blues singing and liberal use of the S word, he provides an excellent comic foil to the horror. But he isn't intentionally doing comedy...he just has a great personality, especially in the face of doom. I had a good time watching Mimic, and you should too.

    I can't believe this movie has a 5.8 while the likes of something as sh*tty as "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" has a 6.7. For God's sake the first Quarantine has around a 6.0, and I'd rather stick a hot needle in my eye till it sizzled and popped (curtsey of "Under Siege 2") then go thru the grueling experience of watching that film again. This film is under the helm of Guillermo del Toro, and it has a number of merits going for it. While the story may be one we have seen before, the characters he fills it with are far from bland. Mira Sorvino is sexy as well as great lead female, Jeremy Northam is also very good and Charles S. Dutton is great. Also, Josh Brolin is very good in it, kind of an asshole, but good. And if you're a real del Toro fan, keep your eyes out for a cameo of Norman Reedus and Doug Jones. Another thing that separates this film from the bunch is incredible production design. Compared to the dull sets seen in "Quarantine", this film speaks volumes about the decay of mankind. Dingy, disgusting, dark, and decrepit, and that's just the d's that describe the awesome look of the film. And complimenting this is one of the maestro Marco Beltrami's master scores. Nice use of the eerie chorus adds greatly to many scenes. Where was "Quarantine" (s) score? Oh I forgot it was trying so hard to be 'realistic'. Thing is both films do have more or less seen before plots, but "Mimic" excels because it is so much more artistic at it. At the base of entertainment, film is still rooted in being an art form, and so hold "Mimic" to be in high caliber compared to the sh*tfest of most horror films today.

    I remember vividly going to see Mimic upon its release back on July 2nd 1998. It barely got into UK cinemas, and was dumped in the tiny Screen 5 at the old Odeon cinema in Edinburgh for all of one week before disappearing. They'd never do that to a Guillermo Del Toro film now that he's a popular director. But even back then his trademark imagery of insects, muck, and oppressive weather were thick throughout the movie. A strange virus carried by cockroaches is killing-off New York's kids until Entomologist (insect scientist) Susan Tyler (the tall, gorgeous, big-boobed Academy Award-winning Miro Sorvino, who just...vanished) and her boyfriend Peter Mann (Clive Owen's twin brother Jeremy Northam) create a new breed of cockroach to kill them off. With the children safe they all breath a sigh of relief. Then three years pass, with something sinister brewing beneath the city streets. People start to go missing in the subways, strange new insects are emerging from the grimy darkness, and what appears to be a man in a long coat is always watching from the gloomy corners. Del Toro's vision for the film was compromised by the interference of Harvey Weinstein, who foolishly contradicted his judgment (this being the same guy who greenlit Grindhouse!). The resulting movie was disowned by Del Toro, which is a shame since you can really see the potential behind it. The planned ending for hundreds of Mimics standing around in Time Square station would have been amazing, and a natural follow-on to the plot that precedes it. Instead the ending is rather lame, and the threat of the Mimics migrating through the tunnels and possibly taking over the world is ignored as soon as it's mentioned. A huge missed opportunity there. What a bleak, apocalyptic ending that would have been. The so-called Director's Cut (the best parts of the script were never actually filmed) restores some minor plot points and gives us alternate dialogue. The biggest addition is the fact that Miro Sorvino's character is pregnant, but it adds NOTHING to the story, and feels rudely tacked-on. A great example of a movie that good have been if only the producers had a clue what they were doing. For what it is...there are some decent moments to be had.

    The initial outbreak of Strickler's disease erupted suddenly. As a disease that preyed on young children it had a massive huge impact and fear spread quickly through the parents and grandparents of New York City. There were many casualties, with a greater number of children being adversely impacted for the rest of their lives. That was until entomologist  bug doctor  Dr Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) unleashed the Judas breed of genetically modified cockroaches into the grimy New York ecosystem. This supercharged bug exuded a goo that was like crack for the Strickler's spreading normal cockroaches, wiping out the entire disease carrying generation and saving countless young lives in the process. And that's just the first 6 minutes of Guillermo Del Toro's 90s thriller Mimic, 10% of one hour which I might add also managed to include the main title credits. However you look at it this was classic GDT, set the scene as quickly as possible before getting to the real scares, fluids, vivid images and various other oozings. (He managed an even better job with Blade 2, recapping the previous film, key characters and setting the tone in a similar length of time. Brevity and conciseness are two very underrated qualities that GDT has in spades.) The ensuing years were a little less hectic for Dr Tyler. Having found her hubbie Dr Peter Mann in the research process for the Judas breed the newly married couple settle down to married existence and more mundane bug analysis. That is until she recognizes some of the same traits of the Judas bug in some samples brought to her by some young local kids. This is exceptionally strange given that the genetically modded bugs were purpose built with 6 month expiry dates and were supposed to be incapable of breeding. Unfortunately despite the fact that they shouldn't even exist two years later there is even more troubling news. The bugs are now over 6 feet tall, vicious, apparently mad with power, and hungry. Initially it seems that the hunger was sated primarily with stray dogs, but there are only so many dogs in the NYC a lot of people though. In the early goings the only person to see the creatures was an 11 year old autistic boy who played the spoons and had a shoe fetish  I told you it was a Del Toro film  this despite the fact that they brazenly walked the alleys and subway tunnels by night, because being six foot tall and buggy sometimes isn't enough. But once Susan, Peter and a couple of cops Josh and Leonard (Josh Brolin and Charles S. Dutton) all find themselves deep under the subway system with an army of nasty bugs in pursuit and without a 6 foot tall can of Mortein, any semblance of tension and care vanishes, and the remainder of the film becomes a grab bag of scenes ripped from other films more deserving of science fiction classic status, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator among them. Apparently GDT started the film on his terms but found that his vision and style was swiftly diluted by an ever increasing army of studio staff all hell bent on crafting a generic Hollywood B movie  with the B standing for Boring, Banal, Bugs. Sure the signs are still there, I've spoken of the intro already, but a couple of other early scenes unwind menacingly, and he manages the near obligatory autopsy sequence filled with goo and disgusting organs being extracted. So while Mimic might appear to be your standard creepy-crawly on steroids flick, it manages to be a little more than that in the end. Not much more mind you, the first half of the film was generally solid and genuinely unsettling at times, but the second half turned into a stock standard serial killer movie with multiple Buggy Kruegers. There was no more room for scuttling and looming menacingly, these techniques thrown out the window to be replaced by high pitched cockroach screams and full frontal assaults. Final Rating  5.5 / 10. I didn't mind Mimic, but after seeing what Guillermo Del Toro was able to do with Blade 2 (and subsequently Hellboy) I feel that greenlighting a creepy bug flick  and then deliberately diluting the creepiness  seems like an opportunity missed.

    A disease carried by common cockroaches is killing the children of Manhattan. In an effort to stop the epidemic an entomologist, Susan Tyler, creates a mutant breed of insect that secretes a fluid to kill the roaches. This mutant breed was engineered to die after one generation, but three years later Susan finds out that the species has survived and evolved into large monsters that can mimic human form...... After watching his movie, you will understand why Del Toro disowned it. The film has flashes of his brilliance, and at times, a wonderful creation is dying to get out, but then the Weinstein sheen takes over, and ruins the unique factor the movie had. No all Weinstein films have that sheen though, but you find more of their trademark 'editing' in smaller films like this, especially prolific directors who want to bring their genius to Hollywood. So what you are left with is a generic B-movie, with a beautiful Oscar winner in it, The Bad Guy from The Net, Diane Lanes Ex, and the brilliant Charles S. Dutton. The cast sounds good, but the material is dire. For the rest of the movie, we have kids selling bugs, the worst subways in the world, and a strange figure that spends half the film staring at people, and the other half attacking them, all in a really dark movie. The cast are better than this, and if Sorvino made better choices in 1997 rather than this and Romy and Michelle, she would be huge today. Shame really.

    Academy Award winners Mira Sorvino & F. Murray Abraham star in this thriller about an entomologist(Sorvino) who creates a mutant breed of insect to infect another breed of cockroaches that have been spreading a highly contagious disease decimating the children population. The disease is stopped, but three years later, a new problem emerges when that mutant breed(engineered to die off quickly) instead survive and thrive as large insects who can mimic human beings, and who must kill... There was much potential here for a compelling and exciting story, but somehow it feels squandered, as it becomes a standard "stalk & kill" picture with little viewer involvement in what happens, though it is well directed by Guillermo Del Toro, who apparently had creative control taken away from him, and it shows. Appealing actors cannot save it.

    Okay, to date I have seen about every full-length Guillermo Del Toro movie with the exception of The Devil's Backbone. As of now he is very easily one of my favourite directors. I found out that this was the only movie out of his that he didn't like (for a fact he disowned it). This made me think about sitting down and watching it. The plot of this movie is after a huge epidemic has broken out in New York, a doctor creates a new type of bug called The Judas breed to combat the carriers of the disease (cockroaches) designed only to last 6 months. Three years later she finds a baby Judas breed. As she, her husband, a cop and a shoe-shiner looking for his missing son (Who's connected) They find bugs that are just as big as human beings, and the bugs see them as prey. Overall it was a good movie. But it was sort of "meh" whereas I enjoyed movies like the Hellboy movies, Cronos, Blade 2 and Pan's Labyrinth a whole lot more. It is better than some horror movies of the 90's and it maybe worth a watch if you like horror (but watch Cronos instead). I won't really watch the sequels, mainly because this movie ends off with a closed enough plot line. I did like it but not as much as Del Toro's other work.

    You have to be into a certain type of movie to really be able to appreciate this. It's a sci fi-horror type movie; what was known back in the 50's as a "creature feature." If you liked those kinds of movies, then you'll like this one. Perhaps surprisingly for the genre, it has a pretty solid cast (folks like Mira Sorvino, Charles S. Dutton, F. Murray Abraham and Josh Brolin are all in this) and as far as I was concerned the cast (including the lesser known ones) all did a pretty good job. The direction from Guillermo del Toro was excellent. He built the story nicely, and he made excellent use of the setting of dark and abandoned subway tunnels deep under New York City, creating the totally appropriate atmosphere for this kind of film. The story opens with a mysterious disease having hit New York, and children dying in large numbers. The disease is spread by cockroaches, and a scientist (played by Sorvino) is able to develop genetically enhanced insects that successfully wipe out the roaches. The news bugs are supposed to be sterile, and with a life span of only about six months, but somehow, they manage to reproduce, and they grow to an enormous size, taking up residence in those abandoned tunnels. The story, of course, is about trying to find a way to now wipe these pests off the map before they start to wipe us off the planet! This is very well done. It's tense and suspenseful. There are times when you really wonder how any of those who go into the tunnels searching for the things are going to manage to get out. The darkness adds to a very appropriate creepiness. What else would you expect - it's about giant bugs! Somewhat to my own surprise, I actually really enjoyed this. (8/10)

    At first glance, the idea of mutant cockroaches being able to disguise themselves as humans may sound like the most ridiculous idea for a movie to ever be proposed. And, nine times out of ten, you would be right. Yet, what if I told you that, despite the ridiculousness of the idea, the story was turned into a good movie? 1997's "Mimic" is that movie. Directed by Guillermo del Toro, the film stars Mira Sorvino as Dr. Tyler, a young scientist who, in an attempt to save New York's children from a deadly pathogen carried by the common cockroach, creates a new species of insect that decimates the cockroach population and eliminates the disease. After this new species has done its work, the bugs are supposed to die off. However, three years later, people begin disappearing, strange, dark figures are walking the streets at night and from there, it doesn't take too long for the good doctor to figure out that her creation has evolved into a life of its own. A big reason for the film's success is the quality of acting that we have here; despite the fact that they're making a big bug movie, everyone involved gives it their all and as a result, we actually care about the characters. You have Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam as the doctor's love interest, Charles S. Dutton as a grumpy but likable subway cop, Giancarlo Giannini as a man who's son (Alexander Goodwin) has a strange bond with the creatures, and, in a small role, F. Murray Abraham as Dr. Tyler's mentor. But its not just the actors that make the movie work; a lot of the film's power to thrill is due to del Toro, who is able to create a dark mood for the movie by using the creepy tunnels and underbelly of New York by igniting our imagination. After all, how many of us have heard the urban legends of alligators, monster rats, and other assorted things dwelling in the sewers and tunnels of the city that never sleeps? Another element that deserves to be praised is the special effects that are used for the creatures themselves. When you see them, you will have no doubt that the characters are really being chased by these things. Also starring Josh Brolin, Alix Koromzay, and in an almost unrecognizable bit part as a sewer worker, Norman Reedus. To sum it all up, if monsters, dark tunnels, good acting, and good storytelling excite you, watch "Mimic".

With the children safe they all breath a sigh of relief. Then three years pass, with something sinister brewing beneath the city streets. People start to go missing in the subways, strange new insects are emerging from the grimy darkness, and what appears to be a man in a long coat is always watching from the gloomy corners. Del Toro's vision for the film was compromised by the interference of Harvey Weinstein, who foolishly contradicted his judgment (this being the same guy who greenlit Grindhouse!). The resulting movie was disowned by Del Toro, which is a shame since you can really see the potential behind it. The planned ending for hundreds of Mimics standing around in Time Square station would have been amazing, and a natural follow-on to the plot that precedes it. Instead the ending is rather lame, and the threat of the Mimics migrating through the tunnels and possibly taking over the world is ignored as soon as it's mentioned. A huge missed opportunity there. What a bleak, apocalyptic ending that would have been. The so-called Director's Cut (the best parts of the script were never actually filmed) restores some minor plot points and gives us alternate dialogue. The biggest addition is the fact that Miro Sorvino's character is pregnant, but it adds NOTHING to the story, and feels rudely tacked-on. A great example of a movie that good have been if only the producers had a clue what they were doing. For what it is...there are some decent moments to be had.

    The initial outbreak of Strickler's disease erupted suddenly. As a disease that preyed on young children it had a massive huge impact and fear spread quickly through the parents and grandparents of New York City. There were many casualties, with a greater number of children being adversely impacted for the rest of their lives. That was until entomologist  bug doctor  Dr Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) unleashed the Judas breed of genetically modified cockroaches into the grimy New York ecosystem. This supercharged bug exuded a goo that was like crack for the Strickler's spreading normal cockroaches, wiping out the entire disease carrying generation and saving countless young lives in the process. And that's just the first 6 minutes of Guillermo Del Toro's 90s thriller Mimic, 10% of one hour which I might add also managed to include the main title credits. However you look at it this was classic GDT, set the scene as quickly as possible before getting to the real scares, fluids, vivid images and various other oozings. (He managed an even better job with Blade 2, recapping the previous film, key characters and setting the tone in a similar length of time. Brevity and conciseness are two very underrated qualities that GDT has in spades.) The ensuing years were a little less hectic for Dr Tyler. Having found her hubbie Dr Peter Mann in the research process for the Judas breed the newly married couple settle down to married existence and more mundane bug analysis. That is until she recognizes some of the same traits of the Judas bug in some samples brought to her by some young local kids. This is exceptionally strange given that the genetically modded bugs were purpose built with 6 month expiry dates and were supposed to be incapable of breeding. Unfortunately despite the fact that they shouldn't even exist two years later there is even more troubling news. The bugs are now over 6 feet tall, vicious, apparently mad with power, and hungry. Initially it seems that the hunger was sated primarily with stray dogs, but there are only so many dogs in the NYC a lot of people though. In the early goings the only person to see the creatures was an 11 year old autistic boy who played the spoons and had a shoe fetish  I told you it was a Del Toro film  this despite the fact that they brazenly walked the alleys and subway tunnels by night, because being six foot tall and buggy sometimes isn't enough. But once Susan, Peter and a couple of cops Josh and Leonard (Josh Brolin and Charles S. Dutton) all find themselves deep under the subway system with an army of nasty bugs in pursuit and without a 6 foot tall can of Mortein, any semblance of tension and care vanishes, and the remainder of the film becomes a grab bag of scenes ripped from other films more deserving of science fiction classic status, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator among them. Apparently GDT started the film on his terms but found that his vision and style was swiftly diluted by an ever increasing army of studio staff all hell bent on crafting a generic Hollywood B movie  with the B standing for Boring, Banal, Bugs. Sure the signs are still there, I've spoken of the intro already, but a couple of other early scenes unwind menacingly, and he manages the near obligatory autopsy sequence filled with goo and disgusting organs being extracted. So while Mimic might appear to be your standard creepy-crawly on steroids flick, it manages to be a little more than that in the end. Not much more mind you, the first half of the film was generally solid and genuinely unsettling at times, but the second half turned into a stock standard serial killer movie with multiple Buggy Kruegers. There was no more room for scuttling and looming menacingly, these techniques thrown out the window to be replaced by high pitched cockroach screams and full frontal assaults. Final Rating  5.5 / 10. I didn't mind Mimic, but after seeing what Guillermo Del Toro was able to do with Blade 2 (and subsequently Hellboy) I feel that greenlighting a creepy bug flick  and then deliberately diluting the creepiness  seems like an opportunity missed.

    A disease carried by common cockroaches is killing the children of Manhattan. In an effort to stop the epidemic an entomologist, Susan Tyler, creates a mutant breed of insect that secretes a fluid to kill the roaches. This mutant breed was engineered to die after one generation, but three years later Susan finds out that the species has survived and evolved into large monsters that can mimic human form...... After watching his movie, you will understand why Del Toro disowned it. The film has flashes of his brilliance, and at times, a wonderful creation is dying to get out, but then the Weinstein sheen takes over, and ruins the unique factor the movie had. No all Weinstein films have that sheen though, but you find more of their trademark 'editing' in smaller films like this, especially prolific directors who want to bring their genius to Hollywood. So what you are left with is a generic B-movie, with a beautiful Oscar winner in it, The Bad Guy from The Net, Diane Lanes Ex, and the brilliant Charles S. Dutton. The cast sounds good, but the material is dire. For the rest of the movie, we have kids selling bugs, the worst subways in the world, and a strange figure that spends half the film staring at people, and the other half attacking them, all in a really dark movie. The cast are better than this, and if Sorvino made better choices in 1997 rather than this and Romy and Michelle, she would be huge today. Shame really.

    Academy Award winners Mira Sorvino & F. Murray Abraham star in this thriller about an entomologist(Sorvino) who creates a mutant breed of insect to infect another breed of cockroaches that have been spreading a highly contagious disease decimating the children population. The disease is stopped, but three years later, a new problem emerges when that mutant breed(engineered to die off quickly) instead survive and thrive as large insects who can mimic human beings, and who must kill... There was much potential here for a compelling and exciting story, but somehow it feels squandered, as it becomes a standard "stalk & kill" picture with little viewer involvement in what happens, though it is well directed by Guillermo Del Toro, who apparently had creative control taken away from him, and it shows. Appealing actors cannot save it.

    Okay, to date I have seen about every full-length Guillermo Del Toro movie with the exception of The Devil's Backbone. As of now he is very easily one of my favourite directors. I found out that this was the only movie out of his that he didn't like (for a fact he disowned it). This made me think about sitting down and watching it. The plot of this movie is after a huge epidemic has broken out in New York, a doctor creates a new type of bug called The Judas breed to combat the carriers of the disease (cockroaches) designed only to last 6 months. Three years later she finds a baby Judas breed. As she, her husband, a cop and a shoe-shiner looking for his missing son (Who's connected) They find bugs that are just as big as human beings, and the bugs see them as prey. Overall it was a good movie. But it was sort of "meh" whereas I enjoyed movies like the Hellboy movies, Cronos, Blade 2 and Pan's Labyrinth a whole lot more. It is better than some horror movies of the 90's and it maybe worth a watch if you like horror (but watch Cronos instead). I won't really watch the sequels, mainly because this movie ends off with a closed enough plot line. I did like it but not as much as Del Toro's other work.

    You have to be into a certain type of movie to really be able to appreciate this. It's a sci fi-horror type movie; what was known back in the 50's as a "creature feature." If you liked those kinds of movies, then you'll like this one. Perhaps surprisingly for the genre, it has a pretty solid cast (folks like Mira Sorvino, Charles S. Dutton, F. Murray Abraham and Josh Brolin are all in this) and as far as I was concerned the cast (including the lesser known ones) all did a pretty good job. The direction from Guillermo del Toro was excellent. He built the story nicely, and he made excellent use of the setting of dark and abandoned subway tunnels deep under New York City, creating the totally appropriate atmosphere for this kind of film. The story opens with a mysterious disease having hit New York, and children dying in large numbers. The disease is spread by cockroaches, and a scientist (played by Sorvino) is able to develop genetically enhanced insects that successfully wipe out the roaches. The news bugs are supposed to be sterile, and with a life span of only about six months, but somehow, they manage to reproduce, and they grow to an enormous size, taking up residence in those abandoned tunnels. The story, of course, is about trying to find a way to now wipe these pests off the map before they start to wipe us off the planet! This is very well done. It's tense and suspenseful. There are times when you really wonder how any of those who go into the tunnels searching for the things are going to manage to get out. The darkness adds to a very appropriate creepiness. What else would you expect - it's about giant bugs! Somewhat to my own surprise, I actually really enjoyed this. (8/10)

    At first glance, the idea of mutant cockroaches being able to disguise themselves as humans may sound like the most ridiculous idea for a movie to ever be proposed. And, nine times out of ten, you would be right. Yet, what if I told you that, despite the ridiculousness of the idea, the story was turned into a good movie? 1997's "Mimic" is that movie. Directed by Guillermo del Toro, the film stars Mira Sorvino as Dr. Tyler, a young scientist who, in an attempt to save New York's children from a deadly pathogen carried by the common cockroach, creates a new species of insect that decimates the cockroach population and eliminates the disease. After this new species has done its work, the bugs are supposed to die off. However, three years later, people begin disappearing, strange, dark figures are walking the streets at night and from there, it doesn't take too long for the good doctor to figure out that her creation has evolved into a life of its own. A big reason for the film's success is the quality of acting that we have here; despite the fact that they're making a big bug movie, everyone involved gives it their all and as a result, we actually care about the characters. You have Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam as the doctor's love interest, Charles S. Dutton as a grumpy but likable subway cop, Giancarlo Giannini as a man who's son (Alexander Goodwin) has a strange bond with the creatures, and, in a small role, F. Murray Abraham as Dr. Tyler's mentor. But its not just the actors that make the movie work; a lot of the film's power to thrill is due to del Toro, who is able to create a dark mood for the movie by using the creepy tunnels and underbelly of New York by igniting our imagination. After all, how many of us have heard the urban legends of alligators, monster rats, and other assorted things dwelling in the sewers and tunnels of the city that never sleeps? Another element that deserves to be praised is the special effects that are used for the creatures themselves. When you see them, you will have no doubt that the characters are really being chased by these things. Also starring Josh Brolin, Alix Koromzay, and in an almost unrecognizable bit part as a sewer worker, Norman Reedus. To sum it all up, if monsters, dark tunnels, good acting, and good storytelling excite you, watch "Mimic".

    Eerie film with astonishing images , suspenseful and original direction by Guilermo Del Toro . Three years ago entomologist Dr. Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) genetically created an insect to kill cockroaches carrying a virulent disease . For thousands of years, man has been evolution's greatest creation , now the insects are out to destroy their only predator, mankind . Susan and Peter (Jeremy Northam) are called in to investigate. This heart-pounding picture is full of suspense ,thrills , mystery, lots of gore and a storm criticism to genetic engineering . This slick monster-feast is a triumph of style , well paced and full of frightening scenes . It's packed with overwhelming body count , loathing scenes , grotesque killing, and rivers of red blood . Interesting as well as thought-provoking screenplay by Matthew Robbins and the same director ,screenwriters Matt Greenberg and John Sayles are uncredited in the movie, but were credited in some of the trailers . The movie delivers the goods with hair-rising chills and noisy scares when the giant cockroaches appear savagely stalking and attacking its preys , including children . This is an OK amusing juvenile with interesting characters and scientific plot but quite entertaining . It's remarkable for FX recreation the ferocious and carnivorous beast developing a bloodthirsty hunger for human eating . The actors give vigorous physical performances dodging the giant bugs recreated by means of make-up realized by Rob Bottin , adding the prolific computer generator, as usual . The mutant cockroaches , themselves, of course, are the real stars, and they're marvellous terrifying astounding, and quite convincing .The picture is smartly designed and stylishly photographed by Dan Laustsen . Thrilling and intriguing musical score by Marco Beltrani . The motion picture was well directed by Guillermo Del Toro , though the scene where Mira Sorvino and Jeremy Northam walk in the hall with all the sick kids lying in their beds was actually directed by Ole Bornedal, one of the producers on the film . Del Toro delivers the terror movie goods with sense of style , though was originally planned as a single 30-min. short as part of a feature of sci-fi/horror/comedy shorts by Miramax. Director Guillermo del Toro disowned the film after constant clashes with Bob Weinstein, who would frequently visit the set and make unreasonable demands about what should be shot, deviating away from the script , since then del Toro has never worked with the Weinsteins. Guillermo is an expert on murky atmosphere such as proved in &uml;Cronos&uml; , &uml;Pan's labyrinth&uml;, &uml;Hellboy I&uml; and &uml;Hellboy 2&uml;. The picture will appeal to horror buffs and Guillermo Del Toro fans . It's followed by two sequels : Mimic 2 with Alix Koromzay , John Polito and Bruno Campos ; and Mimic 3 with Lance Henriksen and Karl Geary .

    First, there's no denying that the creepy crawly fly-y creatures are really really cool, with their human-like mimicking and their seeming transformation into big big bugs. The world of these bugs is cool too - dark and dank, wet and oozy, drippy and shadowy, whether it's below-ground or above-ground. Why is it always night-time? Why is it always raining? That's just part of the B movie fun. And this movie is fun. And scary. OK, it has holes, but what I loved about these holes (the bugs doing nonsensical things, and the bugs being wiped out in one silly swoop, for example) was, they gave the movie a fun cheesy feel, which added a campy element to it. Even so, or maybe in part because of this, the movie is really good. You gotta have those campy false alarm, music building, heart racing, oh good, everybody is OK...for now... scenes. Doesn't mean they'll be OK next time! Mira Sorvino is out to lunch in this movie, as if she had something else on her mind all the time. But what would a good B movie be without some bad acting? But her bad acting is countered by the wonderful Charles S. Dutton as Leonard the transit policeman, who is just so good in that role. He is the star of every scene he's in. With his blues singing and liberal use of the S word, he provides an excellent comic foil to the horror. But he isn't intentionally doing comedy...he just has a great personality, especially in the face of doom. I had a good time watching Mimic, and you should too.

    I can't believe this movie has a 5.8 while the likes of something as sh*tty as "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" has a 6.7. For God's sake the first Quarantine has around a 6.0, and I'd rather stick a hot needle in my eye till it sizzled and popped (curtsey of "Under Siege 2") then go thru the grueling experience of watching that film again. This film is under the helm of Guillermo del Toro, and it has a number of merits going for it. While the story may be one we have seen before, the characters he fills it with are far from bland. Mira Sorvino is sexy as well as great lead female, Jeremy Northam is also very good and Charles S. Dutton is great. Also, Josh Brolin is very good in it, kind of an asshole, but good. And if you're a real del Toro fan, keep your eyes out for a cameo of Norman Reedus and Doug Jones. Another thing that separates this film from the bunch is incredible production design. Compared to the dull sets seen in "Quarantine", this film speaks volumes about the decay of mankind. Dingy, disgusting, dark, and decrepit, and that's just the d's that describe the awesome look of the film. And complimenting this is one of the maestro Marco Beltrami's master scores. Nice use of the eerie chorus adds greatly to many scenes. Where was "Quarantine" (s) score? Oh I forgot it was trying so hard to be 'realistic'. Thing is both films do have more or less seen before plots, but "Mimic" excels because it is so much more artistic at it. At the base of entertainment, film is still rooted in being an art form, and so hold "Mimic" to be in high caliber compared to the sh*tfest of most horror films today.

    I remember vividly going to see Mimic upon its release back on July 2nd 1998. It barely got into UK cinemas, and was dumped in the tiny Screen 5 at the old Odeon cinema in Edinburgh for all of one week before disappearing. They'd never do that to a Guillermo Del Toro film now that he's a popular director. But even back then his trademark imagery of insects, muck, and oppressive weather were thick throughout the movie. A strange virus carried by cockroaches is killing-off New York's kids until Entomologist (insect scientist) Susan Tyler (the tall, gorgeous, big-boobed Academy Award-winning Miro Sorvino, who just...vanished) and her boyfriend Peter Mann (Clive Owen's twin brother Jeremy Northam) create a new breed of cockroach to kill them off. With the children safe they all breath a sigh of relief. Then three years pass, with something sinister brewing beneath the city streets. People start to go missing in the subways, strange new insects are emerging from the grimy darkness, and what appears to be a man in a long coat is always watching from the gloomy corners. Del Toro's vision for the film was compromised by the interference of Harvey Weinstein, who foolishly contradicted his judgment (this being the same guy who greenlit Grindhouse!). The resulting movie was disowned by Del Toro, which is a shame since you can really see the potential behind it. The planned ending for hundreds of Mimics standing around in Time Square station would have been amazing, and a natural follow-on to the plot that precedes it. Instead the ending is rather lame, and the threat of the Mimics migrating through the tunnels and possibly taking over the world is ignored as soon as it's mentioned. A huge missed opportunity there. What a bleak, apocalyptic ending that would have been. The so-called Director's Cut (the best parts of the script were never actually filmed) restores some minor plot points and gives us alternate dialogue.

Overall it was a good movie. But it was sort of "meh" whereas I enjoyed movies like the Hellboy movies, Cronos, Blade 2 and Pan's Labyrinth a whole lot more. It is better than some horror movies of the 90's and it maybe worth a watch if you like horror (but watch Cronos instead). I won't really watch the sequels, mainly because this movie ends off with a closed enough plot line. I did like it but not as much as Del Toro's other work.

    You have to be into a certain type of movie to really be able to appreciate this. It's a sci fi-horror type movie; what was known back in the 50's as a "creature feature." If you liked those kinds of movies, then you'll like this one. Perhaps surprisingly for the genre, it has a pretty solid cast (folks like Mira Sorvino, Charles S. Dutton, F. Murray Abraham and Josh Brolin are all in this) and as far as I was concerned the cast (including the lesser known ones) all did a pretty good job. The direction from Guillermo del Toro was excellent. He built the story nicely, and he made excellent use of the setting of dark and abandoned subway tunnels deep under New York City, creating the totally appropriate atmosphere for this kind of film. The story opens with a mysterious disease having hit New York, and children dying in large numbers. The disease is spread by cockroaches, and a scientist (played by Sorvino) is able to develop genetically enhanced insects that successfully wipe out the roaches. The news bugs are supposed to be sterile, and with a life span of only about six months, but somehow, they manage to reproduce, and they grow to an enormous size, taking up residence in those abandoned tunnels. The story, of course, is about trying to find a way to now wipe these pests off the map before they start to wipe us off the planet! This is very well done. It's tense and suspenseful. There are times when you really wonder how any of those who go into the tunnels searching for the things are going to manage to get out. The darkness adds to a very appropriate creepiness. What else would you expect - it's about giant bugs! Somewhat to my own surprise, I actually really enjoyed this. (8/10)

    At first glance, the idea of mutant cockroaches being able to disguise themselves as humans may sound like the most ridiculous idea for a movie to ever be proposed. And, nine times out of ten, you would be right. Yet, what if I told you that, despite the ridiculousness of the idea, the story was turned into a good movie? 1997's "Mimic" is that movie. Directed by Guillermo del Toro, the film stars Mira Sorvino as Dr. Tyler, a young scientist who, in an attempt to save New York's children from a deadly pathogen carried by the common cockroach, creates a new species of insect that decimates the cockroach population and eliminates the disease. After this new species has done its work, the bugs are supposed to die off. However, three years later, people begin disappearing, strange, dark figures are walking the streets at night and from there, it doesn't take too long for the good doctor to figure out that her creation has evolved into a life of its own. A big reason for the film's success is the quality of acting that we have here; despite the fact that they're making a big bug movie, everyone involved gives it their all and as a result, we actually care about the characters. You have Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam as the doctor's love interest, Charles S. Dutton as a grumpy but likable subway cop, Giancarlo Giannini as a man who's son (Alexander Goodwin) has a strange bond with the creatures, and, in a small role, F. Murray Abraham as Dr. Tyler's mentor. But its not just the actors that make the movie work; a lot of the film's power to thrill is due to del Toro, who is able to create a dark mood for the movie by using the creepy tunnels and underbelly of New York by igniting our imagination. After all, how many of us have heard the urban legends of alligators, monster rats, and other assorted things dwelling in the sewers and tunnels of the city that never sleeps? Another element that deserves to be praised is the special effects that are used for the creatures themselves. When you see them, you will have no doubt that the characters are really being chased by these things. Also starring Josh Brolin, Alix Koromzay, and in an almost unrecognizable bit part as a sewer worker, Norman Reedus. To sum it all up, if monsters, dark tunnels, good acting, and good storytelling excite you, watch "Mimic".

    First, there's no denying that the creepy crawly fly-y creatures are really really cool, with their human-like mimicking and their seeming transformation into big big bugs. The world of these bugs is cool too - dark and dank, wet and oozy, drippy and shadowy, whether it's below-ground or above-ground. Why is it always night-time? Why is it always raining? That's just part of the B movie fun. And this movie is fun. And scary. OK, it has holes, but what I loved about these holes (the bugs doing nonsensical things, and the bugs being wiped out in one silly swoop, for example) was, they gave the movie a fun cheesy feel, which added a campy element to it. Even so, or maybe in part because of this, the movie is really good. You gotta have those campy false alarm, music building, heart racing, oh good, everybody is OK...for now... scenes. Doesn't mean they'll be OK next time! Mira Sorvino is out to lunch in this movie, as if she had something else on her mind all the time. But what would a good B movie be without some bad acting? But her bad acting is countered by the wonderful Charles S. Dutton as Leonard the transit policeman, who is just so good in that role. He is the star of every scene he's in. With his blues singing and liberal use of the S word, he provides an excellent comic foil to the horror. But he isn't intentionally doing comedy...he just has a great personality, especially in the face of doom. I had a good time watching Mimic, and you should too.

    I can't believe this movie has a 5.8 while the likes of something as sh*tty as "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" has a 6.7. For God's sake the first Quarantine has around a 6.0, and I'd rather stick a hot needle in my eye till it sizzled and popped (curtsey of "Under Siege 2") then go thru the grueling experience of watching that film again. This film is under the helm of Guillermo del Toro, and it has a number of merits going for it. While the story may be one we have seen before, the characters he fills it with are far from bland. Mira Sorvino is sexy as well as great lead female, Jeremy Northam is also very good and Charles S. Dutton is great. Also, Josh Brolin is very good in it, kind of an asshole, but good. And if you're a real del Toro fan, keep your eyes out for a cameo of Norman Reedus and Doug Jones. Another thing that separates this film from the bunch is incredible production design. Compared to the dull sets seen in "Quarantine", this film speaks volumes about the decay of mankind. Dingy, disgusting, dark, and decrepit, and that's just the d's that describe the awesome look of the film. And complimenting this is one of the maestro Marco Beltrami's master scores. Nice use of the eerie chorus adds greatly to many scenes. Where was "Quarantine" (s) score? Oh I forgot it was trying so hard to be 'realistic'. Thing is both films do have more or less seen before plots, but "Mimic" excels because it is so much more artistic at it. At the base of entertainment, film is still rooted in being an art form, and so hold "Mimic" to be in high caliber compared to the sh*tfest of most horror films today.

    I remember vividly going to see Mimic upon its release back on July 2nd 1998. It barely got into UK cinemas, and was dumped in the tiny Screen 5 at the old Odeon cinema in Edinburgh for all of one week before disappearing. They'd never do that to a Guillermo Del Toro film now that he's a popular director. But even back then his trademark imagery of insects, muck, and oppressive weather were thick throughout the movie. A strange virus carried by cockroaches is killing-off New York's kids until Entomologist (insect scientist) Susan Tyler (the tall, gorgeous, big-boobed Academy Award-winning Miro Sorvino, who just...vanished) and her boyfriend Peter Mann (Clive Owen's twin brother Jeremy Northam) create a new breed of cockroach to kill them off. With the children safe they all breath a sigh of relief. Then three years pass, with something sinister brewing beneath the city streets. People start to go missing in the subways, strange new insects are emerging from the grimy darkness, and what appears to be a man in a long coat is always watching from the gloomy corners. Del Toro's vision for the film was compromised by the interference of Harvey Weinstein, who foolishly contradicted his judgment (this being the same guy who greenlit Grindhouse!). The resulting movie was disowned by Del Toro, which is a shame since you can really see the potential behind it. The planned ending for hundreds of Mimics standing around in Time Square station would have been amazing, and a natural follow-on to the plot that precedes it. Instead the ending is rather lame, and the threat of the Mimics migrating through the tunnels and possibly taking over the world is ignored as soon as it's mentioned. A huge missed opportunity there. What a bleak, apocalyptic ending that would have been. The so-called Director's Cut (the best parts of the script were never actually filmed) restores some minor plot points and gives us alternate dialogue. The biggest addition is the fact that Miro Sorvino's character is pregnant, but it adds NOTHING to the story, and feels rudely tacked-on. A great example of a movie that good have been if only the producers had a clue what they were doing. For what it is...there are some decent moments to be had.

    The initial outbreak of Strickler's disease erupted suddenly. As a disease that preyed on young children it had a massive huge impact and fear spread quickly through the parents and grandparents of New York City. There were many casualties, with a greater number of children being adversely impacted for the rest of their lives. That was until entomologist  bug doctor  Dr Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) unleashed the Judas breed of genetically modified cockroaches into the grimy New York ecosystem. This supercharged bug exuded a goo that was like crack for the Strickler's spreading normal cockroaches, wiping out the entire disease carrying generation and saving countless young lives in the process. And that's just the first 6 minutes of Guillermo Del Toro's 90s thriller Mimic, 10% of one hour which I might add also managed to include the main title credits. However you look at it this was classic GDT, set the scene as quickly as possible before getting to the real scares, fluids, vivid images and various other oozings. (He managed an even better job with Blade 2, recapping the previous film, key characters and setting the tone in a similar length of time. Brevity and conciseness are two very underrated qualities that GDT has in spades.) The ensuing years were a little less hectic for Dr Tyler. Having found her hubbie Dr Peter Mann in the research process for the Judas breed the newly married couple settle down to married existence and more mundane bug analysis. That is until she recognizes some of the same traits of the Judas bug in some samples brought to her by some young local kids. This is exceptionally strange given that the genetically modded bugs were purpose built with 6 month expiry dates and were supposed to be incapable of breeding. Unfortunately despite the fact that they shouldn't even exist two years later there is even more troubling news. The bugs are now over 6 feet tall, vicious, apparently mad with power, and hungry. Initially it seems that the hunger was sated primarily with stray dogs, but there are only so many dogs in the NYC a lot of people though. In the early goings the only person to see the creatures was an 11 year old autistic boy who played the spoons and had a shoe fetish  I told you it was a Del Toro film  this despite the fact that they brazenly walked the alleys and subway tunnels by night, because being six foot tall and buggy sometimes isn't enough. But once Susan, Peter and a couple of cops Josh and Leonard (Josh Brolin and Charles S. Dutton) all find themselves deep under the subway system with an army of nasty bugs in pursuit and without a 6 foot tall can of Mortein, any semblance of tension and care vanishes, and the remainder of the film becomes a grab bag of scenes ripped from other films more deserving of science fiction classic status, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator among them. Apparently GDT started the film on his terms but found that his vision and style was swiftly diluted by an ever increasing army of studio staff all hell bent on crafting a generic Hollywood B movie  with the B standing for Boring, Banal, Bugs. Sure the signs are still there, I've spoken of the intro already, but a couple of other early scenes unwind menacingly, and he manages the near obligatory autopsy sequence filled with goo and disgusting organs being extracted. So while Mimic might appear to be your standard creepy-crawly on steroids flick, it manages to be a little more than that in the end. Not much more mind you, the first half of the film was generally solid and genuinely unsettling at times, but the second half turned into a stock standard serial killer movie with multiple Buggy Kruegers. There was no more room for scuttling and looming menacingly, these techniques thrown out the window to be replaced by high pitched cockroach screams and full frontal assaults. Final Rating  5.5 / 10. I didn't mind Mimic, but after seeing what Guillermo Del Toro was able to do with Blade 2 (and subsequently Hellboy) I feel that greenlighting a creepy bug flick  and then deliberately diluting the creepiness  seems like an opportunity missed.

    A disease carried by common cockroaches is killing the children of Manhattan. In an effort to stop the epidemic an entomologist, Susan Tyler, creates a mutant breed of insect that secretes a fluid to kill the roaches. This mutant breed was engineered to die after one generation, but three years later Susan finds out that the species has survived and evolved into large monsters that can mimic human form...... After watching his movie, you will understand why Del Toro disowned it. The film has flashes of his brilliance, and at times, a wonderful creation is dying to get out, but then the Weinstein sheen takes over, and ruins the unique factor the movie had. No all Weinstein films have that sheen though, but you find more of their trademark 'editing' in smaller films like this, especially prolific directors who want to bring their genius to Hollywood. So what you are left with is a generic B-movie, with a beautiful Oscar winner in it, The Bad Guy from The Net, Diane Lanes Ex, and the brilliant Charles S. Dutton. The cast sounds good, but the material is dire. For the rest of the movie, we have kids selling bugs, the worst subways in the world, and a strange figure that spends half the film staring at people, and the other half attacking them, all in a really dark movie. The cast are better than this, and if Sorvino made better choices in 1997 rather than this and Romy and Michelle, she would be huge today. Shame really.

    Academy Award winners Mira Sorvino & F. Murray Abraham star in this thriller about an entomologist(Sorvino) who creates a mutant breed of insect to infect another breed of cockroaches that have been spreading a highly contagious disease decimating the children population. The disease is stopped, but three years later, a new problem emerges when that mutant breed(engineered to die off quickly) instead survive and thrive as large insects who can mimic human beings, and who must kill... There was much potential here for a compelling and exciting story, but somehow it feels squandered, as it becomes a standard "stalk & kill" picture with little viewer involvement in what happens, though it is well directed by Guillermo Del Toro, who apparently had creative control taken away from him, and it shows. Appealing actors cannot save it.

    Okay, to date I have seen about every full-length Guillermo Del Toro movie with the exception of The Devil's Backbone. As of now he is very easily one of my favourite directors. I found out that this was the only movie out of his that he didn't like (for a fact he disowned it). This made me think about sitting down and watching it. The plot of this movie is after a huge epidemic has broken out in New York, a doctor creates a new type of bug called The Judas breed to combat the carriers of the disease (cockroaches) designed only to last 6 months. Three years later she finds a baby Judas breed. As she, her husband, a cop and a shoe-shiner looking for his missing son (Who's connected) They find bugs that are just as big as human beings, and the bugs see them as prey. Overall it was a good movie. But it was sort of "meh" whereas I enjoyed movies like the Hellboy movies, Cronos, Blade 2 and Pan's Labyrinth a whole lot more. It is better than some horror movies of the 90's and it maybe worth a watch if you like horror (but watch Cronos instead). I won't really watch the sequels, mainly because this movie ends off with a closed enough plot line. I did like it but not as much as Del Toro's other work.

But her bad acting is countered by the wonderful Charles S. Dutton as Leonard the transit policeman, who is just so good in that role. He is the star of every scene he's in. With his blues singing and liberal use of the S word, he provides an excellent comic foil to the horror. But he isn't intentionally doing comedy...he just has a great personality, especially in the face of doom. I had a good time watching Mimic, and you should too.

    I can't believe this movie has a 5.8 while the likes of something as sh*tty as "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" has a 6.7. For God's sake the first Quarantine has around a 6.0, and I'd rather stick a hot needle in my eye till it sizzled and popped (curtsey of "Under Siege 2") then go thru the grueling experience of watching that film again. This film is under the helm of Guillermo del Toro, and it has a number of merits going for it. While the story may be one we have seen before, the characters he fills it with are far from bland. Mira Sorvino is sexy as well as great lead female, Jeremy Northam is also very good and Charles S. Dutton is great. Also, Josh Brolin is very good in it, kind of an asshole, but good. And if you're a real del Toro fan, keep your eyes out for a cameo of Norman Reedus and Doug Jones. Another thing that separates this film from the bunch is incredible production design. Compared to the dull sets seen in "Quarantine", this film speaks volumes about the decay of mankind. Dingy, disgusting, dark, and decrepit, and that's just the d's that describe the awesome look of the film. And complimenting this is one of the maestro Marco Beltrami's master scores. Nice use of the eerie chorus adds greatly to many scenes. Where was "Quarantine" (s) score? Oh I forgot it was trying so hard to be 'realistic'. Thing is both films do have more or less seen before plots, but "Mimic" excels because it is so much more artistic at it. At the base of entertainment, film is still rooted in being an art form, and so hold "Mimic" to be in high caliber compared to the sh*tfest of most horror films today.

    I remember vividly going to see Mimic upon its release back on July 2nd 1998. It barely got into UK cinemas, and was dumped in the tiny Screen 5 at the old Odeon cinema in Edinburgh for all of one week before disappearing. They'd never do that to a Guillermo Del Toro film now that he's a popular director. But even back then his trademark imagery of insects, muck, and oppressive weather were thick throughout the movie. A strange virus carried by cockroaches is killing-off New York's kids until Entomologist (insect scientist) Susan Tyler (the tall, gorgeous, big-boobed Academy Award-winning Miro Sorvino, who just...vanished) and her boyfriend Peter Mann (Clive Owen's twin brother Jeremy Northam) create a new breed of cockroach to kill them off. With the children safe they all breath a sigh of relief. Then three years pass, with something sinister brewing beneath the city streets. People start to go missing in the subways, strange new insects are emerging from the grimy darkness, and what appears to be a man in a long coat is always watching from the gloomy corners. Del Toro's vision for the film was compromised by the interference of Harvey Weinstein, who foolishly contradicted his judgment (this being the same guy who greenlit Grindhouse!). The resulting movie was disowned by Del Toro, which is a shame since you can really see the potential behind it. The planned ending for hundreds of Mimics standing around in Time Square station would have been amazing, and a natural follow-on to the plot that precedes it. Instead the ending is rather lame, and the threat of the Mimics migrating through the tunnels and possibly taking over the world is ignored as soon as it's mentioned. A huge missed opportunity there. What a bleak, apocalyptic ending that would have been. The so-called Director's Cut (the best parts of the script were never actually filmed) restores some minor plot points and gives us alternate dialogue. The biggest addition is the fact that Miro Sorvino's character is pregnant, but it adds NOTHING to the story, and feels rudely tacked-on. A great example of a movie that good have been if only the producers had a clue what they were doing. For what it is...there are some decent moments to be had.

    The initial outbreak of Strickler's disease erupted suddenly. As a disease that preyed on young children it had a massive huge impact and fear spread quickly through the parents and grandparents of New York City. There were many casualties, with a greater number of children being adversely impacted for the rest of their lives. That was until entomologist  bug doctor  Dr Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) unleashed the Judas breed of genetically modified cockroaches into the grimy New York ecosystem. This supercharged bug exuded a goo that was like crack for the Strickler's spreading normal cockroaches, wiping out the entire disease carrying generation and saving countless young lives in the process. And that's just the first 6 minutes of Guillermo Del Toro's 90s thriller Mimic, 10% of one hour which I might add also managed to include the main title credits. However you look at it this was classic GDT, set the scene as quickly as possible before getting to the real scares, fluids, vivid images and various other oozings. (He managed an even better job with Blade 2, recapping the previous film, key characters and setting the tone in a similar length of time. Brevity and conciseness are two very underrated qualities that GDT has in spades.) The ensuing years were a little less hectic for Dr Tyler. Having found her hubbie Dr Peter Mann in the research process for the Judas breed the newly married couple settle down to married existence and more mundane bug analysis. That is until she recognizes some of the same traits of the Judas bug in some samples brought to her by some young local kids. This is exceptionally strange given that the genetically modded bugs were purpose built with 6 month expiry dates and were supposed to be incapable of breeding. Unfortunately despite the fact that they shouldn't even exist two years later there is even more troubling news. The bugs are now over 6 feet tall, vicious, apparently mad with power, and hungry. Initially it seems that the hunger was sated primarily with stray dogs, but there are only so many dogs in the NYC a lot of people though. In the early goings the only person to see the creatures was an 11 year old autistic boy who played the spoons and had a shoe fetish  I told you it was a Del Toro film  this despite the fact that they brazenly walked the alleys and subway tunnels by night, because being six foot tall and buggy sometimes isn't enough. But once Susan, Peter and a couple of cops Josh and Leonard (Josh Brolin and Charles S. Dutton) all find themselves deep under the subway system with an army of nasty bugs in pursuit and without a 6 foot tall can of Mortein, any semblance of tension and care vanishes, and the remainder of the film becomes a grab bag of scenes ripped from other films more deserving of science fiction classic status, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator among them. Apparently GDT started the film on his terms but found that his vision and style was swiftly diluted by an ever increasing army of studio staff all hell bent on crafting a generic Hollywood B movie  with the B standing for Boring, Banal, Bugs. Sure the signs are still there, I've spoken of the intro already, but a couple of other early scenes unwind menacingly, and he manages the near obligatory autopsy sequence filled with goo and disgusting organs being extracted. So while Mimic might appear to be your standard creepy-crawly on steroids flick, it manages to be a little more than that in the end. Not much more mind you, the first half of the film was generally solid and genuinely unsettling at times, but the second half turned into a stock standard serial killer movie with multiple Buggy Kruegers. There was no more room for scuttling and looming menacingly, these techniques thrown out the window to be replaced by high pitched cockroach screams and full frontal assaults. Final Rating  5.5 / 10. I didn't mind Mimic, but after seeing what Guillermo Del Toro was able to do with Blade 2 (and subsequently Hellboy) I feel that greenlighting a creepy bug flick  and then deliberately diluting the creepiness  seems like an opportunity missed.

    A disease carried by common cockroaches is killing the children of Manhattan. In an effort to stop the epidemic an entomologist, Susan Tyler, creates a mutant breed of insect that secretes a fluid to kill the roaches. This mutant breed was engineered to die after one generation, but three years later Susan finds out that the species has survived and evolved into large monsters that can mimic human form...... After watching his movie, you will understand why Del Toro disowned it. The film has flashes of his brilliance, and at times, a wonderful creation is dying to get out, but then the Weinstein sheen takes over, and ruins the unique factor the movie had. No all Weinstein films have that sheen though, but you find more of their trademark 'editing' in smaller films like this, especially prolific directors who want to bring their genius to Hollywood. So what you are left with is a generic B-movie, with a beautiful Oscar winner in it, The Bad Guy from The Net, Diane Lanes Ex, and the brilliant Charles S. Dutton. The cast sounds good, but the material is dire. For the rest of the movie, we have kids selling bugs, the worst subways in the world, and a strange figure that spends half the film staring at people, and the other half attacking them, all in a really dark movie. The cast are better than this, and if Sorvino made better choices in 1997 rather than this and Romy and Michelle, she would be huge today. Shame really.

    Academy Award winners Mira Sorvino & F. Murray Abraham star in this thriller about an entomologist(Sorvino) who creates a mutant breed of insect to infect another breed of cockroaches that have been spreading a highly contagious disease decimating the children population. The disease is stopped, but three years later, a new problem emerges when that mutant breed(engineered to die off quickly) instead survive and thrive as large insects who can mimic human beings, and who must kill... There was much potential here for a compelling and exciting story, but somehow it feels squandered, as it becomes a standard "stalk & kill" picture with little viewer involvement in what happens, though it is well directed by Guillermo Del Toro, who apparently had creative control taken away from him, and it shows. Appealing actors cannot save it.

    Okay, to date I have seen about every full-length Guillermo Del Toro movie with the exception of The Devil's Backbone. As of now he is very easily one of my favourite directors. I found out that this was the only movie out of his that he didn't like (for a fact he disowned it). This made me think about sitting down and watching it. The plot of this movie is after a huge epidemic has broken out in New York, a doctor creates a new type of bug called The Judas breed to combat the carriers of the disease (cockroaches) designed only to last 6 months. Three years later she finds a baby Judas breed. As she, her husband, a cop and a shoe-shiner looking for his missing son (Who's connected) They find bugs that are just as big as human beings, and the bugs see them as prey. Overall it was a good movie. But it was sort of "meh" whereas I enjoyed movies like the Hellboy movies, Cronos, Blade 2 and Pan's Labyrinth a whole lot more. It is better than some horror movies of the 90's and it maybe worth a watch if you like horror (but watch Cronos instead). I won't really watch the sequels, mainly because this movie ends off with a closed enough plot line. I did like it but not as much as Del Toro's other work.

    You have to be into a certain type of movie to really be able to appreciate this. It's a sci fi-horror type movie; what was known back in the 50's as a "creature feature." If you liked those kinds of movies, then you'll like this one. Perhaps surprisingly for the genre, it has a pretty solid cast (folks like Mira Sorvino, Charles S. Dutton, F. Murray Abraham and Josh Brolin are all in this) and as far as I was concerned the cast (including the lesser known ones) all did a pretty good job. The direction from Guillermo del Toro was excellent. He built the story nicely, and he made excellent use of the setting of dark and abandoned subway tunnels deep under New York City, creating the totally appropriate atmosphere for this kind of film. The story opens with a mysterious disease having hit New York, and children dying in large numbers. The disease is spread by cockroaches, and a scientist (played by Sorvino) is able to develop genetically enhanced insects that successfully wipe out the roaches. The news bugs are supposed to be sterile, and with a life span of only about six months, but somehow, they manage to reproduce, and they grow to an enormous size, taking up residence in those abandoned tunnels. The story, of course, is about trying to find a way to now wipe these pests off the map before they start to wipe us off the planet! This is very well done. It's tense and suspenseful. There are times when you really wonder how any of those who go into the tunnels searching for the things are going to manage to get out. The darkness adds to a very appropriate creepiness. What else would you expect - it's about giant bugs! Somewhat to my own surprise, I actually really enjoyed this. (8/10)

    At first glance, the idea of mutant cockroaches being able to disguise themselves as humans may sound like the most ridiculous idea for a movie to ever be proposed. And, nine times out of ten, you would be right. Yet, what if I told you that, despite the ridiculousness of the idea, the story was turned into a good movie? 1997's "Mimic" is that movie. Directed by Guillermo del Toro, the film stars Mira Sorvino as Dr. Tyler, a young scientist who, in an attempt to save New York's children from a deadly pathogen carried by the common cockroach, creates a new species of insect that decimates the cockroach population and eliminates the disease. After this new species has done its work, the bugs are supposed to die off. However, three years later, people begin disappearing, strange, dark figures are walking the streets at night and from there, it doesn't take too long for the good doctor to figure out that her creation has evolved into a life of its own. A big reason for the film's success is the quality of acting that we have here; despite the fact that they're making a big bug movie, everyone involved gives it their all and as a result, we actually care about the characters. You have Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam as the doctor's love interest, Charles S. Dutton as a grumpy but likable subway cop, Giancarlo Giannini as a man who's son (Alexander Goodwin) has a strange bond with the creatures, and, in a small role, F. Murray Abraham as Dr. Tyler's mentor. But its not just the actors that make the movie work; a lot of the film's power to thrill is due to del Toro, who is able to create a dark mood for the movie by using the creepy tunnels and underbelly of New York by igniting our imagination. After all, how many of us have heard the urban legends of alligators, monster rats, and other assorted things dwelling in the sewers and tunnels of the city that never sleeps? Another element that deserves to be praised is the special effects that are used for the creatures themselves. When you see them, you will have no doubt that the characters are really being chased by these things. Also starring Josh Brolin, Alix Koromzay, and in an almost unrecognizable bit part as a sewer worker, Norman Reedus. To sum it all up, if monsters, dark tunnels, good acting, and good storytelling excite you, watch "Mimic".

    Eerie film with astonishing images , suspenseful and original direction by Guilermo Del Toro . Three years ago entomologist Dr. Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) genetically created an insect to kill cockroaches carrying a virulent disease . For thousands of years, man has been evolution's greatest creation , now the insects are out to destroy their only predator, mankind . Susan and Peter (Jeremy Northam) are called in to investigate. This heart-pounding picture is full of suspense ,thrills , mystery, lots of gore and a storm criticism to genetic engineering . This slick monster-feast is a triumph of style , well paced and full of frightening scenes . It's packed with overwhelming body count , loathing scenes , grotesque killing, and rivers of red blood . Interesting as well as thought-provoking screenplay by Matthew Robbins and the same director ,screenwriters Matt Greenberg and John Sayles are uncredited in the movie, but were credited in some of the trailers . The movie delivers the goods with hair-rising chills and noisy scares when the giant cockroaches appear savagely stalking and attacking its preys , including children . This is an OK amusing juvenile with interesting characters and scientific plot but quite entertaining . It's remarkable for FX recreation the ferocious and carnivorous beast developing a bloodthirsty hunger for human eating . The actors give vigorous physical performances dodging the giant bugs recreated by means of make-up realized by Rob Bottin , adding the prolific computer generator, as usual . The mutant cockroaches , themselves, of course, are the real stars, and they're marvellous terrifying astounding, and quite convincing .The picture is smartly designed and stylishly photographed by Dan Laustsen . Thrilling and intriguing musical score by Marco Beltrani . The motion picture was well directed by Guillermo Del Toro , though the scene where Mira Sorvino and Jeremy Northam walk in the hall with all the sick kids lying in their beds was actually directed by Ole Bornedal, one of the producers on the film . Del Toro delivers the terror movie goods with sense of style , though was originally planned as a single 30-min. short as part of a feature of sci-fi/horror/comedy shorts by Miramax. Director Guillermo del Toro disowned the film after constant clashes with Bob Weinstein, who would frequently visit the set and make unreasonable demands about what should be shot, deviating away from the script , since then del Toro has never worked with the Weinsteins. Guillermo is an expert on murky atmosphere such as proved in &uml;Cronos&uml; , &uml;Pan's labyrinth&uml;, &uml;Hellboy I&uml; and &uml;Hellboy 2&uml;. The picture will appeal to horror buffs and Guillermo Del Toro fans . It's followed by two sequels : Mimic 2 with Alix Koromzay , John Polito and Bruno Campos ; and Mimic 3 with Lance Henriksen and Karl Geary .

    First, there's no denying that the creepy crawly fly-y creatures are really really cool, with their human-like mimicking and their seeming transformation into big big bugs. The world of these bugs is cool too - dark and dank, wet and oozy, drippy and shadowy, whether it's below-ground or above-ground. Why is it always night-time? Why is it always raining? That's just part of the B movie fun. And this movie is fun. And scary. OK, it has holes, but what I loved about these holes (the bugs doing nonsensical things, and the bugs being wiped out in one silly swoop, for example) was, they gave the movie a fun cheesy feel, which added a campy element to it. Even so, or maybe in part because of this, the movie is really good. You gotta have those campy false alarm, music building, heart racing, oh good, everybody is OK...for now... scenes. Doesn't mean they'll be OK next time! Mira Sorvino is out to lunch in this movie, as if she had something else on her mind all the time. But what would a good B movie be without some bad acting? But her bad acting is countered by the wonderful Charles S. Dutton as Leonard the transit policeman, who is just so good in that role. He is the star of every scene he's in. With his blues singing and liberal use of the S word, he provides an excellent comic foil to the horror. But he isn't intentionally doing comedy...he just has a great personality, especially in the face of doom. I had a good time watching Mimic, and you should too.

In an effort to stop the epidemic an entomologist, Susan Tyler, creates a mutant breed of insect that secretes a fluid to kill the roaches. This mutant breed was engineered to die after one generation, but three years later Susan finds out that the species has survived and evolved into large monsters that can mimic human form...... After watching his movie, you will understand why Del Toro disowned it. The film has flashes of his brilliance, and at times, a wonderful creation is dying to get out, but then the Weinstein sheen takes over, and ruins the unique factor the movie had. No all Weinstein films have that sheen though, but you find more of their trademark 'editing' in smaller films like this, especially prolific directors who want to bring their genius to Hollywood. So what you are left with is a generic B-movie, with a beautiful Oscar winner in it, The Bad Guy from The Net, Diane Lanes Ex, and the brilliant Charles S. Dutton. The cast sounds good, but the material is dire. For the rest of the movie, we have kids selling bugs, the worst subways in the world, and a strange figure that spends half the film staring at people, and the other half attacking them, all in a really dark movie. The cast are better than this, and if Sorvino made better choices in 1997 rather than this and Romy and Michelle, she would be huge today. Shame really.

    Academy Award winners Mira Sorvino & F. Murray Abraham star in this thriller about an entomologist(Sorvino) who creates a mutant breed of insect to infect another breed of cockroaches that have been spreading a highly contagious disease decimating the children population. The disease is stopped, but three years later, a new problem emerges when that mutant breed(engineered to die off quickly) instead survive and thrive as large insects who can mimic human beings, and who must kill... There was much potential here for a compelling and exciting story, but somehow it feels squandered, as it becomes a standard "stalk & kill" picture with little viewer involvement in what happens, though it is well directed by Guillermo Del Toro, who apparently had creative control taken away from him, and it shows. Appealing actors cannot save it.

    Okay, to date I have seen about every full-length Guillermo Del Toro movie with the exception of The Devil's Backbone. As of now he is very easily one of my favourite directors. I found out that this was the only movie out of his that he didn't like (for a fact he disowned it). This made me think about sitting down and watching it. The plot of this movie is after a huge epidemic has broken out in New York, a doctor creates a new type of bug called The Judas breed to combat the carriers of the disease (cockroaches) designed only to last 6 months. Three years later she finds a baby Judas breed. As she, her husband, a cop and a shoe-shiner looking for his missing son (Who's connected) They find bugs that are just as big as human beings, and the bugs see them as prey. Overall it was a good movie. But it was sort of "meh" whereas I enjoyed movies like the Hellboy movies, Cronos, Blade 2 and Pan's Labyrinth a whole lot more. It is better than some horror movies of the 90's and it maybe worth a watch if you like horror (but watch Cronos instead). I won't really watch the sequels, mainly because this movie ends off with a closed enough plot line. I did like it but not as much as Del Toro's other work.

    You have to be into a certain type of movie to really be able to appreciate this. It's a sci fi-horror type movie; what was known back in the 50's as a "creature feature." If you liked those kinds of movies, then you'll like this one. Perhaps surprisingly for the genre, it has a pretty solid cast (folks like Mira Sorvino, Charles S. Dutton, F. Murray Abraham and Josh Brolin are all in this) and as far as I was concerned the cast (including the lesser known ones) all did a pretty good job. The direction from Guillermo del Toro was excellent. He built the story nicely, and he made excellent use of the setting of dark and abandoned subway tunnels deep under New York City, creating the totally appropriate atmosphere for this kind of film. The story opens with a mysterious disease having hit New York, and children dying in large numbers. The disease is spread by cockroaches, and a scientist (played by Sorvino) is able to develop genetically enhanced insects that successfully wipe out the roaches. The news bugs are supposed to be sterile, and with a life span of only about six months, but somehow, they manage to reproduce, and they grow to an enormous size, taking up residence in those abandoned tunnels. The story, of course, is about trying to find a way to now wipe these pests off the map before they start to wipe us off the planet! This is very well done. It's tense and suspenseful. There are times when you really wonder how any of those who go into the tunnels searching for the things are going to manage to get out. The darkness adds to a very appropriate creepiness. What else would you expect - it's about giant bugs! Somewhat to my own surprise, I actually really enjoyed this. (8/10)

    At first glance, the idea of mutant cockroaches being able to disguise themselves as humans may sound like the most ridiculous idea for a movie to ever be proposed. And, nine times out of ten, you would be right. Yet, what if I told you that, despite the ridiculousness of the idea, the story was turned into a good movie? 1997's "Mimic" is that movie. Directed by Guillermo del Toro, the film stars Mira Sorvino as Dr. Tyler, a young scientist who, in an attempt to save New York's children from a deadly pathogen carried by the common cockroach, creates a new species of insect that decimates the cockroach population and eliminates the disease. After this new species has done its work, the bugs are supposed to die off. However, three years later, people begin disappearing, strange, dark figures are walking the streets at night and from there, it doesn't take too long for the good doctor to figure out that her creation has evolved into a life of its own. A big reason for the film's success is the quality of acting that we have here; despite the fact that they're making a big bug movie, everyone involved gives it their all and as a result, we actually care about the characters. You have Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam as the doctor's love interest, Charles S. Dutton as a grumpy but likable subway cop, Giancarlo Giannini as a man who's son (Alexander Goodwin) has a strange bond with the creatures, and, in a small role, F. Murray Abraham as Dr. Tyler's mentor. But its not just the actors that make the movie work; a lot of the film's power to thrill is due to del Toro, who is able to create a dark mood for the movie by using the creepy tunnels and underbelly of New York by igniting our imagination. After all, how many of us have heard the urban legends of alligators, monster rats, and other assorted things dwelling in the sewers and tunnels of the city that never sleeps? Another element that deserves to be praised is the special effects that are used for the creatures themselves. When you see them, you will have no doubt that the characters are really being chased by these things. Also starring Josh Brolin, Alix Koromzay, and in an almost unrecognizable bit part as a sewer worker, Norman Reedus. To sum it all up, if monsters, dark tunnels, good acting, and good storytelling excite you, watch "Mimic".

    Eerie film with astonishing images , suspenseful and original direction by Guilermo Del Toro . Three years ago entomologist Dr. Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) genetically created an insect to kill cockroaches carrying a virulent disease . For thousands of years, man has been evolution's greatest creation , now the insects are out to destroy their only predator, mankind . Susan and Peter (Jeremy Northam) are called in to investigate. This heart-pounding picture is full of suspense ,thrills , mystery, lots of gore and a storm criticism to genetic engineering . This slick monster-feast is a triumph of style , well paced and full of frightening scenes . It's packed with overwhelming body count , loathing scenes , grotesque killing, and rivers of red blood . Interesting as well as thought-provoking screenplay by Matthew Robbins and the same director ,screenwriters Matt Greenberg and John Sayles are uncredited in the movie, but were credited in some of the trailers . The movie delivers the goods with hair-rising chills and noisy scares when the giant cockroaches appear savagely stalking and attacking its preys , including children . This is an OK amusing juvenile with interesting characters and scientific plot but quite entertaining . It's remarkable for FX recreation the ferocious and carnivorous beast developing a bloodthirsty hunger for human eating . The actors give vigorous physical performances dodging the giant bugs recreated by means of make-up realized by Rob Bottin , adding the prolific computer generator, as usual . The mutant cockroaches , themselves, of course, are the real stars, and they're marvellous terrifying astounding, and quite convincing .The picture is smartly designed and stylishly photographed by Dan Laustsen . Thrilling and intriguing musical score by Marco Beltrani . The motion picture was well directed by Guillermo Del Toro , though the scene where Mira Sorvino and Jeremy Northam walk in the hall with all the sick kids lying in their beds was actually directed by Ole Bornedal, one of the producers on the film . Del Toro delivers the terror movie goods with sense of style , though was originally planned as a single 30-min. short as part of a feature of sci-fi/horror/comedy shorts by Miramax. Director Guillermo del Toro disowned the film after constant clashes with Bob Weinstein, who would frequently visit the set and make unreasonable demands about what should be shot, deviating away from the script , since then del Toro has never worked with the Weinsteins. Guillermo is an expert on murky atmosphere such as proved in &uml;Cronos&uml; , &uml;Pan's labyrinth&uml;, &uml;Hellboy I&uml; and &uml;Hellboy 2&uml;. The picture will appeal to horror buffs and Guillermo Del Toro fans . It's followed by two sequels : Mimic 2 with Alix Koromzay , John Polito and Bruno Campos ; and Mimic 3 with Lance Henriksen and Karl Geary .

    First, there's no denying that the creepy crawly fly-y creatures are really really cool, with their human-like mimicking and their seeming transformation into big big bugs. The world of these bugs is cool too - dark and dank, wet and oozy, drippy and shadowy, whether it's below-ground or above-ground. Why is it always night-time? Why is it always raining? That's just part of the B movie fun. And this movie is fun. And scary. OK, it has holes, but what I loved about these holes (the bugs doing nonsensical things, and the bugs being wiped out in one silly swoop, for example) was, they gave the movie a fun cheesy feel, which added a campy element to it. Even so, or maybe in part because of this, the movie is really good. You gotta have those campy false alarm, music building, heart racing, oh good, everybody is OK...for now... scenes. Doesn't mean they'll be OK next time! Mira Sorvino is out to lunch in this movie, as if she had something else on her mind all the time. But what would a good B movie be without some bad acting? But her bad acting is countered by the wonderful Charles S. Dutton as Leonard the transit policeman, who is just so good in that role. He is the star of every scene he's in. With his blues singing and liberal use of the S word, he provides an excellent comic foil to the horror. But he isn't intentionally doing comedy...he just has a great personality, especially in the face of doom. I had a good time watching Mimic, and you should too.

    I can't believe this movie has a 5.8 while the likes of something as sh*tty as "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" has a 6.7. For God's sake the first Quarantine has around a 6.0, and I'd rather stick a hot needle in my eye till it sizzled and popped (curtsey of "Under Siege 2") then go thru the grueling experience of watching that film again. This film is under the helm of Guillermo del Toro, and it has a number of merits going for it. While the story may be one we have seen before, the characters he fills it with are far from bland. Mira Sorvino is sexy as well as great lead female, Jeremy Northam is also very good and Charles S. Dutton is great. Also, Josh Brolin is very good in it, kind of an asshole, but good. And if you're a real del Toro fan, keep your eyes out for a cameo of Norman Reedus and Doug Jones. Another thing that separates this film from the bunch is incredible production design. Compared to the dull sets seen in "Quarantine", this film speaks volumes about the decay of mankind. Dingy, disgusting, dark, and decrepit, and that's just the d's that describe the awesome look of the film. And complimenting this is one of the maestro Marco Beltrami's master scores. Nice use of the eerie chorus adds greatly to many scenes. Where was "Quarantine" (s) score? Oh I forgot it was trying so hard to be 'realistic'. Thing is both films do have more or less seen before plots, but "Mimic" excels because it is so much more artistic at it. At the base of entertainment, film is still rooted in being an art form, and so hold "Mimic" to be in high caliber compared to the sh*tfest of most horror films today.

    I remember vividly going to see Mimic upon its release back on July 2nd 1998. It barely got into UK cinemas, and was dumped in the tiny Screen 5 at the old Odeon cinema in Edinburgh for all of one week before disappearing. They'd never do that to a Guillermo Del Toro film now that he's a popular director. But even back then his trademark imagery of insects, muck, and oppressive weather were thick throughout the movie. A strange virus carried by cockroaches is killing-off New York's kids until Entomologist (insect scientist) Susan Tyler (the tall, gorgeous, big-boobed Academy Award-winning Miro Sorvino, who just...vanished) and her boyfriend Peter Mann (Clive Owen's twin brother Jeremy Northam) create a new breed of cockroach to kill them off. With the children safe they all breath a sigh of relief. Then three years pass, with something sinister brewing beneath the city streets. People start to go missing in the subways, strange new insects are emerging from the grimy darkness, and what appears to be a man in a long coat is always watching from the gloomy corners. Del Toro's vision for the film was compromised by the interference of Harvey Weinstein, who foolishly contradicted his judgment (this being the same guy who greenlit Grindhouse!). The resulting movie was disowned by Del Toro, which is a shame since you can really see the potential behind it. The planned ending for hundreds of Mimics standing around in Time Square station would have been amazing, and a natural follow-on to the plot that precedes it. Instead the ending is rather lame, and the threat of the Mimics migrating through the tunnels and possibly taking over the world is ignored as soon as it's mentioned. A huge missed opportunity there. What a bleak, apocalyptic ending that would have been. The so-called Director's Cut (the best parts of the script were never actually filmed) restores some minor plot points and gives us alternate dialogue. The biggest addition is the fact that Miro Sorvino's character is pregnant, but it adds NOTHING to the story, and feels rudely tacked-on. A great example of a movie that good have been if only the producers had a clue what they were doing. For what it is...there are some decent moments to be had.

    The initial outbreak of Strickler's disease erupted suddenly. As a disease that preyed on young children it had a massive huge impact and fear spread quickly through the parents and grandparents of New York City. There were many casualties, with a greater number of children being adversely impacted for the rest of their lives. That was until entomologist  bug doctor  Dr Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) unleashed the Judas breed of genetically modified cockroaches into the grimy New York ecosystem. This supercharged bug exuded a goo that was like crack for the Strickler's spreading normal cockroaches, wiping out the entire disease carrying generation and saving countless young lives in the process. And that's just the first 6 minutes of Guillermo Del Toro's 90s thriller Mimic, 10% of one hour which I might add also managed to include the main title credits. However you look at it this was classic GDT, set the scene as quickly as possible before getting to the real scares, fluids, vivid images and various other oozings. (He managed an even better job with Blade 2, recapping the previous film, key characters and setting the tone in a similar length of time. Brevity and conciseness are two very underrated qualities that GDT has in spades.) The ensuing years were a little less hectic for Dr Tyler. Having found her hubbie Dr Peter Mann in the research process for the Judas breed the newly married couple settle down to married existence and more mundane bug analysis. That is until she recognizes some of the same traits of the Judas bug in some samples brought to her by some young local kids. This is exceptionally strange given that the genetically modded bugs were purpose built with 6 month expiry dates and were supposed to be incapable of breeding. Unfortunately despite the fact that they shouldn't even exist two years later there is even more troubling news. The bugs are now over 6 feet tall, vicious, apparently mad with power, and hungry. Initially it seems that the hunger was sated primarily with stray dogs, but there are only so many dogs in the NYC a lot of people though. In the early goings the only person to see the creatures was an 11 year old autistic boy who played the spoons and had a shoe fetish  I told you it was a Del Toro film  this despite the fact that they brazenly walked the alleys and subway tunnels by night, because being six foot tall and buggy sometimes isn't enough. But once Susan, Peter and a couple of cops Josh and Leonard (Josh Brolin and Charles S. Dutton) all find themselves deep under the subway system with an army of nasty bugs in pursuit and without a 6 foot tall can of Mortein, any semblance of tension and care vanishes, and the remainder of the film becomes a grab bag of scenes ripped from other films more deserving of science fiction classic status, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator among them. Apparently GDT started the film on his terms but found that his vision and style was swiftly diluted by an ever increasing army of studio staff all hell bent on crafting a generic Hollywood B movie  with the B standing for Boring, Banal, Bugs. Sure the signs are still there, I've spoken of the intro already, but a couple of other early scenes unwind menacingly, and he manages the near obligatory autopsy sequence filled with goo and disgusting organs being extracted. So while Mimic might appear to be your standard creepy-crawly on steroids flick, it manages to be a little more than that in the end. Not much more mind you, the first half of the film was generally solid and genuinely unsettling at times, but the second half turned into a stock standard serial killer movie with multiple Buggy Kruegers. There was no more room for scuttling and looming menacingly, these techniques thrown out the window to be replaced by high pitched cockroach screams and full frontal assaults. Final Rating  5.5 / 10. I didn't mind Mimic, but after seeing what Guillermo Del Toro was able to do with Blade 2 (and subsequently Hellboy) I feel that greenlighting a creepy bug flick  and then deliberately diluting the creepiness  seems like an opportunity missed.

    First, there's no denying that the creepy crawly fly-y creatures are really really cool, with their human-like mimicking and their seeming transformation into big big bugs. The world of these bugs is cool too - dark and dank, wet and oozy, drippy and shadowy, whether it's below-ground or above-ground. Why is it always night-time? Why is it always raining? That's just part of the B movie fun. And this movie is fun. And scary. OK, it has holes, but what I loved about these holes (the bugs doing nonsensical things, and the bugs being wiped out in one silly swoop, for example) was, they gave the movie a fun cheesy feel, which added a campy element to it. Even so, or maybe in part because of this, the movie is really good. You gotta have those campy false alarm, music building, heart racing, oh good, everybody is OK...for now... scenes. Doesn't mean they'll be OK next time! Mira Sorvino is out to lunch in this movie, as if she had something else on her mind all the time. But what would a good B movie be without some bad acting? But her bad acting is countered by the wonderful Charles S. Dutton as Leonard the transit policeman, who is just so good in that role. He is the star of every scene he's in. With his blues singing and liberal use of the S word, he provides an excellent comic foil to the horror. But he isn't intentionally doing comedy...he just has a great personality, especially in the face of doom. I had a good time watching Mimic, and you should too.

    I can't believe this movie has a 5.8 while the likes of something as sh*tty as "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" has a 6.7. For God's sake the first Quarantine has around a 6.0, and I'd rather stick a hot needle in my eye till it sizzled and popped (curtsey of "Under Siege 2") then go thru the grueling experience of watching that film again. This film is under the helm of Guillermo del Toro, and it has a number of merits going for it. While the story may be one we have seen before, the characters he fills it with are far from bland. Mira Sorvino is sexy as well as great lead female, Jeremy Northam is also very good and Charles S. Dutton is great. Also, Josh Brolin is very good in it, kind of an asshole, but good. And if you're a real del Toro fan, keep your eyes out for a cameo of Norman Reedus and Doug Jones. Another thing that separates this film from the bunch is incredible production design. Compared to the dull sets seen in "Quarantine", this film speaks volumes about the decay of mankind. Dingy, disgusting, dark, and decrepit, and that's just the d's that describe the awesome look of the film. And complimenting this is one of the maestro Marco Beltrami's master scores. Nice use of the eerie chorus adds greatly to many scenes. Where was "Quarantine" (s) score? Oh I forgot it was trying so hard to be 'realistic'. Thing is both films do have more or less seen before plots, but "Mimic" excels because it is so much more artistic at it. At the base of entertainment, film is still rooted in being an art form, and so hold "Mimic" to be in high caliber compared to the sh*tfest of most horror films today.

    I remember vividly going to see Mimic upon its release back on July 2nd 1998. It barely got into UK cinemas, and was dumped in the tiny Screen 5 at the old Odeon cinema in Edinburgh for all of one week before disappearing. They'd never do that to a Guillermo Del Toro film now that he's a popular director. But even back then his trademark imagery of insects, muck, and oppressive weather were thick throughout the movie. A strange virus carried by cockroaches is killing-off New York's kids until Entomologist (insect scientist) Susan Tyler (the tall, gorgeous, big-boobed Academy Award-winning Miro Sorvino, who just...vanished) and her boyfriend Peter Mann (Clive Owen's twin brother Jeremy Northam) create a new breed of cockroach to kill them off. With the children safe they all breath a sigh of relief. Then three years pass, with something sinister brewing beneath the city streets. People start to go missing in the subways, strange new insects are emerging from the grimy darkness, and what appears to be a man in a long coat is always watching from the gloomy corners. Del Toro's vision for the film was compromised by the interference of Harvey Weinstein, who foolishly contradicted his judgment (this being the same guy who greenlit Grindhouse!). The resulting movie was disowned by Del Toro, which is a shame since you can really see the potential behind it. The planned ending for hundreds of Mimics standing around in Time Square station would have been amazing, and a natural follow-on to the plot that precedes it. Instead the ending is rather lame, and the threat of the Mimics migrating through the tunnels and possibly taking over the world is ignored as soon as it's mentioned. A huge missed opportunity there. What a bleak, apocalyptic ending that would have been. The so-called Director's Cut (the best parts of the script were never actually filmed) restores some minor plot points and gives us alternate dialogue. The biggest addition is the fact that Miro Sorvino's character is pregnant, but it adds NOTHING to the story, and feels rudely tacked-on. A great example of a movie that good have been if only the producers had a clue what they were doing. For what it is...there are some decent moments to be had.

    The initial outbreak of Strickler's disease erupted suddenly. As a disease that preyed on young children it had a massive huge impact and fear spread quickly through the parents and grandparents of New York City. There were many casualties, with a greater number of children being adversely impacted for the rest of their lives. That was until entomologist  bug doctor  Dr Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) unleashed the Judas breed of genetically modified cockroaches into the grimy New York ecosystem. This supercharged bug exuded a goo that was like crack for the Strickler's spreading normal cockroaches, wiping out the entire disease carrying generation and saving countless young lives in the process. And that's just the first 6 minutes of Guillermo Del Toro's 90s thriller Mimic, 10% of one hour which I might add also managed to include the main title credits. However you look at it this was classic GDT, set the scene as quickly as possible before getting to the real scares, fluids, vivid images and various other oozings. (He managed an even better job with Blade 2, recapping the previous film, key characters and setting the tone in a similar length of time. Brevity and conciseness are two very underrated qualities that GDT has in spades.) The ensuing years were a little less hectic for Dr Tyler. Having found her hubbie Dr Peter Mann in the research process for the Judas breed the newly married couple settle down to married existence and more mundane bug analysis. That is until she recognizes some of the same traits of the Judas bug in some samples brought to her by some young local kids. This is exceptionally strange given that the genetically modded bugs were purpose built with 6 month expiry dates and were supposed to be incapable of breeding. Unfortunately despite the fact that they shouldn't even exist two years later there is even more troubling news. The bugs are now over 6 feet tall, vicious, apparently mad with power, and hungry. Initially it seems that the hunger was sated primarily with stray dogs, but there are only so many dogs in the NYC a lot of people though. In the early goings the only person to see the creatures was an 11 year old autistic boy who played the spoons and had a shoe fetish  I told you it was a Del Toro film  this despite the fact that they brazenly walked the alleys and subway tunnels by night, because being six foot tall and buggy sometimes isn't enough. But once Susan, Peter and a couple of cops Josh and Leonard (Josh Brolin and Charles S. Dutton) all find themselves deep under the subway system with an army of nasty bugs in pursuit and without a 6 foot tall can of Mortein, any semblance of tension and care vanishes, and the remainder of the film becomes a grab bag of scenes ripped from other films more deserving of science fiction classic status, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator among them. Apparently GDT started the film on his terms but found that his vision and style was swiftly diluted by an ever increasing army of studio staff all hell bent on crafting a generic Hollywood B movie  with the B standing for Boring, Banal, Bugs. Sure the signs are still there, I've spoken of the intro already, but a couple of other early scenes unwind menacingly, and he manages the near obligatory autopsy sequence filled with goo and disgusting organs being extracted. So while Mimic might appear to be your standard creepy-crawly on steroids flick, it manages to be a little more than that in the end. Not much more mind you, the first half of the film was generally solid and genuinely unsettling at times, but the second half turned into a stock standard serial killer movie with multiple Buggy Kruegers. There was no more room for scuttling and looming menacingly, these techniques thrown out the window to be replaced by high pitched cockroach screams and full frontal assaults. Final Rating  5.5 / 10. I didn't mind Mimic, but after seeing what Guillermo Del Toro was able to do with Blade 2 (and subsequently Hellboy) I feel that greenlighting a creepy bug flick  and then deliberately diluting the creepiness  seems like an opportunity missed.

    A disease carried by common cockroaches is killing the children of Manhattan. In an effort to stop the epidemic an entomologist, Susan Tyler, creates a mutant breed of insect that secretes a fluid to kill the roaches. This mutant breed was engineered to die after one generation, but three years later Susan finds out that the species has survived and evolved into large monsters that can mimic human form...... After watching his movie, you will understand why Del Toro disowned it. The film has flashes of his brilliance, and at times, a wonderful creation is dying to get out, but then the Weinstein sheen takes over, and ruins the unique factor the movie had. No all Weinstein films have that sheen though, but you find more of their trademark 'editing' in smaller films like this, especially prolific directors who want to bring their genius to Hollywood. So what you are left with is a generic B-movie, with a beautiful Oscar winner in it, The Bad Guy from The Net, Diane Lanes Ex, and the brilliant Charles S. Dutton. The cast sounds good, but the material is dire. For the rest of the movie, we have kids selling bugs, the worst subways in the world, and a strange figure that spends half the film staring at people, and the other half attacking them, all in a really dark movie. The cast are better than this, and if Sorvino made better choices in 1997 rather than this and Romy and Michelle, she would be huge today. Shame really.

    Academy Award winners Mira Sorvino & F. Murray Abraham star in this thriller about an entomologist(Sorvino) who creates a mutant breed of insect to infect another breed of cockroaches that have been spreading a highly contagious disease decimating the children population. The disease is stopped, but three years later, a new problem emerges when that mutant breed(engineered to die off quickly) instead survive and thrive as large insects who can mimic human beings, and who must kill... There was much potential here for a compelling and exciting story, but somehow it feels squandered, as it becomes a standard "stalk & kill" picture with little viewer involvement in what happens, though it is well directed by Guillermo Del Toro, who apparently had creative control taken away from him, and it shows. Appealing actors cannot save it.

    Okay, to date I have seen about every full-length Guillermo Del Toro movie with the exception of The Devil's Backbone. As of now he is very easily one of my favourite directors. I found out that this was the only movie out of his that he didn't like (for a fact he disowned it). This made me think about sitting down and watching it. The plot of this movie is after a huge epidemic has broken out in New York, a doctor creates a new type of bug called The Judas breed to combat the carriers of the disease (cockroaches) designed only to last 6 months. Three years later she finds a baby Judas breed. As she, her husband, a cop and a shoe-shiner looking for his missing son (Who's connected) They find bugs that are just as big as human beings, and the bugs see them as prey. Overall it was a good movie. But it was sort of "meh" whereas I enjoyed movies like the Hellboy movies, Cronos, Blade 2 and Pan's Labyrinth a whole lot more. It is better than some horror movies of the 90's and it maybe worth a watch if you like horror (but watch Cronos instead). I won't really watch the sequels, mainly because this movie ends off with a closed enough plot line. I did like it but not as much as Del Toro's other work.

    You have to be into a certain type of movie to really be able to appreciate this. It's a sci fi-horror type movie; what was known back in the 50's as a "creature feature." If you liked those kinds of movies, then you'll like this one. Perhaps surprisingly for the genre, it has a pretty solid cast (folks like Mira Sorvino, Charles S. Dutton, F. Murray Abraham and Josh Brolin are all in this) and as far as I was concerned the cast (including the lesser known ones) all did a pretty good job. The direction from Guillermo del Toro was excellent. He built the story nicely, and he made excellent use of the setting of dark and abandoned subway tunnels deep under New York City, creating the totally appropriate atmosphere for this kind of film. The story opens with a mysterious disease having hit New York, and children dying in large numbers. The disease is spread by cockroaches, and a scientist (played by Sorvino) is able to develop genetically enhanced insects that successfully wipe out the roaches. The news bugs are supposed to be sterile, and with a life span of only about six months, but somehow, they manage to reproduce, and they grow to an enormous size, taking up residence in those abandoned tunnels. The story, of course, is about trying to find a way to now wipe these pests off the map before they start to wipe us off the planet! This is very well done. It's tense and suspenseful. There are times when you really wonder how any of those who go into the tunnels searching for the things are going to manage to get out. The darkness adds to a very appropriate creepiness. What else would you expect - it's about giant bugs! Somewhat to my own surprise, I actually really enjoyed this. (8/10)

    At first glance, the idea of mutant cockroaches being able to disguise themselves as humans may sound like the most ridiculous idea for a movie to ever be proposed. And, nine times out of ten, you would be right. Yet, what if I told you that, despite the ridiculousness of the idea, the story was turned into a good movie? 1997's "Mimic" is that movie. Directed by Guillermo del Toro, the film stars Mira Sorvino as Dr. Tyler, a young scientist who, in an attempt to save New York's children from a deadly pathogen carried by the common cockroach, creates a new species of insect that decimates the cockroach population and eliminates the disease. After this new species has done its work, the bugs are supposed to die off. However, three years later, people begin disappearing, strange, dark figures are walking the streets at night and from there, it doesn't take too long for the good doctor to figure out that her creation has evolved into a life of its own. A big reason for the film's success is the quality of acting that we have here; despite the fact that they're making a big bug movie, everyone involved gives it their all and as a result, we actually care about the characters. You have Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam as the doctor's love interest, Charles S. Dutton as a grumpy but likable subway cop, Giancarlo Giannini as a man who's son (Alexander Goodwin) has a strange bond with the creatures, and, in a small role, F. Murray Abraham as Dr. Tyler's mentor. But its not just the actors that make the movie work; a lot of the film's power to thrill is due to del Toro, who is able to create a dark mood for the movie by using the creepy tunnels and underbelly of New York by igniting our imagination. After all, how many of us have heard the urban legends of alligators, monster rats, and other assorted things dwelling in the sewers and tunnels of the city that never sleeps? Another element that deserves to be praised is the special effects that are used for the creatures themselves. When you see them, you will have no doubt that the characters are really being chased by these things. Also starring Josh Brolin, Alix Koromzay, and in an almost unrecognizable bit part as a sewer worker, Norman Reedus. To sum it all up, if monsters, dark tunnels, good acting, and good storytelling excite you, watch "Mimic".

However you look at it this was classic GDT, set the scene as quickly as possible before getting to the real scares, fluids, vivid images and various other oozings. (He managed an even better job with Blade 2, recapping the previous film, key characters and setting the tone in a similar length of time. Brevity and conciseness are two very underrated qualities that GDT has in spades.) The ensuing years were a little less hectic for Dr Tyler. Having found her hubbie Dr Peter Mann in the research process for the Judas breed the newly married couple settle down to married existence and more mundane bug analysis. That is until she recognizes some of the same traits of the Judas bug in some samples brought to her by some young local kids. This is exceptionally strange given that the genetically modded bugs were purpose built with 6 month expiry dates and were supposed to be incapable of breeding. Unfortunately despite the fact that they shouldn't even exist two years later there is even more troubling news. The bugs are now over 6 feet tall, vicious, apparently mad with power, and hungry. Initially it seems that the hunger was sated primarily with stray dogs, but there are only so many dogs in the NYC a lot of people though. In the early goings the only person to see the creatures was an 11 year old autistic boy who played the spoons and had a shoe fetish  I told you it was a Del Toro film  this despite the fact that they brazenly walked the alleys and subway tunnels by night, because being six foot tall and buggy sometimes isn't enough. But once Susan, Peter and a couple of cops Josh and Leonard (Josh Brolin and Charles S. Dutton) all find themselves deep under the subway system with an army of nasty bugs in pursuit and without a 6 foot tall can of Mortein, any semblance of tension and care vanishes, and the remainder of the film becomes a grab bag of scenes ripped from other films more deserving of science fiction classic status, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator among them. Apparently GDT started the film on his terms but found that his vision and style was swiftly diluted by an ever increasing army of studio staff all hell bent on crafting a generic Hollywood B movie  with the B standing for Boring, Banal, Bugs. Sure the signs are still there, I've spoken of the intro already, but a couple of other early scenes unwind menacingly, and he manages the near obligatory autopsy sequence filled with goo and disgusting organs being extracted. So while Mimic might appear to be your standard creepy-crawly on steroids flick, it manages to be a little more than that in the end. Not much more mind you, the first half of the film was generally solid and genuinely unsettling at times, but the second half turned into a stock standard serial killer movie with multiple Buggy Kruegers. There was no more room for scuttling and looming menacingly, these techniques thrown out the window to be replaced by high pitched cockroach screams and full frontal assaults. Final Rating  5.5 / 10. I didn't mind Mimic, but after seeing what Guillermo Del Toro was able to do with Blade 2 (and subsequently Hellboy) I feel that greenlighting a creepy bug flick  and then deliberately diluting the creepiness  seems like an opportunity missed.
