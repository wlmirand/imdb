    Death machine is a science fiction film that came out in 1994. The movie takes place in 2023 in a cyberpunk type future that Blade Runner paved the way for. The story follows Hayden Cale, played by Ely Pouget, who is the CEO of Chaank Industries. Chaank Industries is secretly developing a death machine that can track its victims through fear. The creator of the machine is Jack Dante played by Brad Dourif. Hayden finds this out and tries to stop Dante, but he releases the machine to kill her and a group of stragglers. Together, they must destroy the creature and bring the secret to light. Overall I thought the film was okay, but there are a lot of problems with it. Firstly most of the characters I thought were very bland. The lead girl, Hayden, tries to be the Ripley of this film, but I do not think she pulls it off. I found her to be uninteresting as a character. The same with the other main characters. I was not invested in their characters, so I did not care if they lived or died. The one character I thought was a lot of fun is Brad Dourif's character Dante. He is so over-the-top that I just found him very enjoyable to watch. The acting is a mixed bag. The main cast did okay, but the supporting cast was horrible. For example, there was this random cop that appeared periodically in the film. The guy that played the cop is a terrible actor. He did not deliver one line naturally. Brad Dourif was the most over-the-top in the film acting wise. However, again he is so goofy that it is hard not to enjoy him. Dourif is easily one of the best aspects about this film. The effects are meh, in my opinion. The wide shot of the city looked good. The style reminded me a lot of Blade Runner. However, many of the other effects looked off. For example, the effects of the death machine when it is moving are laughable. The design of the machine itself is also very lackluster, in my opinion. Many elements of this film remind me of other Sci-Fi films like Blade Runner, Terminator, Alien, etc. However, those elements just made me think about how much better those movies are and how those elements are handled better in those films. Overall this is an okay film, but there are many better Sci-Fi films out there. If you are a fan of Bred Dourif, then I'd say give this a look.

    "Death Machine" was actually a nice surprise of a movie. Sure it is a spoof on movies such a "Robocop", "Aliens", "Terminator", "Die Hard" and movies in that caliber, but it was so much fun to watch. The story in "Death Machine" is about Jack Dante who works at a big corporation, who unleash a killing machine that he has been working on in secret after he becomes fired from his job. And it is up to a small group of people to stand up to this ultimate killer and stop it before it kills them. "Death Machine" was loads of fun to watch because it was so cheesy and campy. However, they had lots of nice stuff in the movie, lots of nice details and actually had decent enough props, sets and outfits. What I loved the most, personally, was the armored robotic suit that they put the guy in; in lots of scenes you could see it was just plastic covered foam he was wearing, as it was creasing and wrinkling as he bent and moved around. It was hilarious. Take a look at the names of the people in the movie; John Carpenter, Weyland, Yutani, Scott Ridley, etc. that was just amusing. Lots of fun references here, and if you are an avid movie-watcher, then you are bound to pick up on lots of hints and references here, there and everywhere. For a movie of this type, they had actually managed to put together a great cast ensemble, lots of faces that will be familiar to you if you watch a good deal of movies. It should be said, that the movie was being carried by Brad Dourif who played Jack Dante. "Death Machine" has a lot of action and actually have a good amount of entertainment value. I was surprised at the movie, as I had expected it to be a very, very low budget Sci-Fi movie. I was thoroughly entertained by the movie and must say that it was actually a great homage to various movies over the years. If you haven't seen "Death Machine" yet, get to it. Watch it for the cheesy movie that it is. Don't take it too serious. Watch it for all the references to other movies (if you are a movie fanatic). Watch it for the foamy body armor-suit. Watch it for the sheer fun that it is. Just watch it.

    Attractive but dim exec (Ely Pouget) has to fight against a fruitcake mad scientist/ computer genius (Brad Dourif) who has just built "death machine", a nine-foot-tall, fanged robotic creature which senses fear, and goes chomping through the high tech HQ after its creator is fired. A trio of cyberpunk computer hackers breaks into the building the same night "death machine" is unleashed, and end up running for their lives and fighting it also, and also to give the film a higher body count and a couple more plot complications. Robotic "death machine" creature looks effective, and its fall from the side of the building was done fairly well, but it takes too long for it to be introduced into the plot, and after it is,it disappears for too much time to really keep the momentum going all the way through, which keeps this cyberpunk slasher from being as much fun as it might have been. As it is, this ends up constantly veering from "so-bad-it's-good" to lame Die Hard ripoff. And speaking of lame, about that ending..... **1/2 out of ****

    Yeah, yeah, it's low-budget, but as someone else pointed out, the movie at least knows what it is and delivers it pretty well. I won't waste your time rewriting the plot synopsis, as you can read that above and below in the previous reviews. What I WILL say is that there is a significant difference between the 99 minute cut out on DVD and the 128 minute cut that is only available on a long OOP Japanese laserdisc and a long OOP German DVD (which looks fantastic, but has no English audio). Regardless, there is a significant plot point that literally links the main character to the Death Machine (which I won't spoil), and among all of the other cuts and edits this makes for a better movie.

    This horror/psycho thriller/sci fi story pits a hard-nosed, naive and ethical businesswoman against the existing power structure at a very large defense contractor, Chaank Industries. What Hayden Cale (Ely Puget) does not know is that, underlying most of what she knows as Chaank Industries, is a murderous maniac - Jack Dante. Dante is played by the remarkable, under-rated, Brad Dourif (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Eyes of Laura Mars, Blue Velvet, Dune, Wild Blue Yonder, Lord of the Rings, etc etc). Dante will do ANYTHING to avoid having his sick little world disturbed... anything. The plot and characters are a string of clich&eacute;s, but the movie does not take itself very seriously, and what results is a campy, intelligent, self-parody. Direct homages are paid to off-beat directors who frequently use comedy to liven up sci fi and horror stories - There are major supporting characters named Sam Raimi, John Carpenter and Scott Ridley. Dourif, the deft pacing of the film, and the cleverly written script make this predictable farce thoroughly enjoyable. Richard Brake makes a very good impression in a support role, and lead Puget is charismatic and manages to play her role laudably straight as a counterpoint to Dourif's utterly bizarre behavior. Death Machine was Stephen Norrington's directorial debut. Norrington has done and continues to do a lot of visual effects and robotics work on major releases which require substantial, cutting edge, effects. He also directed the decent but disappointing League of Extraordinary Gentlement and is now working on a re-make of The Crow.

    1.- (And most importantly) This movie needs to be released in its original uncut version of 120 minutues. 2.- This movie should only be seen in its original uncut version of 120 minutes. The UK 111 minute DVD cut is alright but not merely enough, or even admissible. Seriously, why not let Ridley say "Shut the *beep* up" to Carpenter at the corporate meeting scene and soooooooooooo on? Total mystery... And don't give me that crap that straight-to-video b-movies like this one shouldn't go on for 2 hours with all the insufferable long junk that's out there I mean, please. 3.- This movie deserves some kind website that makes justice to it's cult following. 4.- This movie is (like one of the reviewers here greately suggested) a total RIOT and therefore should be discovered (and even re-discovered) by all the rightfully lovig of the genre fans.

    This movie is really far from a great or interesting one but it's also a movie that starts to somewhat gets better as it progresses. It was a great movie that they decided on not making this movie a too straight or serious one. It's a movie with some quirky and comical moments. Had they decided to play this movie straight, it would had been a real bad and ridicules B-movie, with an obviously not too high budget. The movie instead now at times is even more of a spoof than a good movie on its own really. The movie is basically a whole bunch of many different genre movies thrown together, only made more entertaining to watch. It for most part makes "Death Machine" a pretty fun movie to watch but it also doesn't exactly surpasses the level of average. The script, the effects, the acting, it's all being pretty average. It's all good enough but not quite enough for the movie to stand out. I can see why this movie has a sort of a steady cult following but like basically almost every cult-favorite movie, the movie itself isn't exactly anything too great itself. It also really takes awhile for the movie to actually start off and become a good and interesting one. It wasn't about well halve way through that the movie finally really started to get my attention. It was Stephen Norrington directing debut and he must have got some attention with it, since his next directed movie would be the blockbuster "Blade", which in all honesty is the only real true great movie he has ever directed so far. All good and fun enough, especially when you're into the genre but also far from a great or perfect movie really. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Demented inventor Jack Dante (Brad Dourif) is busy building terror weapons for the amoral Chaank Armaments corporation. The new female chief executive wants his operation shut down but before she can get rid of him some inept saboteurs break in and Dante lets his toys loose. If you have even a passing interest in sci-fi or cyberpunk you are going to love this movie. Nothing dates faster than science fiction but there are exceptions and this is one of them. Sure, they have printers the size of an oven and speaking computers that sound like a female Stephen Hawking but most of the technology on show looks credible for a near-future setting. The casting is spot on, Brad Dourif is highly entertaining as the nutcase genius and the rest of the cast are pretty good too. I didn't expect much from this movie but I was entertained, if you haven't seen it give it a try I think you'll like it. Just as a final note, this movie currently has a totally unfair score of 5! That puts it on a par, in the minds of voters, with surefire crap like the lamentable Stepford Wives remake. IMDb should save people the trouble of voting and just give everything made this year a 10 and everything made earlier a 5, the final scores would be about the same.

    Watching this little movie after a decade or more , gave me the creeps again , still fresh , original , where the talent and actors' dedication , attention to detail , and the story count , and another proof that young directors must learn their ropes from the scratch ,and not from a 100 - million budget hand-outs , that turn their product into mush and the material to eternally laugh about! The movie is based on the shenanigans of a large weapons manufacturer corporation called Chaank, which has been accused of using children to produce super warriors and their new executive appointee , brilliantly portrayed by a little known E.Pouget with a tiny personal secret, who is determined to find out what exactly ' s been happening in the bowels of the beast , under the leadership of a brilliant young prodigy appropriately named J.Dante , played by B.Douriff ,and you have got to see this character , a sort of post-punk hippie with dreadlocks and an insatiable appetite for porn in all forms, who has secretly devised an ugly gadget ,and then the whole business gets very nasty , when every access and door is hermetically sealed,and the Dante guy sets a few conditions ,the most important being ' to interface ' with his unrequited blond obsession, or else the beast will get you ! If this movie reminds you of some other classics , namely ÂHardware , Alien , Carpenter's movies ,you are on the right track , as all the actors even bear the familiar names ,e.g. Scott Ridley , Yutani , Carpenter etc. Briefly , still fresh , amusing , and above all, hardcore , and utterly bleak !

The movie instead now at times is even more of a spoof than a good movie on its own really. The movie is basically a whole bunch of many different genre movies thrown together, only made more entertaining to watch. It for most part makes "Death Machine" a pretty fun movie to watch but it also doesn't exactly surpasses the level of average. The script, the effects, the acting, it's all being pretty average. It's all good enough but not quite enough for the movie to stand out. I can see why this movie has a sort of a steady cult following but like basically almost every cult-favorite movie, the movie itself isn't exactly anything too great itself. It also really takes awhile for the movie to actually start off and become a good and interesting one. It wasn't about well halve way through that the movie finally really started to get my attention. It was Stephen Norrington directing debut and he must have got some attention with it, since his next directed movie would be the blockbuster "Blade", which in all honesty is the only real true great movie he has ever directed so far. All good and fun enough, especially when you're into the genre but also far from a great or perfect movie really. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Demented inventor Jack Dante (Brad Dourif) is busy building terror weapons for the amoral Chaank Armaments corporation. The new female chief executive wants his operation shut down but before she can get rid of him some inept saboteurs break in and Dante lets his toys loose. If you have even a passing interest in sci-fi or cyberpunk you are going to love this movie. Nothing dates faster than science fiction but there are exceptions and this is one of them. Sure, they have printers the size of an oven and speaking computers that sound like a female Stephen Hawking but most of the technology on show looks credible for a near-future setting. The casting is spot on, Brad Dourif is highly entertaining as the nutcase genius and the rest of the cast are pretty good too. I didn't expect much from this movie but I was entertained, if you haven't seen it give it a try I think you'll like it. Just as a final note, this movie currently has a totally unfair score of 5! That puts it on a par, in the minds of voters, with surefire crap like the lamentable Stepford Wives remake. IMDb should save people the trouble of voting and just give everything made this year a 10 and everything made earlier a 5, the final scores would be about the same.

    Death machine is a science fiction film that came out in 1994. The movie takes place in 2023 in a cyberpunk type future that Blade Runner paved the way for. The story follows Hayden Cale, played by Ely Pouget, who is the CEO of Chaank Industries. Chaank Industries is secretly developing a death machine that can track its victims through fear. The creator of the machine is Jack Dante played by Brad Dourif. Hayden finds this out and tries to stop Dante, but he releases the machine to kill her and a group of stragglers. Together, they must destroy the creature and bring the secret to light. Overall I thought the film was okay, but there are a lot of problems with it. Firstly most of the characters I thought were very bland. The lead girl, Hayden, tries to be the Ripley of this film, but I do not think she pulls it off. I found her to be uninteresting as a character. The same with the other main characters. I was not invested in their characters, so I did not care if they lived or died. The one character I thought was a lot of fun is Brad Dourif's character Dante. He is so over-the-top that I just found him very enjoyable to watch. The acting is a mixed bag. The main cast did okay, but the supporting cast was horrible. For example, there was this random cop that appeared periodically in the film. The guy that played the cop is a terrible actor. He did not deliver one line naturally. Brad Dourif was the most over-the-top in the film acting wise. However, again he is so goofy that it is hard not to enjoy him. Dourif is easily one of the best aspects about this film. The effects are meh, in my opinion. The wide shot of the city looked good. The style reminded me a lot of Blade Runner. However, many of the other effects looked off. For example, the effects of the death machine when it is moving are laughable. The design of the machine itself is also very lackluster, in my opinion. Many elements of this film remind me of other Sci-Fi films like Blade Runner, Terminator, Alien, etc. However, those elements just made me think about how much better those movies are and how those elements are handled better in those films. Overall this is an okay film, but there are many better Sci-Fi films out there. If you are a fan of Bred Dourif, then I'd say give this a look.

    "Death Machine" was actually a nice surprise of a movie. Sure it is a spoof on movies such a "Robocop", "Aliens", "Terminator", "Die Hard" and movies in that caliber, but it was so much fun to watch. The story in "Death Machine" is about Jack Dante who works at a big corporation, who unleash a killing machine that he has been working on in secret after he becomes fired from his job. And it is up to a small group of people to stand up to this ultimate killer and stop it before it kills them. "Death Machine" was loads of fun to watch because it was so cheesy and campy. However, they had lots of nice stuff in the movie, lots of nice details and actually had decent enough props, sets and outfits. What I loved the most, personally, was the armored robotic suit that they put the guy in; in lots of scenes you could see it was just plastic covered foam he was wearing, as it was creasing and wrinkling as he bent and moved around. It was hilarious. Take a look at the names of the people in the movie; John Carpenter, Weyland, Yutani, Scott Ridley, etc. that was just amusing. Lots of fun references here, and if you are an avid movie-watcher, then you are bound to pick up on lots of hints and references here, there and everywhere. For a movie of this type, they had actually managed to put together a great cast ensemble, lots of faces that will be familiar to you if you watch a good deal of movies. It should be said, that the movie was being carried by Brad Dourif who played Jack Dante. "Death Machine" has a lot of action and actually have a good amount of entertainment value. I was surprised at the movie, as I had expected it to be a very, very low budget Sci-Fi movie. I was thoroughly entertained by the movie and must say that it was actually a great homage to various movies over the years. If you haven't seen "Death Machine" yet, get to it. Watch it for the cheesy movie that it is. Don't take it too serious. Watch it for all the references to other movies (if you are a movie fanatic). Watch it for the foamy body armor-suit. Watch it for the sheer fun that it is. Just watch it.

    This horror/psycho thriller/sci fi story pits a hard-nosed, naive and ethical businesswoman against the existing power structure at a very large defense contractor, Chaank Industries. What Hayden Cale (Ely Puget) does not know is that, underlying most of what she knows as Chaank Industries, is a murderous maniac - Jack Dante. Dante is played by the remarkable, under-rated, Brad Dourif (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Eyes of Laura Mars, Blue Velvet, Dune, Wild Blue Yonder, Lord of the Rings, etc etc). Dante will do ANYTHING to avoid having his sick little world disturbed... anything. The plot and characters are a string of clich&eacute;s, but the movie does not take itself very seriously, and what results is a campy, intelligent, self-parody. Direct homages are paid to off-beat directors who frequently use comedy to liven up sci fi and horror stories - There are major supporting characters named Sam Raimi, John Carpenter and Scott Ridley. Dourif, the deft pacing of the film, and the cleverly written script make this predictable farce thoroughly enjoyable. Richard Brake makes a very good impression in a support role, and lead Puget is charismatic and manages to play her role laudably straight as a counterpoint to Dourif's utterly bizarre behavior. Death Machine was Stephen Norrington's directorial debut. Norrington has done and continues to do a lot of visual effects and robotics work on major releases which require substantial, cutting edge, effects. He also directed the decent but disappointing League of Extraordinary Gentlement and is now working on a re-make of The Crow.

    Brad Dourif has made some pretty strange movies, but none as grievously annoying as "Death Machine". Do not, I repeat, do not let Dourif's presence entice you into seeing this pile of junk. He is fun to look at wearing an atrocious wig, but that's it. The acting and character development are excruciating, and the dialog is even worse. The entire film comes across as nothing more than a bad 1990s video game. Another annoyance is that the movie gives a feeling of claustrophobia, as if it was shot through a magnifying glass. Actors shouting at each other, plus the unending closeups is headache inducing. ...................... - MERK

    1.- (And most importantly) This movie needs to be released in its original uncut version of 120 minutues. 2.- This movie should only be seen in its original uncut version of 120 minutes. The UK 111 minute DVD cut is alright but not merely enough, or even admissible. Seriously, why not let Ridley say "Shut the *beep* up" to Carpenter at the corporate meeting scene and soooooooooooo on? Total mystery... And don't give me that crap that straight-to-video b-movies like this one shouldn't go on for 2 hours with all the insufferable long junk that's out there I mean, please. 3.- This movie deserves some kind website that makes justice to it's cult following. 4.- This movie is (like one of the reviewers here greately suggested) a total RIOT and therefore should be discovered (and even re-discovered) by all the rightfully lovig of the genre fans. Meaning the ones that can afford to really dig this. 5.- This movie alone should prove once and for all that Stephen Norrington is more than just another special-effects guy turned to film director (even though they say he hates this movie...) "We are talking Geraldo!"

    This movie is really far from a great or interesting one but it's also a movie that starts to somewhat gets better as it progresses. It was a great movie that they decided on not making this movie a too straight or serious one. It's a movie with some quirky and comical moments. Had they decided to play this movie straight, it would had been a real bad and ridicules B-movie, with an obviously not too high budget. The movie instead now at times is even more of a spoof than a good movie on its own really. The movie is basically a whole bunch of many different genre movies thrown together, only made more entertaining to watch. It for most part makes "Death Machine" a pretty fun movie to watch but it also doesn't exactly surpasses the level of average. The script, the effects, the acting, it's all being pretty average. It's all good enough but not quite enough for the movie to stand out. I can see why this movie has a sort of a steady cult following but like basically almost every cult-favorite movie, the movie itself isn't exactly anything too great itself. It also really takes awhile for the movie to actually start off and become a good and interesting one. It wasn't about well halve way through that the movie finally really started to get my attention. It was Stephen Norrington directing debut and he must have got some attention with it, since his next directed movie would be the blockbuster "Blade", which in all honesty is the only real true great movie he has ever directed so far.

The new female chief executive wants his operation shut down but before she can get rid of him some inept saboteurs break in and Dante lets his toys loose. If you have even a passing interest in sci-fi or cyberpunk you are going to love this movie. Nothing dates faster than science fiction but there are exceptions and this is one of them. Sure, they have printers the size of an oven and speaking computers that sound like a female Stephen Hawking but most of the technology on show looks credible for a near-future setting. The casting is spot on, Brad Dourif is highly entertaining as the nutcase genius and the rest of the cast are pretty good too. I didn't expect much from this movie but I was entertained, if you haven't seen it give it a try I think you'll like it. Just as a final note, this movie currently has a totally unfair score of 5! That puts it on a par, in the minds of voters, with surefire crap like the lamentable Stepford Wives remake.

    This movie is really far from a great or interesting one but it's also a movie that starts to somewhat gets better as it progresses. It was a great movie that they decided on not making this movie a too straight or serious one. It's a movie with some quirky and comical moments. Had they decided to play this movie straight, it would had been a real bad and ridicules B-movie, with an obviously not too high budget. The movie instead now at times is even more of a spoof than a good movie on its own really. The movie is basically a whole bunch of many different genre movies thrown together, only made more entertaining to watch. It for most part makes "Death Machine" a pretty fun movie to watch but it also doesn't exactly surpasses the level of average. The script, the effects, the acting, it's all being pretty average. It's all good enough but not quite enough for the movie to stand out. I can see why this movie has a sort of a steady cult following but like basically almost every cult-favorite movie, the movie itself isn't exactly anything too great itself. It also really takes awhile for the movie to actually start off and become a good and interesting one. It wasn't about well halve way through that the movie finally really started to get my attention. It was Stephen Norrington directing debut and he must have got some attention with it, since his next directed movie would be the blockbuster "Blade", which in all honesty is the only real true great movie he has ever directed so far. All good and fun enough, especially when you're into the genre but also far from a great or perfect movie really. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Demented inventor Jack Dante (Brad Dourif) is busy building terror weapons for the amoral Chaank Armaments corporation. The new female chief executive wants his operation shut down but before she can get rid of him some inept saboteurs break in and Dante lets his toys loose. If you have even a passing interest in sci-fi or cyberpunk you are going to love this movie. Nothing dates faster than science fiction but there are exceptions and this is one of them. Sure, they have printers the size of an oven and speaking computers that sound like a female Stephen Hawking but most of the technology on show looks credible for a near-future setting. The casting is spot on, Brad Dourif is highly entertaining as the nutcase genius and the rest of the cast are pretty good too. I didn't expect much from this movie but I was entertained, if you haven't seen it give it a try I think you'll like it. Just as a final note, this movie currently has a totally unfair score of 5! That puts it on a par, in the minds of voters, with surefire crap like the lamentable Stepford Wives remake. IMDb should save people the trouble of voting and just give everything made this year a 10 and everything made earlier a 5, the final scores would be about the same.

    Death machine is a science fiction film that came out in 1994. The movie takes place in 2023 in a cyberpunk type future that Blade Runner paved the way for. The story follows Hayden Cale, played by Ely Pouget, who is the CEO of Chaank Industries. Chaank Industries is secretly developing a death machine that can track its victims through fear. The creator of the machine is Jack Dante played by Brad Dourif. Hayden finds this out and tries to stop Dante, but he releases the machine to kill her and a group of stragglers. Together, they must destroy the creature and bring the secret to light. Overall I thought the film was okay, but there are a lot of problems with it. Firstly most of the characters I thought were very bland. The lead girl, Hayden, tries to be the Ripley of this film, but I do not think she pulls it off. I found her to be uninteresting as a character. The same with the other main characters. I was not invested in their characters, so I did not care if they lived or died. The one character I thought was a lot of fun is Brad Dourif's character Dante. He is so over-the-top that I just found him very enjoyable to watch. The acting is a mixed bag. The main cast did okay, but the supporting cast was horrible. For example, there was this random cop that appeared periodically in the film. The guy that played the cop is a terrible actor. He did not deliver one line naturally. Brad Dourif was the most over-the-top in the film acting wise. However, again he is so goofy that it is hard not to enjoy him. Dourif is easily one of the best aspects about this film. The effects are meh, in my opinion. The wide shot of the city looked good. The style reminded me a lot of Blade Runner. However, many of the other effects looked off. For example, the effects of the death machine when it is moving are laughable. The design of the machine itself is also very lackluster, in my opinion. Many elements of this film remind me of other Sci-Fi films like Blade Runner, Terminator, Alien, etc. However, those elements just made me think about how much better those movies are and how those elements are handled better in those films. Overall this is an okay film, but there are many better Sci-Fi films out there. If you are a fan of Bred Dourif, then I'd say give this a look.

    "Death Machine" was actually a nice surprise of a movie. Sure it is a spoof on movies such a "Robocop", "Aliens", "Terminator", "Die Hard" and movies in that caliber, but it was so much fun to watch. The story in "Death Machine" is about Jack Dante who works at a big corporation, who unleash a killing machine that he has been working on in secret after he becomes fired from his job. And it is up to a small group of people to stand up to this ultimate killer and stop it before it kills them. "Death Machine" was loads of fun to watch because it was so cheesy and campy. However, they had lots of nice stuff in the movie, lots of nice details and actually had decent enough props, sets and outfits. What I loved the most, personally, was the armored robotic suit that they put the guy in; in lots of scenes you could see it was just plastic covered foam he was wearing, as it was creasing and wrinkling as he bent and moved around. It was hilarious. Take a look at the names of the people in the movie; John Carpenter, Weyland, Yutani, Scott Ridley, etc. that was just amusing. Lots of fun references here, and if you are an avid movie-watcher, then you are bound to pick up on lots of hints and references here, there and everywhere. For a movie of this type, they had actually managed to put together a great cast ensemble, lots of faces that will be familiar to you if you watch a good deal of movies. It should be said, that the movie was being carried by Brad Dourif who played Jack Dante. "Death Machine" has a lot of action and actually have a good amount of entertainment value. I was surprised at the movie, as I had expected it to be a very, very low budget Sci-Fi movie. I was thoroughly entertained by the movie and must say that it was actually a great homage to various movies over the years. If you haven't seen "Death Machine" yet, get to it. Watch it for the cheesy movie that it is. Don't take it too serious. Watch it for all the references to other movies (if you are a movie fanatic). Watch it for the foamy body armor-suit. Watch it for the sheer fun that it is. Just watch it.

    Attractive but dim exec (Ely Pouget) has to fight against a fruitcake mad scientist/ computer genius (Brad Dourif) who has just built "death machine", a nine-foot-tall, fanged robotic creature which senses fear, and goes chomping through the high tech HQ after its creator is fired. A trio of cyberpunk computer hackers breaks into the building the same night "death machine" is unleashed, and end up running for their lives and fighting it also, and also to give the film a higher body count and a couple more plot complications. Robotic "death machine" creature looks effective, and its fall from the side of the building was done fairly well, but it takes too long for it to be introduced into the plot, and after it is,it disappears for too much time to really keep the momentum going all the way through, which keeps this cyberpunk slasher from being as much fun as it might have been. As it is, this ends up constantly veering from "so-bad-it's-good" to lame Die Hard ripoff. And speaking of lame, about that ending..... **1/2 out of ****

    Yeah, yeah, it's low-budget, but as someone else pointed out, the movie at least knows what it is and delivers it pretty well. I won't waste your time rewriting the plot synopsis, as you can read that above and below in the previous reviews. What I WILL say is that there is a significant difference between the 99 minute cut out on DVD and the 128 minute cut that is only available on a long OOP Japanese laserdisc and a long OOP German DVD (which looks fantastic, but has no English audio). Regardless, there is a significant plot point that literally links the main character to the Death Machine (which I won't spoil), and among all of the other cuts and edits this makes for a better movie. PS: keep an eye out for "Porkins".

    This horror/psycho thriller/sci fi story pits a hard-nosed, naive and ethical businesswoman against the existing power structure at a very large defense contractor, Chaank Industries. What Hayden Cale (Ely Puget) does not know is that, underlying most of what she knows as Chaank Industries, is a murderous maniac - Jack Dante. Dante is played by the remarkable, under-rated, Brad Dourif (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Eyes of Laura Mars, Blue Velvet, Dune, Wild Blue Yonder, Lord of the Rings, etc etc). Dante will do ANYTHING to avoid having his sick little world disturbed... anything. The plot and characters are a string of clich&eacute;s, but the movie does not take itself very seriously, and what results is a campy, intelligent, self-parody. Direct homages are paid to off-beat directors who frequently use comedy to liven up sci fi and horror stories - There are major supporting characters named Sam Raimi, John Carpenter and Scott Ridley. Dourif, the deft pacing of the film, and the cleverly written script make this predictable farce thoroughly enjoyable. Richard Brake makes a very good impression in a support role, and lead Puget is charismatic and manages to play her role laudably straight as a counterpoint to Dourif's utterly bizarre behavior. Death Machine was Stephen Norrington's directorial debut. Norrington has done and continues to do a lot of visual effects and robotics work on major releases which require substantial, cutting edge, effects. He also directed the decent but disappointing League of Extraordinary Gentlement and is now working on a re-make of The Crow.

    Brad Dourif has made some pretty strange movies, but none as grievously annoying as "Death Machine". Do not, I repeat, do not let Dourif's presence entice you into seeing this pile of junk. He is fun to look at wearing an atrocious wig, but that's it. The acting and character development are excruciating, and the dialog is even worse. The entire film comes across as nothing more than a bad 1990s video game. Another annoyance is that the movie gives a feeling of claustrophobia, as if it was shot through a magnifying glass. Actors shouting at each other, plus the unending closeups is headache inducing. ...................... - MERK
