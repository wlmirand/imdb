    Eddie Murphy's THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996) is one of the mainstream classics of the 1990s. It's a great comedy with an emotional center, focusing on a lonely, overweight college professor who falls in love with a beautiful grad student and takes an experimental formula to lose weight and become the kind of man the young lady would want. It's a twist on the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde story, with the formula bringing out a new personality in the scientist. Not that many viewers will care, but this update is a pretty faithful adaptation of Jerry Lewis's original 1963 film of the same name, in spirit at least. I've seen Lewis's film only once, but enjoyed it very much. In Lewis's version, the professor is almost grotesquely awkward and nerdy before being transformed into the suave hipster Buddy Love. This remake adds the weight loss angle, although the formula still makes Buddy Love a confident, smooth-talking ladies' man. The coolest guy in the room. Everyone knows that Eddie Murphy is inside the Sherman Klump fatsuit, although the makeup and Murphy's Sherman persona are very effective. Most people also know that Murphy plays the other members of the overweight Klump family as well, Sherman's mother, father, grandmother, and brother. Again the makeup jobs are great and Murphy brings each character to life. The famous dinner table scenes are comedic tours de force. What many people may not know is that Eddie Murphy also plays the white Richard Simmons-like fitness guru Lance Perkins. I know some people assumed it really was Richard Simmons, but it's Eddie Murphy again in heavy makeup. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR showcases Murphy's great talent for playing different characters. Jada Pinkett, best known today as the wife/mother in the Will Smith entertainment clan, plays the fetching young colleague who admires Professor Klump's work and steals his heart. Klump sets her up with his slimmed-down alter ego Buddy Love, though it becomes clear that Buddy is a self-centered monster who lacks the sensitivity and kindness that the girl admires in the professor. Meanwhile Buddy plots to destroy Sherman once and for all and take over his body on a more permanent basis. Larry Miller plays the villainous college dean, James Coburn plays a millionaire interested in contributing to the school, and a young Dave Chappelle plays an obnoxious stand-up comic. The movie has a mainstream comedy feel, with some hammy performances and a rather low-brow sense of humor. (The Klump family relies rather heavily on fart jokes.) The film is dated by its mid-'90s fashions and music scene and the digital visual effects are noticeably phony (though still effective). But the 1960s version is hopelessly dated as a product of another era, too. Movies can't help it sometimes. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR is a top of the line comedy with some great work by the chameleonic Eddie Murphy. The movie succeeds because it's a comedy with a heart. We sympathize with Sherman Klump. He's shy, self-conscious about his appearance, embarrassed by his outspoken family. The film has a "be yourself" message. This Jekyll & Hyde fable is a great concept, first realized by comedy legend Jerry Lewis and later updated for a whole new audience. I'm surprised other IMDb users have been so harsh with their ratings of this film.

    Like seriously this movie was so ******* hilarious I laughed at the fart jokes,and Eddie Murphy playing 7 CHARACTERS(he was the granny,the fitness instructor,the professor,Buddy Love,his mother,his father,and his brother,thanks to some special make up effects by Rick Baker who also did Susan Sarandon's transformation for Enchanted). The story is about a shy modest professor named Sherman Klumps,a man who is so shy to ask a girl on a date just because he is rather obese and his family are rather obese too. So since his a professor and all,he works on a formula that can turn obese people or obese animals into slim form. But when he tries it on himself he becomes the incredibly loud- mouthed,charming,womanizer,douch-bag Buddy Love. But when the girl that he fancy's(played by Will Smith's wife Jada Pinkett),he realizes that you have to accept who you are as a person no matter if your big or small. I know this film may offend people who are obese but for people who want a good laugh I recommend this film as I am a HUGE FAN of Eddie Murphy. Overall im giving it a 7/10

    Sherman Klump, is a brilliant and a very fat man. One day he meets a beautiful and charming woman named Carla Purty, and he falls in love with her. He is aware to the fact, though, that he is a clumsy fat guy, while she is a young gorgeous lady. This makes him feel depressed, but he finds the solution for his problem. He decides to drink a potion which he invented himself in his lab. The potion makes him everything he wanted to be. The new him, Buddy Love, is the perfect solution for Klump, in his opinion. But is that what Carla really wants........ Yes the film has plenty of fart jokes, and has been lambasted by. Any for being to in the toilets regarding the humour, but look deeper, and you have one of the most heartwarming comedies of the nineties, and a hilarious movie to boot. The scene in the club where Chapelle is heckling Klump, is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the movie, or really any comedy come to think of it, and this is down to the talent that Murphy has, yes he has made a few bombs the last few years, but this really shows his comic genius and great acting skills. The family scenes are brilliant and so funny, you really believe that all those characters are sitting round that table and interacting. Buddy Love surprisingly lets the film down. He starts off okay, but by the end he's just a pantomime villain who really really overacts. So all in all, it was a great return to form for Murphy, and like I've already said, proves that he is a really talented actor and comedian.

    I'll be very honest, i've only seen a few parts of this movie, but that was just enough, and I have 0 desire to watch the rest. This "Comedy" is just so unfunny and insulting to the intelligence! it consists of fart humour, and other unfunny garbage that people seem to find funny nowadays, which is just sad because there are many other comedy movies that are far funnier and superior but they seem to get overlooked nowadays. even sex lives of the potato men was more watchable compared to this. eddy murphy's career has already been ruined because he keeps starring in awful movies like this. overall, if you haven't seen this movie, avoid it, and pretend it doesn't exist, unless you're really that much of a masochist, or an idiot who laughs at unfunny fart humour.

    The Nutty Professor (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Hilarious remake of the Jerry Lewis film about the overweight Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) who comes up with a chemical that will turn anyone skinny overnight. Klump rushes the experiment on himself after an embarrassing night out and becomes the skinny but annoying Buddy Love (Murphy). At first Buddy thinks this is what he wants but the side effects quickly follow. I don't care what anyone says but Eddie Murphy should have won the Oscar for this film and yes I've seen all the nominations from that year. It's rather amazing to see what Murphy was able to do here, playing at least seven characters and making of them one of the most memorable you're ever going to see. I don't care who you are but when you see Sherman Klump you can't help but fall in love with the character and the way Murphy plays him is just something amazing to watch. Even the Buddy Love character is quite memorable and this doesn't even cover the Klump family that Murphy perfectly handles. Rick Baker also deserves a lot of credit for the special effects and these here have to be considered some of the greatest of his career. The film really does walk the line between hilarious comedy and some rather sad and dramatic moments. There's no question that the film really packs a punch no matter what it's trying to do. The story itself certainly comes with a message that's not preachy and I think Murphy really delivers it in a touching way. The one flaw with the film is that it breaks out of a realistic nature at times and especially with way too many fart jokes. Still, there's no question that this here is Murphy at his greatest and the Sherman character is just so great that you can't help but be won over by the film.

    Well, while it doesn't deny the necessity of self-improvement, it has the merit to assess the awareness of our specificity, our difference. And being aware of what we are stimulates the idea of our self-improvement as long as we keep aware of what we are not, and maybe the most important, what we can't and will never be. And the line between the incapability of this admittance and a low self-esteem is unfortunately, extremely thin. And "The Nutty Professor" is a wonderful comedy for its positive and insightful message about self-acceptance through a very sympathetic protagonist, Eddie Murphy as Professor Sherman Klump. Murphy perfectly diluted all his flamboyance and sometimes obnoxious flashiness in a sweet, gentle and likable character whose occupation besides teaching in college is to make DNA experiences on hamsters in order to find some medical solutions against obesity. Yet obesity doesn't seem to be an issue in his own life, not until he meets Carla Purty, his new colleague, played by the eye-pleasing Jada Pinckett Smith. Naturally, he falls in love, and we realize that we just meet Klump at a pivotal moment of his life, obesity became an issue. Tone-wise, Tom Shaydac's film finds the right balance between humor and sweetness. In one of the most hilarious cinematic family dinners, we meet the Klumps, a sight that works as a genetic alibi for Sherman's appearance. Eddie Murphy, who proved his chameleonic talent in such films as "Coming to America" is at the top of his game in "The Nutty Professor" where he's both a sweet and caring mother, a naughty Black mama, a mean-spirited blue-collar father, a superficial brother and Sherman Klump (the other character played by Murphy isn't featured in the scene, but you'd hardly recognize him as an Aerobic coach). The film, that won the Oscar for Best Make-Up, is the greatest credit to Murphy's talent when it comes to portray various characters. But there's more than discussions about weight and some farting contest in that dinner (always hilarious and never vulgar), the scene concludes with a beautiful exchange between Sherman and his mother. She loves him like any other mother, she sees both an inner and a physical beauty and we don't laugh at that. Whether he believed her or not is not the point, we can only sympathize with this good man, who wants this inner beauty to express itself. And when in the next scene, he asks Carla for a date, we understand Mama Klump found the right words to encourage her son to overcome his shyness. Carla is not indifferent to Sherman and accepts the date unaware that it would lead to a disaster because the restaurant stars a stand-up comedian who roasts people in the audience. Maybe I should have mentioned that the film is the remake of a Jerry Lewis' classic, but I don't think it's necessary since I know both stories are different. And I don't even think, the original is better just because it's the first one. All I know is I can more relate to a nerdy scientist who wants to be accepted by society than one who just wants to be a womanizer. Like so many great comedies like "Groundhog Day" or "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", there is a heart in "The Nutty Professor" and Eddie Murphy's so powerful that I could feel the way he felt. When everybody was getting their share of mocking jokes, he knew his turn was coming, and he would have it pretty bad (Dave Chappelle did a great job as the mean-spirited Reggie by the way), so when he tries to go to the toilet but unfortunately finds himself in the spotlight, we know the worst is to come. Murphy is so good in that role that it was impossible for me to laugh at Reggie's jokes; I could feel Sherman's broken heart, the devastation not just from the jokes, but from the people's reactions. The following scene is almost a tear-jerker when Carla tries to console him, he hardly speaks, the man was victim of a bullying that was the culmination of all the violence he tacitly endured. This is the pivotal moment where he decides to test his own researches on himself and become Buddy Love, a sort of Alpha Male who's got every thing a man can wish. Basically, Buddy Love is Eddie Murphy playing Eddie Murphy in the most irritating way, I missed Sherman Klump as soon as he disappeared but I forgive Buddy Love, if only for the magnificent revenge against Reggie, where the sprinkler became the sprinkled. Now, is the personality of Buddy Love irritating? I think it's the perfect representation of the way we indirectly perceive ourselves, since Sherman has low self-esteem, Buddy has exceedingly high self-esteem, it's his strength, his attitude almost embodies the whole 'Macho Man' theme song. Eddie Murphy mocks his own character as if he was aware that sometimes, being over confident can flirt with mean spiritedness, and he's so 'himself' that he manages to make us appreciate Sherman even more and this is the film's greatest message. I myself- had some issues with my appearance, and used to tell myself that I would be the most confident guy in the world if I had glasses, or if I were a few inches taller, but the meaning of our lives is not to wait for physical criteria to be confident and certainly not to compare ourselves to others, because that's the negation of our own specificity, and our capacity to contribute to the world on our own. The climactic speech is something I could respond to, it's the beautiful coming to realization of a man who didn't value himself enough while he had all the reasons to. It's like Eddie Murphy acknowledging that there is this soft spot he too often hided, because everybody expected him to be the smart-ass streetwise guy.

    Along with 'Beverly Hills Cop', it was the 'Nutty Professor' that cemented that signature Eddie Murphy smile as iconic. It's infectious and more often than not, serves to draw you more towards his characters. Although the protagonist is the sweet and unassuming Professor Klump, good old Eddie Murphy truly struts his stuff with the cocky, hyperactive alter ego, Buddy Love, the self proclaimed star of the show. The humour did, at times, descend to a very kiddish level with a comically obese man falling over and pushing things over, but the more mature hilarity really ensues with the 'embarassing family scenes', all the members of whom are portrayed by Murphy, underlining his prowess as a terrific multi character comedian regardless of age, gender or size. The chemistry between Murphy and Jada Pinkett was far from sizzling but Pinkett fulfilled the basic criteria of the love interest which allowed more attention to be shifted towards Murphy's two personas. A nice story which won't leave you in bouts of laughter upon finishing, but will bring more than a few throughout as you enjoy Eddie Murphy in his prime.

    Eddie Murphy has a reputation in Hollywood of being hard to work with and his track record since the late 90's hasn't been a good one. It makes it hard to remember just what a comedy genius this guy used to be, and The Nutty Professor is a prime example of that. Nobody else could have pulled off this role and made this film as good as it was. It's always been kind of a stupid story, but Murphy played into that and turned it into something that both kids and adults would find funny. No matter what you think of Eddie Murphy, it is impossible not to laugh during this movie. The Nutty Professor is two hours of fun, and on top of that, it's a refershing kind of comedy that we don't really see much of anymore.

    No (Fat) Joke, Sherman Klump is a Scholar and a Gentleman

    Even though a vast majority of the human population (present company included) does not possess, shall we say, a Greco-Roman physique, we nevertheless often belittle and disregard the overweight as somehow inferior. In the movies, this hypocritical bias is even more extreme. If an overweight person is (seldom) portrayed in a movie (whether as a star or in a supporting role), he/she will be either slow-witted, ill-tempered, clumsy, lazy, or some combination of all four. Most often, the overweight person will be there for one-dimensional comic relief. Eddie Murphy's character Sherman Klump in "The Nutty Professor" (hereafter "Nutty") goes a long way to correct most, if not all, of the overweight movie stereotypes, and against those hostile odds present an admirable human being indeed. Actually, Sherman in "Nutty" is mainly an inimitable character with many positive qualities. He is a brilliant, mostly well-respected biologist capable of revolutionary discoveries. Sherman is cultured, polite, dignified, charismatic and gracious, even under the most trying circumstances. He lives in a respectable apartment. He has a loving, if outspoken, family. Actually, apart from his obesity (and the inevitable maladroitness that comes with it), Sherman's only real shortcoming is his shyness and lack of self-assertion, especially around women. Even so, when Sherman meets beautiful but demure Wellman College colleague Carla Purdy (Jada Pinkett-Smith), her demure demeanor somehow gives him the courage to ask her out on a date. Sherman's life seems complete. However, when Sherman and Carla attend a comedy show, and Sherman endures a withering (but funny) barrage of fat jokes by kamikaze comedian Reggie (Dave Chappelle), the hurt and humiliation compel Sherman into a fateful decision. Never one to whine about his lot, Sherman determinedly (and hilariously) has tried every conceivable regimen (diet, exercise, acupuncture) to lose the pounds. Eventually, he begins to make progress, but not quickly enough. However, the weight-reduction serum Sherman has been distilling and testing on hamsters will accelerate the process. So after the comedy club debacle, Sherman impulsively swigs some of the serum, which astoundingly transforms him into the svelte, dynamic Buddy Love (Eddie in "real life", without the padding). Trouble is, Sherman/Buddy may be more slender, but the serum somehow boosts his testosterone levels alarmingly so that the handsome stud also becomes insufferable, loud, and embarrassing. These qualities simultaneously attract and repel Carla and the audience. Buddy's abrasive manner isn't the only problem. It seems that the serum has only a temporary effect and tends to wear off at inopportune moments, such as when Buddy's transformation back to portly Sherman interrupts his date with Carla and eventually gets him wedged inside a Viper sports car. And so it progresses. With each Sherman/Buddy change and reversion, the audience slowly learns that, counter to what Sherman initially believes, fewer and fewer people prefer Buddy. In fact, the subconscious impermanence of the serum indicates, to me anyway, that Sherman really, and correctly, prefers himself to Buddy. However, alter ego Buddy soon shows his selfish monstrousness. With his devious talk, his promiscuity, and his plotting, Buddy causes Sherman to lose just about everything good in his life - job, home, a social life. Worst of all, Sherman will lose his very identity if Buddy manages to take two timed gulps of his formula to remain Buddy forever. Like Jekyll fighting Hyde, Sherman literally has to get his life back. At an ornate gala where a pharmaceutical manufacturer Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is expected to fund Sherman's college research, the fight does occur. After a titanic struggle, Sherman reclaims his body. Again, in a dignified heartfelt speech Sherman apologizes for the calamities, hurt, and chaos he has caused as Buddy and finally learns that you have to love and be comfortable with yourself. This candor impresses Harlan enough to make the grant, and charms Carla enough to accept a dance with Sherman. Funny thing about the fat jokes, comments, and slapstick throughout the movie - we laugh at them, but not at the person who endures them. Whether getting stuck in a chair or car, or erasing a blackboard with his belly, or getting chewed out by a venal, insulting, weaselly dean (Larry Miller) or struggling to walk up stairs or exercise, Sherman preserves his dignity and likability. We even wince a little, because such a nice, accomplished person should not have to put up with such misadventures. Through the laughter, we urge Sherman to find the courage, self-assertion, and self-love to get the happiness he deserves. Even his seemingly uncouth and raunchy family (most members played by the versatile Murphy himself) point him in that direction; they may be fat and flatulent and undisciplined, but they also love and accept themselves exactly as they are. In a distorted way, even Sherman's alter ego Buddy tries to urge Sherman forward. "No matter what, you got to strut!" And so Sherman ultimately does, because at heart, he was always a scholar and a gentleman.

    You know many films that come out today don't have a good moral to the story. Many of today's films lack a good message and are more about style then substance. You know those films with nothing but sex and violence; nothing good but the special effects that are really not so special anymore. This film however was made soon before the film industry went on it's downward spiral. Poor Sherman Klump. He works as a professor at a local college and he is looking for a way to lose weight. He comes up with a solution. A liquid that will progressively bring his weight down slowly. One day he meets a woman named Carla and he falls hard for her. He decides to take her out for a date. They end up at a Comedy Club called The Scream. While there they enjoy an evening of music. At some point however a heckler named Reggie who takes people from the audience and makes fun of their looks. Unfortunately Sherman knows whats going on and decides to get up and leave however the spotlight finds his butt and Reggie goes all out with his fat jokes. Sherman is saddened and goes home upset. He has a dream where he becomes really fat. Sherman wakes up frightened and decides that he is going to become thin once and for all. He goes to his lab and takes some of the solution. He ends up passing out and in the morning he wakes up super thin. This is where his life will take a serious turn for the worse. He decides that he is going to take the solution to take out Carla and try to impress her as an alias under Buddy Love. Carla likes him at first but one problem Sherman has is that the solution wears off after awhile and he has to take more to stay in his thin Buddy form. Another drawback of the solution is that his testosterone levels go through the roof when he takes it. Sherman is being overcome by his new counterpart Buddy and Buddy wants to take all the credit for the professors solution. Professor Klump is able to beat Buddy and admits to everyone that he was so obsessed with losing weight and fitting in that he lost track of what he really wanted to do which was to help people. Carla had no problem with Sherman even while he was fat and she really liked him for who he was. The Nutty Professor has some potty humor in it but it still has a great message. Be happy with who you are. Don't let the jerks get you down. I have to agree that fat people are one of the most made fun of today along with people gays. When will people start to become more caring about people's real beauty and stop worrying about self image? We need more movies like this today. Our society is becoming more concerned with looks more and more everyday. Even young girls are being targeted. This is a movie that shows where the real beauty is; inside and not out.

I'm surprised other IMDb users have been so harsh with their ratings of this film.

The story is about a shy modest professor named Sherman Klumps,a man who is so shy to ask a girl on a date just because he is rather obese and his family are rather obese too. So since his a professor and all,he works on a formula that can turn obese people or obese animals into slim form. But when he tries it on himself he becomes the incredibly loud- mouthed,charming,womanizer,douch-bag Buddy Love. But when the girl that he fancy's(played by Will Smith's wife Jada Pinkett),he realizes that you have to accept who you are as a person no matter if your big or small. I know this film may offend people who are obese but for people who want a good laugh I recommend this film as I am a HUGE FAN of Eddie Murphy. Overall im giving it a 7/10

    Sherman Klump, is a brilliant and a very fat man. One day he meets a beautiful and charming woman named Carla Purty, and he falls in love with her. He is aware to the fact, though, that he is a clumsy fat guy, while she is a young gorgeous lady. This makes him feel depressed, but he finds the solution for his problem. He decides to drink a potion which he invented himself in his lab. The potion makes him everything he wanted to be. The new him, Buddy Love, is the perfect solution for Klump, in his opinion. But is that what Carla really wants........ Yes the film has plenty of fart jokes, and has been lambasted by. Any for being to in the toilets regarding the humour, but look deeper, and you have one of the most heartwarming comedies of the nineties, and a hilarious movie to boot. The scene in the club where Chapelle is heckling Klump, is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the movie, or really any comedy come to think of it, and this is down to the talent that Murphy has, yes he has made a few bombs the last few years, but this really shows his comic genius and great acting skills. The family scenes are brilliant and so funny, you really believe that all those characters are sitting round that table and interacting. Buddy Love surprisingly lets the film down. He starts off okay, but by the end he's just a pantomime villain who really really overacts. So all in all, it was a great return to form for Murphy, and like I've already said, proves that he is a really talented actor and comedian.

    I'll be very honest, i've only seen a few parts of this movie, but that was just enough, and I have 0 desire to watch the rest. This "Comedy" is just so unfunny and insulting to the intelligence! it consists of fart humour, and other unfunny garbage that people seem to find funny nowadays, which is just sad because there are many other comedy movies that are far funnier and superior but they seem to get overlooked nowadays. even sex lives of the potato men was more watchable compared to this. eddy murphy's career has already been ruined because he keeps starring in awful movies like this. overall, if you haven't seen this movie, avoid it, and pretend it doesn't exist, unless you're really that much of a masochist, or an idiot who laughs at unfunny fart humour.

    The Nutty Professor (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Hilarious remake of the Jerry Lewis film about the overweight Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) who comes up with a chemical that will turn anyone skinny overnight. Klump rushes the experiment on himself after an embarrassing night out and becomes the skinny but annoying Buddy Love (Murphy). At first Buddy thinks this is what he wants but the side effects quickly follow. I don't care what anyone says but Eddie Murphy should have won the Oscar for this film and yes I've seen all the nominations from that year. It's rather amazing to see what Murphy was able to do here, playing at least seven characters and making of them one of the most memorable you're ever going to see. I don't care who you are but when you see Sherman Klump you can't help but fall in love with the character and the way Murphy plays him is just something amazing to watch. Even the Buddy Love character is quite memorable and this doesn't even cover the Klump family that Murphy perfectly handles. Rick Baker also deserves a lot of credit for the special effects and these here have to be considered some of the greatest of his career. The film really does walk the line between hilarious comedy and some rather sad and dramatic moments. There's no question that the film really packs a punch no matter what it's trying to do. The story itself certainly comes with a message that's not preachy and I think Murphy really delivers it in a touching way. The one flaw with the film is that it breaks out of a realistic nature at times and especially with way too many fart jokes. Still, there's no question that this here is Murphy at his greatest and the Sherman character is just so great that you can't help but be won over by the film.

    Well, while it doesn't deny the necessity of self-improvement, it has the merit to assess the awareness of our specificity, our difference. And being aware of what we are stimulates the idea of our self-improvement as long as we keep aware of what we are not, and maybe the most important, what we can't and will never be. And the line between the incapability of this admittance and a low self-esteem is unfortunately, extremely thin. And "The Nutty Professor" is a wonderful comedy for its positive and insightful message about self-acceptance through a very sympathetic protagonist, Eddie Murphy as Professor Sherman Klump. Murphy perfectly diluted all his flamboyance and sometimes obnoxious flashiness in a sweet, gentle and likable character whose occupation besides teaching in college is to make DNA experiences on hamsters in order to find some medical solutions against obesity. Yet obesity doesn't seem to be an issue in his own life, not until he meets Carla Purty, his new colleague, played by the eye-pleasing Jada Pinckett Smith. Naturally, he falls in love, and we realize that we just meet Klump at a pivotal moment of his life, obesity became an issue. Tone-wise, Tom Shaydac's film finds the right balance between humor and sweetness. In one of the most hilarious cinematic family dinners, we meet the Klumps, a sight that works as a genetic alibi for Sherman's appearance. Eddie Murphy, who proved his chameleonic talent in such films as "Coming to America" is at the top of his game in "The Nutty Professor" where he's both a sweet and caring mother, a naughty Black mama, a mean-spirited blue-collar father, a superficial brother and Sherman Klump (the other character played by Murphy isn't featured in the scene, but you'd hardly recognize him as an Aerobic coach). The film, that won the Oscar for Best Make-Up, is the greatest credit to Murphy's talent when it comes to portray various characters. But there's more than discussions about weight and some farting contest in that dinner (always hilarious and never vulgar), the scene concludes with a beautiful exchange between Sherman and his mother. She loves him like any other mother, she sees both an inner and a physical beauty and we don't laugh at that. Whether he believed her or not is not the point, we can only sympathize with this good man, who wants this inner beauty to express itself. And when in the next scene, he asks Carla for a date, we understand Mama Klump found the right words to encourage her son to overcome his shyness. Carla is not indifferent to Sherman and accepts the date unaware that it would lead to a disaster because the restaurant stars a stand-up comedian who roasts people in the audience. Maybe I should have mentioned that the film is the remake of a Jerry Lewis' classic, but I don't think it's necessary since I know both stories are different. And I don't even think, the original is better just because it's the first one. All I know is I can more relate to a nerdy scientist who wants to be accepted by society than one who just wants to be a womanizer. Like so many great comedies like "Groundhog Day" or "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", there is a heart in "The Nutty Professor" and Eddie Murphy's so powerful that I could feel the way he felt. When everybody was getting their share of mocking jokes, he knew his turn was coming, and he would have it pretty bad (Dave Chappelle did a great job as the mean-spirited Reggie by the way), so when he tries to go to the toilet but unfortunately finds himself in the spotlight, we know the worst is to come. Murphy is so good in that role that it was impossible for me to laugh at Reggie's jokes; I could feel Sherman's broken heart, the devastation not just from the jokes, but from the people's reactions. The following scene is almost a tear-jerker when Carla tries to console him, he hardly speaks, the man was victim of a bullying that was the culmination of all the violence he tacitly endured. This is the pivotal moment where he decides to test his own researches on himself and become Buddy Love, a sort of Alpha Male who's got every thing a man can wish. Basically, Buddy Love is Eddie Murphy playing Eddie Murphy in the most irritating way, I missed Sherman Klump as soon as he disappeared but I forgive Buddy Love, if only for the magnificent revenge against Reggie, where the sprinkler became the sprinkled. Now, is the personality of Buddy Love irritating? I think it's the perfect representation of the way we indirectly perceive ourselves, since Sherman has low self-esteem, Buddy has exceedingly high self-esteem, it's his strength, his attitude almost embodies the whole 'Macho Man' theme song. Eddie Murphy mocks his own character as if he was aware that sometimes, being over confident can flirt with mean spiritedness, and he's so 'himself' that he manages to make us appreciate Sherman even more and this is the film's greatest message. I myself- had some issues with my appearance, and used to tell myself that I would be the most confident guy in the world if I had glasses, or if I were a few inches taller, but the meaning of our lives is not to wait for physical criteria to be confident and certainly not to compare ourselves to others, because that's the negation of our own specificity, and our capacity to contribute to the world on our own. The climactic speech is something I could respond to, it's the beautiful coming to realization of a man who didn't value himself enough while he had all the reasons to. It's like Eddie Murphy acknowledging that there is this soft spot he too often hided, because everybody expected him to be the smart-ass streetwise guy.

    Along with 'Beverly Hills Cop', it was the 'Nutty Professor' that cemented that signature Eddie Murphy smile as iconic. It's infectious and more often than not, serves to draw you more towards his characters. Although the protagonist is the sweet and unassuming Professor Klump, good old Eddie Murphy truly struts his stuff with the cocky, hyperactive alter ego, Buddy Love, the self proclaimed star of the show. The humour did, at times, descend to a very kiddish level with a comically obese man falling over and pushing things over, but the more mature hilarity really ensues with the 'embarassing family scenes', all the members of whom are portrayed by Murphy, underlining his prowess as a terrific multi character comedian regardless of age, gender or size. The chemistry between Murphy and Jada Pinkett was far from sizzling but Pinkett fulfilled the basic criteria of the love interest which allowed more attention to be shifted towards Murphy's two personas. A nice story which won't leave you in bouts of laughter upon finishing, but will bring more than a few throughout as you enjoy Eddie Murphy in his prime.

    Eddie Murphy has a reputation in Hollywood of being hard to work with and his track record since the late 90's hasn't been a good one. It makes it hard to remember just what a comedy genius this guy used to be, and The Nutty Professor is a prime example of that. Nobody else could have pulled off this role and made this film as good as it was. It's always been kind of a stupid story, but Murphy played into that and turned it into something that both kids and adults would find funny. No matter what you think of Eddie Murphy, it is impossible not to laugh during this movie. The Nutty Professor is two hours of fun, and on top of that, it's a refershing kind of comedy that we don't really see much of anymore.

    No (Fat) Joke, Sherman Klump is a Scholar and a Gentleman

    Even though a vast majority of the human population (present company included) does not possess, shall we say, a Greco-Roman physique, we nevertheless often belittle and disregard the overweight as somehow inferior. In the movies, this hypocritical bias is even more extreme. If an overweight person is (seldom) portrayed in a movie (whether as a star or in a supporting role), he/she will be either slow-witted, ill-tempered, clumsy, lazy, or some combination of all four. Most often, the overweight person will be there for one-dimensional comic relief. Eddie Murphy's character Sherman Klump in "The Nutty Professor" (hereafter "Nutty") goes a long way to correct most, if not all, of the overweight movie stereotypes, and against those hostile odds present an admirable human being indeed. Actually, Sherman in "Nutty" is mainly an inimitable character with many positive qualities. He is a brilliant, mostly well-respected biologist capable of revolutionary discoveries. Sherman is cultured, polite, dignified, charismatic and gracious, even under the most trying circumstances. He lives in a respectable apartment. He has a loving, if outspoken, family. Actually, apart from his obesity (and the inevitable maladroitness that comes with it), Sherman's only real shortcoming is his shyness and lack of self-assertion, especially around women. Even so, when Sherman meets beautiful but demure Wellman College colleague Carla Purdy (Jada Pinkett-Smith), her demure demeanor somehow gives him the courage to ask her out on a date. Sherman's life seems complete. However, when Sherman and Carla attend a comedy show, and Sherman endures a withering (but funny) barrage of fat jokes by kamikaze comedian Reggie (Dave Chappelle), the hurt and humiliation compel Sherman into a fateful decision. Never one to whine about his lot, Sherman determinedly (and hilariously) has tried every conceivable regimen (diet, exercise, acupuncture) to lose the pounds. Eventually, he begins to make progress, but not quickly enough. However, the weight-reduction serum Sherman has been distilling and testing on hamsters will accelerate the process. So after the comedy club debacle, Sherman impulsively swigs some of the serum, which astoundingly transforms him into the svelte, dynamic Buddy Love (Eddie in "real life", without the padding). Trouble is, Sherman/Buddy may be more slender, but the serum somehow boosts his testosterone levels alarmingly so that the handsome stud also becomes insufferable, loud, and embarrassing. These qualities simultaneously attract and repel Carla and the audience. Buddy's abrasive manner isn't the only problem. It seems that the serum has only a temporary effect and tends to wear off at inopportune moments, such as when Buddy's transformation back to portly Sherman interrupts his date with Carla and eventually gets him wedged inside a Viper sports car. And so it progresses. With each Sherman/Buddy change and reversion, the audience slowly learns that, counter to what Sherman initially believes, fewer and fewer people prefer Buddy. In fact, the subconscious impermanence of the serum indicates, to me anyway, that Sherman really, and correctly, prefers himself to Buddy. However, alter ego Buddy soon shows his selfish monstrousness. With his devious talk, his promiscuity, and his plotting, Buddy causes Sherman to lose just about everything good in his life - job, home, a social life. Worst of all, Sherman will lose his very identity if Buddy manages to take two timed gulps of his formula to remain Buddy forever. Like Jekyll fighting Hyde, Sherman literally has to get his life back. At an ornate gala where a pharmaceutical manufacturer Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is expected to fund Sherman's college research, the fight does occur. After a titanic struggle, Sherman reclaims his body. Again, in a dignified heartfelt speech Sherman apologizes for the calamities, hurt, and chaos he has caused as Buddy and finally learns that you have to love and be comfortable with yourself. This candor impresses Harlan enough to make the grant, and charms Carla enough to accept a dance with Sherman. Funny thing about the fat jokes, comments, and slapstick throughout the movie - we laugh at them, but not at the person who endures them. Whether getting stuck in a chair or car, or erasing a blackboard with his belly, or getting chewed out by a venal, insulting, weaselly dean (Larry Miller) or struggling to walk up stairs or exercise, Sherman preserves his dignity and likability. We even wince a little, because such a nice, accomplished person should not have to put up with such misadventures. Through the laughter, we urge Sherman to find the courage, self-assertion, and self-love to get the happiness he deserves. Even his seemingly uncouth and raunchy family (most members played by the versatile Murphy himself) point him in that direction; they may be fat and flatulent and undisciplined, but they also love and accept themselves exactly as they are. In a distorted way, even Sherman's alter ego Buddy tries to urge Sherman forward. "No matter what, you got to strut!" And so Sherman ultimately does, because at heart, he was always a scholar and a gentleman.

    You know many films that come out today don't have a good moral to the story. Many of today's films lack a good message and are more about style then substance. You know those films with nothing but sex and violence; nothing good but the special effects that are really not so special anymore. This film however was made soon before the film industry went on it's downward spiral. Poor Sherman Klump. He works as a professor at a local college and he is looking for a way to lose weight. He comes up with a solution. A liquid that will progressively bring his weight down slowly. One day he meets a woman named Carla and he falls hard for her. He decides to take her out for a date. They end up at a Comedy Club called The Scream. While there they enjoy an evening of music. At some point however a heckler named Reggie who takes people from the audience and makes fun of their looks. Unfortunately Sherman knows whats going on and decides to get up and leave however the spotlight finds his butt and Reggie goes all out with his fat jokes. Sherman is saddened and goes home upset. He has a dream where he becomes really fat. Sherman wakes up frightened and decides that he is going to become thin once and for all. He goes to his lab and takes some of the solution. He ends up passing out and in the morning he wakes up super thin. This is where his life will take a serious turn for the worse. He decides that he is going to take the solution to take out Carla and try to impress her as an alias under Buddy Love. Carla likes him at first but one problem Sherman has is that the solution wears off after awhile and he has to take more to stay in his thin Buddy form. Another drawback of the solution is that his testosterone levels go through the roof when he takes it. Sherman is being overcome by his new counterpart Buddy and Buddy wants to take all the credit for the professors solution. Professor Klump is able to beat Buddy and admits to everyone that he was so obsessed with losing weight and fitting in that he lost track of what he really wanted to do which was to help people. Carla had no problem with Sherman even while he was fat and she really liked him for who he was. The Nutty Professor has some potty humor in it but it still has a great message. Be happy with who you are. Don't let the jerks get you down. I have to agree that fat people are one of the most made fun of today along with people gays. When will people start to become more caring about people's real beauty and stop worrying about self image? We need more movies like this today. Our society is becoming more concerned with looks more and more everyday. Even young girls are being targeted. This is a movie that shows where the real beauty is; inside and not out.

    Eddie Murphy's THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996) is one of the mainstream classics of the 1990s. It's a great comedy with an emotional center, focusing on a lonely, overweight college professor who falls in love with a beautiful grad student and takes an experimental formula to lose weight and become the kind of man the young lady would want. It's a twist on the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde story, with the formula bringing out a new personality in the scientist. Not that many viewers will care, but this update is a pretty faithful adaptation of Jerry Lewis's original 1963 film of the same name, in spirit at least. I've seen Lewis's film only once, but enjoyed it very much. In Lewis's version, the professor is almost grotesquely awkward and nerdy before being transformed into the suave hipster Buddy Love. This remake adds the weight loss angle, although the formula still makes Buddy Love a confident, smooth-talking ladies' man. The coolest guy in the room. Everyone knows that Eddie Murphy is inside the Sherman Klump fatsuit, although the makeup and Murphy's Sherman persona are very effective. Most people also know that Murphy plays the other members of the overweight Klump family as well, Sherman's mother, father, grandmother, and brother. Again the makeup jobs are great and Murphy brings each character to life. The famous dinner table scenes are comedic tours de force. What many people may not know is that Eddie Murphy also plays the white Richard Simmons-like fitness guru Lance Perkins. I know some people assumed it really was Richard Simmons, but it's Eddie Murphy again in heavy makeup. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR showcases Murphy's great talent for playing different characters. Jada Pinkett, best known today as the wife/mother in the Will Smith entertainment clan, plays the fetching young colleague who admires Professor Klump's work and steals his heart. Klump sets her up with his slimmed-down alter ego Buddy Love, though it becomes clear that Buddy is a self-centered monster who lacks the sensitivity and kindness that the girl admires in the professor. Meanwhile Buddy plots to destroy Sherman once and for all and take over his body on a more permanent basis. Larry Miller plays the villainous college dean, James Coburn plays a millionaire interested in contributing to the school, and a young Dave Chappelle plays an obnoxious stand-up comic. The movie has a mainstream comedy feel, with some hammy performances and a rather low-brow sense of humor. (The Klump family relies rather heavily on fart jokes.) The film is dated by its mid-'90s fashions and music scene and the digital visual effects are noticeably phony (though still effective). But the 1960s version is hopelessly dated as a product of another era, too. Movies can't help it sometimes. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR is a top of the line comedy with some great work by the chameleonic Eddie Murphy. The movie succeeds because it's a comedy with a heart. We sympathize with Sherman Klump. He's shy, self-conscious about his appearance, embarrassed by his outspoken family. The film has a "be yourself" message. This Jekyll & Hyde fable is a great concept, first realized by comedy legend Jerry Lewis and later updated for a whole new audience. I'm surprised other IMDb users have been so harsh with their ratings of this film.

    Well, while it doesn't deny the necessity of self-improvement, it has the merit to assess the awareness of our specificity, our difference. And being aware of what we are stimulates the idea of our self-improvement as long as we keep aware of what we are not, and maybe the most important, what we can't and will never be. And the line between the incapability of this admittance and a low self-esteem is unfortunately, extremely thin. And "The Nutty Professor" is a wonderful comedy for its positive and insightful message about self-acceptance through a very sympathetic protagonist, Eddie Murphy as Professor Sherman Klump. Murphy perfectly diluted all his flamboyance and sometimes obnoxious flashiness in a sweet, gentle and likable character whose occupation besides teaching in college is to make DNA experiences on hamsters in order to find some medical solutions against obesity. Yet obesity doesn't seem to be an issue in his own life, not until he meets Carla Purty, his new colleague, played by the eye-pleasing Jada Pinckett Smith. Naturally, he falls in love, and we realize that we just meet Klump at a pivotal moment of his life, obesity became an issue. Tone-wise, Tom Shaydac's film finds the right balance between humor and sweetness. In one of the most hilarious cinematic family dinners, we meet the Klumps, a sight that works as a genetic alibi for Sherman's appearance. Eddie Murphy, who proved his chameleonic talent in such films as "Coming to America" is at the top of his game in "The Nutty Professor" where he's both a sweet and caring mother, a naughty Black mama, a mean-spirited blue-collar father, a superficial brother and Sherman Klump (the other character played by Murphy isn't featured in the scene, but you'd hardly recognize him as an Aerobic coach). The film, that won the Oscar for Best Make-Up, is the greatest credit to Murphy's talent when it comes to portray various characters. But there's more than discussions about weight and some farting contest in that dinner (always hilarious and never vulgar), the scene concludes with a beautiful exchange between Sherman and his mother. She loves him like any other mother, she sees both an inner and a physical beauty and we don't laugh at that. Whether he believed her or not is not the point, we can only sympathize with this good man, who wants this inner beauty to express itself. And when in the next scene, he asks Carla for a date, we understand Mama Klump found the right words to encourage her son to overcome his shyness. Carla is not indifferent to Sherman and accepts the date unaware that it would lead to a disaster because the restaurant stars a stand-up comedian who roasts people in the audience. Maybe I should have mentioned that the film is the remake of a Jerry Lewis' classic, but I don't think it's necessary since I know both stories are different. And I don't even think, the original is better just because it's the first one. All I know is I can more relate to a nerdy scientist who wants to be accepted by society than one who just wants to be a womanizer. Like so many great comedies like "Groundhog Day" or "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", there is a heart in "The Nutty Professor" and Eddie Murphy's so powerful that I could feel the way he felt. When everybody was getting their share of mocking jokes, he knew his turn was coming, and he would have it pretty bad (Dave Chappelle did a great job as the mean-spirited Reggie by the way), so when he tries to go to the toilet but unfortunately finds himself in the spotlight, we know the worst is to come. Murphy is so good in that role that it was impossible for me to laugh at Reggie's jokes; I could feel Sherman's broken heart, the devastation not just from the jokes, but from the people's reactions. The following scene is almost a tear-jerker when Carla tries to console him, he hardly speaks, the man was victim of a bullying that was the culmination of all the violence he tacitly endured. This is the pivotal moment where he decides to test his own researches on himself and become Buddy Love, a sort of Alpha Male who's got every thing a man can wish. Basically, Buddy Love is Eddie Murphy playing Eddie Murphy in the most irritating way, I missed Sherman Klump as soon as he disappeared but I forgive Buddy Love, if only for the magnificent revenge against Reggie, where the sprinkler became the sprinkled. Now, is the personality of Buddy Love irritating? I think it's the perfect representation of the way we indirectly perceive ourselves, since Sherman has low self-esteem, Buddy has exceedingly high self-esteem, it's his strength, his attitude almost embodies the whole 'Macho Man' theme song. Eddie Murphy mocks his own character as if he was aware that sometimes, being over confident can flirt with mean spiritedness, and he's so 'himself' that he manages to make us appreciate Sherman even more and this is the film's greatest message. I myself- had some issues with my appearance, and used to tell myself that I would be the most confident guy in the world if I had glasses, or if I were a few inches taller, but the meaning of our lives is not to wait for physical criteria to be confident and certainly not to compare ourselves to others, because that's the negation of our own specificity, and our capacity to contribute to the world on our own. The climactic speech is something I could respond to, it's the beautiful coming to realization of a man who didn't value himself enough while he had all the reasons to. It's like Eddie Murphy acknowledging that there is this soft spot he too often hided, because everybody expected him to be the smart-ass streetwise guy.

    Along with 'Beverly Hills Cop', it was the 'Nutty Professor' that cemented that signature Eddie Murphy smile as iconic. It's infectious and more often than not, serves to draw you more towards his characters. Although the protagonist is the sweet and unassuming Professor Klump, good old Eddie Murphy truly struts his stuff with the cocky, hyperactive alter ego, Buddy Love, the self proclaimed star of the show. The humour did, at times, descend to a very kiddish level with a comically obese man falling over and pushing things over, but the more mature hilarity really ensues with the 'embarassing family scenes', all the members of whom are portrayed by Murphy, underlining his prowess as a terrific multi character comedian regardless of age, gender or size. The chemistry between Murphy and Jada Pinkett was far from sizzling but Pinkett fulfilled the basic criteria of the love interest which allowed more attention to be shifted towards Murphy's two personas. A nice story which won't leave you in bouts of laughter upon finishing, but will bring more than a few throughout as you enjoy Eddie Murphy in his prime.

    Eddie Murphy has a reputation in Hollywood of being hard to work with and his track record since the late 90's hasn't been a good one. It makes it hard to remember just what a comedy genius this guy used to be, and The Nutty Professor is a prime example of that. Nobody else could have pulled off this role and made this film as good as it was. It's always been kind of a stupid story, but Murphy played into that and turned it into something that both kids and adults would find funny. No matter what you think of Eddie Murphy, it is impossible not to laugh during this movie. The Nutty Professor is two hours of fun, and on top of that, it's a refershing kind of comedy that we don't really see much of anymore.

    No (Fat) Joke, Sherman Klump is a Scholar and a Gentleman

    Even though a vast majority of the human population (present company included) does not possess, shall we say, a Greco-Roman physique, we nevertheless often belittle and disregard the overweight as somehow inferior. In the movies, this hypocritical bias is even more extreme. If an overweight person is (seldom) portrayed in a movie (whether as a star or in a supporting role), he/she will be either slow-witted, ill-tempered, clumsy, lazy, or some combination of all four. Most often, the overweight person will be there for one-dimensional comic relief. Eddie Murphy's character Sherman Klump in "The Nutty Professor" (hereafter "Nutty") goes a long way to correct most, if not all, of the overweight movie stereotypes, and against those hostile odds present an admirable human being indeed. Actually, Sherman in "Nutty" is mainly an inimitable character with many positive qualities. He is a brilliant, mostly well-respected biologist capable of revolutionary discoveries. Sherman is cultured, polite, dignified, charismatic and gracious, even under the most trying circumstances. He lives in a respectable apartment. He has a loving, if outspoken, family. Actually, apart from his obesity (and the inevitable maladroitness that comes with it), Sherman's only real shortcoming is his shyness and lack of self-assertion, especially around women. Even so, when Sherman meets beautiful but demure Wellman College colleague Carla Purdy (Jada Pinkett-Smith), her demure demeanor somehow gives him the courage to ask her out on a date. Sherman's life seems complete. However, when Sherman and Carla attend a comedy show, and Sherman endures a withering (but funny) barrage of fat jokes by kamikaze comedian Reggie (Dave Chappelle), the hurt and humiliation compel Sherman into a fateful decision. Never one to whine about his lot, Sherman determinedly (and hilariously) has tried every conceivable regimen (diet, exercise, acupuncture) to lose the pounds. Eventually, he begins to make progress, but not quickly enough. However, the weight-reduction serum Sherman has been distilling and testing on hamsters will accelerate the process. So after the comedy club debacle, Sherman impulsively swigs some of the serum, which astoundingly transforms him into the svelte, dynamic Buddy Love (Eddie in "real life", without the padding). Trouble is, Sherman/Buddy may be more slender, but the serum somehow boosts his testosterone levels alarmingly so that the handsome stud also becomes insufferable, loud, and embarrassing. These qualities simultaneously attract and repel Carla and the audience. Buddy's abrasive manner isn't the only problem. It seems that the serum has only a temporary effect and tends to wear off at inopportune moments, such as when Buddy's transformation back to portly Sherman interrupts his date with Carla and eventually gets him wedged inside a Viper sports car. And so it progresses. With each Sherman/Buddy change and reversion, the audience slowly learns that, counter to what Sherman initially believes, fewer and fewer people prefer Buddy. In fact, the subconscious impermanence of the serum indicates, to me anyway, that Sherman really, and correctly, prefers himself to Buddy. However, alter ego Buddy soon shows his selfish monstrousness. With his devious talk, his promiscuity, and his plotting, Buddy causes Sherman to lose just about everything good in his life - job, home, a social life. Worst of all, Sherman will lose his very identity if Buddy manages to take two timed gulps of his formula to remain Buddy forever. Like Jekyll fighting Hyde, Sherman literally has to get his life back. At an ornate gala where a pharmaceutical manufacturer Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is expected to fund Sherman's college research, the fight does occur. After a titanic struggle, Sherman reclaims his body. Again, in a dignified heartfelt speech Sherman apologizes for the calamities, hurt, and chaos he has caused as Buddy and finally learns that you have to love and be comfortable with yourself. This candor impresses Harlan enough to make the grant, and charms Carla enough to accept a dance with Sherman. Funny thing about the fat jokes, comments, and slapstick throughout the movie - we laugh at them, but not at the person who endures them. Whether getting stuck in a chair or car, or erasing a blackboard with his belly, or getting chewed out by a venal, insulting, weaselly dean (Larry Miller) or struggling to walk up stairs or exercise, Sherman preserves his dignity and likability. We even wince a little, because such a nice, accomplished person should not have to put up with such misadventures. Through the laughter, we urge Sherman to find the courage, self-assertion, and self-love to get the happiness he deserves. Even his seemingly uncouth and raunchy family (most members played by the versatile Murphy himself) point him in that direction; they may be fat and flatulent and undisciplined, but they also love and accept themselves exactly as they are. In a distorted way, even Sherman's alter ego Buddy tries to urge Sherman forward. "No matter what, you got to strut!" And so Sherman ultimately does, because at heart, he was always a scholar and a gentleman.

    You know many films that come out today don't have a good moral to the story. Many of today's films lack a good message and are more about style then substance. You know those films with nothing but sex and violence; nothing good but the special effects that are really not so special anymore. This film however was made soon before the film industry went on it's downward spiral. Poor Sherman Klump. He works as a professor at a local college and he is looking for a way to lose weight. He comes up with a solution. A liquid that will progressively bring his weight down slowly. One day he meets a woman named Carla and he falls hard for her. He decides to take her out for a date. They end up at a Comedy Club called The Scream. While there they enjoy an evening of music. At some point however a heckler named Reggie who takes people from the audience and makes fun of their looks. Unfortunately Sherman knows whats going on and decides to get up and leave however the spotlight finds his butt and Reggie goes all out with his fat jokes. Sherman is saddened and goes home upset. He has a dream where he becomes really fat. Sherman wakes up frightened and decides that he is going to become thin once and for all. He goes to his lab and takes some of the solution. He ends up passing out and in the morning he wakes up super thin. This is where his life will take a serious turn for the worse. He decides that he is going to take the solution to take out Carla and try to impress her as an alias under Buddy Love. Carla likes him at first but one problem Sherman has is that the solution wears off after awhile and he has to take more to stay in his thin Buddy form. Another drawback of the solution is that his testosterone levels go through the roof when he takes it. Sherman is being overcome by his new counterpart Buddy and Buddy wants to take all the credit for the professors solution. Professor Klump is able to beat Buddy and admits to everyone that he was so obsessed with losing weight and fitting in that he lost track of what he really wanted to do which was to help people. Carla had no problem with Sherman even while he was fat and she really liked him for who he was. The Nutty Professor has some potty humor in it but it still has a great message. Be happy with who you are. Don't let the jerks get you down. I have to agree that fat people are one of the most made fun of today along with people gays. When will people start to become more caring about people's real beauty and stop worrying about self image? We need more movies like this today. Our society is becoming more concerned with looks more and more everyday. Even young girls are being targeted. This is a movie that shows where the real beauty is; inside and not out.

    Eddie Murphy's THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996) is one of the mainstream classics of the 1990s. It's a great comedy with an emotional center, focusing on a lonely, overweight college professor who falls in love with a beautiful grad student and takes an experimental formula to lose weight and become the kind of man the young lady would want. It's a twist on the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde story, with the formula bringing out a new personality in the scientist. Not that many viewers will care, but this update is a pretty faithful adaptation of Jerry Lewis's original 1963 film of the same name, in spirit at least. I've seen Lewis's film only once, but enjoyed it very much. In Lewis's version, the professor is almost grotesquely awkward and nerdy before being transformed into the suave hipster Buddy Love. This remake adds the weight loss angle, although the formula still makes Buddy Love a confident, smooth-talking ladies' man. The coolest guy in the room. Everyone knows that Eddie Murphy is inside the Sherman Klump fatsuit, although the makeup and Murphy's Sherman persona are very effective. Most people also know that Murphy plays the other members of the overweight Klump family as well, Sherman's mother, father, grandmother, and brother. Again the makeup jobs are great and Murphy brings each character to life. The famous dinner table scenes are comedic tours de force. What many people may not know is that Eddie Murphy also plays the white Richard Simmons-like fitness guru Lance Perkins. I know some people assumed it really was Richard Simmons, but it's Eddie Murphy again in heavy makeup. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR showcases Murphy's great talent for playing different characters. Jada Pinkett, best known today as the wife/mother in the Will Smith entertainment clan, plays the fetching young colleague who admires Professor Klump's work and steals his heart. Klump sets her up with his slimmed-down alter ego Buddy Love, though it becomes clear that Buddy is a self-centered monster who lacks the sensitivity and kindness that the girl admires in the professor. Meanwhile Buddy plots to destroy Sherman once and for all and take over his body on a more permanent basis. Larry Miller plays the villainous college dean, James Coburn plays a millionaire interested in contributing to the school, and a young Dave Chappelle plays an obnoxious stand-up comic. The movie has a mainstream comedy feel, with some hammy performances and a rather low-brow sense of humor. (The Klump family relies rather heavily on fart jokes.) The film is dated by its mid-'90s fashions and music scene and the digital visual effects are noticeably phony (though still effective). But the 1960s version is hopelessly dated as a product of another era, too. Movies can't help it sometimes. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR is a top of the line comedy with some great work by the chameleonic Eddie Murphy. The movie succeeds because it's a comedy with a heart. We sympathize with Sherman Klump. He's shy, self-conscious about his appearance, embarrassed by his outspoken family. The film has a "be yourself" message. This Jekyll & Hyde fable is a great concept, first realized by comedy legend Jerry Lewis and later updated for a whole new audience. I'm surprised other IMDb users have been so harsh with their ratings of this film.

    Like seriously this movie was so ******* hilarious I laughed at the fart jokes,and Eddie Murphy playing 7 CHARACTERS(he was the granny,the fitness instructor,the professor,Buddy Love,his mother,his father,and his brother,thanks to some special make up effects by Rick Baker who also did Susan Sarandon's transformation for Enchanted). The story is about a shy modest professor named Sherman Klumps,a man who is so shy to ask a girl on a date just because he is rather obese and his family are rather obese too. So since his a professor and all,he works on a formula that can turn obese people or obese animals into slim form. But when he tries it on himself he becomes the incredibly loud- mouthed,charming,womanizer,douch-bag Buddy Love. But when the girl that he fancy's(played by Will Smith's wife Jada Pinkett),he realizes that you have to accept who you are as a person no matter if your big or small. I know this film may offend people who are obese but for people who want a good laugh I recommend this film as I am a HUGE FAN of Eddie Murphy. Overall im giving it a 7/10

    Sherman Klump, is a brilliant and a very fat man. One day he meets a beautiful and charming woman named Carla Purty, and he falls in love with her. He is aware to the fact, though, that he is a clumsy fat guy, while she is a young gorgeous lady. This makes him feel depressed, but he finds the solution for his problem. He decides to drink a potion which he invented himself in his lab. The potion makes him everything he wanted to be. The new him, Buddy Love, is the perfect solution for Klump, in his opinion. But is that what Carla really wants........ Yes the film has plenty of fart jokes, and has been lambasted by. Any for being to in the toilets regarding the humour, but look deeper, and you have one of the most heartwarming comedies of the nineties, and a hilarious movie to boot. The scene in the club where Chapelle is heckling Klump, is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the movie, or really any comedy come to think of it, and this is down to the talent that Murphy has, yes he has made a few bombs the last few years, but this really shows his comic genius and great acting skills. The family scenes are brilliant and so funny, you really believe that all those characters are sitting round that table and interacting. Buddy Love surprisingly lets the film down. He starts off okay, but by the end he's just a pantomime villain who really really overacts. So all in all, it was a great return to form for Murphy, and like I've already said, proves that he is a really talented actor and comedian.

    I'll be very honest, i've only seen a few parts of this movie, but that was just enough, and I have 0 desire to watch the rest. This "Comedy" is just so unfunny and insulting to the intelligence! it consists of fart humour, and other unfunny garbage that people seem to find funny nowadays, which is just sad because there are many other comedy movies that are far funnier and superior but they seem to get overlooked nowadays. even sex lives of the potato men was more watchable compared to this. eddy murphy's career has already been ruined because he keeps starring in awful movies like this. overall, if you haven't seen this movie, avoid it, and pretend it doesn't exist, unless you're really that much of a masochist, or an idiot who laughs at unfunny fart humour.

    The Nutty Professor (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Hilarious remake of the Jerry Lewis film about the overweight Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) who comes up with a chemical that will turn anyone skinny overnight. Klump rushes the experiment on himself after an embarrassing night out and becomes the skinny but annoying Buddy Love (Murphy). At first Buddy thinks this is what he wants but the side effects quickly follow. I don't care what anyone says but Eddie Murphy should have won the Oscar for this film and yes I've seen all the nominations from that year. It's rather amazing to see what Murphy was able to do here, playing at least seven characters and making of them one of the most memorable you're ever going to see. I don't care who you are but when you see Sherman Klump you can't help but fall in love with the character and the way Murphy plays him is just something amazing to watch. Even the Buddy Love character is quite memorable and this doesn't even cover the Klump family that Murphy perfectly handles. Rick Baker also deserves a lot of credit for the special effects and these here have to be considered some of the greatest of his career. The film really does walk the line between hilarious comedy and some rather sad and dramatic moments. There's no question that the film really packs a punch no matter what it's trying to do. The story itself certainly comes with a message that's not preachy and I think Murphy really delivers it in a touching way. The one flaw with the film is that it breaks out of a realistic nature at times and especially with way too many fart jokes. Still, there's no question that this here is Murphy at his greatest and the Sherman character is just so great that you can't help but be won over by the film.

    Well, while it doesn't deny the necessity of self-improvement, it has the merit to assess the awareness of our specificity, our difference. And being aware of what we are stimulates the idea of our self-improvement as long as we keep aware of what we are not, and maybe the most important, what we can't and will never be. And the line between the incapability of this admittance and a low self-esteem is unfortunately, extremely thin. And "The Nutty Professor" is a wonderful comedy for its positive and insightful message about self-acceptance through a very sympathetic protagonist, Eddie Murphy as Professor Sherman Klump. Murphy perfectly diluted all his flamboyance and sometimes obnoxious flashiness in a sweet, gentle and likable character whose occupation besides teaching in college is to make DNA experiences on hamsters in order to find some medical solutions against obesity. Yet obesity doesn't seem to be an issue in his own life, not until he meets Carla Purty, his new colleague, played by the eye-pleasing Jada Pinckett Smith. Naturally, he falls in love, and we realize that we just meet Klump at a pivotal moment of his life, obesity became an issue. Tone-wise, Tom Shaydac's film finds the right balance between humor and sweetness. In one of the most hilarious cinematic family dinners, we meet the Klumps, a sight that works as a genetic alibi for Sherman's appearance. Eddie Murphy, who proved his chameleonic talent in such films as "Coming to America" is at the top of his game in "The Nutty Professor" where he's both a sweet and caring mother, a naughty Black mama, a mean-spirited blue-collar father, a superficial brother and Sherman Klump (the other character played by Murphy isn't featured in the scene, but you'd hardly recognize him as an Aerobic coach).

Whether he believed her or not is not the point, we can only sympathize with this good man, who wants this inner beauty to express itself.

Carla is not indifferent to Sherman and accepts the date unaware that it would lead to a disaster because the restaurant stars a stand-up comedian who roasts people in the audience. Maybe I should have mentioned that the film is the remake of a Jerry Lewis' classic, but I don't think it's necessary since I know both stories are different.

Like so many great comedies like "Groundhog Day" or "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", there is a heart in "The Nutty Professor" and Eddie Murphy's so powerful that I could feel the way he felt. When everybody was getting their share of mocking jokes, he knew his turn was coming, and he would have it pretty bad (Dave Chappelle did a great job as the mean-spirited Reggie by the way), so when he tries to go to the toilet but unfortunately finds himself in the spotlight, we know the worst is to come. Murphy is so good in that role that it was impossible for me to laugh at Reggie's jokes; I could feel Sherman's broken heart, the devastation not just from the jokes, but from the people's reactions. The following scene is almost a tear-jerker when Carla tries to console him, he hardly speaks, the man was victim of a bullying that was the culmination of all the violence he tacitly endured.

Now, is the personality of Buddy Love irritating? I think it's the perfect representation of the way we indirectly perceive ourselves, since Sherman has low self-esteem, Buddy has exceedingly high self-esteem, it's his strength, his attitude almost embodies the whole 'Macho Man' theme song. Eddie Murphy mocks his own character as if he was aware that sometimes, being over confident can flirt with mean spiritedness, and he's so 'himself' that he manages to make us appreciate Sherman even more and this is the film's greatest message. I myself- had some issues with my appearance, and used to tell myself that I would be the most confident guy in the world if I had glasses, or if I were a few inches taller, but the meaning of our lives is not to wait for physical criteria to be confident and certainly not to compare ourselves to others, because that's the negation of our own specificity, and our capacity to contribute to the world on our own. The climactic speech is something I could respond to, it's the beautiful coming to realization of a man who didn't value himself enough while he had all the reasons to. It's like Eddie Murphy acknowledging that there is this soft spot he too often hided, because everybody expected him to be the smart-ass streetwise guy.

    Eddie Murphy has a reputation in Hollywood of being hard to work with and his track record since the late 90's hasn't been a good one. It makes it hard to remember just what a comedy genius this guy used to be, and The Nutty Professor is a prime example of that. Nobody else could have pulled off this role and made this film as good as it was. It's always been kind of a stupid story, but Murphy played into that and turned it into something that both kids and adults would find funny. No matter what you think of Eddie Murphy, it is impossible not to laugh during this movie. The Nutty Professor is two hours of fun, and on top of that, it's a refershing kind of comedy that we don't really see much of anymore.

    Even though a vast majority of the human population (present company included) does not possess, shall we say, a Greco-Roman physique, we nevertheless often belittle and disregard the overweight as somehow inferior. In the movies, this hypocritical bias is even more extreme. If an overweight person is (seldom) portrayed in a movie (whether as a star or in a supporting role), he/she will be either slow-witted, ill-tempered, clumsy, lazy, or some combination of all four. Most often, the overweight person will be there for one-dimensional comic relief. Eddie Murphy's character Sherman Klump in "The Nutty Professor" (hereafter "Nutty") goes a long way to correct most, if not all, of the overweight movie stereotypes, and against those hostile odds present an admirable human being indeed. Actually, Sherman in "Nutty" is mainly an inimitable character with many positive qualities. He is a brilliant, mostly well-respected biologist capable of revolutionary discoveries. Sherman is cultured, polite, dignified, charismatic and gracious, even under the most trying circumstances. He lives in a respectable apartment. He has a loving, if outspoken, family. Actually, apart from his obesity (and the inevitable maladroitness that comes with it), Sherman's only real shortcoming is his shyness and lack of self-assertion, especially around women. Even so, when Sherman meets beautiful but demure Wellman College colleague Carla Purdy (Jada Pinkett-Smith), her demure demeanor somehow gives him the courage to ask her out on a date. Sherman's life seems complete. However, when Sherman and Carla attend a comedy show, and Sherman endures a withering (but funny) barrage of fat jokes by kamikaze comedian Reggie (Dave Chappelle), the hurt and humiliation compel Sherman into a fateful decision. Never one to whine about his lot, Sherman determinedly (and hilariously) has tried every conceivable regimen (diet, exercise, acupuncture) to lose the pounds. Eventually, he begins to make progress, but not quickly enough. However, the weight-reduction serum Sherman has been distilling and testing on hamsters will accelerate the process. So after the comedy club debacle, Sherman impulsively swigs some of the serum, which astoundingly transforms him into the svelte, dynamic Buddy Love (Eddie in "real life", without the padding). Trouble is, Sherman/Buddy may be more slender, but the serum somehow boosts his testosterone levels alarmingly so that the handsome stud also becomes insufferable, loud, and embarrassing. These qualities simultaneously attract and repel Carla and the audience. Buddy's abrasive manner isn't the only problem. It seems that the serum has only a temporary effect and tends to wear off at inopportune moments, such as when Buddy's transformation back to portly Sherman interrupts his date with Carla and eventually gets him wedged inside a Viper sports car. And so it progresses. With each Sherman/Buddy change and reversion, the audience slowly learns that, counter to what Sherman initially believes, fewer and fewer people prefer Buddy. In fact, the subconscious impermanence of the serum indicates, to me anyway, that Sherman really, and correctly, prefers himself to Buddy. However, alter ego Buddy soon shows his selfish monstrousness. With his devious talk, his promiscuity, and his plotting, Buddy causes Sherman to lose just about everything good in his life - job, home, a social life. Worst of all, Sherman will lose his very identity if Buddy manages to take two timed gulps of his formula to remain Buddy forever. Like Jekyll fighting Hyde, Sherman literally has to get his life back. At an ornate gala where a pharmaceutical manufacturer Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is expected to fund Sherman's college research, the fight does occur. After a titanic struggle, Sherman reclaims his body. Again, in a dignified heartfelt speech Sherman apologizes for the calamities, hurt, and chaos he has caused as Buddy and finally learns that you have to love and be comfortable with yourself. This candor impresses Harlan enough to make the grant, and charms Carla enough to accept a dance with Sherman. Funny thing about the fat jokes, comments, and slapstick throughout the movie - we laugh at them, but not at the person who endures them. Whether getting stuck in a chair or car, or erasing a blackboard with his belly, or getting chewed out by a venal, insulting, weaselly dean (Larry Miller) or struggling to walk up stairs or exercise, Sherman preserves his dignity and likability. We even wince a little, because such a nice, accomplished person should not have to put up with such misadventures. Through the laughter, we urge Sherman to find the courage, self-assertion, and self-love to get the happiness he deserves. Even his seemingly uncouth and raunchy family (most members played by the versatile Murphy himself) point him in that direction; they may be fat and flatulent and undisciplined, but they also love and accept themselves exactly as they are. In a distorted way, even Sherman's alter ego Buddy tries to urge Sherman forward. "No matter what, you got to strut!" And so Sherman ultimately does, because at heart, he was always a scholar and a gentleman.

    You know many films that come out today don't have a good moral to the story. Many of today's films lack a good message and are more about style then substance. You know those films with nothing but sex and violence; nothing good but the special effects that are really not so special anymore. This film however was made soon before the film industry went on it's downward spiral. Poor Sherman Klump. He works as a professor at a local college and he is looking for a way to lose weight. He comes up with a solution. A liquid that will progressively bring his weight down slowly. One day he meets a woman named Carla and he falls hard for her. He decides to take her out for a date. They end up at a Comedy Club called The Scream. While there they enjoy an evening of music. At some point however a heckler named Reggie who takes people from the audience and makes fun of their looks. Unfortunately Sherman knows whats going on and decides to get up and leave however the spotlight finds his butt and Reggie goes all out with his fat jokes. Sherman is saddened and goes home upset. He has a dream where he becomes really fat. Sherman wakes up frightened and decides that he is going to become thin once and for all. He goes to his lab and takes some of the solution. He ends up passing out and in the morning he wakes up super thin. This is where his life will take a serious turn for the worse. He decides that he is going to take the solution to take out Carla and try to impress her as an alias under Buddy Love. Carla likes him at first but one problem Sherman has is that the solution wears off after awhile and he has to take more to stay in his thin Buddy form. Another drawback of the solution is that his testosterone levels go through the roof when he takes it. Sherman is being overcome by his new counterpart Buddy and Buddy wants to take all the credit for the professors solution. Professor Klump is able to beat Buddy and admits to everyone that he was so obsessed with losing weight and fitting in that he lost track of what he really wanted to do which was to help people. Carla had no problem with Sherman even while he was fat and she really liked him for who he was. The Nutty Professor has some potty humor in it but it still has a great message. Be happy with who you are. Don't let the jerks get you down. I have to agree that fat people are one of the most made fun of today along with people gays. When will people start to become more caring about people's real beauty and stop worrying about self image? We need more movies like this today. Our society is becoming more concerned with looks more and more everyday. Even young girls are being targeted. This is a movie that shows where the real beauty is; inside and not out.

    Eddie Murphy's THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996) is one of the mainstream classics of the 1990s. It's a great comedy with an emotional center, focusing on a lonely, overweight college professor who falls in love with a beautiful grad student and takes an experimental formula to lose weight and become the kind of man the young lady would want. It's a twist on the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde story, with the formula bringing out a new personality in the scientist. Not that many viewers will care, but this update is a pretty faithful adaptation of Jerry Lewis's original 1963 film of the same name, in spirit at least. I've seen Lewis's film only once, but enjoyed it very much. In Lewis's version, the professor is almost grotesquely awkward and nerdy before being transformed into the suave hipster Buddy Love. This remake adds the weight loss angle, although the formula still makes Buddy Love a confident, smooth-talking ladies' man. The coolest guy in the room. Everyone knows that Eddie Murphy is inside the Sherman Klump fatsuit, although the makeup and Murphy's Sherman persona are very effective. Most people also know that Murphy plays the other members of the overweight Klump family as well, Sherman's mother, father, grandmother, and brother. Again the makeup jobs are great and Murphy brings each character to life. The famous dinner table scenes are comedic tours de force. What many people may not know is that Eddie Murphy also plays the white Richard Simmons-like fitness guru Lance Perkins. I know some people assumed it really was Richard Simmons, but it's Eddie Murphy again in heavy makeup. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR showcases Murphy's great talent for playing different characters. Jada Pinkett, best known today as the wife/mother in the Will Smith entertainment clan, plays the fetching young colleague who admires Professor Klump's work and steals his heart. Klump sets her up with his slimmed-down alter ego Buddy Love, though it becomes clear that Buddy is a self-centered monster who lacks the sensitivity and kindness that the girl admires in the professor. Meanwhile Buddy plots to destroy Sherman once and for all and take over his body on a more permanent basis. Larry Miller plays the villainous college dean, James Coburn plays a millionaire interested in contributing to the school, and a young Dave Chappelle plays an obnoxious stand-up comic. The movie has a mainstream comedy feel, with some hammy performances and a rather low-brow sense of humor. (The Klump family relies rather heavily on fart jokes.) The film is dated by its mid-'90s fashions and music scene and the digital visual effects are noticeably phony (though still effective). But the 1960s version is hopelessly dated as a product of another era, too. Movies can't help it sometimes. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR is a top of the line comedy with some great work by the chameleonic Eddie Murphy. The movie succeeds because it's a comedy with a heart. We sympathize with Sherman Klump. He's shy, self-conscious about his appearance, embarrassed by his outspoken family. The film has a "be yourself" message. This Jekyll & Hyde fable is a great concept, first realized by comedy legend Jerry Lewis and later updated for a whole new audience. I'm surprised other IMDb users have been so harsh with their ratings of this film.

    Like seriously this movie was so ******* hilarious I laughed at the fart jokes,and Eddie Murphy playing 7 CHARACTERS(he was the granny,the fitness instructor,the professor,Buddy Love,his mother,his father,and his brother,thanks to some special make up effects by Rick Baker who also did Susan Sarandon's transformation for Enchanted). The story is about a shy modest professor named Sherman Klumps,a man who is so shy to ask a girl on a date just because he is rather obese and his family are rather obese too. So since his a professor and all,he works on a formula that can turn obese people or obese animals into slim form. But when he tries it on himself he becomes the incredibly loud- mouthed,charming,womanizer,douch-bag Buddy Love. But when the girl that he fancy's(played by Will Smith's wife Jada Pinkett),he realizes that you have to accept who you are as a person no matter if your big or small. I know this film may offend people who are obese but for people who want a good laugh I recommend this film as I am a HUGE FAN of Eddie Murphy. Overall im giving it a 7/10

    Sherman Klump, is a brilliant and a very fat man. One day he meets a beautiful and charming woman named Carla Purty, and he falls in love with her. He is aware to the fact, though, that he is a clumsy fat guy, while she is a young gorgeous lady. This makes him feel depressed, but he finds the solution for his problem. He decides to drink a potion which he invented himself in his lab. The potion makes him everything he wanted to be. The new him, Buddy Love, is the perfect solution for Klump, in his opinion. But is that what Carla really wants........ Yes the film has plenty of fart jokes, and has been lambasted by. Any for being to in the toilets regarding the humour, but look deeper, and you have one of the most heartwarming comedies of the nineties, and a hilarious movie to boot. The scene in the club where Chapelle is heckling Klump, is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the movie, or really any comedy come to think of it, and this is down to the talent that Murphy has, yes he has made a few bombs the last few years, but this really shows his comic genius and great acting skills. The family scenes are brilliant and so funny, you really believe that all those characters are sitting round that table and interacting. Buddy Love surprisingly lets the film down. He starts off okay, but by the end he's just a pantomime villain who really really overacts. So all in all, it was a great return to form for Murphy, and like I've already said, proves that he is a really talented actor and comedian.

    I'll be very honest, i've only seen a few parts of this movie, but that was just enough, and I have 0 desire to watch the rest. This "Comedy" is just so unfunny and insulting to the intelligence! it consists of fart humour, and other unfunny garbage that people seem to find funny nowadays, which is just sad because there are many other comedy movies that are far funnier and superior but they seem to get overlooked nowadays. even sex lives of the potato men was more watchable compared to this. eddy murphy's career has already been ruined because he keeps starring in awful movies like this. overall, if you haven't seen this movie, avoid it, and pretend it doesn't exist, unless you're really that much of a masochist, or an idiot who laughs at unfunny fart humour.

    The Nutty Professor (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Hilarious remake of the Jerry Lewis film about the overweight Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) who comes up with a chemical that will turn anyone skinny overnight. Klump rushes the experiment on himself after an embarrassing night out and becomes the skinny but annoying Buddy Love (Murphy). At first Buddy thinks this is what he wants but the side effects quickly follow. I don't care what anyone says but Eddie Murphy should have won the Oscar for this film and yes I've seen all the nominations from that year. It's rather amazing to see what Murphy was able to do here, playing at least seven characters and making of them one of the most memorable you're ever going to see. I don't care who you are but when you see Sherman Klump you can't help but fall in love with the character and the way Murphy plays him is just something amazing to watch. Even the Buddy Love character is quite memorable and this doesn't even cover the Klump family that Murphy perfectly handles. Rick Baker also deserves a lot of credit for the special effects and these here have to be considered some of the greatest of his career. The film really does walk the line between hilarious comedy and some rather sad and dramatic moments. There's no question that the film really packs a punch no matter what it's trying to do. The story itself certainly comes with a message that's not preachy and I think Murphy really delivers it in a touching way. The one flaw with the film is that it breaks out of a realistic nature at times and especially with way too many fart jokes. Still, there's no question that this here is Murphy at his greatest and the Sherman character is just so great that you can't help but be won over by the film.

    Well, while it doesn't deny the necessity of self-improvement, it has the merit to assess the awareness of our specificity, our difference. And being aware of what we are stimulates the idea of our self-improvement as long as we keep aware of what we are not, and maybe the most important, what we can't and will never be. And the line between the incapability of this admittance and a low self-esteem is unfortunately, extremely thin. And "The Nutty Professor" is a wonderful comedy for its positive and insightful message about self-acceptance through a very sympathetic protagonist, Eddie Murphy as Professor Sherman Klump. Murphy perfectly diluted all his flamboyance and sometimes obnoxious flashiness in a sweet, gentle and likable character whose occupation besides teaching in college is to make DNA experiences on hamsters in order to find some medical solutions against obesity. Yet obesity doesn't seem to be an issue in his own life, not until he meets Carla Purty, his new colleague, played by the eye-pleasing Jada Pinckett Smith. Naturally, he falls in love, and we realize that we just meet Klump at a pivotal moment of his life, obesity became an issue. Tone-wise, Tom Shaydac's film finds the right balance between humor and sweetness. In one of the most hilarious cinematic family dinners, we meet the Klumps, a sight that works as a genetic alibi for Sherman's appearance. Eddie Murphy, who proved his chameleonic talent in such films as "Coming to America" is at the top of his game in "The Nutty Professor" where he's both a sweet and caring mother, a naughty Black mama, a mean-spirited blue-collar father, a superficial brother and Sherman Klump (the other character played by Murphy isn't featured in the scene, but you'd hardly recognize him as an Aerobic coach). The film, that won the Oscar for Best Make-Up, is the greatest credit to Murphy's talent when it comes to portray various characters. But there's more than discussions about weight and some farting contest in that dinner (always hilarious and never vulgar), the scene concludes with a beautiful exchange between Sherman and his mother. She loves him like any other mother, she sees both an inner and a physical beauty and we don't laugh at that. Whether he believed her or not is not the point, we can only sympathize with this good man, who wants this inner beauty to express itself. And when in the next scene, he asks Carla for a date, we understand Mama Klump found the right words to encourage her son to overcome his shyness. Carla is not indifferent to Sherman and accepts the date unaware that it would lead to a disaster because the restaurant stars a stand-up comedian who roasts people in the audience. Maybe I should have mentioned that the film is the remake of a Jerry Lewis' classic, but I don't think it's necessary since I know both stories are different. And I don't even think, the original is better just because it's the first one. All I know is I can more relate to a nerdy scientist who wants to be accepted by society than one who just wants to be a womanizer. Like so many great comedies like "Groundhog Day" or "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", there is a heart in "The Nutty Professor" and Eddie Murphy's so powerful that I could feel the way he felt. When everybody was getting their share of mocking jokes, he knew his turn was coming, and he would have it pretty bad (Dave Chappelle did a great job as the mean-spirited Reggie by the way), so when he tries to go to the toilet but unfortunately finds himself in the spotlight, we know the worst is to come. Murphy is so good in that role that it was impossible for me to laugh at Reggie's jokes; I could feel Sherman's broken heart, the devastation not just from the jokes, but from the people's reactions. The following scene is almost a tear-jerker when Carla tries to console him, he hardly speaks, the man was victim of a bullying that was the culmination of all the violence he tacitly endured. This is the pivotal moment where he decides to test his own researches on himself and become Buddy Love, a sort of Alpha Male who's got every thing a man can wish. Basically, Buddy Love is Eddie Murphy playing Eddie Murphy in the most irritating way, I missed Sherman Klump as soon as he disappeared but I forgive Buddy Love, if only for the magnificent revenge against Reggie, where the sprinkler became the sprinkled. Now, is the personality of Buddy Love irritating? I think it's the perfect representation of the way we indirectly perceive ourselves, since Sherman has low self-esteem, Buddy has exceedingly high self-esteem, it's his strength, his attitude almost embodies the whole 'Macho Man' theme song. Eddie Murphy mocks his own character as if he was aware that sometimes, being over confident can flirt with mean spiritedness, and he's so 'himself' that he manages to make us appreciate Sherman even more and this is the film's greatest message. I myself- had some issues with my appearance, and used to tell myself that I would be the most confident guy in the world if I had glasses, or if I were a few inches taller, but the meaning of our lives is not to wait for physical criteria to be confident and certainly not to compare ourselves to others, because that's the negation of our own specificity, and our capacity to contribute to the world on our own. The climactic speech is something I could respond to, it's the beautiful coming to realization of a man who didn't value himself enough while he had all the reasons to. It's like Eddie Murphy acknowledging that there is this soft spot he too often hided, because everybody expected him to be the smart-ass streetwise guy.

    Along with 'Beverly Hills Cop', it was the 'Nutty Professor' that cemented that signature Eddie Murphy smile as iconic. It's infectious and more often than not, serves to draw you more towards his characters. Although the protagonist is the sweet and unassuming Professor Klump, good old Eddie Murphy truly struts his stuff with the cocky, hyperactive alter ego, Buddy Love, the self proclaimed star of the show. The humour did, at times, descend to a very kiddish level with a comically obese man falling over and pushing things over, but the more mature hilarity really ensues with the 'embarassing family scenes', all the members of whom are portrayed by Murphy, underlining his prowess as a terrific multi character comedian regardless of age, gender or size. The chemistry between Murphy and Jada Pinkett was far from sizzling but Pinkett fulfilled the basic criteria of the love interest which allowed more attention to be shifted towards Murphy's two personas. A nice story which won't leave you in bouts of laughter upon finishing, but will bring more than a few throughout as you enjoy Eddie Murphy in his prime.

It seems that the serum has only a temporary effect and tends to wear off at inopportune moments, such as when Buddy's transformation back to portly Sherman interrupts his date with Carla and eventually gets him wedged inside a Viper sports car. And so it progresses. With each Sherman/Buddy change and reversion, the audience slowly learns that, counter to what Sherman initially believes, fewer and fewer people prefer Buddy.

We even wince a little, because such a nice, accomplished person should not have to put up with such misadventures. Through the laughter, we urge Sherman to find the courage, self-assertion, and self-love to get the happiness he deserves. Even his seemingly uncouth and raunchy family (most members played by the versatile Murphy himself) point him in that direction; they may be fat and flatulent and undisciplined, but they also love and accept themselves exactly as they are. In a distorted way, even Sherman's alter ego Buddy tries to urge Sherman forward. "No matter what, you got to strut!" And so Sherman ultimately does, because at heart, he was always a scholar and a gentleman.

    You know many films that come out today don't have a good moral to the story. Many of today's films lack a good message and are more about style then substance. You know those films with nothing but sex and violence; nothing good but the special effects that are really not so special anymore. This film however was made soon before the film industry went on it's downward spiral. Poor Sherman Klump. He works as a professor at a local college and he is looking for a way to lose weight. He comes up with a solution. A liquid that will progressively bring his weight down slowly. One day he meets a woman named Carla and he falls hard for her. He decides to take her out for a date. They end up at a Comedy Club called The Scream. While there they enjoy an evening of music. At some point however a heckler named Reggie who takes people from the audience and makes fun of their looks. Unfortunately Sherman knows whats going on and decides to get up and leave however the spotlight finds his butt and Reggie goes all out with his fat jokes. Sherman is saddened and goes home upset. He has a dream where he becomes really fat. Sherman wakes up frightened and decides that he is going to become thin once and for all. He goes to his lab and takes some of the solution. He ends up passing out and in the morning he wakes up super thin. This is where his life will take a serious turn for the worse. He decides that he is going to take the solution to take out Carla and try to impress her as an alias under Buddy Love. Carla likes him at first but one problem Sherman has is that the solution wears off after awhile and he has to take more to stay in his thin Buddy form. Another drawback of the solution is that his testosterone levels go through the roof when he takes it. Sherman is being overcome by his new counterpart Buddy and Buddy wants to take all the credit for the professors solution. Professor Klump is able to beat Buddy and admits to everyone that he was so obsessed with losing weight and fitting in that he lost track of what he really wanted to do which was to help people. Carla had no problem with Sherman even while he was fat and she really liked him for who he was. The Nutty Professor has some potty humor in it but it still has a great message. Be happy with who you are. Don't let the jerks get you down. I have to agree that fat people are one of the most made fun of today along with people gays. When will people start to become more caring about people's real beauty and stop worrying about self image? We need more movies like this today. Our society is becoming more concerned with looks more and more everyday. Even young girls are being targeted. This is a movie that shows where the real beauty is; inside and not out.

    Eddie Murphy's THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996) is one of the mainstream classics of the 1990s. It's a great comedy with an emotional center, focusing on a lonely, overweight college professor who falls in love with a beautiful grad student and takes an experimental formula to lose weight and become the kind of man the young lady would want. It's a twist on the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde story, with the formula bringing out a new personality in the scientist. Not that many viewers will care, but this update is a pretty faithful adaptation of Jerry Lewis's original 1963 film of the same name, in spirit at least. I've seen Lewis's film only once, but enjoyed it very much. In Lewis's version, the professor is almost grotesquely awkward and nerdy before being transformed into the suave hipster Buddy Love. This remake adds the weight loss angle, although the formula still makes Buddy Love a confident, smooth-talking ladies' man. The coolest guy in the room. Everyone knows that Eddie Murphy is inside the Sherman Klump fatsuit, although the makeup and Murphy's Sherman persona are very effective. Most people also know that Murphy plays the other members of the overweight Klump family as well, Sherman's mother, father, grandmother, and brother. Again the makeup jobs are great and Murphy brings each character to life. The famous dinner table scenes are comedic tours de force. What many people may not know is that Eddie Murphy also plays the white Richard Simmons-like fitness guru Lance Perkins. I know some people assumed it really was Richard Simmons, but it's Eddie Murphy again in heavy makeup. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR showcases Murphy's great talent for playing different characters. Jada Pinkett, best known today as the wife/mother in the Will Smith entertainment clan, plays the fetching young colleague who admires Professor Klump's work and steals his heart. Klump sets her up with his slimmed-down alter ego Buddy Love, though it becomes clear that Buddy is a self-centered monster who lacks the sensitivity and kindness that the girl admires in the professor. Meanwhile Buddy plots to destroy Sherman once and for all and take over his body on a more permanent basis. Larry Miller plays the villainous college dean, James Coburn plays a millionaire interested in contributing to the school, and a young Dave Chappelle plays an obnoxious stand-up comic. The movie has a mainstream comedy feel, with some hammy performances and a rather low-brow sense of humor. (The Klump family relies rather heavily on fart jokes.) The film is dated by its mid-'90s fashions and music scene and the digital visual effects are noticeably phony (though still effective). But the 1960s version is hopelessly dated as a product of another era, too. Movies can't help it sometimes. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR is a top of the line comedy with some great work by the chameleonic Eddie Murphy. The movie succeeds because it's a comedy with a heart. We sympathize with Sherman Klump. He's shy, self-conscious about his appearance, embarrassed by his outspoken family. The film has a "be yourself" message. This Jekyll & Hyde fable is a great concept, first realized by comedy legend Jerry Lewis and later updated for a whole new audience. I'm surprised other IMDb users have been so harsh with their ratings of this film.

    Like seriously this movie was so ******* hilarious I laughed at the fart jokes,and Eddie Murphy playing 7 CHARACTERS(he was the granny,the fitness instructor,the professor,Buddy Love,his mother,his father,and his brother,thanks to some special make up effects by Rick Baker who also did Susan Sarandon's transformation for Enchanted). The story is about a shy modest professor named Sherman Klumps,a man who is so shy to ask a girl on a date just because he is rather obese and his family are rather obese too. So since his a professor and all,he works on a formula that can turn obese people or obese animals into slim form. But when he tries it on himself he becomes the incredibly loud- mouthed,charming,womanizer,douch-bag Buddy Love. But when the girl that he fancy's(played by Will Smith's wife Jada Pinkett),he realizes that you have to accept who you are as a person no matter if your big or small. I know this film may offend people who are obese but for people who want a good laugh I recommend this film as I am a HUGE FAN of Eddie Murphy. Overall im giving it a 7/10

    Sherman Klump, is a brilliant and a very fat man. One day he meets a beautiful and charming woman named Carla Purty, and he falls in love with her. He is aware to the fact, though, that he is a clumsy fat guy, while she is a young gorgeous lady. This makes him feel depressed, but he finds the solution for his problem. He decides to drink a potion which he invented himself in his lab. The potion makes him everything he wanted to be. The new him, Buddy Love, is the perfect solution for Klump, in his opinion. But is that what Carla really wants........ Yes the film has plenty of fart jokes, and has been lambasted by. Any for being to in the toilets regarding the humour, but look deeper, and you have one of the most heartwarming comedies of the nineties, and a hilarious movie to boot. The scene in the club where Chapelle is heckling Klump, is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the movie, or really any comedy come to think of it, and this is down to the talent that Murphy has, yes he has made a few bombs the last few years, but this really shows his comic genius and great acting skills. The family scenes are brilliant and so funny, you really believe that all those characters are sitting round that table and interacting. Buddy Love surprisingly lets the film down. He starts off okay, but by the end he's just a pantomime villain who really really overacts. So all in all, it was a great return to form for Murphy, and like I've already said, proves that he is a really talented actor and comedian.

    I'll be very honest, i've only seen a few parts of this movie, but that was just enough, and I have 0 desire to watch the rest. This "Comedy" is just so unfunny and insulting to the intelligence! it consists of fart humour, and other unfunny garbage that people seem to find funny nowadays, which is just sad because there are many other comedy movies that are far funnier and superior but they seem to get overlooked nowadays. even sex lives of the potato men was more watchable compared to this. eddy murphy's career has already been ruined because he keeps starring in awful movies like this. overall, if you haven't seen this movie, avoid it, and pretend it doesn't exist, unless you're really that much of a masochist, or an idiot who laughs at unfunny fart humour.

    The Nutty Professor (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Hilarious remake of the Jerry Lewis film about the overweight Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) who comes up with a chemical that will turn anyone skinny overnight. Klump rushes the experiment on himself after an embarrassing night out and becomes the skinny but annoying Buddy Love (Murphy). At first Buddy thinks this is what he wants but the side effects quickly follow. I don't care what anyone says but Eddie Murphy should have won the Oscar for this film and yes I've seen all the nominations from that year. It's rather amazing to see what Murphy was able to do here, playing at least seven characters and making of them one of the most memorable you're ever going to see. I don't care who you are but when you see Sherman Klump you can't help but fall in love with the character and the way Murphy plays him is just something amazing to watch. Even the Buddy Love character is quite memorable and this doesn't even cover the Klump family that Murphy perfectly handles. Rick Baker also deserves a lot of credit for the special effects and these here have to be considered some of the greatest of his career. The film really does walk the line between hilarious comedy and some rather sad and dramatic moments. There's no question that the film really packs a punch no matter what it's trying to do. The story itself certainly comes with a message that's not preachy and I think Murphy really delivers it in a touching way. The one flaw with the film is that it breaks out of a realistic nature at times and especially with way too many fart jokes. Still, there's no question that this here is Murphy at his greatest and the Sherman character is just so great that you can't help but be won over by the film.

    Well, while it doesn't deny the necessity of self-improvement, it has the merit to assess the awareness of our specificity, our difference. And being aware of what we are stimulates the idea of our self-improvement as long as we keep aware of what we are not, and maybe the most important, what we can't and will never be. And the line between the incapability of this admittance and a low self-esteem is unfortunately, extremely thin. And "The Nutty Professor" is a wonderful comedy for its positive and insightful message about self-acceptance through a very sympathetic protagonist, Eddie Murphy as Professor Sherman Klump. Murphy perfectly diluted all his flamboyance and sometimes obnoxious flashiness in a sweet, gentle and likable character whose occupation besides teaching in college is to make DNA experiences on hamsters in order to find some medical solutions against obesity. Yet obesity doesn't seem to be an issue in his own life, not until he meets Carla Purty, his new colleague, played by the eye-pleasing Jada Pinckett Smith. Naturally, he falls in love, and we realize that we just meet Klump at a pivotal moment of his life, obesity became an issue. Tone-wise, Tom Shaydac's film finds the right balance between humor and sweetness. In one of the most hilarious cinematic family dinners, we meet the Klumps, a sight that works as a genetic alibi for Sherman's appearance. Eddie Murphy, who proved his chameleonic talent in such films as "Coming to America" is at the top of his game in "The Nutty Professor" where he's both a sweet and caring mother, a naughty Black mama, a mean-spirited blue-collar father, a superficial brother and Sherman Klump (the other character played by Murphy isn't featured in the scene, but you'd hardly recognize him as an Aerobic coach). The film, that won the Oscar for Best Make-Up, is the greatest credit to Murphy's talent when it comes to portray various characters. But there's more than discussions about weight and some farting contest in that dinner (always hilarious and never vulgar), the scene concludes with a beautiful exchange between Sherman and his mother. She loves him like any other mother, she sees both an inner and a physical beauty and we don't laugh at that. Whether he believed her or not is not the point, we can only sympathize with this good man, who wants this inner beauty to express itself. And when in the next scene, he asks Carla for a date, we understand Mama Klump found the right words to encourage her son to overcome his shyness. Carla is not indifferent to Sherman and accepts the date unaware that it would lead to a disaster because the restaurant stars a stand-up comedian who roasts people in the audience. Maybe I should have mentioned that the film is the remake of a Jerry Lewis' classic, but I don't think it's necessary since I know both stories are different. And I don't even think, the original is better just because it's the first one. All I know is I can more relate to a nerdy scientist who wants to be accepted by society than one who just wants to be a womanizer. Like so many great comedies like "Groundhog Day" or "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", there is a heart in "The Nutty Professor" and Eddie Murphy's so powerful that I could feel the way he felt. When everybody was getting their share of mocking jokes, he knew his turn was coming, and he would have it pretty bad (Dave Chappelle did a great job as the mean-spirited Reggie by the way), so when he tries to go to the toilet but unfortunately finds himself in the spotlight, we know the worst is to come. Murphy is so good in that role that it was impossible for me to laugh at Reggie's jokes; I could feel Sherman's broken heart, the devastation not just from the jokes, but from the people's reactions. The following scene is almost a tear-jerker when Carla tries to console him, he hardly speaks, the man was victim of a bullying that was the culmination of all the violence he tacitly endured. This is the pivotal moment where he decides to test his own researches on himself and become Buddy Love, a sort of Alpha Male who's got every thing a man can wish. Basically, Buddy Love is Eddie Murphy playing Eddie Murphy in the most irritating way, I missed Sherman Klump as soon as he disappeared but I forgive Buddy Love, if only for the magnificent revenge against Reggie, where the sprinkler became the sprinkled. Now, is the personality of Buddy Love irritating? I think it's the perfect representation of the way we indirectly perceive ourselves, since Sherman has low self-esteem, Buddy has exceedingly high self-esteem, it's his strength, his attitude almost embodies the whole 'Macho Man' theme song. Eddie Murphy mocks his own character as if he was aware that sometimes, being over confident can flirt with mean spiritedness, and he's so 'himself' that he manages to make us appreciate Sherman even more and this is the film's greatest message. I myself- had some issues with my appearance, and used to tell myself that I would be the most confident guy in the world if I had glasses, or if I were a few inches taller, but the meaning of our lives is not to wait for physical criteria to be confident and certainly not to compare ourselves to others, because that's the negation of our own specificity, and our capacity to contribute to the world on our own. The climactic speech is something I could respond to, it's the beautiful coming to realization of a man who didn't value himself enough while he had all the reasons to. It's like Eddie Murphy acknowledging that there is this soft spot he too often hided, because everybody expected him to be the smart-ass streetwise guy.

    Along with 'Beverly Hills Cop', it was the 'Nutty Professor' that cemented that signature Eddie Murphy smile as iconic. It's infectious and more often than not, serves to draw you more towards his characters. Although the protagonist is the sweet and unassuming Professor Klump, good old Eddie Murphy truly struts his stuff with the cocky, hyperactive alter ego, Buddy Love, the self proclaimed star of the show. The humour did, at times, descend to a very kiddish level with a comically obese man falling over and pushing things over, but the more mature hilarity really ensues with the 'embarassing family scenes', all the members of whom are portrayed by Murphy, underlining his prowess as a terrific multi character comedian regardless of age, gender or size. The chemistry between Murphy and Jada Pinkett was far from sizzling but Pinkett fulfilled the basic criteria of the love interest which allowed more attention to be shifted towards Murphy's two personas. A nice story which won't leave you in bouts of laughter upon finishing, but will bring more than a few throughout as you enjoy Eddie Murphy in his prime.

    Eddie Murphy has a reputation in Hollywood of being hard to work with and his track record since the late 90's hasn't been a good one. It makes it hard to remember just what a comedy genius this guy used to be, and The Nutty Professor is a prime example of that. Nobody else could have pulled off this role and made this film as good as it was. It's always been kind of a stupid story, but Murphy played into that and turned it into something that both kids and adults would find funny. No matter what you think of Eddie Murphy, it is impossible not to laugh during this movie. The Nutty Professor is two hours of fun, and on top of that, it's a refershing kind of comedy that we don't really see much of anymore.

    No (Fat) Joke, Sherman Klump is a Scholar and a Gentleman

    Even though a vast majority of the human population (present company included) does not possess, shall we say, a Greco-Roman physique, we nevertheless often belittle and disregard the overweight as somehow inferior. In the movies, this hypocritical bias is even more extreme. If an overweight person is (seldom) portrayed in a movie (whether as a star or in a supporting role), he/she will be either slow-witted, ill-tempered, clumsy, lazy, or some combination of all four. Most often, the overweight person will be there for one-dimensional comic relief. Eddie Murphy's character Sherman Klump in "The Nutty Professor" (hereafter "Nutty") goes a long way to correct most, if not all, of the overweight movie stereotypes, and against those hostile odds present an admirable human being indeed. Actually, Sherman in "Nutty" is mainly an inimitable character with many positive qualities. He is a brilliant, mostly well-respected biologist capable of revolutionary discoveries. Sherman is cultured, polite, dignified, charismatic and gracious, even under the most trying circumstances. He lives in a respectable apartment. He has a loving, if outspoken, family. Actually, apart from his obesity (and the inevitable maladroitness that comes with it), Sherman's only real shortcoming is his shyness and lack of self-assertion, especially around women. Even so, when Sherman meets beautiful but demure Wellman College colleague Carla Purdy (Jada Pinkett-Smith), her demure demeanor somehow gives him the courage to ask her out on a date. Sherman's life seems complete. However, when Sherman and Carla attend a comedy show, and Sherman endures a withering (but funny) barrage of fat jokes by kamikaze comedian Reggie (Dave Chappelle), the hurt and humiliation compel Sherman into a fateful decision. Never one to whine about his lot, Sherman determinedly (and hilariously) has tried every conceivable regimen (diet, exercise, acupuncture) to lose the pounds. Eventually, he begins to make progress, but not quickly enough. However, the weight-reduction serum Sherman has been distilling and testing on hamsters will accelerate the process. So after the comedy club debacle, Sherman impulsively swigs some of the serum, which astoundingly transforms him into the svelte, dynamic Buddy Love (Eddie in "real life", without the padding). Trouble is, Sherman/Buddy may be more slender, but the serum somehow boosts his testosterone levels alarmingly so that the handsome stud also becomes insufferable, loud, and embarrassing. These qualities simultaneously attract and repel Carla and the audience. Buddy's abrasive manner isn't the only problem. It seems that the serum has only a temporary effect and tends to wear off at inopportune moments, such as when Buddy's transformation back to portly Sherman interrupts his date with Carla and eventually gets him wedged inside a Viper sports car. And so it progresses. With each Sherman/Buddy change and reversion, the audience slowly learns that, counter to what Sherman initially believes, fewer and fewer people prefer Buddy. In fact, the subconscious impermanence of the serum indicates, to me anyway, that Sherman really, and correctly, prefers himself to Buddy. However, alter ego Buddy soon shows his selfish monstrousness. With his devious talk, his promiscuity, and his plotting, Buddy causes Sherman to lose just about everything good in his life - job, home, a social life. Worst of all, Sherman will lose his very identity if Buddy manages to take two timed gulps of his formula to remain Buddy forever. Like Jekyll fighting Hyde, Sherman literally has to get his life back. At an ornate gala where a pharmaceutical manufacturer Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is expected to fund Sherman's college research, the fight does occur. After a titanic struggle, Sherman reclaims his body. Again, in a dignified heartfelt speech Sherman apologizes for the calamities, hurt, and chaos he has caused as Buddy and finally learns that you have to love and be comfortable with yourself. This candor impresses Harlan enough to make the grant, and charms Carla enough to accept a dance with Sherman. Funny thing about the fat jokes, comments, and slapstick throughout the movie - we laugh at them, but not at the person who endures them. Whether getting stuck in a chair or car, or erasing a blackboard with his belly, or getting chewed out by a venal, insulting, weaselly dean (Larry Miller) or struggling to walk up stairs or exercise, Sherman preserves his dignity and likability. We even wince a little, because such a nice, accomplished person should not have to put up with such misadventures. Through the laughter, we urge Sherman to find the courage, self-assertion, and self-love to get the happiness he deserves. Even his seemingly uncouth and raunchy family (most members played by the versatile Murphy himself) point him in that direction; they may be fat and flatulent and undisciplined, but they also love and accept themselves exactly as they are. In a distorted way, even Sherman's alter ego Buddy tries to urge Sherman forward. "No matter what, you got to strut!" And so Sherman ultimately does, because at heart, he was always a scholar and a gentleman.

    You know many films that come out today don't have a good moral to the story. Many of today's films lack a good message and are more about style then substance. You know those films with nothing but sex and violence; nothing good but the special effects that are really not so special anymore. This film however was made soon before the film industry went on it's downward spiral. Poor Sherman Klump. He works as a professor at a local college and he is looking for a way to lose weight.

He decides that he is going to take the solution to take out Carla and try to impress her as an alias under Buddy Love.

Another drawback of the solution is that his testosterone levels go through the roof when he takes it.

Professor Klump is able to beat Buddy and admits to everyone that he was so obsessed with losing weight and fitting in that he lost track of what he really wanted to do which was to help people.

Be happy with who you are. Don't let the jerks get you down. I have to agree that fat people are one of the most made fun of today along with people gays.

    Like seriously this movie was so ******* hilarious I laughed at the fart jokes,and Eddie Murphy playing 7 CHARACTERS(he was the granny,the fitness instructor,the professor,Buddy Love,his mother,his father,and his brother,thanks to some special make up effects by Rick Baker who also did Susan Sarandon's transformation for Enchanted). The story is about a shy modest professor named Sherman Klumps,a man who is so shy to ask a girl on a date just because he is rather obese and his family are rather obese too. So since his a professor and all,he works on a formula that can turn obese people or obese animals into slim form. But when he tries it on himself he becomes the incredibly loud- mouthed,charming,womanizer,douch-bag Buddy Love. But when the girl that he fancy's(played by Will Smith's wife Jada Pinkett),he realizes that you have to accept who you are as a person no matter if your big or small. I know this film may offend people who are obese but for people who want a good laugh I recommend this film as I am a HUGE FAN of Eddie Murphy. Overall im giving it a 7/10

    Sherman Klump, is a brilliant and a very fat man. One day he meets a beautiful and charming woman named Carla Purty, and he falls in love with her. He is aware to the fact, though, that he is a clumsy fat guy, while she is a young gorgeous lady. This makes him feel depressed, but he finds the solution for his problem. He decides to drink a potion which he invented himself in his lab. The potion makes him everything he wanted to be. The new him, Buddy Love, is the perfect solution for Klump, in his opinion. But is that what Carla really wants........ Yes the film has plenty of fart jokes, and has been lambasted by. Any for being to in the toilets regarding the humour, but look deeper, and you have one of the most heartwarming comedies of the nineties, and a hilarious movie to boot. The scene in the club where Chapelle is heckling Klump, is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the movie, or really any comedy come to think of it, and this is down to the talent that Murphy has, yes he has made a few bombs the last few years, but this really shows his comic genius and great acting skills. The family scenes are brilliant and so funny, you really believe that all those characters are sitting round that table and interacting. Buddy Love surprisingly lets the film down. He starts off okay, but by the end he's just a pantomime villain who really really overacts. So all in all, it was a great return to form for Murphy, and like I've already said, proves that he is a really talented actor and comedian.

    I'll be very honest, i've only seen a few parts of this movie, but that was just enough, and I have 0 desire to watch the rest. This "Comedy" is just so unfunny and insulting to the intelligence! it consists of fart humour, and other unfunny garbage that people seem to find funny nowadays, which is just sad because there are many other comedy movies that are far funnier and superior but they seem to get overlooked nowadays. even sex lives of the potato men was more watchable compared to this. eddy murphy's career has already been ruined because he keeps starring in awful movies like this. overall, if you haven't seen this movie, avoid it, and pretend it doesn't exist, unless you're really that much of a masochist, or an idiot who laughs at unfunny fart humour.

    The Nutty Professor (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Hilarious remake of the Jerry Lewis film about the overweight Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) who comes up with a chemical that will turn anyone skinny overnight. Klump rushes the experiment on himself after an embarrassing night out and becomes the skinny but annoying Buddy Love (Murphy). At first Buddy thinks this is what he wants but the side effects quickly follow. I don't care what anyone says but Eddie Murphy should have won the Oscar for this film and yes I've seen all the nominations from that year. It's rather amazing to see what Murphy was able to do here, playing at least seven characters and making of them one of the most memorable you're ever going to see. I don't care who you are but when you see Sherman Klump you can't help but fall in love with the character and the way Murphy plays him is just something amazing to watch. Even the Buddy Love character is quite memorable and this doesn't even cover the Klump family that Murphy perfectly handles. Rick Baker also deserves a lot of credit for the special effects and these here have to be considered some of the greatest of his career. The film really does walk the line between hilarious comedy and some rather sad and dramatic moments. There's no question that the film really packs a punch no matter what it's trying to do. The story itself certainly comes with a message that's not preachy and I think Murphy really delivers it in a touching way. The one flaw with the film is that it breaks out of a realistic nature at times and especially with way too many fart jokes. Still, there's no question that this here is Murphy at his greatest and the Sherman character is just so great that you can't help but be won over by the film.

    Well, while it doesn't deny the necessity of self-improvement, it has the merit to assess the awareness of our specificity, our difference. And being aware of what we are stimulates the idea of our self-improvement as long as we keep aware of what we are not, and maybe the most important, what we can't and will never be. And the line between the incapability of this admittance and a low self-esteem is unfortunately, extremely thin. And "The Nutty Professor" is a wonderful comedy for its positive and insightful message about self-acceptance through a very sympathetic protagonist, Eddie Murphy as Professor Sherman Klump. Murphy perfectly diluted all his flamboyance and sometimes obnoxious flashiness in a sweet, gentle and likable character whose occupation besides teaching in college is to make DNA experiences on hamsters in order to find some medical solutions against obesity. Yet obesity doesn't seem to be an issue in his own life, not until he meets Carla Purty, his new colleague, played by the eye-pleasing Jada Pinckett Smith. Naturally, he falls in love, and we realize that we just meet Klump at a pivotal moment of his life, obesity became an issue. Tone-wise, Tom Shaydac's film finds the right balance between humor and sweetness. In one of the most hilarious cinematic family dinners, we meet the Klumps, a sight that works as a genetic alibi for Sherman's appearance. Eddie Murphy, who proved his chameleonic talent in such films as "Coming to America" is at the top of his game in "The Nutty Professor" where he's both a sweet and caring mother, a naughty Black mama, a mean-spirited blue-collar father, a superficial brother and Sherman Klump (the other character played by Murphy isn't featured in the scene, but you'd hardly recognize him as an Aerobic coach). The film, that won the Oscar for Best Make-Up, is the greatest credit to Murphy's talent when it comes to portray various characters. But there's more than discussions about weight and some farting contest in that dinner (always hilarious and never vulgar), the scene concludes with a beautiful exchange between Sherman and his mother. She loves him like any other mother, she sees both an inner and a physical beauty and we don't laugh at that. Whether he believed her or not is not the point, we can only sympathize with this good man, who wants this inner beauty to express itself. And when in the next scene, he asks Carla for a date, we understand Mama Klump found the right words to encourage her son to overcome his shyness. Carla is not indifferent to Sherman and accepts the date unaware that it would lead to a disaster because the restaurant stars a stand-up comedian who roasts people in the audience. Maybe I should have mentioned that the film is the remake of a Jerry Lewis' classic, but I don't think it's necessary since I know both stories are different. And I don't even think, the original is better just because it's the first one. All I know is I can more relate to a nerdy scientist who wants to be accepted by society than one who just wants to be a womanizer. Like so many great comedies like "Groundhog Day" or "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", there is a heart in "The Nutty Professor" and Eddie Murphy's so powerful that I could feel the way he felt. When everybody was getting their share of mocking jokes, he knew his turn was coming, and he would have it pretty bad (Dave Chappelle did a great job as the mean-spirited Reggie by the way), so when he tries to go to the toilet but unfortunately finds himself in the spotlight, we know the worst is to come. Murphy is so good in that role that it was impossible for me to laugh at Reggie's jokes; I could feel Sherman's broken heart, the devastation not just from the jokes, but from the people's reactions. The following scene is almost a tear-jerker when Carla tries to console him, he hardly speaks, the man was victim of a bullying that was the culmination of all the violence he tacitly endured. This is the pivotal moment where he decides to test his own researches on himself and become Buddy Love, a sort of Alpha Male who's got every thing a man can wish. Basically, Buddy Love is Eddie Murphy playing Eddie Murphy in the most irritating way, I missed Sherman Klump as soon as he disappeared but I forgive Buddy Love, if only for the magnificent revenge against Reggie, where the sprinkler became the sprinkled. Now, is the personality of Buddy Love irritating? I think it's the perfect representation of the way we indirectly perceive ourselves, since Sherman has low self-esteem, Buddy has exceedingly high self-esteem, it's his strength, his attitude almost embodies the whole 'Macho Man' theme song. Eddie Murphy mocks his own character as if he was aware that sometimes, being over confident can flirt with mean spiritedness, and he's so 'himself' that he manages to make us appreciate Sherman even more and this is the film's greatest message. I myself- had some issues with my appearance, and used to tell myself that I would be the most confident guy in the world if I had glasses, or if I were a few inches taller, but the meaning of our lives is not to wait for physical criteria to be confident and certainly not to compare ourselves to others, because that's the negation of our own specificity, and our capacity to contribute to the world on our own. The climactic speech is something I could respond to, it's the beautiful coming to realization of a man who didn't value himself enough while he had all the reasons to. It's like Eddie Murphy acknowledging that there is this soft spot he too often hided, because everybody expected him to be the smart-ass streetwise guy.

    Along with 'Beverly Hills Cop', it was the 'Nutty Professor' that cemented that signature Eddie Murphy smile as iconic. It's infectious and more often than not, serves to draw you more towards his characters. Although the protagonist is the sweet and unassuming Professor Klump, good old Eddie Murphy truly struts his stuff with the cocky, hyperactive alter ego, Buddy Love, the self proclaimed star of the show. The humour did, at times, descend to a very kiddish level with a comically obese man falling over and pushing things over, but the more mature hilarity really ensues with the 'embarassing family scenes', all the members of whom are portrayed by Murphy, underlining his prowess as a terrific multi character comedian regardless of age, gender or size. The chemistry between Murphy and Jada Pinkett was far from sizzling but Pinkett fulfilled the basic criteria of the love interest which allowed more attention to be shifted towards Murphy's two personas. A nice story which won't leave you in bouts of laughter upon finishing, but will bring more than a few throughout as you enjoy Eddie Murphy in his prime.

    Eddie Murphy has a reputation in Hollywood of being hard to work with and his track record since the late 90's hasn't been a good one. It makes it hard to remember just what a comedy genius this guy used to be, and The Nutty Professor is a prime example of that. Nobody else could have pulled off this role and made this film as good as it was. It's always been kind of a stupid story, but Murphy played into that and turned it into something that both kids and adults would find funny. No matter what you think of Eddie Murphy, it is impossible not to laugh during this movie. The Nutty Professor is two hours of fun, and on top of that, it's a refershing kind of comedy that we don't really see much of anymore.

    No (Fat) Joke, Sherman Klump is a Scholar and a Gentleman

    Even though a vast majority of the human population (present company included) does not possess, shall we say, a Greco-Roman physique, we nevertheless often belittle and disregard the overweight as somehow inferior. In the movies, this hypocritical bias is even more extreme. If an overweight person is (seldom) portrayed in a movie (whether as a star or in a supporting role), he/she will be either slow-witted, ill-tempered, clumsy, lazy, or some combination of all four. Most often, the overweight person will be there for one-dimensional comic relief. Eddie Murphy's character Sherman Klump in "The Nutty Professor" (hereafter "Nutty") goes a long way to correct most, if not all, of the overweight movie stereotypes, and against those hostile odds present an admirable human being indeed. Actually, Sherman in "Nutty" is mainly an inimitable character with many positive qualities. He is a brilliant, mostly well-respected biologist capable of revolutionary discoveries. Sherman is cultured, polite, dignified, charismatic and gracious, even under the most trying circumstances. He lives in a respectable apartment. He has a loving, if outspoken, family. Actually, apart from his obesity (and the inevitable maladroitness that comes with it), Sherman's only real shortcoming is his shyness and lack of self-assertion, especially around women. Even so, when Sherman meets beautiful but demure Wellman College colleague Carla Purdy (Jada Pinkett-Smith), her demure demeanor somehow gives him the courage to ask her out on a date. Sherman's life seems complete. However, when Sherman and Carla attend a comedy show, and Sherman endures a withering (but funny) barrage of fat jokes by kamikaze comedian Reggie (Dave Chappelle), the hurt and humiliation compel Sherman into a fateful decision. Never one to whine about his lot, Sherman determinedly (and hilariously) has tried every conceivable regimen (diet, exercise, acupuncture) to lose the pounds. Eventually, he begins to make progress, but not quickly enough. However, the weight-reduction serum Sherman has been distilling and testing on hamsters will accelerate the process. So after the comedy club debacle, Sherman impulsively swigs some of the serum, which astoundingly transforms him into the svelte, dynamic Buddy Love (Eddie in "real life", without the padding). Trouble is, Sherman/Buddy may be more slender, but the serum somehow boosts his testosterone levels alarmingly so that the handsome stud also becomes insufferable, loud, and embarrassing. These qualities simultaneously attract and repel Carla and the audience. Buddy's abrasive manner isn't the only problem. It seems that the serum has only a temporary effect and tends to wear off at inopportune moments, such as when Buddy's transformation back to portly Sherman interrupts his date with Carla and eventually gets him wedged inside a Viper sports car. And so it progresses. With each Sherman/Buddy change and reversion, the audience slowly learns that, counter to what Sherman initially believes, fewer and fewer people prefer Buddy. In fact, the subconscious impermanence of the serum indicates, to me anyway, that Sherman really, and correctly, prefers himself to Buddy. However, alter ego Buddy soon shows his selfish monstrousness. With his devious talk, his promiscuity, and his plotting, Buddy causes Sherman to lose just about everything good in his life - job, home, a social life. Worst of all, Sherman will lose his very identity if Buddy manages to take two timed gulps of his formula to remain Buddy forever. Like Jekyll fighting Hyde, Sherman literally has to get his life back. At an ornate gala where a pharmaceutical manufacturer Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is expected to fund Sherman's college research, the fight does occur. After a titanic struggle, Sherman reclaims his body. Again, in a dignified heartfelt speech Sherman apologizes for the calamities, hurt, and chaos he has caused as Buddy and finally learns that you have to love and be comfortable with yourself. This candor impresses Harlan enough to make the grant, and charms Carla enough to accept a dance with Sherman. Funny thing about the fat jokes, comments, and slapstick throughout the movie - we laugh at them, but not at the person who endures them. Whether getting stuck in a chair or car, or erasing a blackboard with his belly, or getting chewed out by a venal, insulting, weaselly dean (Larry Miller) or struggling to walk up stairs or exercise, Sherman preserves his dignity and likability. We even wince a little, because such a nice, accomplished person should not have to put up with such misadventures. Through the laughter, we urge Sherman to find the courage, self-assertion, and self-love to get the happiness he deserves. Even his seemingly uncouth and raunchy family (most members played by the versatile Murphy himself) point him in that direction; they may be fat and flatulent and undisciplined, but they also love and accept themselves exactly as they are. In a distorted way, even Sherman's alter ego Buddy tries to urge Sherman forward. "No matter what, you got to strut!" And so Sherman ultimately does, because at heart, he was always a scholar and a gentleman.

    You know many films that come out today don't have a good moral to the story. Many of today's films lack a good message and are more about style then substance. You know those films with nothing but sex and violence; nothing good but the special effects that are really not so special anymore. This film however was made soon before the film industry went on it's downward spiral. Poor Sherman Klump. He works as a professor at a local college and he is looking for a way to lose weight. He comes up with a solution. A liquid that will progressively bring his weight down slowly. One day he meets a woman named Carla and he falls hard for her. He decides to take her out for a date. They end up at a Comedy Club called The Scream. While there they enjoy an evening of music. At some point however a heckler named Reggie who takes people from the audience and makes fun of their looks. Unfortunately Sherman knows whats going on and decides to get up and leave however the spotlight finds his butt and Reggie goes all out with his fat jokes. Sherman is saddened and goes home upset. He has a dream where he becomes really fat. Sherman wakes up frightened and decides that he is going to become thin once and for all. He goes to his lab and takes some of the solution. He ends up passing out and in the morning he wakes up super thin. This is where his life will take a serious turn for the worse. He decides that he is going to take the solution to take out Carla and try to impress her as an alias under Buddy Love. Carla likes him at first but one problem Sherman has is that the solution wears off after awhile and he has to take more to stay in his thin Buddy form. Another drawback of the solution is that his testosterone levels go through the roof when he takes it. Sherman is being overcome by his new counterpart Buddy and Buddy wants to take all the credit for the professors solution. Professor Klump is able to beat Buddy and admits to everyone that he was so obsessed with losing weight and fitting in that he lost track of what he really wanted to do which was to help people. Carla had no problem with Sherman even while he was fat and she really liked him for who he was. The Nutty Professor has some potty humor in it but it still has a great message. Be happy with who you are. Don't let the jerks get you down. I have to agree that fat people are one of the most made fun of today along with people gays. When will people start to become more caring about people's real beauty and stop worrying about self image? We need more movies like this today. Our society is becoming more concerned with looks more and more everyday. Even young girls are being targeted. This is a movie that shows where the real beauty is; inside and not out.

    Eddie Murphy's THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996) is one of the mainstream classics of the 1990s. It's a great comedy with an emotional center, focusing on a lonely, overweight college professor who falls in love with a beautiful grad student and takes an experimental formula to lose weight and become the kind of man the young lady would want. It's a twist on the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde story, with the formula bringing out a new personality in the scientist. Not that many viewers will care, but this update is a pretty faithful adaptation of Jerry Lewis's original 1963 film of the same name, in spirit at least. I've seen Lewis's film only once, but enjoyed it very much. In Lewis's version, the professor is almost grotesquely awkward and nerdy before being transformed into the suave hipster Buddy Love. This remake adds the weight loss angle, although the formula still makes Buddy Love a confident, smooth-talking ladies' man. The coolest guy in the room. Everyone knows that Eddie Murphy is inside the Sherman Klump fatsuit, although the makeup and Murphy's Sherman persona are very effective. Most people also know that Murphy plays the other members of the overweight Klump family as well, Sherman's mother, father, grandmother, and brother. Again the makeup jobs are great and Murphy brings each character to life. The famous dinner table scenes are comedic tours de force. What many people may not know is that Eddie Murphy also plays the white Richard Simmons-like fitness guru Lance Perkins. I know some people assumed it really was Richard Simmons, but it's Eddie Murphy again in heavy makeup. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR showcases Murphy's great talent for playing different characters. Jada Pinkett, best known today as the wife/mother in the Will Smith entertainment clan, plays the fetching young colleague who admires Professor Klump's work and steals his heart. Klump sets her up with his slimmed-down alter ego Buddy Love, though it becomes clear that Buddy is a self-centered monster who lacks the sensitivity and kindness that the girl admires in the professor. Meanwhile Buddy plots to destroy Sherman once and for all and take over his body on a more permanent basis. Larry Miller plays the villainous college dean, James Coburn plays a millionaire interested in contributing to the school, and a young Dave Chappelle plays an obnoxious stand-up comic. The movie has a mainstream comedy feel, with some hammy performances and a rather low-brow sense of humor. (The Klump family relies rather heavily on fart jokes.) The film is dated by its mid-'90s fashions and music scene and the digital visual effects are noticeably phony (though still effective). But the 1960s version is hopelessly dated as a product of another era, too. Movies can't help it sometimes. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR is a top of the line comedy with some great work by the chameleonic Eddie Murphy. The movie succeeds because it's a comedy with a heart. We sympathize with Sherman Klump. He's shy, self-conscious about his appearance, embarrassed by his outspoken family. The film has a "be yourself" message. This Jekyll & Hyde fable is a great concept, first realized by comedy legend Jerry Lewis and later updated for a whole new audience. I'm surprised other IMDb users have been so harsh with their ratings of this film.

    Well, while it doesn't deny the necessity of self-improvement, it has the merit to assess the awareness of our specificity, our difference. And being aware of what we are stimulates the idea of our self-improvement as long as we keep aware of what we are not, and maybe the most important, what we can't and will never be. And the line between the incapability of this admittance and a low self-esteem is unfortunately, extremely thin. And "The Nutty Professor" is a wonderful comedy for its positive and insightful message about self-acceptance through a very sympathetic protagonist, Eddie Murphy as Professor Sherman Klump. Murphy perfectly diluted all his flamboyance and sometimes obnoxious flashiness in a sweet, gentle and likable character whose occupation besides teaching in college is to make DNA experiences on hamsters in order to find some medical solutions against obesity. Yet obesity doesn't seem to be an issue in his own life, not until he meets Carla Purty, his new colleague, played by the eye-pleasing Jada Pinckett Smith. Naturally, he falls in love, and we realize that we just meet Klump at a pivotal moment of his life, obesity became an issue. Tone-wise, Tom Shaydac's film finds the right balance between humor and sweetness. In one of the most hilarious cinematic family dinners, we meet the Klumps, a sight that works as a genetic alibi for Sherman's appearance. Eddie Murphy, who proved his chameleonic talent in such films as "Coming to America" is at the top of his game in "The Nutty Professor" where he's both a sweet and caring mother, a naughty Black mama, a mean-spirited blue-collar father, a superficial brother and Sherman Klump (the other character played by Murphy isn't featured in the scene, but you'd hardly recognize him as an Aerobic coach). The film, that won the Oscar for Best Make-Up, is the greatest credit to Murphy's talent when it comes to portray various characters. But there's more than discussions about weight and some farting contest in that dinner (always hilarious and never vulgar), the scene concludes with a beautiful exchange between Sherman and his mother. She loves him like any other mother, she sees both an inner and a physical beauty and we don't laugh at that. Whether he believed her or not is not the point, we can only sympathize with this good man, who wants this inner beauty to express itself. And when in the next scene, he asks Carla for a date, we understand Mama Klump found the right words to encourage her son to overcome his shyness. Carla is not indifferent to Sherman and accepts the date unaware that it would lead to a disaster because the restaurant stars a stand-up comedian who roasts people in the audience. Maybe I should have mentioned that the film is the remake of a Jerry Lewis' classic, but I don't think it's necessary since I know both stories are different. And I don't even think, the original is better just because it's the first one. All I know is I can more relate to a nerdy scientist who wants to be accepted by society than one who just wants to be a womanizer. Like so many great comedies like "Groundhog Day" or "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", there is a heart in "The Nutty Professor" and Eddie Murphy's so powerful that I could feel the way he felt. When everybody was getting their share of mocking jokes, he knew his turn was coming, and he would have it pretty bad (Dave Chappelle did a great job as the mean-spirited Reggie by the way), so when he tries to go to the toilet but unfortunately finds himself in the spotlight, we know the worst is to come. Murphy is so good in that role that it was impossible for me to laugh at Reggie's jokes; I could feel Sherman's broken heart, the devastation not just from the jokes, but from the people's reactions. The following scene is almost a tear-jerker when Carla tries to console him, he hardly speaks, the man was victim of a bullying that was the culmination of all the violence he tacitly endured. This is the pivotal moment where he decides to test his own researches on himself and become Buddy Love, a sort of Alpha Male who's got every thing a man can wish. Basically, Buddy Love is Eddie Murphy playing Eddie Murphy in the most irritating way, I missed Sherman Klump as soon as he disappeared but I forgive Buddy Love, if only for the magnificent revenge against Reggie, where the sprinkler became the sprinkled. Now, is the personality of Buddy Love irritating? I think it's the perfect representation of the way we indirectly perceive ourselves, since Sherman has low self-esteem, Buddy has exceedingly high self-esteem, it's his strength, his attitude almost embodies the whole 'Macho Man' theme song. Eddie Murphy mocks his own character as if he was aware that sometimes, being over confident can flirt with mean spiritedness, and he's so 'himself' that he manages to make us appreciate Sherman even more and this is the film's greatest message. I myself- had some issues with my appearance, and used to tell myself that I would be the most confident guy in the world if I had glasses, or if I were a few inches taller, but the meaning of our lives is not to wait for physical criteria to be confident and certainly not to compare ourselves to others, because that's the negation of our own specificity, and our capacity to contribute to the world on our own. The climactic speech is something I could respond to, it's the beautiful coming to realization of a man who didn't value himself enough while he had all the reasons to. It's like Eddie Murphy acknowledging that there is this soft spot he too often hided, because everybody expected him to be the smart-ass streetwise guy.

    Along with 'Beverly Hills Cop', it was the 'Nutty Professor' that cemented that signature Eddie Murphy smile as iconic. It's infectious and more often than not, serves to draw you more towards his characters. Although the protagonist is the sweet and unassuming Professor Klump, good old Eddie Murphy truly struts his stuff with the cocky, hyperactive alter ego, Buddy Love, the self proclaimed star of the show. The humour did, at times, descend to a very kiddish level with a comically obese man falling over and pushing things over, but the more mature hilarity really ensues with the 'embarassing family scenes', all the members of whom are portrayed by Murphy, underlining his prowess as a terrific multi character comedian regardless of age, gender or size. The chemistry between Murphy and Jada Pinkett was far from sizzling but Pinkett fulfilled the basic criteria of the love interest which allowed more attention to be shifted towards Murphy's two personas. A nice story which won't leave you in bouts of laughter upon finishing, but will bring more than a few throughout as you enjoy Eddie Murphy in his prime.

    Eddie Murphy has a reputation in Hollywood of being hard to work with and his track record since the late 90's hasn't been a good one. It makes it hard to remember just what a comedy genius this guy used to be, and The Nutty Professor is a prime example of that. Nobody else could have pulled off this role and made this film as good as it was. It's always been kind of a stupid story, but Murphy played into that and turned it into something that both kids and adults would find funny. No matter what you think of Eddie Murphy, it is impossible not to laugh during this movie. The Nutty Professor is two hours of fun, and on top of that, it's a refershing kind of comedy that we don't really see much of anymore.

    No (Fat) Joke, Sherman Klump is a Scholar and a Gentleman

    Even though a vast majority of the human population (present company included) does not possess, shall we say, a Greco-Roman physique, we nevertheless often belittle and disregard the overweight as somehow inferior. In the movies, this hypocritical bias is even more extreme. If an overweight person is (seldom) portrayed in a movie (whether as a star or in a supporting role), he/she will be either slow-witted, ill-tempered, clumsy, lazy, or some combination of all four. Most often, the overweight person will be there for one-dimensional comic relief. Eddie Murphy's character Sherman Klump in "The Nutty Professor" (hereafter "Nutty") goes a long way to correct most, if not all, of the overweight movie stereotypes, and against those hostile odds present an admirable human being indeed. Actually, Sherman in "Nutty" is mainly an inimitable character with many positive qualities. He is a brilliant, mostly well-respected biologist capable of revolutionary discoveries. Sherman is cultured, polite, dignified, charismatic and gracious, even under the most trying circumstances. He lives in a respectable apartment. He has a loving, if outspoken, family. Actually, apart from his obesity (and the inevitable maladroitness that comes with it), Sherman's only real shortcoming is his shyness and lack of self-assertion, especially around women. Even so, when Sherman meets beautiful but demure Wellman College colleague Carla Purdy (Jada Pinkett-Smith), her demure demeanor somehow gives him the courage to ask her out on a date. Sherman's life seems complete. However, when Sherman and Carla attend a comedy show, and Sherman endures a withering (but funny) barrage of fat jokes by kamikaze comedian Reggie (Dave Chappelle), the hurt and humiliation compel Sherman into a fateful decision. Never one to whine about his lot, Sherman determinedly (and hilariously) has tried every conceivable regimen (diet, exercise, acupuncture) to lose the pounds. Eventually, he begins to make progress, but not quickly enough. However, the weight-reduction serum Sherman has been distilling and testing on hamsters will accelerate the process. So after the comedy club debacle, Sherman impulsively swigs some of the serum, which astoundingly transforms him into the svelte, dynamic Buddy Love (Eddie in "real life", without the padding). Trouble is, Sherman/Buddy may be more slender, but the serum somehow boosts his testosterone levels alarmingly so that the handsome stud also becomes insufferable, loud, and embarrassing. These qualities simultaneously attract and repel Carla and the audience. Buddy's abrasive manner isn't the only problem. It seems that the serum has only a temporary effect and tends to wear off at inopportune moments, such as when Buddy's transformation back to portly Sherman interrupts his date with Carla and eventually gets him wedged inside a Viper sports car. And so it progresses. With each Sherman/Buddy change and reversion, the audience slowly learns that, counter to what Sherman initially believes, fewer and fewer people prefer Buddy. In fact, the subconscious impermanence of the serum indicates, to me anyway, that Sherman really, and correctly, prefers himself to Buddy. However, alter ego Buddy soon shows his selfish monstrousness. With his devious talk, his promiscuity, and his plotting, Buddy causes Sherman to lose just about everything good in his life - job, home, a social life. Worst of all, Sherman will lose his very identity if Buddy manages to take two timed gulps of his formula to remain Buddy forever. Like Jekyll fighting Hyde, Sherman literally has to get his life back. At an ornate gala where a pharmaceutical manufacturer Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is expected to fund Sherman's college research, the fight does occur. After a titanic struggle, Sherman reclaims his body. Again, in a dignified heartfelt speech Sherman apologizes for the calamities, hurt, and chaos he has caused as Buddy and finally learns that you have to love and be comfortable with yourself. This candor impresses Harlan enough to make the grant, and charms Carla enough to accept a dance with Sherman. Funny thing about the fat jokes, comments, and slapstick throughout the movie - we laugh at them, but not at the person who endures them. Whether getting stuck in a chair or car, or erasing a blackboard with his belly, or getting chewed out by a venal, insulting, weaselly dean (Larry Miller) or struggling to walk up stairs or exercise, Sherman preserves his dignity and likability. We even wince a little, because such a nice, accomplished person should not have to put up with such misadventures. Through the laughter, we urge Sherman to find the courage, self-assertion, and self-love to get the happiness he deserves. Even his seemingly uncouth and raunchy family (most members played by the versatile Murphy himself) point him in that direction; they may be fat and flatulent and undisciplined, but they also love and accept themselves exactly as they are. In a distorted way, even Sherman's alter ego Buddy tries to urge Sherman forward. "No matter what, you got to strut!" And so Sherman ultimately does, because at heart, he was always a scholar and a gentleman.

    You know many films that come out today don't have a good moral to the story. Many of today's films lack a good message and are more about style then substance. You know those films with nothing but sex and violence; nothing good but the special effects that are really not so special anymore. This film however was made soon before the film industry went on it's downward spiral. Poor Sherman Klump. He works as a professor at a local college and he is looking for a way to lose weight. He comes up with a solution. A liquid that will progressively bring his weight down slowly. One day he meets a woman named Carla and he falls hard for her. He decides to take her out for a date. They end up at a Comedy Club called The Scream. While there they enjoy an evening of music. At some point however a heckler named Reggie who takes people from the audience and makes fun of their looks. Unfortunately Sherman knows whats going on and decides to get up and leave however the spotlight finds his butt and Reggie goes all out with his fat jokes. Sherman is saddened and goes home upset. He has a dream where he becomes really fat. Sherman wakes up frightened and decides that he is going to become thin once and for all. He goes to his lab and takes some of the solution. He ends up passing out and in the morning he wakes up super thin. This is where his life will take a serious turn for the worse. He decides that he is going to take the solution to take out Carla and try to impress her as an alias under Buddy Love. Carla likes him at first but one problem Sherman has is that the solution wears off after awhile and he has to take more to stay in his thin Buddy form. Another drawback of the solution is that his testosterone levels go through the roof when he takes it. Sherman is being overcome by his new counterpart Buddy and Buddy wants to take all the credit for the professors solution. Professor Klump is able to beat Buddy and admits to everyone that he was so obsessed with losing weight and fitting in that he lost track of what he really wanted to do which was to help people. Carla had no problem with Sherman even while he was fat and she really liked him for who he was. The Nutty Professor has some potty humor in it but it still has a great message. Be happy with who you are. Don't let the jerks get you down. I have to agree that fat people are one of the most made fun of today along with people gays. When will people start to become more caring about people's real beauty and stop worrying about self image? We need more movies like this today. Our society is becoming more concerned with looks more and more everyday. Even young girls are being targeted. This is a movie that shows where the real beauty is; inside and not out.

    Eddie Murphy's THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996) is one of the mainstream classics of the 1990s. It's a great comedy with an emotional center, focusing on a lonely, overweight college professor who falls in love with a beautiful grad student and takes an experimental formula to lose weight and become the kind of man the young lady would want. It's a twist on the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde story, with the formula bringing out a new personality in the scientist. Not that many viewers will care, but this update is a pretty faithful adaptation of Jerry Lewis's original 1963 film of the same name, in spirit at least. I've seen Lewis's film only once, but enjoyed it very much. In Lewis's version, the professor is almost grotesquely awkward and nerdy before being transformed into the suave hipster Buddy Love. This remake adds the weight loss angle, although the formula still makes Buddy Love a confident, smooth-talking ladies' man. The coolest guy in the room. Everyone knows that Eddie Murphy is inside the Sherman Klump fatsuit, although the makeup and Murphy's Sherman persona are very effective. Most people also know that Murphy plays the other members of the overweight Klump family as well, Sherman's mother, father, grandmother, and brother. Again the makeup jobs are great and Murphy brings each character to life. The famous dinner table scenes are comedic tours de force. What many people may not know is that Eddie Murphy also plays the white Richard Simmons-like fitness guru Lance Perkins. I know some people assumed it really was Richard Simmons, but it's Eddie Murphy again in heavy makeup. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR showcases Murphy's great talent for playing different characters. Jada Pinkett, best known today as the wife/mother in the Will Smith entertainment clan, plays the fetching young colleague who admires Professor Klump's work and steals his heart. Klump sets her up with his slimmed-down alter ego Buddy Love, though it becomes clear that Buddy is a self-centered monster who lacks the sensitivity and kindness that the girl admires in the professor. Meanwhile Buddy plots to destroy Sherman once and for all and take over his body on a more permanent basis. Larry Miller plays the villainous college dean, James Coburn plays a millionaire interested in contributing to the school, and a young Dave Chappelle plays an obnoxious stand-up comic. The movie has a mainstream comedy feel, with some hammy performances and a rather low-brow sense of humor. (The Klump family relies rather heavily on fart jokes.) The film is dated by its mid-'90s fashions and music scene and the digital visual effects are noticeably phony (though still effective). But the 1960s version is hopelessly dated as a product of another era, too. Movies can't help it sometimes. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR is a top of the line comedy with some great work by the chameleonic Eddie Murphy. The movie succeeds because it's a comedy with a heart. We sympathize with Sherman Klump. He's shy, self-conscious about his appearance, embarrassed by his outspoken family. The film has a "be yourself" message. This Jekyll & Hyde fable is a great concept, first realized by comedy legend Jerry Lewis and later updated for a whole new audience. I'm surprised other IMDb users have been so harsh with their ratings of this film.

    Like seriously this movie was so ******* hilarious I laughed at the fart jokes,and Eddie Murphy playing 7 CHARACTERS(he was the granny,the fitness instructor,the professor,Buddy Love,his mother,his father,and his brother,thanks to some special make up effects by Rick Baker who also did Susan Sarandon's transformation for Enchanted). The story is about a shy modest professor named Sherman Klumps,a man who is so shy to ask a girl on a date just because he is rather obese and his family are rather obese too. So since his a professor and all,he works on a formula that can turn obese people or obese animals into slim form. But when he tries it on himself he becomes the incredibly loud- mouthed,charming,womanizer,douch-bag Buddy Love. But when the girl that he fancy's(played by Will Smith's wife Jada Pinkett),he realizes that you have to accept who you are as a person no matter if your big or small. I know this film may offend people who are obese but for people who want a good laugh I recommend this film as I am a HUGE FAN of Eddie Murphy. Overall im giving it a 7/10

    Sherman Klump, is a brilliant and a very fat man. One day he meets a beautiful and charming woman named Carla Purty, and he falls in love with her. He is aware to the fact, though, that he is a clumsy fat guy, while she is a young gorgeous lady. This makes him feel depressed, but he finds the solution for his problem. He decides to drink a potion which he invented himself in his lab. The potion makes him everything he wanted to be. The new him, Buddy Love, is the perfect solution for Klump, in his opinion. But is that what Carla really wants........ Yes the film has plenty of fart jokes, and has been lambasted by. Any for being to in the toilets regarding the humour, but look deeper, and you have one of the most heartwarming comedies of the nineties, and a hilarious movie to boot. The scene in the club where Chapelle is heckling Klump, is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the movie, or really any comedy come to think of it, and this is down to the talent that Murphy has, yes he has made a few bombs the last few years, but this really shows his comic genius and great acting skills. The family scenes are brilliant and so funny, you really believe that all those characters are sitting round that table and interacting. Buddy Love surprisingly lets the film down. He starts off okay, but by the end he's just a pantomime villain who really really overacts. So all in all, it was a great return to form for Murphy, and like I've already said, proves that he is a really talented actor and comedian.

    I'll be very honest, i've only seen a few parts of this movie, but that was just enough, and I have 0 desire to watch the rest. This "Comedy" is just so unfunny and insulting to the intelligence! it consists of fart humour, and other unfunny garbage that people seem to find funny nowadays, which is just sad because there are many other comedy movies that are far funnier and superior but they seem to get overlooked nowadays. even sex lives of the potato men was more watchable compared to this. eddy murphy's career has already been ruined because he keeps starring in awful movies like this. overall, if you haven't seen this movie, avoid it, and pretend it doesn't exist, unless you're really that much of a masochist, or an idiot who laughs at unfunny fart humour.

    The Nutty Professor (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Hilarious remake of the Jerry Lewis film about the overweight Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) who comes up with a chemical that will turn anyone skinny overnight. Klump rushes the experiment on himself after an embarrassing night out and becomes the skinny but annoying Buddy Love (Murphy). At first Buddy thinks this is what he wants but the side effects quickly follow. I don't care what anyone says but Eddie Murphy should have won the Oscar for this film and yes I've seen all the nominations from that year. It's rather amazing to see what Murphy was able to do here, playing at least seven characters and making of them one of the most memorable you're ever going to see. I don't care who you are but when you see Sherman Klump you can't help but fall in love with the character and the way Murphy plays him is just something amazing to watch. Even the Buddy Love character is quite memorable and this doesn't even cover the Klump family that Murphy perfectly handles. Rick Baker also deserves a lot of credit for the special effects and these here have to be considered some of the greatest of his career. The film really does walk the line between hilarious comedy and some rather sad and dramatic moments. There's no question that the film really packs a punch no matter what it's trying to do. The story itself certainly comes with a message that's not preachy and I think Murphy really delivers it in a touching way. The one flaw with the film is that it breaks out of a realistic nature at times and especially with way too many fart jokes. Still, there's no question that this here is Murphy at his greatest and the Sherman character is just so great that you can't help but be won over by the film.

    Well, while it doesn't deny the necessity of self-improvement, it has the merit to assess the awareness of our specificity, our difference. And being aware of what we are stimulates the idea of our self-improvement as long as we keep aware of what we are not, and maybe the most important, what we can't and will never be. And the line between the incapability of this admittance and a low self-esteem is unfortunately, extremely thin. And "The Nutty Professor" is a wonderful comedy for its positive and insightful message about self-acceptance through a very sympathetic protagonist, Eddie Murphy as Professor Sherman Klump. Murphy perfectly diluted all his flamboyance and sometimes obnoxious flashiness in a sweet, gentle and likable character whose occupation besides teaching in college is to make DNA experiences on hamsters in order to find some medical solutions against obesity. Yet obesity doesn't seem to be an issue in his own life, not until he meets Carla Purty, his new colleague, played by the eye-pleasing Jada Pinckett Smith. Naturally, he falls in love, and we realize that we just meet Klump at a pivotal moment of his life, obesity became an issue. Tone-wise, Tom Shaydac's film finds the right balance between humor and sweetness. In one of the most hilarious cinematic family dinners, we meet the Klumps, a sight that works as a genetic alibi for Sherman's appearance. Eddie Murphy, who proved his chameleonic talent in such films as "Coming to America" is at the top of his game in "The Nutty Professor" where he's both a sweet and caring mother, a naughty Black mama, a mean-spirited blue-collar father, a superficial brother and Sherman Klump (the other character played by Murphy isn't featured in the scene, but you'd hardly recognize him as an Aerobic coach).

Whether he believed her or not is not the point, we can only sympathize with this good man, who wants this inner beauty to express itself.

Carla is not indifferent to Sherman and accepts the date unaware that it would lead to a disaster because the restaurant stars a stand-up comedian who roasts people in the audience. Maybe I should have mentioned that the film is the remake of a Jerry Lewis' classic, but I don't think it's necessary since I know both stories are different.

Like so many great comedies like "Groundhog Day" or "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", there is a heart in "The Nutty Professor" and Eddie Murphy's so powerful that I could feel the way he felt. When everybody was getting their share of mocking jokes, he knew his turn was coming, and he would have it pretty bad (Dave Chappelle did a great job as the mean-spirited Reggie by the way), so when he tries to go to the toilet but unfortunately finds himself in the spotlight, we know the worst is to come. Murphy is so good in that role that it was impossible for me to laugh at Reggie's jokes; I could feel Sherman's broken heart, the devastation not just from the jokes, but from the people's reactions. The following scene is almost a tear-jerker when Carla tries to console him, he hardly speaks, the man was victim of a bullying that was the culmination of all the violence he tacitly endured.

Now, is the personality of Buddy Love irritating? I think it's the perfect representation of the way we indirectly perceive ourselves, since Sherman has low self-esteem, Buddy has exceedingly high self-esteem, it's his strength, his attitude almost embodies the whole 'Macho Man' theme song. Eddie Murphy mocks his own character as if he was aware that sometimes, being over confident can flirt with mean spiritedness, and he's so 'himself' that he manages to make us appreciate Sherman even more and this is the film's greatest message. I myself- had some issues with my appearance, and used to tell myself that I would be the most confident guy in the world if I had glasses, or if I were a few inches taller, but the meaning of our lives is not to wait for physical criteria to be confident and certainly not to compare ourselves to others, because that's the negation of our own specificity, and our capacity to contribute to the world on our own. The climactic speech is something I could respond to, it's the beautiful coming to realization of a man who didn't value himself enough while he had all the reasons to. It's like Eddie Murphy acknowledging that there is this soft spot he too often hided, because everybody expected him to be the smart-ass streetwise guy.

    Eddie Murphy has a reputation in Hollywood of being hard to work with and his track record since the late 90's hasn't been a good one. It makes it hard to remember just what a comedy genius this guy used to be, and The Nutty Professor is a prime example of that. Nobody else could have pulled off this role and made this film as good as it was. It's always been kind of a stupid story, but Murphy played into that and turned it into something that both kids and adults would find funny. No matter what you think of Eddie Murphy, it is impossible not to laugh during this movie. The Nutty Professor is two hours of fun, and on top of that, it's a refershing kind of comedy that we don't really see much of anymore.

    Even though a vast majority of the human population (present company included) does not possess, shall we say, a Greco-Roman physique, we nevertheless often belittle and disregard the overweight as somehow inferior. In the movies, this hypocritical bias is even more extreme. If an overweight person is (seldom) portrayed in a movie (whether as a star or in a supporting role), he/she will be either slow-witted, ill-tempered, clumsy, lazy, or some combination of all four. Most often, the overweight person will be there for one-dimensional comic relief. Eddie Murphy's character Sherman Klump in "The Nutty Professor" (hereafter "Nutty") goes a long way to correct most, if not all, of the overweight movie stereotypes, and against those hostile odds present an admirable human being indeed. Actually, Sherman in "Nutty" is mainly an inimitable character with many positive qualities. He is a brilliant, mostly well-respected biologist capable of revolutionary discoveries. Sherman is cultured, polite, dignified, charismatic and gracious, even under the most trying circumstances. He lives in a respectable apartment. He has a loving, if outspoken, family. Actually, apart from his obesity (and the inevitable maladroitness that comes with it), Sherman's only real shortcoming is his shyness and lack of self-assertion, especially around women. Even so, when Sherman meets beautiful but demure Wellman College colleague Carla Purdy (Jada Pinkett-Smith), her demure demeanor somehow gives him the courage to ask her out on a date. Sherman's life seems complete. However, when Sherman and Carla attend a comedy show, and Sherman endures a withering (but funny) barrage of fat jokes by kamikaze comedian Reggie (Dave Chappelle), the hurt and humiliation compel Sherman into a fateful decision. Never one to whine about his lot, Sherman determinedly (and hilariously) has tried every conceivable regimen (diet, exercise, acupuncture) to lose the pounds. Eventually, he begins to make progress, but not quickly enough. However, the weight-reduction serum Sherman has been distilling and testing on hamsters will accelerate the process. So after the comedy club debacle, Sherman impulsively swigs some of the serum, which astoundingly transforms him into the svelte, dynamic Buddy Love (Eddie in "real life", without the padding). Trouble is, Sherman/Buddy may be more slender, but the serum somehow boosts his testosterone levels alarmingly so that the handsome stud also becomes insufferable, loud, and embarrassing. These qualities simultaneously attract and repel Carla and the audience. Buddy's abrasive manner isn't the only problem. It seems that the serum has only a temporary effect and tends to wear off at inopportune moments, such as when Buddy's transformation back to portly Sherman interrupts his date with Carla and eventually gets him wedged inside a Viper sports car. And so it progresses. With each Sherman/Buddy change and reversion, the audience slowly learns that, counter to what Sherman initially believes, fewer and fewer people prefer Buddy. In fact, the subconscious impermanence of the serum indicates, to me anyway, that Sherman really, and correctly, prefers himself to Buddy. However, alter ego Buddy soon shows his selfish monstrousness. With his devious talk, his promiscuity, and his plotting, Buddy causes Sherman to lose just about everything good in his life - job, home, a social life. Worst of all, Sherman will lose his very identity if Buddy manages to take two timed gulps of his formula to remain Buddy forever. Like Jekyll fighting Hyde, Sherman literally has to get his life back. At an ornate gala where a pharmaceutical manufacturer Harlan Hartley (James Coburn) is expected to fund Sherman's college research, the fight does occur. After a titanic struggle, Sherman reclaims his body. Again, in a dignified heartfelt speech Sherman apologizes for the calamities, hurt, and chaos he has caused as Buddy and finally learns that you have to love and be comfortable with yourself. This candor impresses Harlan enough to make the grant, and charms Carla enough to accept a dance with Sherman. Funny thing about the fat jokes, comments, and slapstick throughout the movie - we laugh at them, but not at the person who endures them. Whether getting stuck in a chair or car, or erasing a blackboard with his belly, or getting chewed out by a venal, insulting, weaselly dean (Larry Miller) or struggling to walk up stairs or exercise, Sherman preserves his dignity and likability. We even wince a little, because such a nice, accomplished person should not have to put up with such misadventures. Through the laughter, we urge Sherman to find the courage, self-assertion, and self-love to get the happiness he deserves. Even his seemingly uncouth and raunchy family (most members played by the versatile Murphy himself) point him in that direction; they may be fat and flatulent and undisciplined, but they also love and accept themselves exactly as they are. In a distorted way, even Sherman's alter ego Buddy tries to urge Sherman forward. "No matter what, you got to strut!" And so Sherman ultimately does, because at heart, he was always a scholar and a gentleman.

    You know many films that come out today don't have a good moral to the story. Many of today's films lack a good message and are more about style then substance. You know those films with nothing but sex and violence; nothing good but the special effects that are really not so special anymore. This film however was made soon before the film industry went on it's downward spiral. Poor Sherman Klump. He works as a professor at a local college and he is looking for a way to lose weight. He comes up with a solution. A liquid that will progressively bring his weight down slowly. One day he meets a woman named Carla and he falls hard for her. He decides to take her out for a date. They end up at a Comedy Club called The Scream. While there they enjoy an evening of music. At some point however a heckler named Reggie who takes people from the audience and makes fun of their looks. Unfortunately Sherman knows whats going on and decides to get up and leave however the spotlight finds his butt and Reggie goes all out with his fat jokes. Sherman is saddened and goes home upset. He has a dream where he becomes really fat. Sherman wakes up frightened and decides that he is going to become thin once and for all. He goes to his lab and takes some of the solution. He ends up passing out and in the morning he wakes up super thin. This is where his life will take a serious turn for the worse. He decides that he is going to take the solution to take out Carla and try to impress her as an alias under Buddy Love. Carla likes him at first but one problem Sherman has is that the solution wears off after awhile and he has to take more to stay in his thin Buddy form. Another drawback of the solution is that his testosterone levels go through the roof when he takes it. Sherman is being overcome by his new counterpart Buddy and Buddy wants to take all the credit for the professors solution. Professor Klump is able to beat Buddy and admits to everyone that he was so obsessed with losing weight and fitting in that he lost track of what he really wanted to do which was to help people. Carla had no problem with Sherman even while he was fat and she really liked him for who he was. The Nutty Professor has some potty humor in it but it still has a great message. Be happy with who you are. Don't let the jerks get you down. I have to agree that fat people are one of the most made fun of today along with people gays. When will people start to become more caring about people's real beauty and stop worrying about self image? We need more movies like this today. Our society is becoming more concerned with looks more and more everyday. Even young girls are being targeted. This is a movie that shows where the real beauty is; inside and not out.

    Eddie Murphy's THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996) is one of the mainstream classics of the 1990s. It's a great comedy with an emotional center, focusing on a lonely, overweight college professor who falls in love with a beautiful grad student and takes an experimental formula to lose weight and become the kind of man the young lady would want. It's a twist on the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde story, with the formula bringing out a new personality in the scientist. Not that many viewers will care, but this update is a pretty faithful adaptation of Jerry Lewis's original 1963 film of the same name, in spirit at least. I've seen Lewis's film only once, but enjoyed it very much. In Lewis's version, the professor is almost grotesquely awkward and nerdy before being transformed into the suave hipster Buddy Love. This remake adds the weight loss angle, although the formula still makes Buddy Love a confident, smooth-talking ladies' man. The coolest guy in the room. Everyone knows that Eddie Murphy is inside the Sherman Klump fatsuit, although the makeup and Murphy's Sherman persona are very effective. Most people also know that Murphy plays the other members of the overweight Klump family as well, Sherman's mother, father, grandmother, and brother. Again the makeup jobs are great and Murphy brings each character to life. The famous dinner table scenes are comedic tours de force. What many people may not know is that Eddie Murphy also plays the white Richard Simmons-like fitness guru Lance Perkins. I know some people assumed it really was Richard Simmons, but it's Eddie Murphy again in heavy makeup. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR showcases Murphy's great talent for playing different characters. Jada Pinkett, best known today as the wife/mother in the Will Smith entertainment clan, plays the fetching young colleague who admires Professor Klump's work and steals his heart. Klump sets her up with his slimmed-down alter ego Buddy Love, though it becomes clear that Buddy is a self-centered monster who lacks the sensitivity and kindness that the girl admires in the professor. Meanwhile Buddy plots to destroy Sherman once and for all and take over his body on a more permanent basis. Larry Miller plays the villainous college dean, James Coburn plays a millionaire interested in contributing to the school, and a young Dave Chappelle plays an obnoxious stand-up comic. The movie has a mainstream comedy feel, with some hammy performances and a rather low-brow sense of humor. (The Klump family relies rather heavily on fart jokes.) The film is dated by its mid-'90s fashions and music scene and the digital visual effects are noticeably phony (though still effective). But the 1960s version is hopelessly dated as a product of another era, too. Movies can't help it sometimes. THE NUTTY PROFESSOR is a top of the line comedy with some great work by the chameleonic Eddie Murphy. The movie succeeds because it's a comedy with a heart. We sympathize with Sherman Klump. He's shy, self-conscious about his appearance, embarrassed by his outspoken family. The film has a "be yourself" message. This Jekyll & Hyde fable is a great concept, first realized by comedy legend Jerry Lewis and later updated for a whole new audience. I'm surprised other IMDb users have been so harsh with their ratings of this film.

    Like seriously this movie was so ******* hilarious I laughed at the fart jokes,and Eddie Murphy playing 7 CHARACTERS(he was the granny,the fitness instructor,the professor,Buddy Love,his mother,his father,and his brother,thanks to some special make up effects by Rick Baker who also did Susan Sarandon's transformation for Enchanted). The story is about a shy modest professor named Sherman Klumps,a man who is so shy to ask a girl on a date just because he is rather obese and his family are rather obese too. So since his a professor and all,he works on a formula that can turn obese people or obese animals into slim form. But when he tries it on himself he becomes the incredibly loud- mouthed,charming,womanizer,douch-bag Buddy Love. But when the girl that he fancy's(played by Will Smith's wife Jada Pinkett),he realizes that you have to accept who you are as a person no matter if your big or small. I know this film may offend people who are obese but for people who want a good laugh I recommend this film as I am a HUGE FAN of Eddie Murphy. Overall im giving it a 7/10

    Sherman Klump, is a brilliant and a very fat man. One day he meets a beautiful and charming woman named Carla Purty, and he falls in love with her. He is aware to the fact, though, that he is a clumsy fat guy, while she is a young gorgeous lady. This makes him feel depressed, but he finds the solution for his problem. He decides to drink a potion which he invented himself in his lab. The potion makes him everything he wanted to be. The new him, Buddy Love, is the perfect solution for Klump, in his opinion. But is that what Carla really wants........ Yes the film has plenty of fart jokes, and has been lambasted by. Any for being to in the toilets regarding the humour, but look deeper, and you have one of the most heartwarming comedies of the nineties, and a hilarious movie to boot. The scene in the club where Chapelle is heckling Klump, is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the movie, or really any comedy come to think of it, and this is down to the talent that Murphy has, yes he has made a few bombs the last few years, but this really shows his comic genius and great acting skills. The family scenes are brilliant and so funny, you really believe that all those characters are sitting round that table and interacting. Buddy Love surprisingly lets the film down. He starts off okay, but by the end he's just a pantomime villain who really really overacts. So all in all, it was a great return to form for Murphy, and like I've already said, proves that he is a really talented actor and comedian.

    I'll be very honest, i've only seen a few parts of this movie, but that was just enough, and I have 0 desire to watch the rest. This "Comedy" is just so unfunny and insulting to the intelligence! it consists of fart humour, and other unfunny garbage that people seem to find funny nowadays, which is just sad because there are many other comedy movies that are far funnier and superior but they seem to get overlooked nowadays. even sex lives of the potato men was more watchable compared to this. eddy murphy's career has already been ruined because he keeps starring in awful movies like this. overall, if you haven't seen this movie, avoid it, and pretend it doesn't exist, unless you're really that much of a masochist, or an idiot who laughs at unfunny fart humour.

    The Nutty Professor (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Hilarious remake of the Jerry Lewis film about the overweight Sherman Klump (Eddie Murphy) who comes up with a chemical that will turn anyone skinny overnight. Klump rushes the experiment on himself after an embarrassing night out and becomes the skinny but annoying Buddy Love (Murphy). At first Buddy thinks this is what he wants but the side effects quickly follow. I don't care what anyone says but Eddie Murphy should have won the Oscar for this film and yes I've seen all the nominations from that year. It's rather amazing to see what Murphy was able to do here, playing at least seven characters and making of them one of the most memorable you're ever going to see. I don't care who you are but when you see Sherman Klump you can't help but fall in love with the character and the way Murphy plays him is just something amazing to watch. Even the Buddy Love character is quite memorable and this doesn't even cover the Klump family that Murphy perfectly handles. Rick Baker also deserves a lot of credit for the special effects and these here have to be considered some of the greatest of his career. The film really does walk the line between hilarious comedy and some rather sad and dramatic moments. There's no question that the film really packs a punch no matter what it's trying to do. The story itself certainly comes with a message that's not preachy and I think Murphy really delivers it in a touching way. The one flaw with the film is that it breaks out of a realistic nature at times and especially with way too many fart jokes. Still, there's no question that this here is Murphy at his greatest and the Sherman character is just so great that you can't help but be won over by the film.

    Well, while it doesn't deny the necessity of self-improvement, it has the merit to assess the awareness of our specificity, our difference. And being aware of what we are stimulates the idea of our self-improvement as long as we keep aware of what we are not, and maybe the most important, what we can't and will never be. And the line between the incapability of this admittance and a low self-esteem is unfortunately, extremely thin. And "The Nutty Professor" is a wonderful comedy for its positive and insightful message about self-acceptance through a very sympathetic protagonist, Eddie Murphy as Professor Sherman Klump. Murphy perfectly diluted all his flamboyance and sometimes obnoxious flashiness in a sweet, gentle and likable character whose occupation besides teaching in college is to make DNA experiences on hamsters in order to find some medical solutions against obesity. Yet obesity doesn't seem to be an issue in his own life, not until he meets Carla Purty, his new colleague, played by the eye-pleasing Jada Pinckett Smith. Naturally, he falls in love, and we realize that we just meet Klump at a pivotal moment of his life, obesity became an issue. Tone-wise, Tom Shaydac's film finds the right balance between humor and sweetness. In one of the most hilarious cinematic family dinners, we meet the Klumps, a sight that works as a genetic alibi for Sherman's appearance. Eddie Murphy, who proved his chameleonic talent in such films as "Coming to America" is at the top of his game in "The Nutty Professor" where he's both a sweet and caring mother, a naughty Black mama, a mean-spirited blue-collar father, a superficial brother and Sherman Klump (the other character played by Murphy isn't featured in the scene, but you'd hardly recognize him as an Aerobic coach). The film, that won the Oscar for Best Make-Up, is the greatest credit to Murphy's talent when it comes to portray various characters. But there's more than discussions about weight and some farting contest in that dinner (always hilarious and never vulgar), the scene concludes with a beautiful exchange between Sherman and his mother. She loves him like any other mother, she sees both an inner and a physical beauty and we don't laugh at that. Whether he believed her or not is not the point, we can only sympathize with this good man, who wants this inner beauty to express itself. And when in the next scene, he asks Carla for a date, we understand Mama Klump found the right words to encourage her son to overcome his shyness. Carla is not indifferent to Sherman and accepts the date unaware that it would lead to a disaster because the restaurant stars a stand-up comedian who roasts people in the audience. Maybe I should have mentioned that the film is the remake of a Jerry Lewis' classic, but I don't think it's necessary since I know both stories are different. And I don't even think, the original is better just because it's the first one. All I know is I can more relate to a nerdy scientist who wants to be accepted by society than one who just wants to be a womanizer. Like so many great comedies like "Groundhog Day" or "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", there is a heart in "The Nutty Professor" and Eddie Murphy's so powerful that I could feel the way he felt. When everybody was getting their share of mocking jokes, he knew his turn was coming, and he would have it pretty bad (Dave Chappelle did a great job as the mean-spirited Reggie by the way), so when he tries to go to the toilet but unfortunately finds himself in the spotlight, we know the worst is to come. Murphy is so good in that role that it was impossible for me to laugh at Reggie's jokes; I could feel Sherman's broken heart, the devastation not just from the jokes, but from the people's reactions. The following scene is almost a tear-jerker when Carla tries to console him, he hardly speaks, the man was victim of a bullying that was the culmination of all the violence he tacitly endured. This is the pivotal moment where he decides to test his own researches on himself and become Buddy Love, a sort of Alpha Male who's got every thing a man can wish. Basically, Buddy Love is Eddie Murphy playing Eddie Murphy in the most irritating way, I missed Sherman Klump as soon as he disappeared but I forgive Buddy Love, if only for the magnificent revenge against Reggie, where the sprinkler became the sprinkled. Now, is the personality of Buddy Love irritating? I think it's the perfect representation of the way we indirectly perceive ourselves, since Sherman has low self-esteem, Buddy has exceedingly high self-esteem, it's his strength, his attitude almost embodies the whole 'Macho Man' theme song. Eddie Murphy mocks his own character as if he was aware that sometimes, being over confident can flirt with mean spiritedness, and he's so 'himself' that he manages to make us appreciate Sherman even more and this is the film's greatest message. I myself- had some issues with my appearance, and used to tell myself that I would be the most confident guy in the world if I had glasses, or if I were a few inches taller, but the meaning of our lives is not to wait for physical criteria to be confident and certainly not to compare ourselves to others, because that's the negation of our own specificity, and our capacity to contribute to the world on our own. The climactic speech is something I could respond to, it's the beautiful coming to realization of a man who didn't value himself enough while he had all the reasons to. It's like Eddie Murphy acknowledging that there is this soft spot he too often hided, because everybody expected him to be the smart-ass streetwise guy.

    Along with 'Beverly Hills Cop', it was the 'Nutty Professor' that cemented that signature Eddie Murphy smile as iconic. It's infectious and more often than not, serves to draw you more towards his characters. Although the protagonist is the sweet and unassuming Professor Klump, good old Eddie Murphy truly struts his stuff with the cocky, hyperactive alter ego, Buddy Love, the self proclaimed star of the show. The humour did, at times, descend to a very kiddish level with a comically obese man falling over and pushing things over, but the more mature hilarity really ensues with the 'embarassing family scenes', all the members of whom are portrayed by Murphy, underlining his prowess as a terrific multi character comedian regardless of age, gender or size. The chemistry between Murphy and Jada Pinkett was far from sizzling but Pinkett fulfilled the basic criteria of the love interest which allowed more attention to be shifted towards Murphy's two personas. A nice story which won't leave you in bouts of laughter upon finishing, but will bring more than a few throughout as you enjoy Eddie Murphy in his prime.

It seems that the serum has only a temporary effect and tends to wear off at inopportune moments, such as when Buddy's transformation back to portly Sherman interrupts his date with Carla and eventually gets him wedged inside a Viper sports car. And so it progresses. With each Sherman/Buddy change and reversion, the audience slowly learns that, counter to what Sherman initially believes, fewer and fewer people prefer Buddy.

We even wince a little, because such a nice, accomplished person should not have to put up with such misadventures. Through the laughter, we urge Sherman to find the courage, self-assertion, and self-love to get the happiness he deserves. Even his seemingly uncouth and raunchy family (most members played by the versatile Murphy himself) point him in that direction; they may be fat and flatulent and undisciplined, but they also love and accept themselves exactly as they are. In a distorted way, even Sherman's alter ego Buddy tries to urge Sherman forward. "No matter what, you got to strut!" And so Sherman ultimately does, because at heart, he was always a scholar and a gentleman.

    You know many films that come out today don't have a good moral to the story. Many of today's films lack a good message and are more about style then substance. You know those films with nothing but sex and violence; nothing good but the special effects that are really not so special anymore. This film however was made soon before the film industry went on it's downward spiral. Poor Sherman Klump. He works as a professor at a local college and he is looking for a way to lose weight. He comes up with a solution. A liquid that will progressively bring his weight down slowly. One day he meets a woman named Carla and he falls hard for her. He decides to take her out for a date. They end up at a Comedy Club called The Scream. While there they enjoy an evening of music. At some point however a heckler named Reggie who takes people from the audience and makes fun of their looks. Unfortunately Sherman knows whats going on and decides to get up and leave however the spotlight finds his butt and Reggie goes all out with his fat jokes. Sherman is saddened and goes home upset. He has a dream where he becomes really fat. Sherman wakes up frightened and decides that he is going to become thin once and for all. He goes to his lab and takes some of the solution. He ends up passing out and in the morning he wakes up super thin. This is where his life will take a serious turn for the worse. He decides that he is going to take the solution to take out Carla and try to impress her as an alias under Buddy Love. Carla likes him at first but one problem Sherman has is that the solution wears off after awhile and he has to take more to stay in his thin Buddy form. Another drawback of the solution is that his testosterone levels go through the roof when he takes it. Sherman is being overcome by his new counterpart Buddy and Buddy wants to take all the credit for the professors solution. Professor Klump is able to beat Buddy and admits to everyone that he was so obsessed with losing weight and fitting in that he lost track of what he really wanted to do which was to help people. Carla had no problem with Sherman even while he was fat and she really liked him for who he was. The Nutty Professor has some potty humor in it but it still has a great message. Be happy with who you are. Don't let the jerks get you down. I have to agree that fat people are one of the most made fun of today along with people gays. When will people start to become more caring about people's real beauty and stop worrying about self image? We need more movies like this today. Our society is becoming more concerned with looks more and more everyday. Even young girls are being targeted. This is a movie that shows where the real beauty is; inside and not out.
