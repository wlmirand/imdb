    This flashback told tale is set up when British officer receives the titled earrings in the mail and lets loose with his story. It was World War II when Milland, on a secret mission in Germany, escaped from a prisoner of war camp and hooked up with lone gypsy Marlene Dietrich who helps him hide so he can complete a secret mission. Horny Dietrich latches on to him like tomato sauce onto spaghetti, pierces his ears and plants dark make-up upon him. Before you know it, Milland is telling Nazi soldiers their fortunes while realizing that finding Dietrich was the best thing that has yet happened to him. "His blood will turn to milk and his bones will crumble!" Dietrich tells Milland of a former lover who ran off on her. Yet, he sticks around, determined to complete his mission and helping the Allies beat the Nazis. "Today in Germany, everybody is watched. Even the watchers", the inventor of a gas that the Germans want for destructive purposes and the British want to (allegedly) only keep out of the German's hands. The aging Dietrich, overloaded in dark make-up, overly long eye lashes and an excess of veils, is pure camp as the extremely over affectionate gypsy, with Murvyn Vye as one of her gypsy beaus who initially resents Milland. As silly as he looks in the dark make-up and earrings (like Othello on acid), Milland gives a subtle performance. In spite of being so silly, this is one of those truly enjoyable war films that may not represent any type of reality but is never dull. The title song is one of those odd musical moments in films that just come out of nowhere and makes you wonder if Gene Wilder was off in some distant castle bring a monster back to life.

    It just doesn't get any better than Golden Earrings! Ray Milland and Marlene Dietrich were fantastic on the screen together in this one and the story line/plot was highly entertaining, full of suspense, action and drama that kept me on the edge of my seat. It's one of those movies that will have you laughing, holding your breath in anticipation of what might happen next as well as gasping when it does!! Ray Milland is a British Intelligence officer who becomes a POW sole survivor seeking the secret of a poison gas formula meant for the Nazis. After escaping he meets up with Dietrich who is a gypsy and helps him stay alive during their travels while pursuing the formula. The real magic though is the romance which is developing between the two. It is just so much fun watching the transformation of Ray Milland from a stuffy British officer into the character he becomes that keeps you entertained. Marlene knows that she will never meet anybody quite like him ever again and she falls for him almost immediately. With an excellent supporting cast and the gorgeous scenery I gotta admit, I just adored everything about this movie and I could easily tell you the entire film but I dislike watching a movie someone has described in detail so I am going to stop here and just say PLEASE, PLEASE do not think twice about popping the popcorn, pulling up your favorite easy chair and plunking this one into the DVD player because you are in for a treat and a wonderful time! In my opinion Golden Earrings is what movie making was meant to be like! Enjoy!

    Marlene Dietrich plays an European Gypsy woman in Pre-World War II Europe. Ray Milland played the British officer Denistoun who is on a mission. Ray Milland and Marlene Dietrich are excellent, entertaining, and enjoyable in the film. The story is fine and could have used more work but the Milland's British gentleman turned Gypsy in order to escape the Nazis does a fantastic job. It's interesting to see a character like Denistoun to transform into a Gypsy. The ending is worth watching the film. The film doesn't address the Nazi war crimes. European Gypsies were also targeted and persecuted by the Nazis during World War II. Still, this film is entertaining to watch and suspenseful. The cast is first rate in the Hollywood studio system factory where films were made faster even with mediocre scripts. Still, this film is one of my favorites with Marlene Dietrich.

    I have thoroughly enjoyed this film. I believe it has a magic touch,I see it as a wonderful fairy tale, with only minimal historical or topographical attachments, without paying any attention to plausibility or credibility or any such restricting considerations. It is the story of two completely dissimilar human beings, that experience a love above and beyond realism or logic,a love that unites them to the mysterious forces of nature, and leads them to create their own universe of beauty and happiness. Ray Milland was so wonderful (and so sexy) in this role, that requires a fine balance between comedy, drama and fairy tale stuff, and Marlene Dietrich had, for once, a warm and sincere role, that she plays to perfection, the prototype of a woman in love, who does everything for her man. I know the rumors about their mutual dislike, but honestly they matched perfectly together in this movie and this only proves how professionals both of them were.

    Colonel Denistoun (Ray Milland) recounts an episode that happened at the outbreak of WW2 when he and Richard Byrd (Bruce Lester) escaped from German custody where they were being held as spies. They split up and make their way to Professor Krosigk (Reinhold Schunzel) who has a formula for chemical weapons that needs to be smuggled out. We follow Denistoun's journey as he meets with Lydia (Marlene Dietrich) and adopts her gypsy ways... This film is OK but nothing more. In fact it is quite dull in parts. Marlene Dietrich is unconvincing as a gypsy as is Ray Milland. Dietrich, however, still manages to bring her character to life - she's good at the humorous moments, eg, no messing around trying to kiss Milland - and brings an energy to her role, while Milland is likable but nothing more. There are rare tense moments, eg, whenever the Germans appear and the film needed far more of their inclusion. It just dribbled along for most of the duration. One of the best things about the film is Zoltan's (Murvyn Vye) deep voice. Zoltan looks slightly weird but is more convincing as a gypsy. He sings the title song - some nonsense about gold earrings and love. Golden earrings...!!??.....you're either a chav or a homosexual if that is what you wear on your ears.....NOT a gypsy man.

    Golden Earrings (1947) A tough movie to love, but the best parts of it--or the best part, that is, known as Marlene Dietrich--make it easy to like. The actions scenes, the chitchat, even the opening scenes where men talk with bizarre astonishment a man's pierced ears, are often unconvincing. Even the core plot, looking for a key German scientist before it's too late, stumbles over its own clich&eacute;s. And even worse, a key weakness is the lead male, the low key and unemphatic Ray Milland. Two years after the end of the war, when this film was made, there must have been a huge appetite for variations on stories about resisting the Nazis. This is a bizarre and highly unlikely one, not because Gypsies weren't involved behind the scenes in the action, but because the idea of a single gypsy woman taking in an Englishman who has to hide, for unexplained reasons, in Germany even though there is no war, is a stretch. (His mission is clear, but why an Englishman has to be undercover isn't historically clear to me.) But this is what we have, and Dietrich, who is German and began her acting in Germany but by this point was long part of Hollywood, plays a very fictional Gypsy. She is used a little like she was in the famous Josef von Sternberg movies, for her "aura," which she had plenty of. Most of the movie follows a series of encounters and difficulties with arrogant Nazis and between themselves. Much of the filming is at night, which is dramatic, and there are scenes of Gypsy camps that are part of a long line in Hollywood films. There is also an interesting followup of sorts from Hitchcock's "Notorious" the previous year, in the use of two key German archetypes, Reinhold Schunzel and Ivan Triesault. This is focusing on the details, which is what you have to do. Or just pull back and see a lovely romance unfold.

    Mitchell Leisen loved the long flashbacks :"hold back the dawn" was a story the hero told the director himself;" to each his own" began with a shot of a middle age lady whose misfortunes were told ;" no man of her own" ,faithful to the novel ,began with a "give up the fight" feeling .He had also tackled the fantasy genre in "death takes a holiday". "Golden earrings" is a long flashback,blending spy thriller scenes in a just-before-WW2 Germany with snatches of supernatural thrown in :the heroine knew his beloved one would come (she's a fortune teller anyway) and ,most amazing scene,the hero himself through her contact becomes a clairvoyant,seeing his mate's future in the palm of his hand. I do not put,however ,"golden earrings " in the same league as the movies I mention above;I do not think it's underrated cause its flaws are glaring:first of all,like the Jews,the gypsies were persecuted and sent to concentration camps by the Nazis before and during the war ;so it is absolutely impossible to believe they are allowed -although one of the officers says they are an inferior race-to enter the scientist's desirable mansion to tell fortunes.Besides,everybody speaks English in Germany ,only some soldiers mumble a few German sentences and that's it. I do like Ray Milland -a certainly underrated actor ,sadly remembered by too many people as the villain in "love story" ,his worst role- and Marlene Dietrich is arguably a fascinating actress ,but as Mardi Gras gypsies ,they cannot be taken seriously .

    It is hard to picture a movie about a love story between a British spy and a gypsy. The plot is predictable. The characters are predictable; even my favorite Zoltan who seems to be playing in a different movie. Marlene Dietrich again is stuck in a formulaic romance where she plays the exotic female who drives men crazy. This is not Ray Miland's best role either. His British accent is at best inconsistent. He plays the heroic agent fighting the evil Nazis. Overall, this movie is really nothing but a WW II retread with a romance thrown into the mix for good(?) measure. This movie is mindless entertainment that will be quickly forgotten.

    Those reviewers who have complained that this movie lacks plausibility or has problems of construction are missing the point. This is a wonderfully camp romance, with plenty of Play, gypsies! Dance, gypsies! music, that both sends up exotic love stories and celebrates them. Buttoned-up Ray Milland makes an amusing foil for a Dietrich with black hair, tattered scarves, and tons of jewelry. The character's eagerness to feed Milland and look after him more closely resembles the good German hausfrau Dietrich was off the set than her mannered vamp roles. Censorship being in force, it's made clear that they share a caravan on platonic terms only, with Milland fighting off Dietrich's advances with a determination remarkable for a heterosexual bachelor who might be killed any day. His only excuse is that she smells, so perhaps a stuffy, fastidious Englishman might indeed be put off. In the small role of Milland's young companion on his secret mission, Bruce Lester adds a note of camp of a different kind. We are told at the beginning that he hero-worships Milland, and indeed he rather fawns on him. When, after they are separated, he meets Milland, now transformed into a brown-skinned gypsy with a shirt open to the waist, his glowing appreciation of the disguise even further suggests that not only Dietrich is romantically infatuated with Milland. Despite the wonderfully improbable characters and sequence of events, the growing love of Milland for Dietrich and his acceptance of the non-rational aspects of life is rather touching. And when, on their last night alone before he escapes, he says that each of them now contain half of the other, the two have become one, and then darkness falls, I think we can assume that the censor decided to give them a break! One goof--at the beginning, Milland, who is supposed to be English, refers to a lieutenant, using the American pronunciation. (The English say "leftenant.") Since Milland was British, he must have been saying it that way because the American movie-makers feared that American audiences would be distracted and confused by the British style.

    When you're asking yourself pertinent questions as a film unspools before you it's usually a sign that something is sadly amiss. The first question I asked myself here is WHY, Quentin Reynolds. Okay, the film is going to be a flashback ergo Ray Milland needs someone to tell his story to but given that he is telling it to a fellow passenger on a flight to Paris it could have been any fictional creation. Given the date of the movie, 1947, it may well be that Reynolds was familiar as a war correspondent but the fact that Milland is telling Reynolds and not Gregory Schmearcase adds nothing to the story. Next question; as stated, Milland tells his story on a flight to Paris, again, WHY. The story he is relating took place in Germany and that is where his gypsy lover, Dietrich, is waiting for him. So why not a flight to Berlin, Frankfort, Stuttgart or whatever. Leading on from this, one minute he is on the plane - en route, remember, to Paris - in the next shot he is deep in the German countryside rendezvousing with Dietrich and her caravan. How did he get there? At the beginning of the film, set in September, 1939 - war is declared even as we watch - Milland is a British agent, travelling with a colleague and intent on obtaining a formula from a German chemist. Milland and colleague are arrested, escape and don German uniforms. Having sunk the car in which they escaped, they separate after arranging a rendezvous near a signpost. Milland meets Dietrich, a gypsy, and travels in her caravan. When they reach the rendezvous Milland's colleague turns up in full Bavarian gear and riding a bicycle. How did he acquire these things. It's little things like that, plus the total lack of chemistry between Milland and Dietrich, the fact that director Mitchell Liesen is totally out of his element, being more at home with sophisticated comedy and elaborate sets that tended to mar any enjoyment the movie may have had

Dance, gypsies! music, that both sends up exotic love stories and celebrates them. Buttoned-up Ray Milland makes an amusing foil for a Dietrich with black hair, tattered scarves, and tons of jewelry. The character's eagerness to feed Milland and look after him more closely resembles the good German hausfrau Dietrich was off the set than her mannered vamp roles. Censorship being in force, it's made clear that they share a caravan on platonic terms only, with Milland fighting off Dietrich's advances with a determination remarkable for a heterosexual bachelor who might be killed any day. His only excuse is that she smells, so perhaps a stuffy, fastidious Englishman might indeed be put off. In the small role of Milland's young companion on his secret mission, Bruce Lester adds a note of camp of a different kind. We are told at the beginning that he hero-worships Milland, and indeed he rather fawns on him. When, after they are separated, he meets Milland, now transformed into a brown-skinned gypsy with a shirt open to the waist, his glowing appreciation of the disguise even further suggests that not only Dietrich is romantically infatuated with Milland. Despite the wonderfully improbable characters and sequence of events, the growing love of Milland for Dietrich and his acceptance of the non-rational aspects of life is rather touching. And when, on their last night alone before he escapes, he says that each of them now contain half of the other, the two have become one, and then darkness falls, I think we can assume that the censor decided to give them a break! One goof--at the beginning, Milland, who is supposed to be English, refers to a lieutenant, using the American pronunciation. (The English say "leftenant.") Since Milland was British, he must have been saying it that way because the American movie-makers feared that American audiences would be distracted and confused by the British style.

    When you're asking yourself pertinent questions as a film unspools before you it's usually a sign that something is sadly amiss. The first question I asked myself here is WHY, Quentin Reynolds. Okay, the film is going to be a flashback ergo Ray Milland needs someone to tell his story to but given that he is telling it to a fellow passenger on a flight to Paris it could have been any fictional creation. Given the date of the movie, 1947, it may well be that Reynolds was familiar as a war correspondent but the fact that Milland is telling Reynolds and not Gregory Schmearcase adds nothing to the story. Next question; as stated, Milland tells his story on a flight to Paris, again, WHY. The story he is relating took place in Germany and that is where his gypsy lover, Dietrich, is waiting for him. So why not a flight to Berlin, Frankfort, Stuttgart or whatever. Leading on from this, one minute he is on the plane - en route, remember, to Paris - in the next shot he is deep in the German countryside rendezvousing with Dietrich and her caravan. How did he get there? At the beginning of the film, set in September, 1939 - war is declared even as we watch - Milland is a British agent, travelling with a colleague and intent on obtaining a formula from a German chemist. Milland and colleague are arrested, escape and don German uniforms. Having sunk the car in which they escaped, they separate after arranging a rendezvous near a signpost. Milland meets Dietrich, a gypsy, and travels in her caravan. When they reach the rendezvous Milland's colleague turns up in full Bavarian gear and riding a bicycle. How did he acquire these things. It's little things like that, plus the total lack of chemistry between Milland and Dietrich, the fact that director Mitchell Liesen is totally out of his element, being more at home with sophisticated comedy and elaborate sets that tended to mar any enjoyment the movie may have had
