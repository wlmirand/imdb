    The entire movie, you are never sure if the children are truly haunted, or if the nanny is haunted. She could be insane. The children could be just messing about with her, trying to scare her, sadly not knowing she's insane. The movie is really through her eyes, and if you think "she's insane" the movie suddenly becomes so much more horrible than a ghost story. One pictures her being sent off for murder, to a horrible Victorian insane asylum after the movie ends. If nothing else, you see she's changed, and ghosts or not, she's not normal anymore. Some adaptations of this story try to leave out the ghosts. You don't see them so you are left with more of a question about the sanity of the nanny. This movie adaptation is quite good as you get all the input the nanny does. It just slowly begins to dawn upon you, especially with the climatic end, that she could be insane. If she's insane, it's far more ghastly than ghosts, and you feel sorry for the children. It's a movie adaptation that tries to fool you, it plays on your emotions, but a skeptic can especially enjoy this movie. Real ghosts aren't nearly the danger that people that believe in ghosts can be. A rewatching, with the nanny as the "bad guy" scares people far more than when they first watched it thinking it a simply ghost story. The Innocents are the children, ghosts or nanny, they are simply playthings for adults in this movie.

    One of the original haunted house and its haunted history movies, Innocents, does an interesting difference to the later haunted house adoptions. Although the plot has become nearby a clich&eacute; in the later horror movies and it is not too hard to guess how the events turn out, the movie still feels refreshing. One of the main reasons for that is the clever use of the camera and not to rely on silly shock effects like in today's horror movies. Also Deborah Kerr was a joy to watch and when she gets in the middle of the things, I actually felt sorry for her. That is something that doesn't happen with today's silly horror movie babysitters. Innocents is from the beginning to the end an interesting, clever and amusing movie to watch.

    The story is something to ponder about. Although, none of the sequences boggle, frighten or at least put the wind up. Nothing. The bungalow is supposed to be haunted, but the ghosts in here seem to be in love. Well, their affection certainly won't cause anything. The setup is made to be suspense-filled, but nothing yields out of it. You anticipate a gruesome climax like a crescendo in a symphony, but you are let down, terribly. The casting is very good, with the lead children generating enough mystique to keep you on tenterhooks. But that's all. They, in fact, annoy you over time. Deborah Kerr is very expressional. The artist who played chaperon impresses. But, the writers are to be blamed for this botched attempt in horror genre. With the climax on board, the whole structure is daft. The dialogs spun out ridicule, the sequences result in scorn. Oh, exasperation is the only thing you garner. 3.4/10. BOTTOM LINE: Not even passes the litmus test for a genre so loved by people. Not recommended! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Profanity/Nudity/Foreplay: No | Vulgarity: Very Mild | Sex: Implied | Violence/Gore: No | Smoking/Alcohol/Drugs: No

    I wish to write this review as I do not believe many of the reviews for this film have been written by a skeptic. My viewpoint will be a little different than the usual review's take on matters due to that reason. I hope this review is interesting to the reader, but the reader must realize my different viewpoint. Despite the movies and plethora of TV shows treating the existence of ghosts as a "given" there actually is no conclusive evidence for such things. The various TV shows that depict ghost hunting are bemusing, at most; most probably delusional, as they will show people equipped with thermometers, emf meters, infrared cameras, and other such specialized equipment looking for ghosts yet one wonders just how can one prepare oneself to look for something if that something has never even been proved to exist in the first place? And, there is no surprise, at least to me, when they never find anything conclusive. Yet, the belief in ghosts must have some foundation. Somebody, somewhere, must have experienced or seen something that is "ghostlike". And, this movie deals with that position. Here, a live in "babysitter" (modern term for Deborah Kerr's role) experiences some things that are not easily explainable. Yet, nobody else seems to experience what she is experiencing. Or, do they but don't tell her? She has two young children to look after in a beautiful but rather empty Victorian mansion. The children are brother and sister and provide a sort of emotional mirror to a grown man and adult woman who had died fairly recently in this place and whom the children knew. The babysitter has an older woman to help her and this woman tells of the love of the now dead lovers. But, are the dead lovers gone or still there. The babysitter sees these "ghosts" in a frightening manner that seems to indicate no doubt of their existence...but nobody else does!! Not told in this story but implied is the fact that this babysitter ("governess" as they called them back then) is unmarried and around 40. Certainly she has some emotional issues over that! Though Deborah Kerr said this her finest role, her physical beauty was such that nobody could imagine her character was unmarried for lack of attention from men. In the original story the governess was probably more of a frustrated "plain Jane" who had issues with that fact and probably projected herself into the story of the dead lovers for that reason. So, is the governess imagining the ghosts or are there actually remnants of people now dead still lurking in that area? While watching the movie and trying to answer that question be prepared for some frightening events and sheer emotional terror. No great special effects like you see in modern films; just suspense and terror. They don't make these sort of films now like they used to so it is well worth viewing for a couple of hours.

    There has been much discussion over the years as to whether this film or Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING (1963) qualify as Hollywood's greatest ghost movie. I have to vote for THE HAUNTING. Yes, THE INNOCENTS is a stylistic masterpiece, but somehow, every time I watch it, THE INNOCENTS seems to me a series of macabre vignettes brilliantly realized. But the narrative of THE HAUNTING seems to hold together better. Jack Clayton's direction and Freddie Francis' camera-work for THE INNOCENTS are indeed stunning,and the kids are great. Yet I'm never compelled by the actual ectoplasmic motives and find myself irritated by Deborah Kerr's overly actress-y, stagey performance. But, hey, it's an impressive film nonetheless.

    I love this movie! Every now and then, you'll hear about a horror movie that is generally regarded by everyone to be a masterpiece. This is one of them. If there are critics of this movie, then they are few and far between. This is a movie that EVERY fan of horror needs to see. I don't think I'll ever be able to do it justice, but that's not gonna stop me from trying. Miss Giddens is a beautiful women, and is offered a job as Governess for a wealthy family with two children out in the country side. She soon starts to suspect that something is not quite right, and that the house and possible even the children may be haunted. I'll say no more, the less you know about this movie, the better! So, here's why I adore this movie. It's timeless! Even today, certain scenes are bound to make your skin crawl and keep you up at night. The subtly is brilliant in really unnerving the viewers that it makes it so memorable! Just mentioning this movie is bound to have people humming that or so famous tune! Even in the opening, hearing this haunting theme play before even seeing the opening credits or the production logo! Absolutely haunting! The ambiguity! This often fails in movies, but here, they got it just right. There are so many different interpretations to this movie, you could discuss it for hours! In fact, you probably will. The acting is exceptional! The two child actors were sensational, I cannot praise them enough. Deborah Kerr, as Miss Giddens was amazing too. A really emotional performance, and one you're not likely to forget. All of this helps to create an atmosphere that is chilling to the bone! The symbolism. This movie is full of it. I've watched this movie two times now, and even on the second time, did I pick up so many things that I missed the first. Some of this symbolism adds to certain interpretations. But it mainly adds to the creepy atmosphere that is The Innocents. Finally, the ending! My God what an ending! For a fair review, one should examine the faults of a movie, but there just isn't any. To me, this film is horror perfection! I could go on and on about it. It really is such a creepy and memorable film and one that I can not recommend highly enough! If you have not seen this movie, please check it out, I promise you will not be disappointed.

    One word to describe this film: boring. Seeing that this movie is considered "one of the best classic ghost stories of all times", I decided to see it. A bit disappointed, actually. Don't think it deserves all the praise. I'm not fond of black and white movies in general, and this was no different. Is it a joke that this is classed as "horror"? There wasn't ONE scary or suspenseful moment in the entire movie. Not one. It wouldn't even pass for a thriller. Maybe a drama... Is there such a genre as "ghost drama"? If not, it should be invented just for this movie. Maybe, back in the 60s, something like this was considered scary, but now it's just... boring. Yes, the acting was convincing, the story/characters were developed properly, and the script was well-written. But this was nowhere near enough to make the movie entertaining. It's watchable, but nothing spectacular. I was quite unimpressed with the ending also. Very poorly constructed, unimaginative, and not at all gratifying.

    In 1800s England Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr) is hired as a governess for two children--Flora (Pamela Franklin) and Miles (Martin Stephens)--in a huge house in the middle of nowhere. She starts to see ghosts and comes to believe that they're trying to possess the children. Are the ghosts real or is she going mad? Or are the kids playing games with her? The scariest thing about this is that the question is still unanswered at the end. There's evidence for each resolution. Any of the conclusions are disturbing. The acting is perfect. Kerr said this was her best performance and she's right. She plays it beautifully with just the tiniest touch of hysteria so you're never sure if what's she seeing is real. Stephens and Franklin match her--especially Stephens. That kid is downright creepy and the looks he gives her are disturbing. The ghosts are shown but sparingly. They're also downright terrifying. The first appearance of Quint(Peter Wyngarde) is enough to give you nightmares! You see his face slowly appear out of the darkness staring at Kerr. No blaring music or any sound at all. Just dead quiet making it even more scary. It's shot in beautiful black and white and CinemaScope which helps. You have to see this in wide screen or letter-boxed. Also there's a literate script and great direction. A powerful movie and one of the scariest ghost stories ever put on film.

    I loved how this movie tries to creepy out even before the movie as started as the start of the movie, you get the Really Creepy Kids voice. That is one hell of the way to the start a movie like this, I creepy factor dose not stop there at all. As the movie keeps going you may thing that Kids how doing something as do act a little strange in some scenes. I love this very dark settling movie, there are some very creepy scenes in this movie, the laughing near end of the movie was very creepy. I loved the ending of this movie, I clad that is one reason this might never see a remake, I can't see that do that ending now-er days The acting was outstanding from the whole cast 10 out of 10

    beautiful. precise. seductive. powerful. profound. an adaptation but with a special flavor. because it is a Gothic story and more. because Deborah Kerr does a splendid role and atmosphere - creepy, mysterious, dark, credible - is an admirable work. it is a slice from a period with precise manner to create tension. to make details as a delicate pieces of embroidery.and the acting - subtle, precious, sparkles of nuances - is touching and real impressive.a film like a memorable experience. the art of director, the amazing young actors, the house, the presence of Megs Jenkins, the ghosts and, sure, the music, the obsessive music are ingredients of this movie. must see it ! only for discover a style to present a story. and, for the warm air of past.

    I loved how this movie tries to creepy out even before the movie as started as the start of the movie, you get the Really Creepy Kids voice. That is one hell of the way to the start a movie like this, I creepy factor dose not stop there at all. As the movie keeps going you may thing that Kids how doing something as do act a little strange in some scenes. I love this very dark settling movie, there are some very creepy scenes in this movie, the laughing near end of the movie was very creepy. I loved the ending of this movie, I clad that is one reason this might never see a remake, I can't see that do that ending now-er days The acting was outstanding from the whole cast 10 out of 10

    beautiful. precise. seductive. powerful. profound. an adaptation but with a special flavor. because it is a Gothic story and more. because Deborah Kerr does a splendid role and atmosphere - creepy, mysterious, dark, credible - is an admirable work. it is a slice from a period with precise manner to create tension. to make details as a delicate pieces of embroidery.and the acting - subtle, precious, sparkles of nuances - is touching and real impressive.a film like a memorable experience. the art of director, the amazing young actors, the house, the presence of Megs Jenkins, the ghosts and, sure, the music, the obsessive music are ingredients of this movie. must see it ! only for discover a style to present a story. and, for the warm air of past.

    The entire movie, you are never sure if the children are truly haunted, or if the nanny is haunted. She could be insane. The children could be just messing about with her, trying to scare her, sadly not knowing she's insane. The movie is really through her eyes, and if you think "she's insane" the movie suddenly becomes so much more horrible than a ghost story. One pictures her being sent off for murder, to a horrible Victorian insane asylum after the movie ends. If nothing else, you see she's changed, and ghosts or not, she's not normal anymore. Some adaptations of this story try to leave out the ghosts. You don't see them so you are left with more of a question about the sanity of the nanny. This movie adaptation is quite good as you get all the input the nanny does. It just slowly begins to dawn upon you, especially with the climatic end, that she could be insane. If she's insane, it's far more ghastly than ghosts, and you feel sorry for the children. It's a movie adaptation that tries to fool you, it plays on your emotions, but a skeptic can especially enjoy this movie. Real ghosts aren't nearly the danger that people that believe in ghosts can be. A rewatching, with the nanny as the "bad guy" scares people far more than when they first watched it thinking it a simply ghost story. The Innocents are the children, ghosts or nanny, they are simply playthings for adults in this movie.

    One of the original haunted house and its haunted history movies, Innocents, does an interesting difference to the later haunted house adoptions. Although the plot has become nearby a clich&eacute; in the later horror movies and it is not too hard to guess how the events turn out, the movie still feels refreshing. One of the main reasons for that is the clever use of the camera and not to rely on silly shock effects like in today's horror movies. Also Deborah Kerr was a joy to watch and when she gets in the middle of the things, I actually felt sorry for her. That is something that doesn't happen with today's silly horror movie babysitters. Innocents is from the beginning to the end an interesting, clever and amusing movie to watch.

    The story is something to ponder about. Although, none of the sequences boggle, frighten or at least put the wind up. Nothing. The bungalow is supposed to be haunted, but the ghosts in here seem to be in love. Well, their affection certainly won't cause anything. The setup is made to be suspense-filled, but nothing yields out of it. You anticipate a gruesome climax like a crescendo in a symphony, but you are let down, terribly. The casting is very good, with the lead children generating enough mystique to keep you on tenterhooks. But that's all. They, in fact, annoy you over time. Deborah Kerr is very expressional. The artist who played chaperon impresses. But, the writers are to be blamed for this botched attempt in horror genre. With the climax on board, the whole structure is daft. The dialogs spun out ridicule, the sequences result in scorn. Oh, exasperation is the only thing you garner. 3.4/10. BOTTOM LINE: Not even passes the litmus test for a genre so loved by people. Not recommended! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Profanity/Nudity/Foreplay: No | Vulgarity: Very Mild | Sex: Implied | Violence/Gore: No | Smoking/Alcohol/Drugs: No

    I wish to write this review as I do not believe many of the reviews for this film have been written by a skeptic. My viewpoint will be a little different than the usual review's take on matters due to that reason. I hope this review is interesting to the reader, but the reader must realize my different viewpoint. Despite the movies and plethora of TV shows treating the existence of ghosts as a "given" there actually is no conclusive evidence for such things. The various TV shows that depict ghost hunting are bemusing, at most; most probably delusional, as they will show people equipped with thermometers, emf meters, infrared cameras, and other such specialized equipment looking for ghosts yet one wonders just how can one prepare oneself to look for something if that something has never even been proved to exist in the first place? And, there is no surprise, at least to me, when they never find anything conclusive. Yet, the belief in ghosts must have some foundation. Somebody, somewhere, must have experienced or seen something that is "ghostlike". And, this movie deals with that position. Here, a live in "babysitter" (modern term for Deborah Kerr's role) experiences some things that are not easily explainable. Yet, nobody else seems to experience what she is experiencing. Or, do they but don't tell her? She has two young children to look after in a beautiful but rather empty Victorian mansion. The children are brother and sister and provide a sort of emotional mirror to a grown man and adult woman who had died fairly recently in this place and whom the children knew. The babysitter has an older woman to help her and this woman tells of the love of the now dead lovers. But, are the dead lovers gone or still there. The babysitter sees these "ghosts" in a frightening manner that seems to indicate no doubt of their existence...but nobody else does!! Not told in this story but implied is the fact that this babysitter ("governess" as they called them back then) is unmarried and around 40. Certainly she has some emotional issues over that! Though Deborah Kerr said this her finest role, her physical beauty was such that nobody could imagine her character was unmarried for lack of attention from men. In the original story the governess was probably more of a frustrated "plain Jane" who had issues with that fact and probably projected herself into the story of the dead lovers for that reason. So, is the governess imagining the ghosts or are there actually remnants of people now dead still lurking in that area? While watching the movie and trying to answer that question be prepared for some frightening events and sheer emotional terror. No great special effects like you see in modern films; just suspense and terror. They don't make these sort of films now like they used to so it is well worth viewing for a couple of hours.

    There has been much discussion over the years as to whether this film or Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING (1963) qualify as Hollywood's greatest ghost movie. I have to vote for THE HAUNTING. Yes, THE INNOCENTS is a stylistic masterpiece, but somehow, every time I watch it, THE INNOCENTS seems to me a series of macabre vignettes brilliantly realized. But the narrative of THE HAUNTING seems to hold together better. Jack Clayton's direction and Freddie Francis' camera-work for THE INNOCENTS are indeed stunning,and the kids are great. Yet I'm never compelled by the actual ectoplasmic motives and find myself irritated by Deborah Kerr's overly actress-y, stagey performance. But, hey, it's an impressive film nonetheless.

    I love this movie! Every now and then, you'll hear about a horror movie that is generally regarded by everyone to be a masterpiece. This is one of them. If there are critics of this movie, then they are few and far between. This is a movie that EVERY fan of horror needs to see. I don't think I'll ever be able to do it justice, but that's not gonna stop me from trying. Miss Giddens is a beautiful women, and is offered a job as Governess for a wealthy family with two children out in the country side. She soon starts to suspect that something is not quite right, and that the house and possible even the children may be haunted. I'll say no more, the less you know about this movie, the better! So, here's why I adore this movie. It's timeless! Even today, certain scenes are bound to make your skin crawl and keep you up at night. The subtly is brilliant in really unnerving the viewers that it makes it so memorable! Just mentioning this movie is bound to have people humming that or so famous tune! Even in the opening, hearing this haunting theme play before even seeing the opening credits or the production logo! Absolutely haunting! The ambiguity! This often fails in movies, but here, they got it just right. There are so many different interpretations to this movie, you could discuss it for hours! In fact, you probably will. The acting is exceptional! The two child actors were sensational, I cannot praise them enough. Deborah Kerr, as Miss Giddens was amazing too. A really emotional performance, and one you're not likely to forget. All of this helps to create an atmosphere that is chilling to the bone! The symbolism. This movie is full of it. I've watched this movie two times now, and even on the second time, did I pick up so many things that I missed the first. Some of this symbolism adds to certain interpretations. But it mainly adds to the creepy atmosphere that is The Innocents. Finally, the ending! My God what an ending! For a fair review, one should examine the faults of a movie, but there just isn't any. To me, this film is horror perfection! I could go on and on about it. It really is such a creepy and memorable film and one that I can not recommend highly enough! If you have not seen this movie, please check it out, I promise you will not be disappointed.

    One word to describe this film: boring. Seeing that this movie is considered "one of the best classic ghost stories of all times", I decided to see it. A bit disappointed, actually. Don't think it deserves all the praise. I'm not fond of black and white movies in general, and this was no different. Is it a joke that this is classed as "horror"? There wasn't ONE scary or suspenseful moment in the entire movie. Not one. It wouldn't even pass for a thriller. Maybe a drama... Is there such a genre as "ghost drama"? If not, it should be invented just for this movie. Maybe, back in the 60s, something like this was considered scary, but now it's just... boring. Yes, the acting was convincing, the story/characters were developed properly, and the script was well-written. But this was nowhere near enough to make the movie entertaining. It's watchable, but nothing spectacular. I was quite unimpressed with the ending also. Very poorly constructed, unimaginative, and not at all gratifying.

    In 1800s England Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr) is hired as a governess for two children--Flora (Pamela Franklin) and Miles (Martin Stephens)--in a huge house in the middle of nowhere. She starts to see ghosts and comes to believe that they're trying to possess the children. Are the ghosts real or is she going mad? Or are the kids playing games with her? The scariest thing about this is that the question is still unanswered at the end. There's evidence for each resolution. Any of the conclusions are disturbing. The acting is perfect. Kerr said this was her best performance and she's right. She plays it beautifully with just the tiniest touch of hysteria so you're never sure if what's she seeing is real. Stephens and Franklin match her--especially Stephens. That kid is downright creepy and the looks he gives her are disturbing. The ghosts are shown but sparingly. They're also downright terrifying. The first appearance of Quint(Peter Wyngarde) is enough to give you nightmares! You see his face slowly appear out of the darkness staring at Kerr. No blaring music or any sound at all. Just dead quiet making it even more scary. It's shot in beautiful black and white and CinemaScope which helps. You have to see this in wide screen or letter-boxed. Also there's a literate script and great direction. A powerful movie and one of the scariest ghost stories ever put on film.

    I loved how this movie tries to creepy out even before the movie as started as the start of the movie, you get the Really Creepy Kids voice. That is one hell of the way to the start a movie like this, I creepy factor dose not stop there at all. As the movie keeps going you may thing that Kids how doing something as do act a little strange in some scenes. I love this very dark settling movie, there are some very creepy scenes in this movie, the laughing near end of the movie was very creepy. I loved the ending of this movie, I clad that is one reason this might never see a remake, I can't see that do that ending now-er days The acting was outstanding from the whole cast 10 out of 10

    beautiful. precise. seductive. powerful. profound. an adaptation but with a special flavor. because it is a Gothic story and more. because Deborah Kerr does a splendid role and atmosphere - creepy, mysterious, dark, credible - is an admirable work. it is a slice from a period with precise manner to create tension. to make details as a delicate pieces of embroidery.and the acting - subtle, precious, sparkles of nuances - is touching and real impressive.a film like a memorable experience. the art of director, the amazing young actors, the house, the presence of Megs Jenkins, the ghosts and, sure, the music, the obsessive music are ingredients of this movie. must see it ! only for discover a style to present a story. and, for the warm air of past.

    The entire movie, you are never sure if the children are truly haunted, or if the nanny is haunted. She could be insane. The children could be just messing about with her, trying to scare her, sadly not knowing she's insane. The movie is really through her eyes, and if you think "she's insane" the movie suddenly becomes so much more horrible than a ghost story. One pictures her being sent off for murder, to a horrible Victorian insane asylum after the movie ends. If nothing else, you see she's changed, and ghosts or not, she's not normal anymore. Some adaptations of this story try to leave out the ghosts. You don't see them so you are left with more of a question about the sanity of the nanny. This movie adaptation is quite good as you get all the input the nanny does. It just slowly begins to dawn upon you, especially with the climatic end, that she could be insane. If she's insane, it's far more ghastly than ghosts, and you feel sorry for the children. It's a movie adaptation that tries to fool you, it plays on your emotions, but a skeptic can especially enjoy this movie. Real ghosts aren't nearly the danger that people that believe in ghosts can be. A rewatching, with the nanny as the "bad guy" scares people far more than when they first watched it thinking it a simply ghost story. The Innocents are the children, ghosts or nanny, they are simply playthings for adults in this movie.

    One of the original haunted house and its haunted history movies, Innocents, does an interesting difference to the later haunted house adoptions. Although the plot has become nearby a clich&eacute; in the later horror movies and it is not too hard to guess how the events turn out, the movie still feels refreshing. One of the main reasons for that is the clever use of the camera and not to rely on silly shock effects like in today's horror movies. Also Deborah Kerr was a joy to watch and when she gets in the middle of the things, I actually felt sorry for her. That is something that doesn't happen with today's silly horror movie babysitters. Innocents is from the beginning to the end an interesting, clever and amusing movie to watch.

    The story is something to ponder about. Although, none of the sequences boggle, frighten or at least put the wind up. Nothing. The bungalow is supposed to be haunted, but the ghosts in here seem to be in love. Well, their affection certainly won't cause anything. The setup is made to be suspense-filled, but nothing yields out of it. You anticipate a gruesome climax like a crescendo in a symphony, but you are let down, terribly. The casting is very good, with the lead children generating enough mystique to keep you on tenterhooks. But that's all. They, in fact, annoy you over time. Deborah Kerr is very expressional. The artist who played chaperon impresses. But, the writers are to be blamed for this botched attempt in horror genre. With the climax on board, the whole structure is daft. The dialogs spun out ridicule, the sequences result in scorn. Oh, exasperation is the only thing you garner. 3.4/10. BOTTOM LINE: Not even passes the litmus test for a genre so loved by people. Not recommended! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Profanity/Nudity/Foreplay: No | Vulgarity: Very Mild | Sex: Implied | Violence/Gore: No | Smoking/Alcohol/Drugs: No

    I wish to write this review as I do not believe many of the reviews for this film have been written by a skeptic. My viewpoint will be a little different than the usual review's take on matters due to that reason. I hope this review is interesting to the reader, but the reader must realize my different viewpoint. Despite the movies and plethora of TV shows treating the existence of ghosts as a "given" there actually is no conclusive evidence for such things. The various TV shows that depict ghost hunting are bemusing, at most; most probably delusional, as they will show people equipped with thermometers, emf meters, infrared cameras, and other such specialized equipment looking for ghosts yet one wonders just how can one prepare oneself to look for something if that something has never even been proved to exist in the first place? And, there is no surprise, at least to me, when they never find anything conclusive. Yet, the belief in ghosts must have some foundation. Somebody, somewhere, must have experienced or seen something that is "ghostlike". And, this movie deals with that position. Here, a live in "babysitter" (modern term for Deborah Kerr's role) experiences some things that are not easily explainable. Yet, nobody else seems to experience what she is experiencing. Or, do they but don't tell her? She has two young children to look after in a beautiful but rather empty Victorian mansion. The children are brother and sister and provide a sort of emotional mirror to a grown man and adult woman who had died fairly recently in this place and whom the children knew. The babysitter has an older woman to help her and this woman tells of the love of the now dead lovers. But, are the dead lovers gone or still there. The babysitter sees these "ghosts" in a frightening manner that seems to indicate no doubt of their existence...but nobody else does!! Not told in this story but implied is the fact that this babysitter ("governess" as they called them back then) is unmarried and around 40. Certainly she has some emotional issues over that! Though Deborah Kerr said this her finest role, her physical beauty was such that nobody could imagine her character was unmarried for lack of attention from men. In the original story the governess was probably more of a frustrated "plain Jane" who had issues with that fact and probably projected herself into the story of the dead lovers for that reason. So, is the governess imagining the ghosts or are there actually remnants of people now dead still lurking in that area? While watching the movie and trying to answer that question be prepared for some frightening events and sheer emotional terror. No great special effects like you see in modern films; just suspense and terror. They don't make these sort of films now like they used to so it is well worth viewing for a couple of hours.

    There has been much discussion over the years as to whether this film or Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING (1963) qualify as Hollywood's greatest ghost movie. I have to vote for THE HAUNTING. Yes, THE INNOCENTS is a stylistic masterpiece, but somehow, every time I watch it, THE INNOCENTS seems to me a series of macabre vignettes brilliantly realized. But the narrative of THE HAUNTING seems to hold together better. Jack Clayton's direction and Freddie Francis' camera-work for THE INNOCENTS are indeed stunning,and the kids are great. Yet I'm never compelled by the actual ectoplasmic motives and find myself irritated by Deborah Kerr's overly actress-y, stagey performance. But, hey, it's an impressive film nonetheless.

    I love this movie! Every now and then, you'll hear about a horror movie that is generally regarded by everyone to be a masterpiece. This is one of them. If there are critics of this movie, then they are few and far between. This is a movie that EVERY fan of horror needs to see. I don't think I'll ever be able to do it justice, but that's not gonna stop me from trying. Miss Giddens is a beautiful women, and is offered a job as Governess for a wealthy family with two children out in the country side. She soon starts to suspect that something is not quite right, and that the house and possible even the children may be haunted. I'll say no more, the less you know about this movie, the better! So, here's why I adore this movie. It's timeless! Even today, certain scenes are bound to make your skin crawl and keep you up at night. The subtly is brilliant in really unnerving the viewers that it makes it so memorable! Just mentioning this movie is bound to have people humming that or so famous tune! Even in the opening, hearing this haunting theme play before even seeing the opening credits or the production logo! Absolutely haunting! The ambiguity! This often fails in movies, but here, they got it just right. There are so many different interpretations to this movie, you could discuss it for hours! In fact, you probably will. The acting is exceptional! The two child actors were sensational, I cannot praise them enough. Deborah Kerr, as Miss Giddens was amazing too. A really emotional performance, and one you're not likely to forget. All of this helps to create an atmosphere that is chilling to the bone! The symbolism. This movie is full of it. I've watched this movie two times now, and even on the second time, did I pick up so many things that I missed the first. Some of this symbolism adds to certain interpretations. But it mainly adds to the creepy atmosphere that is The Innocents. Finally, the ending! My God what an ending! For a fair review, one should examine the faults of a movie, but there just isn't any. To me, this film is horror perfection! I could go on and on about it. It really is such a creepy and memorable film and one that I can not recommend highly enough! If you have not seen this movie, please check it out, I promise you will not be disappointed.

    One word to describe this film: boring. Seeing that this movie is considered "one of the best classic ghost stories of all times", I decided to see it. A bit disappointed, actually. Don't think it deserves all the praise. I'm not fond of black and white movies in general, and this was no different. Is it a joke that this is classed as "horror"? There wasn't ONE scary or suspenseful moment in the entire movie. Not one. It wouldn't even pass for a thriller. Maybe a drama... Is there such a genre as "ghost drama"? If not, it should be invented just for this movie. Maybe, back in the 60s, something like this was considered scary, but now it's just... boring. Yes, the acting was convincing, the story/characters were developed properly, and the script was well-written. But this was nowhere near enough to make the movie entertaining. It's watchable, but nothing spectacular. I was quite unimpressed with the ending also. Very poorly constructed, unimaginative, and not at all gratifying.

    In 1800s England Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr) is hired as a governess for two children--Flora (Pamela Franklin) and Miles (Martin Stephens)--in a huge house in the middle of nowhere. She starts to see ghosts and comes to believe that they're trying to possess the children. Are the ghosts real or is she going mad? Or are the kids playing games with her? The scariest thing about this is that the question is still unanswered at the end. There's evidence for each resolution. Any of the conclusions are disturbing. The acting is perfect. Kerr said this was her best performance and she's right. She plays it beautifully with just the tiniest touch of hysteria so you're never sure if what's she seeing is real. Stephens and Franklin match her--especially Stephens. That kid is downright creepy and the looks he gives her are disturbing. The ghosts are shown but sparingly. They're also downright terrifying. The first appearance of Quint(Peter Wyngarde) is enough to give you nightmares! You see his face slowly appear out of the darkness staring at Kerr. No blaring music or any sound at all. Just dead quiet making it even more scary. It's shot in beautiful black and white and CinemaScope which helps. You have to see this in wide screen or letter-boxed. Also there's a literate script and great direction. A powerful movie and one of the scariest ghost stories ever put on film.

    I loved how this movie tries to creepy out even before the movie as started as the start of the movie, you get the Really Creepy Kids voice. That is one hell of the way to the start a movie like this, I creepy factor dose not stop there at all. As the movie keeps going you may thing that Kids how doing something as do act a little strange in some scenes. I love this very dark settling movie, there are some very creepy scenes in this movie, the laughing near end of the movie was very creepy. I loved the ending of this movie, I clad that is one reason this might never see a remake, I can't see that do that ending now-er days The acting was outstanding from the whole cast 10 out of 10

    beautiful. precise. seductive. powerful. profound. an adaptation but with a special flavor. because it is a Gothic story and more. because Deborah Kerr does a splendid role and atmosphere - creepy, mysterious, dark, credible - is an admirable work. it is a slice from a period with precise manner to create tension. to make details as a delicate pieces of embroidery.and the acting - subtle, precious, sparkles of nuances - is touching and real impressive.a film like a memorable experience. the art of director, the amazing young actors, the house, the presence of Megs Jenkins, the ghosts and, sure, the music, the obsessive music are ingredients of this movie. must see it ! only for discover a style to present a story. and, for the warm air of past.

    The entire movie, you are never sure if the children are truly haunted, or if the nanny is haunted. She could be insane. The children could be just messing about with her, trying to scare her, sadly not knowing she's insane. The movie is really through her eyes, and if you think "she's insane" the movie suddenly becomes so much more horrible than a ghost story. One pictures her being sent off for murder, to a horrible Victorian insane asylum after the movie ends. If nothing else, you see she's changed, and ghosts or not, she's not normal anymore. Some adaptations of this story try to leave out the ghosts. You don't see them so you are left with more of a question about the sanity of the nanny. This movie adaptation is quite good as you get all the input the nanny does. It just slowly begins to dawn upon you, especially with the climatic end, that she could be insane. If she's insane, it's far more ghastly than ghosts, and you feel sorry for the children. It's a movie adaptation that tries to fool you, it plays on your emotions, but a skeptic can especially enjoy this movie. Real ghosts aren't nearly the danger that people that believe in ghosts can be. A rewatching, with the nanny as the "bad guy" scares people far more than when they first watched it thinking it a simply ghost story. The Innocents are the children, ghosts or nanny, they are simply playthings for adults in this movie.

    One of the original haunted house and its haunted history movies, Innocents, does an interesting difference to the later haunted house adoptions. Although the plot has become nearby a clich&eacute; in the later horror movies and it is not too hard to guess how the events turn out, the movie still feels refreshing. One of the main reasons for that is the clever use of the camera and not to rely on silly shock effects like in today's horror movies. Also Deborah Kerr was a joy to watch and when she gets in the middle of the things, I actually felt sorry for her. That is something that doesn't happen with today's silly horror movie babysitters. Innocents is from the beginning to the end an interesting, clever and amusing movie to watch.

    The story is something to ponder about. Although, none of the sequences boggle, frighten or at least put the wind up. Nothing. The bungalow is supposed to be haunted, but the ghosts in here seem to be in love. Well, their affection certainly won't cause anything. The setup is made to be suspense-filled, but nothing yields out of it. You anticipate a gruesome climax like a crescendo in a symphony, but you are let down, terribly. The casting is very good, with the lead children generating enough mystique to keep you on tenterhooks. But that's all. They, in fact, annoy you over time. Deborah Kerr is very expressional. The artist who played chaperon impresses. But, the writers are to be blamed for this botched attempt in horror genre. With the climax on board, the whole structure is daft. The dialogs spun out ridicule, the sequences result in scorn. Oh, exasperation is the only thing you garner. 3.4/10. BOTTOM LINE: Not even passes the litmus test for a genre so loved by people. Not recommended! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Profanity/Nudity/Foreplay: No | Vulgarity: Very Mild | Sex: Implied | Violence/Gore: No | Smoking/Alcohol/Drugs: No

    I wish to write this review as I do not believe many of the reviews for this film have been written by a skeptic. My viewpoint will be a little different than the usual review's take on matters due to that reason. I hope this review is interesting to the reader, but the reader must realize my different viewpoint. Despite the movies and plethora of TV shows treating the existence of ghosts as a "given" there actually is no conclusive evidence for such things. The various TV shows that depict ghost hunting are bemusing, at most; most probably delusional, as they will show people equipped with thermometers, emf meters, infrared cameras, and other such specialized equipment looking for ghosts yet one wonders just how can one prepare oneself to look for something if that something has never even been proved to exist in the first place? And, there is no surprise, at least to me, when they never find anything conclusive. Yet, the belief in ghosts must have some foundation. Somebody, somewhere, must have experienced or seen something that is "ghostlike". And, this movie deals with that position. Here, a live in "babysitter" (modern term for Deborah Kerr's role) experiences some things that are not easily explainable. Yet, nobody else seems to experience what she is experiencing. Or, do they but don't tell her? She has two young children to look after in a beautiful but rather empty Victorian mansion. The children are brother and sister and provide a sort of emotional mirror to a grown man and adult woman who had died fairly recently in this place and whom the children knew. The babysitter has an older woman to help her and this woman tells of the love of the now dead lovers. But, are the dead lovers gone or still there. The babysitter sees these "ghosts" in a frightening manner that seems to indicate no doubt of their existence...but nobody else does!! Not told in this story but implied is the fact that this babysitter ("governess" as they called them back then) is unmarried and around 40. Certainly she has some emotional issues over that! Though Deborah Kerr said this her finest role, her physical beauty was such that nobody could imagine her character was unmarried for lack of attention from men. In the original story the governess was probably more of a frustrated "plain Jane" who had issues with that fact and probably projected herself into the story of the dead lovers for that reason. So, is the governess imagining the ghosts or are there actually remnants of people now dead still lurking in that area? While watching the movie and trying to answer that question be prepared for some frightening events and sheer emotional terror. No great special effects like you see in modern films; just suspense and terror. They don't make these sort of films now like they used to so it is well worth viewing for a couple of hours.

    There has been much discussion over the years as to whether this film or Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING (1963) qualify as Hollywood's greatest ghost movie. I have to vote for THE HAUNTING. Yes, THE INNOCENTS is a stylistic masterpiece, but somehow, every time I watch it, THE INNOCENTS seems to me a series of macabre vignettes brilliantly realized. But the narrative of THE HAUNTING seems to hold together better. Jack Clayton's direction and Freddie Francis' camera-work for THE INNOCENTS are indeed stunning,and the kids are great. Yet I'm never compelled by the actual ectoplasmic motives and find myself irritated by Deborah Kerr's overly actress-y, stagey performance. But, hey, it's an impressive film nonetheless.

    I love this movie! Every now and then, you'll hear about a horror movie that is generally regarded by everyone to be a masterpiece. This is one of them. If there are critics of this movie, then they are few and far between. This is a movie that EVERY fan of horror needs to see. I don't think I'll ever be able to do it justice, but that's not gonna stop me from trying. Miss Giddens is a beautiful women, and is offered a job as Governess for a wealthy family with two children out in the country side. She soon starts to suspect that something is not quite right, and that the house and possible even the children may be haunted. I'll say no more, the less you know about this movie, the better! So, here's why I adore this movie. It's timeless! Even today, certain scenes are bound to make your skin crawl and keep you up at night. The subtly is brilliant in really unnerving the viewers that it makes it so memorable! Just mentioning this movie is bound to have people humming that or so famous tune! Even in the opening, hearing this haunting theme play before even seeing the opening credits or the production logo! Absolutely haunting! The ambiguity! This often fails in movies, but here, they got it just right. There are so many different interpretations to this movie, you could discuss it for hours! In fact, you probably will. The acting is exceptional! The two child actors were sensational, I cannot praise them enough. Deborah Kerr, as Miss Giddens was amazing too. A really emotional performance, and one you're not likely to forget. All of this helps to create an atmosphere that is chilling to the bone! The symbolism. This movie is full of it. I've watched this movie two times now, and even on the second time, did I pick up so many things that I missed the first. Some of this symbolism adds to certain interpretations. But it mainly adds to the creepy atmosphere that is The Innocents. Finally, the ending! My God what an ending! For a fair review, one should examine the faults of a movie, but there just isn't any. To me, this film is horror perfection! I could go on and on about it. It really is such a creepy and memorable film and one that I can not recommend highly enough! If you have not seen this movie, please check it out, I promise you will not be disappointed.

    One word to describe this film: boring. Seeing that this movie is considered "one of the best classic ghost stories of all times", I decided to see it. A bit disappointed, actually. Don't think it deserves all the praise. I'm not fond of black and white movies in general, and this was no different. Is it a joke that this is classed as "horror"? There wasn't ONE scary or suspenseful moment in the entire movie. Not one. It wouldn't even pass for a thriller. Maybe a drama... Is there such a genre as "ghost drama"? If not, it should be invented just for this movie. Maybe, back in the 60s, something like this was considered scary, but now it's just... boring. Yes, the acting was convincing, the story/characters were developed properly, and the script was well-written. But this was nowhere near enough to make the movie entertaining. It's watchable, but nothing spectacular. I was quite unimpressed with the ending also. Very poorly constructed, unimaginative, and not at all gratifying.

    In 1800s England Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr) is hired as a governess for two children--Flora (Pamela Franklin) and Miles (Martin Stephens)--in a huge house in the middle of nowhere. She starts to see ghosts and comes to believe that they're trying to possess the children. Are the ghosts real or is she going mad? Or are the kids playing games with her? The scariest thing about this is that the question is still unanswered at the end. There's evidence for each resolution. Any of the conclusions are disturbing. The acting is perfect. Kerr said this was her best performance and she's right. She plays it beautifully with just the tiniest touch of hysteria so you're never sure if what's she seeing is real. Stephens and Franklin match her--especially Stephens. That kid is downright creepy and the looks he gives her are disturbing. The ghosts are shown but sparingly. They're also downright terrifying. The first appearance of Quint(Peter Wyngarde) is enough to give you nightmares! You see his face slowly appear out of the darkness staring at Kerr. No blaring music or any sound at all. Just dead quiet making it even more scary. It's shot in beautiful black and white and CinemaScope which helps. You have to see this in wide screen or letter-boxed. Also there's a literate script and great direction. A powerful movie and one of the scariest ghost stories ever put on film.

    I loved how this movie tries to creepy out even before the movie as started as the start of the movie, you get the Really Creepy Kids voice. That is one hell of the way to the start a movie like this, I creepy factor dose not stop there at all. As the movie keeps going you may thing that Kids how doing something as do act a little strange in some scenes. I love this very dark settling movie, there are some very creepy scenes in this movie, the laughing near end of the movie was very creepy. I loved the ending of this movie, I clad that is one reason this might never see a remake, I can't see that do that ending now-er days The acting was outstanding from the whole cast 10 out of 10

    beautiful. precise. seductive. powerful. profound. an adaptation but with a special flavor. because it is a Gothic story and more. because Deborah Kerr does a splendid role and atmosphere - creepy, mysterious, dark, credible - is an admirable work. it is a slice from a period with precise manner to create tension. to make details as a delicate pieces of embroidery.and the acting - subtle, precious, sparkles of nuances - is touching and real impressive.a film like a memorable experience. the art of director, the amazing young actors, the house, the presence of Megs Jenkins, the ghosts and, sure, the music, the obsessive music are ingredients of this movie. must see it ! only for discover a style to present a story. and, for the warm air of past.

    The entire movie, you are never sure if the children are truly haunted, or if the nanny is haunted. She could be insane. The children could be just messing about with her, trying to scare her, sadly not knowing she's insane. The movie is really through her eyes, and if you think "she's insane" the movie suddenly becomes so much more horrible than a ghost story. One pictures her being sent off for murder, to a horrible Victorian insane asylum after the movie ends. If nothing else, you see she's changed, and ghosts or not, she's not normal anymore. Some adaptations of this story try to leave out the ghosts. You don't see them so you are left with more of a question about the sanity of the nanny. This movie adaptation is quite good as you get all the input the nanny does. It just slowly begins to dawn upon you, especially with the climatic end, that she could be insane. If she's insane, it's far more ghastly than ghosts, and you feel sorry for the children. It's a movie adaptation that tries to fool you, it plays on your emotions, but a skeptic can especially enjoy this movie. Real ghosts aren't nearly the danger that people that believe in ghosts can be. A rewatching, with the nanny as the "bad guy" scares people far more than when they first watched it thinking it a simply ghost story. The Innocents are the children, ghosts or nanny, they are simply playthings for adults in this movie.

    One of the original haunted house and its haunted history movies, Innocents, does an interesting difference to the later haunted house adoptions. Although the plot has become nearby a clich&eacute; in the later horror movies and it is not too hard to guess how the events turn out, the movie still feels refreshing. One of the main reasons for that is the clever use of the camera and not to rely on silly shock effects like in today's horror movies. Also Deborah Kerr was a joy to watch and when she gets in the middle of the things, I actually felt sorry for her. That is something that doesn't happen with today's silly horror movie babysitters. Innocents is from the beginning to the end an interesting, clever and amusing movie to watch.

    The story is something to ponder about. Although, none of the sequences boggle, frighten or at least put the wind up. Nothing. The bungalow is supposed to be haunted, but the ghosts in here seem to be in love. Well, their affection certainly won't cause anything. The setup is made to be suspense-filled, but nothing yields out of it. You anticipate a gruesome climax like a crescendo in a symphony, but you are let down, terribly. The casting is very good, with the lead children generating enough mystique to keep you on tenterhooks. But that's all. They, in fact, annoy you over time. Deborah Kerr is very expressional. The artist who played chaperon impresses. But, the writers are to be blamed for this botched attempt in horror genre. With the climax on board, the whole structure is daft. The dialogs spun out ridicule, the sequences result in scorn. Oh, exasperation is the only thing you garner. 3.4/10. BOTTOM LINE: Not even passes the litmus test for a genre so loved by people. Not recommended! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Profanity/Nudity/Foreplay: No | Vulgarity: Very Mild | Sex: Implied | Violence/Gore: No | Smoking/Alcohol/Drugs: No

    I wish to write this review as I do not believe many of the reviews for this film have been written by a skeptic. My viewpoint will be a little different than the usual review's take on matters due to that reason. I hope this review is interesting to the reader, but the reader must realize my different viewpoint. Despite the movies and plethora of TV shows treating the existence of ghosts as a "given" there actually is no conclusive evidence for such things. The various TV shows that depict ghost hunting are bemusing, at most; most probably delusional, as they will show people equipped with thermometers, emf meters, infrared cameras, and other such specialized equipment looking for ghosts yet one wonders just how can one prepare oneself to look for something if that something has never even been proved to exist in the first place? And, there is no surprise, at least to me, when they never find anything conclusive. Yet, the belief in ghosts must have some foundation. Somebody, somewhere, must have experienced or seen something that is "ghostlike". And, this movie deals with that position. Here, a live in "babysitter" (modern term for Deborah Kerr's role) experiences some things that are not easily explainable. Yet, nobody else seems to experience what she is experiencing. Or, do they but don't tell her? She has two young children to look after in a beautiful but rather empty Victorian mansion. The children are brother and sister and provide a sort of emotional mirror to a grown man and adult woman who had died fairly recently in this place and whom the children knew. The babysitter has an older woman to help her and this woman tells of the love of the now dead lovers. But, are the dead lovers gone or still there. The babysitter sees these "ghosts" in a frightening manner that seems to indicate no doubt of their existence...but nobody else does!! Not told in this story but implied is the fact that this babysitter ("governess" as they called them back then) is unmarried and around 40. Certainly she has some emotional issues over that! Though Deborah Kerr said this her finest role, her physical beauty was such that nobody could imagine her character was unmarried for lack of attention from men. In the original story the governess was probably more of a frustrated "plain Jane" who had issues with that fact and probably projected herself into the story of the dead lovers for that reason. So, is the governess imagining the ghosts or are there actually remnants of people now dead still lurking in that area? While watching the movie and trying to answer that question be prepared for some frightening events and sheer emotional terror. No great special effects like you see in modern films; just suspense and terror. They don't make these sort of films now like they used to so it is well worth viewing for a couple of hours.

    There has been much discussion over the years as to whether this film or Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING (1963) qualify as Hollywood's greatest ghost movie. I have to vote for THE HAUNTING. Yes, THE INNOCENTS is a stylistic masterpiece, but somehow, every time I watch it, THE INNOCENTS seems to me a series of macabre vignettes brilliantly realized. But the narrative of THE HAUNTING seems to hold together better. Jack Clayton's direction and Freddie Francis' camera-work for THE INNOCENTS are indeed stunning,and the kids are great. Yet I'm never compelled by the actual ectoplasmic motives and find myself irritated by Deborah Kerr's overly actress-y, stagey performance. But, hey, it's an impressive film nonetheless.

    I love this movie! Every now and then, you'll hear about a horror movie that is generally regarded by everyone to be a masterpiece. This is one of them. If there are critics of this movie, then they are few and far between. This is a movie that EVERY fan of horror needs to see. I don't think I'll ever be able to do it justice, but that's not gonna stop me from trying. Miss Giddens is a beautiful women, and is offered a job as Governess for a wealthy family with two children out in the country side. She soon starts to suspect that something is not quite right, and that the house and possible even the children may be haunted. I'll say no more, the less you know about this movie, the better! So, here's why I adore this movie. It's timeless! Even today, certain scenes are bound to make your skin crawl and keep you up at night. The subtly is brilliant in really unnerving the viewers that it makes it so memorable! Just mentioning this movie is bound to have people humming that or so famous tune! Even in the opening, hearing this haunting theme play before even seeing the opening credits or the production logo! Absolutely haunting! The ambiguity! This often fails in movies, but here, they got it just right. There are so many different interpretations to this movie, you could discuss it for hours! In fact, you probably will. The acting is exceptional! The two child actors were sensational, I cannot praise them enough. Deborah Kerr, as Miss Giddens was amazing too. A really emotional performance, and one you're not likely to forget. All of this helps to create an atmosphere that is chilling to the bone! The symbolism. This movie is full of it. I've watched this movie two times now, and even on the second time, did I pick up so many things that I missed the first. Some of this symbolism adds to certain interpretations. But it mainly adds to the creepy atmosphere that is The Innocents. Finally, the ending! My God what an ending! For a fair review, one should examine the faults of a movie, but there just isn't any. To me, this film is horror perfection! I could go on and on about it. It really is such a creepy and memorable film and one that I can not recommend highly enough! If you have not seen this movie, please check it out, I promise you will not be disappointed.

    One word to describe this film: boring. Seeing that this movie is considered "one of the best classic ghost stories of all times", I decided to see it. A bit disappointed, actually. Don't think it deserves all the praise. I'm not fond of black and white movies in general, and this was no different. Is it a joke that this is classed as "horror"? There wasn't ONE scary or suspenseful moment in the entire movie. Not one. It wouldn't even pass for a thriller. Maybe a drama... Is there such a genre as "ghost drama"? If not, it should be invented just for this movie. Maybe, back in the 60s, something like this was considered scary, but now it's just... boring. Yes, the acting was convincing, the story/characters were developed properly, and the script was well-written. But this was nowhere near enough to make the movie entertaining. It's watchable, but nothing spectacular. I was quite unimpressed with the ending also. Very poorly constructed, unimaginative, and not at all gratifying.

    In 1800s England Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr) is hired as a governess for two children--Flora (Pamela Franklin) and Miles (Martin Stephens)--in a huge house in the middle of nowhere. She starts to see ghosts and comes to believe that they're trying to possess the children. Are the ghosts real or is she going mad? Or are the kids playing games with her? The scariest thing about this is that the question is still unanswered at the end. There's evidence for each resolution. Any of the conclusions are disturbing. The acting is perfect. Kerr said this was her best performance and she's right. She plays it beautifully with just the tiniest touch of hysteria so you're never sure if what's she seeing is real. Stephens and Franklin match her--especially Stephens. That kid is downright creepy and the looks he gives her are disturbing. The ghosts are shown but sparingly. They're also downright terrifying. The first appearance of Quint(Peter Wyngarde) is enough to give you nightmares! You see his face slowly appear out of the darkness staring at Kerr. No blaring music or any sound at all. Just dead quiet making it even more scary. It's shot in beautiful black and white and CinemaScope which helps. You have to see this in wide screen or letter-boxed. Also there's a literate script and great direction. A powerful movie and one of the scariest ghost stories ever put on film.

    I loved how this movie tries to creepy out even before the movie as started as the start of the movie, you get the Really Creepy Kids voice. That is one hell of the way to the start a movie like this, I creepy factor dose not stop there at all. As the movie keeps going you may thing that Kids how doing something as do act a little strange in some scenes. I love this very dark settling movie, there are some very creepy scenes in this movie, the laughing near end of the movie was very creepy. I loved the ending of this movie, I clad that is one reason this might never see a remake, I can't see that do that ending now-er days The acting was outstanding from the whole cast 10 out of 10

    beautiful. precise. seductive. powerful. profound. an adaptation but with a special flavor. because it is a Gothic story and more. because Deborah Kerr does a splendid role and atmosphere - creepy, mysterious, dark, credible - is an admirable work. it is a slice from a period with precise manner to create tension. to make details as a delicate pieces of embroidery.and the acting - subtle, precious, sparkles of nuances - is touching and real impressive.a film like a memorable experience. the art of director, the amazing young actors, the house, the presence of Megs Jenkins, the ghosts and, sure, the music, the obsessive music are ingredients of this movie. must see it ! only for discover a style to present a story. and, for the warm air of past.
