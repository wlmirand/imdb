 <sinopse>
  After local youth Abdel is beaten unconscious by police, a riot ensues on his estate during which a policeman loses his gun. The gun is found by Vinz who threatens he will kill a cop if Abdel dies.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The film follows three young men and their time spent in the French suburban "ghetto," over a span of twenty-four hours. Vinz, a Jew, Sa&iuml;d, an Arab, and Hubert, a black boxer, have grown up in these French suburbs where high levels of diversity coupled with the racist and oppressive police force have raised tensions to a critical breaking point. During the riots that took place a night before, a police officer lost his handgun in the ensuing madness, only to leave it for Vinz to find. Now, with a newfound means to gain the respect he deserves, Vinz vows to kill a cop if his friend Abdel dies in the hospital, due the beating he received while in police custody.

    Quiet possibly one of my favorite ever foreign language films and surely the rebirth of the French film industry that captivated millions around the world for so long. That's why I call this film; the French new wave part 2... To those outside France, it's the French version of Boyz N The Hood, to those in it and to myself, it's a unrestrained urban thriller that moves at such a ferocious pace, you often find yourself on the edge of your seat, clingy on to your arm rest for dear life. Mathieu Kassovitz effectively uses black and white to create art out of the all the crime and violence, mastering a fine tight rope between the rawness of a poor, urban backdrop and a piece of art work that would not look a bit out of place, if it were hung in a gallery next to painting by Picasso. Uncompromising in his attempt to tell a story loosely based on actual events, about riots that lasted for more than 10 years in the French capital, Kassovitz want to portray a story in a manner that makes the whole world stop, not only to serve as mere voyeurs, but instead to actually think. La Haine tells the story of three vastly different and conflicting characters; a Jew, an Arab and an African. That seems to come effortlessly together like a barber shop quartet. As they have to deal with the aftermath of events that lead to a young Arab teenager being beaten into a coma on the outskirts of a riot - Adding fuel to the ever growing, racial and political tension between the people in charge and the powerless individuals of the projects. While most of us feel safe watching violence, as long as it's on TV or film, as we are for the most part detached from what we are experiencing, but instead the aim of for this film, throughout the entire duration of the film, about a world that takes place in the course of one day, which is the time span in the film that seems to last a eternity, we are engrossed in the action throughout, so we are not comfortable or assured at all, instead we are almost bullied into reacting and reciprocate a feeling of tension, as is endured in the film between the cops and the residents of the project. But ultimately the underlying theme of the film is a sense of hopelessness, that is nothing will ever change! It's just a cycle. This is best represented during the opening monologue, and in the final few scenes, as a story is told and narrated, consisting of a man who jumps of a 50 story building, but to reassure himself he keeps repeating "so far, So good, so far, So good" as he hurtles to his death. This is used to show that this never ending cycle of violence and hate is never going to stop, soon enough resulting in society's demises. But no one seems to care. As long as they are surviving, they don't care when it's falling, but when it crashes, that's when they panic. Magnificent, awesome, a compulsive viewing! This is a poignant yet humorous reminder of the harsh reality of people living in the ghettos of France. Boyz N The Hood was a great film, but it is almost eclipsed by this masterpiece and that's saying allot. A must watch. 'The world is ours'

    Just as relevant today as when it was made, La Haine (or Hate) captures the difficulties faced by disenfranchised youth in France. The news of rioting in France a couple of years ago made the film seem all too real. Looking back on the film, the film seems very prescient in foreshadowing the problems percolating beneath the surface in France. I imagine the economic slowdown since 2008 probably has made it even worse than what it was in the 90's. Powerful,gritty, and quite realistic portrait of contemporary France. The film is sort of a precursor to the rise of social realism in French films, with the Dardenne Brothers' works being the most successful example. The plot is a bit weak but the acting and the realism more than make up for it. Recommended for those who like social realism in films.

    La haine is an excellent movie a great proof that the old poetic oneiric movie-making is still alive. all the scenes in the movie are pure poetry transmitting this mysteriousness behind their symbols. Mathieu Kassovitz faces deep themes concerning human identity in contrast with a degrading society fuelled by hate. the title haine actually means hate, throughout the movie we witness hateful actions, hate against the different, hate that flows like blood in our streets and our souls. The movie means to show that our society is auto destructive, in fact it starts with a spoken quote "as a man is falling from a building he says to himself .so far so good, so far so good. the problem is not the fall, it's the impact to the ground:". The director uses this idea and puts it in a metaphors which is the story . The story takes place in Paris's projects during an ordinary day in the life of three friends Vinz, Hubert and Said each with a different personalty that react in their own way facing Society. the plot's growth represents a time bomb, time after time events worsten till we arrive to the end when the bomb explodes...BOOOM!! Another theme in the movie is the contrast between dream and reality. the main characters face events out of the ordinary (cow sighting) that are opposed by reality surrounding them, reality brings them back to earth and their illusory beliefs such as the vengeance of Vinz and Hubert's desire to escape. the events that follow each other contain a great unofficial magical realism influence, After a whole day and a night pass away composed by a dreamy and mysterious atmosphere; the morning comes and the harsh reality hits back making the bomb explode with the sure death of Vinz and the presumable of Hubert that it is obscured by the ending. Behind Grumwalski's story another theme is hidden which is relativism; every belief and faith an individual has is completely useless cause this life does not believe in you, and it is a complete absurdity without sense.

    "Reality", would be the simplest word for me to describe the main theme of this movie. Surely it depicts social, economical and racial factors but furthermore this is an analysis of human behaviour in its rawest form. Hate, anguish and sadness all correlate and it is my belief that these emotions have never been so clearly shown in a picture. I believe that any respectable, may it be American or European politician has to have seen this movie. It is filled with truths that are nothing but extremely valuable. It is relatable in so many ways; may it be because of the acting or simply because of the "heart aching" storyline. Contrary to preceding reviews I feel it is important to emphasize the way this film focuses on feelings of injustice, "HATE", and the power embedded in them. It is my belief that this movie is the most relevant of them all when it comes to portraying present realities and I challenge anyone to state the contrary. It is not only agonizing but revolting. I am myself of french, Swedish and algerian origins. Watch this movie and learn.

    I usually don't write reviews, but for this one I'll make exception because it caught my eye. Great film, as for the french cinema, so for the world. I guess I won't be able to say everything that's great about this film, but surely I will try. Mathieu Kassovitz is showing us one day in the life of three violent young men. One of them is Jewish (Vinz), one of them Arab (Sa&iuml;d), and the third one is black (Hubert). They live in a very violent hood full of riots. They're strongly involved in the conflict with the police. They don't have any other interests, except to become a wannabe street heroes, although Hubert does some boxing at the gym that has been burnt somewhere in the beginning of the movie. La haine starts with the scene of riots on the streets of France. I'm not informed when and why these things were happening, but it doesn't matter, cause they can happen every moment, in every corner of the world. In fact, these things are happening at this exact moment in which I'm writing. Opening scene is perfectly followed by Bob Marley's "Burnin' and Lootin", a sweet reggae melody. You can see some irony here. Then, we learn, from the TV news, that some Arabian guy has been wounded by the hand of the police. We meet the characters and then the story flows like a water. Story itself contains several events happening in a chronological order at different times of day. It is very well composed so we can understand the characters and the problems they're dealing with. They are chasing their identities and personalities. They are trying to be something what they consider to be right. But they are slaves of the modern society, and the slaves of the occasions in which they are. They are immature, they don't think before they do, and worst of all, they are hiding the truth from themselves. This is a story about the hunt for identity, about youth that is lost in the chaos of modern society, so when they try to find themselves, they actually become part of that chaos. "Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!" They are falling, but they are lying to themselves on the way down, and when they touch the ground, it won't end happily. La haine (Hate) is simple, yet powerful name for movie. It fits perfectly with its main theme. Hate. Unreasonable hate. People who hate something or someone because their friends and idols do that, because it's popular, because they want to feel accepted by the group. It's not a problem in violence, it's a problem in its cause. Whole film is filled with the symbols. I noticed some of them, I read some of the messages, but I'm sure that there are many more that I will catch on the second watching. Episode with the old man in the toilet? Brilliant. Whole symbolic Grunwalski story about the pride and death and the way it was told. Tadek Lokcinski like a prophet here, totally steals the scene in a few minutes of his appearance. A strong moral behind the story, but the boys can't understand it yet. It will cost them, so they will learn it on the hard way. Paroles on the walls that we can see everywhere around the city. One of them "The World is yours" (Said corrected it to "The World is ours") is the main motto of these young men. They want to try everything, and they want it now, but they don't see the hole on the end of the road they went. This also may indicate Scarface, which contains similar messages. One more thing that I found interesting was the picture of the poet, Charles Baudelaire on the building at the end of the movie, and I am sure that this isn't randomly put there. Baudelaire wrote the poem called "Le Tonneau de la Haine" (The Cask of Hate) so there's an obvious connection. I like the fact that the characters have the same names as the actors that play them. Crime isn't glorified in this movie, neither is the law. Violence is strongly criticized, modern society isn't spared either. Nothing is exaggerated, this is pretty realistic picture of what's happening around and inside us. We can get to like the characters, but it would be wrong if we agreed with most of their deeds. Did we learn something from this movie? Well, we learned plenty of things. Paris, so as the world, isn't just a city of love, there are "black and gray" sides of it. It may be easy to tell, but not to do. Especially to pull the trigger and kill the face in front of you. Neither side of the conflict is absolutely right or absolutely wrong. Sometimes is better to swallow the pride. Batman is not so strong. Directing and camera work are great, acting too, dialogs are smooth and interesting even with the English subtitles, so I can only dream how much this is enjoyable for the French speaker. Soundtrack is one more great part of the film. I didn't write the flaws of the movie because when I watch some gem of the cinema like this one, I try to concentrate on the good parts of it, and as I said, La haine is full of them. And still, there are many things that I forgot to write, or missed while I was watching. 10/10 I suggest it to everyone, don't be repelled by the bunch of kids who try to identify with the characters in this movie.

    I know everyone liked this film, but probably none have been around Arrondissements like 18. This is not Mean Streets but a couple of lame dudes who would have been beaten with bats had they lived in Brooklyn or Bronx. The movie is a great example of why we need Arrondissements like 18, to keep these hooligans penned up. It does not even come close to Battle for Algiers in terms of cinema verite realism. There are much better French films than this pretentious attempt. Sure lighting and black/white photography was great, direction great, actors superb but there was no really original story or insight. The handling of the three main actors was really very, very well done: Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kounde, Said Taghmaui - talk about three amigos. But script seemed very flat... as they just bum around from one scene to the next being stupid with little or no insight. No real insight into their lives, families, other friends, environment. They are simply pugs with no original thoughts other than, "I got to get out of here". ! Brilliant. They sure knew how to navigate the art opening. Film Formula: take some skin heads, bad cops, some pugs, the projects as background: stir, walla ! a movie. But if no one has been near the real deal and only read about it..oh, my gosh honey...look at their conditions! "And such one dimensional characters. See what the projects create" No insight whatsoever except standard clich&eacute;s which to white people are 'oh so enlightening". Really. Do you talk about this 'insightful' movie at wine and cheese art openings. Somehow the film represents 24 hrs in their lives. It feels more like 72 hours. Go see Banksy instead. You will be well rewarded.

    ... the very moment he passed the gun to his friend. Ugly movie. Noisy, disgusting even. Also childish and innocent. At least 2 stories in it: 1. The smaller one - how mighty you could feel when carrying a gun. How inhuman you become just because of possessing it. But when it comes to the real killing - the fully conscious one - you feel you have choice. And you choose. 2. The bigger story is the suffocating realization of the scale of the terror. You receive a detailed picture of the quiet torture that represents the everyday life of a great part of the humans in "civilized Europe" (and America, and Asia, and Africa, and Australia). Just for the case they are gathered in Paris. This movie won't be seen by any of the people who live such kind of life. Pity. But any of the rest is obliged not to remain indifferent.

    20 Hours of self-destructive wandering on behalf of three kids living in the suburbs of Paris. The scenario is the aftermath of the previous night's violent riots, in which a friend of theirs, Abdel, was injured and is in the hospital, in a coma. One of the friends finds a gun, he declares that if Abdel dies, he will kill a cop. The tension never lingers on the surface, but it's always present. Stylishly directed by d&eacute;butante Mathieu Kassovitz, who also shows a great ability to lead his cast (a young and also d&eacute;butante Vincent Cassel stands out the most). The movie is a bitter reflection on hate (like the title rightfully implies), on its justification and its manifestation. A gray portrait of how anger causes an irrational sense of isolationism, how it pushes away any form of respectable human contact, creating a wall that doesn't protect, it only traps. Winner for Best Director at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.

    While to most outsiders Paris seems the very picture of beauty and civility, France has had a long and unfortunate history of intolerance toward outsiders, and this powerful drama from filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz takes an unblinking look at a racially diverse group of young people trapped in the Parisian economic and social underclass.La Haine is a French black-and-white drama/suspense film written, co-edited, and directed by Kassovitz and it features Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kound&eacute;, Sa&iuml;d Taghmaoui, Abdel Ahmed Ghili and Solo. Vinz, who is Jewish, Hubert, who is Black, and Said, who is Arabic, are young men from the lower rungs of the French economic ladder; they have no jobs, few prospects, and no productive way to spend their time. They hang out and wander the streets as a way of filling their days and are sometimes caught up in frequent skirmishes between the police and other disaffected youth. One day, a street riot breaks out after police seriously injure an Arab student; the three friends are arrested and questioned, and it is learned that a policeman lost a gun in the chaos. However, what they don't know is that Vinz picked it up and has it in his possession, and when Vinz, Hubert, and Said get into a scuffle with a group of racist skinheads, the circumstances seem poised for tragedy. La Haine is a Generation X film, whatever that means, but more mature and insightful than the American Gen X movies.Kassovitz's iconic film about race, violence, and class struggle is both rousing entertainment and brilliant film making.And he mines so much tension and pointed dialogue from a low budget and deceptively simple premise that you wonder why so much of current Hollywood's own social realism ends up shooting $50 million blanks.A great film indeed.

    "La Haine" is mostly liked by the french kids and teenagers because of it's reality to show the violence in the outskirts in France, mostly in the suburb of Paris. The film is full of morals and it's also why many peoples love it, it's like a fable. I enjoyed the movie also for the musics : mostly rap but it's what i listened majority when i saw this film for the first time. Vincent Cassel also make a reference to Taxi Driver by saying "you're talking to me?" front of his mirror, many teenagers thinks this sentence is from "La Haine" by the way. This movie show the reality in the outskirts in France but you can also think it has been shot in any other country. The violence is everywhere.

La haine starts with the scene of riots on the streets of France. I'm not informed when and why these things were happening, but it doesn't matter, cause they can happen every moment, in every corner of the world. In fact, these things are happening at this exact moment in which I'm writing. Opening scene is perfectly followed by Bob Marley's "Burnin' and Lootin", a sweet reggae melody. You can see some irony here. Then, we learn, from the TV news, that some Arabian guy has been wounded by the hand of the police. We meet the characters and then the story flows like a water. Story itself contains several events happening in a chronological order at different times of day. It is very well composed so we can understand the characters and the problems they're dealing with. They are chasing their identities and personalities. They are trying to be something what they consider to be right. But they are slaves of the modern society, and the slaves of the occasions in which they are. They are immature, they don't think before they do, and worst of all, they are hiding the truth from themselves. This is a story about the hunt for identity, about youth that is lost in the chaos of modern society, so when they try to find themselves, they actually become part of that chaos. "Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!" They are falling, but they are lying to themselves on the way down, and when they touch the ground, it won't end happily. La haine (Hate) is simple, yet powerful name for movie. It fits perfectly with its main theme. Hate. Unreasonable hate. People who hate something or someone because their friends and idols do that, because it's popular, because they want to feel accepted by the group. It's not a problem in violence, it's a problem in its cause. Whole film is filled with the symbols. I noticed some of them, I read some of the messages, but I'm sure that there are many more that I will catch on the second watching. Episode with the old man in the toilet? Brilliant. Whole symbolic Grunwalski story about the pride and death and the way it was told. Tadek Lokcinski like a prophet here, totally steals the scene in a few minutes of his appearance. A strong moral behind the story, but the boys can't understand it yet. It will cost them, so they will learn it on the hard way. Paroles on the walls that we can see everywhere around the city. One of them "The World is yours" (Said corrected it to "The World is ours") is the main motto of these young men. They want to try everything, and they want it now, but they don't see the hole on the end of the road they went. This also may indicate Scarface, which contains similar messages. One more thing that I found interesting was the picture of the poet, Charles Baudelaire on the building at the end of the movie, and I am sure that this isn't randomly put there. Baudelaire wrote the poem called "Le Tonneau de la Haine" (The Cask of Hate) so there's an obvious connection. I like the fact that the characters have the same names as the actors that play them. Crime isn't glorified in this movie, neither is the law. Violence is strongly criticized, modern society isn't spared either. Nothing is exaggerated, this is pretty realistic picture of what's happening around and inside us. We can get to like the characters, but it would be wrong if we agreed with most of their deeds. Did we learn something from this movie? Well, we learned plenty of things. Paris, so as the world, isn't just a city of love, there are "black and gray" sides of it. It may be easy to tell, but not to do. Especially to pull the trigger and kill the face in front of you. Neither side of the conflict is absolutely right or absolutely wrong. Sometimes is better to swallow the pride. Batman is not so strong. Directing and camera work are great, acting too, dialogs are smooth and interesting even with the English subtitles, so I can only dream how much this is enjoyable for the French speaker. Soundtrack is one more great part of the film. I didn't write the flaws of the movie because when I watch some gem of the cinema like this one, I try to concentrate on the good parts of it, and as I said, La haine is full of them. And still, there are many things that I forgot to write, or missed while I was watching. 10/10 I suggest it to everyone, don't be repelled by the bunch of kids who try to identify with the characters in this movie.

    I know everyone liked this film, but probably none have been around Arrondissements like 18. This is not Mean Streets but a couple of lame dudes who would have been beaten with bats had they lived in Brooklyn or Bronx. The movie is a great example of why we need Arrondissements like 18, to keep these hooligans penned up. It does not even come close to Battle for Algiers in terms of cinema verite realism. There are much better French films than this pretentious attempt. Sure lighting and black/white photography was great, direction great, actors superb but there was no really original story or insight. The handling of the three main actors was really very, very well done: Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kounde, Said Taghmaui - talk about three amigos. But script seemed very flat... as they just bum around from one scene to the next being stupid with little or no insight. No real insight into their lives, families, other friends, environment. They are simply pugs with no original thoughts other than, "I got to get out of here". ! Brilliant. They sure knew how to navigate the art opening. Film Formula: take some skin heads, bad cops, some pugs, the projects as background: stir, walla ! a movie. But if no one has been near the real deal and only read about it..oh, my gosh honey...look at their conditions! "And such one dimensional characters. See what the projects create" No insight whatsoever except standard clich&eacute;s which to white people are 'oh so enlightening". Really. Do you talk about this 'insightful' movie at wine and cheese art openings. Somehow the film represents 24 hrs in their lives. It feels more like 72 hours. Go see Banksy instead. You will be well rewarded.

    ... the very moment he passed the gun to his friend. Ugly movie. Noisy, disgusting even. Also childish and innocent. At least 2 stories in it: 1. The smaller one - how mighty you could feel when carrying a gun. How inhuman you become just because of possessing it. But when it comes to the real killing - the fully conscious one - you feel you have choice. And you choose. 2. The bigger story is the suffocating realization of the scale of the terror. You receive a detailed picture of the quiet torture that represents the everyday life of a great part of the humans in "civilized Europe" (and America, and Asia, and Africa, and Australia). Just for the case they are gathered in Paris. This movie won't be seen by any of the people who live such kind of life. Pity. But any of the rest is obliged not to remain indifferent.

    20 Hours of self-destructive wandering on behalf of three kids living in the suburbs of Paris. The scenario is the aftermath of the previous night's violent riots, in which a friend of theirs, Abdel, was injured and is in the hospital, in a coma. One of the friends finds a gun, he declares that if Abdel dies, he will kill a cop. The tension never lingers on the surface, but it's always present. Stylishly directed by d&eacute;butante Mathieu Kassovitz, who also shows a great ability to lead his cast (a young and also d&eacute;butante Vincent Cassel stands out the most). The movie is a bitter reflection on hate (like the title rightfully implies), on its justification and its manifestation. A gray portrait of how anger causes an irrational sense of isolationism, how it pushes away any form of respectable human contact, creating a wall that doesn't protect, it only traps. Winner for Best Director at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.

    While to most outsiders Paris seems the very picture of beauty and civility, France has had a long and unfortunate history of intolerance toward outsiders, and this powerful drama from filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz takes an unblinking look at a racially diverse group of young people trapped in the Parisian economic and social underclass.La Haine is a French black-and-white drama/suspense film written, co-edited, and directed by Kassovitz and it features Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kound&eacute;, Sa&iuml;d Taghmaoui, Abdel Ahmed Ghili and Solo. Vinz, who is Jewish, Hubert, who is Black, and Said, who is Arabic, are young men from the lower rungs of the French economic ladder; they have no jobs, few prospects, and no productive way to spend their time. They hang out and wander the streets as a way of filling their days and are sometimes caught up in frequent skirmishes between the police and other disaffected youth. One day, a street riot breaks out after police seriously injure an Arab student; the three friends are arrested and questioned, and it is learned that a policeman lost a gun in the chaos. However, what they don't know is that Vinz picked it up and has it in his possession, and when Vinz, Hubert, and Said get into a scuffle with a group of racist skinheads, the circumstances seem poised for tragedy. La Haine is a Generation X film, whatever that means, but more mature and insightful than the American Gen X movies.Kassovitz's iconic film about race, violence, and class struggle is both rousing entertainment and brilliant film making.And he mines so much tension and pointed dialogue from a low budget and deceptively simple premise that you wonder why so much of current Hollywood's own social realism ends up shooting $50 million blanks.A great film indeed.

    "La Haine" is mostly liked by the french kids and teenagers because of it's reality to show the violence in the outskirts in France, mostly in the suburb of Paris. The film is full of morals and it's also why many peoples love it, it's like a fable. I enjoyed the movie also for the musics : mostly rap but it's what i listened majority when i saw this film for the first time. Vincent Cassel also make a reference to Taxi Driver by saying "you're talking to me?" front of his mirror, many teenagers thinks this sentence is from "La Haine" by the way. This movie show the reality in the outskirts in France but you can also think it has been shot in any other country. The violence is everywhere.

    Quiet possibly one of my favorite ever foreign language films and surely the rebirth of the French film industry that captivated millions around the world for so long. That's why I call this film; the French new wave part 2... To those outside France, it's the French version of Boyz N The Hood, to those in it and to myself, it's a unrestrained urban thriller that moves at such a ferocious pace, you often find yourself on the edge of your seat, clingy on to your arm rest for dear life. Mathieu Kassovitz effectively uses black and white to create art out of the all the crime and violence, mastering a fine tight rope between the rawness of a poor, urban backdrop and a piece of art work that would not look a bit out of place, if it were hung in a gallery next to painting by Picasso. Uncompromising in his attempt to tell a story loosely based on actual events, about riots that lasted for more than 10 years in the French capital, Kassovitz want to portray a story in a manner that makes the whole world stop, not only to serve as mere voyeurs, but instead to actually think. La Haine tells the story of three vastly different and conflicting characters; a Jew, an Arab and an African. That seems to come effortlessly together like a barber shop quartet. As they have to deal with the aftermath of events that lead to a young Arab teenager being beaten into a coma on the outskirts of a riot - Adding fuel to the ever growing, racial and political tension between the people in charge and the powerless individuals of the projects. While most of us feel safe watching violence, as long as it's on TV or film, as we are for the most part detached from what we are experiencing, but instead the aim of for this film, throughout the entire duration of the film, about a world that takes place in the course of one day, which is the time span in the film that seems to last a eternity, we are engrossed in the action throughout, so we are not comfortable or assured at all, instead we are almost bullied into reacting and reciprocate a feeling of tension, as is endured in the film between the cops and the residents of the project. But ultimately the underlying theme of the film is a sense of hopelessness, that is nothing will ever change! It's just a cycle. This is best represented during the opening monologue, and in the final few scenes, as a story is told and narrated, consisting of a man who jumps of a 50 story building, but to reassure himself he keeps repeating "so far, So good, so far, So good" as he hurtles to his death. This is used to show that this never ending cycle of violence and hate is never going to stop, soon enough resulting in society's demises. But no one seems to care. As long as they are surviving, they don't care when it's falling, but when it crashes, that's when they panic. Magnificent, awesome, a compulsive viewing! This is a poignant yet humorous reminder of the harsh reality of people living in the ghettos of France. Boyz N The Hood was a great film, but it is almost eclipsed by this masterpiece and that's saying allot. A must watch. 'The world is ours'

    Just as relevant today as when it was made, La Haine (or Hate) captures the difficulties faced by disenfranchised youth in France. The news of rioting in France a couple of years ago made the film seem all too real. Looking back on the film, the film seems very prescient in foreshadowing the problems percolating beneath the surface in France. I imagine the economic slowdown since 2008 probably has made it even worse than what it was in the 90's. Powerful,gritty, and quite realistic portrait of contemporary France. The film is sort of a precursor to the rise of social realism in French films, with the Dardenne Brothers' works being the most successful example. The plot is a bit weak but the acting and the realism more than make up for it. Recommended for those who like social realism in films.

    La haine is an excellent movie a great proof that the old poetic oneiric movie-making is still alive. all the scenes in the movie are pure poetry transmitting this mysteriousness behind their symbols. Mathieu Kassovitz faces deep themes concerning human identity in contrast with a degrading society fuelled by hate. the title haine actually means hate, throughout the movie we witness hateful actions, hate against the different, hate that flows like blood in our streets and our souls. The movie means to show that our society is auto destructive, in fact it starts with a spoken quote "as a man is falling from a building he says to himself .so far so good, so far so good. the problem is not the fall, it's the impact to the ground:". The director uses this idea and puts it in a metaphors which is the story . The story takes place in Paris's projects during an ordinary day in the life of three friends Vinz, Hubert and Said each with a different personalty that react in their own way facing Society. the plot's growth represents a time bomb, time after time events worsten till we arrive to the end when the bomb explodes...BOOOM!! Another theme in the movie is the contrast between dream and reality. the main characters face events out of the ordinary (cow sighting) that are opposed by reality surrounding them, reality brings them back to earth and their illusory beliefs such as the vengeance of Vinz and Hubert's desire to escape. the events that follow each other contain a great unofficial magical realism influence, After a whole day and a night pass away composed by a dreamy and mysterious atmosphere; the morning comes and the harsh reality hits back making the bomb explode with the sure death of Vinz and the presumable of Hubert that it is obscured by the ending. Behind Grumwalski's story another theme is hidden which is relativism; every belief and faith an individual has is completely useless cause this life does not believe in you, and it is a complete absurdity without sense. GOODBYE SOUL BROTHERS

    "Reality", would be the simplest word for me to describe the main theme of this movie. Surely it depicts social, economical and racial factors but furthermore this is an analysis of human behaviour in its rawest form. Hate, anguish and sadness all correlate and it is my belief that these emotions have never been so clearly shown in a picture. I believe that any respectable, may it be American or European politician has to have seen this movie. It is filled with truths that are nothing but extremely valuable. It is relatable in so many ways; may it be because of the acting or simply because of the "heart aching" storyline. Contrary to preceding reviews I feel it is important to emphasize the way this film focuses on feelings of injustice, "HATE", and the power embedded in them. It is my belief that this movie is the most relevant of them all when it comes to portraying present realities and I challenge anyone to state the contrary. It is not only agonizing but revolting. I am myself of french, Swedish and algerian origins. Watch this movie and learn.

    I usually don't write reviews, but for this one I'll make exception because it caught my eye. Great film, as for the french cinema, so for the world. I guess I won't be able to say everything that's great about this film, but surely I will try. Mathieu Kassovitz is showing us one day in the life of three violent young men. One of them is Jewish (Vinz), one of them Arab (Sa&iuml;d), and the third one is black (Hubert). They live in a very violent hood full of riots. They're strongly involved in the conflict with the police. They don't have any other interests, except to become a wannabe street heroes, although Hubert does some boxing at the gym that has been burnt somewhere in the beginning of the movie. La haine starts with the scene of riots on the streets of France. I'm not informed when and why these things were happening, but it doesn't matter, cause they can happen every moment, in every corner of the world. In fact, these things are happening at this exact moment in which I'm writing. Opening scene is perfectly followed by Bob Marley's "Burnin' and Lootin", a sweet reggae melody.

    "La Haine" is mostly liked by the french kids and teenagers because of it's reality to show the violence in the outskirts in France, mostly in the suburb of Paris. The film is full of morals and it's also why many peoples love it, it's like a fable. I enjoyed the movie also for the musics : mostly rap but it's what i listened majority when i saw this film for the first time. Vincent Cassel also make a reference to Taxi Driver by saying "you're talking to me?" front of his mirror, many teenagers thinks this sentence is from "La Haine" by the way. This movie show the reality in the outskirts in France but you can also think it has been shot in any other country. The violence is everywhere.

    Quiet possibly one of my favorite ever foreign language films and surely the rebirth of the French film industry that captivated millions around the world for so long. That's why I call this film; the French new wave part 2... To those outside France, it's the French version of Boyz N The Hood, to those in it and to myself, it's a unrestrained urban thriller that moves at such a ferocious pace, you often find yourself on the edge of your seat, clingy on to your arm rest for dear life. Mathieu Kassovitz effectively uses black and white to create art out of the all the crime and violence, mastering a fine tight rope between the rawness of a poor, urban backdrop and a piece of art work that would not look a bit out of place, if it were hung in a gallery next to painting by Picasso. Uncompromising in his attempt to tell a story loosely based on actual events, about riots that lasted for more than 10 years in the French capital, Kassovitz want to portray a story in a manner that makes the whole world stop, not only to serve as mere voyeurs, but instead to actually think. La Haine tells the story of three vastly different and conflicting characters; a Jew, an Arab and an African. That seems to come effortlessly together like a barber shop quartet. As they have to deal with the aftermath of events that lead to a young Arab teenager being beaten into a coma on the outskirts of a riot - Adding fuel to the ever growing, racial and political tension between the people in charge and the powerless individuals of the projects. While most of us feel safe watching violence, as long as it's on TV or film, as we are for the most part detached from what we are experiencing, but instead the aim of for this film, throughout the entire duration of the film, about a world that takes place in the course of one day, which is the time span in the film that seems to last a eternity, we are engrossed in the action throughout, so we are not comfortable or assured at all, instead we are almost bullied into reacting and reciprocate a feeling of tension, as is endured in the film between the cops and the residents of the project. But ultimately the underlying theme of the film is a sense of hopelessness, that is nothing will ever change! It's just a cycle. This is best represented during the opening monologue, and in the final few scenes, as a story is told and narrated, consisting of a man who jumps of a 50 story building, but to reassure himself he keeps repeating "so far, So good, so far, So good" as he hurtles to his death. This is used to show that this never ending cycle of violence and hate is never going to stop, soon enough resulting in society's demises. But no one seems to care. As long as they are surviving, they don't care when it's falling, but when it crashes, that's when they panic. Magnificent, awesome, a compulsive viewing! This is a poignant yet humorous reminder of the harsh reality of people living in the ghettos of France. Boyz N The Hood was a great film, but it is almost eclipsed by this masterpiece and that's saying allot. A must watch. 'The world is ours'

    Just as relevant today as when it was made, La Haine (or Hate) captures the difficulties faced by disenfranchised youth in France. The news of rioting in France a couple of years ago made the film seem all too real. Looking back on the film, the film seems very prescient in foreshadowing the problems percolating beneath the surface in France. I imagine the economic slowdown since 2008 probably has made it even worse than what it was in the 90's. Powerful,gritty, and quite realistic portrait of contemporary France. The film is sort of a precursor to the rise of social realism in French films, with the Dardenne Brothers' works being the most successful example. The plot is a bit weak but the acting and the realism more than make up for it. Recommended for those who like social realism in films.

    La haine is an excellent movie a great proof that the old poetic oneiric movie-making is still alive. all the scenes in the movie are pure poetry transmitting this mysteriousness behind their symbols. Mathieu Kassovitz faces deep themes concerning human identity in contrast with a degrading society fuelled by hate. the title haine actually means hate, throughout the movie we witness hateful actions, hate against the different, hate that flows like blood in our streets and our souls. The movie means to show that our society is auto destructive, in fact it starts with a spoken quote "as a man is falling from a building he says to himself .so far so good, so far so good. the problem is not the fall, it's the impact to the ground:". The director uses this idea and puts it in a metaphors which is the story . The story takes place in Paris's projects during an ordinary day in the life of three friends Vinz, Hubert and Said each with a different personalty that react in their own way facing Society. the plot's growth represents a time bomb, time after time events worsten till we arrive to the end when the bomb explodes...BOOOM!! Another theme in the movie is the contrast between dream and reality. the main characters face events out of the ordinary (cow sighting) that are opposed by reality surrounding them, reality brings them back to earth and their illusory beliefs such as the vengeance of Vinz and Hubert's desire to escape. the events that follow each other contain a great unofficial magical realism influence, After a whole day and a night pass away composed by a dreamy and mysterious atmosphere; the morning comes and the harsh reality hits back making the bomb explode with the sure death of Vinz and the presumable of Hubert that it is obscured by the ending. Behind Grumwalski's story another theme is hidden which is relativism; every belief and faith an individual has is completely useless cause this life does not believe in you, and it is a complete absurdity without sense.

    "Reality", would be the simplest word for me to describe the main theme of this movie. Surely it depicts social, economical and racial factors but furthermore this is an analysis of human behaviour in its rawest form. Hate, anguish and sadness all correlate and it is my belief that these emotions have never been so clearly shown in a picture. I believe that any respectable, may it be American or European politician has to have seen this movie. It is filled with truths that are nothing but extremely valuable. It is relatable in so many ways; may it be because of the acting or simply because of the "heart aching" storyline. Contrary to preceding reviews I feel it is important to emphasize the way this film focuses on feelings of injustice, "HATE", and the power embedded in them. It is my belief that this movie is the most relevant of them all when it comes to portraying present realities and I challenge anyone to state the contrary. It is not only agonizing but revolting. I am myself of french, Swedish and algerian origins. Watch this movie and learn.

    I usually don't write reviews, but for this one I'll make exception because it caught my eye. Great film, as for the french cinema, so for the world. I guess I won't be able to say everything that's great about this film, but surely I will try. Mathieu Kassovitz is showing us one day in the life of three violent young men. One of them is Jewish (Vinz), one of them Arab (Sa&iuml;d), and the third one is black (Hubert). They live in a very violent hood full of riots. They're strongly involved in the conflict with the police. They don't have any other interests, except to become a wannabe street heroes, although Hubert does some boxing at the gym that has been burnt somewhere in the beginning of the movie. La haine starts with the scene of riots on the streets of France. I'm not informed when and why these things were happening, but it doesn't matter, cause they can happen every moment, in every corner of the world. In fact, these things are happening at this exact moment in which I'm writing. Opening scene is perfectly followed by Bob Marley's "Burnin' and Lootin", a sweet reggae melody. You can see some irony here. Then, we learn, from the TV news, that some Arabian guy has been wounded by the hand of the police. We meet the characters and then the story flows like a water. Story itself contains several events happening in a chronological order at different times of day. It is very well composed so we can understand the characters and the problems they're dealing with. They are chasing their identities and personalities. They are trying to be something what they consider to be right. But they are slaves of the modern society, and the slaves of the occasions in which they are. They are immature, they don't think before they do, and worst of all, they are hiding the truth from themselves. This is a story about the hunt for identity, about youth that is lost in the chaos of modern society, so when they try to find themselves, they actually become part of that chaos. "Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!" They are falling, but they are lying to themselves on the way down, and when they touch the ground, it won't end happily. La haine (Hate) is simple, yet powerful name for movie. It fits perfectly with its main theme. Hate. Unreasonable hate. People who hate something or someone because their friends and idols do that, because it's popular, because they want to feel accepted by the group. It's not a problem in violence, it's a problem in its cause. Whole film is filled with the symbols. I noticed some of them, I read some of the messages, but I'm sure that there are many more that I will catch on the second watching. Episode with the old man in the toilet? Brilliant. Whole symbolic Grunwalski story about the pride and death and the way it was told. Tadek Lokcinski like a prophet here, totally steals the scene in a few minutes of his appearance. A strong moral behind the story, but the boys can't understand it yet. It will cost them, so they will learn it on the hard way. Paroles on the walls that we can see everywhere around the city. One of them "The World is yours" (Said corrected it to "The World is ours") is the main motto of these young men. They want to try everything, and they want it now, but they don't see the hole on the end of the road they went. This also may indicate Scarface, which contains similar messages. One more thing that I found interesting was the picture of the poet, Charles Baudelaire on the building at the end of the movie, and I am sure that this isn't randomly put there. Baudelaire wrote the poem called "Le Tonneau de la Haine" (The Cask of Hate) so there's an obvious connection. I like the fact that the characters have the same names as the actors that play them. Crime isn't glorified in this movie, neither is the law. Violence is strongly criticized, modern society isn't spared either. Nothing is exaggerated, this is pretty realistic picture of what's happening around and inside us. We can get to like the characters, but it would be wrong if we agreed with most of their deeds. Did we learn something from this movie? Well, we learned plenty of things. Paris, so as the world, isn't just a city of love, there are "black and gray" sides of it. It may be easy to tell, but not to do. Especially to pull the trigger and kill the face in front of you. Neither side of the conflict is absolutely right or absolutely wrong. Sometimes is better to swallow the pride. Batman is not so strong. Directing and camera work are great, acting too, dialogs are smooth and interesting even with the English subtitles, so I can only dream how much this is enjoyable for the French speaker. Soundtrack is one more great part of the film. I didn't write the flaws of the movie because when I watch some gem of the cinema like this one, I try to concentrate on the good parts of it, and as I said, La haine is full of them. And still, there are many things that I forgot to write, or missed while I was watching. 10/10 I suggest it to everyone, don't be repelled by the bunch of kids who try to identify with the characters in this movie.

    I know everyone liked this film, but probably none have been around Arrondissements like 18. This is not Mean Streets but a couple of lame dudes who would have been beaten with bats had they lived in Brooklyn or Bronx. The movie is a great example of why we need Arrondissements like 18, to keep these hooligans penned up. It does not even come close to Battle for Algiers in terms of cinema verite realism. There are much better French films than this pretentious attempt. Sure lighting and black/white photography was great, direction great, actors superb but there was no really original story or insight. The handling of the three main actors was really very, very well done: Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kounde, Said Taghmaui - talk about three amigos. But script seemed very flat... as they just bum around from one scene to the next being stupid with little or no insight. No real insight into their lives, families, other friends, environment. They are simply pugs with no original thoughts other than, "I got to get out of here". ! Brilliant. They sure knew how to navigate the art opening. Film Formula: take some skin heads, bad cops, some pugs, the projects as background: stir, walla ! a movie. But if no one has been near the real deal and only read about it..oh, my gosh honey...look at their conditions! "And such one dimensional characters. See what the projects create" No insight whatsoever except standard clich&eacute;s which to white people are 'oh so enlightening". Really. Do you talk about this 'insightful' movie at wine and cheese art openings. Somehow the film represents 24 hrs in their lives. It feels more like 72 hours. Go see Banksy instead. You will be well rewarded.

    ... the very moment he passed the gun to his friend. Ugly movie. Noisy, disgusting even. Also childish and innocent. At least 2 stories in it: 1. The smaller one - how mighty you could feel when carrying a gun. How inhuman you become just because of possessing it. But when it comes to the real killing - the fully conscious one - you feel you have choice. And you choose. 2. The bigger story is the suffocating realization of the scale of the terror. You receive a detailed picture of the quiet torture that represents the everyday life of a great part of the humans in "civilized Europe" (and America, and Asia, and Africa, and Australia). Just for the case they are gathered in Paris. This movie won't be seen by any of the people who live such kind of life. Pity. But any of the rest is obliged not to remain indifferent.

    20 Hours of self-destructive wandering on behalf of three kids living in the suburbs of Paris. The scenario is the aftermath of the previous night's violent riots, in which a friend of theirs, Abdel, was injured and is in the hospital, in a coma. One of the friends finds a gun, he declares that if Abdel dies, he will kill a cop. The tension never lingers on the surface, but it's always present. Stylishly directed by d&eacute;butante Mathieu Kassovitz, who also shows a great ability to lead his cast (a young and also d&eacute;butante Vincent Cassel stands out the most). The movie is a bitter reflection on hate (like the title rightfully implies), on its justification and its manifestation. A gray portrait of how anger causes an irrational sense of isolationism, how it pushes away any form of respectable human contact, creating a wall that doesn't protect, it only traps. Winner for Best Director at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.

    While to most outsiders Paris seems the very picture of beauty and civility, France has had a long and unfortunate history of intolerance toward outsiders, and this powerful drama from filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz takes an unblinking look at a racially diverse group of young people trapped in the Parisian economic and social underclass.La Haine is a French black-and-white drama/suspense film written, co-edited, and directed by Kassovitz and it features Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kound&eacute;, Sa&iuml;d Taghmaoui, Abdel Ahmed Ghili and Solo. Vinz, who is Jewish, Hubert, who is Black, and Said, who is Arabic, are young men from the lower rungs of the French economic ladder; they have no jobs, few prospects, and no productive way to spend their time. They hang out and wander the streets as a way of filling their days and are sometimes caught up in frequent skirmishes between the police and other disaffected youth. One day, a street riot breaks out after police seriously injure an Arab student; the three friends are arrested and questioned, and it is learned that a policeman lost a gun in the chaos. However, what they don't know is that Vinz picked it up and has it in his possession, and when Vinz, Hubert, and Said get into a scuffle with a group of racist skinheads, the circumstances seem poised for tragedy. La Haine is a Generation X film, whatever that means, but more mature and insightful than the American Gen X movies.Kassovitz's iconic film about race, violence, and class struggle is both rousing entertainment and brilliant film making.And he mines so much tension and pointed dialogue from a low budget and deceptively simple premise that you wonder why so much of current Hollywood's own social realism ends up shooting $50 million blanks.A great film indeed.

It's how you land!" They are falling, but they are lying to themselves on the way down, and when they touch the ground, it won't end happily. La haine (Hate) is simple, yet powerful name for movie. It fits perfectly with its main theme. Hate. Unreasonable hate. People who hate something or someone because their friends and idols do that, because it's popular, because they want to feel accepted by the group. It's not a problem in violence, it's a problem in its cause. Whole film is filled with the symbols. I noticed some of them, I read some of the messages, but I'm sure that there are many more that I will catch on the second watching. Episode with the old man in the toilet? Brilliant. Whole symbolic Grunwalski story about the pride and death and the way it was told. Tadek Lokcinski like a prophet here, totally steals the scene in a few minutes of his appearance. A strong moral behind the story, but the boys can't understand it yet. It will cost them, so they will learn it on the hard way. Paroles on the walls that we can see everywhere around the city. One of them "The World is yours" (Said corrected it to "The World is ours") is the main motto of these young men. They want to try everything, and they want it now, but they don't see the hole on the end of the road they went. This also may indicate Scarface, which contains similar messages. One more thing that I found interesting was the picture of the poet, Charles Baudelaire on the building at the end of the movie, and I am sure that this isn't randomly put there. Baudelaire wrote the poem called "Le Tonneau de la Haine" (The Cask of Hate) so there's an obvious connection. I like the fact that the characters have the same names as the actors that play them. Crime isn't glorified in this movie, neither is the law. Violence is strongly criticized, modern society isn't spared either. Nothing is exaggerated, this is pretty realistic picture of what's happening around and inside us. We can get to like the characters, but it would be wrong if we agreed with most of their deeds. Did we learn something from this movie? Well, we learned plenty of things. Paris, so as the world, isn't just a city of love, there are "black and gray" sides of it. It may be easy to tell, but not to do. Especially to pull the trigger and kill the face in front of you. Neither side of the conflict is absolutely right or absolutely wrong. Sometimes is better to swallow the pride. Batman is not so strong. Directing and camera work are great, acting too, dialogs are smooth and interesting even with the English subtitles, so I can only dream how much this is enjoyable for the French speaker. Soundtrack is one more great part of the film. I didn't write the flaws of the movie because when I watch some gem of the cinema like this one, I try to concentrate on the good parts of it, and as I said, La haine is full of them. And still, there are many things that I forgot to write, or missed while I was watching. 10/10 I suggest it to everyone, don't be repelled by the bunch of kids who try to identify with the characters in this movie.

    I know everyone liked this film, but probably none have been around Arrondissements like 18. This is not Mean Streets but a couple of lame dudes who would have been beaten with bats had they lived in Brooklyn or Bronx. The movie is a great example of why we need Arrondissements like 18, to keep these hooligans penned up. It does not even come close to Battle for Algiers in terms of cinema verite realism. There are much better French films than this pretentious attempt. Sure lighting and black/white photography was great, direction great, actors superb but there was no really original story or insight. The handling of the three main actors was really very, very well done: Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kounde, Said Taghmaui - talk about three amigos. But script seemed very flat... as they just bum around from one scene to the next being stupid with little or no insight. No real insight into their lives, families, other friends, environment. They are simply pugs with no original thoughts other than, "I got to get out of here". ! Brilliant. They sure knew how to navigate the art opening. Film Formula: take some skin heads, bad cops, some pugs, the projects as background: stir, walla ! a movie. But if no one has been near the real deal and only read about it..oh, my gosh honey...look at their conditions! "And such one dimensional characters. See what the projects create" No insight whatsoever except standard clich&eacute;s which to white people are 'oh so enlightening". Really. Do you talk about this 'insightful' movie at wine and cheese art openings. Somehow the film represents 24 hrs in their lives. It feels more like 72 hours. Go see Banksy instead. You will be well rewarded.

    ... the very moment he passed the gun to his friend. Ugly movie. Noisy, disgusting even. Also childish and innocent. At least 2 stories in it: 1. The smaller one - how mighty you could feel when carrying a gun. How inhuman you become just because of possessing it. But when it comes to the real killing - the fully conscious one - you feel you have choice. And you choose. 2. The bigger story is the suffocating realization of the scale of the terror. You receive a detailed picture of the quiet torture that represents the everyday life of a great part of the humans in "civilized Europe" (and America, and Asia, and Africa, and Australia). Just for the case they are gathered in Paris. This movie won't be seen by any of the people who live such kind of life. Pity. But any of the rest is obliged not to remain indifferent.

    20 Hours of self-destructive wandering on behalf of three kids living in the suburbs of Paris. The scenario is the aftermath of the previous night's violent riots, in which a friend of theirs, Abdel, was injured and is in the hospital, in a coma. One of the friends finds a gun, he declares that if Abdel dies, he will kill a cop. The tension never lingers on the surface, but it's always present. Stylishly directed by d&eacute;butante Mathieu Kassovitz, who also shows a great ability to lead his cast (a young and also d&eacute;butante Vincent Cassel stands out the most). The movie is a bitter reflection on hate (like the title rightfully implies), on its justification and its manifestation. A gray portrait of how anger causes an irrational sense of isolationism, how it pushes away any form of respectable human contact, creating a wall that doesn't protect, it only traps. Winner for Best Director at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.

    While to most outsiders Paris seems the very picture of beauty and civility, France has had a long and unfortunate history of intolerance toward outsiders, and this powerful drama from filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz takes an unblinking look at a racially diverse group of young people trapped in the Parisian economic and social underclass.La Haine is a French black-and-white drama/suspense film written, co-edited, and directed by Kassovitz and it features Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kound&eacute;, Sa&iuml;d Taghmaoui, Abdel Ahmed Ghili and Solo. Vinz, who is Jewish, Hubert, who is Black, and Said, who is Arabic, are young men from the lower rungs of the French economic ladder; they have no jobs, few prospects, and no productive way to spend their time. They hang out and wander the streets as a way of filling their days and are sometimes caught up in frequent skirmishes between the police and other disaffected youth. One day, a street riot breaks out after police seriously injure an Arab student; the three friends are arrested and questioned, and it is learned that a policeman lost a gun in the chaos. However, what they don't know is that Vinz picked it up and has it in his possession, and when Vinz, Hubert, and Said get into a scuffle with a group of racist skinheads, the circumstances seem poised for tragedy. La Haine is a Generation X film, whatever that means, but more mature and insightful than the American Gen X movies.Kassovitz's iconic film about race, violence, and class struggle is both rousing entertainment and brilliant film making.And he mines so much tension and pointed dialogue from a low budget and deceptively simple premise that you wonder why so much of current Hollywood's own social realism ends up shooting $50 million blanks.A great film indeed.

    "La Haine" is mostly liked by the french kids and teenagers because of it's reality to show the violence in the outskirts in France, mostly in the suburb of Paris. The film is full of morals and it's also why many peoples love it, it's like a fable. I enjoyed the movie also for the musics : mostly rap but it's what i listened majority when i saw this film for the first time. Vincent Cassel also make a reference to Taxi Driver by saying "you're talking to me?" front of his mirror, many teenagers thinks this sentence is from "La Haine" by the way. This movie show the reality in the outskirts in France but you can also think it has been shot in any other country. The violence is everywhere.

    Quiet possibly one of my favorite ever foreign language films and surely the rebirth of the French film industry that captivated millions around the world for so long. That's why I call this film; the French new wave part 2... To those outside France, it's the French version of Boyz N The Hood, to those in it and to myself, it's a unrestrained urban thriller that moves at such a ferocious pace, you often find yourself on the edge of your seat, clingy on to your arm rest for dear life. Mathieu Kassovitz effectively uses black and white to create art out of the all the crime and violence, mastering a fine tight rope between the rawness of a poor, urban backdrop and a piece of art work that would not look a bit out of place, if it were hung in a gallery next to painting by Picasso. Uncompromising in his attempt to tell a story loosely based on actual events, about riots that lasted for more than 10 years in the French capital, Kassovitz want to portray a story in a manner that makes the whole world stop, not only to serve as mere voyeurs, but instead to actually think. La Haine tells the story of three vastly different and conflicting characters; a Jew, an Arab and an African. That seems to come effortlessly together like a barber shop quartet. As they have to deal with the aftermath of events that lead to a young Arab teenager being beaten into a coma on the outskirts of a riot - Adding fuel to the ever growing, racial and political tension between the people in charge and the powerless individuals of the projects. While most of us feel safe watching violence, as long as it's on TV or film, as we are for the most part detached from what we are experiencing, but instead the aim of for this film, throughout the entire duration of the film, about a world that takes place in the course of one day, which is the time span in the film that seems to last a eternity, we are engrossed in the action throughout, so we are not comfortable or assured at all, instead we are almost bullied into reacting and reciprocate a feeling of tension, as is endured in the film between the cops and the residents of the project. But ultimately the underlying theme of the film is a sense of hopelessness, that is nothing will ever change! It's just a cycle. This is best represented during the opening monologue, and in the final few scenes, as a story is told and narrated, consisting of a man who jumps of a 50 story building, but to reassure himself he keeps repeating "so far, So good, so far, So good" as he hurtles to his death. This is used to show that this never ending cycle of violence and hate is never going to stop, soon enough resulting in society's demises. But no one seems to care. As long as they are surviving, they don't care when it's falling, but when it crashes, that's when they panic. Magnificent, awesome, a compulsive viewing! This is a poignant yet humorous reminder of the harsh reality of people living in the ghettos of France. Boyz N The Hood was a great film, but it is almost eclipsed by this masterpiece and that's saying allot. A must watch. 'The world is ours'

    Just as relevant today as when it was made, La Haine (or Hate) captures the difficulties faced by disenfranchised youth in France. The news of rioting in France a couple of years ago made the film seem all too real. Looking back on the film, the film seems very prescient in foreshadowing the problems percolating beneath the surface in France. I imagine the economic slowdown since 2008 probably has made it even worse than what it was in the 90's. Powerful,gritty, and quite realistic portrait of contemporary France. The film is sort of a precursor to the rise of social realism in French films, with the Dardenne Brothers' works being the most successful example. The plot is a bit weak but the acting and the realism more than make up for it. Recommended for those who like social realism in films.

    La haine is an excellent movie a great proof that the old poetic oneiric movie-making is still alive. all the scenes in the movie are pure poetry transmitting this mysteriousness behind their symbols. Mathieu Kassovitz faces deep themes concerning human identity in contrast with a degrading society fuelled by hate. the title haine actually means hate, throughout the movie we witness hateful actions, hate against the different, hate that flows like blood in our streets and our souls. The movie means to show that our society is auto destructive, in fact it starts with a spoken quote "as a man is falling from a building he says to himself .so far so good, so far so good. the problem is not the fall, it's the impact to the ground:". The director uses this idea and puts it in a metaphors which is the story . The story takes place in Paris's projects during an ordinary day in the life of three friends Vinz, Hubert and Said each with a different personalty that react in their own way facing Society. the plot's growth represents a time bomb, time after time events worsten till we arrive to the end when the bomb explodes...BOOOM!! Another theme in the movie is the contrast between dream and reality. the main characters face events out of the ordinary (cow sighting) that are opposed by reality surrounding them, reality brings them back to earth and their illusory beliefs such as the vengeance of Vinz and Hubert's desire to escape. the events that follow each other contain a great unofficial magical realism influence, After a whole day and a night pass away composed by a dreamy and mysterious atmosphere; the morning comes and the harsh reality hits back making the bomb explode with the sure death of Vinz and the presumable of Hubert that it is obscured by the ending. Behind Grumwalski's story another theme is hidden which is relativism; every belief and faith an individual has is completely useless cause this life does not believe in you, and it is a complete absurdity without sense. GOODBYE SOUL BROTHERS

    "Reality", would be the simplest word for me to describe the main theme of this movie. Surely it depicts social, economical and racial factors but furthermore this is an analysis of human behaviour in its rawest form. Hate, anguish and sadness all correlate and it is my belief that these emotions have never been so clearly shown in a picture. I believe that any respectable, may it be American or European politician has to have seen this movie. It is filled with truths that are nothing but extremely valuable. It is relatable in so many ways; may it be because of the acting or simply because of the "heart aching" storyline. Contrary to preceding reviews I feel it is important to emphasize the way this film focuses on feelings of injustice, "HATE", and the power embedded in them. It is my belief that this movie is the most relevant of them all when it comes to portraying present realities and I challenge anyone to state the contrary. It is not only agonizing but revolting. I am myself of french, Swedish and algerian origins. Watch this movie and learn.

    I usually don't write reviews, but for this one I'll make exception because it caught my eye. Great film, as for the french cinema, so for the world. I guess I won't be able to say everything that's great about this film, but surely I will try. Mathieu Kassovitz is showing us one day in the life of three violent young men. One of them is Jewish (Vinz), one of them Arab (Sa&iuml;d), and the third one is black (Hubert). They live in a very violent hood full of riots. They're strongly involved in the conflict with the police. They don't have any other interests, except to become a wannabe street heroes, although Hubert does some boxing at the gym that has been burnt somewhere in the beginning of the movie. La haine starts with the scene of riots on the streets of France. I'm not informed when and why these things were happening, but it doesn't matter, cause they can happen every moment, in every corner of the world. In fact, these things are happening at this exact moment in which I'm writing. Opening scene is perfectly followed by Bob Marley's "Burnin' and Lootin", a sweet reggae melody. You can see some irony here. Then, we learn, from the TV news, that some Arabian guy has been wounded by the hand of the police. We meet the characters and then the story flows like a water. Story itself contains several events happening in a chronological order at different times of day. It is very well composed so we can understand the characters and the problems they're dealing with. They are chasing their identities and personalities. They are trying to be something what they consider to be right. But they are slaves of the modern society, and the slaves of the occasions in which they are. They are immature, they don't think before they do, and worst of all, they are hiding the truth from themselves. This is a story about the hunt for identity, about youth that is lost in the chaos of modern society, so when they try to find themselves, they actually become part of that chaos. "Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!" They are falling, but they are lying to themselves on the way down, and when they touch the ground, it won't end happily. La haine (Hate) is simple, yet powerful name for movie. It fits perfectly with its main theme. Hate. Unreasonable hate. People who hate something or someone because their friends and idols do that, because it's popular, because they want to feel accepted by the group. It's not a problem in violence, it's a problem in its cause. Whole film is filled with the symbols.

    Quiet possibly one of my favorite ever foreign language films and surely the rebirth of the French film industry that captivated millions around the world for so long. That's why I call this film; the French new wave part 2... To those outside France, it's the French version of Boyz N The Hood, to those in it and to myself, it's a unrestrained urban thriller that moves at such a ferocious pace, you often find yourself on the edge of your seat, clingy on to your arm rest for dear life. Mathieu Kassovitz effectively uses black and white to create art out of the all the crime and violence, mastering a fine tight rope between the rawness of a poor, urban backdrop and a piece of art work that would not look a bit out of place, if it were hung in a gallery next to painting by Picasso. Uncompromising in his attempt to tell a story loosely based on actual events, about riots that lasted for more than 10 years in the French capital, Kassovitz want to portray a story in a manner that makes the whole world stop, not only to serve as mere voyeurs, but instead to actually think. La Haine tells the story of three vastly different and conflicting characters; a Jew, an Arab and an African. That seems to come effortlessly together like a barber shop quartet. As they have to deal with the aftermath of events that lead to a young Arab teenager being beaten into a coma on the outskirts of a riot - Adding fuel to the ever growing, racial and political tension between the people in charge and the powerless individuals of the projects. While most of us feel safe watching violence, as long as it's on TV or film, as we are for the most part detached from what we are experiencing, but instead the aim of for this film, throughout the entire duration of the film, about a world that takes place in the course of one day, which is the time span in the film that seems to last a eternity, we are engrossed in the action throughout, so we are not comfortable or assured at all, instead we are almost bullied into reacting and reciprocate a feeling of tension, as is endured in the film between the cops and the residents of the project. But ultimately the underlying theme of the film is a sense of hopelessness, that is nothing will ever change! It's just a cycle. This is best represented during the opening monologue, and in the final few scenes, as a story is told and narrated, consisting of a man who jumps of a 50 story building, but to reassure himself he keeps repeating "so far, So good, so far, So good" as he hurtles to his death. This is used to show that this never ending cycle of violence and hate is never going to stop, soon enough resulting in society's demises. But no one seems to care. As long as they are surviving, they don't care when it's falling, but when it crashes, that's when they panic. Magnificent, awesome, a compulsive viewing! This is a poignant yet humorous reminder of the harsh reality of people living in the ghettos of France. Boyz N The Hood was a great film, but it is almost eclipsed by this masterpiece and that's saying allot. A must watch. 'The world is ours'

    Just as relevant today as when it was made, La Haine (or Hate) captures the difficulties faced by disenfranchised youth in France. The news of rioting in France a couple of years ago made the film seem all too real. Looking back on the film, the film seems very prescient in foreshadowing the problems percolating beneath the surface in France. I imagine the economic slowdown since 2008 probably has made it even worse than what it was in the 90's. Powerful,gritty, and quite realistic portrait of contemporary France. The film is sort of a precursor to the rise of social realism in French films, with the Dardenne Brothers' works being the most successful example. The plot is a bit weak but the acting and the realism more than make up for it. Recommended for those who like social realism in films.

    La haine is an excellent movie a great proof that the old poetic oneiric movie-making is still alive. all the scenes in the movie are pure poetry transmitting this mysteriousness behind their symbols. Mathieu Kassovitz faces deep themes concerning human identity in contrast with a degrading society fuelled by hate. the title haine actually means hate, throughout the movie we witness hateful actions, hate against the different, hate that flows like blood in our streets and our souls. The movie means to show that our society is auto destructive, in fact it starts with a spoken quote "as a man is falling from a building he says to himself .so far so good, so far so good. the problem is not the fall, it's the impact to the ground:". The director uses this idea and puts it in a metaphors which is the story . The story takes place in Paris's projects during an ordinary day in the life of three friends Vinz, Hubert and Said each with a different personalty that react in their own way facing Society. the plot's growth represents a time bomb, time after time events worsten till we arrive to the end when the bomb explodes...BOOOM!! Another theme in the movie is the contrast between dream and reality. the main characters face events out of the ordinary (cow sighting) that are opposed by reality surrounding them, reality brings them back to earth and their illusory beliefs such as the vengeance of Vinz and Hubert's desire to escape. the events that follow each other contain a great unofficial magical realism influence, After a whole day and a night pass away composed by a dreamy and mysterious atmosphere; the morning comes and the harsh reality hits back making the bomb explode with the sure death of Vinz and the presumable of Hubert that it is obscured by the ending. Behind Grumwalski's story another theme is hidden which is relativism; every belief and faith an individual has is completely useless cause this life does not believe in you, and it is a complete absurdity without sense.

    "Reality", would be the simplest word for me to describe the main theme of this movie. Surely it depicts social, economical and racial factors but furthermore this is an analysis of human behaviour in its rawest form. Hate, anguish and sadness all correlate and it is my belief that these emotions have never been so clearly shown in a picture. I believe that any respectable, may it be American or European politician has to have seen this movie. It is filled with truths that are nothing but extremely valuable. It is relatable in so many ways; may it be because of the acting or simply because of the "heart aching" storyline. Contrary to preceding reviews I feel it is important to emphasize the way this film focuses on feelings of injustice, "HATE", and the power embedded in them. It is my belief that this movie is the most relevant of them all when it comes to portraying present realities and I challenge anyone to state the contrary. It is not only agonizing but revolting. I am myself of french, Swedish and algerian origins. Watch this movie and learn.

    I usually don't write reviews, but for this one I'll make exception because it caught my eye. Great film, as for the french cinema, so for the world. I guess I won't be able to say everything that's great about this film, but surely I will try. Mathieu Kassovitz is showing us one day in the life of three violent young men. One of them is Jewish (Vinz), one of them Arab (Sa&iuml;d), and the third one is black (Hubert). They live in a very violent hood full of riots. They're strongly involved in the conflict with the police. They don't have any other interests, except to become a wannabe street heroes, although Hubert does some boxing at the gym that has been burnt somewhere in the beginning of the movie. La haine starts with the scene of riots on the streets of France. I'm not informed when and why these things were happening, but it doesn't matter, cause they can happen every moment, in every corner of the world. In fact, these things are happening at this exact moment in which I'm writing. Opening scene is perfectly followed by Bob Marley's "Burnin' and Lootin", a sweet reggae melody. You can see some irony here. Then, we learn, from the TV news, that some Arabian guy has been wounded by the hand of the police. We meet the characters and then the story flows like a water. Story itself contains several events happening in a chronological order at different times of day. It is very well composed so we can understand the characters and the problems they're dealing with. They are chasing their identities and personalities. They are trying to be something what they consider to be right. But they are slaves of the modern society, and the slaves of the occasions in which they are. They are immature, they don't think before they do, and worst of all, they are hiding the truth from themselves. This is a story about the hunt for identity, about youth that is lost in the chaos of modern society, so when they try to find themselves, they actually become part of that chaos. "Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!" They are falling, but they are lying to themselves on the way down, and when they touch the ground, it won't end happily. La haine (Hate) is simple, yet powerful name for movie. It fits perfectly with its main theme. Hate. Unreasonable hate. People who hate something or someone because their friends and idols do that, because it's popular, because they want to feel accepted by the group. It's not a problem in violence, it's a problem in its cause. Whole film is filled with the symbols. I noticed some of them, I read some of the messages, but I'm sure that there are many more that I will catch on the second watching. Episode with the old man in the toilet? Brilliant. Whole symbolic Grunwalski story about the pride and death and the way it was told. Tadek Lokcinski like a prophet here, totally steals the scene in a few minutes of his appearance. A strong moral behind the story, but the boys can't understand it yet. It will cost them, so they will learn it on the hard way. Paroles on the walls that we can see everywhere around the city. One of them "The World is yours" (Said corrected it to "The World is ours") is the main motto of these young men. They want to try everything, and they want it now, but they don't see the hole on the end of the road they went. This also may indicate Scarface, which contains similar messages. One more thing that I found interesting was the picture of the poet, Charles Baudelaire on the building at the end of the movie, and I am sure that this isn't randomly put there. Baudelaire wrote the poem called "Le Tonneau de la Haine" (The Cask of Hate) so there's an obvious connection. I like the fact that the characters have the same names as the actors that play them. Crime isn't glorified in this movie, neither is the law. Violence is strongly criticized, modern society isn't spared either. Nothing is exaggerated, this is pretty realistic picture of what's happening around and inside us. We can get to like the characters, but it would be wrong if we agreed with most of their deeds. Did we learn something from this movie? Well, we learned plenty of things. Paris, so as the world, isn't just a city of love, there are "black and gray" sides of it. It may be easy to tell, but not to do. Especially to pull the trigger and kill the face in front of you. Neither side of the conflict is absolutely right or absolutely wrong. Sometimes is better to swallow the pride. Batman is not so strong. Directing and camera work are great, acting too, dialogs are smooth and interesting even with the English subtitles, so I can only dream how much this is enjoyable for the French speaker. Soundtrack is one more great part of the film. I didn't write the flaws of the movie because when I watch some gem of the cinema like this one, I try to concentrate on the good parts of it, and as I said, La haine is full of them. And still, there are many things that I forgot to write, or missed while I was watching. 10/10 I suggest it to everyone, don't be repelled by the bunch of kids who try to identify with the characters in this movie.

    I know everyone liked this film, but probably none have been around Arrondissements like 18. This is not Mean Streets but a couple of lame dudes who would have been beaten with bats had they lived in Brooklyn or Bronx. The movie is a great example of why we need Arrondissements like 18, to keep these hooligans penned up. It does not even come close to Battle for Algiers in terms of cinema verite realism. There are much better French films than this pretentious attempt. Sure lighting and black/white photography was great, direction great, actors superb but there was no really original story or insight. The handling of the three main actors was really very, very well done: Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kounde, Said Taghmaui - talk about three amigos. But script seemed very flat... as they just bum around from one scene to the next being stupid with little or no insight. No real insight into their lives, families, other friends, environment. They are simply pugs with no original thoughts other than, "I got to get out of here". ! Brilliant. They sure knew how to navigate the art opening. Film Formula: take some skin heads, bad cops, some pugs, the projects as background: stir, walla ! a movie. But if no one has been near the real deal and only read about it..oh, my gosh honey...look at their conditions! "And such one dimensional characters. See what the projects create" No insight whatsoever except standard clich&eacute;s which to white people are 'oh so enlightening". Really. Do you talk about this 'insightful' movie at wine and cheese art openings. Somehow the film represents 24 hrs in their lives. It feels more like 72 hours. Go see Banksy instead. You will be well rewarded.

    ... the very moment he passed the gun to his friend. Ugly movie. Noisy, disgusting even. Also childish and innocent. At least 2 stories in it: 1. The smaller one - how mighty you could feel when carrying a gun. How inhuman you become just because of possessing it. But when it comes to the real killing - the fully conscious one - you feel you have choice. And you choose. 2. The bigger story is the suffocating realization of the scale of the terror. You receive a detailed picture of the quiet torture that represents the everyday life of a great part of the humans in "civilized Europe" (and America, and Asia, and Africa, and Australia). Just for the case they are gathered in Paris. This movie won't be seen by any of the people who live such kind of life. Pity. But any of the rest is obliged not to remain indifferent.

    20 Hours of self-destructive wandering on behalf of three kids living in the suburbs of Paris. The scenario is the aftermath of the previous night's violent riots, in which a friend of theirs, Abdel, was injured and is in the hospital, in a coma. One of the friends finds a gun, he declares that if Abdel dies, he will kill a cop. The tension never lingers on the surface, but it's always present. Stylishly directed by d&eacute;butante Mathieu Kassovitz, who also shows a great ability to lead his cast (a young and also d&eacute;butante Vincent Cassel stands out the most). The movie is a bitter reflection on hate (like the title rightfully implies), on its justification and its manifestation. A gray portrait of how anger causes an irrational sense of isolationism, how it pushes away any form of respectable human contact, creating a wall that doesn't protect, it only traps. Winner for Best Director at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.

    While to most outsiders Paris seems the very picture of beauty and civility, France has had a long and unfortunate history of intolerance toward outsiders, and this powerful drama from filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz takes an unblinking look at a racially diverse group of young people trapped in the Parisian economic and social underclass.La Haine is a French black-and-white drama/suspense film written, co-edited, and directed by Kassovitz and it features Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kound&eacute;, Sa&iuml;d Taghmaoui, Abdel Ahmed Ghili and Solo. Vinz, who is Jewish, Hubert, who is Black, and Said, who is Arabic, are young men from the lower rungs of the French economic ladder; they have no jobs, few prospects, and no productive way to spend their time. They hang out and wander the streets as a way of filling their days and are sometimes caught up in frequent skirmishes between the police and other disaffected youth. One day, a street riot breaks out after police seriously injure an Arab student; the three friends are arrested and questioned, and it is learned that a policeman lost a gun in the chaos. However, what they don't know is that Vinz picked it up and has it in his possession, and when Vinz, Hubert, and Said get into a scuffle with a group of racist skinheads, the circumstances seem poised for tragedy. La Haine is a Generation X film, whatever that means, but more mature and insightful than the American Gen X movies.Kassovitz's iconic film about race, violence, and class struggle is both rousing entertainment and brilliant film making.And he mines so much tension and pointed dialogue from a low budget and deceptively simple premise that you wonder why so much of current Hollywood's own social realism ends up shooting $50 million blanks.A great film indeed.

    "La Haine" is mostly liked by the french kids and teenagers because of it's reality to show the violence in the outskirts in France, mostly in the suburb of Paris. The film is full of morals and it's also why many peoples love it, it's like a fable. I enjoyed the movie also for the musics : mostly rap but it's what i listened majority when i saw this film for the first time. Vincent Cassel also make a reference to Taxi Driver by saying "you're talking to me?" front of his mirror, many teenagers thinks this sentence is from "La Haine" by the way. This movie show the reality in the outskirts in France but you can also think it has been shot in any other country. The violence is everywhere.

One more thing that I found interesting was the picture of the poet, Charles Baudelaire on the building at the end of the movie, and I am sure that this isn't randomly put there. Baudelaire wrote the poem called "Le Tonneau de la Haine" (The Cask of Hate) so there's an obvious connection. I like the fact that the characters have the same names as the actors that play them. Crime isn't glorified in this movie, neither is the law. Violence is strongly criticized, modern society isn't spared either. Nothing is exaggerated, this is pretty realistic picture of what's happening around and inside us. We can get to like the characters, but it would be wrong if we agreed with most of their deeds. Did we learn something from this movie? Well, we learned plenty of things. Paris, so as the world, isn't just a city of love, there are "black and gray" sides of it. It may be easy to tell, but not to do. Especially to pull the trigger and kill the face in front of you. Neither side of the conflict is absolutely right or absolutely wrong. Sometimes is better to swallow the pride. Batman is not so strong. Directing and camera work are great, acting too, dialogs are smooth and interesting even with the English subtitles, so I can only dream how much this is enjoyable for the French speaker. Soundtrack is one more great part of the film. I didn't write the flaws of the movie because when I watch some gem of the cinema like this one, I try to concentrate on the good parts of it, and as I said, La haine is full of them. And still, there are many things that I forgot to write, or missed while I was watching. 10/10 I suggest it to everyone, don't be repelled by the bunch of kids who try to identify with the characters in this movie.

    I know everyone liked this film, but probably none have been around Arrondissements like 18. This is not Mean Streets but a couple of lame dudes who would have been beaten with bats had they lived in Brooklyn or Bronx. The movie is a great example of why we need Arrondissements like 18, to keep these hooligans penned up. It does not even come close to Battle for Algiers in terms of cinema verite realism. There are much better French films than this pretentious attempt. Sure lighting and black/white photography was great, direction great, actors superb but there was no really original story or insight. The handling of the three main actors was really very, very well done: Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kounde, Said Taghmaui - talk about three amigos. But script seemed very flat... as they just bum around from one scene to the next being stupid with little or no insight. No real insight into their lives, families, other friends, environment. They are simply pugs with no original thoughts other than, "I got to get out of here". ! Brilliant. They sure knew how to navigate the art opening. Film Formula: take some skin heads, bad cops, some pugs, the projects as background: stir, walla ! a movie. But if no one has been near the real deal and only read about it..oh, my gosh honey...look at their conditions! "And such one dimensional characters. See what the projects create" No insight whatsoever except standard clich&eacute;s which to white people are 'oh so enlightening". Really. Do you talk about this 'insightful' movie at wine and cheese art openings. Somehow the film represents 24 hrs in their lives. It feels more like 72 hours. Go see Banksy instead. You will be well rewarded.

    ... the very moment he passed the gun to his friend. Ugly movie. Noisy, disgusting even. Also childish and innocent. At least 2 stories in it: 1. The smaller one - how mighty you could feel when carrying a gun. How inhuman you become just because of possessing it. But when it comes to the real killing - the fully conscious one - you feel you have choice. And you choose. 2. The bigger story is the suffocating realization of the scale of the terror. You receive a detailed picture of the quiet torture that represents the everyday life of a great part of the humans in "civilized Europe" (and America, and Asia, and Africa, and Australia). Just for the case they are gathered in Paris. This movie won't be seen by any of the people who live such kind of life. Pity. But any of the rest is obliged not to remain indifferent.

    20 Hours of self-destructive wandering on behalf of three kids living in the suburbs of Paris. The scenario is the aftermath of the previous night's violent riots, in which a friend of theirs, Abdel, was injured and is in the hospital, in a coma. One of the friends finds a gun, he declares that if Abdel dies, he will kill a cop. The tension never lingers on the surface, but it's always present. Stylishly directed by d&eacute;butante Mathieu Kassovitz, who also shows a great ability to lead his cast (a young and also d&eacute;butante Vincent Cassel stands out the most). The movie is a bitter reflection on hate (like the title rightfully implies), on its justification and its manifestation. A gray portrait of how anger causes an irrational sense of isolationism, how it pushes away any form of respectable human contact, creating a wall that doesn't protect, it only traps. Winner for Best Director at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.

    While to most outsiders Paris seems the very picture of beauty and civility, France has had a long and unfortunate history of intolerance toward outsiders, and this powerful drama from filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz takes an unblinking look at a racially diverse group of young people trapped in the Parisian economic and social underclass.La Haine is a French black-and-white drama/suspense film written, co-edited, and directed by Kassovitz and it features Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kound&eacute;, Sa&iuml;d Taghmaoui, Abdel Ahmed Ghili and Solo. Vinz, who is Jewish, Hubert, who is Black, and Said, who is Arabic, are young men from the lower rungs of the French economic ladder; they have no jobs, few prospects, and no productive way to spend their time. They hang out and wander the streets as a way of filling their days and are sometimes caught up in frequent skirmishes between the police and other disaffected youth. One day, a street riot breaks out after police seriously injure an Arab student; the three friends are arrested and questioned, and it is learned that a policeman lost a gun in the chaos. However, what they don't know is that Vinz picked it up and has it in his possession, and when Vinz, Hubert, and Said get into a scuffle with a group of racist skinheads, the circumstances seem poised for tragedy. La Haine is a Generation X film, whatever that means, but more mature and insightful than the American Gen X movies.Kassovitz's iconic film about race, violence, and class struggle is both rousing entertainment and brilliant film making.And he mines so much tension and pointed dialogue from a low budget and deceptively simple premise that you wonder why so much of current Hollywood's own social realism ends up shooting $50 million blanks.A great film indeed.

    "La Haine" is mostly liked by the french kids and teenagers because of it's reality to show the violence in the outskirts in France, mostly in the suburb of Paris. The film is full of morals and it's also why many peoples love it, it's like a fable. I enjoyed the movie also for the musics : mostly rap but it's what i listened majority when i saw this film for the first time. Vincent Cassel also make a reference to Taxi Driver by saying "you're talking to me?" front of his mirror, many teenagers thinks this sentence is from "La Haine" by the way. This movie show the reality in the outskirts in France but you can also think it has been shot in any other country. The violence is everywhere.

    Quiet possibly one of my favorite ever foreign language films and surely the rebirth of the French film industry that captivated millions around the world for so long. That's why I call this film; the French new wave part 2... To those outside France, it's the French version of Boyz N The Hood, to those in it and to myself, it's a unrestrained urban thriller that moves at such a ferocious pace, you often find yourself on the edge of your seat, clingy on to your arm rest for dear life. Mathieu Kassovitz effectively uses black and white to create art out of the all the crime and violence, mastering a fine tight rope between the rawness of a poor, urban backdrop and a piece of art work that would not look a bit out of place, if it were hung in a gallery next to painting by Picasso. Uncompromising in his attempt to tell a story loosely based on actual events, about riots that lasted for more than 10 years in the French capital, Kassovitz want to portray a story in a manner that makes the whole world stop, not only to serve as mere voyeurs, but instead to actually think. La Haine tells the story of three vastly different and conflicting characters; a Jew, an Arab and an African. That seems to come effortlessly together like a barber shop quartet. As they have to deal with the aftermath of events that lead to a young Arab teenager being beaten into a coma on the outskirts of a riot - Adding fuel to the ever growing, racial and political tension between the people in charge and the powerless individuals of the projects. While most of us feel safe watching violence, as long as it's on TV or film, as we are for the most part detached from what we are experiencing, but instead the aim of for this film, throughout the entire duration of the film, about a world that takes place in the course of one day, which is the time span in the film that seems to last a eternity, we are engrossed in the action throughout, so we are not comfortable or assured at all, instead we are almost bullied into reacting and reciprocate a feeling of tension, as is endured in the film between the cops and the residents of the project. But ultimately the underlying theme of the film is a sense of hopelessness, that is nothing will ever change! It's just a cycle. This is best represented during the opening monologue, and in the final few scenes, as a story is told and narrated, consisting of a man who jumps of a 50 story building, but to reassure himself he keeps repeating "so far, So good, so far, So good" as he hurtles to his death. This is used to show that this never ending cycle of violence and hate is never going to stop, soon enough resulting in society's demises. But no one seems to care. As long as they are surviving, they don't care when it's falling, but when it crashes, that's when they panic. Magnificent, awesome, a compulsive viewing! This is a poignant yet humorous reminder of the harsh reality of people living in the ghettos of France. Boyz N The Hood was a great film, but it is almost eclipsed by this masterpiece and that's saying allot. A must watch. 'The world is ours'

    Just as relevant today as when it was made, La Haine (or Hate) captures the difficulties faced by disenfranchised youth in France. The news of rioting in France a couple of years ago made the film seem all too real. Looking back on the film, the film seems very prescient in foreshadowing the problems percolating beneath the surface in France. I imagine the economic slowdown since 2008 probably has made it even worse than what it was in the 90's. Powerful,gritty, and quite realistic portrait of contemporary France. The film is sort of a precursor to the rise of social realism in French films, with the Dardenne Brothers' works being the most successful example. The plot is a bit weak but the acting and the realism more than make up for it. Recommended for those who like social realism in films.

    La haine is an excellent movie a great proof that the old poetic oneiric movie-making is still alive. all the scenes in the movie are pure poetry transmitting this mysteriousness behind their symbols. Mathieu Kassovitz faces deep themes concerning human identity in contrast with a degrading society fuelled by hate. the title haine actually means hate, throughout the movie we witness hateful actions, hate against the different, hate that flows like blood in our streets and our souls. The movie means to show that our society is auto destructive, in fact it starts with a spoken quote "as a man is falling from a building he says to himself .so far so good, so far so good. the problem is not the fall, it's the impact to the ground:". The director uses this idea and puts it in a metaphors which is the story . The story takes place in Paris's projects during an ordinary day in the life of three friends Vinz, Hubert and Said each with a different personalty that react in their own way facing Society. the plot's growth represents a time bomb, time after time events worsten till we arrive to the end when the bomb explodes...BOOOM!! Another theme in the movie is the contrast between dream and reality. the main characters face events out of the ordinary (cow sighting) that are opposed by reality surrounding them, reality brings them back to earth and their illusory beliefs such as the vengeance of Vinz and Hubert's desire to escape. the events that follow each other contain a great unofficial magical realism influence, After a whole day and a night pass away composed by a dreamy and mysterious atmosphere; the morning comes and the harsh reality hits back making the bomb explode with the sure death of Vinz and the presumable of Hubert that it is obscured by the ending. Behind Grumwalski's story another theme is hidden which is relativism; every belief and faith an individual has is completely useless cause this life does not believe in you, and it is a complete absurdity without sense. GOODBYE SOUL BROTHERS

    "Reality", would be the simplest word for me to describe the main theme of this movie. Surely it depicts social, economical and racial factors but furthermore this is an analysis of human behaviour in its rawest form. Hate, anguish and sadness all correlate and it is my belief that these emotions have never been so clearly shown in a picture. I believe that any respectable, may it be American or European politician has to have seen this movie. It is filled with truths that are nothing but extremely valuable. It is relatable in so many ways; may it be because of the acting or simply because of the "heart aching" storyline. Contrary to preceding reviews I feel it is important to emphasize the way this film focuses on feelings of injustice, "HATE", and the power embedded in them. It is my belief that this movie is the most relevant of them all when it comes to portraying present realities and I challenge anyone to state the contrary. It is not only agonizing but revolting. I am myself of french, Swedish and algerian origins. Watch this movie and learn.

    I usually don't write reviews, but for this one I'll make exception because it caught my eye. Great film, as for the french cinema, so for the world. I guess I won't be able to say everything that's great about this film, but surely I will try. Mathieu Kassovitz is showing us one day in the life of three violent young men. One of them is Jewish (Vinz), one of them Arab (Sa&iuml;d), and the third one is black (Hubert). They live in a very violent hood full of riots. They're strongly involved in the conflict with the police. They don't have any other interests, except to become a wannabe street heroes, although Hubert does some boxing at the gym that has been burnt somewhere in the beginning of the movie. La haine starts with the scene of riots on the streets of France. I'm not informed when and why these things were happening, but it doesn't matter, cause they can happen every moment, in every corner of the world. In fact, these things are happening at this exact moment in which I'm writing. Opening scene is perfectly followed by Bob Marley's "Burnin' and Lootin", a sweet reggae melody. You can see some irony here. Then, we learn, from the TV news, that some Arabian guy has been wounded by the hand of the police. We meet the characters and then the story flows like a water. Story itself contains several events happening in a chronological order at different times of day. It is very well composed so we can understand the characters and the problems they're dealing with. They are chasing their identities and personalities. They are trying to be something what they consider to be right. But they are slaves of the modern society, and the slaves of the occasions in which they are. They are immature, they don't think before they do, and worst of all, they are hiding the truth from themselves. This is a story about the hunt for identity, about youth that is lost in the chaos of modern society, so when they try to find themselves, they actually become part of that chaos. "Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!" They are falling, but they are lying to themselves on the way down, and when they touch the ground, it won't end happily. La haine (Hate) is simple, yet powerful name for movie. It fits perfectly with its main theme. Hate. Unreasonable hate. People who hate something or someone because their friends and idols do that, because it's popular, because they want to feel accepted by the group. It's not a problem in violence, it's a problem in its cause. Whole film is filled with the symbols. I noticed some of them, I read some of the messages, but I'm sure that there are many more that I will catch on the second watching. Episode with the old man in the toilet? Brilliant. Whole symbolic Grunwalski story about the pride and death and the way it was told. Tadek Lokcinski like a prophet here, totally steals the scene in a few minutes of his appearance. A strong moral behind the story, but the boys can't understand it yet. It will cost them, so they will learn it on the hard way. Paroles on the walls that we can see everywhere around the city. One of them "The World is yours" (Said corrected it to "The World is ours") is the main motto of these young men. They want to try everything, and they want it now, but they don't see the hole on the end of the road they went. This also may indicate Scarface, which contains similar messages. One more thing that I found interesting was the picture of the poet, Charles Baudelaire on the building at the end of the movie, and I am sure that this isn't randomly put there. Baudelaire wrote the poem called "Le Tonneau de la Haine" (The Cask of Hate) so there's an obvious connection. I like the fact that the characters have the same names as the actors that play them. Crime isn't glorified in this movie, neither is the law. Violence is strongly criticized, modern society isn't spared either. Nothing is exaggerated, this is pretty realistic picture of what's happening around and inside us. We can get to like the characters, but it would be wrong if we agreed with most of their deeds.

While most of us feel safe watching violence, as long as it's on TV or film, as we are for the most part detached from what we are experiencing, but instead the aim of for this film, throughout the entire duration of the film, about a world that takes place in the course of one day, which is the time span in the film that seems to last a eternity, we are engrossed in the action throughout, so we are not comfortable or assured at all, instead we are almost bullied into reacting and reciprocate a feeling of tension, as is endured in the film between the cops and the residents of the project. But ultimately the underlying theme of the film is a sense of hopelessness, that is nothing will ever change! It's just a cycle. This is best represented during the opening monologue, and in the final few scenes, as a story is told and narrated, consisting of a man who jumps of a 50 story building, but to reassure himself he keeps repeating "so far, So good, so far, So good" as he hurtles to his death. This is used to show that this never ending cycle of violence and hate is never going to stop, soon enough resulting in society's demises. But no one seems to care. As long as they are surviving, they don't care when it's falling, but when it crashes, that's when they panic. Magnificent, awesome, a compulsive viewing! This is a poignant yet humorous reminder of the harsh reality of people living in the ghettos of France. Boyz N The Hood was a great film, but it is almost eclipsed by this masterpiece and that's saying allot. A must watch. 'The world is ours'

    Just as relevant today as when it was made, La Haine (or Hate) captures the difficulties faced by disenfranchised youth in France. The news of rioting in France a couple of years ago made the film seem all too real. Looking back on the film, the film seems very prescient in foreshadowing the problems percolating beneath the surface in France. I imagine the economic slowdown since 2008 probably has made it even worse than what it was in the 90's. Powerful,gritty, and quite realistic portrait of contemporary France. The film is sort of a precursor to the rise of social realism in French films, with the Dardenne Brothers' works being the most successful example. The plot is a bit weak but the acting and the realism more than make up for it. Recommended for those who like social realism in films.

    La haine is an excellent movie a great proof that the old poetic oneiric movie-making is still alive. all the scenes in the movie are pure poetry transmitting this mysteriousness behind their symbols. Mathieu Kassovitz faces deep themes concerning human identity in contrast with a degrading society fuelled by hate. the title haine actually means hate, throughout the movie we witness hateful actions, hate against the different, hate that flows like blood in our streets and our souls. The movie means to show that our society is auto destructive, in fact it starts with a spoken quote "as a man is falling from a building he says to himself .so far so good, so far so good. the problem is not the fall, it's the impact to the ground:". The director uses this idea and puts it in a metaphors which is the story . The story takes place in Paris's projects during an ordinary day in the life of three friends Vinz, Hubert and Said each with a different personalty that react in their own way facing Society. the plot's growth represents a time bomb, time after time events worsten till we arrive to the end when the bomb explodes...BOOOM!! Another theme in the movie is the contrast between dream and reality. the main characters face events out of the ordinary (cow sighting) that are opposed by reality surrounding them, reality brings them back to earth and their illusory beliefs such as the vengeance of Vinz and Hubert's desire to escape. the events that follow each other contain a great unofficial magical realism influence, After a whole day and a night pass away composed by a dreamy and mysterious atmosphere; the morning comes and the harsh reality hits back making the bomb explode with the sure death of Vinz and the presumable of Hubert that it is obscured by the ending. Behind Grumwalski's story another theme is hidden which is relativism; every belief and faith an individual has is completely useless cause this life does not believe in you, and it is a complete absurdity without sense. GOODBYE SOUL BROTHERS

    "Reality", would be the simplest word for me to describe the main theme of this movie. Surely it depicts social, economical and racial factors but furthermore this is an analysis of human behaviour in its rawest form. Hate, anguish and sadness all correlate and it is my belief that these emotions have never been so clearly shown in a picture. I believe that any respectable, may it be American or European politician has to have seen this movie. It is filled with truths that are nothing but extremely valuable. It is relatable in so many ways; may it be because of the acting or simply because of the "heart aching" storyline. Contrary to preceding reviews I feel it is important to emphasize the way this film focuses on feelings of injustice, "HATE", and the power embedded in them. It is my belief that this movie is the most relevant of them all when it comes to portraying present realities and I challenge anyone to state the contrary. It is not only agonizing but revolting. I am myself of french, Swedish and algerian origins. Watch this movie and learn.

    I usually don't write reviews, but for this one I'll make exception because it caught my eye. Great film, as for the french cinema, so for the world. I guess I won't be able to say everything that's great about this film, but surely I will try. Mathieu Kassovitz is showing us one day in the life of three violent young men. One of them is Jewish (Vinz), one of them Arab (Sa&iuml;d), and the third one is black (Hubert). They live in a very violent hood full of riots. They're strongly involved in the conflict with the police. They don't have any other interests, except to become a wannabe street heroes, although Hubert does some boxing at the gym that has been burnt somewhere in the beginning of the movie. La haine starts with the scene of riots on the streets of France. I'm not informed when and why these things were happening, but it doesn't matter, cause they can happen every moment, in every corner of the world. In fact, these things are happening at this exact moment in which I'm writing. Opening scene is perfectly followed by Bob Marley's "Burnin' and Lootin", a sweet reggae melody. You can see some irony here. Then, we learn, from the TV news, that some Arabian guy has been wounded by the hand of the police. We meet the characters and then the story flows like a water. Story itself contains several events happening in a chronological order at different times of day. It is very well composed so we can understand the characters and the problems they're dealing with. They are chasing their identities and personalities. They are trying to be something what they consider to be right. But they are slaves of the modern society, and the slaves of the occasions in which they are. They are immature, they don't think before they do, and worst of all, they are hiding the truth from themselves. This is a story about the hunt for identity, about youth that is lost in the chaos of modern society, so when they try to find themselves, they actually become part of that chaos. "Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself: So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!" They are falling, but they are lying to themselves on the way down, and when they touch the ground, it won't end happily. La haine (Hate) is simple, yet powerful name for movie. It fits perfectly with its main theme. Hate. Unreasonable hate. People who hate something or someone because their friends and idols do that, because it's popular, because they want to feel accepted by the group. It's not a problem in violence, it's a problem in its cause. Whole film is filled with the symbols. I noticed some of them, I read some of the messages, but I'm sure that there are many more that I will catch on the second watching. Episode with the old man in the toilet? Brilliant. Whole symbolic Grunwalski story about the pride and death and the way it was told. Tadek Lokcinski like a prophet here, totally steals the scene in a few minutes of his appearance. A strong moral behind the story, but the boys can't understand it yet. It will cost them, so they will learn it on the hard way. Paroles on the walls that we can see everywhere around the city. One of them "The World is yours" (Said corrected it to "The World is ours") is the main motto of these young men. They want to try everything, and they want it now, but they don't see the hole on the end of the road they went. This also may indicate Scarface, which contains similar messages. One more thing that I found interesting was the picture of the poet, Charles Baudelaire on the building at the end of the movie, and I am sure that this isn't randomly put there. Baudelaire wrote the poem called "Le Tonneau de la Haine" (The Cask of Hate) so there's an obvious connection. I like the fact that the characters have the same names as the actors that play them. Crime isn't glorified in this movie, neither is the law. Violence is strongly criticized, modern society isn't spared either. Nothing is exaggerated, this is pretty realistic picture of what's happening around and inside us. We can get to like the characters, but it would be wrong if we agreed with most of their deeds. Did we learn something from this movie? Well, we learned plenty of things. Paris, so as the world, isn't just a city of love, there are "black and gray" sides of it. It may be easy to tell, but not to do. Especially to pull the trigger and kill the face in front of you. Neither side of the conflict is absolutely right or absolutely wrong. Sometimes is better to swallow the pride. Batman is not so strong. Directing and camera work are great, acting too, dialogs are smooth and interesting even with the English subtitles, so I can only dream how much this is enjoyable for the French speaker. Soundtrack is one more great part of the film. I didn't write the flaws of the movie because when I watch some gem of the cinema like this one, I try to concentrate on the good parts of it, and as I said, La haine is full of them. And still, there are many things that I forgot to write, or missed while I was watching. 10/10 I suggest it to everyone, don't be repelled by the bunch of kids who try to identify with the characters in this movie.

    I know everyone liked this film, but probably none have been around Arrondissements like 18. This is not Mean Streets but a couple of lame dudes who would have been beaten with bats had they lived in Brooklyn or Bronx. The movie is a great example of why we need Arrondissements like 18, to keep these hooligans penned up. It does not even come close to Battle for Algiers in terms of cinema verite realism. There are much better French films than this pretentious attempt. Sure lighting and black/white photography was great, direction great, actors superb but there was no really original story or insight. The handling of the three main actors was really very, very well done: Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kounde, Said Taghmaui - talk about three amigos. But script seemed very flat... as they just bum around from one scene to the next being stupid with little or no insight. No real insight into their lives, families, other friends, environment. They are simply pugs with no original thoughts other than, "I got to get out of here". ! Brilliant. They sure knew how to navigate the art opening. Film Formula: take some skin heads, bad cops, some pugs, the projects as background: stir, walla ! a movie. But if no one has been near the real deal and only read about it..oh, my gosh honey...look at their conditions! "And such one dimensional characters. See what the projects create" No insight whatsoever except standard clich&eacute;s which to white people are 'oh so enlightening". Really. Do you talk about this 'insightful' movie at wine and cheese art openings. Somehow the film represents 24 hrs in their lives. It feels more like 72 hours. Go see Banksy instead. You will be well rewarded.

    ... the very moment he passed the gun to his friend. Ugly movie. Noisy, disgusting even. Also childish and innocent. At least 2 stories in it: 1. The smaller one - how mighty you could feel when carrying a gun. How inhuman you become just because of possessing it. But when it comes to the real killing - the fully conscious one - you feel you have choice. And you choose. 2. The bigger story is the suffocating realization of the scale of the terror. You receive a detailed picture of the quiet torture that represents the everyday life of a great part of the humans in "civilized Europe" (and America, and Asia, and Africa, and Australia). Just for the case they are gathered in Paris. This movie won't be seen by any of the people who live such kind of life. Pity. But any of the rest is obliged not to remain indifferent.

    20 Hours of self-destructive wandering on behalf of three kids living in the suburbs of Paris. The scenario is the aftermath of the previous night's violent riots, in which a friend of theirs, Abdel, was injured and is in the hospital, in a coma. One of the friends finds a gun, he declares that if Abdel dies, he will kill a cop. The tension never lingers on the surface, but it's always present. Stylishly directed by d&eacute;butante Mathieu Kassovitz, who also shows a great ability to lead his cast (a young and also d&eacute;butante Vincent Cassel stands out the most). The movie is a bitter reflection on hate (like the title rightfully implies), on its justification and its manifestation. A gray portrait of how anger causes an irrational sense of isolationism, how it pushes away any form of respectable human contact, creating a wall that doesn't protect, it only traps. Winner for Best Director at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.

    While to most outsiders Paris seems the very picture of beauty and civility, France has had a long and unfortunate history of intolerance toward outsiders, and this powerful drama from filmmaker Mathieu Kassovitz takes an unblinking look at a racially diverse group of young people trapped in the Parisian economic and social underclass.La Haine is a French black-and-white drama/suspense film written, co-edited, and directed by Kassovitz and it features Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kound&eacute;, Sa&iuml;d Taghmaoui, Abdel Ahmed Ghili and Solo. Vinz, who is Jewish, Hubert, who is Black, and Said, who is Arabic, are young men from the lower rungs of the French economic ladder; they have no jobs, few prospects, and no productive way to spend their time. They hang out and wander the streets as a way of filling their days and are sometimes caught up in frequent skirmishes between the police and other disaffected youth. One day, a street riot breaks out after police seriously injure an Arab student; the three friends are arrested and questioned, and it is learned that a policeman lost a gun in the chaos. However, what they don't know is that Vinz picked it up and has it in his possession, and when Vinz, Hubert, and Said get into a scuffle with a group of racist skinheads, the circumstances seem poised for tragedy. La Haine is a Generation X film, whatever that means, but more mature and insightful than the American Gen X movies.Kassovitz's iconic film about race, violence, and class struggle is both rousing entertainment and brilliant film making.And he mines so much tension and pointed dialogue from a low budget and deceptively simple premise that you wonder why so much of current Hollywood's own social realism ends up shooting $50 million blanks.A great film indeed.

    "La Haine" is mostly liked by the french kids and teenagers because of it's reality to show the violence in the outskirts in France, mostly in the suburb of Paris. The film is full of morals and it's also why many peoples love it, it's like a fable. I enjoyed the movie also for the musics : mostly rap but it's what i listened majority when i saw this film for the first time. Vincent Cassel also make a reference to Taxi Driver by saying "you're talking to me?" front of his mirror, many teenagers thinks this sentence is from "La Haine" by the way. This movie show the reality in the outskirts in France but you can also think it has been shot in any other country. The violence is everywhere.
