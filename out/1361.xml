    I saw this movie on video back in 1997, there was nothing particularly appealing about it but I saw it anyways. John Tuturro was in it is the main thing but the odd thing about this movie was it was part of the wave of films that came out post Pulp Fiction that tried to cash in. Some of these films could stand on their own, very few could. There was nothing very Tarantino-esquire about this film except that the cover looks like the one sheet for Roger Averys Killing Zoe. This movie is basically a comedy set in some neighborhood in New York, the characters are colorful especially the always wonderful Michael Badalucco. Badalucco plays the 40 year old virgin of the neighborhood. If anything this is more like a Spike Lee wannabee film, except its silly. This film isn't really a ten but it deserves a better rating.

    No one I know has seen it. I must have watched it about 20x's. Caught it on late night TV movie on Sydney's Channel 10. Somebody in programming knows it's good. Always tried to watch the reruns. At least 3x's in 4yrs on 10. Then, I'm on holiday in Thessalonika and there's a copy of the DVD in a roadside newspaper kiosk for 5 Euro! What the...?! I bought it. Philips were giving this movie away for some sort of corporate promo. How Hip! And I got a piece of leftover stock. Anytime I'm tired or need a bit of pep I watch this movie. It's a DVD I always include in my road pack (I'm a muso). The cast are quite obviously having a good time. The whole Torturo family are in it except the dad. And, having watched it so many times I'm still intrigued by some of the absolutely beautiful interactions between the cast. The dialogue is superb, timing is perfect, characters are so stupidly real. Funny, pathetic, like my own friends, but from another part of the world. Highly Recommended 10/10

    Eighty minutes is way too long for "The Search For One Eyed Jimmy" , about eighty minutes too long. It's always sort of annoying when a movie has no point, looks like it was shot by a twelve year old with a camcorder running amok, and totally wastes a decent cast. The movie oozes self applause, and is nothing more than an exercise in self glorification. Do not seek out "The Search For One Eyed Jimmy" unless you are able to fast forward through the tedious and boring parts, which is essentially the entire movie. This total waste of time should be avoided at all costs. I hated "The Search For One eyed Jimmy" and believe me you will too. - MERK

    I remember aimlessly wandering Blockbuster video one night in college looking for a movie I hadn't seen yet (a rarity) and I stumbled across this movie that had a bunch of actors I liked. I rented it, watched it, and boy am I glad I did. It does require a bit of an acquired taste since the film is very low budget, but it has some of the funniest performances I've seen in any comedy in years. Nick Turturro is a standout in this film as a pathological thief with zero self control. His brother, John, turns in a funny one as the Red-Hook-local-dance-legend, Disco Bean. It's gonna be hard going finding this movie anywhere. If this tells you anything, I got rid of all my VHS tapes years ago when DVD came out and my collection has amassed to well over 100 DVD's...but the one and only VHS tape I have to this day is "The Search for One-Eye Jimmy".

    The Search For One Eyed Jimmy was quite a strange experience. The offbeat style of this independent film is reminiscent of many from the time, however has the feel of a home made college production. And not in a good way. The movie's weak plot starts out with us meeting Les, a student filmmaker who decides to make a documentary about the oddball inhabitants of his old neighbourhood. The production soon shifts to the whereabouts of "One Eyed-Jimmy", a "bum" who we learn has been missing for a number of days. Along with the help of old friend "Joe Head" (Michael Badalucco) and sneaky reprobate Junior (Nicholas Turturro) Les sets off to make the documentary of a lifetime. The plot itself is fairly irrelevant. The film's purpose appears to be the encounters between Les & co and the town's eccentric neighbours. Filmed in 1993, obviously before a lot of these actors were famous, the film is marketed as a Steve Buscemi vehicle, despite him only getting about 15 minutes screen time. Boy how I yearned for more. Holt McCallany plays our protagonist with about as much confidence and conviction as Paris Hilton performing route canal surgery. The various cameos range from amusing (Samuel L. Jackson, playing a former army Colonel...or maybe he just thought he was) to the bizarre (Sam Rockwell, as One-Eyed Jimmy himself) to the down right equivocal (John Turturro as Disco Bean). You will be completely bewildered as to what purpose these encounters serve. Most of them aren't very funny, and seem to be prolonged. Despite it's relatively short running time of 80 minutes the film appears to have been edited by a chimp. Independently spirited, you say? Not quite. If you watch a Spike Lee or Tarantino feature like Reservoir Dogs you'll see it is edited quite impressively, and never feels like it was made for next to nothing. I can only assume that the director took a bunch of actors on a booze cruise then wondered into an open lot, nicked a bunch of cameras and decided to film this. No producer to tell them that it serves no-one but themselves. I don't mind a film being shallow, but there really is nothing to be gained from seeing this. It's not a terrible film by any means. There have been films made for a hundred times the amount of this which have stank many a cinema out. John Turturro's younger brother Nicholas is perhaps the stand out of the ensemble cast, not that it saves the film.

    I recently bought this film on DVD for &pound;1.99. Lucky for me it came with 4 other films too. I watched this first anticipating it to be the worst movie on the DVD and it did not disappoint. I must admit I am not a fan of John Turturro, Samuel L Jackson or Steve Buscemi, I generally find them annoying in films. Though they are for the most part good character actors, it is the characters they tend to play that are annoying. The film itself has a very decent cast (though mostly before the peak of their careers). However I just found the characters to be extremely dumb and uninteresting, unfunny and Irritating. It makes you wonder why the Holt McCallany character wanted to go back and make a film about the people in the place where he grew up. The film was a complete waste of time and ultimately when you finally find out what happened to Jimmy it is another letdown. Avoid this Movie at all costs it wastes a decent cast and you will never get back the time you spent watching this rubbish.

    Saw this a couple of weeks ago, my friend bought the DVD for one pound. This is overpriced for this movie. There must be a story behind the reason so many talented actors agreed to be in this, but still can't believe they did it. It is so poorly shot, the acting in general is atrocious, even from the majority of the talented guys as the dialogue is so bad. It is embarrassing to watch them put through it. If I'd made this a college, I wouldn't have expected to pass. It is really difficult to pass this by with the cast involved, but you really will regret it if you do sit and watch it.

    The long list of alternate style actors in this film- makes it the good film it is. Those non-Hollywoodized fuzzballs like Steve Buscimi's 'Ed Hoyt', John Turturro's 'Disco Bean' and Samuel L. Jackson's 'Coln. Ron' make it a simply honest film. The director Sam H. Kass bends these wacky celluloid characters just enough till the are almost real life. Of course it's the laughable situations around their searching for Jimmy Hoyt that makes it even more enjoyable. The narrative begins with a small film crew walking around filming people in a neighborhood with Michael Badalucco's 'Joe Head'- guiding the crew. Mrs Hoyt, the overly protective mom and the sister Holly (Anne Meara), are worried about alcoholic Jimmy being away for a few days. The stony-faced father in a bathrobe, Harold (Patrick McNamara), sits in the lounge- saying nothing- but his silence is understandable cause along the way- we're told he gets (not quite visible) uncontrollable erections and is depressed... So, they improvise and work around him. Going off filming, hanging out and arguing around each other- so we are always finding out interesting tidbits about these strange collection of characters. Also a plus for me, it was good to see all the Turturro family is there... bro Nicholas T. as 'Junior', sister Aida T. as 'Madame Esther', mom Katherine T. as the 'Ticket Seller #2'... and they are all superb... fitting in with the rest of the dysfunctional weirdos to make this- a comedy not to be missed.

    Badly acted, poorly shot, and no story line. Not even the various cameo's could save this dire film. Whilst it does contain a few funny moments ( most notably L.Jackson's appearance), it really is not worth the time it takes to sit through. It did strike me that perhaps it was shot during the process of making another movie, as a kind of side project,but even that would not excuse the rubbish results. I'm not usually so harsh but would hate anyone to have to sit through even ten minutes of this movie. However, to back up my claims, I know that most of the people who ignore my warning's will wish they hadn't after the first ten minutes of this nonsense.

    this movie is priceless with the classic cast of characters, one liners (the Baryshnikov of Brooklyn and other Red Hook references)and full on Brooklyn neighborhood feeling. VERY NY from the clothes, to the locals lurking in the background. Cannot get enough and it's one of those movies that the more you watch it the more you pick up on. The Turtorro family is impossible to turn away from, Paulie (tony Sirico) Walnuts, Sam Jackson, and Steve Buscemi! And this is AFTER Reservoir Dogs made him huge. Looks like they genuinely like working together as I'm sure they were paid nil to do this very low budget film. Own it, love it, spread the word, although I think it's out of print, I got my copy on ebay.

And, having watched it so many times I'm still intrigued by some of the absolutely beautiful interactions between the cast. The dialogue is superb, timing is perfect, characters are so stupidly real. Funny, pathetic, like my own friends, but from another part of the world. Highly Recommended 10/10

    Eighty minutes is way too long for "The Search For One Eyed Jimmy" , about eighty minutes too long. It's always sort of annoying when a movie has no point, looks like it was shot by a twelve year old with a camcorder running amok, and totally wastes a decent cast. The movie oozes self applause, and is nothing more than an exercise in self glorification. Do not seek out "The Search For One Eyed Jimmy" unless you are able to fast forward through the tedious and boring parts, which is essentially the entire movie. This total waste of time should be avoided at all costs. I hated "The Search For One eyed Jimmy" and believe me you will too. - MERK

    I remember aimlessly wandering Blockbuster video one night in college looking for a movie I hadn't seen yet (a rarity) and I stumbled across this movie that had a bunch of actors I liked. I rented it, watched it, and boy am I glad I did. It does require a bit of an acquired taste since the film is very low budget, but it has some of the funniest performances I've seen in any comedy in years. Nick Turturro is a standout in this film as a pathological thief with zero self control. His brother, John, turns in a funny one as the Red-Hook-local-dance-legend, Disco Bean. It's gonna be hard going finding this movie anywhere. If this tells you anything, I got rid of all my VHS tapes years ago when DVD came out and my collection has amassed to well over 100 DVD's...but the one and only VHS tape I have to this day is "The Search for One-Eye Jimmy".

    The Search For One Eyed Jimmy was quite a strange experience. The offbeat style of this independent film is reminiscent of many from the time, however has the feel of a home made college production. And not in a good way. The movie's weak plot starts out with us meeting Les, a student filmmaker who decides to make a documentary about the oddball inhabitants of his old neighbourhood. The production soon shifts to the whereabouts of "One Eyed-Jimmy", a "bum" who we learn has been missing for a number of days. Along with the help of old friend "Joe Head" (Michael Badalucco) and sneaky reprobate Junior (Nicholas Turturro) Les sets off to make the documentary of a lifetime. The plot itself is fairly irrelevant. The film's purpose appears to be the encounters between Les & co and the town's eccentric neighbours. Filmed in 1993, obviously before a lot of these actors were famous, the film is marketed as a Steve Buscemi vehicle, despite him only getting about 15 minutes screen time. Boy how I yearned for more. Holt McCallany plays our protagonist with about as much confidence and conviction as Paris Hilton performing route canal surgery. The various cameos range from amusing (Samuel L. Jackson, playing a former army Colonel...or maybe he just thought he was) to the bizarre (Sam Rockwell, as One-Eyed Jimmy himself) to the down right equivocal (John Turturro as Disco Bean). You will be completely bewildered as to what purpose these encounters serve. Most of them aren't very funny, and seem to be prolonged. Despite it's relatively short running time of 80 minutes the film appears to have been edited by a chimp. Independently spirited, you say? Not quite. If you watch a Spike Lee or Tarantino feature like Reservoir Dogs you'll see it is edited quite impressively, and never feels like it was made for next to nothing. I can only assume that the director took a bunch of actors on a booze cruise then wondered into an open lot, nicked a bunch of cameras and decided to film this. No producer to tell them that it serves no-one but themselves. I don't mind a film being shallow, but there really is nothing to be gained from seeing this. It's not a terrible film by any means. There have been films made for a hundred times the amount of this which have stank many a cinema out. John Turturro's younger brother Nicholas is perhaps the stand out of the ensemble cast, not that it saves the film.

    I recently bought this film on DVD for &pound;1.99. Lucky for me it came with 4 other films too. I watched this first anticipating it to be the worst movie on the DVD and it did not disappoint. I must admit I am not a fan of John Turturro, Samuel L Jackson or Steve Buscemi, I generally find them annoying in films. Though they are for the most part good character actors, it is the characters they tend to play that are annoying. The film itself has a very decent cast (though mostly before the peak of their careers). However I just found the characters to be extremely dumb and uninteresting, unfunny and Irritating. It makes you wonder why the Holt McCallany character wanted to go back and make a film about the people in the place where he grew up. The film was a complete waste of time and ultimately when you finally find out what happened to Jimmy it is another letdown. Avoid this Movie at all costs it wastes a decent cast and you will never get back the time you spent watching this rubbish.

    Saw this a couple of weeks ago, my friend bought the DVD for one pound. This is overpriced for this movie. There must be a story behind the reason so many talented actors agreed to be in this, but still can't believe they did it. It is so poorly shot, the acting in general is atrocious, even from the majority of the talented guys as the dialogue is so bad. It is embarrassing to watch them put through it. If I'd made this a college, I wouldn't have expected to pass. It is really difficult to pass this by with the cast involved, but you really will regret it if you do sit and watch it.

    The long list of alternate style actors in this film- makes it the good film it is. Those non-Hollywoodized fuzzballs like Steve Buscimi's 'Ed Hoyt', John Turturro's 'Disco Bean' and Samuel L. Jackson's 'Coln. Ron' make it a simply honest film. The director Sam H. Kass bends these wacky celluloid characters just enough till the are almost real life. Of course it's the laughable situations around their searching for Jimmy Hoyt that makes it even more enjoyable. The narrative begins with a small film crew walking around filming people in a neighborhood with Michael Badalucco's 'Joe Head'- guiding the crew. Mrs Hoyt, the overly protective mom and the sister Holly (Anne Meara), are worried about alcoholic Jimmy being away for a few days. The stony-faced father in a bathrobe, Harold (Patrick McNamara), sits in the lounge- saying nothing- but his silence is understandable cause along the way- we're told he gets (not quite visible) uncontrollable erections and is depressed... So, they improvise and work around him. Going off filming, hanging out and arguing around each other- so we are always finding out interesting tidbits about these strange collection of characters. Also a plus for me, it was good to see all the Turturro family is there... bro Nicholas T. as 'Junior', sister Aida T. as 'Madame Esther', mom Katherine T. as the 'Ticket Seller #2'... and they are all superb... fitting in with the rest of the dysfunctional weirdos to make this- a comedy not to be missed.

    Badly acted, poorly shot, and no story line. Not even the various cameo's could save this dire film. Whilst it does contain a few funny moments ( most notably L.Jackson's appearance), it really is not worth the time it takes to sit through. It did strike me that perhaps it was shot during the process of making another movie, as a kind of side project,but even that would not excuse the rubbish results. I'm not usually so harsh but would hate anyone to have to sit through even ten minutes of this movie. However, to back up my claims, I know that most of the people who ignore my warning's will wish they hadn't after the first ten minutes of this nonsense.

    this movie is priceless with the classic cast of characters, one liners (the Baryshnikov of Brooklyn and other Red Hook references)and full on Brooklyn neighborhood feeling. VERY NY from the clothes, to the locals lurking in the background. Cannot get enough and it's one of those movies that the more you watch it the more you pick up on. The Turtorro family is impossible to turn away from, Paulie (tony Sirico) Walnuts, Sam Jackson, and Steve Buscemi! And this is AFTER Reservoir Dogs made him huge. Looks like they genuinely like working together as I'm sure they were paid nil to do this very low budget film. Own it, love it, spread the word, although I think it's out of print, I got my copy on ebay.
