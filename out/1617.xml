    I'm generally not a fan of Robert Downey Senior's movies. His characters tend to be cartoons and his episodic style means that we seem to be watching a series of "Saturday Night" comedy sketches. "Hugo Pool" has enough great actors in it that all the usual faults are turned into virtues. It also has a sweetness and heart that I haven't seen in any other Downey film. The film is dedicated to Downey's wife and co-writer Laura Ernst. She died of the same terrible disease that the character played by Patrick Dempsey has. It is amazing how Downey shows the disease, but never lets us get sentimental over it or be afraid of it. It is just one more comic element in the film. I hope Laura coped with it as well as Patrick Dempsey's character does. The stand out performance here is by Malcolm McDowell. His portrayal of an old drug addict trying to kick the "Ding, Dang, Du" is charming and funny and sad all at once. The only unfortunate thing is that he's only on screen for about 20 minutes. I think the harsher criticisms of this film are by people who expected a more realistic, integrated film. If you willing to give Downey his quirky style, this film is sweet and delightful.

    Judging from the range of comments on Hugo Pool they seem to run the gamut. As a film, it's not the kind of thing I'd usually watch, but it did contain some rather strange characters. Alyssa Milano in between her stints as Tony Danza's daughter in Who's The Boss and one of the Halliwell sisters in Charmed was cast in the lead by director Robert Downey, Sr. She seems to have taken complete charge of the pool cleaning company that is a family business because dad (Malcolm McDowell) is reverting to being a teenager and mom (Cathy Moriarty) can't control her gambling addiction. In fact she either has to come up with the money or sleep with the bookie. Anyway somebody has to step up to the plate and Alyssa seems the only one likely to do so. She's got a lot of customers out there in Nevada who want to use their swimming pools because of the heat and who need them cleaned. Anyway on her route she meets Patrick Dempsey who even with Lou Gehrig's disease is not about to miss out on all the good things in life. In fact one of only two parts of his anatomy are untouched by amytrophic lateral sclerosis, his brain and the love muscle. In fact the second has some remarkable staying power as he informs us. Hugo Pool is the story of all these characters and the day they spend together. It's an interesting tale and maybe had it been done in a more straightforward and romantic way, I might have liked the film better. Still it's not the fault of the cast who give some very good performances. Not mentioned by me before are Robert Downey, Jr. as an egotistical movie director and Sean Penn as a hitchhiker Malcolm McDowell picks up. Dig those sky blue shoes that Penn wears. Hugo Pool might be your cup of tea, it wasn't quite mine though.

    Intentionally stupid dialogues remain stupid anyway, purposefully idiotic plot is idiotic all the same and deliberately foolish heroes stay fools all the way through. For an hour and a half we see not a single motivated action and very little of any unmotivated action too. The only credible personage is one played by somewhat balmy Sean Penn. An apotheosis of bad taste comes when a paralytic wants to take a leak, so poppa and momma prop him up while Hugo Dugay is rummaging for his pissing gimmick. Mercifully we're saved from seeing his penis but are forced to hear horrible comments about his urination anyway. Alyssa Milano, Sean Penn, Malcolm McDowell, Robert Downey Jr - what a waste of talent.

    A bit of strange and light, a bit of sad and very kind movie for those who enjoy by looking at ordinary people's life on screen. Unfortunately, my poor English doesn't let me to quote some really fun phrase from it! it's good problem-family-movie like "What's eating Gilbert Grape?", but not so radical and deep in anatomy of family separation. Main characters are honesty Hugo and her divorced parents and defenseless Floyd and careless insane Franz and unknown hitchhiker as sometimes me and maybe you, - anyone feel void from time to time and want to stop keeping themselves close to another people. Sometimes it happens.

    Some people don't get "quirky" movies. My movie friends and I loved this movie. My other friends would definitely not get it. Remember to take people's reviews with a grain of salt. After all, someone who loved Die-hard would hate this movie. Also note that most American's (and yes I am American) only like straight forward blockbuster movies. I say use you brains for once and stop making Americans the laughing stock of other countries!! This movie has a great cast. Milano and Dempsey were unknowns at that time. We watched this movie several times to catch all the things we missed the first (and second) time around. So if you're into mainstream movies this is not for you. But if you like "quirky" characters and having to think, definitely get it. (I never saw it for rent around here....)

    In "Hugo Pool" the adorable Alyssa Milano plays Hugo Dugay. A young diabetic pool cleaner who has to clean over forty pools in one day. She has some of the most eccentric David Lynch like customers, including a man (Patrick Dempsy) in a wheel chair who can only talk by a computer. Because of his kindness she can't help but fall head first, not in a pool but in love. Hugo also tries to help her crazy parents. Her father (Malcom Mcdowell) is a recovering junkie who shoots up drugs in a puppet. He calls the drug "Ring-Dang-Doo". Her mother is a compulsive gambler and owes someone money. Hugo is so kind, she even loans her mother money. "Hugo Pool" is a bizarre, colorful tragic comedy. Filled with bright blue and yellow colors throughout, it has a whacked out sense of humor that only Robert Downey Sr. could create. No wonder why his son is so crazy!

    I thought this film was quirky and well done. The Cathy Moriarty character was annoying, but the scenes with Penn and McDowell were quite funny!! Dempsey was fantastic giving his character life, and it is refreshing to see Milano in a role that is not centered around sex. * * * * S P O I L E R * * * * My favourite scene would have to be the switch between Penn and McDowell...the puppet that McDowell's character uses to inject 'the ring dan doon' and Penn's shoes. Really funny!!! If you like quirky, different movies, this one's a definite watch

    This film, concerned with the strange and unusual characters a young woman named Hugo (Alyssa Milano) meets due to her pool cleaning service actually has its moments. Malcolm McDowell, as her drug-addict recovering father and Sean Penn, as a wandering hitch-hiker he befriends frequently steal the movie with their conversations and basic musings on the real human condition. That this film actually has characters stopping,taking the time to experience the realities of life on occasion, to smell the roses so to speak, gives this an undeniably unique quality. Still many may be turned off by the artiness presented here..fans of Alyssa Milano should check this out and this is certainly above-average work from her.

    I have to admit, as I watched the movie, my expectations haven't been met. Most of all, I expected a plot. Since most movies have one, at least to some degree, the `average' watcher tends to expect one here, too. But, it didn't take me long, until I realized that this movie wasn't the `average' movie, and I don't mean that in a bad way. In the first scene where Hugo's father was introduced, I began to realize what the character of this movie is like. This perception strengthened as more and more people showed up and exhibited their unorthodox, quirky features. Alone the weird things like `a stranger is sleeping in somebody else's truck, then the owner shows up, asks no questions and they both hit the road without even wasting a thought about what this is all about' made me laugh. The dialogs between the characters and the spontaneous and almost unreasonable turns of the plot make the movie special. It is hard to explain to someone who hasn't watched it. Read the other comments and you'll find the opinions range from real bad to gorgeous. My advice is, be open-minded. This is not the average movie - in many aspects. Don't have too high expectations and you won't be disappointed, this movie is no blockbuster but it sure can be very entertaining if you give it a chance. All in all, I liked the movie and if you ask me if I'll watch it again, I'd say: no - no doubt. (6/10)

    This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years! I was so unhappy with this movie, I actually stopped watching it 30 minutes before the end... something which I almost never do! Even if this movie was free to rent, I still wouldn't rent it! It's a big waste of time, especially when there are so many other movies out there!

    Some people don't get "quirky" movies. My movie friends and I loved this movie. My other friends would definitely not get it. Remember to take people's reviews with a grain of salt. After all, someone who loved Die-hard would hate this movie. Also note that most American's (and yes I am American) only like straight forward blockbuster movies. I say use you brains for once and stop making Americans the laughing stock of other countries!! This movie has a great cast. Milano and Dempsey were unknowns at that time. We watched this movie several times to catch all the things we missed the first (and second) time around. So if you're into mainstream movies this is not for you. But if you like "quirky" characters and having to think, definitely get it. (I never saw it for rent around here....)

    In "Hugo Pool" the adorable Alyssa Milano plays Hugo Dugay. A young diabetic pool cleaner who has to clean over forty pools in one day. She has some of the most eccentric David Lynch like customers, including a man (Patrick Dempsy) in a wheel chair who can only talk by a computer. Because of his kindness she can't help but fall head first, not in a pool but in love. Hugo also tries to help her crazy parents. Her father (Malcom Mcdowell) is a recovering junkie who shoots up drugs in a puppet. He calls the drug "Ring-Dang-Doo". Her mother is a compulsive gambler and owes someone money. Hugo is so kind, she even loans her mother money. "Hugo Pool" is a bizarre, colorful tragic comedy. Filled with bright blue and yellow colors throughout, it has a whacked out sense of humor that only Robert Downey Sr. could create. No wonder why his son is so crazy!

    I thought this film was quirky and well done. The Cathy Moriarty character was annoying, but the scenes with Penn and McDowell were quite funny!! Dempsey was fantastic giving his character life, and it is refreshing to see Milano in a role that is not centered around sex. * * * * S P O I L E R * * * * My favourite scene would have to be the switch between Penn and McDowell...the puppet that McDowell's character uses to inject 'the ring dan doon' and Penn's shoes. Really funny!!! If you like quirky, different movies, this one's a definite watch

    This film, concerned with the strange and unusual characters a young woman named Hugo (Alyssa Milano) meets due to her pool cleaning service actually has its moments. Malcolm McDowell, as her drug-addict recovering father and Sean Penn, as a wandering hitch-hiker he befriends frequently steal the movie with their conversations and basic musings on the real human condition. That this film actually has characters stopping,taking the time to experience the realities of life on occasion, to smell the roses so to speak, gives this an undeniably unique quality. Still many may be turned off by the artiness presented here..fans of Alyssa Milano should check this out and this is certainly above-average work from her.

    I have to admit, as I watched the movie, my expectations haven't been met. Most of all, I expected a plot. Since most movies have one, at least to some degree, the `average' watcher tends to expect one here, too. But, it didn't take me long, until I realized that this movie wasn't the `average' movie, and I don't mean that in a bad way. In the first scene where Hugo's father was introduced, I began to realize what the character of this movie is like. This perception strengthened as more and more people showed up and exhibited their unorthodox, quirky features. Alone the weird things like `a stranger is sleeping in somebody else's truck, then the owner shows up, asks no questions and they both hit the road without even wasting a thought about what this is all about' made me laugh. The dialogs between the characters and the spontaneous and almost unreasonable turns of the plot make the movie special. It is hard to explain to someone who hasn't watched it. Read the other comments and you'll find the opinions range from real bad to gorgeous. My advice is, be open-minded. This is not the average movie - in many aspects. Don't have too high expectations and you won't be disappointed, this movie is no blockbuster but it sure can be very entertaining if you give it a chance. All in all, I liked the movie and if you ask me if I'll watch it again, I'd say: no - no doubt. (6/10)

    This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years! I was so unhappy with this movie, I actually stopped watching it 30 minutes before the end... something which I almost never do! Even if this movie was free to rent, I still wouldn't rent it! It's a big waste of time, especially when there are so many other movies out there!

    I'm generally not a fan of Robert Downey Senior's movies. His characters tend to be cartoons and his episodic style means that we seem to be watching a series of "Saturday Night" comedy sketches. "Hugo Pool" has enough great actors in it that all the usual faults are turned into virtues. It also has a sweetness and heart that I haven't seen in any other Downey film. The film is dedicated to Downey's wife and co-writer Laura Ernst. She died of the same terrible disease that the character played by Patrick Dempsey has. It is amazing how Downey shows the disease, but never lets us get sentimental over it or be afraid of it. It is just one more comic element in the film. I hope Laura coped with it as well as Patrick Dempsey's character does. The stand out performance here is by Malcolm McDowell. His portrayal of an old drug addict trying to kick the "Ding, Dang, Du" is charming and funny and sad all at once. The only unfortunate thing is that he's only on screen for about 20 minutes. I think the harsher criticisms of this film are by people who expected a more realistic, integrated film. If you willing to give Downey his quirky style, this film is sweet and delightful.

    Judging from the range of comments on Hugo Pool they seem to run the gamut. As a film, it's not the kind of thing I'd usually watch, but it did contain some rather strange characters. Alyssa Milano in between her stints as Tony Danza's daughter in Who's The Boss and one of the Halliwell sisters in Charmed was cast in the lead by director Robert Downey, Sr. She seems to have taken complete charge of the pool cleaning company that is a family business because dad (Malcolm McDowell) is reverting to being a teenager and mom (Cathy Moriarty) can't control her gambling addiction. In fact she either has to come up with the money or sleep with the bookie. Anyway somebody has to step up to the plate and Alyssa seems the only one likely to do so. She's got a lot of customers out there in Nevada who want to use their swimming pools because of the heat and who need them cleaned. Anyway on her route she meets Patrick Dempsey who even with Lou Gehrig's disease is not about to miss out on all the good things in life. In fact one of only two parts of his anatomy are untouched by amytrophic lateral sclerosis, his brain and the love muscle. In fact the second has some remarkable staying power as he informs us. Hugo Pool is the story of all these characters and the day they spend together. It's an interesting tale and maybe had it been done in a more straightforward and romantic way, I might have liked the film better. Still it's not the fault of the cast who give some very good performances. Not mentioned by me before are Robert Downey, Jr. as an egotistical movie director and Sean Penn as a hitchhiker Malcolm McDowell picks up. Dig those sky blue shoes that Penn wears. Hugo Pool might be your cup of tea, it wasn't quite mine though.

    Intentionally stupid dialogues remain stupid anyway, purposefully idiotic plot is idiotic all the same and deliberately foolish heroes stay fools all the way through. For an hour and a half we see not a single motivated action and very little of any unmotivated action too. The only credible personage is one played by somewhat balmy Sean Penn. An apotheosis of bad taste comes when a paralytic wants to take a leak, so poppa and momma prop him up while Hugo Dugay is rummaging for his pissing gimmick. Mercifully we're saved from seeing his penis but are forced to hear horrible comments about his urination anyway. Alyssa Milano, Sean Penn, Malcolm McDowell, Robert Downey Jr - what a waste of talent.

    A bit of strange and light, a bit of sad and very kind movie for those who enjoy by looking at ordinary people's life on screen. Unfortunately, my poor English doesn't let me to quote some really fun phrase from it! it's good problem-family-movie like "What's eating Gilbert Grape?", but not so radical and deep in anatomy of family separation. Main characters are honesty Hugo and her divorced parents and defenseless Floyd and careless insane Franz and unknown hitchhiker as sometimes me and maybe you, - anyone feel void from time to time and want to stop keeping themselves close to another people. Sometimes it happens.
