    This one could have had novelty value from its Sofia settings and there is a hint of the potential when Jennifer Tilly shows up as the American girl curious about the 149 political parties and a comparison with Spain after Franco. Unfortunately, her winning performance is the film's only real asset. The plot about revenging on her U.S. crime boss dad is solemn and unconvincing.
