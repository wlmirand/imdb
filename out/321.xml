    Mother (1996) A mildly amusing and warm movie about a middle-aged man who returns to his old house to live with his mom. A jealous and over-achieving brother gets in the way a little, to some light comedy, but mostly it's the growing awkward relationship of mother and son that makes the movie. In a way it is Debbie Reynolds (as the mother) and not Albert Brooks (as the main son) who dominates, and lifts it up a little. She's come a long way from the breakthrough 45 years earlier of "Singin' in the Rain" and other 1950s classics, and she still has a kind of innocent warmth on screen. In fact, you expect at first she might be a monster or a manipulator, but she's oddly straight forward and exactly the therapy the son needs. There is a lack of real conflict to the plot, however. And any butting of heads or the big twist in the story (relating to their ambitions as authors) seem contrived. An opportunity was lost (or avoided) in trying to make something gel in dramatic, human terms. But it's all in an effort for some easygoing laughs, and some irony. Faint praise here isn't mean to quite condemn the movie, but it's true, this isn't ever going to be a great one, nor a flop. It might be attractive mostly to people who like either of the main actors. There is a weird (and fun) re-writing of the Paul Simon song "Mrs. Robinson" (and sung by some very good Simon and Garfunkel imitators). Add that to the Alfa Romeo driven by Brooks, and there is a slight reference to "The Graduate" built in, though I'm not sure it really is meant to go very far. But then, nothing in this movie goes very far. Just perhaps for some far enough.

    I had heard of this movie when it came out in 1996, I heard that it was good, but never got around to seeing it. Until tonight, with my wife, on Netflix streaming movies. It is a very good movie. Written and directed by Albert Brooks, he also plays the lead role of John Henderson, Science Fiction author living in Los Angeles. He is just coming off his second divorce, and now working on his next book, but he feels "blocked." When he talks to his mother, who lives in Saucilito , he always comes away with a feeling that she doesn't really like him. So one day he decides, he doesn't ask, he will go live with his mother for an indefinite time to get sorted out. His mother is Debbie Reynolds who is just perfect in her role as Beatrice Henderson, John's mother. She is sweet but doting, as mothers often are, and their conversations seldom have a satisfying conclusion. Things are complicated by John's younger brother, Rob Morrow as Jeff , who seems to have an ideal relationship with his wife and with his mother. So John is dealing with both issues, his mother and his brother. SPOILERS: One evening when mom is out on a date John sees a box in the closet, takes it down, it is filled with notebooks of mom's writings from way before the kids came along. The stories were very good. John figured out, mom was mad because of John, when he came along she had to discontinue her writing and be a mom. But now that they both had this figured out, they could get on with their lives. And, as the movie is ending, John meets a fan, a nice single lady, and mom is at the computer, starting to write again. Her first story is about a man who moves in with his mother.

    Albert Brooks is regarded by many in the know as one of the great comics of our generation. But his style is very personal and quirky, which is why he remains a "cult comedian" even after writing, directing, and/or appearing in movies for over 20 years. (His most famous role is probably his Oscar-nominated turn in James L. Brooks's BROADCAST NEWS, where he played a brilliant reporter who failed as an on-air newscaster because he perspired "more than Nixon.") Brooks's characters tend to be anti-heroes who are so obsessed with being politically correct and "doing the right thing" that it never occurs to them how obnoxious they are. (In Brooks's REAL LIFE [1979], he played a documentary filmmaker who nearly drove his subjects to nervous breakdowns.) But in MOTHER, Brooks has made a noble effort to meet his audience more than halfway, and he's definitely worth the trouble. Brooks plays John Henderson, a science-fiction writer who begins the movie in the middle of arranging his second divorce. (Trying to look at the bright side, John says of his ex, "She brought great furniture to the marriage.") Doing some navel-gazing, John concludes that his problems with women stem from unresolved issues with his mother (Debbie Reynolds, in a welcome return to the movies). So he informs his mother that he wants to move back in with her as an "experiment." The experimental situation includes returning his old room to its 1970's splendor, complete with tacky posters and a stereo blasting at all hours of the night. John's mother has been widowed and on her own for many years, and she doesn't take kindly to the thought of re-raising her son. But she gives as good as she gets, feeding John old food from her freezer (the freezer burn, she reasons, is a "protective coating"), and informing total strangers of John's failures with women. Adding to the mix is John's brother (Rob Morrow of TV's "Northern Exposure"), who thinks Mom likes him better but is in for a few surprises. Jackie Gleason used to say that he did a "nudge act"--you could watch blustery Ralph Kramden, nudge your partner, and say, "That's my Uncle Charlie." I haven't known anyone who's seen MOTHER who didn't nudge me or anyone nearby and recognize themselves in the movie's relationships. The scene where John returns home is nothing but a prolonged take of John and his mother eating and squabbling in the kitchen, and it's probably the funniest piece of film that was shown in any theater in 1996. I hope I haven't made MOTHER sound like a dark, brooding comedy or a sappy sitcom about a grown-up kid and his mom. It's the most intelligent sort of comedy--the kind that goes for truth instead of snappy one-liners. All of the performances are believable and some kind of wonderful, and Brooks's screenplay (co-written with his long-time partner, Monica Johnson) proves that Brooks continues to be a little-known national treasure.

    Though I haven't seen all of Albert Brooks' films, this is definitely my favorite, so far. Written and directed by Brooks, he's made a movie that is relatable to just about everyone. Brooks stars as a struggling writer who, after just completing his second divorce, decides to move back home and examine his relationship with his mother (Debbie Reynolds) as an attempt to iron out his love life. The decision is met with confusion by his mother, and jealousy by his brother (the favored son, played by Rob Morrow). Anyone who's ever had a mother can appreciate the frustration Brooks encounters, whether it's his mother's penchant for nervously telling complete strangers about his troubled love life, or her indecisive driving (I can certainly relate, although mine tends toward the reckless). Their relationship is all about pushing each other's buttons; Mother as she picks apart everything in his life, and Brooks as he blames her for being the root of his lady problems. A terrific scene (one that sets the tone for all of their scenes to follow) involves Brooks being flabbergasted by his mother's food stock; the wilted lettuce in her salad, the three-year-old block of cheese, the freezer-burnt "sherbert" (housed beneath the "protective ice"). I've never met someone who can't relate to something akin to this, and it's symptomatic of a well-written "slice of life" screenplay. It also doesn't hurt that the two leads are extremely well-cast. Brooks is all about the miserable neurotic, while Reynolds embodies (with radiance) everything about the irritating mom who judges but doesn't listen. And when the two finally discover the root of their dysfunction in the film's climactic scene, it feels entirely heartfelt and not contrived. There's development to Reynolds' character; she's someone well-rounded, with hilarious results. 8/10

    I watched this movie with an open mind and I came out disappointed. I had never seen a movie try so hard to be funny and really wasn't! I sort of like Brooks but this movie I really didn't care for. Debbie Reynolds did an okay job as Mother. She was quite sexy in a "cougar-type" of way! Ha-ha So it's very believable when her son discovers she occasional meets up with a 'Charles'(Peter White) for occasional sex! Original choice Nancy Reagan would have been interesting casting. But she declined because of her husband's condition at the time. Rob Morrow is the other son. As Brook's brother they seemed to play off each other rather well. Lisa Kudrow appears for a bit as a blind date gone wrong for Brooks. John C McGinley appears also for a bit as Brook's pal trying to console him about his recent divorce. Others that were wasted were: Isabel Glasser as Morrow's wife, Vanessa Williams(Not the singer) as Kudrow's roommate. Joey Naber(Angel Town) had a nice bit as the TV delivery man as did Peter White as Reynold's "occasional" lover. The song by Simon and Garfunkel, 'Mrs. Robinson', was changed to accommodate the words and storyline of this movie by Brooks. Now called "Mrs. Henderson".

    First off, to like Albert brooks' films you have to think like a Woody Allen fan. He is exactly like Woody Allen except he came after Allen 10 or so years later. His films are "talkies" or "conversations". When I saw this back when it came out I walked out smiling. I hadn't seen it since then and so I thought I 'd revisit it and ya know what? I had the same reaction. What a wonderful little film. Basic premise is a not very successful SCI-FI writer decided he wants to go live with his mother to understand why he is the he is...and why he doesn't do well with women (he gets divorced at the beginning of the film). From there we get a jealous/needy younger brother and a look inside the inner workings of...well....moms. Why are mom's the way they are. In the end you'll get an AH HAH!!! moment when you see he figures his mom out. You'll go back in your mind and try your best to remember why your mom is, if not close, the same as Debbie Reynolds. There are so many funny moments in this film there are just too many to list. First and foremost, Albert Brooks is most certainly a writer...and a darn good one. I enjoy all his stuff like I do Woody Allen's. Walk into this and prepare to pay close attention to the dialogue and get all the little bits and pieces of ALbert Brooks mind. I'm pretty sure by the end of this one, you'll be walking away laughing and smiling one after another.

    Debbie Reynolds is terrific as the Mother who is part of Albert Brooks moving home experiment. Trying to understand his women problems leads the 40 year old, twice divorced, writer to conclude that answers lie in his old room. Though it is light weight in concept, there are many moments that anyone can easily relate to. "Mother" is not as uproariously funny as "Lost in America" or "Defending Your Life", but it is the misunderstandings between Mother and Son that eventually leads to bettering their relationship. This is one that the entire family can enjoy and relate to. ...................... Recommended - MERK

    Albert Brooks moves back in with his mother to conduct an experiment. His latest marriage is down the drain and is in the process of a divorce and he wants to figure out why his relationships with women never work out. Hence, mama, here he comes! Debbie Reynolds, who had stayed somewhat productive during her long career, but had a lull in the eighties, made her comeback in this lightweight but feel-good movie. (Due to the response to her in this movie, she was cast the following year in the Kevin Kline movie, "In and Out.") Some critics may not call "Mother" his best material, and it may not have the same reputation as other Brooks films, but this is very good, and written very true to life. (We all know or have a mother just like this.) Rob Morrow is very memorable as Albert's brother and a whiny mama's boy, who can't get through a day without talking to his mama. To me, it is one of the best family movies of the 90s, with Albert Brooks' self-deprecating humor and winning performance. Lisa Kudrow is good in a bit part near the beginning, also. To me, you can never go wrong with Albert Brooks, and with Debbie Reynolds, too, you're in for a Mother's Day treat any day of the week!

    Albert Brooks seems to have made a career out of writing, and starring in, successful small films about a man (played by Brooks) who has some self-esteem issues. By small films I mean they can be shot in any city, don't require special effects, and use very good actors but ones who are not fantastically expensive at the time of the filming. I usually find his movies enjoyable, but not "rolling in the aisles with laughter" funny. (Very few shows cause me to laugh out loud, and fewer crack me up the way some of Alec Guinness' classic comedies did.) This film is no exception. It is not the funniest or wittiest film of our time, but it is funny, witty, insightful and points out the humor of the human condition. In this case the story is about a writer (Brooks) who has recently been divorced, again, and is trying to understand why his marriages, and relationships with women in general, have been so unsuccessful. He realizes that the common factor in his marriages is that he marries women who are not supportive of him; they don't see him as a successful author. He comes up with the idea that his problem with women stem from his relationship with his mother (played delightfully by multi-talented Debbie Reynolds), who always finds fault with him but dotes on his younger brother (played by Rob Morrow), a sports agent with a wife and children. So he decides to try an experiment of moving back into his old room in his mother's house to try to learn more about why they interact the way they do. Woody Allen also writes comedies that are strong on character, but Allen seems to me to be on a higher tier, with more complex characters and deeper situations. I don't see Brooks as the West Coast Allen.

    Albert Brooks is very good here as average man, John Henderson, who in the midst of writer's block and mild mid-life crisis, decides to visit his mother in Sausalito for a few weeks and tackle his writing issues. Debbie Reynolds is very good as "Mother",quirky and set in her ways, he feels judged by her when she questions him on his failed marriage and relationships, and feels like a failure when compared to his obnoxious sports agent brother (Rob Morrow). There is much material here, as when mother is shopping at the local market and buys the cheap ice cream ("I grew up in the Depression,she says, I don't need expensive ice cream"). There is also an amusing cameo with Anne Haney as a busybody neighbor.There are several fun scenes, he visits the mall and his mother wants to buy him underwear, he picks up an adorable sharpei puppy at a pet store, and its facial expression is similar to his. Brooks' writing is understated and sardonic, which is why it works for me. Never over the top with cheap tricks, his humor is grounded in real life conflict, reminiscent of Neil Simon. Recommended.

    First off, to like Albert brooks' films you have to think like a Woody Allen fan. He is exactly like Woody Allen except he came after Allen 10 or so years later. His films are "talkies" or "conversations". When I saw this back when it came out I walked out smiling. I hadn't seen it since then and so I thought I 'd revisit it and ya know what? I had the same reaction. What a wonderful little film. Basic premise is a not very successful SCI-FI writer decided he wants to go live with his mother to understand why he is the he is...and why he doesn't do well with women (he gets divorced at the beginning of the film). From there we get a jealous/needy younger brother and a look inside the inner workings of...well....moms. Why are mom's the way they are. In the end you'll get an AH HAH!!! moment when you see he figures his mom out. You'll go back in your mind and try your best to remember why your mom is, if not close, the same as Debbie Reynolds. There are so many funny moments in this film there are just too many to list. First and foremost, Albert Brooks is most certainly a writer...and a darn good one. I enjoy all his stuff like I do Woody Allen's. Walk into this and prepare to pay close attention to the dialogue and get all the little bits and pieces of ALbert Brooks mind. I'm pretty sure by the end of this one, you'll be walking away laughing and smiling one after another.

    Debbie Reynolds is terrific as the Mother who is part of Albert Brooks moving home experiment. Trying to understand his women problems leads the 40 year old, twice divorced, writer to conclude that answers lie in his old room. Though it is light weight in concept, there are many moments that anyone can easily relate to. "Mother" is not as uproariously funny as "Lost in America" or "Defending Your Life", but it is the misunderstandings between Mother and Son that eventually leads to bettering their relationship. This is one that the entire family can enjoy and relate to. ...................... Recommended - MERK

    Albert Brooks moves back in with his mother to conduct an experiment. His latest marriage is down the drain and is in the process of a divorce and he wants to figure out why his relationships with women never work out. Hence, mama, here he comes! Debbie Reynolds, who had stayed somewhat productive during her long career, but had a lull in the eighties, made her comeback in this lightweight but feel-good movie. (Due to the response to her in this movie, she was cast the following year in the Kevin Kline movie, "In and Out.") Some critics may not call "Mother" his best material, and it may not have the same reputation as other Brooks films, but this is very good, and written very true to life. (We all know or have a mother just like this.) Rob Morrow is very memorable as Albert's brother and a whiny mama's boy, who can't get through a day without talking to his mama. To me, it is one of the best family movies of the 90s, with Albert Brooks' self-deprecating humor and winning performance. Lisa Kudrow is good in a bit part near the beginning, also. To me, you can never go wrong with Albert Brooks, and with Debbie Reynolds, too, you're in for a Mother's Day treat any day of the week!

    Albert Brooks seems to have made a career out of writing, and starring in, successful small films about a man (played by Brooks) who has some self-esteem issues. By small films I mean they can be shot in any city, don't require special effects, and use very good actors but ones who are not fantastically expensive at the time of the filming. I usually find his movies enjoyable, but not "rolling in the aisles with laughter" funny. (Very few shows cause me to laugh out loud, and fewer crack me up the way some of Alec Guinness' classic comedies did.) This film is no exception. It is not the funniest or wittiest film of our time, but it is funny, witty, insightful and points out the humor of the human condition. In this case the story is about a writer (Brooks) who has recently been divorced, again, and is trying to understand why his marriages, and relationships with women in general, have been so unsuccessful. He realizes that the common factor in his marriages is that he marries women who are not supportive of him; they don't see him as a successful author. He comes up with the idea that his problem with women stem from his relationship with his mother (played delightfully by multi-talented Debbie Reynolds), who always finds fault with him but dotes on his younger brother (played by Rob Morrow), a sports agent with a wife and children. So he decides to try an experiment of moving back into his old room in his mother's house to try to learn more about why they interact the way they do. Woody Allen also writes comedies that are strong on character, but Allen seems to me to be on a higher tier, with more complex characters and deeper situations. I don't see Brooks as the West Coast Allen.

    Albert Brooks is very good here as average man, John Henderson, who in the midst of writer's block and mild mid-life crisis, decides to visit his mother in Sausalito for a few weeks and tackle his writing issues. Debbie Reynolds is very good as "Mother",quirky and set in her ways, he feels judged by her when she questions him on his failed marriage and relationships, and feels like a failure when compared to his obnoxious sports agent brother (Rob Morrow). There is much material here, as when mother is shopping at the local market and buys the cheap ice cream ("I grew up in the Depression,she says, I don't need expensive ice cream"). There is also an amusing cameo with Anne Haney as a busybody neighbor.There are several fun scenes, he visits the mall and his mother wants to buy him underwear, he picks up an adorable sharpei puppy at a pet store, and its facial expression is similar to his. Brooks' writing is understated and sardonic, which is why it works for me. Never over the top with cheap tricks, his humor is grounded in real life conflict, reminiscent of Neil Simon. Recommended.

    Mother (1996) A mildly amusing and warm movie about a middle-aged man who returns to his old house to live with his mom. A jealous and over-achieving brother gets in the way a little, to some light comedy, but mostly it's the growing awkward relationship of mother and son that makes the movie. In a way it is Debbie Reynolds (as the mother) and not Albert Brooks (as the main son) who dominates, and lifts it up a little. She's come a long way from the breakthrough 45 years earlier of "Singin' in the Rain" and other 1950s classics, and she still has a kind of innocent warmth on screen. In fact, you expect at first she might be a monster or a manipulator, but she's oddly straight forward and exactly the therapy the son needs. There is a lack of real conflict to the plot, however. And any butting of heads or the big twist in the story (relating to their ambitions as authors) seem contrived. An opportunity was lost (or avoided) in trying to make something gel in dramatic, human terms. But it's all in an effort for some easygoing laughs, and some irony. Faint praise here isn't mean to quite condemn the movie, but it's true, this isn't ever going to be a great one, nor a flop. It might be attractive mostly to people who like either of the main actors. There is a weird (and fun) re-writing of the Paul Simon song "Mrs. Robinson" (and sung by some very good Simon and Garfunkel imitators). Add that to the Alfa Romeo driven by Brooks, and there is a slight reference to "The Graduate" built in, though I'm not sure it really is meant to go very far. But then, nothing in this movie goes very far. Just perhaps for some far enough.

    I had heard of this movie when it came out in 1996, I heard that it was good, but never got around to seeing it. Until tonight, with my wife, on Netflix streaming movies. It is a very good movie. Written and directed by Albert Brooks, he also plays the lead role of John Henderson, Science Fiction author living in Los Angeles. He is just coming off his second divorce, and now working on his next book, but he feels "blocked." When he talks to his mother, who lives in Saucilito , he always comes away with a feeling that she doesn't really like him. So one day he decides, he doesn't ask, he will go live with his mother for an indefinite time to get sorted out. His mother is Debbie Reynolds who is just perfect in her role as Beatrice Henderson, John's mother. She is sweet but doting, as mothers often are, and their conversations seldom have a satisfying conclusion. Things are complicated by John's younger brother, Rob Morrow as Jeff , who seems to have an ideal relationship with his wife and with his mother. So John is dealing with both issues, his mother and his brother. SPOILERS: One evening when mom is out on a date John sees a box in the closet, takes it down, it is filled with notebooks of mom's writings from way before the kids came along. The stories were very good. John figured out, mom was mad because of John, when he came along she had to discontinue her writing and be a mom. But now that they both had this figured out, they could get on with their lives. And, as the movie is ending, John meets a fan, a nice single lady, and mom is at the computer, starting to write again. Her first story is about a man who moves in with his mother.

    Albert Brooks is regarded by many in the know as one of the great comics of our generation. But his style is very personal and quirky, which is why he remains a "cult comedian" even after writing, directing, and/or appearing in movies for over 20 years. (His most famous role is probably his Oscar-nominated turn in James L. Brooks's BROADCAST NEWS, where he played a brilliant reporter who failed as an on-air newscaster because he perspired "more than Nixon.") Brooks's characters tend to be anti-heroes who are so obsessed with being politically correct and "doing the right thing" that it never occurs to them how obnoxious they are. (In Brooks's REAL LIFE [1979], he played a documentary filmmaker who nearly drove his subjects to nervous breakdowns.) But in MOTHER, Brooks has made a noble effort to meet his audience more than halfway, and he's definitely worth the trouble. Brooks plays John Henderson, a science-fiction writer who begins the movie in the middle of arranging his second divorce. (Trying to look at the bright side, John says of his ex, "She brought great furniture to the marriage.") Doing some navel-gazing, John concludes that his problems with women stem from unresolved issues with his mother (Debbie Reynolds, in a welcome return to the movies). So he informs his mother that he wants to move back in with her as an "experiment." The experimental situation includes returning his old room to its 1970's splendor, complete with tacky posters and a stereo blasting at all hours of the night. John's mother has been widowed and on her own for many years, and she doesn't take kindly to the thought of re-raising her son. But she gives as good as she gets, feeding John old food from her freezer (the freezer burn, she reasons, is a "protective coating"), and informing total strangers of John's failures with women. Adding to the mix is John's brother (Rob Morrow of TV's "Northern Exposure"), who thinks Mom likes him better but is in for a few surprises. Jackie Gleason used to say that he did a "nudge act"--you could watch blustery Ralph Kramden, nudge your partner, and say, "That's my Uncle Charlie." I haven't known anyone who's seen MOTHER who didn't nudge me or anyone nearby and recognize themselves in the movie's relationships. The scene where John returns home is nothing but a prolonged take of John and his mother eating and squabbling in the kitchen, and it's probably the funniest piece of film that was shown in any theater in 1996. I hope I haven't made MOTHER sound like a dark, brooding comedy or a sappy sitcom about a grown-up kid and his mom. It's the most intelligent sort of comedy--the kind that goes for truth instead of snappy one-liners. All of the performances are believable and some kind of wonderful, and Brooks's screenplay (co-written with his long-time partner, Monica Johnson) proves that Brooks continues to be a little-known national treasure.

    Though I haven't seen all of Albert Brooks' films, this is definitely my favorite, so far. Written and directed by Brooks, he's made a movie that is relatable to just about everyone. Brooks stars as a struggling writer who, after just completing his second divorce, decides to move back home and examine his relationship with his mother (Debbie Reynolds) as an attempt to iron out his love life. The decision is met with confusion by his mother, and jealousy by his brother (the favored son, played by Rob Morrow). Anyone who's ever had a mother can appreciate the frustration Brooks encounters, whether it's his mother's penchant for nervously telling complete strangers about his troubled love life, or her indecisive driving (I can certainly relate, although mine tends toward the reckless). Their relationship is all about pushing each other's buttons; Mother as she picks apart everything in his life, and Brooks as he blames her for being the root of his lady problems. A terrific scene (one that sets the tone for all of their scenes to follow) involves Brooks being flabbergasted by his mother's food stock; the wilted lettuce in her salad, the three-year-old block of cheese, the freezer-burnt "sherbert" (housed beneath the "protective ice"). I've never met someone who can't relate to something akin to this, and it's symptomatic of a well-written "slice of life" screenplay. It also doesn't hurt that the two leads are extremely well-cast. Brooks is all about the miserable neurotic, while Reynolds embodies (with radiance) everything about the irritating mom who judges but doesn't listen. And when the two finally discover the root of their dysfunction in the film's climactic scene, it feels entirely heartfelt and not contrived. There's development to Reynolds' character; she's someone well-rounded, with hilarious results. 8/10

    I watched this movie with an open mind and I came out disappointed. I had never seen a movie try so hard to be funny and really wasn't! I sort of like Brooks but this movie I really didn't care for. Debbie Reynolds did an okay job as Mother. She was quite sexy in a "cougar-type" of way! Ha-ha So it's very believable when her son discovers she occasional meets up with a 'Charles'(Peter White) for occasional sex! Original choice Nancy Reagan would have been interesting casting. But she declined because of her husband's condition at the time. Rob Morrow is the other son. As Brook's brother they seemed to play off each other rather well. Lisa Kudrow appears for a bit as a blind date gone wrong for Brooks. John C McGinley appears also for a bit as Brook's pal trying to console him about his recent divorce. Others that were wasted were: Isabel Glasser as Morrow's wife, Vanessa Williams(Not the singer) as Kudrow's roommate. Joey Naber(Angel Town) had a nice bit as the TV delivery man as did Peter White as Reynold's "occasional" lover. The song by Simon and Garfunkel, 'Mrs. Robinson', was changed to accommodate the words and storyline of this movie by Brooks. Now called "Mrs. Henderson".

Jackie Gleason used to say that he did a "nudge act"--you could watch blustery Ralph Kramden, nudge your partner, and say, "That's my Uncle Charlie." I haven't known anyone who's seen MOTHER who didn't nudge me or anyone nearby and recognize themselves in the movie's relationships. The scene where John returns home is nothing but a prolonged take of John and his mother eating and squabbling in the kitchen, and it's probably the funniest piece of film that was shown in any theater in 1996. I hope I haven't made MOTHER sound like a dark, brooding comedy or a sappy sitcom about a grown-up kid and his mom. It's the most intelligent sort of comedy--the kind that goes for truth instead of snappy one-liners. All of the performances are believable and some kind of wonderful, and Brooks's screenplay (co-written with his long-time partner, Monica Johnson) proves that Brooks continues to be a little-known national treasure.

    Though I haven't seen all of Albert Brooks' films, this is definitely my favorite, so far. Written and directed by Brooks, he's made a movie that is relatable to just about everyone. Brooks stars as a struggling writer who, after just completing his second divorce, decides to move back home and examine his relationship with his mother (Debbie Reynolds) as an attempt to iron out his love life. The decision is met with confusion by his mother, and jealousy by his brother (the favored son, played by Rob Morrow). Anyone who's ever had a mother can appreciate the frustration Brooks encounters, whether it's his mother's penchant for nervously telling complete strangers about his troubled love life, or her indecisive driving (I can certainly relate, although mine tends toward the reckless). Their relationship is all about pushing each other's buttons; Mother as she picks apart everything in his life, and Brooks as he blames her for being the root of his lady problems. A terrific scene (one that sets the tone for all of their scenes to follow) involves Brooks being flabbergasted by his mother's food stock; the wilted lettuce in her salad, the three-year-old block of cheese, the freezer-burnt "sherbert" (housed beneath the "protective ice"). I've never met someone who can't relate to something akin to this, and it's symptomatic of a well-written "slice of life" screenplay. It also doesn't hurt that the two leads are extremely well-cast. Brooks is all about the miserable neurotic, while Reynolds embodies (with radiance) everything about the irritating mom who judges but doesn't listen. And when the two finally discover the root of their dysfunction in the film's climactic scene, it feels entirely heartfelt and not contrived. There's development to Reynolds' character; she's someone well-rounded, with hilarious results. 8/10

    I watched this movie with an open mind and I came out disappointed. I had never seen a movie try so hard to be funny and really wasn't! I sort of like Brooks but this movie I really didn't care for. Debbie Reynolds did an okay job as Mother. She was quite sexy in a "cougar-type" of way! Ha-ha So it's very believable when her son discovers she occasional meets up with a 'Charles'(Peter White) for occasional sex! Original choice Nancy Reagan would have been interesting casting. But she declined because of her husband's condition at the time. Rob Morrow is the other son. As Brook's brother they seemed to play off each other rather well. Lisa Kudrow appears for a bit as a blind date gone wrong for Brooks. John C McGinley appears also for a bit as Brook's pal trying to console him about his recent divorce. Others that were wasted were: Isabel Glasser as Morrow's wife, Vanessa Williams(Not the singer) as Kudrow's roommate. Joey Naber(Angel Town) had a nice bit as the TV delivery man as did Peter White as Reynold's "occasional" lover. The song by Simon and Garfunkel, 'Mrs. Robinson', was changed to accommodate the words and storyline of this movie by Brooks. Now called "Mrs. Henderson".

    First off, to like Albert brooks' films you have to think like a Woody Allen fan. He is exactly like Woody Allen except he came after Allen 10 or so years later. His films are "talkies" or "conversations". When I saw this back when it came out I walked out smiling. I hadn't seen it since then and so I thought I 'd revisit it and ya know what? I had the same reaction. What a wonderful little film. Basic premise is a not very successful SCI-FI writer decided he wants to go live with his mother to understand why he is the he is...and why he doesn't do well with women (he gets divorced at the beginning of the film). From there we get a jealous/needy younger brother and a look inside the inner workings of...well....moms. Why are mom's the way they are. In the end you'll get an AH HAH!!! moment when you see he figures his mom out. You'll go back in your mind and try your best to remember why your mom is, if not close, the same as Debbie Reynolds. There are so many funny moments in this film there are just too many to list. First and foremost, Albert Brooks is most certainly a writer...and a darn good one. I enjoy all his stuff like I do Woody Allen's. Walk into this and prepare to pay close attention to the dialogue and get all the little bits and pieces of ALbert Brooks mind. I'm pretty sure by the end of this one, you'll be walking away laughing and smiling one after another.

    Debbie Reynolds is terrific as the Mother who is part of Albert Brooks moving home experiment. Trying to understand his women problems leads the 40 year old, twice divorced, writer to conclude that answers lie in his old room. Though it is light weight in concept, there are many moments that anyone can easily relate to. "Mother" is not as uproariously funny as "Lost in America" or "Defending Your Life", but it is the misunderstandings between Mother and Son that eventually leads to bettering their relationship. This is one that the entire family can enjoy and relate to. ...................... Recommended - MERK

    Albert Brooks moves back in with his mother to conduct an experiment. His latest marriage is down the drain and is in the process of a divorce and he wants to figure out why his relationships with women never work out. Hence, mama, here he comes! Debbie Reynolds, who had stayed somewhat productive during her long career, but had a lull in the eighties, made her comeback in this lightweight but feel-good movie. (Due to the response to her in this movie, she was cast the following year in the Kevin Kline movie, "In and Out.") Some critics may not call "Mother" his best material, and it may not have the same reputation as other Brooks films, but this is very good, and written very true to life. (We all know or have a mother just like this.) Rob Morrow is very memorable as Albert's brother and a whiny mama's boy, who can't get through a day without talking to his mama. To me, it is one of the best family movies of the 90s, with Albert Brooks' self-deprecating humor and winning performance. Lisa Kudrow is good in a bit part near the beginning, also. To me, you can never go wrong with Albert Brooks, and with Debbie Reynolds, too, you're in for a Mother's Day treat any day of the week!

    Albert Brooks seems to have made a career out of writing, and starring in, successful small films about a man (played by Brooks) who has some self-esteem issues. By small films I mean they can be shot in any city, don't require special effects, and use very good actors but ones who are not fantastically expensive at the time of the filming. I usually find his movies enjoyable, but not "rolling in the aisles with laughter" funny. (Very few shows cause me to laugh out loud, and fewer crack me up the way some of Alec Guinness' classic comedies did.) This film is no exception. It is not the funniest or wittiest film of our time, but it is funny, witty, insightful and points out the humor of the human condition. In this case the story is about a writer (Brooks) who has recently been divorced, again, and is trying to understand why his marriages, and relationships with women in general, have been so unsuccessful. He realizes that the common factor in his marriages is that he marries women who are not supportive of him; they don't see him as a successful author. He comes up with the idea that his problem with women stem from his relationship with his mother (played delightfully by multi-talented Debbie Reynolds), who always finds fault with him but dotes on his younger brother (played by Rob Morrow), a sports agent with a wife and children. So he decides to try an experiment of moving back into his old room in his mother's house to try to learn more about why they interact the way they do. Woody Allen also writes comedies that are strong on character, but Allen seems to me to be on a higher tier, with more complex characters and deeper situations. I don't see Brooks as the West Coast Allen.

    Albert Brooks is very good here as average man, John Henderson, who in the midst of writer's block and mild mid-life crisis, decides to visit his mother in Sausalito for a few weeks and tackle his writing issues. Debbie Reynolds is very good as "Mother",quirky and set in her ways, he feels judged by her when she questions him on his failed marriage and relationships, and feels like a failure when compared to his obnoxious sports agent brother (Rob Morrow). There is much material here, as when mother is shopping at the local market and buys the cheap ice cream ("I grew up in the Depression,she says, I don't need expensive ice cream"). There is also an amusing cameo with Anne Haney as a busybody neighbor.There are several fun scenes, he visits the mall and his mother wants to buy him underwear, he picks up an adorable sharpei puppy at a pet store, and its facial expression is similar to his. Brooks' writing is understated and sardonic, which is why it works for me. Never over the top with cheap tricks, his humor is grounded in real life conflict, reminiscent of Neil Simon. Recommended.

    Mother (1996) A mildly amusing and warm movie about a middle-aged man who returns to his old house to live with his mom. A jealous and over-achieving brother gets in the way a little, to some light comedy, but mostly it's the growing awkward relationship of mother and son that makes the movie. In a way it is Debbie Reynolds (as the mother) and not Albert Brooks (as the main son) who dominates, and lifts it up a little. She's come a long way from the breakthrough 45 years earlier of "Singin' in the Rain" and other 1950s classics, and she still has a kind of innocent warmth on screen. In fact, you expect at first she might be a monster or a manipulator, but she's oddly straight forward and exactly the therapy the son needs. There is a lack of real conflict to the plot, however. And any butting of heads or the big twist in the story (relating to their ambitions as authors) seem contrived. An opportunity was lost (or avoided) in trying to make something gel in dramatic, human terms. But it's all in an effort for some easygoing laughs, and some irony. Faint praise here isn't mean to quite condemn the movie, but it's true, this isn't ever going to be a great one, nor a flop. It might be attractive mostly to people who like either of the main actors. There is a weird (and fun) re-writing of the Paul Simon song "Mrs. Robinson" (and sung by some very good Simon and Garfunkel imitators). Add that to the Alfa Romeo driven by Brooks, and there is a slight reference to "The Graduate" built in, though I'm not sure it really is meant to go very far. But then, nothing in this movie goes very far. Just perhaps for some far enough.

    I had heard of this movie when it came out in 1996, I heard that it was good, but never got around to seeing it. Until tonight, with my wife, on Netflix streaming movies. It is a very good movie. Written and directed by Albert Brooks, he also plays the lead role of John Henderson, Science Fiction author living in Los Angeles. He is just coming off his second divorce, and now working on his next book, but he feels "blocked." When he talks to his mother, who lives in Saucilito , he always comes away with a feeling that she doesn't really like him. So one day he decides, he doesn't ask, he will go live with his mother for an indefinite time to get sorted out. His mother is Debbie Reynolds who is just perfect in her role as Beatrice Henderson, John's mother. She is sweet but doting, as mothers often are, and their conversations seldom have a satisfying conclusion. Things are complicated by John's younger brother, Rob Morrow as Jeff , who seems to have an ideal relationship with his wife and with his mother. So John is dealing with both issues, his mother and his brother. SPOILERS: One evening when mom is out on a date John sees a box in the closet, takes it down, it is filled with notebooks of mom's writings from way before the kids came along. The stories were very good. John figured out, mom was mad because of John, when he came along she had to discontinue her writing and be a mom. But now that they both had this figured out, they could get on with their lives. And, as the movie is ending, John meets a fan, a nice single lady, and mom is at the computer, starting to write again. Her first story is about a man who moves in with his mother.

    Albert Brooks is regarded by many in the know as one of the great comics of our generation. But his style is very personal and quirky, which is why he remains a "cult comedian" even after writing, directing, and/or appearing in movies for over 20 years. (His most famous role is probably his Oscar-nominated turn in James L. Brooks's BROADCAST NEWS, where he played a brilliant reporter who failed as an on-air newscaster because he perspired "more than Nixon.") Brooks's characters tend to be anti-heroes who are so obsessed with being politically correct and "doing the right thing" that it never occurs to them how obnoxious they are. (In Brooks's REAL LIFE [1979], he played a documentary filmmaker who nearly drove his subjects to nervous breakdowns.) But in MOTHER, Brooks has made a noble effort to meet his audience more than halfway, and he's definitely worth the trouble. Brooks plays John Henderson, a science-fiction writer who begins the movie in the middle of arranging his second divorce. (Trying to look at the bright side, John says of his ex, "She brought great furniture to the marriage.") Doing some navel-gazing, John concludes that his problems with women stem from unresolved issues with his mother (Debbie Reynolds, in a welcome return to the movies). So he informs his mother that he wants to move back in with her as an "experiment." The experimental situation includes returning his old room to its 1970's splendor, complete with tacky posters and a stereo blasting at all hours of the night. John's mother has been widowed and on her own for many years, and she doesn't take kindly to the thought of re-raising her son. But she gives as good as she gets, feeding John old food from her freezer (the freezer burn, she reasons, is a "protective coating"), and informing total strangers of John's failures with women. Adding to the mix is John's brother (Rob Morrow of TV's "Northern Exposure"), who thinks Mom likes him better but is in for a few surprises. Jackie Gleason used to say that he did a "nudge act"--you could watch blustery Ralph Kramden, nudge your partner, and say, "That's my Uncle Charlie." I haven't known anyone who's seen MOTHER who didn't nudge me or anyone nearby and recognize themselves in the movie's relationships. The scene where John returns home is nothing but a prolonged take of John and his mother eating and squabbling in the kitchen, and it's probably the funniest piece of film that was shown in any theater in 1996. I hope I haven't made MOTHER sound like a dark, brooding comedy or a sappy sitcom about a grown-up kid and his mom. It's the most intelligent sort of comedy--the kind that goes for truth instead of snappy one-liners. All of the performances are believable and some kind of wonderful, and Brooks's screenplay (co-written with his long-time partner, Monica Johnson) proves that Brooks continues to be a little-known national treasure.
