  Two Western bank/train robbers flee to Bolivia when the law gets too close.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Butch and Sundance are the two leaders of the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. Butch is all ideas, Sundance is all action and skill.

    Paul Newman & Robert Redford play Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid in director George Roy Hill's take on the historical pair of western outlaws who amiably(!) rob banks and trains with their hole-in-the-wall-gang, who soon find themselves wanted men who must flee across the west, taking refuge where they can, and especially with their lady friend Etta Place(Katherine Ross) before they make that fateful trip to Bolivia... Though Paul Newman & Robert Redford are undeniably appealing as the title characters, and the hit song, "Raindrops keep falling on my head" is wonderful, film itself is far too protracted and tedious to succeed; it just didn't hold my interest, though both "Unsolved Mysteries" & "In Search Of..." did excellent jobs focusing on Butch, and whether or not he survived that Bolivian gunfight(no word on Sundance). I'd much rather watch those accounts than this film...

    This film is far from your usual Western, unlike the works of Leone and Ford this films takes a different approach to the genre under the direction of George Roy Hill, it is a feel good, enjoyable film made that way by focusing on the lovable relationship between its two lead stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford. The two play a pair of infamous train robbers, the leading men of the 'Hole in the Wall gang' with the history of the duo shown in an enjoyable silent film as the film opens. In fact the duo have become so good at what they do that E. H. Harriman hires a 'supper-posse' to track them down due to the costs they are causing his rail company from their robberies. The first half of the film focused on introducing us to the two characters whose dialogue allows for some humorous and enjoyable moments, we see Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy ride around in his new bicycle to the tune of 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' in one of the film's most memorable scenes. From about the half way point the story completely changes, the plot that we have been given now becomes less focused on what is happening and more focused on the relationship setup between the three main characters (the third is Sundance's lover Katherine Ross ) as we have to endure what feels like a never ending chase between the lead duo and the posse. From a production viewpoint I can understand the complaints about the film, with the middle ending in particular seemed to be exaggerated as much as possible, the focus on this could have been used elsewhere with a stronger plot to make this film truly great. The film's downsides thankfully don't decrease our enjoyment for our film that much, the relationship of Newman and Redford dominates the film, once they get hired to transport money working in Bolivia we once again get to see their chemistry and great dialogue at the strongest with some great scenes again. The film won Academy Awards for its song and score but also for best original screenplay and cinematography, these are two of the film's strengths Â– the screenplay has some of the most memorable and funniest quotes between Newman and Redford and the cinematography creates some beautiful landscapes for us to enjoy in the scenes such as the posse chase and the rural terrain in Bolivia. And although the ending has been criticised I feel it sums up the film perfectly, we see the duo in an extremely difficult situation and the two exchange conversation with such brilliant and humorous dialogue -"For a moment there I thought we were in trouble". "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is one of the most unique Western films that there is, and it is one I would definitely recommend watching to fans both of the genre, it is definitely one of the most likable and enjoyable films of its kind despite its flaws.

    George Roy Hill directs one of the great westerns of the 1960s that didn't star John Wayne or Lee Van Cleef. "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" stars Robert Redford and Paul Newman, and the film made them icons and sex idols instantly. This film was very popular among movie-goers, that it gave rise to a whole new generation of American western films in the 1970s and 1980s. The soundtrack to the film is just as amazing as the film itself, with 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' sticking out. Also, the last scene in the film, which was set in Bolivia has stirred more interest in Butch and Sundance since the film was released in 1969. Robert Redford even used his character Sundance in the film, as the name of his film festival, which is recognized worldwide. The American conscience, without this film would be quite different.

    "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" tells the mostly true story of a pair of notorious outlaws on the lam. The film won four Oscars and is now regarded as a cinema classic. However, for me, it took a few viewings before I really warmed up to it. The movie is anything but a typical western. For one thing, part of the story takes place in Bolivia, of all locations. There's also more comedy than is usual for a western. Lastly, the Burt Bacharach score defies convention. Some of these quirks set the film apart in a good way while the effect of others is debatable. Personally, I feel that the script struggles a bit with tone and I also find that Bacharach's music is ill-suited for a western. However, it's tough to fault the actors. Newman and Redford have good chemistry together, making this a touchstone for countless buddy comedies to come. Katharine Ross has a more limited role but she performs well nonetheless. There are also some memorable performances in smaller roles, including Strother Martin as a 'colourful' mining company employee. I'm not a big fan of William Goldman's script, despite the fact that it won an Oscar. There are indeed some memorable scenes and dialogue but there's also some material that isn't particularly memorable. The script is also a bit too jokey to be taken very seriously when it tries to be serious. That being said, the climactic showdown does show a deft combination of action, humour & drama. As for the direction, George Roy Hill's Oscar-nominated work is indeed above average. However, I find Conrad Hall's cinematography to be hit or miss. At times, he & Hill went for (and achieved) a washed out look which I didn't care for at all. The Burt Bacharach score, which won an Oscar (plus another for the song "Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head"), doesn't particularly appeal to me either. Perhaps it's the juxtaposition of then-contemporary music with the western background that is unpalatable to me. Nevertheless, despite these complaints the film is still enjoyable. It's undeniably required viewing for movie buffs, though I would caution that the merits of its eccentricities are open to debate.

    My first western, it turns out, was more of a buddy movie described by another as a "Beatles movie in Bonnie and Clyde clothes". Our thieves carry on as the cocky folk heroes they became, full of confidence until doggedly chased by an unrelenting posse. Their journey is full of clever, but honest, dialog and their running from the law through nature's open and awesome backdrop is quite an awe inspiring site. Butch and Sundance mostly share their knowledge to try to figure out, "who are those guys?", to no avail. The movie would have been fine without the BJ Thomas hit, may have a plot full of movie inevitability but still has a style full of campfire camaraderie.

    I found this movie fairly entertaining for a western-type film. I appreciated the sarcastic humor that was spread throughout it. The montages were kinda upbeat and nice. The music wasn't typical for a western and I liked that. The "old" photos used to show passed time were neat. I found myself going back and forth between liking Butch and Cassidy and disliking them. Their friendship was adorable and how they bickered back and forth. But shooting people and being robbers, not so much. So I would go from laughing at their antics to then feeling sorry for the others involved. I thought the final scene was great, just those last few minutes... it was directed in a nice way to end the storyline.

    Butch Cassidy went to town at the 1969 academy awards, taking home four trophies and losing out to Jon Voight's 'Midnight Cowboy'. It still received the most awards for the year, but unfortunately, there was no Oscar Nomination for Paul Newman or Robert Redford. Butch Cassidy is one of the all-time greatest westerns, and is a fantastic character study based on the true events of two outlaws/train-robbers/bank-robbers. The film opens with an old fashioned film reel, projected in a small square on the screen which depicts the events which the film is based on. The images depicted are left open to interpretation of whether they are real footage or not, and that is all part of the fun. Once the credits have rolled, and the old-fashioned footage is over, it pans out to a full-size image. The colour in this sequence is spectacularly chosen, an old-fashioned, and not quite black and white set of scenes introducing our two title characters. Paul Newman is Butch Cassidy, the man who Sundance states is 'All-Talk'. He walks along and ponders the question "What happened to the old bank, it was beautiful?". He is told that it had to be closed down due to the fact that it was getting robbed to often. He shows that cheeky smile, a trademark of his throughout the film and replies "Ah Well. A Small Price to Pay for Beauty". Then we encounter the Sundance Kid, still in the old-fashioned colour sequence, playing cards with two men (one of them is a not-so-obvious Sam Elliot). After a bit of a winning streak, one of the men accuses Sundance of cheating. He stands up in an attempt to intimidate him, prepared to draw upon his gun as he tells him to leave the chips on the table and get out. Upon the discovery that he was playing against 'The Sundance Kid' he says "I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating. If I draw on you, you'll kill me". Sundance stands and in his soft yet tough guy voice replies "There is that possibility". Throughout the film, he proceeds to show his skills with a gun and how he lives up to his reputation, even after Butch Cassidy jokes "You never could shoot". Although the violence in this film is kept to a minimum, it is used to a good effect. No shock values, its all clean, and most of the time with a sprinkle of humour. The dialogue in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is fast and snappy. The screenplay was constructed with such elegance, creating a combination of funny and emotionally enduring dialogue. The film's cinematography is also great, differing between the different colours on screen, the old fashioned photograph montage, etc. Its put together really effectively. Some scenes may seem to drag out for a while to some viewers. A sequence where Butch and Sundance are being traced by trackers, which was intended to create tension and excitement by stringing it out for as long as possible. Its not a complaint, but it just seemed like Director, Hill, was holding back to try and keep in compliance with real events. Having said this, the scene described above does end with the fantastic and well-known sequence where Paul Newman and Redford jump off the cliff to escape the trackers. The dialogue in that scene is rich, "I can't swim", "Ah, don't worry about that, the fall will probably kill ya." The performances by Newman and Redford are note-perfect in this film, and it really seemed to set up the basis for their film relationship, which led towards the 1973 classic 'The Sting'. Its kind of like Brad Pitt and George Clooney, in a way, I wonder if they have considered remaking this film with themselves as the title characters?... Brad Pitt does resemble a young Robert Redford. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an absolute classic <8 out 10> A great character study with great performances from Newman and Redford.

    *Spoiler/plot- Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1969. When two bungling bank and train robbers tire of running from the law, they set out for Boliva with Sundance's girlfriend. Though they can barely speak enough Spanish to communicate 'This is a stick-up" that's only a minor detail to the nicest 'bad guys' who ever rode the West. *Special Stars- Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Catherince Ross, Trevor Martin. *Theme- Eveen if you're nice to be around but an outlaw, the law will catch-up with your lawlessness. *Trivia/location/goofs- Oscar winner 1969: best story & screenplay and Cinematography. Lead roles try-outs: Jack Lemon, Steve Mcqueen, Marlon Brando, and Warren Beatty. The final decision changed after Redford wanted the Butch role and Newman the Sundance role. *Emotion- A thoroughly enjoyable buddy film (+girlfriend) with excellent writing, casting and production values. This fine script took two obscure and little known Western characters and made them a house-hold word. A fine example of Hollywood's best achievement and a real treat for anyone watching this film. BTW: Be sure to see the who uncut version, because those reduced and edited TV or Cable versions does not give you the director's story on these characters.

    From the corny acting and one-liners (maybe 3 were funny?) to the incessant passing around of the girlfriend (I still can't assess who's girl it was) to the shrill music and long-ass pictures to substitute for acting, I thought it stunk. Heard so many good things about this, and I can handle a slow western (Outlaw Josey Wales). But this was something else. I only finished it on principle. Took me two days. Had to mute the Bolivian scenes, the music was so obnoxious, by God. Don't get the love for this weak, mediocre film. You could have accomplished the same thing, but in better fashion, with Young Guns II. Certainly has more heart, that's for sure. Give me True Grit or Josey Wales any day... ...this blows.

    real beautiful. for wise doses of humor and drama, for extraordinary performance, for few great scenes - bike wheel rotating in water, the plains and mountains, the posse as line of ambiguous menace. it is a mart film. than, a perfect story in the atmosphere of a world with nuances of magic. sepia photos solution, the charm of performance - like summer fruits in afternoon, the joy to do central characters. the feelings as puzzle and delicate nuances of love story. extraordinary dialogs. and the frame of entire movie like role of each viewer as part of film. so, it is little more than classic. it is always fresh and seductive. and, not less, smart work in which line between fiction and real facts is only convention. a story. in manner of Arabian Nights. only the place is different. but each space has its Scheherazade. in this case, respectable mister George Roy Hill.

Having said this, the scene described above does end with the fantastic and well-known sequence where Paul Newman and Redford jump off the cliff to escape the trackers. The dialogue in that scene is rich, "I can't swim", "Ah, don't worry about that, the fall will probably kill ya." The performances by Newman and Redford are note-perfect in this film, and it really seemed to set up the basis for their film relationship, which led towards the 1973 classic 'The Sting'. Its kind of like Brad Pitt and George Clooney, in a way, I wonder if they have considered remaking this film with themselves as the title characters?... Brad Pitt does resemble a young Robert Redford. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an absolute classic <8 out 10> A great character study with great performances from Newman and Redford.

    *Spoiler/plot- Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1969. When two bungling bank and train robbers tire of running from the law, they set out for Boliva with Sundance's girlfriend. Though they can barely speak enough Spanish to communicate 'This is a stick-up" that's only a minor detail to the nicest 'bad guys' who ever rode the West. *Special Stars- Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Catherince Ross, Trevor Martin. *Theme- Eveen if you're nice to be around but an outlaw, the law will catch-up with your lawlessness. *Trivia/location/goofs- Oscar winner 1969: best story & screenplay and Cinematography. Lead roles try-outs: Jack Lemon, Steve Mcqueen, Marlon Brando, and Warren Beatty. The final decision changed after Redford wanted the Butch role and Newman the Sundance role. *Emotion- A thoroughly enjoyable buddy film (+girlfriend) with excellent writing, casting and production values. This fine script took two obscure and little known Western characters and made them a house-hold word. A fine example of Hollywood's best achievement and a real treat for anyone watching this film. BTW: Be sure to see the who uncut version, because those reduced and edited TV or Cable versions does not give you the director's story on these characters.

    From the corny acting and one-liners (maybe 3 were funny?) to the incessant passing around of the girlfriend (I still can't assess who's girl it was) to the shrill music and long-ass pictures to substitute for acting, I thought it stunk. Heard so many good things about this, and I can handle a slow western (Outlaw Josey Wales). But this was something else. I only finished it on principle. Took me two days. Had to mute the Bolivian scenes, the music was so obnoxious, by God. Don't get the love for this weak, mediocre film. You could have accomplished the same thing, but in better fashion, with Young Guns II. Certainly has more heart, that's for sure. Give me True Grit or Josey Wales any day... ...this blows.

    Paul Newman & Robert Redford play Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid in director George Roy Hill's take on the historical pair of western outlaws who amiably(!) rob banks and trains with their hole-in-the-wall-gang, who soon find themselves wanted men who must flee across the west, taking refuge where they can, and especially with their lady friend Etta Place(Katherine Ross) before they make that fateful trip to Bolivia... Though Paul Newman & Robert Redford are undeniably appealing as the title characters, and the hit song, "Raindrops keep falling on my head" is wonderful, film itself is far too protracted and tedious to succeed; it just didn't hold my interest, though both "Unsolved Mysteries" & "In Search Of..." did excellent jobs focusing on Butch, and whether or not he survived that Bolivian gunfight(no word on Sundance). I'd much rather watch those accounts than this film...

    This film is far from your usual Western, unlike the works of Leone and Ford this films takes a different approach to the genre under the direction of George Roy Hill, it is a feel good, enjoyable film made that way by focusing on the lovable relationship between its two lead stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford. The two play a pair of infamous train robbers, the leading men of the 'Hole in the Wall gang' with the history of the duo shown in an enjoyable silent film as the film opens. In fact the duo have become so good at what they do that E. H. Harriman hires a 'supper-posse' to track them down due to the costs they are causing his rail company from their robberies. The first half of the film focused on introducing us to the two characters whose dialogue allows for some humorous and enjoyable moments, we see Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy ride around in his new bicycle to the tune of 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' in one of the film's most memorable scenes. From about the half way point the story completely changes, the plot that we have been given now becomes less focused on what is happening and more focused on the relationship setup between the three main characters (the third is Sundance's lover Katherine Ross ) as we have to endure what feels like a never ending chase between the lead duo and the posse. From a production viewpoint I can understand the complaints about the film, with the middle ending in particular seemed to be exaggerated as much as possible, the focus on this could have been used elsewhere with a stronger plot to make this film truly great. The film's downsides thankfully don't decrease our enjoyment for our film that much, the relationship of Newman and Redford dominates the film, once they get hired to transport money working in Bolivia we once again get to see their chemistry and great dialogue at the strongest with some great scenes again. The film won Academy Awards for its song and score but also for best original screenplay and cinematography, these are two of the film's strengths Â– the screenplay has some of the most memorable and funniest quotes between Newman and Redford and the cinematography creates some beautiful landscapes for us to enjoy in the scenes such as the posse chase and the rural terrain in Bolivia. And although the ending has been criticised I feel it sums up the film perfectly, we see the duo in an extremely difficult situation and the two exchange conversation with such brilliant and humorous dialogue -"For a moment there I thought we were in trouble". "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is one of the most unique Western films that there is, and it is one I would definitely recommend watching to fans both of the genre, it is definitely one of the most likable and enjoyable films of its kind despite its flaws.

    George Roy Hill directs one of the great westerns of the 1960s that didn't star John Wayne or Lee Van Cleef. "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" stars Robert Redford and Paul Newman, and the film made them icons and sex idols instantly. This film was very popular among movie-goers, that it gave rise to a whole new generation of American western films in the 1970s and 1980s. The soundtrack to the film is just as amazing as the film itself, with 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' sticking out. Also, the last scene in the film, which was set in Bolivia has stirred more interest in Butch and Sundance since the film was released in 1969. Robert Redford even used his character Sundance in the film, as the name of his film festival, which is recognized worldwide. The American conscience, without this film would be quite different.

    "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" tells the mostly true story of a pair of notorious outlaws on the lam. The film won four Oscars and is now regarded as a cinema classic. However, for me, it took a few viewings before I really warmed up to it. The movie is anything but a typical western. For one thing, part of the story takes place in Bolivia, of all locations. There's also more comedy than is usual for a western. Lastly, the Burt Bacharach score defies convention. Some of these quirks set the film apart in a good way while the effect of others is debatable. Personally, I feel that the script struggles a bit with tone and I also find that Bacharach's music is ill-suited for a western. However, it's tough to fault the actors. Newman and Redford have good chemistry together, making this a touchstone for countless buddy comedies to come. Katharine Ross has a more limited role but she performs well nonetheless. There are also some memorable performances in smaller roles, including Strother Martin as a 'colourful' mining company employee. I'm not a big fan of William Goldman's script, despite the fact that it won an Oscar. There are indeed some memorable scenes and dialogue but there's also some material that isn't particularly memorable. The script is also a bit too jokey to be taken very seriously when it tries to be serious. That being said, the climactic showdown does show a deft combination of action, humour & drama. As for the direction, George Roy Hill's Oscar-nominated work is indeed above average. However, I find Conrad Hall's cinematography to be hit or miss. At times, he & Hill went for (and achieved) a washed out look which I didn't care for at all. The Burt Bacharach score, which won an Oscar (plus another for the song "Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head"), doesn't particularly appeal to me either. Perhaps it's the juxtaposition of then-contemporary music with the western background that is unpalatable to me. Nevertheless, despite these complaints the film is still enjoyable. It's undeniably required viewing for movie buffs, though I would caution that the merits of its eccentricities are open to debate.

    My first western, it turns out, was more of a buddy movie described by another as a "Beatles movie in Bonnie and Clyde clothes". Our thieves carry on as the cocky folk heroes they became, full of confidence until doggedly chased by an unrelenting posse. Their journey is full of clever, but honest, dialog and their running from the law through nature's open and awesome backdrop is quite an awe inspiring site. Butch and Sundance mostly share their knowledge to try to figure out, "who are those guys?", to no avail. The movie would have been fine without the BJ Thomas hit, may have a plot full of movie inevitability but still has a style full of campfire camaraderie.

    I found this movie fairly entertaining for a western-type film. I appreciated the sarcastic humor that was spread throughout it. The montages were kinda upbeat and nice. The music wasn't typical for a western and I liked that. The "old" photos used to show passed time were neat. I found myself going back and forth between liking Butch and Cassidy and disliking them. Their friendship was adorable and how they bickered back and forth. But shooting people and being robbers, not so much. So I would go from laughing at their antics to then feeling sorry for the others involved. I thought the final scene was great, just those last few minutes... it was directed in a nice way to end the storyline.

    Butch Cassidy went to town at the 1969 academy awards, taking home four trophies and losing out to Jon Voight's 'Midnight Cowboy'. It still received the most awards for the year, but unfortunately, there was no Oscar Nomination for Paul Newman or Robert Redford. Butch Cassidy is one of the all-time greatest westerns, and is a fantastic character study based on the true events of two outlaws/train-robbers/bank-robbers. The film opens with an old fashioned film reel, projected in a small square on the screen which depicts the events which the film is based on. The images depicted are left open to interpretation of whether they are real footage or not, and that is all part of the fun. Once the credits have rolled, and the old-fashioned footage is over, it pans out to a full-size image. The colour in this sequence is spectacularly chosen, an old-fashioned, and not quite black and white set of scenes introducing our two title characters. Paul Newman is Butch Cassidy, the man who Sundance states is 'All-Talk'. He walks along and ponders the question "What happened to the old bank, it was beautiful?". He is told that it had to be closed down due to the fact that it was getting robbed to often. He shows that cheeky smile, a trademark of his throughout the film and replies "Ah Well. A Small Price to Pay for Beauty". Then we encounter the Sundance Kid, still in the old-fashioned colour sequence, playing cards with two men (one of them is a not-so-obvious Sam Elliot). After a bit of a winning streak, one of the men accuses Sundance of cheating. He stands up in an attempt to intimidate him, prepared to draw upon his gun as he tells him to leave the chips on the table and get out. Upon the discovery that he was playing against 'The Sundance Kid' he says "I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating. If I draw on you, you'll kill me". Sundance stands and in his soft yet tough guy voice replies "There is that possibility". Throughout the film, he proceeds to show his skills with a gun and how he lives up to his reputation, even after Butch Cassidy jokes "You never could shoot". Although the violence in this film is kept to a minimum, it is used to a good effect. No shock values, its all clean, and most of the time with a sprinkle of humour. The dialogue in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is fast and snappy. The screenplay was constructed with such elegance, creating a combination of funny and emotionally enduring dialogue. The film's cinematography is also great, differing between the different colours on screen, the old fashioned photograph montage, etc. Its put together really effectively. Some scenes may seem to drag out for a while to some viewers. A sequence where Butch and Sundance are being traced by trackers, which was intended to create tension and excitement by stringing it out for as long as possible. Its not a complaint, but it just seemed like Director, Hill, was holding back to try and keep in compliance with real events. Having said this, the scene described above does end with the fantastic and well-known sequence where Paul Newman and Redford jump off the cliff to escape the trackers. The dialogue in that scene is rich, "I can't swim", "Ah, don't worry about that, the fall will probably kill ya." The performances by Newman and Redford are note-perfect in this film, and it really seemed to set up the basis for their film relationship, which led towards the 1973 classic 'The Sting'. Its kind of like Brad Pitt and George Clooney, in a way, I wonder if they have considered remaking this film with themselves as the title characters?... Brad Pitt does resemble a young Robert Redford. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an absolute classic <8 out 10> A great character study with great performances from Newman and Redford.

It still received the most awards for the year, but unfortunately, there was no Oscar Nomination for Paul Newman or Robert Redford. Butch Cassidy is one of the all-time greatest westerns, and is a fantastic character study based on the true events of two outlaws/train-robbers/bank-robbers. The film opens with an old fashioned film reel, projected in a small square on the screen which depicts the events which the film is based on. The images depicted are left open to interpretation of whether they are real footage or not, and that is all part of the fun. Once the credits have rolled, and the old-fashioned footage is over, it pans out to a full-size image. The colour in this sequence is spectacularly chosen, an old-fashioned, and not quite black and white set of scenes introducing our two title characters. Paul Newman is Butch Cassidy, the man who Sundance states is 'All-Talk'. He walks along and ponders the question "What happened to the old bank, it was beautiful?". He is told that it had to be closed down due to the fact that it was getting robbed to often. He shows that cheeky smile, a trademark of his throughout the film and replies "Ah Well. A Small Price to Pay for Beauty". Then we encounter the Sundance Kid, still in the old-fashioned colour sequence, playing cards with two men (one of them is a not-so-obvious Sam Elliot). After a bit of a winning streak, one of the men accuses Sundance of cheating. He stands up in an attempt to intimidate him, prepared to draw upon his gun as he tells him to leave the chips on the table and get out. Upon the discovery that he was playing against 'The Sundance Kid' he says "I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating. If I draw on you, you'll kill me". Sundance stands and in his soft yet tough guy voice replies "There is that possibility". Throughout the film, he proceeds to show his skills with a gun and how he lives up to his reputation, even after Butch Cassidy jokes "You never could shoot". Although the violence in this film is kept to a minimum, it is used to a good effect. No shock values, its all clean, and most of the time with a sprinkle of humour. The dialogue in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is fast and snappy. The screenplay was constructed with such elegance, creating a combination of funny and emotionally enduring dialogue. The film's cinematography is also great, differing between the different colours on screen, the old fashioned photograph montage, etc. Its put together really effectively. Some scenes may seem to drag out for a while to some viewers. A sequence where Butch and Sundance are being traced by trackers, which was intended to create tension and excitement by stringing it out for as long as possible. Its not a complaint, but it just seemed like Director, Hill, was holding back to try and keep in compliance with real events. Having said this, the scene described above does end with the fantastic and well-known sequence where Paul Newman and Redford jump off the cliff to escape the trackers. The dialogue in that scene is rich, "I can't swim", "Ah, don't worry about that, the fall will probably kill ya." The performances by Newman and Redford are note-perfect in this film, and it really seemed to set up the basis for their film relationship, which led towards the 1973 classic 'The Sting'. Its kind of like Brad Pitt and George Clooney, in a way, I wonder if they have considered remaking this film with themselves as the title characters?... Brad Pitt does resemble a young Robert Redford. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an absolute classic <8 out 10> A great character study with great performances from Newman and Redford.

    *Spoiler/plot- Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1969. When two bungling bank and train robbers tire of running from the law, they set out for Boliva with Sundance's girlfriend. Though they can barely speak enough Spanish to communicate 'This is a stick-up" that's only a minor detail to the nicest 'bad guys' who ever rode the West. *Special Stars- Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Catherince Ross, Trevor Martin. *Theme- Eveen if you're nice to be around but an outlaw, the law will catch-up with your lawlessness. *Trivia/location/goofs- Oscar winner 1969: best story & screenplay and Cinematography. Lead roles try-outs: Jack Lemon, Steve Mcqueen, Marlon Brando, and Warren Beatty. The final decision changed after Redford wanted the Butch role and Newman the Sundance role. *Emotion- A thoroughly enjoyable buddy film (+girlfriend) with excellent writing, casting and production values. This fine script took two obscure and little known Western characters and made them a house-hold word. A fine example of Hollywood's best achievement and a real treat for anyone watching this film. BTW: Be sure to see the who uncut version, because those reduced and edited TV or Cable versions does not give you the director's story on these characters.

    From the corny acting and one-liners (maybe 3 were funny?) to the incessant passing around of the girlfriend (I still can't assess who's girl it was) to the shrill music and long-ass pictures to substitute for acting, I thought it stunk. Heard so many good things about this, and I can handle a slow western (Outlaw Josey Wales). But this was something else. I only finished it on principle. Took me two days. Had to mute the Bolivian scenes, the music was so obnoxious, by God. Don't get the love for this weak, mediocre film. You could have accomplished the same thing, but in better fashion, with Young Guns II. Certainly has more heart, that's for sure. Give me True Grit or Josey Wales any day... ...this blows.

    Paul Newman & Robert Redford play Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid in director George Roy Hill's take on the historical pair of western outlaws who amiably(!) rob banks and trains with their hole-in-the-wall-gang, who soon find themselves wanted men who must flee across the west, taking refuge where they can, and especially with their lady friend Etta Place(Katherine Ross) before they make that fateful trip to Bolivia... Though Paul Newman & Robert Redford are undeniably appealing as the title characters, and the hit song, "Raindrops keep falling on my head" is wonderful, film itself is far too protracted and tedious to succeed; it just didn't hold my interest, though both "Unsolved Mysteries" & "In Search Of..." did excellent jobs focusing on Butch, and whether or not he survived that Bolivian gunfight(no word on Sundance). I'd much rather watch those accounts than this film...

    This film is far from your usual Western, unlike the works of Leone and Ford this films takes a different approach to the genre under the direction of George Roy Hill, it is a feel good, enjoyable film made that way by focusing on the lovable relationship between its two lead stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford. The two play a pair of infamous train robbers, the leading men of the 'Hole in the Wall gang' with the history of the duo shown in an enjoyable silent film as the film opens. In fact the duo have become so good at what they do that E. H. Harriman hires a 'supper-posse' to track them down due to the costs they are causing his rail company from their robberies. The first half of the film focused on introducing us to the two characters whose dialogue allows for some humorous and enjoyable moments, we see Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy ride around in his new bicycle to the tune of 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' in one of the film's most memorable scenes. From about the half way point the story completely changes, the plot that we have been given now becomes less focused on what is happening and more focused on the relationship setup between the three main characters (the third is Sundance's lover Katherine Ross ) as we have to endure what feels like a never ending chase between the lead duo and the posse. From a production viewpoint I can understand the complaints about the film, with the middle ending in particular seemed to be exaggerated as much as possible, the focus on this could have been used elsewhere with a stronger plot to make this film truly great. The film's downsides thankfully don't decrease our enjoyment for our film that much, the relationship of Newman and Redford dominates the film, once they get hired to transport money working in Bolivia we once again get to see their chemistry and great dialogue at the strongest with some great scenes again. The film won Academy Awards for its song and score but also for best original screenplay and cinematography, these are two of the film's strengths Â– the screenplay has some of the most memorable and funniest quotes between Newman and Redford and the cinematography creates some beautiful landscapes for us to enjoy in the scenes such as the posse chase and the rural terrain in Bolivia. And although the ending has been criticised I feel it sums up the film perfectly, we see the duo in an extremely difficult situation and the two exchange conversation with such brilliant and humorous dialogue -"For a moment there I thought we were in trouble". "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is one of the most unique Western films that there is, and it is one I would definitely recommend watching to fans both of the genre, it is definitely one of the most likable and enjoyable films of its kind despite its flaws.

    George Roy Hill directs one of the great westerns of the 1960s that didn't star John Wayne or Lee Van Cleef. "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" stars Robert Redford and Paul Newman, and the film made them icons and sex idols instantly. This film was very popular among movie-goers, that it gave rise to a whole new generation of American western films in the 1970s and 1980s. The soundtrack to the film is just as amazing as the film itself, with 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' sticking out. Also, the last scene in the film, which was set in Bolivia has stirred more interest in Butch and Sundance since the film was released in 1969. Robert Redford even used his character Sundance in the film, as the name of his film festival, which is recognized worldwide. The American conscience, without this film would be quite different.

    "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" tells the mostly true story of a pair of notorious outlaws on the lam. The film won four Oscars and is now regarded as a cinema classic. However, for me, it took a few viewings before I really warmed up to it. The movie is anything but a typical western. For one thing, part of the story takes place in Bolivia, of all locations. There's also more comedy than is usual for a western. Lastly, the Burt Bacharach score defies convention. Some of these quirks set the film apart in a good way while the effect of others is debatable. Personally, I feel that the script struggles a bit with tone and I also find that Bacharach's music is ill-suited for a western. However, it's tough to fault the actors. Newman and Redford have good chemistry together, making this a touchstone for countless buddy comedies to come. Katharine Ross has a more limited role but she performs well nonetheless. There are also some memorable performances in smaller roles, including Strother Martin as a 'colourful' mining company employee. I'm not a big fan of William Goldman's script, despite the fact that it won an Oscar. There are indeed some memorable scenes and dialogue but there's also some material that isn't particularly memorable. The script is also a bit too jokey to be taken very seriously when it tries to be serious. That being said, the climactic showdown does show a deft combination of action, humour & drama. As for the direction, George Roy Hill's Oscar-nominated work is indeed above average. However, I find Conrad Hall's cinematography to be hit or miss. At times, he & Hill went for (and achieved) a washed out look which I didn't care for at all. The Burt Bacharach score, which won an Oscar (plus another for the song "Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head"), doesn't particularly appeal to me either. Perhaps it's the juxtaposition of then-contemporary music with the western background that is unpalatable to me. Nevertheless, despite these complaints the film is still enjoyable. It's undeniably required viewing for movie buffs, though I would caution that the merits of its eccentricities are open to debate.

    My first western, it turns out, was more of a buddy movie described by another as a "Beatles movie in Bonnie and Clyde clothes". Our thieves carry on as the cocky folk heroes they became, full of confidence until doggedly chased by an unrelenting posse. Their journey is full of clever, but honest, dialog and their running from the law through nature's open and awesome backdrop is quite an awe inspiring site. Butch and Sundance mostly share their knowledge to try to figure out, "who are those guys?", to no avail. The movie would have been fine without the BJ Thomas hit, may have a plot full of movie inevitability but still has a style full of campfire camaraderie.

    I found this movie fairly entertaining for a western-type film. I appreciated the sarcastic humor that was spread throughout it. The montages were kinda upbeat and nice. The music wasn't typical for a western and I liked that. The "old" photos used to show passed time were neat. I found myself going back and forth between liking Butch and Cassidy and disliking them. Their friendship was adorable and how they bickered back and forth. But shooting people and being robbers, not so much. So I would go from laughing at their antics to then feeling sorry for the others involved. I thought the final scene was great, just those last few minutes... it was directed in a nice way to end the storyline.

    Butch Cassidy went to town at the 1969 academy awards, taking home four trophies and losing out to Jon Voight's 'Midnight Cowboy'. It still received the most awards for the year, but unfortunately, there was no Oscar Nomination for Paul Newman or Robert Redford. Butch Cassidy is one of the all-time greatest westerns, and is a fantastic character study based on the true events of two outlaws/train-robbers/bank-robbers. The film opens with an old fashioned film reel, projected in a small square on the screen which depicts the events which the film is based on. The images depicted are left open to interpretation of whether they are real footage or not, and that is all part of the fun. Once the credits have rolled, and the old-fashioned footage is over, it pans out to a full-size image. The colour in this sequence is spectacularly chosen, an old-fashioned, and not quite black and white set of scenes introducing our two title characters. Paul Newman is Butch Cassidy, the man who Sundance states is 'All-Talk'. He walks along and ponders the question "What happened to the old bank, it was beautiful?". He is told that it had to be closed down due to the fact that it was getting robbed to often. He shows that cheeky smile, a trademark of his throughout the film and replies "Ah Well. A Small Price to Pay for Beauty". Then we encounter the Sundance Kid, still in the old-fashioned colour sequence, playing cards with two men (one of them is a not-so-obvious Sam Elliot). After a bit of a winning streak, one of the men accuses Sundance of cheating. He stands up in an attempt to intimidate him, prepared to draw upon his gun as he tells him to leave the chips on the table and get out. Upon the discovery that he was playing against 'The Sundance Kid' he says "I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating. If I draw on you, you'll kill me". Sundance stands and in his soft yet tough guy voice replies "There is that possibility".

    My first western, it turns out, was more of a buddy movie described by another as a "Beatles movie in Bonnie and Clyde clothes". Our thieves carry on as the cocky folk heroes they became, full of confidence until doggedly chased by an unrelenting posse. Their journey is full of clever, but honest, dialog and their running from the law through nature's open and awesome backdrop is quite an awe inspiring site. Butch and Sundance mostly share their knowledge to try to figure out, "who are those guys?", to no avail. The movie would have been fine without the BJ Thomas hit, may have a plot full of movie inevitability but still has a style full of campfire camaraderie.

    I found this movie fairly entertaining for a western-type film. I appreciated the sarcastic humor that was spread throughout it. The montages were kinda upbeat and nice. The music wasn't typical for a western and I liked that. The "old" photos used to show passed time were neat. I found myself going back and forth between liking Butch and Cassidy and disliking them. Their friendship was adorable and how they bickered back and forth. But shooting people and being robbers, not so much. So I would go from laughing at their antics to then feeling sorry for the others involved. I thought the final scene was great, just those last few minutes... it was directed in a nice way to end the storyline.

    Butch Cassidy went to town at the 1969 academy awards, taking home four trophies and losing out to Jon Voight's 'Midnight Cowboy'. It still received the most awards for the year, but unfortunately, there was no Oscar Nomination for Paul Newman or Robert Redford. Butch Cassidy is one of the all-time greatest westerns, and is a fantastic character study based on the true events of two outlaws/train-robbers/bank-robbers. The film opens with an old fashioned film reel, projected in a small square on the screen which depicts the events which the film is based on. The images depicted are left open to interpretation of whether they are real footage or not, and that is all part of the fun. Once the credits have rolled, and the old-fashioned footage is over, it pans out to a full-size image. The colour in this sequence is spectacularly chosen, an old-fashioned, and not quite black and white set of scenes introducing our two title characters. Paul Newman is Butch Cassidy, the man who Sundance states is 'All-Talk'. He walks along and ponders the question "What happened to the old bank, it was beautiful?". He is told that it had to be closed down due to the fact that it was getting robbed to often. He shows that cheeky smile, a trademark of his throughout the film and replies "Ah Well. A Small Price to Pay for Beauty". Then we encounter the Sundance Kid, still in the old-fashioned colour sequence, playing cards with two men (one of them is a not-so-obvious Sam Elliot). After a bit of a winning streak, one of the men accuses Sundance of cheating. He stands up in an attempt to intimidate him, prepared to draw upon his gun as he tells him to leave the chips on the table and get out. Upon the discovery that he was playing against 'The Sundance Kid' he says "I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating. If I draw on you, you'll kill me". Sundance stands and in his soft yet tough guy voice replies "There is that possibility". Throughout the film, he proceeds to show his skills with a gun and how he lives up to his reputation, even after Butch Cassidy jokes "You never could shoot". Although the violence in this film is kept to a minimum, it is used to a good effect. No shock values, its all clean, and most of the time with a sprinkle of humour. The dialogue in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is fast and snappy. The screenplay was constructed with such elegance, creating a combination of funny and emotionally enduring dialogue. The film's cinematography is also great, differing between the different colours on screen, the old fashioned photograph montage, etc. Its put together really effectively. Some scenes may seem to drag out for a while to some viewers. A sequence where Butch and Sundance are being traced by trackers, which was intended to create tension and excitement by stringing it out for as long as possible. Its not a complaint, but it just seemed like Director, Hill, was holding back to try and keep in compliance with real events. Having said this, the scene described above does end with the fantastic and well-known sequence where Paul Newman and Redford jump off the cliff to escape the trackers. The dialogue in that scene is rich, "I can't swim", "Ah, don't worry about that, the fall will probably kill ya." The performances by Newman and Redford are note-perfect in this film, and it really seemed to set up the basis for their film relationship, which led towards the 1973 classic 'The Sting'. Its kind of like Brad Pitt and George Clooney, in a way, I wonder if they have considered remaking this film with themselves as the title characters?... Brad Pitt does resemble a young Robert Redford. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an absolute classic <8 out 10> A great character study with great performances from Newman and Redford.

    *Spoiler/plot- Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1969. When two bungling bank and train robbers tire of running from the law, they set out for Boliva with Sundance's girlfriend. Though they can barely speak enough Spanish to communicate 'This is a stick-up" that's only a minor detail to the nicest 'bad guys' who ever rode the West. *Special Stars- Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Catherince Ross, Trevor Martin. *Theme- Eveen if you're nice to be around but an outlaw, the law will catch-up with your lawlessness. *Trivia/location/goofs- Oscar winner 1969: best story & screenplay and Cinematography. Lead roles try-outs: Jack Lemon, Steve Mcqueen, Marlon Brando, and Warren Beatty. The final decision changed after Redford wanted the Butch role and Newman the Sundance role. *Emotion- A thoroughly enjoyable buddy film (+girlfriend) with excellent writing, casting and production values. This fine script took two obscure and little known Western characters and made them a house-hold word. A fine example of Hollywood's best achievement and a real treat for anyone watching this film. BTW: Be sure to see the who uncut version, because those reduced and edited TV or Cable versions does not give you the director's story on these characters.

    From the corny acting and one-liners (maybe 3 were funny?) to the incessant passing around of the girlfriend (I still can't assess who's girl it was) to the shrill music and long-ass pictures to substitute for acting, I thought it stunk. Heard so many good things about this, and I can handle a slow western (Outlaw Josey Wales). But this was something else. I only finished it on principle. Took me two days. Had to mute the Bolivian scenes, the music was so obnoxious, by God. Don't get the love for this weak, mediocre film. You could have accomplished the same thing, but in better fashion, with Young Guns II. Certainly has more heart, that's for sure. Give me True Grit or Josey Wales any day... ...this blows.

    real beautiful. for wise doses of humor and drama, for extraordinary performance, for few great scenes - bike wheel rotating in water, the plains and mountains, the posse as line of ambiguous menace. it is a mart film. than, a perfect story in the atmosphere of a world with nuances of magic. sepia photos solution, the charm of performance - like summer fruits in afternoon, the joy to do central characters. the feelings as puzzle and delicate nuances of love story. extraordinary dialogs. and the frame of entire movie like role of each viewer as part of film. so, it is little more than classic. it is always fresh and seductive. and, not less, smart work in which line between fiction and real facts is only convention. a story. in manner of Arabian Nights. only the place is different. but each space has its Scheherazade. in this case, respectable mister George Roy Hill.

    Paul Newman & Robert Redford play Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid in director George Roy Hill's take on the historical pair of western outlaws who amiably(!) rob banks and trains with their hole-in-the-wall-gang, who soon find themselves wanted men who must flee across the west, taking refuge where they can, and especially with their lady friend Etta Place(Katherine Ross) before they make that fateful trip to Bolivia... Though Paul Newman & Robert Redford are undeniably appealing as the title characters, and the hit song, "Raindrops keep falling on my head" is wonderful, film itself is far too protracted and tedious to succeed; it just didn't hold my interest, though both "Unsolved Mysteries" & "In Search Of..." did excellent jobs focusing on Butch, and whether or not he survived that Bolivian gunfight(no word on Sundance). I'd much rather watch those accounts than this film...

    This film is far from your usual Western, unlike the works of Leone and Ford this films takes a different approach to the genre under the direction of George Roy Hill, it is a feel good, enjoyable film made that way by focusing on the lovable relationship between its two lead stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford. The two play a pair of infamous train robbers, the leading men of the 'Hole in the Wall gang' with the history of the duo shown in an enjoyable silent film as the film opens. In fact the duo have become so good at what they do that E. H. Harriman hires a 'supper-posse' to track them down due to the costs they are causing his rail company from their robberies. The first half of the film focused on introducing us to the two characters whose dialogue allows for some humorous and enjoyable moments, we see Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy ride around in his new bicycle to the tune of 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' in one of the film's most memorable scenes. From about the half way point the story completely changes, the plot that we have been given now becomes less focused on what is happening and more focused on the relationship setup between the three main characters (the third is Sundance's lover Katherine Ross ) as we have to endure what feels like a never ending chase between the lead duo and the posse. From a production viewpoint I can understand the complaints about the film, with the middle ending in particular seemed to be exaggerated as much as possible, the focus on this could have been used elsewhere with a stronger plot to make this film truly great. The film's downsides thankfully don't decrease our enjoyment for our film that much, the relationship of Newman and Redford dominates the film, once they get hired to transport money working in Bolivia we once again get to see their chemistry and great dialogue at the strongest with some great scenes again. The film won Academy Awards for its song and score but also for best original screenplay and cinematography, these are two of the film's strengths Â– the screenplay has some of the most memorable and funniest quotes between Newman and Redford and the cinematography creates some beautiful landscapes for us to enjoy in the scenes such as the posse chase and the rural terrain in Bolivia. And although the ending has been criticised I feel it sums up the film perfectly, we see the duo in an extremely difficult situation and the two exchange conversation with such brilliant and humorous dialogue -"For a moment there I thought we were in trouble". "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is one of the most unique Western films that there is, and it is one I would definitely recommend watching to fans both of the genre, it is definitely one of the most likable and enjoyable films of its kind despite its flaws.

    George Roy Hill directs one of the great westerns of the 1960s that didn't star John Wayne or Lee Van Cleef. "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" stars Robert Redford and Paul Newman, and the film made them icons and sex idols instantly. This film was very popular among movie-goers, that it gave rise to a whole new generation of American western films in the 1970s and 1980s. The soundtrack to the film is just as amazing as the film itself, with 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' sticking out. Also, the last scene in the film, which was set in Bolivia has stirred more interest in Butch and Sundance since the film was released in 1969. Robert Redford even used his character Sundance in the film, as the name of his film festival, which is recognized worldwide. The American conscience, without this film would be quite different.

    "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" tells the mostly true story of a pair of notorious outlaws on the lam. The film won four Oscars and is now regarded as a cinema classic. However, for me, it took a few viewings before I really warmed up to it. The movie is anything but a typical western. For one thing, part of the story takes place in Bolivia, of all locations. There's also more comedy than is usual for a western. Lastly, the Burt Bacharach score defies convention. Some of these quirks set the film apart in a good way while the effect of others is debatable. Personally, I feel that the script struggles a bit with tone and I also find that Bacharach's music is ill-suited for a western. However, it's tough to fault the actors. Newman and Redford have good chemistry together, making this a touchstone for countless buddy comedies to come. Katharine Ross has a more limited role but she performs well nonetheless. There are also some memorable performances in smaller roles, including Strother Martin as a 'colourful' mining company employee. I'm not a big fan of William Goldman's script, despite the fact that it won an Oscar. There are indeed some memorable scenes and dialogue but there's also some material that isn't particularly memorable. The script is also a bit too jokey to be taken very seriously when it tries to be serious. That being said, the climactic showdown does show a deft combination of action, humour & drama. As for the direction, George Roy Hill's Oscar-nominated work is indeed above average. However, I find Conrad Hall's cinematography to be hit or miss. At times, he & Hill went for (and achieved) a washed out look which I didn't care for at all. The Burt Bacharach score, which won an Oscar (plus another for the song "Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head"), doesn't particularly appeal to me either. Perhaps it's the juxtaposition of then-contemporary music with the western background that is unpalatable to me. Nevertheless, despite these complaints the film is still enjoyable. It's undeniably required viewing for movie buffs, though I would caution that the merits of its eccentricities are open to debate.

    My first western, it turns out, was more of a buddy movie described by another as a "Beatles movie in Bonnie and Clyde clothes". Our thieves carry on as the cocky folk heroes they became, full of confidence until doggedly chased by an unrelenting posse. Their journey is full of clever, but honest, dialog and their running from the law through nature's open and awesome backdrop is quite an awe inspiring site. Butch and Sundance mostly share their knowledge to try to figure out, "who are those guys?", to no avail. The movie would have been fine without the BJ Thomas hit, may have a plot full of movie inevitability but still has a style full of campfire camaraderie.

    "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" tells the mostly true story of a pair of notorious outlaws on the lam. The film won four Oscars and is now regarded as a cinema classic. However, for me, it took a few viewings before I really warmed up to it. The movie is anything but a typical western. For one thing, part of the story takes place in Bolivia, of all locations. There's also more comedy than is usual for a western. Lastly, the Burt Bacharach score defies convention. Some of these quirks set the film apart in a good way while the effect of others is debatable. Personally, I feel that the script struggles a bit with tone and I also find that Bacharach's music is ill-suited for a western. However, it's tough to fault the actors. Newman and Redford have good chemistry together, making this a touchstone for countless buddy comedies to come. Katharine Ross has a more limited role but she performs well nonetheless. There are also some memorable performances in smaller roles, including Strother Martin as a 'colourful' mining company employee. I'm not a big fan of William Goldman's script, despite the fact that it won an Oscar. There are indeed some memorable scenes and dialogue but there's also some material that isn't particularly memorable. The script is also a bit too jokey to be taken very seriously when it tries to be serious. That being said, the climactic showdown does show a deft combination of action, humour & drama. As for the direction, George Roy Hill's Oscar-nominated work is indeed above average. However, I find Conrad Hall's cinematography to be hit or miss. At times, he & Hill went for (and achieved) a washed out look which I didn't care for at all. The Burt Bacharach score, which won an Oscar (plus another for the song "Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head"), doesn't particularly appeal to me either. Perhaps it's the juxtaposition of then-contemporary music with the western background that is unpalatable to me. Nevertheless, despite these complaints the film is still enjoyable. It's undeniably required viewing for movie buffs, though I would caution that the merits of its eccentricities are open to debate.

    My first western, it turns out, was more of a buddy movie described by another as a "Beatles movie in Bonnie and Clyde clothes". Our thieves carry on as the cocky folk heroes they became, full of confidence until doggedly chased by an unrelenting posse. Their journey is full of clever, but honest, dialog and their running from the law through nature's open and awesome backdrop is quite an awe inspiring site. Butch and Sundance mostly share their knowledge to try to figure out, "who are those guys?", to no avail. The movie would have been fine without the BJ Thomas hit, may have a plot full of movie inevitability but still has a style full of campfire camaraderie.

    I found this movie fairly entertaining for a western-type film. I appreciated the sarcastic humor that was spread throughout it. The montages were kinda upbeat and nice. The music wasn't typical for a western and I liked that. The "old" photos used to show passed time were neat. I found myself going back and forth between liking Butch and Cassidy and disliking them. Their friendship was adorable and how they bickered back and forth. But shooting people and being robbers, not so much. So I would go from laughing at their antics to then feeling sorry for the others involved. I thought the final scene was great, just those last few minutes... it was directed in a nice way to end the storyline.

    Butch Cassidy went to town at the 1969 academy awards, taking home four trophies and losing out to Jon Voight's 'Midnight Cowboy'. It still received the most awards for the year, but unfortunately, there was no Oscar Nomination for Paul Newman or Robert Redford. Butch Cassidy is one of the all-time greatest westerns, and is a fantastic character study based on the true events of two outlaws/train-robbers/bank-robbers. The film opens with an old fashioned film reel, projected in a small square on the screen which depicts the events which the film is based on. The images depicted are left open to interpretation of whether they are real footage or not, and that is all part of the fun. Once the credits have rolled, and the old-fashioned footage is over, it pans out to a full-size image. The colour in this sequence is spectacularly chosen, an old-fashioned, and not quite black and white set of scenes introducing our two title characters. Paul Newman is Butch Cassidy, the man who Sundance states is 'All-Talk'. He walks along and ponders the question "What happened to the old bank, it was beautiful?". He is told that it had to be closed down due to the fact that it was getting robbed to often. He shows that cheeky smile, a trademark of his throughout the film and replies "Ah Well. A Small Price to Pay for Beauty". Then we encounter the Sundance Kid, still in the old-fashioned colour sequence, playing cards with two men (one of them is a not-so-obvious Sam Elliot). After a bit of a winning streak, one of the men accuses Sundance of cheating. He stands up in an attempt to intimidate him, prepared to draw upon his gun as he tells him to leave the chips on the table and get out. Upon the discovery that he was playing against 'The Sundance Kid' he says "I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating. If I draw on you, you'll kill me". Sundance stands and in his soft yet tough guy voice replies "There is that possibility". Throughout the film, he proceeds to show his skills with a gun and how he lives up to his reputation, even after Butch Cassidy jokes "You never could shoot". Although the violence in this film is kept to a minimum, it is used to a good effect. No shock values, its all clean, and most of the time with a sprinkle of humour. The dialogue in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is fast and snappy. The screenplay was constructed with such elegance, creating a combination of funny and emotionally enduring dialogue. The film's cinematography is also great, differing between the different colours on screen, the old fashioned photograph montage, etc. Its put together really effectively. Some scenes may seem to drag out for a while to some viewers. A sequence where Butch and Sundance are being traced by trackers, which was intended to create tension and excitement by stringing it out for as long as possible. Its not a complaint, but it just seemed like Director, Hill, was holding back to try and keep in compliance with real events. Having said this, the scene described above does end with the fantastic and well-known sequence where Paul Newman and Redford jump off the cliff to escape the trackers. The dialogue in that scene is rich, "I can't swim", "Ah, don't worry about that, the fall will probably kill ya." The performances by Newman and Redford are note-perfect in this film, and it really seemed to set up the basis for their film relationship, which led towards the 1973 classic 'The Sting'. Its kind of like Brad Pitt and George Clooney, in a way, I wonder if they have considered remaking this film with themselves as the title characters?... Brad Pitt does resemble a young Robert Redford. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an absolute classic <8 out 10> A great character study with great performances from Newman and Redford.

    *Spoiler/plot- Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1969. When two bungling bank and train robbers tire of running from the law, they set out for Boliva with Sundance's girlfriend. Though they can barely speak enough Spanish to communicate 'This is a stick-up" that's only a minor detail to the nicest 'bad guys' who ever rode the West. *Special Stars- Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Catherince Ross, Trevor Martin. *Theme- Eveen if you're nice to be around but an outlaw, the law will catch-up with your lawlessness. *Trivia/location/goofs- Oscar winner 1969: best story & screenplay and Cinematography. Lead roles try-outs: Jack Lemon, Steve Mcqueen, Marlon Brando, and Warren Beatty. The final decision changed after Redford wanted the Butch role and Newman the Sundance role. *Emotion- A thoroughly enjoyable buddy film (+girlfriend) with excellent writing, casting and production values. This fine script took two obscure and little known Western characters and made them a house-hold word. A fine example of Hollywood's best achievement and a real treat for anyone watching this film. BTW: Be sure to see the who uncut version, because those reduced and edited TV or Cable versions does not give you the director's story on these characters.

    From the corny acting and one-liners (maybe 3 were funny?) to the incessant passing around of the girlfriend (I still can't assess who's girl it was) to the shrill music and long-ass pictures to substitute for acting, I thought it stunk. Heard so many good things about this, and I can handle a slow western (Outlaw Josey Wales). But this was something else. I only finished it on principle. Took me two days. Had to mute the Bolivian scenes, the music was so obnoxious, by God. Don't get the love for this weak, mediocre film. You could have accomplished the same thing, but in better fashion, with Young Guns II. Certainly has more heart, that's for sure. Give me True Grit or Josey Wales any day... ...this blows.

    real beautiful. for wise doses of humor and drama, for extraordinary performance, for few great scenes - bike wheel rotating in water, the plains and mountains, the posse as line of ambiguous menace. it is a mart film. than, a perfect story in the atmosphere of a world with nuances of magic. sepia photos solution, the charm of performance - like summer fruits in afternoon, the joy to do central characters. the feelings as puzzle and delicate nuances of love story. extraordinary dialogs. and the frame of entire movie like role of each viewer as part of film. so, it is little more than classic. it is always fresh and seductive. and, not less, smart work in which line between fiction and real facts is only convention. a story. in manner of Arabian Nights. only the place is different. but each space has its Scheherazade. in this case, respectable mister George Roy Hill.

    Paul Newman & Robert Redford play Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid in director George Roy Hill's take on the historical pair of western outlaws who amiably(!) rob banks and trains with their hole-in-the-wall-gang, who soon find themselves wanted men who must flee across the west, taking refuge where they can, and especially with their lady friend Etta Place(Katherine Ross) before they make that fateful trip to Bolivia... Though Paul Newman & Robert Redford are undeniably appealing as the title characters, and the hit song, "Raindrops keep falling on my head" is wonderful, film itself is far too protracted and tedious to succeed; it just didn't hold my interest, though both "Unsolved Mysteries" & "In Search Of..." did excellent jobs focusing on Butch, and whether or not he survived that Bolivian gunfight(no word on Sundance). I'd much rather watch those accounts than this film...

    This film is far from your usual Western, unlike the works of Leone and Ford this films takes a different approach to the genre under the direction of George Roy Hill, it is a feel good, enjoyable film made that way by focusing on the lovable relationship between its two lead stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford. The two play a pair of infamous train robbers, the leading men of the 'Hole in the Wall gang' with the history of the duo shown in an enjoyable silent film as the film opens. In fact the duo have become so good at what they do that E. H. Harriman hires a 'supper-posse' to track them down due to the costs they are causing his rail company from their robberies. The first half of the film focused on introducing us to the two characters whose dialogue allows for some humorous and enjoyable moments, we see Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy ride around in his new bicycle to the tune of 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' in one of the film's most memorable scenes. From about the half way point the story completely changes, the plot that we have been given now becomes less focused on what is happening and more focused on the relationship setup between the three main characters (the third is Sundance's lover Katherine Ross ) as we have to endure what feels like a never ending chase between the lead duo and the posse. From a production viewpoint I can understand the complaints about the film, with the middle ending in particular seemed to be exaggerated as much as possible, the focus on this could have been used elsewhere with a stronger plot to make this film truly great. The film's downsides thankfully don't decrease our enjoyment for our film that much, the relationship of Newman and Redford dominates the film, once they get hired to transport money working in Bolivia we once again get to see their chemistry and great dialogue at the strongest with some great scenes again. The film won Academy Awards for its song and score but also for best original screenplay and cinematography, these are two of the film's strengths Â– the screenplay has some of the most memorable and funniest quotes between Newman and Redford and the cinematography creates some beautiful landscapes for us to enjoy in the scenes such as the posse chase and the rural terrain in Bolivia. And although the ending has been criticised I feel it sums up the film perfectly, we see the duo in an extremely difficult situation and the two exchange conversation with such brilliant and humorous dialogue -"For a moment there I thought we were in trouble". "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is one of the most unique Western films that there is, and it is one I would definitely recommend watching to fans both of the genre, it is definitely one of the most likable and enjoyable films of its kind despite its flaws.

    George Roy Hill directs one of the great westerns of the 1960s that didn't star John Wayne or Lee Van Cleef. "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" stars Robert Redford and Paul Newman, and the film made them icons and sex idols instantly. This film was very popular among movie-goers, that it gave rise to a whole new generation of American western films in the 1970s and 1980s. The soundtrack to the film is just as amazing as the film itself, with 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' sticking out. Also, the last scene in the film, which was set in Bolivia has stirred more interest in Butch and Sundance since the film was released in 1969. Robert Redford even used his character Sundance in the film, as the name of his film festival, which is recognized worldwide. The American conscience, without this film would be quite different.

Some of these quirks set the film apart in a good way while the effect of others is debatable. Personally, I feel that the script struggles a bit with tone and I also find that Bacharach's music is ill-suited for a western. However, it's tough to fault the actors. Newman and Redford have good chemistry together, making this a touchstone for countless buddy comedies to come. Katharine Ross has a more limited role but she performs well nonetheless. There are also some memorable performances in smaller roles, including Strother Martin as a 'colourful' mining company employee. I'm not a big fan of William Goldman's script, despite the fact that it won an Oscar. There are indeed some memorable scenes and dialogue but there's also some material that isn't particularly memorable. The script is also a bit too jokey to be taken very seriously when it tries to be serious. That being said, the climactic showdown does show a deft combination of action, humour & drama. As for the direction, George Roy Hill's Oscar-nominated work is indeed above average. However, I find Conrad Hall's cinematography to be hit or miss. At times, he & Hill went for (and achieved) a washed out look which I didn't care for at all. The Burt Bacharach score, which won an Oscar (plus another for the song "Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head"), doesn't particularly appeal to me either. Perhaps it's the juxtaposition of then-contemporary music with the western background that is unpalatable to me. Nevertheless, despite these complaints the film is still enjoyable. It's undeniably required viewing for movie buffs, though I would caution that the merits of its eccentricities are open to debate.

From a production viewpoint I can understand the complaints about the film, with the middle ending in particular seemed to be exaggerated as much as possible, the focus on this could have been used elsewhere with a stronger plot to make this film truly great. The film's downsides thankfully don't decrease our enjoyment for our film that much, the relationship of Newman and Redford dominates the film, once they get hired to transport money working in Bolivia we once again get to see their chemistry and great dialogue at the strongest with some great scenes again. The film won Academy Awards for its song and score but also for best original screenplay and cinematography, these are two of the film's strengths Â– the screenplay has some of the most memorable and funniest quotes between Newman and Redford and the cinematography creates some beautiful landscapes for us to enjoy in the scenes such as the posse chase and the rural terrain in Bolivia. And although the ending has been criticised I feel it sums up the film perfectly, we see the duo in an extremely difficult situation and the two exchange conversation with such brilliant and humorous dialogue -"For a moment there I thought we were in trouble". "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is one of the most unique Western films that there is, and it is one I would definitely recommend watching to fans both of the genre, it is definitely one of the most likable and enjoyable films of its kind despite its flaws.

    George Roy Hill directs one of the great westerns of the 1960s that didn't star John Wayne or Lee Van Cleef. "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" stars Robert Redford and Paul Newman, and the film made them icons and sex idols instantly. This film was very popular among movie-goers, that it gave rise to a whole new generation of American western films in the 1970s and 1980s. The soundtrack to the film is just as amazing as the film itself, with 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' sticking out. Also, the last scene in the film, which was set in Bolivia has stirred more interest in Butch and Sundance since the film was released in 1969. Robert Redford even used his character Sundance in the film, as the name of his film festival, which is recognized worldwide. The American conscience, without this film would be quite different.

    "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" tells the mostly true story of a pair of notorious outlaws on the lam. The film won four Oscars and is now regarded as a cinema classic. However, for me, it took a few viewings before I really warmed up to it. The movie is anything but a typical western. For one thing, part of the story takes place in Bolivia, of all locations. There's also more comedy than is usual for a western. Lastly, the Burt Bacharach score defies convention. Some of these quirks set the film apart in a good way while the effect of others is debatable. Personally, I feel that the script struggles a bit with tone and I also find that Bacharach's music is ill-suited for a western. However, it's tough to fault the actors. Newman and Redford have good chemistry together, making this a touchstone for countless buddy comedies to come. Katharine Ross has a more limited role but she performs well nonetheless. There are also some memorable performances in smaller roles, including Strother Martin as a 'colourful' mining company employee. I'm not a big fan of William Goldman's script, despite the fact that it won an Oscar. There are indeed some memorable scenes and dialogue but there's also some material that isn't particularly memorable. The script is also a bit too jokey to be taken very seriously when it tries to be serious. That being said, the climactic showdown does show a deft combination of action, humour & drama. As for the direction, George Roy Hill's Oscar-nominated work is indeed above average. However, I find Conrad Hall's cinematography to be hit or miss. At times, he & Hill went for (and achieved) a washed out look which I didn't care for at all. The Burt Bacharach score, which won an Oscar (plus another for the song "Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head"), doesn't particularly appeal to me either. Perhaps it's the juxtaposition of then-contemporary music with the western background that is unpalatable to me. Nevertheless, despite these complaints the film is still enjoyable. It's undeniably required viewing for movie buffs, though I would caution that the merits of its eccentricities are open to debate.

    My first western, it turns out, was more of a buddy movie described by another as a "Beatles movie in Bonnie and Clyde clothes". Our thieves carry on as the cocky folk heroes they became, full of confidence until doggedly chased by an unrelenting posse. Their journey is full of clever, but honest, dialog and their running from the law through nature's open and awesome backdrop is quite an awe inspiring site. Butch and Sundance mostly share their knowledge to try to figure out, "who are those guys?", to no avail. The movie would have been fine without the BJ Thomas hit, may have a plot full of movie inevitability but still has a style full of campfire camaraderie.

    I found this movie fairly entertaining for a western-type film. I appreciated the sarcastic humor that was spread throughout it. The montages were kinda upbeat and nice. The music wasn't typical for a western and I liked that. The "old" photos used to show passed time were neat. I found myself going back and forth between liking Butch and Cassidy and disliking them. Their friendship was adorable and how they bickered back and forth. But shooting people and being robbers, not so much. So I would go from laughing at their antics to then feeling sorry for the others involved. I thought the final scene was great, just those last few minutes... it was directed in a nice way to end the storyline.

    Butch Cassidy went to town at the 1969 academy awards, taking home four trophies and losing out to Jon Voight's 'Midnight Cowboy'. It still received the most awards for the year, but unfortunately, there was no Oscar Nomination for Paul Newman or Robert Redford. Butch Cassidy is one of the all-time greatest westerns, and is a fantastic character study based on the true events of two outlaws/train-robbers/bank-robbers. The film opens with an old fashioned film reel, projected in a small square on the screen which depicts the events which the film is based on. The images depicted are left open to interpretation of whether they are real footage or not, and that is all part of the fun. Once the credits have rolled, and the old-fashioned footage is over, it pans out to a full-size image. The colour in this sequence is spectacularly chosen, an old-fashioned, and not quite black and white set of scenes introducing our two title characters. Paul Newman is Butch Cassidy, the man who Sundance states is 'All-Talk'. He walks along and ponders the question "What happened to the old bank, it was beautiful?". He is told that it had to be closed down due to the fact that it was getting robbed to often. He shows that cheeky smile, a trademark of his throughout the film and replies "Ah Well. A Small Price to Pay for Beauty". Then we encounter the Sundance Kid, still in the old-fashioned colour sequence, playing cards with two men (one of them is a not-so-obvious Sam Elliot). After a bit of a winning streak, one of the men accuses Sundance of cheating. He stands up in an attempt to intimidate him, prepared to draw upon his gun as he tells him to leave the chips on the table and get out. Upon the discovery that he was playing against 'The Sundance Kid' he says "I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating. If I draw on you, you'll kill me". Sundance stands and in his soft yet tough guy voice replies "There is that possibility". Throughout the film, he proceeds to show his skills with a gun and how he lives up to his reputation, even after Butch Cassidy jokes "You never could shoot". Although the violence in this film is kept to a minimum, it is used to a good effect. No shock values, its all clean, and most of the time with a sprinkle of humour. The dialogue in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is fast and snappy. The screenplay was constructed with such elegance, creating a combination of funny and emotionally enduring dialogue. The film's cinematography is also great, differing between the different colours on screen, the old fashioned photograph montage, etc. Its put together really effectively. Some scenes may seem to drag out for a while to some viewers. A sequence where Butch and Sundance are being traced by trackers, which was intended to create tension and excitement by stringing it out for as long as possible. Its not a complaint, but it just seemed like Director, Hill, was holding back to try and keep in compliance with real events. Having said this, the scene described above does end with the fantastic and well-known sequence where Paul Newman and Redford jump off the cliff to escape the trackers. The dialogue in that scene is rich, "I can't swim", "Ah, don't worry about that, the fall will probably kill ya." The performances by Newman and Redford are note-perfect in this film, and it really seemed to set up the basis for their film relationship, which led towards the 1973 classic 'The Sting'. Its kind of like Brad Pitt and George Clooney, in a way, I wonder if they have considered remaking this film with themselves as the title characters?... Brad Pitt does resemble a young Robert Redford. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an absolute classic <8 out 10> A great character study with great performances from Newman and Redford.

    *Spoiler/plot- Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1969. When two bungling bank and train robbers tire of running from the law, they set out for Boliva with Sundance's girlfriend. Though they can barely speak enough Spanish to communicate 'This is a stick-up" that's only a minor detail to the nicest 'bad guys' who ever rode the West. *Special Stars- Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Catherince Ross, Trevor Martin. *Theme- Eveen if you're nice to be around but an outlaw, the law will catch-up with your lawlessness. *Trivia/location/goofs- Oscar winner 1969: best story & screenplay and Cinematography. Lead roles try-outs: Jack Lemon, Steve Mcqueen, Marlon Brando, and Warren Beatty. The final decision changed after Redford wanted the Butch role and Newman the Sundance role. *Emotion- A thoroughly enjoyable buddy film (+girlfriend) with excellent writing, casting and production values. This fine script took two obscure and little known Western characters and made them a house-hold word. A fine example of Hollywood's best achievement and a real treat for anyone watching this film. BTW: Be sure to see the who uncut version, because those reduced and edited TV or Cable versions does not give you the director's story on these characters.

    From the corny acting and one-liners (maybe 3 were funny?) to the incessant passing around of the girlfriend (I still can't assess who's girl it was) to the shrill music and long-ass pictures to substitute for acting, I thought it stunk. Heard so many good things about this, and I can handle a slow western (Outlaw Josey Wales). But this was something else. I only finished it on principle. Took me two days. Had to mute the Bolivian scenes, the music was so obnoxious, by God. Don't get the love for this weak, mediocre film. You could have accomplished the same thing, but in better fashion, with Young Guns II. Certainly has more heart, that's for sure. Give me True Grit or Josey Wales any day... ...this blows.

    real beautiful. for wise doses of humor and drama, for extraordinary performance, for few great scenes - bike wheel rotating in water, the plains and mountains, the posse as line of ambiguous menace. it is a mart film. than, a perfect story in the atmosphere of a world with nuances of magic. sepia photos solution, the charm of performance - like summer fruits in afternoon, the joy to do central characters. the feelings as puzzle and delicate nuances of love story. extraordinary dialogs. and the frame of entire movie like role of each viewer as part of film. so, it is little more than classic. it is always fresh and seductive. and, not less, smart work in which line between fiction and real facts is only convention. a story. in manner of Arabian Nights. only the place is different. but each space has its Scheherazade. in this case, respectable mister George Roy Hill.
