    (Plot) A children's doll house is eerily reminiscent of the house in most of the Amityville movies. A girl winds up with the miniature house and somehow evil commences. I cannot begin to comprehend how so many of these blasted films got made. I didn't even care for the original movie that much. It was dull and overlong, so who in there right mind thought we deserved all this needless suffering?! This one has some unintentional laughs. Jimmy's (Clayton Murray) dead Father is conjured up by the demon. Not only is the makeup absolutely laughable, but I couldn't understand something. How did it take the kid so long to realize his Father wasn't who he said he was? I get that kids are gullible, but that was a bit much for me. The Martin family isn't all that likable in all honesty, and I didn't feel any suspense, just 90 minutes or so of god awful movie making, and boredom. Final Thoughts: There are two horror series which committed unspeakable sins Amityville Horror & Children of The Corn; what did they both have in common? An endless string of terrible DTV sequels and this is one of those sequels. Leave it alone where it belongs 1/10

    The 'Amityville' series grinds on with this witless entry in which a family discover an old dollhouse in the garage of their new home, leading to the usual spooky problems and the usual lack of engagement. Aside from a couple of promising bits and pieces (the stepmom's crush, or the doll coming to life) the familiar story flops in some amazingly predictable directions (like the kid who wishes he could see his dead father, you know the rest) while the obligatory witchcraft experts are on hand to explain everything to the characters and the audience. We're also treated to such ripe dialogue as, 'If it's a portal... it's the welcome mat to Hell' and my personal favourite, 'Tamazarak... samahak... athofamalos, you bastards!!'. Cack.

    Evil can be found in the most unlikely of places. Normally in movies it's found in a house or a person. Other times it's animals or dolls that have somehow gone bad. Inanimate objects coming to life to kill is a pretty scary idea. It's been done effectively, but often times it's a missed opportunity. 'Amityville' parts 4, 6 and 7 all dealt with objects from the cursed dwelling terrorizing new victims. This eighth chapter continues this tradition and isn't too bad. Pros: Decent acting. Suspenseful. Effective score. Nice job on the make-up and special effects. Some neat ideas. Never dull. Feeling of doom hangs over the film. Cons: Not much plot. Nothing we haven't already seen. Pace drags a bit. Lacking scares. Final thoughts: The original 'Amityville Horror' was a success in it's time. However, I don't think anyone imagined there be so many sequels. Though not one of the best, 'Amityville Dollhouse' is a lot better than it should be. Would really do the trick on a rainy afternoon or evening. My rating: 3/5

    Amityville: Dollhouse (1996) * (out of 4) Silly eighth entry in the original series has a husband moving his son and daughter into a house he built with his new wife and her son. None of the kids like the other parent but things take a turn for the worse when daddy finds an old dollhouse in a shed, which just happens to be a replica of the Amityville house. Soon enough all sorts of weird things begin to happen and of course no one thinks about destroying the dollhouse. AMITYVILLE: DOLLHOUSE is yet another direct-to-video cash-in on the original series and I guess the producers knew it was such a turkey that they didn't even try to make another one. This is a pretty bad film on many levels but unlike some of the other rip-offs (like AMITHVILLE: IT'S ABOUT TIME), this one here doesn't work on any level. Most of these sequels had little to nothing to do with the original film but it's clear the title Amityville meant rentals so we had all sorts of strange stories made up with that title added. There's very little working for this movie but at least the creatures at the very end look pretty good. Outside of that it's your typical low-budget horror movie with bland performances, a bad story and just nothing exciting going on. The death scenes are all laughable and just wait until you see the giant mouse that shows up.

    Bill Martin (Robin Thomas) and his new wife Claire (Starr Andreeff) move into the new house he built in the California mountains. In a shed outback he finds a cute little dollhouse designed just like the famous Amityville, NY abode. How this got here or who built it is never explained. This is no Barbie Dream House though as this dollhouse crushes Bill's gift bike for his daughter's birthday and the parents resort to the "this should make a great gift" routine. The eighth and final Amityville flick before they did the remake. After part 3, the producers felt they could circumvent the whole Amityville house thing by having various possessed items from the house be the gateway to terror. So we had a lamp (AMITYVILLE: THE EVIL ESCAPES), a confessional (THE AMITYVILLE CURSE), a clock (AMITYVILLE: IT'S ABOUT TIME) and a mirror (AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION). So I guess a dollhouse isn't that ridiculous. This is actually a two-for-one deal as we get a possessed recycled fireplace too (there is general confusion as the house was built on foundation of an old house that blew up to suggest it was the Amityville house, but this is clearly set in California). I'm just glad they stopped with this one or we would have ended up with the likes of possessed toaster in AMITYVILLE: YOU'RE TOAST. Or an evil stove in AMITYVILLE: YOUR BLOOD BOILS. One thing this sequel does that is surprising is bring back the taboo sex angle from part 2, along they play it a bit safer with the stepmom lusting for the stepson. Other than that, it is pretty routine stuff with the occasional cool effect here and there (like the progressively rotting dad who haunts his young son a la John Landis' werewolf classic).

    Amityville Dollhouse is the 8th installment in this long drawn out series. This one is actually pretty decent. It's about a man who finds a dollhouse which looks exactly like the Amityville house. As soon as he gives the dollhouse to his daughter for her birthday, strange things start to happen. The fireplace turns on and off, windows open and close by themselves, a gigantic mouse hides under a bed, and the man's wife gets the hots for her teenage stepson. Classic signs in Amityville sequels that something just isn't right. What irritates me is that the young girl and her aunt realize there is something evil about the dollhouse, but do not destroy it right away. Instead, they think it's best if the little girl writes down all of the strange things that happen with regards to the dollhouse. There are some cool scares and sequences in the movie. The gigantic mouse scene is well done, the bug in the ear is cringe worthy, and the younger son's deceased father coming back from the dead is pretty creepy. Overall, this is one of the better Amityville sequels. The story goes on at a good pace and is never dull or tedious. The only downfall like many other of the Amityville sequels is that it has almost nothing to do with Amityville - other than the replica dollhouse. It's hard to get on DVD, but if you can, check this one out. 6/10

    This family have just moved into a normal house, this family has a mother named Claire who as one son called Jimmy , Claire is Married to Bill who has daughter Jessica and she as a older brother Todd but Jimmy (who is very annoying) dose not seem to like his step family, however the other do like like then step-mum. When Bill goes to the shed he find the doll house that is the Amityville House. Soom strange thinks start to happen in the house, the haunted doll house break the daughter bike they were going to give her for her Birthday so they end up giving the doll house instead but she soon finds out that the doll house is evil. Jimmy is also affected by evil force as they got his dad back from the dead to see him, at first his happy to see his dead dad that look like a Zombie but soon starts to get scared of him as he think he dead dad is going kill step dad. My favourite scene is this movie as to be when Jimmy Mouse goes to Jessica room and enter the doll house and as the mouse goes in the doll house goes under the bed in that in the doll house and then Jessica bed starts shake and she see an enormous white mouse appears under her bed. I really liked that scenes it was really well made, I enjoyed that scene and the whole movie, it was very entertaining from start to the end and it was not boring or predictable like previous movies at all. I liked the way the the movie ended and acting great in this movie. I am going to give this movie 8 out of 10

    The Amityville Horror: in the real world, it's about a young man brutally murdering his family one night on a drug-fuelled rampage. In the world of film and fantasy, it's about demons in the cellar, possession, evil lamps, sinister clocks and unnecessary 3D. The film franchise has had a long life and some of the installments have been - and let's be kind here - god-awful. 'Dollhouse' was the very final installment before someone turned back the clock with the 2005 reboot, and having watched every single Amityville thus far made, I can honestly say it's not the worst. No, for that, we have to go back to 1992 for the pain and misery that is 'The Amityville Possession'. Many of the sequels would spin a yarn from an artifact removed from the Long Island house that would then raise hell in a new setting. In 'Dollhouse', the house itself is an artifact in miniature. When the Martins, a dysfunctional Brady-style family (two single parents and their kids coming together as one unit) move into their new home, conflicts are down-to-earth and domestic until Martin Snr finds an old dollhouse in the shed that just happens to be the spitting image of the infamous residence in Long Island. As soon as the replica is brought into the house, things begin to go pear-shaped. Household appliances take on a life of their own, people start having bad dreams, and Jimmy, the youngest son, begins to see the rotting animated corpse of his dead birth father. Will everyone realise the cause of the disturbances in time, or will they all succumb to the evil designs of the dollhouse? Amityville VIII, unlike its predecessors, makes no attempt to tie its plot in with the source material. No references are made to the DeFeo murders, demonic possession, or even the house itself. The only connection is the obvious visual link with the Dutch-colonial dollhouse, whose origins are never explored. It's as if the producers are saying 'Look, it's straight-to-video, you know the story, no-one will be watching who doesn't.' However, putting aside the very obvious question regarding where the dollhouse came from and what connection - if any - it has to the actual Amityville house, the story follows the familiar structure of its predecessors: characters possessed by demonic forces, unexplainable local phenomena and even killer insects. Also present is that same sense of deja vu, wherein you once again know you're watching a generic horror film with the word 'Amityville' stamped on it. To expect a lot at this stage however, after even the recycled ideas have been recycled, would be asking too much. This latest retreading still manages to be entertaining and not without its moments, and the actors present give convincing enough performances with the material handed to them. Compared with other entries in the series,the horror elements here are lower in tone, and the death scenes few and far between. There are a few dodgy monster moments, which while tied into the plot, aren't realised with the kind of budget that would do them justice, and the prosthetics only just about work. Overall however, the story follows its own internal logic well enough not to cause irritation and so long as you don't try to integrate it into the Amityville universe, it's an entertaining enough 90 minutes. I have to say that watching every Amityville in the series has been torturously painful at times, sometimes making me wonder why I'm a sucker for B-grade horror. However, there have been some notable entries as well, with 1992's 'It's About Time' probably the most imaginative. 'Dollhouse' is a less ambitious rehashing of the formula, but it stands above the real clankers, enough to not leave a bitter aftertaste.

    "Amityville Dollhouse" is Part 8 in the "Amityville Saga" and I saw them all last week. So let's look back at all of them.. "The Amityville Horror" (1979): Still a classic like "The Shining" and "Poltergeist". A scary story based on true events with solid performances by James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger. After 30 years, it's still a strong movie and not outdated at all. "Amityville II: The Possession" (1982): A Very good sequel, not as strong as the original because it has it's flaws. The last 20 minutes is a bit too much a rip-off of "The Exorcist". But once again, scary with a good cast (Burt Young from the "Rocky" films) and it was daring to put the incest element in the plot, but it works very well to it's advantage. "Amityville 3D: The Demon" (1983) : After the success of the second one, quickly produced again by Dino DeLaurentius. The first weak entry in the series, not scary with a weak ending and poor effects. "Amityville Horror: The Evil Escapes" (1989) : One of the worst, with a stupid plot: an ugly lamp from the original house (that was blown up at the end of Part 3, so what the hell ?) holds the demon that terrorizes a new family. Made-For-TV movie that comes off very cheap. "The Amityville Curse" (1990) : Another bad TV-movie, many reviews say this is the worst but at least there is some horror at the end. It's not PG-13 stuff like the previous two and it has Kim Coates. But he can't save the dull story that goes absolutely nowhere. "Amityville 1992: It's About Time" (1992) : The best of all sequels besides the second part. This time, directed by Tony Randell (Hellbound: Hellraiser II, Ticks). With once again a decent score (Daniel Licht) and an entertaining story. This was actually based on the same novel as the fourth one (Amityville: The Evil Escapes) but it's way better !! "Amityville: A New Generation" (1993) : A good cast but overall not a very convincing story. David Naughton (An American Werewolf In London), Terry O'Quinn (The Stepfather, TV's Lost) and Julia Nickson (Rambo: First Blood Part II): Nice to see them again. But that's the only good thing, this is certainly not one of the worst sequels, but that does not mean it's a really good genre movie. "Amityville Dollhouse" (1996) : The eight movie with once again something from the original house. Not a lamp, not a clock but this time a dollhouse which is in fact the model of the original house from Part 1. Hardly original, the girl looks a lot like the one from "Poltergeist" (just look at the poster, not badly done..) and the demons at the end do remind you of the ending of "Hellraiser". But this time they're not scary at all. Those special make-up effects are not convincing. But there is one good thing: the make-up effects used for the zombie soldier are very well done. But once again, not original because they stole that from "House" (1986). Not scary, not convincing, unfortunately another weak entry in the series. Luckily, the stopped making sequels after that one. In 2005 the remake of the original one was released with Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George. I have to say that it's certainly not as good as the original, but looking at the sequels, it's the best "Amityville" since part 2.

    Don't ask me what encouraged me to re-watch this. Can't really explain it myself. I guess I just wanted to see if I thought it was still "okay" (as that was what I seemed to remember about it from my 90's viewing). And I guess it probably is "okay", though it feels kind of wrong to say it. Because AMITYVILLE: DOLLHOUSE seems as good an example as many, to show why horror was going the wrong way during the 90's: It's just too unimaginative, formulaic and generic. It basically fails to impress. We got a new family moving into a new house (Starr Andreeff might actually be a reason for some to watch this -- I myself was kind of pleased that at least she was in it). Daddy finds a dollhouse in the backyard shack and gives it to his daughter -- and since we've seen all the previous Amityville-installments, we can only guess that the toy house is a vessel inhabited by the Amityville-evil. And the evil manifests itself in many ways (at least there's some variety in these matters), which soon becomes too routinely. Best one of these manifestations is probably a dead & rotten ghost-daddy coming back from the grave, playing his evil tricks. There's a somewhat interesting subplot about the history of the house, once destroyed in a fire, but not much is done with it. It's basically family-stuff going on in some scenes (presumably to give the characters some depth), mixed with supernatural happenings on which you can set a timer (that's how routinely it all plays out). And by the time the climax comes around - featuring a dimensional-portal through a fireplace, two pitchfork-wielding demons (doing nothing more than just that) and some master-devil-dude-puppet with wings that don't fly - it's just too little, too late. AMITYVILLE: DOLLHOUSE might be pleasing for undemanding horror fans growing up in the 90's, and it's far from the worst horror movie you'll ever see. But it doesn't hold a candle to most other sequels from other franchises being cranked out at the time (and even before its straight-to-video release). On the upside: It didn't get any worse after 1993's AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION and it does sort of have the same vibe as AMITYVILLE: IT'S ABOUT TIME. In fact, all three movies are about on par with each other. Does that say anything? I thought of a plea for abating circumstances, when it comes to this installment... but only a little more, a little sooner would have gained it an extra point.

    Amityville Dollhouse is the 8th installment in this long drawn out series. This one is actually pretty decent. It's about a man who finds a dollhouse which looks exactly like the Amityville house. As soon as he gives the dollhouse to his daughter for her birthday, strange things start to happen. The fireplace turns on and off, windows open and close by themselves, a gigantic mouse hides under a bed, and the man's wife gets the hots for her teenage stepson. Classic signs in Amityville sequels that something just isn't right. What irritates me is that the young girl and her aunt realize there is something evil about the dollhouse, but do not destroy it right away. Instead, they think it's best if the little girl writes down all of the strange things that happen with regards to the dollhouse. There are some cool scares and sequences in the movie. The gigantic mouse scene is well done, the bug in the ear is cringe worthy, and the younger son's deceased father coming back from the dead is pretty creepy. Overall, this is one of the better Amityville sequels. The story goes on at a good pace and is never dull or tedious. The only downfall like many other of the Amityville sequels is that it has almost nothing to do with Amityville - other than the replica dollhouse. It's hard to get on DVD, but if you can, check this one out. 6/10

    This family have just moved into a normal house, this family has a mother named Claire who as one son called Jimmy , Claire is Married to Bill who has daughter Jessica and she as a older brother Todd but Jimmy (who is very annoying) dose not seem to like his step family, however the other do like like then step-mum. When Bill goes to the shed he find the doll house that is the Amityville House. Soom strange thinks start to happen in the house, the haunted doll house break the daughter bike they were going to give her for her Birthday so they end up giving the doll house instead but she soon finds out that the doll house is evil. Jimmy is also affected by evil force as they got his dad back from the dead to see him, at first his happy to see his dead dad that look like a Zombie but soon starts to get scared of him as he think he dead dad is going kill step dad. My favourite scene is this movie as to be when Jimmy Mouse goes to Jessica room and enter the doll house and as the mouse goes in the doll house goes under the bed in that in the doll house and then Jessica bed starts shake and she see an enormous white mouse appears under her bed. I really liked that scenes it was really well made, I enjoyed that scene and the whole movie, it was very entertaining from start to the end and it was not boring or predictable like previous movies at all. I liked the way the the movie ended and acting great in this movie. I am going to give this movie 8 out of 10

    The Amityville Horror: in the real world, it's about a young man brutally murdering his family one night on a drug-fuelled rampage. In the world of film and fantasy, it's about demons in the cellar, possession, evil lamps, sinister clocks and unnecessary 3D. The film franchise has had a long life and some of the installments have been - and let's be kind here - god-awful. 'Dollhouse' was the very final installment before someone turned back the clock with the 2005 reboot, and having watched every single Amityville thus far made, I can honestly say it's not the worst. No, for that, we have to go back to 1992 for the pain and misery that is 'The Amityville Possession'. Many of the sequels would spin a yarn from an artifact removed from the Long Island house that would then raise hell in a new setting. In 'Dollhouse', the house itself is an artifact in miniature. When the Martins, a dysfunctional Brady-style family (two single parents and their kids coming together as one unit) move into their new home, conflicts are down-to-earth and domestic until Martin Snr finds an old dollhouse in the shed that just happens to be the spitting image of the infamous residence in Long Island. As soon as the replica is brought into the house, things begin to go pear-shaped. Household appliances take on a life of their own, people start having bad dreams, and Jimmy, the youngest son, begins to see the rotting animated corpse of his dead birth father. Will everyone realise the cause of the disturbances in time, or will they all succumb to the evil designs of the dollhouse? Amityville VIII, unlike its predecessors, makes no attempt to tie its plot in with the source material. No references are made to the DeFeo murders, demonic possession, or even the house itself. The only connection is the obvious visual link with the Dutch-colonial dollhouse, whose origins are never explored. It's as if the producers are saying 'Look, it's straight-to-video, you know the story, no-one will be watching who doesn't.' However, putting aside the very obvious question regarding where the dollhouse came from and what connection - if any - it has to the actual Amityville house, the story follows the familiar structure of its predecessors: characters possessed by demonic forces, unexplainable local phenomena and even killer insects. Also present is that same sense of deja vu, wherein you once again know you're watching a generic horror film with the word 'Amityville' stamped on it. To expect a lot at this stage however, after even the recycled ideas have been recycled, would be asking too much. This latest retreading still manages to be entertaining and not without its moments, and the actors present give convincing enough performances with the material handed to them. Compared with other entries in the series,the horror elements here are lower in tone, and the death scenes few and far between. There are a few dodgy monster moments, which while tied into the plot, aren't realised with the kind of budget that would do them justice, and the prosthetics only just about work. Overall however, the story follows its own internal logic well enough not to cause irritation and so long as you don't try to integrate it into the Amityville universe, it's an entertaining enough 90 minutes. I have to say that watching every Amityville in the series has been torturously painful at times, sometimes making me wonder why I'm a sucker for B-grade horror. However, there have been some notable entries as well, with 1992's 'It's About Time' probably the most imaginative. 'Dollhouse' is a less ambitious rehashing of the formula, but it stands above the real clankers, enough to not leave a bitter aftertaste.

    "Amityville Dollhouse" is Part 8 in the "Amityville Saga" and I saw them all last week. So let's look back at all of them.. "The Amityville Horror" (1979): Still a classic like "The Shining" and "Poltergeist". A scary story based on true events with solid performances by James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger. After 30 years, it's still a strong movie and not outdated at all. "Amityville II: The Possession" (1982): A Very good sequel, not as strong as the original because it has it's flaws. The last 20 minutes is a bit too much a rip-off of "The Exorcist". But once again, scary with a good cast (Burt Young from the "Rocky" films) and it was daring to put the incest element in the plot, but it works very well to it's advantage. "Amityville 3D: The Demon" (1983) : After the success of the second one, quickly produced again by Dino DeLaurentius. The first weak entry in the series, not scary with a weak ending and poor effects. "Amityville Horror: The Evil Escapes" (1989) : One of the worst, with a stupid plot: an ugly lamp from the original house (that was blown up at the end of Part 3, so what the hell ?) holds the demon that terrorizes a new family. Made-For-TV movie that comes off very cheap. "The Amityville Curse" (1990) : Another bad TV-movie, many reviews say this is the worst but at least there is some horror at the end. It's not PG-13 stuff like the previous two and it has Kim Coates. But he can't save the dull story that goes absolutely nowhere. "Amityville 1992: It's About Time" (1992) : The best of all sequels besides the second part. This time, directed by Tony Randell (Hellbound: Hellraiser II, Ticks). With once again a decent score (Daniel Licht) and an entertaining story. This was actually based on the same novel as the fourth one (Amityville: The Evil Escapes) but it's way better !! "Amityville: A New Generation" (1993) : A good cast but overall not a very convincing story. David Naughton (An American Werewolf In London), Terry O'Quinn (The Stepfather, TV's Lost) and Julia Nickson (Rambo: First Blood Part II): Nice to see them again. But that's the only good thing, this is certainly not one of the worst sequels, but that does not mean it's a really good genre movie. "Amityville Dollhouse" (1996) : The eight movie with once again something from the original house. Not a lamp, not a clock but this time a dollhouse which is in fact the model of the original house from Part 1. Hardly original, the girl looks a lot like the one from "Poltergeist" (just look at the poster, not badly done..) and the demons at the end do remind you of the ending of "Hellraiser". But this time they're not scary at all. Those special make-up effects are not convincing. But there is one good thing: the make-up effects used for the zombie soldier are very well done. But once again, not original because they stole that from "House" (1986). Not scary, not convincing, unfortunately another weak entry in the series. Luckily, the stopped making sequels after that one. In 2005 the remake of the original one was released with Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George. I have to say that it's certainly not as good as the original, but looking at the sequels, it's the best "Amityville" since part 2.

    Don't ask me what encouraged me to re-watch this. Can't really explain it myself. I guess I just wanted to see if I thought it was still "okay" (as that was what I seemed to remember about it from my 90's viewing). And I guess it probably is "okay", though it feels kind of wrong to say it. Because AMITYVILLE: DOLLHOUSE seems as good an example as many, to show why horror was going the wrong way during the 90's: It's just too unimaginative, formulaic and generic. It basically fails to impress. We got a new family moving into a new house (Starr Andreeff might actually be a reason for some to watch this -- I myself was kind of pleased that at least she was in it). Daddy finds a dollhouse in the backyard shack and gives it to his daughter -- and since we've seen all the previous Amityville-installments, we can only guess that the toy house is a vessel inhabited by the Amityville-evil. And the evil manifests itself in many ways (at least there's some variety in these matters), which soon becomes too routinely. Best one of these manifestations is probably a dead & rotten ghost-daddy coming back from the grave, playing his evil tricks. There's a somewhat interesting subplot about the history of the house, once destroyed in a fire, but not much is done with it. It's basically family-stuff going on in some scenes (presumably to give the characters some depth), mixed with supernatural happenings on which you can set a timer (that's how routinely it all plays out). And by the time the climax comes around - featuring a dimensional-portal through a fireplace, two pitchfork-wielding demons (doing nothing more than just that) and some master-devil-dude-puppet with wings that don't fly - it's just too little, too late. AMITYVILLE: DOLLHOUSE might be pleasing for undemanding horror fans growing up in the 90's, and it's far from the worst horror movie you'll ever see. But it doesn't hold a candle to most other sequels from other franchises being cranked out at the time (and even before its straight-to-video release). On the upside: It didn't get any worse after 1993's AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION and it does sort of have the same vibe as AMITYVILLE: IT'S ABOUT TIME. In fact, all three movies are about on par with each other. Does that say anything? I thought of a plea for abating circumstances, when it comes to this installment... but only a little more, a little sooner would have gained it an extra point.

    (Plot) A children's doll house is eerily reminiscent of the house in most of the Amityville movies. A girl winds up with the miniature house and somehow evil commences. I cannot begin to comprehend how so many of these blasted films got made. I didn't even care for the original movie that much. It was dull and overlong, so who in there right mind thought we deserved all this needless suffering?! This one has some unintentional laughs. Jimmy's (Clayton Murray) dead Father is conjured up by the demon. Not only is the makeup absolutely laughable, but I couldn't understand something. How did it take the kid so long to realize his Father wasn't who he said he was? I get that kids are gullible, but that was a bit much for me. The Martin family isn't all that likable in all honesty, and I didn't feel any suspense, just 90 minutes or so of god awful movie making, and boredom. Final Thoughts: There are two horror series which committed unspeakable sins Amityville Horror & Children of The Corn; what did they both have in common? An endless string of terrible DTV sequels and this is one of those sequels. Leave it alone where it belongs 1/10

    The 'Amityville' series grinds on with this witless entry in which a family discover an old dollhouse in the garage of their new home, leading to the usual spooky problems and the usual lack of engagement. Aside from a couple of promising bits and pieces (the stepmom's crush, or the doll coming to life) the familiar story flops in some amazingly predictable directions (like the kid who wishes he could see his dead father, you know the rest) while the obligatory witchcraft experts are on hand to explain everything to the characters and the audience. We're also treated to such ripe dialogue as, 'If it's a portal... it's the welcome mat to Hell' and my personal favourite, 'Tamazarak... samahak... athofamalos, you bastards!!'. Cack.

    Evil can be found in the most unlikely of places. Normally in movies it's found in a house or a person. Other times it's animals or dolls that have somehow gone bad. Inanimate objects coming to life to kill is a pretty scary idea. It's been done effectively, but often times it's a missed opportunity. 'Amityville' parts 4, 6 and 7 all dealt with objects from the cursed dwelling terrorizing new victims. This eighth chapter continues this tradition and isn't too bad. Pros: Decent acting. Suspenseful. Effective score. Nice job on the make-up and special effects. Some neat ideas. Never dull. Feeling of doom hangs over the film. Cons: Not much plot. Nothing we haven't already seen. Pace drags a bit. Lacking scares. Final thoughts: The original 'Amityville Horror' was a success in it's time. However, I don't think anyone imagined there be so many sequels. Though not one of the best, 'Amityville Dollhouse' is a lot better than it should be. Would really do the trick on a rainy afternoon or evening. My rating: 3/5

    Amityville: Dollhouse (1996) * (out of 4) Silly eighth entry in the original series has a husband moving his son and daughter into a house he built with his new wife and her son. None of the kids like the other parent but things take a turn for the worse when daddy finds an old dollhouse in a shed, which just happens to be a replica of the Amityville house. Soon enough all sorts of weird things begin to happen and of course no one thinks about destroying the dollhouse. AMITYVILLE: DOLLHOUSE is yet another direct-to-video cash-in on the original series and I guess the producers knew it was such a turkey that they didn't even try to make another one. This is a pretty bad film on many levels but unlike some of the other rip-offs (like AMITHVILLE: IT'S ABOUT TIME), this one here doesn't work on any level. Most of these sequels had little to nothing to do with the original film but it's clear the title Amityville meant rentals so we had all sorts of strange stories made up with that title added. There's very little working for this movie but at least the creatures at the very end look pretty good. Outside of that it's your typical low-budget horror movie with bland performances, a bad story and just nothing exciting going on. The death scenes are all laughable and just wait until you see the giant mouse that shows up.

    Bill Martin (Robin Thomas) and his new wife Claire (Starr Andreeff) move into the new house he built in the California mountains. In a shed outback he finds a cute little dollhouse designed just like the famous Amityville, NY abode. How this got here or who built it is never explained. This is no Barbie Dream House though as this dollhouse crushes Bill's gift bike for his daughter's birthday and the parents resort to the "this should make a great gift" routine. The eighth and final Amityville flick before they did the remake. After part 3, the producers felt they could circumvent the whole Amityville house thing by having various possessed items from the house be the gateway to terror. So we had a lamp (AMITYVILLE: THE EVIL ESCAPES), a confessional (THE AMITYVILLE CURSE), a clock (AMITYVILLE: IT'S ABOUT TIME) and a mirror (AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION). So I guess a dollhouse isn't that ridiculous. This is actually a two-for-one deal as we get a possessed recycled fireplace too (there is general confusion as the house was built on foundation of an old house that blew up to suggest it was the Amityville house, but this is clearly set in California). I'm just glad they stopped with this one or we would have ended up with the likes of possessed toaster in AMITYVILLE: YOU'RE TOAST. Or an evil stove in AMITYVILLE: YOUR BLOOD BOILS. One thing this sequel does that is surprising is bring back the taboo sex angle from part 2, along they play it a bit safer with the stepmom lusting for the stepson. Other than that, it is pretty routine stuff with the occasional cool effect here and there (like the progressively rotting dad who haunts his young son a la John Landis' werewolf classic).

    "Amityville Dollhouse" is Part 8 in the "Amityville Saga" and I saw them all last week. So let's look back at all of them.. "The Amityville Horror" (1979): Still a classic like "The Shining" and "Poltergeist". A scary story based on true events with solid performances by James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger. After 30 years, it's still a strong movie and not outdated at all. "Amityville II: The Possession" (1982): A Very good sequel, not as strong as the original because it has it's flaws. The last 20 minutes is a bit too much a rip-off of "The Exorcist". But once again, scary with a good cast (Burt Young from the "Rocky" films) and it was daring to put the incest element in the plot, but it works very well to it's advantage. "Amityville 3D: The Demon" (1983) : After the success of the second one, quickly produced again by Dino DeLaurentius. The first weak entry in the series, not scary with a weak ending and poor effects. "Amityville Horror: The Evil Escapes" (1989) : One of the worst, with a stupid plot: an ugly lamp from the original house (that was blown up at the end of Part 3, so what the hell ?) holds the demon that terrorizes a new family.

With once again a decent score (Daniel Licht) and an entertaining story. This was actually based on the same novel as the fourth one (Amityville: The Evil Escapes) but it's way better !! "Amityville: A New Generation" (1993) : A good cast but overall not a very convincing story.

But that's the only good thing, this is certainly not one of the worst sequels, but that does not mean it's a really good genre movie. "Amityville Dollhouse" (1996) : The eight movie with once again something from the original house. Not a lamp, not a clock but this time a dollhouse which is in fact the model of the original house from Part 1. Hardly original, the girl looks a lot like the one from "Poltergeist" (just look at the poster, not badly done..) and the demons at the end do remind you of the ending of "Hellraiser". But this time they're not scary at all. Those special make-up effects are not convincing. But there is one good thing: the make-up effects used for the zombie soldier are very well done. But once again, not original because they stole that from "House" (1986). Not scary, not convincing, unfortunately another weak entry in the series. Luckily, the stopped making sequels after that one. In 2005 the remake of the original one was released with Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George. I have to say that it's certainly not as good as the original, but looking at the sequels, it's the best "Amityville" since part 2.

    Don't ask me what encouraged me to re-watch this. Can't really explain it myself. I guess I just wanted to see if I thought it was still "okay" (as that was what I seemed to remember about it from my 90's viewing). And I guess it probably is "okay", though it feels kind of wrong to say it. Because AMITYVILLE: DOLLHOUSE seems as good an example as many, to show why horror was going the wrong way during the 90's: It's just too unimaginative, formulaic and generic. It basically fails to impress. We got a new family moving into a new house (Starr Andreeff might actually be a reason for some to watch this -- I myself was kind of pleased that at least she was in it). Daddy finds a dollhouse in the backyard shack and gives it to his daughter -- and since we've seen all the previous Amityville-installments, we can only guess that the toy house is a vessel inhabited by the Amityville-evil. And the evil manifests itself in many ways (at least there's some variety in these matters), which soon becomes too routinely. Best one of these manifestations is probably a dead & rotten ghost-daddy coming back from the grave, playing his evil tricks. There's a somewhat interesting subplot about the history of the house, once destroyed in a fire, but not much is done with it. It's basically family-stuff going on in some scenes (presumably to give the characters some depth), mixed with supernatural happenings on which you can set a timer (that's how routinely it all plays out). And by the time the climax comes around - featuring a dimensional-portal through a fireplace, two pitchfork-wielding demons (doing nothing more than just that) and some master-devil-dude-puppet with wings that don't fly - it's just too little, too late. AMITYVILLE: DOLLHOUSE might be pleasing for undemanding horror fans growing up in the 90's, and it's far from the worst horror movie you'll ever see. But it doesn't hold a candle to most other sequels from other franchises being cranked out at the time (and even before its straight-to-video release). On the upside: It didn't get any worse after 1993's AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION and it does sort of have the same vibe as AMITYVILLE: IT'S ABOUT TIME. In fact, all three movies are about on par with each other. Does that say anything? I thought of a plea for abating circumstances, when it comes to this installment... but only a little more, a little sooner would have gained it an extra point.

    (Plot) A children's doll house is eerily reminiscent of the house in most of the Amityville movies. A girl winds up with the miniature house and somehow evil commences. I cannot begin to comprehend how so many of these blasted films got made. I didn't even care for the original movie that much. It was dull and overlong, so who in there right mind thought we deserved all this needless suffering?! This one has some unintentional laughs. Jimmy's (Clayton Murray) dead Father is conjured up by the demon. Not only is the makeup absolutely laughable, but I couldn't understand something. How did it take the kid so long to realize his Father wasn't who he said he was? I get that kids are gullible, but that was a bit much for me. The Martin family isn't all that likable in all honesty, and I didn't feel any suspense, just 90 minutes or so of god awful movie making, and boredom. Final Thoughts: There are two horror series which committed unspeakable sins Amityville Horror & Children of The Corn; what did they both have in common? An endless string of terrible DTV sequels and this is one of those sequels. Leave it alone where it belongs 1/10

    The 'Amityville' series grinds on with this witless entry in which a family discover an old dollhouse in the garage of their new home, leading to the usual spooky problems and the usual lack of engagement. Aside from a couple of promising bits and pieces (the stepmom's crush, or the doll coming to life) the familiar story flops in some amazingly predictable directions (like the kid who wishes he could see his dead father, you know the rest) while the obligatory witchcraft experts are on hand to explain everything to the characters and the audience. We're also treated to such ripe dialogue as, 'If it's a portal... it's the welcome mat to Hell' and my personal favourite, 'Tamazarak... samahak... athofamalos, you bastards!!'. Cack.

    Evil can be found in the most unlikely of places. Normally in movies it's found in a house or a person. Other times it's animals or dolls that have somehow gone bad. Inanimate objects coming to life to kill is a pretty scary idea. It's been done effectively, but often times it's a missed opportunity. 'Amityville' parts 4, 6 and 7 all dealt with objects from the cursed dwelling terrorizing new victims. This eighth chapter continues this tradition and isn't too bad. Pros: Decent acting. Suspenseful. Effective score. Nice job on the make-up and special effects. Some neat ideas. Never dull. Feeling of doom hangs over the film. Cons: Not much plot. Nothing we haven't already seen. Pace drags a bit. Lacking scares. Final thoughts: The original 'Amityville Horror' was a success in it's time. However, I don't think anyone imagined there be so many sequels. Though not one of the best, 'Amityville Dollhouse' is a lot better than it should be. Would really do the trick on a rainy afternoon or evening. My rating: 3/5

    Amityville: Dollhouse (1996) * (out of 4) Silly eighth entry in the original series has a husband moving his son and daughter into a house he built with his new wife and her son. None of the kids like the other parent but things take a turn for the worse when daddy finds an old dollhouse in a shed, which just happens to be a replica of the Amityville house. Soon enough all sorts of weird things begin to happen and of course no one thinks about destroying the dollhouse. AMITYVILLE: DOLLHOUSE is yet another direct-to-video cash-in on the original series and I guess the producers knew it was such a turkey that they didn't even try to make another one. This is a pretty bad film on many levels but unlike some of the other rip-offs (like AMITHVILLE: IT'S ABOUT TIME), this one here doesn't work on any level. Most of these sequels had little to nothing to do with the original film but it's clear the title Amityville meant rentals so we had all sorts of strange stories made up with that title added. There's very little working for this movie but at least the creatures at the very end look pretty good. Outside of that it's your typical low-budget horror movie with bland performances, a bad story and just nothing exciting going on. The death scenes are all laughable and just wait until you see the giant mouse that shows up.

    Bill Martin (Robin Thomas) and his new wife Claire (Starr Andreeff) move into the new house he built in the California mountains. In a shed outback he finds a cute little dollhouse designed just like the famous Amityville, NY abode. How this got here or who built it is never explained. This is no Barbie Dream House though as this dollhouse crushes Bill's gift bike for his daughter's birthday and the parents resort to the "this should make a great gift" routine. The eighth and final Amityville flick before they did the remake. After part 3, the producers felt they could circumvent the whole Amityville house thing by having various possessed items from the house be the gateway to terror. So we had a lamp (AMITYVILLE: THE EVIL ESCAPES), a confessional (THE AMITYVILLE CURSE), a clock (AMITYVILLE: IT'S ABOUT TIME) and a mirror (AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION). So I guess a dollhouse isn't that ridiculous. This is actually a two-for-one deal as we get a possessed recycled fireplace too (there is general confusion as the house was built on foundation of an old house that blew up to suggest it was the Amityville house, but this is clearly set in California). I'm just glad they stopped with this one or we would have ended up with the likes of possessed toaster in AMITYVILLE: YOU'RE TOAST. Or an evil stove in AMITYVILLE: YOUR BLOOD BOILS. One thing this sequel does that is surprising is bring back the taboo sex angle from part 2, along they play it a bit safer with the stepmom lusting for the stepson. Other than that, it is pretty routine stuff with the occasional cool effect here and there (like the progressively rotting dad who haunts his young son a la John Landis' werewolf classic).

    Amityville Dollhouse is the 8th installment in this long drawn out series. This one is actually pretty decent. It's about a man who finds a dollhouse which looks exactly like the Amityville house. As soon as he gives the dollhouse to his daughter for her birthday, strange things start to happen. The fireplace turns on and off, windows open and close by themselves, a gigantic mouse hides under a bed, and the man's wife gets the hots for her teenage stepson. Classic signs in Amityville sequels that something just isn't right. What irritates me is that the young girl and her aunt realize there is something evil about the dollhouse, but do not destroy it right away. Instead, they think it's best if the little girl writes down all of the strange things that happen with regards to the dollhouse. There are some cool scares and sequences in the movie. The gigantic mouse scene is well done, the bug in the ear is cringe worthy, and the younger son's deceased father coming back from the dead is pretty creepy. Overall, this is one of the better Amityville sequels. The story goes on at a good pace and is never dull or tedious. The only downfall like many other of the Amityville sequels is that it has almost nothing to do with Amityville - other than the replica dollhouse. It's hard to get on DVD, but if you can, check this one out. 6/10

    This family have just moved into a normal house, this family has a mother named Claire who as one son called Jimmy , Claire is Married to Bill who has daughter Jessica and she as a older brother Todd but Jimmy (who is very annoying) dose not seem to like his step family, however the other do like like then step-mum. When Bill goes to the shed he find the doll house that is the Amityville House. Soom strange thinks start to happen in the house, the haunted doll house break the daughter bike they were going to give her for her Birthday so they end up giving the doll house instead but she soon finds out that the doll house is evil. Jimmy is also affected by evil force as they got his dad back from the dead to see him, at first his happy to see his dead dad that look like a Zombie but soon starts to get scared of him as he think he dead dad is going kill step dad. My favourite scene is this movie as to be when Jimmy Mouse goes to Jessica room and enter the doll house and as the mouse goes in the doll house goes under the bed in that in the doll house and then Jessica bed starts shake and she see an enormous white mouse appears under her bed. I really liked that scenes it was really well made, I enjoyed that scene and the whole movie, it was very entertaining from start to the end and it was not boring or predictable like previous movies at all. I liked the way the the movie ended and acting great in this movie. I am going to give this movie 8 out of 10

    The Amityville Horror: in the real world, it's about a young man brutally murdering his family one night on a drug-fuelled rampage. In the world of film and fantasy, it's about demons in the cellar, possession, evil lamps, sinister clocks and unnecessary 3D. The film franchise has had a long life and some of the installments have been - and let's be kind here - god-awful. 'Dollhouse' was the very final installment before someone turned back the clock with the 2005 reboot, and having watched every single Amityville thus far made, I can honestly say it's not the worst. No, for that, we have to go back to 1992 for the pain and misery that is 'The Amityville Possession'. Many of the sequels would spin a yarn from an artifact removed from the Long Island house that would then raise hell in a new setting. In 'Dollhouse', the house itself is an artifact in miniature. When the Martins, a dysfunctional Brady-style family (two single parents and their kids coming together as one unit) move into their new home, conflicts are down-to-earth and domestic until Martin Snr finds an old dollhouse in the shed that just happens to be the spitting image of the infamous residence in Long Island. As soon as the replica is brought into the house, things begin to go pear-shaped. Household appliances take on a life of their own, people start having bad dreams, and Jimmy, the youngest son, begins to see the rotting animated corpse of his dead birth father. Will everyone realise the cause of the disturbances in time, or will they all succumb to the evil designs of the dollhouse? Amityville VIII, unlike its predecessors, makes no attempt to tie its plot in with the source material. No references are made to the DeFeo murders, demonic possession, or even the house itself. The only connection is the obvious visual link with the Dutch-colonial dollhouse, whose origins are never explored. It's as if the producers are saying 'Look, it's straight-to-video, you know the story, no-one will be watching who doesn't.' However, putting aside the very obvious question regarding where the dollhouse came from and what connection - if any - it has to the actual Amityville house, the story follows the familiar structure of its predecessors: characters possessed by demonic forces, unexplainable local phenomena and even killer insects. Also present is that same sense of deja vu, wherein you once again know you're watching a generic horror film with the word 'Amityville' stamped on it. To expect a lot at this stage however, after even the recycled ideas have been recycled, would be asking too much. This latest retreading still manages to be entertaining and not without its moments, and the actors present give convincing enough performances with the material handed to them. Compared with other entries in the series,the horror elements here are lower in tone, and the death scenes few and far between. There are a few dodgy monster moments, which while tied into the plot, aren't realised with the kind of budget that would do them justice, and the prosthetics only just about work. Overall however, the story follows its own internal logic well enough not to cause irritation and so long as you don't try to integrate it into the Amityville universe, it's an entertaining enough 90 minutes. I have to say that watching every Amityville in the series has been torturously painful at times, sometimes making me wonder why I'm a sucker for B-grade horror. However, there have been some notable entries as well, with 1992's 'It's About Time' probably the most imaginative. 'Dollhouse' is a less ambitious rehashing of the formula, but it stands above the real clankers, enough to not leave a bitter aftertaste.

    "Amityville Dollhouse" is Part 8 in the "Amityville Saga" and I saw them all last week. So let's look back at all of them.. "The Amityville Horror" (1979): Still a classic like "The Shining" and "Poltergeist". A scary story based on true events with solid performances by James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger. After 30 years, it's still a strong movie and not outdated at all. "Amityville II: The Possession" (1982): A Very good sequel, not as strong as the original because it has it's flaws. The last 20 minutes is a bit too much a rip-off of "The Exorcist". But once again, scary with a good cast (Burt Young from the "Rocky" films) and it was daring to put the incest element in the plot, but it works very well to it's advantage. "Amityville 3D: The Demon" (1983) : After the success of the second one, quickly produced again by Dino DeLaurentius. The first weak entry in the series, not scary with a weak ending and poor effects. "Amityville Horror: The Evil Escapes" (1989) : One of the worst, with a stupid plot: an ugly lamp from the original house (that was blown up at the end of Part 3, so what the hell ?) holds the demon that terrorizes a new family. Made-For-TV movie that comes off very cheap. "The Amityville Curse" (1990) : Another bad TV-movie, many reviews say this is the worst but at least there is some horror at the end. It's not PG-13 stuff like the previous two and it has Kim Coates. But he can't save the dull story that goes absolutely nowhere. "Amityville 1992: It's About Time" (1992) : The best of all sequels besides the second part. This time, directed by Tony Randell (Hellbound: Hellraiser II, Ticks). With once again a decent score (Daniel Licht) and an entertaining story. This was actually based on the same novel as the fourth one (Amityville: The Evil Escapes) but it's way better !! "Amityville: A New Generation" (1993) : A good cast but overall not a very convincing story. David Naughton (An American Werewolf In London), Terry O'Quinn (The Stepfather, TV's Lost) and Julia Nickson (Rambo: First Blood Part II): Nice to see them again. But that's the only good thing, this is certainly not one of the worst sequels, but that does not mean it's a really good genre movie. "Amityville Dollhouse" (1996) : The eight movie with once again something from the original house. Not a lamp, not a clock but this time a dollhouse which is in fact the model of the original house from Part 1. Hardly original, the girl looks a lot like the one from "Poltergeist" (just look at the poster, not badly done..) and the demons at the end do remind you of the ending of "Hellraiser". But this time they're not scary at all. Those special make-up effects are not convincing. But there is one good thing: the make-up effects used for the zombie soldier are very well done. But once again, not original because they stole that from "House" (1986). Not scary, not convincing, unfortunately another weak entry in the series. Luckily, the stopped making sequels after that one. In 2005 the remake of the original one was released with Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George. I have to say that it's certainly not as good as the original, but looking at the sequels, it's the best "Amityville" since part 2.

After part 3, the producers felt they could circumvent the whole Amityville house thing by having various possessed items from the house be the gateway to terror. So we had a lamp (AMITYVILLE: THE EVIL ESCAPES), a confessional (THE AMITYVILLE CURSE), a clock (AMITYVILLE: IT'S ABOUT TIME) and a mirror (AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION). So I guess a dollhouse isn't that ridiculous. This is actually a two-for-one deal as we get a possessed recycled fireplace too (there is general confusion as the house was built on foundation of an old house that blew up to suggest it was the Amityville house, but this is clearly set in California). I'm just glad they stopped with this one or we would have ended up with the likes of possessed toaster in AMITYVILLE: YOU'RE TOAST. Or an evil stove in AMITYVILLE: YOUR BLOOD BOILS. One thing this sequel does that is surprising is bring back the taboo sex angle from part 2, along they play it a bit safer with the stepmom lusting for the stepson. Other than that, it is pretty routine stuff with the occasional cool effect here and there (like the progressively rotting dad who haunts his young son a la John Landis' werewolf classic).

    Amityville Dollhouse is the 8th installment in this long drawn out series. This one is actually pretty decent. It's about a man who finds a dollhouse which looks exactly like the Amityville house. As soon as he gives the dollhouse to his daughter for her birthday, strange things start to happen. The fireplace turns on and off, windows open and close by themselves, a gigantic mouse hides under a bed, and the man's wife gets the hots for her teenage stepson. Classic signs in Amityville sequels that something just isn't right. What irritates me is that the young girl and her aunt realize there is something evil about the dollhouse, but do not destroy it right away. Instead, they think it's best if the little girl writes down all of the strange things that happen with regards to the dollhouse. There are some cool scares and sequences in the movie. The gigantic mouse scene is well done, the bug in the ear is cringe worthy, and the younger son's deceased father coming back from the dead is pretty creepy. Overall, this is one of the better Amityville sequels. The story goes on at a good pace and is never dull or tedious. The only downfall like many other of the Amityville sequels is that it has almost nothing to do with Amityville - other than the replica dollhouse. It's hard to get on DVD, but if you can, check this one out. 6/10

    This family have just moved into a normal house, this family has a mother named Claire who as one son called Jimmy , Claire is Married to Bill who has daughter Jessica and she as a older brother Todd but Jimmy (who is very annoying) dose not seem to like his step family, however the other do like like then step-mum. When Bill goes to the shed he find the doll house that is the Amityville House. Soom strange thinks start to happen in the house, the haunted doll house break the daughter bike they were going to give her for her Birthday so they end up giving the doll house instead but she soon finds out that the doll house is evil. Jimmy is also affected by evil force as they got his dad back from the dead to see him, at first his happy to see his dead dad that look like a Zombie but soon starts to get scared of him as he think he dead dad is going kill step dad. My favourite scene is this movie as to be when Jimmy Mouse goes to Jessica room and enter the doll house and as the mouse goes in the doll house goes under the bed in that in the doll house and then Jessica bed starts shake and she see an enormous white mouse appears under her bed. I really liked that scenes it was really well made, I enjoyed that scene and the whole movie, it was very entertaining from start to the end and it was not boring or predictable like previous movies at all. I liked the way the the movie ended and acting great in this movie. I am going to give this movie 8 out of 10

    The Amityville Horror: in the real world, it's about a young man brutally murdering his family one night on a drug-fuelled rampage. In the world of film and fantasy, it's about demons in the cellar, possession, evil lamps, sinister clocks and unnecessary 3D. The film franchise has had a long life and some of the installments have been - and let's be kind here - god-awful. 'Dollhouse' was the very final installment before someone turned back the clock with the 2005 reboot, and having watched every single Amityville thus far made, I can honestly say it's not the worst. No, for that, we have to go back to 1992 for the pain and misery that is 'The Amityville Possession'. Many of the sequels would spin a yarn from an artifact removed from the Long Island house that would then raise hell in a new setting. In 'Dollhouse', the house itself is an artifact in miniature. When the Martins, a dysfunctional Brady-style family (two single parents and their kids coming together as one unit) move into their new home, conflicts are down-to-earth and domestic until Martin Snr finds an old dollhouse in the shed that just happens to be the spitting image of the infamous residence in Long Island. As soon as the replica is brought into the house, things begin to go pear-shaped. Household appliances take on a life of their own, people start having bad dreams, and Jimmy, the youngest son, begins to see the rotting animated corpse of his dead birth father. Will everyone realise the cause of the disturbances in time, or will they all succumb to the evil designs of the dollhouse? Amityville VIII, unlike its predecessors, makes no attempt to tie its plot in with the source material. No references are made to the DeFeo murders, demonic possession, or even the house itself. The only connection is the obvious visual link with the Dutch-colonial dollhouse, whose origins are never explored. It's as if the producers are saying 'Look, it's straight-to-video, you know the story, no-one will be watching who doesn't.' However, putting aside the very obvious question regarding where the dollhouse came from and what connection - if any - it has to the actual Amityville house, the story follows the familiar structure of its predecessors: characters possessed by demonic forces, unexplainable local phenomena and even killer insects. Also present is that same sense of deja vu, wherein you once again know you're watching a generic horror film with the word 'Amityville' stamped on it. To expect a lot at this stage however, after even the recycled ideas have been recycled, would be asking too much. This latest retreading still manages to be entertaining and not without its moments, and the actors present give convincing enough performances with the material handed to them. Compared with other entries in the series,the horror elements here are lower in tone, and the death scenes few and far between. There are a few dodgy monster moments, which while tied into the plot, aren't realised with the kind of budget that would do them justice, and the prosthetics only just about work. Overall however, the story follows its own internal logic well enough not to cause irritation and so long as you don't try to integrate it into the Amityville universe, it's an entertaining enough 90 minutes. I have to say that watching every Amityville in the series has been torturously painful at times, sometimes making me wonder why I'm a sucker for B-grade horror. However, there have been some notable entries as well, with 1992's 'It's About Time' probably the most imaginative. 'Dollhouse' is a less ambitious rehashing of the formula, but it stands above the real clankers, enough to not leave a bitter aftertaste.

    "Amityville Dollhouse" is Part 8 in the "Amityville Saga" and I saw them all last week. So let's look back at all of them.. "The Amityville Horror" (1979): Still a classic like "The Shining" and "Poltergeist". A scary story based on true events with solid performances by James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger. After 30 years, it's still a strong movie and not outdated at all. "Amityville II: The Possession" (1982): A Very good sequel, not as strong as the original because it has it's flaws. The last 20 minutes is a bit too much a rip-off of "The Exorcist". But once again, scary with a good cast (Burt Young from the "Rocky" films) and it was daring to put the incest element in the plot, but it works very well to it's advantage. "Amityville 3D: The Demon" (1983) : After the success of the second one, quickly produced again by Dino DeLaurentius. The first weak entry in the series, not scary with a weak ending and poor effects. "Amityville Horror: The Evil Escapes" (1989) : One of the worst, with a stupid plot: an ugly lamp from the original house (that was blown up at the end of Part 3, so what the hell ?) holds the demon that terrorizes a new family. Made-For-TV movie that comes off very cheap. "The Amityville Curse" (1990) : Another bad TV-movie, many reviews say this is the worst but at least there is some horror at the end. It's not PG-13 stuff like the previous two and it has Kim Coates. But he can't save the dull story that goes absolutely nowhere. "Amityville 1992: It's About Time" (1992) : The best of all sequels besides the second part. This time, directed by Tony Randell (Hellbound: Hellraiser II, Ticks). With once again a decent score (Daniel Licht) and an entertaining story. This was actually based on the same novel as the fourth one (Amityville: The Evil Escapes) but it's way better !! "Amityville: A New Generation" (1993) : A good cast but overall not a very convincing story. David Naughton (An American Werewolf In London), Terry O'Quinn (The Stepfather, TV's Lost) and Julia Nickson (Rambo: First Blood Part II): Nice to see them again. But that's the only good thing, this is certainly not one of the worst sequels, but that does not mean it's a really good genre movie. "Amityville Dollhouse" (1996) : The eight movie with once again something from the original house. Not a lamp, not a clock but this time a dollhouse which is in fact the model of the original house from Part 1. Hardly original, the girl looks a lot like the one from "Poltergeist" (just look at the poster, not badly done..) and the demons at the end do remind you of the ending of "Hellraiser". But this time they're not scary at all. Those special make-up effects are not convincing. But there is one good thing: the make-up effects used for the zombie soldier are very well done. But once again, not original because they stole that from "House" (1986). Not scary, not convincing, unfortunately another weak entry in the series. Luckily, the stopped making sequels after that one. In 2005 the remake of the original one was released with Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George. I have to say that it's certainly not as good as the original, but looking at the sequels, it's the best "Amityville" since part 2.

    Don't ask me what encouraged me to re-watch this. Can't really explain it myself. I guess I just wanted to see if I thought it was still "okay" (as that was what I seemed to remember about it from my 90's viewing). And I guess it probably is "okay", though it feels kind of wrong to say it. Because AMITYVILLE: DOLLHOUSE seems as good an example as many, to show why horror was going the wrong way during the 90's: It's just too unimaginative, formulaic and generic. It basically fails to impress. We got a new family moving into a new house (Starr Andreeff might actually be a reason for some to watch this -- I myself was kind of pleased that at least she was in it). Daddy finds a dollhouse in the backyard shack and gives it to his daughter -- and since we've seen all the previous Amityville-installments, we can only guess that the toy house is a vessel inhabited by the Amityville-evil. And the evil manifests itself in many ways (at least there's some variety in these matters), which soon becomes too routinely. Best one of these manifestations is probably a dead & rotten ghost-daddy coming back from the grave, playing his evil tricks. There's a somewhat interesting subplot about the history of the house, once destroyed in a fire, but not much is done with it. It's basically family-stuff going on in some scenes (presumably to give the characters some depth), mixed with supernatural happenings on which you can set a timer (that's how routinely it all plays out). And by the time the climax comes around - featuring a dimensional-portal through a fireplace, two pitchfork-wielding demons (doing nothing more than just that) and some master-devil-dude-puppet with wings that don't fly - it's just too little, too late. AMITYVILLE: DOLLHOUSE might be pleasing for undemanding horror fans growing up in the 90's, and it's far from the worst horror movie you'll ever see. But it doesn't hold a candle to most other sequels from other franchises being cranked out at the time (and even before its straight-to-video release). On the upside: It didn't get any worse after 1993's AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION and it does sort of have the same vibe as AMITYVILLE: IT'S ABOUT TIME. In fact, all three movies are about on par with each other. Does that say anything? I thought of a plea for abating circumstances, when it comes to this installment... but only a little more, a little sooner would have gained it an extra point.
