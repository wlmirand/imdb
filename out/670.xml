    Acceptable Sci-Fi picture which achieved a moderated success on its appearance and dealing with a teenage girl and her father discover alien clones are replacing humans on a remote U.S. military base in Alabama . This is a passable rendition starred by a good cast such as Forest Whitaker , Meg Tilly, Terry Kinney and Gabriella Anwar . It is an average budget version , though sometimes slow-paced and including some jolts of horror . Science Fiction , military and fantasy is presented in its most horrifying form . A genuinely frightening , chilling exercise in nightmare dislocation in which hideous creatures from outer space arrive on Earth with plans of conquest by means of pods and being freely based upon a novel by Jack Finney . There are not monsters only the residents of a military headquarter , as their wills , minds and bodies taken over by a weird form of life from outer space . This is the third adaptation , still very scary and creepy about a vintage novel deals with some military residents who are being replaced by duplicates hatched from weird pods . It creates an altering the human behaviour in the new invaders . As a doctor (Terry Kinney) must protect his daughter (significant role for gorgeous Gabriella Anwar) and her new stepmother (Meg Tilly), and soon aware that pods from outer space are duplicating and menacing everyone there . Meantime , the teenager daughter befriends a handsome attack helicopter pilot, Tim Young (Billy Wirth) and a young girl named Jenn Platt (Christine Elise) , daughter of headquarter commander (Lee Ermey). The doctor may hold the means to avoid the extraterrestrial invasion as he discovers their friends are being taking over by cold human-duplicates , as one by one are turned into aliens . While examining specimen, Doctor Malone is approached by angst-ridden Major Collins (Forrest Whitaker), who asks him about psychological effects particularly narcophobia . The mysterious epidemic from outer space is spread along military camp , everybody are being taken over by emotionless , cold behaving beings . The strange seeds from outer space are growing and destroying a little base at an alarming attack. This scary Sci-Fi displays a tense screenplay freely based on Jack Finney novel titled &uml;Body snatchers&uml; that can be considered truly disturbing . Packs eerie suspense , chills , thrills , spectacular scenes , chilly events and pretty turns and twists . A ceaselessly inventive , ghastly rendition of the alien take-over paradigm , including a a nice built-in paranoia about a small military base is infiltrated by pods from outer space that replace and replicate human beings . It profits from an intense acting by Terry Kenney , Forrest Whitaker , R.

Appropriately exciting and frightening musical score by Joe Delia , though composed by means of synthesizer.

    The third version of Jack Finney's solid novel is a minor improvement on the previous remake, but whereas the superior 1956 original had a slow build-up and an eerie atmosphere, this one relies on gooey effects rather than suspense. The alien invasion occurs this time on a military base, where teenager Gabrielle Anwar and pilot Billy Wirth uncover a plot that jumps jerkily forward rather than slowly letting us know that something's up. The '56 version really made me feel sorry for poor old Kevin McCarthy as the pods closed in on him, but there's no claustrophobia here. One or two spooky scenes - the kids' identical finger paintings, for instance - are atypical of the otherwise flat manner in which the movie squanders its plot.

    Abel Ferrara is a talented and interesting director. He's made some great films ("bad lieutenant", "china girl") and he always seems to bring out the best in his actors. With "Body Snatchers", Ferrara tackles the task of directing a big budget, studio sci-fi film. And for the most part, he succeeds. Ferrara injects the film with tight closeups and experiments with tilted and off balanced framing. Making the viewer feel like something in the film is off and eschewed. But the film just isn't that exciting. It's more of a slow burner. It never really lives up to it's own potential sadly. But the effects are solid and some of the semi-transformation scenes are disturbing. The acting for the most part is solid with Meg Tilly giving the best monologue in the film. Gabrielle Anwar is gorgeous to stare at and Billy Wirth (Lost Boys) plays the chopper pilot hero. It could have been a better film, but "Body Snatchers" is entertaining, well-acted, and often creepy. I'm always surprised that an independent director like Ferrara was the guy chosen to helm such a big budget studio film...

    Body Snatchers is a scary movie about aliens replacing human beings with emotionless duplicates. The creepy thing is, people don't even notice because it's all happening on an army base. The star of Body Snatchers is Gabrielle Anwar, who plays a teenage girl named Marti. Marti resents her family. Her dad drags them all off to this army base because he works for the EPA and needs to inspect their hazardous materials. As events unfold Marti becomes concerned about her step brother, who witnesses something really disturbing and is obviously very afraid. But Marti's father is nagging her more and more. When she stays out late with a handsome chopper pilot they have a big argument and she is distracted from the problems of her little brother. When she does have the chance, she tries to reassure her brother that all is well...but she soon discovers it isn't. The base is being run by the Body Snatchers. And they want to finish the job of replacing all the humans with themselves. So she and her family have to run for it. The movie is very creepy and suspenseful and has a couple of shocking surprises. When it comes to horror films, I can be a bit of a wimp. I prefer more of the heroes to escape than sometimes make it. But Body Snatchers is up there with the best sci-fi thrillers in it's realistic treatment of bizarre events. It may not be completely logical, but it is smart. If anything, it's main weakness might be that it's so short. I suppose it had to be because if aliens are running an army base what can anyone do about it but get the heck out of there and hope they can save their family and friends in the process? Ultimately, I'm sort of grateful for this movie because it isn't a slasher film. It isn't an overblown alien invasion film with silly action scenes. It takes the subtle approach. It's almost like a really good X-files episode in that way (and I mean that as a compliment). The most dangerous aliens are the sneaky kind that infiltrate our society, not the ones who blow up recognizable landmarks with laser canons.

    Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an extraordinary film insomuch as its invasion narrative stands up to multiple interpretations that include anti- communism, McCarthyism (pro and con), miscegenation, anti-fordism, cultural conformity, and so on. Despite its many treasures and iconic status, there is just a bit too much emphasis placed on Siegel's version when it comes to considering the various remakes. Kauffman's 1978 version is my personal favourite as it turns San Francisco, the flower-power capital of late 60s free love and counter-culture into an Orwellian metropolis where mental health is precarious, individuation is outlawed and an absence of passion is normalised. I'm also a fan of Denny Zeitlin's creepy synth score, Kevin McCarthy's wink-wink cameo (knocked down by taxi driving Siegel, no less), and the introduction of that iconic other-worldly scream when a human is spotted - which was so effective it was incorporated in to the two subsequent remakes. Abel Ferarra's subversive version came hot on the heals of Operation Desert Storm where we saw invasion and counter-invasion televised pretty much 24/7 as the nation rallied around its troops and televisions. Ferrera's film is perhaps the most incendiary version as it dares to question USA's ubiquitous military culture driven by intense paranoia. No longer do we see the occasional man in uniform on an urban street. Rather, Ferrara reverses things, staging the action on an army base so that now we only see occasional citizens among scores of soldiers - and this creates a creepy us-and-them atmosphere from the outset. This invasion does not come from without, but from within as the line that separates soldier from citizen is erased. This makes Ferrara's film nothing like the "original" but a wholly unique and original work that stands on its own. Ferarra's version provides such a damning critique of a rarely challenged aspect of American culture that it's no wonder so many have dismissed it, picking on superficial elements and dated production values in preference to actually taking it seriously.

    Ferrara made spiritual what Kaufman made satirical what Siegel made political: The invasion hasn't been thwarted, it's merely waiting on the right filmmaker every twenty years for passionate revision. Were there to be a "re-remake" of Jack Finney's pulpy source who better to attempt it than Ferrara, the hysterical director of Bad Lieutenant, King of New York and a slew of other overwrought films? I mean, discernment and restraint are the last things a third Body Snatchers required. However, they're the tendency of this slick but uninspired version. It could've been wheeled by any bland director who knows how to point a camera and resist affronting or disturbing anyone. Don Siegel's Invasion virtually declared McCarthyism the emblematic gist behind the obedient body snatchers. Ferrara probably didn't want to bother anatomizing the '50s fear politics with those, if any, of the '90s, and knew that the premise was well-known even to viewers who'd never seen the first two versions. So he's short and snappy. In the first 5 minutes, a frenzied soldier traps the alienated teenage daughter of the EPA agent protagonist in a gas station bathroom, lunging from the dark to present the distraught forewarning, "They're out there. They get you when you sleep." Nothing that ensues approaches that opening shove. Some tilted camera angles and some misty lighting are the only tinges of Ferrara's excessively melodramatic style, except perhaps Meg Tilly's chilling turn. This talent-filled interpretation boosts its creepiest dashes from the 1978 version: the tentacles that slither out of the pods, the way the pod people draw attention to humans and unleash a mechanical-seeming screech. But this third of four adaptations of the 1955 novel doesn't impart Phil Kaufman's film's feeling one can enjoy from the right kind of horror or sci-fi movie that makes you just want to snuggle up in front of the TV late at night or on a really rainy or snowy day, everything you need in arm's reach of the couch and ottoman, and lose yourself in it's eerily fun atmosphere. And there is merely a hazy recognition of lots of other superior horror material that Ferrara's anamorphically shot sci-fi thriller calls to mind. The opening credits indiscreetly recall The Twilight Zone. One teary mother echoes The Stepford Wives. The worry of sleep, which was in the original film, has since been declared by the Elm Street series. Ferrara and his capable writers fellow exploitation veteran Larry Cohen and uniquely Bohemian horror director Stuart Gordon must've understood this, but there's no lighthearted drollness about these loans.

    Marti Malone (Gabreielle Anwar) is a beautiful but lonely teenager. Who is forced to go with his father Steve (Terry Kinney), his step-mother Carol (Meg Tilly) and her half-brother Andy (Reilly Murphy) travel to a remote Military Base in Alabama. Slowly, Marti and Andy discovers that things in this Military Base are not what they seemed. Civilians and Soldiers are acting-alike and they are humorless (Not to mention Soulless). Now the family find themselves in danger and you can't trust no one. The only thing, you can do to save yourself is to not fall asleep. Directed by Abel Ferrara (China Girl, The Funeral, King of New York) made an interesting, sometimes fascinating Science-Fiction thriller with good performances. The Special Effects are good, expect for one sequence towards the end in the helicopter. Tilly gets the most memorable, important lines of dialogue during one eerie scene is the most effective of the movie. "Body Snatchers" was unfortunately an box office disappointment, since Warner Bros didn't know how to market the picture. Despite some very good reviews from film critics, especially Roger Ebert. This movie was out in limited released instead but the film did have an cult following on video. DVD has an grainy anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an strong Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD has no special features. Oscar-Winner:Forest Whitaker has an bit part as a Military Doctor. This is the third adaptation of "Body Snatchers" and probably the least known of the four adaptations. Still, this version is better than the last adaptation, "The Invasion". The problem with the third version, the feature is somewhat too short of a real satisfaction but the real mistake was setting this at the Military Base, where everyone acts alike was not an good idea. Still, "Body Snatchers" is strong enough to overcome these flaws. Farrara's film is certainly well made but as a science-fiction thriller is joyless to say the least. Screen-Story by Raymond Cistheri and Larry Cohen (A Return to Salem's Lot, Phone Booth, Q:The Wigned Serpent). Screenplay by Staurt Gordon (Fortress, Re-Animator, Stuck), Dennis Paoli (Castle Freak, The Dentist, The Pit and the Pendulum) and Nicolas St. John (The Addiction, Dangerous Game, Fear City). Some die-hard fans of this version, imagine what professional "B" movie filmmaker:Gordon could have done with this third adaptation. Arriscope. (****/*****).

    Every time I watch an Abel Ferrara movie, I keep hoping that I will finally begin to understand why he is considered by so many to be an interesting and original independent film-maker. And each time I become more baffled as to how anyone ever got the idea of esteeming him so highly. Admittedly, a SECOND remake of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" would have been a tough job for even a genuinely brilliant director to pull off successfully, given that both the original and the first remake were both excellent, subtle, complex movies in their own right. But Ferrara and his scriptwriter seem to ruin their own slim chances from the very outset - above all through the almost incomprehensibly dumb and clumsy decision to set this version on a military base, of all places. Both Siegel's original version and Kaufman's first remake had given themselves a chance to draw on that deepest source of terror - ambiguity - by setting their movies in environments that were innocuous and even comforting on the surface: the generic American "small town" of the 1950s and the affluent libertarian paradise of 1970s San Francisco. What a crazy casting-away of this important resource to set the story in an army camp - an environment which is bristling with menace and alienation even when there is NO sinister alien force at work in it! The scenes with glassy-eyed soldiers in Ferrara's film understandably produce absolutely nothing of the unsettling effect of the scenes of glassy-eyed San Franciscan store-clerks and dentists in Kaufman's - for the simple reason that a soldier is MEANT to be glassy-eyed! Even on the "micro"-level, though, the script is a disaster - another cheap and shoddy piece of work from Nicholas St. John which really makes one wonder why Ferrara works so consistently with this hack. The voice-over given to Gabrielle Anwar is embarrassingly lacking in subtlety - "If we had known what was going to happen, we would have run..." - and appears to be intended to try to generate a tension that the action itself fails to generate. But scene after individual scene reeks of psychological implausibility and lazy writing. To choose just one example among many, take the little game of "Never" played by Anwar and the young soldier she is falling in love with. This "truth-or-dare"-type game is clearly a device to accellerate the process of the two characters' becoming intimate with one another. But the staging of the moments of "discovery of the other's secrets" is hopelessly artificial. We are asked to believe, for example, that the young girl played by Anwar would be shocked and moved to discover that the answer to the question "Have you ever shot someone?" is "Yes" - when it is put to a serving member of the US armed forces! This painfully artificial scene is pretty representative of the artificiality and uninspiredness of the whole film. As I say, another reason to ask: what the hell does anyone SEE in Abel Ferrara?

    Over the years several 'The Body Snatchers' movies were made. Non of them were much alike really and they are set at different places with different characters each time. This version of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is certainly not as bad as its reputation and as a matter of fact is actually a quite good genre movie on its own. This time events are taking place at a military base. The concept is still the same though, in which in alien invasion takes place by letting mysterious pods replicate and killing human bodies in their sleep. The pods look like an exact copy of their victim but of course they are not. In my opinion the story behind 'The Body Snatchers' has always been one of the most original and best ones, concerning movies dealing with an alien invasion. Its concept provide the movie with plenty of tension and also mystery, especially when you have not seen a 'The Body Snatchers' movie before. This particular movie version does also handle its concept well. It's not as great as the previous two movie version of it but it still has plenty of good moments and originality of its own in it. It's certainly better and way more exciting to watch than the 2007 movie version, starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. I still wished this movie had some of those great actors in it. There are some good actors in this movie but they play secondary characters, such as is the case with R. Lee Ermey and Forest Whitaker. The main parts are being played by some big unknowns, who aren't really charismatic or likable enough. A missed opportunity. A good, different version of the well known story. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Whilst waiting with anticipation for Abel Ferrara's King of New York to arrive in the post,I looked at his film listings on IMDb and I spotted this film,which I have seen being sold at some of the DVD shops near me. The main thing that caught my eye was,for a film that got pushed onto being a straight to video title in the UK by Warners,is,that it is a very well shot film,with an interesting story and a strong cast. The plot: The Malone family move to a military compound so that the husband/dad (Steve Malone) can do test on the soil and water in the area.This is due to some of the people in the area going "crazy" and becoming very paranoid ,and constantly saying that aliens are taking over the human race. Though the family first think that they have moved to a nice area,Their young son starts to think that something very wrong is happening.At his school,he notices that all the other children are painting the exact same picture identically!.Sadly for him,the problems don't stay at school ,when he realises that his mum is acting very strangely,which leads him to start telling the rest of the family that "Mummys dead".At first,they all think that he is being a very nasty kid.However,the older sister starts to think that he maybe telling the truth,when she wakes up to discover some that some extremely disturbing creatures have invaded there house. View on the film; When the credits flashed on the screen,listing the people that wrote the story and the screenplay to the film,I was very pleased to see the very talented Larry Cohen and Stuart Gordon being listed as two of the people that wrote the film.Whilst the stunning 1956 and the 1978 versions of the Body Snatchers,had a strong subtext about Communism (the 56 version)or,a post-Watergate America (the 78 version),this version has a very strong Stephen King/X-Files feel.The first part of the film is spent building the characters up and giving them some depth.The film also does a great job at tapping into a government/military Trust-No- One paranoia.This is done by setting most the film on an army base,that has some very strong overtones of being based on the infamous Area 51. From almost the first few minutes of the film,my reaction to Abel Ferrars direction,was one of complete amazement.Whilst most film makers would have made this film in a rush,and have turned it into a bad B- Movie (espicaly with all the trouble that Warners were giving Ferrara about the film.)Instead,Abel shoots the film in a fantastic way,with some surprisingly impressive camera moves,a very daring ending (an ending,that the legendary director Don Siegel originally wanted for his version of the Body Snatchers,until the studio told him to go for a more "optimistic" ending instead)and by doing a great job at building up the tension,as the last remaining humans try to escape the unstoppable invasion. Final view on the film: A great sci-fi thriller,with a strong story and excellent direction by Abel Ferrara.

The '56 version really made me feel sorry for poor old Kevin McCarthy as the pods closed in on him, but there's no claustrophobia here. One or two spooky scenes - the kids' identical finger paintings, for instance - are atypical of the otherwise flat manner in which the movie squanders its plot.

    Abel Ferrara is a talented and interesting director. He's made some great films ("bad lieutenant", "china girl") and he always seems to bring out the best in his actors. With "Body Snatchers", Ferrara tackles the task of directing a big budget, studio sci-fi film. And for the most part, he succeeds. Ferrara injects the film with tight closeups and experiments with tilted and off balanced framing. Making the viewer feel like something in the film is off and eschewed. But the film just isn't that exciting. It's more of a slow burner. It never really lives up to it's own potential sadly. But the effects are solid and some of the semi-transformation scenes are disturbing. The acting for the most part is solid with Meg Tilly giving the best monologue in the film. Gabrielle Anwar is gorgeous to stare at and Billy Wirth (Lost Boys) plays the chopper pilot hero. It could have been a better film, but "Body Snatchers" is entertaining, well-acted, and often creepy. I'm always surprised that an independent director like Ferrara was the guy chosen to helm such a big budget studio film...

    Body Snatchers is a scary movie about aliens replacing human beings with emotionless duplicates. The creepy thing is, people don't even notice because it's all happening on an army base. The star of Body Snatchers is Gabrielle Anwar, who plays a teenage girl named Marti. Marti resents her family. Her dad drags them all off to this army base because he works for the EPA and needs to inspect their hazardous materials. As events unfold Marti becomes concerned about her step brother, who witnesses something really disturbing and is obviously very afraid. But Marti's father is nagging her more and more. When she stays out late with a handsome chopper pilot they have a big argument and she is distracted from the problems of her little brother. When she does have the chance, she tries to reassure her brother that all is well...but she soon discovers it isn't. The base is being run by the Body Snatchers. And they want to finish the job of replacing all the humans with themselves. So she and her family have to run for it. The movie is very creepy and suspenseful and has a couple of shocking surprises. When it comes to horror films, I can be a bit of a wimp. I prefer more of the heroes to escape than sometimes make it. But Body Snatchers is up there with the best sci-fi thrillers in it's realistic treatment of bizarre events. It may not be completely logical, but it is smart. If anything, it's main weakness might be that it's so short. I suppose it had to be because if aliens are running an army base what can anyone do about it but get the heck out of there and hope they can save their family and friends in the process? Ultimately, I'm sort of grateful for this movie because it isn't a slasher film. It isn't an overblown alien invasion film with silly action scenes. It takes the subtle approach. It's almost like a really good X-files episode in that way (and I mean that as a compliment). The most dangerous aliens are the sneaky kind that infiltrate our society, not the ones who blow up recognizable landmarks with laser canons.

    Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an extraordinary film insomuch as its invasion narrative stands up to multiple interpretations that include anti- communism, McCarthyism (pro and con), miscegenation, anti-fordism, cultural conformity, and so on. Despite its many treasures and iconic status, there is just a bit too much emphasis placed on Siegel's version when it comes to considering the various remakes. Kauffman's 1978 version is my personal favourite as it turns San Francisco, the flower-power capital of late 60s free love and counter-culture into an Orwellian metropolis where mental health is precarious, individuation is outlawed and an absence of passion is normalised. I'm also a fan of Denny Zeitlin's creepy synth score, Kevin McCarthy's wink-wink cameo (knocked down by taxi driving Siegel, no less), and the introduction of that iconic other-worldly scream when a human is spotted - which was so effective it was incorporated in to the two subsequent remakes. Abel Ferarra's subversive version came hot on the heals of Operation Desert Storm where we saw invasion and counter-invasion televised pretty much 24/7 as the nation rallied around its troops and televisions. Ferrera's film is perhaps the most incendiary version as it dares to question USA's ubiquitous military culture driven by intense paranoia. No longer do we see the occasional man in uniform on an urban street. Rather, Ferrara reverses things, staging the action on an army base so that now we only see occasional citizens among scores of soldiers - and this creates a creepy us-and-them atmosphere from the outset. This invasion does not come from without, but from within as the line that separates soldier from citizen is erased. This makes Ferrara's film nothing like the "original" but a wholly unique and original work that stands on its own. Ferarra's version provides such a damning critique of a rarely challenged aspect of American culture that it's no wonder so many have dismissed it, picking on superficial elements and dated production values in preference to actually taking it seriously.

    Ferrara made spiritual what Kaufman made satirical what Siegel made political: The invasion hasn't been thwarted, it's merely waiting on the right filmmaker every twenty years for passionate revision. Were there to be a "re-remake" of Jack Finney's pulpy source who better to attempt it than Ferrara, the hysterical director of Bad Lieutenant, King of New York and a slew of other overwrought films? I mean, discernment and restraint are the last things a third Body Snatchers required. However, they're the tendency of this slick but uninspired version. It could've been wheeled by any bland director who knows how to point a camera and resist affronting or disturbing anyone. Don Siegel's Invasion virtually declared McCarthyism the emblematic gist behind the obedient body snatchers. Ferrara probably didn't want to bother anatomizing the '50s fear politics with those, if any, of the '90s, and knew that the premise was well-known even to viewers who'd never seen the first two versions. So he's short and snappy. In the first 5 minutes, a frenzied soldier traps the alienated teenage daughter of the EPA agent protagonist in a gas station bathroom, lunging from the dark to present the distraught forewarning, "They're out there. They get you when you sleep." Nothing that ensues approaches that opening shove. Some tilted camera angles and some misty lighting are the only tinges of Ferrara's excessively melodramatic style, except perhaps Meg Tilly's chilling turn. This talent-filled interpretation boosts its creepiest dashes from the 1978 version: the tentacles that slither out of the pods, the way the pod people draw attention to humans and unleash a mechanical-seeming screech. But this third of four adaptations of the 1955 novel doesn't impart Phil Kaufman's film's feeling one can enjoy from the right kind of horror or sci-fi movie that makes you just want to snuggle up in front of the TV late at night or on a really rainy or snowy day, everything you need in arm's reach of the couch and ottoman, and lose yourself in it's eerily fun atmosphere. And there is merely a hazy recognition of lots of other superior horror material that Ferrara's anamorphically shot sci-fi thriller calls to mind. The opening credits indiscreetly recall The Twilight Zone. One teary mother echoes The Stepford Wives. The worry of sleep, which was in the original film, has since been declared by the Elm Street series. Ferrara and his capable writers fellow exploitation veteran Larry Cohen and uniquely Bohemian horror director Stuart Gordon must've understood this, but there's no lighthearted drollness about these loans.

    Marti Malone (Gabreielle Anwar) is a beautiful but lonely teenager. Who is forced to go with his father Steve (Terry Kinney), his step-mother Carol (Meg Tilly) and her half-brother Andy (Reilly Murphy) travel to a remote Military Base in Alabama. Slowly, Marti and Andy discovers that things in this Military Base are not what they seemed. Civilians and Soldiers are acting-alike and they are humorless (Not to mention Soulless). Now the family find themselves in danger and you can't trust no one. The only thing, you can do to save yourself is to not fall asleep. Directed by Abel Ferrara (China Girl, The Funeral, King of New York) made an interesting, sometimes fascinating Science-Fiction thriller with good performances. The Special Effects are good, expect for one sequence towards the end in the helicopter. Tilly gets the most memorable, important lines of dialogue during one eerie scene is the most effective of the movie. "Body Snatchers" was unfortunately an box office disappointment, since Warner Bros didn't know how to market the picture. Despite some very good reviews from film critics, especially Roger Ebert. This movie was out in limited released instead but the film did have an cult following on video. DVD has an grainy anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an strong Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD has no special features. Oscar-Winner:Forest Whitaker has an bit part as a Military Doctor. This is the third adaptation of "Body Snatchers" and probably the least known of the four adaptations. Still, this version is better than the last adaptation, "The Invasion". The problem with the third version, the feature is somewhat too short of a real satisfaction but the real mistake was setting this at the Military Base, where everyone acts alike was not an good idea. Still, "Body Snatchers" is strong enough to overcome these flaws. Farrara's film is certainly well made but as a science-fiction thriller is joyless to say the least. Screen-Story by Raymond Cistheri and Larry Cohen (A Return to Salem's Lot, Phone Booth, Q:The Wigned Serpent). Screenplay by Staurt Gordon (Fortress, Re-Animator, Stuck), Dennis Paoli (Castle Freak, The Dentist, The Pit and the Pendulum) and Nicolas St. John (The Addiction, Dangerous Game, Fear City). Some die-hard fans of this version, imagine what professional "B" movie filmmaker:Gordon could have done with this third adaptation. Arriscope. (****/*****).

    Every time I watch an Abel Ferrara movie, I keep hoping that I will finally begin to understand why he is considered by so many to be an interesting and original independent film-maker. And each time I become more baffled as to how anyone ever got the idea of esteeming him so highly. Admittedly, a SECOND remake of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" would have been a tough job for even a genuinely brilliant director to pull off successfully, given that both the original and the first remake were both excellent, subtle, complex movies in their own right. But Ferrara and his scriptwriter seem to ruin their own slim chances from the very outset - above all through the almost incomprehensibly dumb and clumsy decision to set this version on a military base, of all places. Both Siegel's original version and Kaufman's first remake had given themselves a chance to draw on that deepest source of terror - ambiguity - by setting their movies in environments that were innocuous and even comforting on the surface: the generic American "small town" of the 1950s and the affluent libertarian paradise of 1970s San Francisco. What a crazy casting-away of this important resource to set the story in an army camp - an environment which is bristling with menace and alienation even when there is NO sinister alien force at work in it! The scenes with glassy-eyed soldiers in Ferrara's film understandably produce absolutely nothing of the unsettling effect of the scenes of glassy-eyed San Franciscan store-clerks and dentists in Kaufman's - for the simple reason that a soldier is MEANT to be glassy-eyed! Even on the "micro"-level, though, the script is a disaster - another cheap and shoddy piece of work from Nicholas St. John which really makes one wonder why Ferrara works so consistently with this hack. The voice-over given to Gabrielle Anwar is embarrassingly lacking in subtlety - "If we had known what was going to happen, we would have run..." - and appears to be intended to try to generate a tension that the action itself fails to generate. But scene after individual scene reeks of psychological implausibility and lazy writing. To choose just one example among many, take the little game of "Never" played by Anwar and the young soldier she is falling in love with. This "truth-or-dare"-type game is clearly a device to accellerate the process of the two characters' becoming intimate with one another. But the staging of the moments of "discovery of the other's secrets" is hopelessly artificial. We are asked to believe, for example, that the young girl played by Anwar would be shocked and moved to discover that the answer to the question "Have you ever shot someone?" is "Yes" - when it is put to a serving member of the US armed forces! This painfully artificial scene is pretty representative of the artificiality and uninspiredness of the whole film. As I say, another reason to ask: what the hell does anyone SEE in Abel Ferrara?

    Over the years several 'The Body Snatchers' movies were made. Non of them were much alike really and they are set at different places with different characters each time. This version of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is certainly not as bad as its reputation and as a matter of fact is actually a quite good genre movie on its own. This time events are taking place at a military base. The concept is still the same though, in which in alien invasion takes place by letting mysterious pods replicate and killing human bodies in their sleep. The pods look like an exact copy of their victim but of course they are not. In my opinion the story behind 'The Body Snatchers' has always been one of the most original and best ones, concerning movies dealing with an alien invasion. Its concept provide the movie with plenty of tension and also mystery, especially when you have not seen a 'The Body Snatchers' movie before. This particular movie version does also handle its concept well. It's not as great as the previous two movie version of it but it still has plenty of good moments and originality of its own in it. It's certainly better and way more exciting to watch than the 2007 movie version, starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. I still wished this movie had some of those great actors in it. There are some good actors in this movie but they play secondary characters, such as is the case with R. Lee Ermey and Forest Whitaker. The main parts are being played by some big unknowns, who aren't really charismatic or likable enough. A missed opportunity. A good, different version of the well known story. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Whilst waiting with anticipation for Abel Ferrara's King of New York to arrive in the post,I looked at his film listings on IMDb and I spotted this film,which I have seen being sold at some of the DVD shops near me. The main thing that caught my eye was,for a film that got pushed onto being a straight to video title in the UK by Warners,is,that it is a very well shot film,with an interesting story and a strong cast. The plot: The Malone family move to a military compound so that the husband/dad (Steve Malone) can do test on the soil and water in the area.This is due to some of the people in the area going "crazy" and becoming very paranoid ,and constantly saying that aliens are taking over the human race. Though the family first think that they have moved to a nice area,Their young son starts to think that something very wrong is happening.At his school,he notices that all the other children are painting the exact same picture identically!.Sadly for him,the problems don't stay at school ,when he realises that his mum is acting very strangely,which leads him to start telling the rest of the family that "Mummys dead".At first,they all think that he is being a very nasty kid.However,the older sister starts to think that he maybe telling the truth,when she wakes up to discover some that some extremely disturbing creatures have invaded there house. View on the film; When the credits flashed on the screen,listing the people that wrote the story and the screenplay to the film,I was very pleased to see the very talented Larry Cohen and Stuart Gordon being listed as two of the people that wrote the film.Whilst the stunning 1956 and the 1978 versions of the Body Snatchers,had a strong subtext about Communism (the 56 version)or,a post-Watergate America (the 78 version),this version has a very strong Stephen King/X-Files feel.The first part of the film is spent building the characters up and giving them some depth.The film also does a great job at tapping into a government/military Trust-No- One paranoia.This is done by setting most the film on an army base,that has some very strong overtones of being based on the infamous Area 51. From almost the first few minutes of the film,my reaction to Abel Ferrars direction,was one of complete amazement.Whilst most film makers would have made this film in a rush,and have turned it into a bad B- Movie (espicaly with all the trouble that Warners were giving Ferrara about the film.)Instead,Abel shoots the film in a fantastic way,with some surprisingly impressive camera moves,a very daring ending (an ending,that the legendary director Don Siegel originally wanted for his version of the Body Snatchers,until the studio told him to go for a more "optimistic" ending instead)and by doing a great job at building up the tension,as the last remaining humans try to escape the unstoppable invasion. Final view on the film: A great sci-fi thriller,with a strong story and excellent direction by Abel Ferrara.

    Acceptable Sci-Fi picture which achieved a moderated success on its appearance and dealing with a teenage girl and her father discover alien clones are replacing humans on a remote U.S. military base in Alabama . This is a passable rendition starred by a good cast such as Forest Whitaker , Meg Tilly, Terry Kinney and Gabriella Anwar . It is an average budget version , though sometimes slow-paced and including some jolts of horror . Science Fiction , military and fantasy is presented in its most horrifying form . A genuinely frightening , chilling exercise in nightmare dislocation in which hideous creatures from outer space arrive on Earth with plans of conquest by means of pods and being freely based upon a novel by Jack Finney . There are not monsters only the residents of a military headquarter , as their wills , minds and bodies taken over by a weird form of life from outer space . This is the third adaptation , still very scary and creepy about a vintage novel deals with some military residents who are being replaced by duplicates hatched from weird pods . It creates an altering the human behaviour in the new invaders . As a doctor (Terry Kinney) must protect his daughter (significant role for gorgeous Gabriella Anwar) and her new stepmother (Meg Tilly), and soon aware that pods from outer space are duplicating and menacing everyone there . Meantime , the teenager daughter befriends a handsome attack helicopter pilot, Tim Young (Billy Wirth) and a young girl named Jenn Platt (Christine Elise) , daughter of headquarter commander (Lee Ermey). The doctor may hold the means to avoid the extraterrestrial invasion as he discovers their friends are being taking over by cold human-duplicates , as one by one are turned into aliens . While examining specimen, Doctor Malone is approached by angst-ridden Major Collins (Forrest Whitaker), who asks him about psychological effects particularly narcophobia . The mysterious epidemic from outer space is spread along military camp , everybody are being taken over by emotionless , cold behaving beings . The strange seeds from outer space are growing and destroying a little base at an alarming attack. This scary Sci-Fi displays a tense screenplay freely based on Jack Finney novel titled &uml;Body snatchers&uml; that can be considered truly disturbing . Packs eerie suspense , chills , thrills , spectacular scenes , chilly events and pretty turns and twists . A ceaselessly inventive , ghastly rendition of the alien take-over paradigm , including a a nice built-in paranoia about a small military base is infiltrated by pods from outer space that replace and replicate human beings . It profits from an intense acting by Terry Kenney , Forrest Whitaker , R. Lee Ermey along with an enjoyable Gabrielle Anwar ; furthermore , a right direction by Abel Ferrra who proved himself master of the eerie clutch at the base of one's spine . Appropriately exciting and frightening musical score by Joe Delia , though composed by means of synthesizer. Atmospheric cinematography and evocatively eerie ambient by cameraman Bazzeli , this was the first film shot with Arriscope anamorphic lenses, which were created for Arri by the German manufacturer Isco-Optic. Adequate production design and considerable visual and special effects . The motion picture was professionally directed by Abel Ferrara . Director Ferrara brought an entirely new approach to the Sci-Fi field to a well known story that has been shot various times . He filmed an attractive tale and it has emerged as an acceptable Sci-Fi thriller that brings astonishing nightmares . Lovers of the thriller/chiller should no miss this considerable Sci-Fi , everybody will have fun being scared by this expertly crafted film . Other versions about this known story are the following : a post-McCarthy paranoid fantasy epic titled &uml;Invasion of the body snatchers&uml; (1958), stunning and frightening adaptation which emerged as a cinema classic which achieved tremendous and unexpected success on its appearance , so well tuned for the times that some saw it a parable Communist Witch Hunts ; being compellingly directed by Donald Siegel with Kevin MacCarthy , Dana Wynter , Larry Gates , Carolyn Jones , and Sam Peckinpah ; 1978 new version also titled &uml;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&uml; , one of few instances where a remake is an improvement on the original , directed by Philip Kauffman with Donald Sutherland , Brooke Adams and features cameos by Don Siegel and Kevin McCarthy from the original , realized with great originality in spite of being a remake concerning again about mysterious seeds duplicating people . Lately recent version that results to be the least satisfactory and yet another inferior titled &uml;Invasion&uml; with Daniel Craig, Nicole Kidman , Jeffrey Wright and directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel , this so-so take on , it takes advantage of the advances in FX , sound technology and some interesting visual effects .

Were there to be a "re-remake" of Jack Finney's pulpy source who better to attempt it than Ferrara, the hysterical director of Bad Lieutenant, King of New York and a slew of other overwrought films? I mean, discernment and restraint are the last things a third Body Snatchers required. However, they're the tendency of this slick but uninspired version. It could've been wheeled by any bland director who knows how to point a camera and resist affronting or disturbing anyone. Don Siegel's Invasion virtually declared McCarthyism the emblematic gist behind the obedient body snatchers. Ferrara probably didn't want to bother anatomizing the '50s fear politics with those, if any, of the '90s, and knew that the premise was well-known even to viewers who'd never seen the first two versions. So he's short and snappy. In the first 5 minutes, a frenzied soldier traps the alienated teenage daughter of the EPA agent protagonist in a gas station bathroom, lunging from the dark to present the distraught forewarning, "They're out there. They get you when you sleep." Nothing that ensues approaches that opening shove. Some tilted camera angles and some misty lighting are the only tinges of Ferrara's excessively melodramatic style, except perhaps Meg Tilly's chilling turn. This talent-filled interpretation boosts its creepiest dashes from the 1978 version: the tentacles that slither out of the pods, the way the pod people draw attention to humans and unleash a mechanical-seeming screech. But this third of four adaptations of the 1955 novel doesn't impart Phil Kaufman's film's feeling one can enjoy from the right kind of horror or sci-fi movie that makes you just want to snuggle up in front of the TV late at night or on a really rainy or snowy day, everything you need in arm's reach of the couch and ottoman, and lose yourself in it's eerily fun atmosphere. And there is merely a hazy recognition of lots of other superior horror material that Ferrara's anamorphically shot sci-fi thriller calls to mind. The opening credits indiscreetly recall The Twilight Zone. One teary mother echoes The Stepford Wives. The worry of sleep, which was in the original film, has since been declared by the Elm Street series. Ferrara and his capable writers fellow exploitation veteran Larry Cohen and uniquely Bohemian horror director Stuart Gordon must've understood this, but there's no lighthearted drollness about these loans.

    Marti Malone (Gabreielle Anwar) is a beautiful but lonely teenager. Who is forced to go with his father Steve (Terry Kinney), his step-mother Carol (Meg Tilly) and her half-brother Andy (Reilly Murphy) travel to a remote Military Base in Alabama. Slowly, Marti and Andy discovers that things in this Military Base are not what they seemed. Civilians and Soldiers are acting-alike and they are humorless (Not to mention Soulless). Now the family find themselves in danger and you can't trust no one. The only thing, you can do to save yourself is to not fall asleep. Directed by Abel Ferrara (China Girl, The Funeral, King of New York) made an interesting, sometimes fascinating Science-Fiction thriller with good performances. The Special Effects are good, expect for one sequence towards the end in the helicopter. Tilly gets the most memorable, important lines of dialogue during one eerie scene is the most effective of the movie. "Body Snatchers" was unfortunately an box office disappointment, since Warner Bros didn't know how to market the picture. Despite some very good reviews from film critics, especially Roger Ebert. This movie was out in limited released instead but the film did have an cult following on video. DVD has an grainy anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an strong Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD has no special features. Oscar-Winner:Forest Whitaker has an bit part as a Military Doctor. This is the third adaptation of "Body Snatchers" and probably the least known of the four adaptations. Still, this version is better than the last adaptation, "The Invasion". The problem with the third version, the feature is somewhat too short of a real satisfaction but the real mistake was setting this at the Military Base, where everyone acts alike was not an good idea. Still, "Body Snatchers" is strong enough to overcome these flaws. Farrara's film is certainly well made but as a science-fiction thriller is joyless to say the least. Screen-Story by Raymond Cistheri and Larry Cohen (A Return to Salem's Lot, Phone Booth, Q:The Wigned Serpent). Screenplay by Staurt Gordon (Fortress, Re-Animator, Stuck), Dennis Paoli (Castle Freak, The Dentist, The Pit and the Pendulum) and Nicolas St. John (The Addiction, Dangerous Game, Fear City).

    Every time I watch an Abel Ferrara movie, I keep hoping that I will finally begin to understand why he is considered by so many to be an interesting and original independent film-maker. And each time I become more baffled as to how anyone ever got the idea of esteeming him so highly. Admittedly, a SECOND remake of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" would have been a tough job for even a genuinely brilliant director to pull off successfully, given that both the original and the first remake were both excellent, subtle, complex movies in their own right. But Ferrara and his scriptwriter seem to ruin their own slim chances from the very outset - above all through the almost incomprehensibly dumb and clumsy decision to set this version on a military base, of all places. Both Siegel's original version and Kaufman's first remake had given themselves a chance to draw on that deepest source of terror - ambiguity - by setting their movies in environments that were innocuous and even comforting on the surface: the generic American "small town" of the 1950s and the affluent libertarian paradise of 1970s San Francisco. What a crazy casting-away of this important resource to set the story in an army camp - an environment which is bristling with menace and alienation even when there is NO sinister alien force at work in it! The scenes with glassy-eyed soldiers in Ferrara's film understandably produce absolutely nothing of the unsettling effect of the scenes of glassy-eyed San Franciscan store-clerks and dentists in Kaufman's - for the simple reason that a soldier is MEANT to be glassy-eyed! Even on the "micro"-level, though, the script is a disaster - another cheap and shoddy piece of work from Nicholas St. John which really makes one wonder why Ferrara works so consistently with this hack. The voice-over given to Gabrielle Anwar is embarrassingly lacking in subtlety - "If we had known what was going to happen, we would have run..." - and appears to be intended to try to generate a tension that the action itself fails to generate. But scene after individual scene reeks of psychological implausibility and lazy writing. To choose just one example among many, take the little game of "Never" played by Anwar and the young soldier she is falling in love with. This "truth-or-dare"-type game is clearly a device to accellerate the process of the two characters' becoming intimate with one another. But the staging of the moments of "discovery of the other's secrets" is hopelessly artificial. We are asked to believe, for example, that the young girl played by Anwar would be shocked and moved to discover that the answer to the question "Have you ever shot someone?" is "Yes" - when it is put to a serving member of the US armed forces! This painfully artificial scene is pretty representative of the artificiality and uninspiredness of the whole film. As I say, another reason to ask: what the hell does anyone SEE in Abel Ferrara?

    Over the years several 'The Body Snatchers' movies were made. Non of them were much alike really and they are set at different places with different characters each time. This version of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is certainly not as bad as its reputation and as a matter of fact is actually a quite good genre movie on its own. This time events are taking place at a military base. The concept is still the same though, in which in alien invasion takes place by letting mysterious pods replicate and killing human bodies in their sleep. The pods look like an exact copy of their victim but of course they are not. In my opinion the story behind 'The Body Snatchers' has always been one of the most original and best ones, concerning movies dealing with an alien invasion. Its concept provide the movie with plenty of tension and also mystery, especially when you have not seen a 'The Body Snatchers' movie before. This particular movie version does also handle its concept well. It's not as great as the previous two movie version of it but it still has plenty of good moments and originality of its own in it. It's certainly better and way more exciting to watch than the 2007 movie version, starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. I still wished this movie had some of those great actors in it. There are some good actors in this movie but they play secondary characters, such as is the case with R. Lee Ermey and Forest Whitaker. The main parts are being played by some big unknowns, who aren't really charismatic or likable enough. A missed opportunity. A good, different version of the well known story. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Whilst waiting with anticipation for Abel Ferrara's King of New York to arrive in the post,I looked at his film listings on IMDb and I spotted this film,which I have seen being sold at some of the DVD shops near me. The main thing that caught my eye was,for a film that got pushed onto being a straight to video title in the UK by Warners,is,that it is a very well shot film,with an interesting story and a strong cast. The plot: The Malone family move to a military compound so that the husband/dad (Steve Malone) can do test on the soil and water in the area.This is due to some of the people in the area going "crazy" and becoming very paranoid ,and constantly saying that aliens are taking over the human race. Though the family first think that they have moved to a nice area,Their young son starts to think that something very wrong is happening.At his school,he notices that all the other children are painting the exact same picture identically!.Sadly for him,the problems don't stay at school ,when he realises that his mum is acting very strangely,which leads him to start telling the rest of the family that "Mummys dead".At first,they all think that he is being a very nasty kid.However,the older sister starts to think that he maybe telling the truth,when she wakes up to discover some that some extremely disturbing creatures have invaded there house. View on the film; When the credits flashed on the screen,listing the people that wrote the story and the screenplay to the film,I was very pleased to see the very talented Larry Cohen and Stuart Gordon being listed as two of the people that wrote the film.Whilst the stunning 1956 and the 1978 versions of the Body Snatchers,had a strong subtext about Communism (the 56 version)or,a post-Watergate America (the 78 version),this version has a very strong Stephen King/X-Files feel.The first part of the film is spent building the characters up and giving them some depth.The film also does a great job at tapping into a government/military Trust-No- One paranoia.This is done by setting most the film on an army base,that has some very strong overtones of being based on the infamous Area 51. From almost the first few minutes of the film,my reaction to Abel Ferrars direction,was one of complete amazement.Whilst most film makers would have made this film in a rush,and have turned it into a bad B- Movie (espicaly with all the trouble that Warners were giving Ferrara about the film.)Instead,Abel shoots the film in a fantastic way,with some surprisingly impressive camera moves,a very daring ending (an ending,that the legendary director Don Siegel originally wanted for his version of the Body Snatchers,until the studio told him to go for a more "optimistic" ending instead)and by doing a great job at building up the tension,as the last remaining humans try to escape the unstoppable invasion. Final view on the film: A great sci-fi thriller,with a strong story and excellent direction by Abel Ferrara.

    Acceptable Sci-Fi picture which achieved a moderated success on its appearance and dealing with a teenage girl and her father discover alien clones are replacing humans on a remote U.S. military base in Alabama . This is a passable rendition starred by a good cast such as Forest Whitaker , Meg Tilly, Terry Kinney and Gabriella Anwar . It is an average budget version , though sometimes slow-paced and including some jolts of horror . Science Fiction , military and fantasy is presented in its most horrifying form . A genuinely frightening , chilling exercise in nightmare dislocation in which hideous creatures from outer space arrive on Earth with plans of conquest by means of pods and being freely based upon a novel by Jack Finney . There are not monsters only the residents of a military headquarter , as their wills , minds and bodies taken over by a weird form of life from outer space . This is the third adaptation , still very scary and creepy about a vintage novel deals with some military residents who are being replaced by duplicates hatched from weird pods . It creates an altering the human behaviour in the new invaders . As a doctor (Terry Kinney) must protect his daughter (significant role for gorgeous Gabriella Anwar) and her new stepmother (Meg Tilly), and soon aware that pods from outer space are duplicating and menacing everyone there . Meantime , the teenager daughter befriends a handsome attack helicopter pilot, Tim Young (Billy Wirth) and a young girl named Jenn Platt (Christine Elise) , daughter of headquarter commander (Lee Ermey). The doctor may hold the means to avoid the extraterrestrial invasion as he discovers their friends are being taking over by cold human-duplicates , as one by one are turned into aliens . While examining specimen, Doctor Malone is approached by angst-ridden Major Collins (Forrest Whitaker), who asks him about psychological effects particularly narcophobia . The mysterious epidemic from outer space is spread along military camp , everybody are being taken over by emotionless , cold behaving beings . The strange seeds from outer space are growing and destroying a little base at an alarming attack. This scary Sci-Fi displays a tense screenplay freely based on Jack Finney novel titled &uml;Body snatchers&uml; that can be considered truly disturbing . Packs eerie suspense , chills , thrills , spectacular scenes , chilly events and pretty turns and twists . A ceaselessly inventive , ghastly rendition of the alien take-over paradigm , including a a nice built-in paranoia about a small military base is infiltrated by pods from outer space that replace and replicate human beings . It profits from an intense acting by Terry Kenney , Forrest Whitaker , R. Lee Ermey along with an enjoyable Gabrielle Anwar ; furthermore , a right direction by Abel Ferrra who proved himself master of the eerie clutch at the base of one's spine . Appropriately exciting and frightening musical score by Joe Delia , though composed by means of synthesizer. Atmospheric cinematography and evocatively eerie ambient by cameraman Bazzeli , this was the first film shot with Arriscope anamorphic lenses, which were created for Arri by the German manufacturer Isco-Optic. Adequate production design and considerable visual and special effects . The motion picture was professionally directed by Abel Ferrara . Director Ferrara brought an entirely new approach to the Sci-Fi field to a well known story that has been shot various times . He filmed an attractive tale and it has emerged as an acceptable Sci-Fi thriller that brings astonishing nightmares . Lovers of the thriller/chiller should no miss this considerable Sci-Fi , everybody will have fun being scared by this expertly crafted film . Other versions about this known story are the following : a post-McCarthy paranoid fantasy epic titled &uml;Invasion of the body snatchers&uml; (1958), stunning and frightening adaptation which emerged as a cinema classic which achieved tremendous and unexpected success on its appearance , so well tuned for the times that some saw it a parable Communist Witch Hunts ; being compellingly directed by Donald Siegel with Kevin MacCarthy , Dana Wynter , Larry Gates , Carolyn Jones , and Sam Peckinpah ; 1978 new version also titled &uml;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&uml; , one of few instances where a remake is an improvement on the original , directed by Philip Kauffman with Donald Sutherland , Brooke Adams and features cameos by Don Siegel and Kevin McCarthy from the original , realized with great originality in spite of being a remake concerning again about mysterious seeds duplicating people . Lately recent version that results to be the least satisfactory and yet another inferior titled &uml;Invasion&uml; with Daniel Craig, Nicole Kidman , Jeffrey Wright and directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel , this so-so take on , it takes advantage of the advances in FX , sound technology and some interesting visual effects .

    The third version of Jack Finney's solid novel is a minor improvement on the previous remake, but whereas the superior 1956 original had a slow build-up and an eerie atmosphere, this one relies on gooey effects rather than suspense. The alien invasion occurs this time on a military base, where teenager Gabrielle Anwar and pilot Billy Wirth uncover a plot that jumps jerkily forward rather than slowly letting us know that something's up. The '56 version really made me feel sorry for poor old Kevin McCarthy as the pods closed in on him, but there's no claustrophobia here. One or two spooky scenes - the kids' identical finger paintings, for instance - are atypical of the otherwise flat manner in which the movie squanders its plot.

    Abel Ferrara is a talented and interesting director. He's made some great films ("bad lieutenant", "china girl") and he always seems to bring out the best in his actors. With "Body Snatchers", Ferrara tackles the task of directing a big budget, studio sci-fi film. And for the most part, he succeeds. Ferrara injects the film with tight closeups and experiments with tilted and off balanced framing. Making the viewer feel like something in the film is off and eschewed. But the film just isn't that exciting. It's more of a slow burner. It never really lives up to it's own potential sadly. But the effects are solid and some of the semi-transformation scenes are disturbing. The acting for the most part is solid with Meg Tilly giving the best monologue in the film. Gabrielle Anwar is gorgeous to stare at and Billy Wirth (Lost Boys) plays the chopper pilot hero. It could have been a better film, but "Body Snatchers" is entertaining, well-acted, and often creepy. I'm always surprised that an independent director like Ferrara was the guy chosen to helm such a big budget studio film...

    Body Snatchers is a scary movie about aliens replacing human beings with emotionless duplicates. The creepy thing is, people don't even notice because it's all happening on an army base. The star of Body Snatchers is Gabrielle Anwar, who plays a teenage girl named Marti. Marti resents her family. Her dad drags them all off to this army base because he works for the EPA and needs to inspect their hazardous materials. As events unfold Marti becomes concerned about her step brother, who witnesses something really disturbing and is obviously very afraid. But Marti's father is nagging her more and more. When she stays out late with a handsome chopper pilot they have a big argument and she is distracted from the problems of her little brother. When she does have the chance, she tries to reassure her brother that all is well...but she soon discovers it isn't. The base is being run by the Body Snatchers. And they want to finish the job of replacing all the humans with themselves. So she and her family have to run for it. The movie is very creepy and suspenseful and has a couple of shocking surprises. When it comes to horror films, I can be a bit of a wimp. I prefer more of the heroes to escape than sometimes make it. But Body Snatchers is up there with the best sci-fi thrillers in it's realistic treatment of bizarre events. It may not be completely logical, but it is smart. If anything, it's main weakness might be that it's so short. I suppose it had to be because if aliens are running an army base what can anyone do about it but get the heck out of there and hope they can save their family and friends in the process? Ultimately, I'm sort of grateful for this movie because it isn't a slasher film. It isn't an overblown alien invasion film with silly action scenes. It takes the subtle approach. It's almost like a really good X-files episode in that way (and I mean that as a compliment). The most dangerous aliens are the sneaky kind that infiltrate our society, not the ones who blow up recognizable landmarks with laser canons.

    Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an extraordinary film insomuch as its invasion narrative stands up to multiple interpretations that include anti- communism, McCarthyism (pro and con), miscegenation, anti-fordism, cultural conformity, and so on. Despite its many treasures and iconic status, there is just a bit too much emphasis placed on Siegel's version when it comes to considering the various remakes. Kauffman's 1978 version is my personal favourite as it turns San Francisco, the flower-power capital of late 60s free love and counter-culture into an Orwellian metropolis where mental health is precarious, individuation is outlawed and an absence of passion is normalised. I'm also a fan of Denny Zeitlin's creepy synth score, Kevin McCarthy's wink-wink cameo (knocked down by taxi driving Siegel, no less), and the introduction of that iconic other-worldly scream when a human is spotted - which was so effective it was incorporated in to the two subsequent remakes. Abel Ferarra's subversive version came hot on the heals of Operation Desert Storm where we saw invasion and counter-invasion televised pretty much 24/7 as the nation rallied around its troops and televisions. Ferrera's film is perhaps the most incendiary version as it dares to question USA's ubiquitous military culture driven by intense paranoia. No longer do we see the occasional man in uniform on an urban street. Rather, Ferrara reverses things, staging the action on an army base so that now we only see occasional citizens among scores of soldiers - and this creates a creepy us-and-them atmosphere from the outset. This invasion does not come from without, but from within as the line that separates soldier from citizen is erased. This makes Ferrara's film nothing like the "original" but a wholly unique and original work that stands on its own. Ferarra's version provides such a damning critique of a rarely challenged aspect of American culture that it's no wonder so many have dismissed it, picking on superficial elements and dated production values in preference to actually taking it seriously.

But scene after individual scene reeks of psychological implausibility and lazy writing. To choose just one example among many, take the little game of "Never" played by Anwar and the young soldier she is falling in love with. This "truth-or-dare"-type game is clearly a device to accellerate the process of the two characters' becoming intimate with one another. But the staging of the moments of "discovery of the other's secrets" is hopelessly artificial. We are asked to believe, for example, that the young girl played by Anwar would be shocked and moved to discover that the answer to the question "Have you ever shot someone?" is "Yes" - when it is put to a serving member of the US armed forces! This painfully artificial scene is pretty representative of the artificiality and uninspiredness of the whole film. As I say, another reason to ask: what the hell does anyone SEE in Abel Ferrara?

    Over the years several 'The Body Snatchers' movies were made. Non of them were much alike really and they are set at different places with different characters each time. This version of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is certainly not as bad as its reputation and as a matter of fact is actually a quite good genre movie on its own. This time events are taking place at a military base. The concept is still the same though, in which in alien invasion takes place by letting mysterious pods replicate and killing human bodies in their sleep. The pods look like an exact copy of their victim but of course they are not. In my opinion the story behind 'The Body Snatchers' has always been one of the most original and best ones, concerning movies dealing with an alien invasion. Its concept provide the movie with plenty of tension and also mystery, especially when you have not seen a 'The Body Snatchers' movie before. This particular movie version does also handle its concept well. It's not as great as the previous two movie version of it but it still has plenty of good moments and originality of its own in it. It's certainly better and way more exciting to watch than the 2007 movie version, starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. I still wished this movie had some of those great actors in it. There are some good actors in this movie but they play secondary characters, such as is the case with R. Lee Ermey and Forest Whitaker. The main parts are being played by some big unknowns, who aren't really charismatic or likable enough. A missed opportunity. A good, different version of the well known story. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Whilst waiting with anticipation for Abel Ferrara's King of New York to arrive in the post,I looked at his film listings on IMDb and I spotted this film,which I have seen being sold at some of the DVD shops near me. The main thing that caught my eye was,for a film that got pushed onto being a straight to video title in the UK by Warners,is,that it is a very well shot film,with an interesting story and a strong cast. The plot: The Malone family move to a military compound so that the husband/dad (Steve Malone) can do test on the soil and water in the area.This is due to some of the people in the area going "crazy" and becoming very paranoid ,and constantly saying that aliens are taking over the human race. Though the family first think that they have moved to a nice area,Their young son starts to think that something very wrong is happening.At his school,he notices that all the other children are painting the exact same picture identically!.Sadly for him,the problems don't stay at school ,when he realises that his mum is acting very strangely,which leads him to start telling the rest of the family that "Mummys dead".At first,they all think that he is being a very nasty kid.However,the older sister starts to think that he maybe telling the truth,when she wakes up to discover some that some extremely disturbing creatures have invaded there house. View on the film; When the credits flashed on the screen,listing the people that wrote the story and the screenplay to the film,I was very pleased to see the very talented Larry Cohen and Stuart Gordon being listed as two of the people that wrote the film.Whilst the stunning 1956 and the 1978 versions of the Body Snatchers,had a strong subtext about Communism (the 56 version)or,a post-Watergate America (the 78 version),this version has a very strong Stephen King/X-Files feel.The first part of the film is spent building the characters up and giving them some depth.The film also does a great job at tapping into a government/military Trust-No- One paranoia.This is done by setting most the film on an army base,that has some very strong overtones of being based on the infamous Area 51. From almost the first few minutes of the film,my reaction to Abel Ferrars direction,was one of complete amazement.Whilst most film makers would have made this film in a rush,and have turned it into a bad B- Movie (espicaly with all the trouble that Warners were giving Ferrara about the film.)Instead,Abel shoots the film in a fantastic way,with some surprisingly impressive camera moves,a very daring ending (an ending,that the legendary director Don Siegel originally wanted for his version of the Body Snatchers,until the studio told him to go for a more "optimistic" ending instead)and by doing a great job at building up the tension,as the last remaining humans try to escape the unstoppable invasion. Final view on the film: A great sci-fi thriller,with a strong story and excellent direction by Abel Ferrara.

    Acceptable Sci-Fi picture which achieved a moderated success on its appearance and dealing with a teenage girl and her father discover alien clones are replacing humans on a remote U.S. military base in Alabama . This is a passable rendition starred by a good cast such as Forest Whitaker , Meg Tilly, Terry Kinney and Gabriella Anwar . It is an average budget version , though sometimes slow-paced and including some jolts of horror . Science Fiction , military and fantasy is presented in its most horrifying form . A genuinely frightening , chilling exercise in nightmare dislocation in which hideous creatures from outer space arrive on Earth with plans of conquest by means of pods and being freely based upon a novel by Jack Finney . There are not monsters only the residents of a military headquarter , as their wills , minds and bodies taken over by a weird form of life from outer space . This is the third adaptation , still very scary and creepy about a vintage novel deals with some military residents who are being replaced by duplicates hatched from weird pods . It creates an altering the human behaviour in the new invaders . As a doctor (Terry Kinney) must protect his daughter (significant role for gorgeous Gabriella Anwar) and her new stepmother (Meg Tilly), and soon aware that pods from outer space are duplicating and menacing everyone there . Meantime , the teenager daughter befriends a handsome attack helicopter pilot, Tim Young (Billy Wirth) and a young girl named Jenn Platt (Christine Elise) , daughter of headquarter commander (Lee Ermey). The doctor may hold the means to avoid the extraterrestrial invasion as he discovers their friends are being taking over by cold human-duplicates , as one by one are turned into aliens . While examining specimen, Doctor Malone is approached by angst-ridden Major Collins (Forrest Whitaker), who asks him about psychological effects particularly narcophobia . The mysterious epidemic from outer space is spread along military camp , everybody are being taken over by emotionless , cold behaving beings . The strange seeds from outer space are growing and destroying a little base at an alarming attack. This scary Sci-Fi displays a tense screenplay freely based on Jack Finney novel titled &uml;Body snatchers&uml; that can be considered truly disturbing . Packs eerie suspense , chills , thrills , spectacular scenes , chilly events and pretty turns and twists . A ceaselessly inventive , ghastly rendition of the alien take-over paradigm , including a a nice built-in paranoia about a small military base is infiltrated by pods from outer space that replace and replicate human beings . It profits from an intense acting by Terry Kenney , Forrest Whitaker , R. Lee Ermey along with an enjoyable Gabrielle Anwar ; furthermore , a right direction by Abel Ferrra who proved himself master of the eerie clutch at the base of one's spine . Appropriately exciting and frightening musical score by Joe Delia , though composed by means of synthesizer. Atmospheric cinematography and evocatively eerie ambient by cameraman Bazzeli , this was the first film shot with Arriscope anamorphic lenses, which were created for Arri by the German manufacturer Isco-Optic. Adequate production design and considerable visual and special effects . The motion picture was professionally directed by Abel Ferrara . Director Ferrara brought an entirely new approach to the Sci-Fi field to a well known story that has been shot various times . He filmed an attractive tale and it has emerged as an acceptable Sci-Fi thriller that brings astonishing nightmares . Lovers of the thriller/chiller should no miss this considerable Sci-Fi , everybody will have fun being scared by this expertly crafted film . Other versions about this known story are the following : a post-McCarthy paranoid fantasy epic titled &uml;Invasion of the body snatchers&uml; (1958), stunning and frightening adaptation which emerged as a cinema classic which achieved tremendous and unexpected success on its appearance , so well tuned for the times that some saw it a parable Communist Witch Hunts ; being compellingly directed by Donald Siegel with Kevin MacCarthy , Dana Wynter , Larry Gates , Carolyn Jones , and Sam Peckinpah ; 1978 new version also titled &uml;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&uml; , one of few instances where a remake is an improvement on the original , directed by Philip Kauffman with Donald Sutherland , Brooke Adams and features cameos by Don Siegel and Kevin McCarthy from the original , realized with great originality in spite of being a remake concerning again about mysterious seeds duplicating people . Lately recent version that results to be the least satisfactory and yet another inferior titled &uml;Invasion&uml; with Daniel Craig, Nicole Kidman , Jeffrey Wright and directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel , this so-so take on , it takes advantage of the advances in FX , sound technology and some interesting visual effects .

    The third version of Jack Finney's solid novel is a minor improvement on the previous remake, but whereas the superior 1956 original had a slow build-up and an eerie atmosphere, this one relies on gooey effects rather than suspense. The alien invasion occurs this time on a military base, where teenager Gabrielle Anwar and pilot Billy Wirth uncover a plot that jumps jerkily forward rather than slowly letting us know that something's up. The '56 version really made me feel sorry for poor old Kevin McCarthy as the pods closed in on him, but there's no claustrophobia here. One or two spooky scenes - the kids' identical finger paintings, for instance - are atypical of the otherwise flat manner in which the movie squanders its plot.

    Abel Ferrara is a talented and interesting director. He's made some great films ("bad lieutenant", "china girl") and he always seems to bring out the best in his actors. With "Body Snatchers", Ferrara tackles the task of directing a big budget, studio sci-fi film. And for the most part, he succeeds. Ferrara injects the film with tight closeups and experiments with tilted and off balanced framing. Making the viewer feel like something in the film is off and eschewed. But the film just isn't that exciting. It's more of a slow burner. It never really lives up to it's own potential sadly. But the effects are solid and some of the semi-transformation scenes are disturbing. The acting for the most part is solid with Meg Tilly giving the best monologue in the film. Gabrielle Anwar is gorgeous to stare at and Billy Wirth (Lost Boys) plays the chopper pilot hero. It could have been a better film, but "Body Snatchers" is entertaining, well-acted, and often creepy. I'm always surprised that an independent director like Ferrara was the guy chosen to helm such a big budget studio film...

    Body Snatchers is a scary movie about aliens replacing human beings with emotionless duplicates. The creepy thing is, people don't even notice because it's all happening on an army base. The star of Body Snatchers is Gabrielle Anwar, who plays a teenage girl named Marti. Marti resents her family. Her dad drags them all off to this army base because he works for the EPA and needs to inspect their hazardous materials. As events unfold Marti becomes concerned about her step brother, who witnesses something really disturbing and is obviously very afraid. But Marti's father is nagging her more and more. When she stays out late with a handsome chopper pilot they have a big argument and she is distracted from the problems of her little brother. When she does have the chance, she tries to reassure her brother that all is well...but she soon discovers it isn't. The base is being run by the Body Snatchers. And they want to finish the job of replacing all the humans with themselves. So she and her family have to run for it. The movie is very creepy and suspenseful and has a couple of shocking surprises. When it comes to horror films, I can be a bit of a wimp. I prefer more of the heroes to escape than sometimes make it. But Body Snatchers is up there with the best sci-fi thrillers in it's realistic treatment of bizarre events. It may not be completely logical, but it is smart. If anything, it's main weakness might be that it's so short. I suppose it had to be because if aliens are running an army base what can anyone do about it but get the heck out of there and hope they can save their family and friends in the process? Ultimately, I'm sort of grateful for this movie because it isn't a slasher film. It isn't an overblown alien invasion film with silly action scenes. It takes the subtle approach. It's almost like a really good X-files episode in that way (and I mean that as a compliment). The most dangerous aliens are the sneaky kind that infiltrate our society, not the ones who blow up recognizable landmarks with laser canons.

    Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an extraordinary film insomuch as its invasion narrative stands up to multiple interpretations that include anti- communism, McCarthyism (pro and con), miscegenation, anti-fordism, cultural conformity, and so on. Despite its many treasures and iconic status, there is just a bit too much emphasis placed on Siegel's version when it comes to considering the various remakes. Kauffman's 1978 version is my personal favourite as it turns San Francisco, the flower-power capital of late 60s free love and counter-culture into an Orwellian metropolis where mental health is precarious, individuation is outlawed and an absence of passion is normalised. I'm also a fan of Denny Zeitlin's creepy synth score, Kevin McCarthy's wink-wink cameo (knocked down by taxi driving Siegel, no less), and the introduction of that iconic other-worldly scream when a human is spotted - which was so effective it was incorporated in to the two subsequent remakes. Abel Ferarra's subversive version came hot on the heals of Operation Desert Storm where we saw invasion and counter-invasion televised pretty much 24/7 as the nation rallied around its troops and televisions. Ferrera's film is perhaps the most incendiary version as it dares to question USA's ubiquitous military culture driven by intense paranoia. No longer do we see the occasional man in uniform on an urban street. Rather, Ferrara reverses things, staging the action on an army base so that now we only see occasional citizens among scores of soldiers - and this creates a creepy us-and-them atmosphere from the outset. This invasion does not come from without, but from within as the line that separates soldier from citizen is erased. This makes Ferrara's film nothing like the "original" but a wholly unique and original work that stands on its own. Ferarra's version provides such a damning critique of a rarely challenged aspect of American culture that it's no wonder so many have dismissed it, picking on superficial elements and dated production values in preference to actually taking it seriously.

    Ferrara made spiritual what Kaufman made satirical what Siegel made political: The invasion hasn't been thwarted, it's merely waiting on the right filmmaker every twenty years for passionate revision. Were there to be a "re-remake" of Jack Finney's pulpy source who better to attempt it than Ferrara, the hysterical director of Bad Lieutenant, King of New York and a slew of other overwrought films? I mean, discernment and restraint are the last things a third Body Snatchers required. However, they're the tendency of this slick but uninspired version. It could've been wheeled by any bland director who knows how to point a camera and resist affronting or disturbing anyone. Don Siegel's Invasion virtually declared McCarthyism the emblematic gist behind the obedient body snatchers. Ferrara probably didn't want to bother anatomizing the '50s fear politics with those, if any, of the '90s, and knew that the premise was well-known even to viewers who'd never seen the first two versions. So he's short and snappy. In the first 5 minutes, a frenzied soldier traps the alienated teenage daughter of the EPA agent protagonist in a gas station bathroom, lunging from the dark to present the distraught forewarning, "They're out there. They get you when you sleep." Nothing that ensues approaches that opening shove. Some tilted camera angles and some misty lighting are the only tinges of Ferrara's excessively melodramatic style, except perhaps Meg Tilly's chilling turn. This talent-filled interpretation boosts its creepiest dashes from the 1978 version: the tentacles that slither out of the pods, the way the pod people draw attention to humans and unleash a mechanical-seeming screech. But this third of four adaptations of the 1955 novel doesn't impart Phil Kaufman's film's feeling one can enjoy from the right kind of horror or sci-fi movie that makes you just want to snuggle up in front of the TV late at night or on a really rainy or snowy day, everything you need in arm's reach of the couch and ottoman, and lose yourself in it's eerily fun atmosphere. And there is merely a hazy recognition of lots of other superior horror material that Ferrara's anamorphically shot sci-fi thriller calls to mind. The opening credits indiscreetly recall The Twilight Zone. One teary mother echoes The Stepford Wives. The worry of sleep, which was in the original film, has since been declared by the Elm Street series. Ferrara and his capable writers fellow exploitation veteran Larry Cohen and uniquely Bohemian horror director Stuart Gordon must've understood this, but there's no lighthearted drollness about these loans.

    Marti Malone (Gabreielle Anwar) is a beautiful but lonely teenager. Who is forced to go with his father Steve (Terry Kinney), his step-mother Carol (Meg Tilly) and her half-brother Andy (Reilly Murphy) travel to a remote Military Base in Alabama. Slowly, Marti and Andy discovers that things in this Military Base are not what they seemed. Civilians and Soldiers are acting-alike and they are humorless (Not to mention Soulless). Now the family find themselves in danger and you can't trust no one. The only thing, you can do to save yourself is to not fall asleep. Directed by Abel Ferrara (China Girl, The Funeral, King of New York) made an interesting, sometimes fascinating Science-Fiction thriller with good performances. The Special Effects are good, expect for one sequence towards the end in the helicopter. Tilly gets the most memorable, important lines of dialogue during one eerie scene is the most effective of the movie. "Body Snatchers" was unfortunately an box office disappointment, since Warner Bros didn't know how to market the picture. Despite some very good reviews from film critics, especially Roger Ebert. This movie was out in limited released instead but the film did have an cult following on video. DVD has an grainy anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an strong Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD has no special features. Oscar-Winner:Forest Whitaker has an bit part as a Military Doctor. This is the third adaptation of "Body Snatchers" and probably the least known of the four adaptations. Still, this version is better than the last adaptation, "The Invasion". The problem with the third version, the feature is somewhat too short of a real satisfaction but the real mistake was setting this at the Military Base, where everyone acts alike was not an good idea. Still, "Body Snatchers" is strong enough to overcome these flaws. Farrara's film is certainly well made but as a science-fiction thriller is joyless to say the least. Screen-Story by Raymond Cistheri and Larry Cohen (A Return to Salem's Lot, Phone Booth, Q:The Wigned Serpent). Screenplay by Staurt Gordon (Fortress, Re-Animator, Stuck), Dennis Paoli (Castle Freak, The Dentist, The Pit and the Pendulum) and Nicolas St. John (The Addiction, Dangerous Game, Fear City). Some die-hard fans of this version, imagine what professional "B" movie filmmaker:Gordon could have done with this third adaptation. Arriscope. (****/*****).

    Every time I watch an Abel Ferrara movie, I keep hoping that I will finally begin to understand why he is considered by so many to be an interesting and original independent film-maker. And each time I become more baffled as to how anyone ever got the idea of esteeming him so highly. Admittedly, a SECOND remake of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" would have been a tough job for even a genuinely brilliant director to pull off successfully, given that both the original and the first remake were both excellent, subtle, complex movies in their own right. But Ferrara and his scriptwriter seem to ruin their own slim chances from the very outset - above all through the almost incomprehensibly dumb and clumsy decision to set this version on a military base, of all places. Both Siegel's original version and Kaufman's first remake had given themselves a chance to draw on that deepest source of terror - ambiguity - by setting their movies in environments that were innocuous and even comforting on the surface: the generic American "small town" of the 1950s and the affluent libertarian paradise of 1970s San Francisco. What a crazy casting-away of this important resource to set the story in an army camp - an environment which is bristling with menace and alienation even when there is NO sinister alien force at work in it! The scenes with glassy-eyed soldiers in Ferrara's film understandably produce absolutely nothing of the unsettling effect of the scenes of glassy-eyed San Franciscan store-clerks and dentists in Kaufman's - for the simple reason that a soldier is MEANT to be glassy-eyed! Even on the "micro"-level, though, the script is a disaster - another cheap and shoddy piece of work from Nicholas St. John which really makes one wonder why Ferrara works so consistently with this hack. The voice-over given to Gabrielle Anwar is embarrassingly lacking in subtlety - "If we had known what was going to happen, we would have run..." - and appears to be intended to try to generate a tension that the action itself fails to generate. But scene after individual scene reeks of psychological implausibility and lazy writing. To choose just one example among many, take the little game of "Never" played by Anwar and the young soldier she is falling in love with. This "truth-or-dare"-type game is clearly a device to accellerate the process of the two characters' becoming intimate with one another. But the staging of the moments of "discovery of the other's secrets" is hopelessly artificial. We are asked to believe, for example, that the young girl played by Anwar would be shocked and moved to discover that the answer to the question "Have you ever shot someone?" is "Yes" - when it is put to a serving member of the US armed forces! This painfully artificial scene is pretty representative of the artificiality and uninspiredness of the whole film. As I say, another reason to ask: what the hell does anyone SEE in Abel Ferrara?

    The third version of Jack Finney's solid novel is a minor improvement on the previous remake, but whereas the superior 1956 original had a slow build-up and an eerie atmosphere, this one relies on gooey effects rather than suspense. The alien invasion occurs this time on a military base, where teenager Gabrielle Anwar and pilot Billy Wirth uncover a plot that jumps jerkily forward rather than slowly letting us know that something's up. The '56 version really made me feel sorry for poor old Kevin McCarthy as the pods closed in on him, but there's no claustrophobia here. One or two spooky scenes - the kids' identical finger paintings, for instance - are atypical of the otherwise flat manner in which the movie squanders its plot.

    Abel Ferrara is a talented and interesting director. He's made some great films ("bad lieutenant", "china girl") and he always seems to bring out the best in his actors. With "Body Snatchers", Ferrara tackles the task of directing a big budget, studio sci-fi film. And for the most part, he succeeds. Ferrara injects the film with tight closeups and experiments with tilted and off balanced framing. Making the viewer feel like something in the film is off and eschewed. But the film just isn't that exciting. It's more of a slow burner. It never really lives up to it's own potential sadly. But the effects are solid and some of the semi-transformation scenes are disturbing. The acting for the most part is solid with Meg Tilly giving the best monologue in the film. Gabrielle Anwar is gorgeous to stare at and Billy Wirth (Lost Boys) plays the chopper pilot hero. It could have been a better film, but "Body Snatchers" is entertaining, well-acted, and often creepy. I'm always surprised that an independent director like Ferrara was the guy chosen to helm such a big budget studio film...

    Body Snatchers is a scary movie about aliens replacing human beings with emotionless duplicates. The creepy thing is, people don't even notice because it's all happening on an army base. The star of Body Snatchers is Gabrielle Anwar, who plays a teenage girl named Marti. Marti resents her family. Her dad drags them all off to this army base because he works for the EPA and needs to inspect their hazardous materials. As events unfold Marti becomes concerned about her step brother, who witnesses something really disturbing and is obviously very afraid. But Marti's father is nagging her more and more. When she stays out late with a handsome chopper pilot they have a big argument and she is distracted from the problems of her little brother. When she does have the chance, she tries to reassure her brother that all is well...but she soon discovers it isn't. The base is being run by the Body Snatchers. And they want to finish the job of replacing all the humans with themselves. So she and her family have to run for it. The movie is very creepy and suspenseful and has a couple of shocking surprises. When it comes to horror films, I can be a bit of a wimp. I prefer more of the heroes to escape than sometimes make it. But Body Snatchers is up there with the best sci-fi thrillers in it's realistic treatment of bizarre events. It may not be completely logical, but it is smart. If anything, it's main weakness might be that it's so short. I suppose it had to be because if aliens are running an army base what can anyone do about it but get the heck out of there and hope they can save their family and friends in the process? Ultimately, I'm sort of grateful for this movie because it isn't a slasher film. It isn't an overblown alien invasion film with silly action scenes. It takes the subtle approach. It's almost like a really good X-files episode in that way (and I mean that as a compliment). The most dangerous aliens are the sneaky kind that infiltrate our society, not the ones who blow up recognizable landmarks with laser canons.

    Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an extraordinary film insomuch as its invasion narrative stands up to multiple interpretations that include anti- communism, McCarthyism (pro and con), miscegenation, anti-fordism, cultural conformity, and so on. Despite its many treasures and iconic status, there is just a bit too much emphasis placed on Siegel's version when it comes to considering the various remakes. Kauffman's 1978 version is my personal favourite as it turns San Francisco, the flower-power capital of late 60s free love and counter-culture into an Orwellian metropolis where mental health is precarious, individuation is outlawed and an absence of passion is normalised. I'm also a fan of Denny Zeitlin's creepy synth score, Kevin McCarthy's wink-wink cameo (knocked down by taxi driving Siegel, no less), and the introduction of that iconic other-worldly scream when a human is spotted - which was so effective it was incorporated in to the two subsequent remakes. Abel Ferarra's subversive version came hot on the heals of Operation Desert Storm where we saw invasion and counter-invasion televised pretty much 24/7 as the nation rallied around its troops and televisions. Ferrera's film is perhaps the most incendiary version as it dares to question USA's ubiquitous military culture driven by intense paranoia. No longer do we see the occasional man in uniform on an urban street. Rather, Ferrara reverses things, staging the action on an army base so that now we only see occasional citizens among scores of soldiers - and this creates a creepy us-and-them atmosphere from the outset. This invasion does not come from without, but from within as the line that separates soldier from citizen is erased. This makes Ferrara's film nothing like the "original" but a wholly unique and original work that stands on its own. Ferarra's version provides such a damning critique of a rarely challenged aspect of American culture that it's no wonder so many have dismissed it, picking on superficial elements and dated production values in preference to actually taking it seriously.

    Ferrara made spiritual what Kaufman made satirical what Siegel made political: The invasion hasn't been thwarted, it's merely waiting on the right filmmaker every twenty years for passionate revision. Were there to be a "re-remake" of Jack Finney's pulpy source who better to attempt it than Ferrara, the hysterical director of Bad Lieutenant, King of New York and a slew of other overwrought films? I mean, discernment and restraint are the last things a third Body Snatchers required. However, they're the tendency of this slick but uninspired version. It could've been wheeled by any bland director who knows how to point a camera and resist affronting or disturbing anyone. Don Siegel's Invasion virtually declared McCarthyism the emblematic gist behind the obedient body snatchers. Ferrara probably didn't want to bother anatomizing the '50s fear politics with those, if any, of the '90s, and knew that the premise was well-known even to viewers who'd never seen the first two versions. So he's short and snappy. In the first 5 minutes, a frenzied soldier traps the alienated teenage daughter of the EPA agent protagonist in a gas station bathroom, lunging from the dark to present the distraught forewarning, "They're out there. They get you when you sleep." Nothing that ensues approaches that opening shove. Some tilted camera angles and some misty lighting are the only tinges of Ferrara's excessively melodramatic style, except perhaps Meg Tilly's chilling turn. This talent-filled interpretation boosts its creepiest dashes from the 1978 version: the tentacles that slither out of the pods, the way the pod people draw attention to humans and unleash a mechanical-seeming screech. But this third of four adaptations of the 1955 novel doesn't impart Phil Kaufman's film's feeling one can enjoy from the right kind of horror or sci-fi movie that makes you just want to snuggle up in front of the TV late at night or on a really rainy or snowy day, everything you need in arm's reach of the couch and ottoman, and lose yourself in it's eerily fun atmosphere. And there is merely a hazy recognition of lots of other superior horror material that Ferrara's anamorphically shot sci-fi thriller calls to mind. The opening credits indiscreetly recall The Twilight Zone. One teary mother echoes The Stepford Wives. The worry of sleep, which was in the original film, has since been declared by the Elm Street series. Ferrara and his capable writers fellow exploitation veteran Larry Cohen and uniquely Bohemian horror director Stuart Gordon must've understood this, but there's no lighthearted drollness about these loans.

    Marti Malone (Gabreielle Anwar) is a beautiful but lonely teenager. Who is forced to go with his father Steve (Terry Kinney), his step-mother Carol (Meg Tilly) and her half-brother Andy (Reilly Murphy) travel to a remote Military Base in Alabama. Slowly, Marti and Andy discovers that things in this Military Base are not what they seemed. Civilians and Soldiers are acting-alike and they are humorless (Not to mention Soulless). Now the family find themselves in danger and you can't trust no one. The only thing, you can do to save yourself is to not fall asleep. Directed by Abel Ferrara (China Girl, The Funeral, King of New York) made an interesting, sometimes fascinating Science-Fiction thriller with good performances. The Special Effects are good, expect for one sequence towards the end in the helicopter. Tilly gets the most memorable, important lines of dialogue during one eerie scene is the most effective of the movie. "Body Snatchers" was unfortunately an box office disappointment, since Warner Bros didn't know how to market the picture. Despite some very good reviews from film critics, especially Roger Ebert. This movie was out in limited released instead but the film did have an cult following on video. DVD has an grainy anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an strong Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD has no special features. Oscar-Winner:Forest Whitaker has an bit part as a Military Doctor. This is the third adaptation of "Body Snatchers" and probably the least known of the four adaptations. Still, this version is better than the last adaptation, "The Invasion". The problem with the third version, the feature is somewhat too short of a real satisfaction but the real mistake was setting this at the Military Base, where everyone acts alike was not an good idea. Still, "Body Snatchers" is strong enough to overcome these flaws. Farrara's film is certainly well made but as a science-fiction thriller is joyless to say the least. Screen-Story by Raymond Cistheri and Larry Cohen (A Return to Salem's Lot, Phone Booth, Q:The Wigned Serpent). Screenplay by Staurt Gordon (Fortress, Re-Animator, Stuck), Dennis Paoli (Castle Freak, The Dentist, The Pit and the Pendulum) and Nicolas St. John (The Addiction, Dangerous Game, Fear City). Some die-hard fans of this version, imagine what professional "B" movie filmmaker:Gordon could have done with this third adaptation. Arriscope. (****/*****).

    Every time I watch an Abel Ferrara movie, I keep hoping that I will finally begin to understand why he is considered by so many to be an interesting and original independent film-maker. And each time I become more baffled as to how anyone ever got the idea of esteeming him so highly. Admittedly, a SECOND remake of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" would have been a tough job for even a genuinely brilliant director to pull off successfully, given that both the original and the first remake were both excellent, subtle, complex movies in their own right. But Ferrara and his scriptwriter seem to ruin their own slim chances from the very outset - above all through the almost incomprehensibly dumb and clumsy decision to set this version on a military base, of all places. Both Siegel's original version and Kaufman's first remake had given themselves a chance to draw on that deepest source of terror - ambiguity - by setting their movies in environments that were innocuous and even comforting on the surface: the generic American "small town" of the 1950s and the affluent libertarian paradise of 1970s San Francisco. What a crazy casting-away of this important resource to set the story in an army camp - an environment which is bristling with menace and alienation even when there is NO sinister alien force at work in it! The scenes with glassy-eyed soldiers in Ferrara's film understandably produce absolutely nothing of the unsettling effect of the scenes of glassy-eyed San Franciscan store-clerks and dentists in Kaufman's - for the simple reason that a soldier is MEANT to be glassy-eyed! Even on the "micro"-level, though, the script is a disaster - another cheap and shoddy piece of work from Nicholas St. John which really makes one wonder why Ferrara works so consistently with this hack. The voice-over given to Gabrielle Anwar is embarrassingly lacking in subtlety - "If we had known what was going to happen, we would have run..." - and appears to be intended to try to generate a tension that the action itself fails to generate. But scene after individual scene reeks of psychological implausibility and lazy writing. To choose just one example among many, take the little game of "Never" played by Anwar and the young soldier she is falling in love with. This "truth-or-dare"-type game is clearly a device to accellerate the process of the two characters' becoming intimate with one another. But the staging of the moments of "discovery of the other's secrets" is hopelessly artificial. We are asked to believe, for example, that the young girl played by Anwar would be shocked and moved to discover that the answer to the question "Have you ever shot someone?" is "Yes" - when it is put to a serving member of the US armed forces! This painfully artificial scene is pretty representative of the artificiality and uninspiredness of the whole film. As I say, another reason to ask: what the hell does anyone SEE in Abel Ferrara?

    Over the years several 'The Body Snatchers' movies were made. Non of them were much alike really and they are set at different places with different characters each time. This version of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is certainly not as bad as its reputation and as a matter of fact is actually a quite good genre movie on its own. This time events are taking place at a military base. The concept is still the same though, in which in alien invasion takes place by letting mysterious pods replicate and killing human bodies in their sleep. The pods look like an exact copy of their victim but of course they are not. In my opinion the story behind 'The Body Snatchers' has always been one of the most original and best ones, concerning movies dealing with an alien invasion. Its concept provide the movie with plenty of tension and also mystery, especially when you have not seen a 'The Body Snatchers' movie before. This particular movie version does also handle its concept well. It's not as great as the previous two movie version of it but it still has plenty of good moments and originality of its own in it. It's certainly better and way more exciting to watch than the 2007 movie version, starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. I still wished this movie had some of those great actors in it. There are some good actors in this movie but they play secondary characters, such as is the case with R. Lee Ermey and Forest Whitaker. The main parts are being played by some big unknowns, who aren't really charismatic or likable enough. A missed opportunity. A good, different version of the well known story. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Whilst waiting with anticipation for Abel Ferrara's King of New York to arrive in the post,I looked at his film listings on IMDb and I spotted this film,which I have seen being sold at some of the DVD shops near me. The main thing that caught my eye was,for a film that got pushed onto being a straight to video title in the UK by Warners,is,that it is a very well shot film,with an interesting story and a strong cast. The plot: The Malone family move to a military compound so that the husband/dad (Steve Malone) can do test on the soil and water in the area.This is due to some of the people in the area going "crazy" and becoming very paranoid ,and constantly saying that aliens are taking over the human race. Though the family first think that they have moved to a nice area,Their young son starts to think that something very wrong is happening.At his school,he notices that all the other children are painting the exact same picture identically!.Sadly for him,the problems don't stay at school ,when he realises that his mum is acting very strangely,which leads him to start telling the rest of the family that "Mummys dead".At first,they all think that he is being a very nasty kid.However,the older sister starts to think that he maybe telling the truth,when she wakes up to discover some that some extremely disturbing creatures have invaded there house. View on the film; When the credits flashed on the screen,listing the people that wrote the story and the screenplay to the film,I was very pleased to see the very talented Larry Cohen and Stuart Gordon being listed as two of the people that wrote the film.Whilst the stunning 1956 and the 1978 versions of the Body Snatchers,had a strong subtext about Communism (the 56 version)or,a post-Watergate America (the 78 version),this version has a very strong Stephen King/X-Files feel.The first part of the film is spent building the characters up and giving them some depth.The film also does a great job at tapping into a government/military Trust-No- One paranoia.This is done by setting most the film on an army base,that has some very strong overtones of being based on the infamous Area 51. From almost the first few minutes of the film,my reaction to Abel Ferrars direction,was one of complete amazement.Whilst most film makers would have made this film in a rush,and have turned it into a bad B- Movie (espicaly with all the trouble that Warners were giving Ferrara about the film.)Instead,Abel shoots the film in a fantastic way,with some surprisingly impressive camera moves,a very daring ending (an ending,that the legendary director Don Siegel originally wanted for his version of the Body Snatchers,until the studio told him to go for a more "optimistic" ending instead)and by doing a great job at building up the tension,as the last remaining humans try to escape the unstoppable invasion. Final view on the film: A great sci-fi thriller,with a strong story and excellent direction by Abel Ferrara.

When she does have the chance, she tries to reassure her brother that all is well...but she soon discovers it isn't. The base is being run by the Body Snatchers. And they want to finish the job of replacing all the humans with themselves. So she and her family have to run for it. The movie is very creepy and suspenseful and has a couple of shocking surprises. When it comes to horror films, I can be a bit of a wimp. I prefer more of the heroes to escape than sometimes make it. But Body Snatchers is up there with the best sci-fi thrillers in it's realistic treatment of bizarre events. It may not be completely logical, but it is smart. If anything, it's main weakness might be that it's so short. I suppose it had to be because if aliens are running an army base what can anyone do about it but get the heck out of there and hope they can save their family and friends in the process? Ultimately, I'm sort of grateful for this movie because it isn't a slasher film. It isn't an overblown alien invasion film with silly action scenes. It takes the subtle approach. It's almost like a really good X-files episode in that way (and I mean that as a compliment). The most dangerous aliens are the sneaky kind that infiltrate our society, not the ones who blow up recognizable landmarks with laser canons.

    Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an extraordinary film insomuch as its invasion narrative stands up to multiple interpretations that include anti- communism, McCarthyism (pro and con), miscegenation, anti-fordism, cultural conformity, and so on. Despite its many treasures and iconic status, there is just a bit too much emphasis placed on Siegel's version when it comes to considering the various remakes. Kauffman's 1978 version is my personal favourite as it turns San Francisco, the flower-power capital of late 60s free love and counter-culture into an Orwellian metropolis where mental health is precarious, individuation is outlawed and an absence of passion is normalised. I'm also a fan of Denny Zeitlin's creepy synth score, Kevin McCarthy's wink-wink cameo (knocked down by taxi driving Siegel, no less), and the introduction of that iconic other-worldly scream when a human is spotted - which was so effective it was incorporated in to the two subsequent remakes. Abel Ferarra's subversive version came hot on the heals of Operation Desert Storm where we saw invasion and counter-invasion televised pretty much 24/7 as the nation rallied around its troops and televisions. Ferrera's film is perhaps the most incendiary version as it dares to question USA's ubiquitous military culture driven by intense paranoia. No longer do we see the occasional man in uniform on an urban street. Rather, Ferrara reverses things, staging the action on an army base so that now we only see occasional citizens among scores of soldiers - and this creates a creepy us-and-them atmosphere from the outset. This invasion does not come from without, but from within as the line that separates soldier from citizen is erased. This makes Ferrara's film nothing like the "original" but a wholly unique and original work that stands on its own. Ferarra's version provides such a damning critique of a rarely challenged aspect of American culture that it's no wonder so many have dismissed it, picking on superficial elements and dated production values in preference to actually taking it seriously.

    A Foggy High-Camp Recollection of Lots of Other Superior Versions

    Ferrara made spiritual what Kaufman made satirical what Siegel made political: The invasion hasn't been thwarted, it's merely waiting on the right filmmaker every twenty years for passionate revision. Were there to be a "re-remake" of Jack Finney's pulpy source who better to attempt it than Ferrara, the hysterical director of Bad Lieutenant, King of New York and a slew of other overwrought films? I mean, discernment and restraint are the last things a third Body Snatchers required. However, they're the tendency of this slick but uninspired version. It could've been wheeled by any bland director who knows how to point a camera and resist affronting or disturbing anyone. Don Siegel's Invasion virtually declared McCarthyism the emblematic gist behind the obedient body snatchers. Ferrara probably didn't want to bother anatomizing the '50s fear politics with those, if any, of the '90s, and knew that the premise was well-known even to viewers who'd never seen the first two versions. So he's short and snappy. In the first 5 minutes, a frenzied soldier traps the alienated teenage daughter of the EPA agent protagonist in a gas station bathroom, lunging from the dark to present the distraught forewarning, "They're out there. They get you when you sleep." Nothing that ensues approaches that opening shove. Some tilted camera angles and some misty lighting are the only tinges of Ferrara's excessively melodramatic style, except perhaps Meg Tilly's chilling turn. This talent-filled interpretation boosts its creepiest dashes from the 1978 version: the tentacles that slither out of the pods, the way the pod people draw attention to humans and unleash a mechanical-seeming screech. But this third of four adaptations of the 1955 novel doesn't impart Phil Kaufman's film's feeling one can enjoy from the right kind of horror or sci-fi movie that makes you just want to snuggle up in front of the TV late at night or on a really rainy or snowy day, everything you need in arm's reach of the couch and ottoman, and lose yourself in it's eerily fun atmosphere. And there is merely a hazy recognition of lots of other superior horror material that Ferrara's anamorphically shot sci-fi thriller calls to mind. The opening credits indiscreetly recall The Twilight Zone. One teary mother echoes The Stepford Wives. The worry of sleep, which was in the original film, has since been declared by the Elm Street series. Ferrara and his capable writers fellow exploitation veteran Larry Cohen and uniquely Bohemian horror director Stuart Gordon must've understood this, but there's no lighthearted drollness about these loans.

    Marti Malone (Gabreielle Anwar) is a beautiful but lonely teenager. Who is forced to go with his father Steve (Terry Kinney), his step-mother Carol (Meg Tilly) and her half-brother Andy (Reilly Murphy) travel to a remote Military Base in Alabama. Slowly, Marti and Andy discovers that things in this Military Base are not what they seemed. Civilians and Soldiers are acting-alike and they are humorless (Not to mention Soulless). Now the family find themselves in danger and you can't trust no one. The only thing, you can do to save yourself is to not fall asleep. Directed by Abel Ferrara (China Girl, The Funeral, King of New York) made an interesting, sometimes fascinating Science-Fiction thriller with good performances. The Special Effects are good, expect for one sequence towards the end in the helicopter. Tilly gets the most memorable, important lines of dialogue during one eerie scene is the most effective of the movie. "Body Snatchers" was unfortunately an box office disappointment, since Warner Bros didn't know how to market the picture. Despite some very good reviews from film critics, especially Roger Ebert. This movie was out in limited released instead but the film did have an cult following on video. DVD has an grainy anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an strong Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD has no special features. Oscar-Winner:Forest Whitaker has an bit part as a Military Doctor. This is the third adaptation of "Body Snatchers" and probably the least known of the four adaptations. Still, this version is better than the last adaptation, "The Invasion". The problem with the third version, the feature is somewhat too short of a real satisfaction but the real mistake was setting this at the Military Base, where everyone acts alike was not an good idea. Still, "Body Snatchers" is strong enough to overcome these flaws. Farrara's film is certainly well made but as a science-fiction thriller is joyless to say the least. Screen-Story by Raymond Cistheri and Larry Cohen (A Return to Salem's Lot, Phone Booth, Q:The Wigned Serpent). Screenplay by Staurt Gordon (Fortress, Re-Animator, Stuck), Dennis Paoli (Castle Freak, The Dentist, The Pit and the Pendulum) and Nicolas St. John (The Addiction, Dangerous Game, Fear City). Some die-hard fans of this version, imagine what professional "B" movie filmmaker:Gordon could have done with this third adaptation. Arriscope. (****/*****).

    Every time I watch an Abel Ferrara movie, I keep hoping that I will finally begin to understand why he is considered by so many to be an interesting and original independent film-maker. And each time I become more baffled as to how anyone ever got the idea of esteeming him so highly. Admittedly, a SECOND remake of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" would have been a tough job for even a genuinely brilliant director to pull off successfully, given that both the original and the first remake were both excellent, subtle, complex movies in their own right. But Ferrara and his scriptwriter seem to ruin their own slim chances from the very outset - above all through the almost incomprehensibly dumb and clumsy decision to set this version on a military base, of all places. Both Siegel's original version and Kaufman's first remake had given themselves a chance to draw on that deepest source of terror - ambiguity - by setting their movies in environments that were innocuous and even comforting on the surface: the generic American "small town" of the 1950s and the affluent libertarian paradise of 1970s San Francisco. What a crazy casting-away of this important resource to set the story in an army camp - an environment which is bristling with menace and alienation even when there is NO sinister alien force at work in it! The scenes with glassy-eyed soldiers in Ferrara's film understandably produce absolutely nothing of the unsettling effect of the scenes of glassy-eyed San Franciscan store-clerks and dentists in Kaufman's - for the simple reason that a soldier is MEANT to be glassy-eyed! Even on the "micro"-level, though, the script is a disaster - another cheap and shoddy piece of work from Nicholas St. John which really makes one wonder why Ferrara works so consistently with this hack. The voice-over given to Gabrielle Anwar is embarrassingly lacking in subtlety - "If we had known what was going to happen, we would have run..." - and appears to be intended to try to generate a tension that the action itself fails to generate. But scene after individual scene reeks of psychological implausibility and lazy writing. To choose just one example among many, take the little game of "Never" played by Anwar and the young soldier she is falling in love with. This "truth-or-dare"-type game is clearly a device to accellerate the process of the two characters' becoming intimate with one another. But the staging of the moments of "discovery of the other's secrets" is hopelessly artificial. We are asked to believe, for example, that the young girl played by Anwar would be shocked and moved to discover that the answer to the question "Have you ever shot someone?" is "Yes" - when it is put to a serving member of the US armed forces! This painfully artificial scene is pretty representative of the artificiality and uninspiredness of the whole film. As I say, another reason to ask: what the hell does anyone SEE in Abel Ferrara?

    Over the years several 'The Body Snatchers' movies were made. Non of them were much alike really and they are set at different places with different characters each time. This version of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is certainly not as bad as its reputation and as a matter of fact is actually a quite good genre movie on its own. This time events are taking place at a military base. The concept is still the same though, in which in alien invasion takes place by letting mysterious pods replicate and killing human bodies in their sleep. The pods look like an exact copy of their victim but of course they are not. In my opinion the story behind 'The Body Snatchers' has always been one of the most original and best ones, concerning movies dealing with an alien invasion. Its concept provide the movie with plenty of tension and also mystery, especially when you have not seen a 'The Body Snatchers' movie before. This particular movie version does also handle its concept well. It's not as great as the previous two movie version of it but it still has plenty of good moments and originality of its own in it. It's certainly better and way more exciting to watch than the 2007 movie version, starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. I still wished this movie had some of those great actors in it. There are some good actors in this movie but they play secondary characters, such as is the case with R. Lee Ermey and Forest Whitaker. The main parts are being played by some big unknowns, who aren't really charismatic or likable enough. A missed opportunity. A good, different version of the well known story. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Whilst waiting with anticipation for Abel Ferrara's King of New York to arrive in the post,I looked at his film listings on IMDb and I spotted this film,which I have seen being sold at some of the DVD shops near me. The main thing that caught my eye was,for a film that got pushed onto being a straight to video title in the UK by Warners,is,that it is a very well shot film,with an interesting story and a strong cast. The plot: The Malone family move to a military compound so that the husband/dad (Steve Malone) can do test on the soil and water in the area.This is due to some of the people in the area going "crazy" and becoming very paranoid ,and constantly saying that aliens are taking over the human race. Though the family first think that they have moved to a nice area,Their young son starts to think that something very wrong is happening.At his school,he notices that all the other children are painting the exact same picture identically!.Sadly for him,the problems don't stay at school ,when he realises that his mum is acting very strangely,which leads him to start telling the rest of the family that "Mummys dead".At first,they all think that he is being a very nasty kid.However,the older sister starts to think that he maybe telling the truth,when she wakes up to discover some that some extremely disturbing creatures have invaded there house. View on the film; When the credits flashed on the screen,listing the people that wrote the story and the screenplay to the film,I was very pleased to see the very talented Larry Cohen and Stuart Gordon being listed as two of the people that wrote the film.Whilst the stunning 1956 and the 1978 versions of the Body Snatchers,had a strong subtext about Communism (the 56 version)or,a post-Watergate America (the 78 version),this version has a very strong Stephen King/X-Files feel.The first part of the film is spent building the characters up and giving them some depth.The film also does a great job at tapping into a government/military Trust-No- One paranoia.This is done by setting most the film on an army base,that has some very strong overtones of being based on the infamous Area 51. From almost the first few minutes of the film,my reaction to Abel Ferrars direction,was one of complete amazement.Whilst most film makers would have made this film in a rush,and have turned it into a bad B- Movie (espicaly with all the trouble that Warners were giving Ferrara about the film.)Instead,Abel shoots the film in a fantastic way,with some surprisingly impressive camera moves,a very daring ending (an ending,that the legendary director Don Siegel originally wanted for his version of the Body Snatchers,until the studio told him to go for a more "optimistic" ending instead)and by doing a great job at building up the tension,as the last remaining humans try to escape the unstoppable invasion. Final view on the film: A great sci-fi thriller,with a strong story and excellent direction by Abel Ferrara.
