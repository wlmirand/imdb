 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Enzo and Jacques have known each other for a long time. Their friendship started in their childhood days in the Mediterranean. They were not real friends in these days, but there was something they both loved and used to do the whole day long: diving. One day Jacques' father, who was a diver too, died in the Mediterranean sea. After that incident Enzo and Jacques lost contact. After several years, Enzo and Jacques had grown up, Johanna, a young clerk in a security office, has to go to Peru. There she meets Jacques who works for a group of scientists. He dives for some minutes into ice-cold water and the scientists monitor his physical state that is more like a dolphin's than a human's. Johanna can not believe what she sees and gets very interested in Jacques but she's unable to get acquainted with him. Some weeks later, back in her office, she notices a championship for divers that is supposed to take place in Taormina, Italy. In order to see Jacques again she makes up a story so the ...

    Besson did a superb job on "The Big Blue." Directing and writing was spot on and everything gelled perfectly. Very good use of hidden text. Varini captured awesome camera angles with many difficult shots. He and Besson were able to make use of the under-water scenes to give the haunting effect needed for the story line. As for the music, well Bill Conti, can I say any more? It moved the story forward at the right pace. Reno did probably his best acting. Besson and Reno also teamed up in "Leon" bringing out the same lonely character bent upon perfection of his art. Barr, his quiet presence, dominated the emotional scenes and acquired the effect desired upon the audience. Arquette was beautiful and entertaining. She brought the audience to fall in love with Barr at the same time. The ending leaves you wondering and looking for something that so many of us seek, but few of us ever find. I never tire of watching this masterpiece. Bravo! Chris Prochownik

    Is it possible to change, for example, through love, different profession, new circle? When a healthy competition and rivalry becomes a pig-headed and dangerous race with time? Will some people never "grow up"? Those issues/questions are strongly at present in this splendid film by Luc Besson, different from most of his other films. I really enjoyed it in spite of the context uninteresting to me (free-diving). But thanks to subtle dialogs, beautiful landscape, suitable music score and talented cast it is no wonder, that we do here with one of the most successful French films ever. All the actors are premium, but Jean Reno still outperforms all others, including Jean-Marc Barr and Rosanna Arquette. As for the latter, I would have chosen an actress with a more oval face, let's say :). Jean Bouis does a grand small performance as Uncle Louis. Usually I am biased to watch films over 2,5 hours, but this one did not become dull or boring, even the long water-related scenes were appropriate.

    I was 14 years when this movie engulfed a generation and I was left ashore. One year later, I tried to embark but I fainted in front of the theater desk, too much pushed by the crowd of a free movie day. A bit later, the VHS box-set was a gift to my father: all the family watched it on New Year's Day and I didn't get it except for a scene. Years later, I discovered it again and it finally talks to me. I am just totally hooked by this reunion of lost people, unfit to the real world and fascinated by the nature, the beyond and silent world. Besson depicts with great wisdom the best of friendship and the best of love. When Rosanna pushes the button to his final dive, it's the essential act of love: she doesn't like him for herself and she wants him to be happy, she loves him all, with his good and bad sides. Thus, Besson had a good hand by picking this cast: Reno has a heart as big as his height, Barr is so right being shy and dreamy and Rosanna is just incredible as a passionate lover, very fragile compared to those men but as strong as them as well. It's said that Passion is a fire, that it's pleasure and pain at the same time and each of those characters shares it dangerously. In addition, it's the only movie where nature, sea is depicted with such a gripping, compelling call. With such primitive and powerful feelings and setting, it was a challenge to score it well and Serra delivers a miracle. His soundtrack matches beautifully the frames and can be listened apart. The Peruvian tracks are deeply haunting and say it all: it's about being lost and in love... With "Titanic", this movie is just another proof that there is enchantment under the sea and i recommend everyone to dive into this big blue.

    'Le Grand Bleu' is unlike any Luc Besson film I've ever seen and what a movie it is! It's also one of the most difficult movies to define with a few words. For one thing, the trailer is misleading as it gives the interpretation that this is going to be some underwater adventurous horror flick which this movie definitely isn't. It's also one of the hardest movies to categorize because what is it really? A love story? Yes but certainly not the typical boy meets girl kind. The love story here is between a man and a woman who gave up everything for the sake of love, between two friends, between a man and his only family whose picture he carries in his wallet, between man and the sea and it continues. Is it a thriller? It has elements of a thriller but not the kind with jumps and silly twists. The viewer is so engaged and involved in the characters' lives that you simply are left with little choice but to follow them. Is it an adventure movie? Yes, definitely but it's not another James Bond or Indiana Jones, you'll see why. It has a few elements of science fiction. I could go on and on but as my time is limited at the moment, I'll continue with the technical aspects. 'Le Grand Bleu' is a character driven, story driven and atmospheric piece. Besson's direction and writing are exceptionally remarkable.I saw the extended version which is about a good two hours and forty minutes but not for a single moment was I bored. It just flows beautifully. The visuals are mesmerizing (thanks to the superb cinematography, art direction, locations and lighting), the atmosphere is captivating and the score is wonderful. The characters are excellently defined. The title role is stunningly portrayed as being seductive, mysterious, alluring, limitless and above all, free. All the actors do a commendable job. Every actor who is given a speaking part (including the dolphins) does full justice to their character. The three leads, Jean-Marc Barr, Jean Reno and Rosanna Arquette are outstanding. There's passion, romance, adventure, freedom but above all 'Le Grand Bleu' is about love. It has a very laidback and calming feel to it and I would suggest to make yourself comfortable and watch this on a big screen television with great sound system and prepare yourself to experience something cinematically extraordinary.

    This movie has become part of my psyche. With very few words from the protagonists, the film manages to leave the viewer with a philosophy to challenge every day norms of thinking about existence and the meaning and value of life. There are pictorial essays about nature, the environment and man's place in the world. There are subtle hints at the possibility of returning to simpler modes of life style and alternative/counter-culture. There is a very clear theme of respect for others and respect for nature. There is also a wonderfully gentle reminder that not every editorial of the mind is worthy of publishing. Sometimes that which is left unsaid has a greater impact than the spoken word. I truly love this film and I am grateful to its makers for bringing it to life.

    Wow! The reviews really do vary here and I notice that the best reviews seem to start at the beginning of this thread, the worse at the end. This explains a lot, and having watched yesterday what is one of my favourite films, I think I can answer why: for someone watching this film today, you'll find that the acting (particularly Arquette's shocking performance) is over the top and dated. It's a shame that this film has not lasted as well as it could have with a better female lead (however you could say it was down to bad directing). Anyway, that's the bad part. The good part is that this is a special film, in places it's very moving and anyone with a connection to the sea will immediately understand this film, and where the director is taking us. I myself grew up as a child on a Greek Island and spent every day of my childhood diving and fishing - each time I watch this film it takes me back to a special time and place and I can relate to the two main characters. If you're looking for a fast-paced action or comedy then this isn't for you. If you want to shut yourself off from the world, and immerse yourself in an underwater paradise with a touching and humorous storyline then you'll love it. The beginning part of the film is shot on the small Greek Island of Amorgos. It's a stunning Island and if you ever visit you can go to the Monastery built into the mountain, visit the shipwreck and there's also a small bar called 'The Big Blue' which also plays this film EVERY night!

    One of the most haunting and beautifully constructed films I've ever seen. Unique in theme, unusual in story, masterfully photographed, compelling in content - and with a gorgeous, dreamy musical score by Bill Conti in the 'short'-version USA release (owning, and having seen both releases, I much prefer the 'short' one). In my viewing of both versions, the 'long' one stutters and stammers, becomes much too complicated, and misses the poignancy of emotion directly attached to this film - which is the essence of its beauty. A film unlike any you've seen in content, viewers are compelled to attempt to put together the 'theme' from the outset? The first clues come in black and white at the film's beginning as we realize the slight French boy and the burly Italian kid are heart-friends - yet rivals at a distance. The scene is set, and now we can't wait to experience their reunion (and a hint at the plot!) years later, as they meet each other from vastly different venues within the same dangerous sport of free diving. How many of you even realized there was such an extreme sport as 'Competitive Apnea', http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_diving, when you first viewed this film?and more, that it is world-class?? I'll wager the vast majority of you hadn't a clue. And yet I see the many reviews as if it were 'extreme skate-boarding'(!) Here's a shiny Euro in the harbor, buy yourself a life with it - if you can hold your breath that long. This is a glorious movie. See 'both' versions - then, be honest with yourself. Luc Besson is not to be toyed with ~Bob Shank, Tucson, AZ (and, yes, I dive - in the Sea of Cortez, Baja California - 4 hours away)

    At first, the reason why I chose to watch this film was the beautiful movie poster that was portrayed like a commercial advertisement about the sea made by a travel agency. No wonder the poster was nominated as a Best Poster Award at the Cesar Awards France in 1989. Luc Besson is a great director. In this film he didn't disappoint me at all. He became a household name in the same year. This story is based on his childhood dream. Due to his parents who worked as diving instructors, he dreamed of being a dolphin trainer. He grew up near the shore of the Mediterranean. This experience affected the movie a lot and made the unbelievable atmosphere. In the last scene with a dolphin, he put an extraordinary visual element into the movie. And also the soundtrack is one of the wonderful aspects in this movie.The music deserved to get a Cesar Award as a best sound in 1989. Johana (Rosanna Arquette), Jacques (Jean-Mark Barr), Enjo (Jean Reno) are the 3 main characters who conflict emotions with each other and lead the story to the end. The dolphins and the ocean are also the main elements to understand Jacques who is going through mental problem caused by his father's death. He looks lonesome but composed. He needs friends to share his dreams and worries with, but once somebody gets close to him, he runs away from them and goes to the water and dolphins. He doesn't seem to know how to get along with people. On the contrast dolphins look like his sole friends. Jacques and Enjo are childhood friends but also rivals in many ways. If Enjo devotes all his energies to diving so as to access to success and glory, the sea is more than this for Jacques. He was born with it, and the sea will lead him to death. When his rival Enjo dies at the competition, he is in agony and sends him to the sea where he loves. The ocean means all this to Jacques. I'm scared to be in the dark like in the deep dark ocean, but Jacques looks very comfortable and happy with dolphins under the deep dark ocean. The calm and peaceful music makes the scenes under the water astonishing. Music and his move with dolphins make a good combination. Johana is quite logical and sensible as a magazine reporter but she is getting emotional and feels sorry for Jacques. That makes her hard to concentrate on her job about the divers. But she can't help it but falls in love with him. If you're a big fan of Hollywood theatrical releases, you might not love it with no action, no chases, no dangerous cliffhangers, no guns and no explosions. It doesn't even has bad guys. It's more than a love story, or a friendship. You'll be happy when Jacques and Johanna finally love each other, you feel how the ocean is beautiful and peaceful when Jacques dives with the dolphins and you'll cry with Johanna when he doesn't come back. And yes, for him, it's the best of endings, because he doesn't belong here, he really belongs more to the sea than to us. This film is quite different from Hollywood movies, but there are some aspects to attract us to watch more than once. You can think about your life, love and family. It'll help you understand other European movies also.

    One of the best movies ever made. The original soundtrack is outstanding and I wish it was more readily available. Only the Americanized soundtrack is obtainable in USA. Luc is a master at capturing the magical cinematography of the ocean. A tale of the classic doomed love story that more accurately emulates real life unlike the typical Hollywood version.The typical Hollywood love story has nothing to do with reality. Luc captures what's real in his tale of the star crossed lovers unable to actually have a Hollywood happy ending. Rarely does a movie capture the pursuit of a persons passion like this movie manages to do, you have no question about the love of the ocean for the characters he creates.

    Le Grand Bleu of Luc Besson is an unusual film, unique in a sense that it is devoid of any special effect of Hollywood productions. Its cinematography is beautiful but not superior by today's HD standard. The really interesting thing about the film is its depiction of the extraordinary personality of Jacques Mayol, a renowned free diver. Built upon the theme of competition between two diving champions, with a subplot of romance, the film delved into the psycho-physical idiosyncrasy of Jacques Mayol, and painted a portrait of a man who lives in a different universe from the rest of the mankind. Jacques Mayol is not just a free diver. He is a marine animal himself who possesses a physique that could mimic the biological conditions of a dolphin. Since the day he lost his parents, he has chosen a path of life to distance himself from his human folks. Among humans, he appears gauche, naive, almost childish, lack of tact or common sense. He is not interested in competing with another human being. Nor is he interested in falling in love with a woman. He cannot feel the thrill of love or lust or hatred for another human. His awkwardness in socialising with other humans made him an eccentric, introverted and lonely person. As he finds it hard to communicate with humans, he developed an inseparable bond with fish, especially with dolphins. There is an interesting line he said, "When I went down to the bottom of the sea, I couldn't find any good reason of coming back up to the surface." This sums up his philosophical view. By detaching himself from the mundane drudgery of earthly life, avoiding ugly competitiveness, cut-throat jealousy, greed and hatred in human society he reaches a Utopia of his own. In this sense, he is almost non-human. He is a Taoist who lives in harmony with nature, who interacts only with creatures born and bred in nature.

The first clues come in black and white at the film's beginning as we realize the slight French boy and the burly Italian kid are heart-friends - yet rivals at a distance. The scene is set, and now we can't wait to experience their reunion (and a hint at the plot!) years later, as they meet each other from vastly different venues within the same dangerous sport of free diving. How many of you even realized there was such an extreme sport as 'Competitive Apnea', http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_diving, when you first viewed this film?and more, that it is world-class?? I'll wager the vast majority of you hadn't a clue. And yet I see the many reviews as if it were 'extreme skate-boarding'(!) Here's a shiny Euro in the harbor, buy yourself a life with it - if you can hold your breath that long. This is a glorious movie. See 'both' versions - then, be honest with yourself. Luc Besson is not to be toyed with ~Bob Shank, Tucson, AZ (and, yes, I dive - in the Sea of Cortez, Baja California - 4 hours away)

    At first, the reason why I chose to watch this film was the beautiful movie poster that was portrayed like a commercial advertisement about the sea made by a travel agency. No wonder the poster was nominated as a Best Poster Award at the Cesar Awards France in 1989. Luc Besson is a great director. In this film he didn't disappoint me at all. He became a household name in the same year. This story is based on his childhood dream. Due to his parents who worked as diving instructors, he dreamed of being a dolphin trainer. He grew up near the shore of the Mediterranean. This experience affected the movie a lot and made the unbelievable atmosphere. In the last scene with a dolphin, he put an extraordinary visual element into the movie. And also the soundtrack is one of the wonderful aspects in this movie.The music deserved to get a Cesar Award as a best sound in 1989. Johana (Rosanna Arquette), Jacques (Jean-Mark Barr), Enjo (Jean Reno) are the 3 main characters who conflict emotions with each other and lead the story to the end. The dolphins and the ocean are also the main elements to understand Jacques who is going through mental problem caused by his father's death. He looks lonesome but composed. He needs friends to share his dreams and worries with, but once somebody gets close to him, he runs away from them and goes to the water and dolphins. He doesn't seem to know how to get along with people. On the contrast dolphins look like his sole friends. Jacques and Enjo are childhood friends but also rivals in many ways. If Enjo devotes all his energies to diving so as to access to success and glory, the sea is more than this for Jacques. He was born with it, and the sea will lead him to death. When his rival Enjo dies at the competition, he is in agony and sends him to the sea where he loves. The ocean means all this to Jacques. I'm scared to be in the dark like in the deep dark ocean, but Jacques looks very comfortable and happy with dolphins under the deep dark ocean. The calm and peaceful music makes the scenes under the water astonishing. Music and his move with dolphins make a good combination. Johana is quite logical and sensible as a magazine reporter but she is getting emotional and feels sorry for Jacques. That makes her hard to concentrate on her job about the divers. But she can't help it but falls in love with him. If you're a big fan of Hollywood theatrical releases, you might not love it with no action, no chases, no dangerous cliffhangers, no guns and no explosions. It doesn't even has bad guys. It's more than a love story, or a friendship. You'll be happy when Jacques and Johanna finally love each other, you feel how the ocean is beautiful and peaceful when Jacques dives with the dolphins and you'll cry with Johanna when he doesn't come back. And yes, for him, it's the best of endings, because he doesn't belong here, he really belongs more to the sea than to us. This film is quite different from Hollywood movies, but there are some aspects to attract us to watch more than once. You can think about your life, love and family. It'll help you understand other European movies also.

    One of the best movies ever made. The original soundtrack is outstanding and I wish it was more readily available. Only the Americanized soundtrack is obtainable in USA. Luc is a master at capturing the magical cinematography of the ocean. A tale of the classic doomed love story that more accurately emulates real life unlike the typical Hollywood version.The typical Hollywood love story has nothing to do with reality. Luc captures what's real in his tale of the star crossed lovers unable to actually have a Hollywood happy ending. Rarely does a movie capture the pursuit of a persons passion like this movie manages to do, you have no question about the love of the ocean for the characters he creates.

    Le Grand Bleu of Luc Besson is an unusual film, unique in a sense that it is devoid of any special effect of Hollywood productions. Its cinematography is beautiful but not superior by today's HD standard. The really interesting thing about the film is its depiction of the extraordinary personality of Jacques Mayol, a renowned free diver. Built upon the theme of competition between two diving champions, with a subplot of romance, the film delved into the psycho-physical idiosyncrasy of Jacques Mayol, and painted a portrait of a man who lives in a different universe from the rest of the mankind. Jacques Mayol is not just a free diver. He is a marine animal himself who possesses a physique that could mimic the biological conditions of a dolphin. Since the day he lost his parents, he has chosen a path of life to distance himself from his human folks. Among humans, he appears gauche, naive, almost childish, lack of tact or common sense. He is not interested in competing with another human being. Nor is he interested in falling in love with a woman. He cannot feel the thrill of love or lust or hatred for another human. His awkwardness in socialising with other humans made him an eccentric, introverted and lonely person. As he finds it hard to communicate with humans, he developed an inseparable bond with fish, especially with dolphins. There is an interesting line he said, "When I went down to the bottom of the sea, I couldn't find any good reason of coming back up to the surface." This sums up his philosophical view. By detaching himself from the mundane drudgery of earthly life, avoiding ugly competitiveness, cut-throat jealousy, greed and hatred in human society he reaches a Utopia of his own. In this sense, he is almost non-human. He is a Taoist who lives in harmony with nature, who interacts only with creatures born and bred in nature.

    Besson did a superb job on "The Big Blue." Directing and writing was spot on and everything gelled perfectly. Very good use of hidden text. Varini captured awesome camera angles with many difficult shots. He and Besson were able to make use of the under-water scenes to give the haunting effect needed for the story line. As for the music, well Bill Conti, can I say any more? It moved the story forward at the right pace. Reno did probably his best acting. Besson and Reno also teamed up in "Leon" bringing out the same lonely character bent upon perfection of his art. Barr, his quiet presence, dominated the emotional scenes and acquired the effect desired upon the audience. Arquette was beautiful and entertaining. She brought the audience to fall in love with Barr at the same time. The ending leaves you wondering and looking for something that so many of us seek, but few of us ever find. I never tire of watching this masterpiece. Bravo! Chris Prochownik

    Is it possible to change, for example, through love, different profession, new circle? When a healthy competition and rivalry becomes a pig-headed and dangerous race with time? Will some people never "grow up"? Those issues/questions are strongly at present in this splendid film by Luc Besson, different from most of his other films. I really enjoyed it in spite of the context uninteresting to me (free-diving). But thanks to subtle dialogs, beautiful landscape, suitable music score and talented cast it is no wonder, that we do here with one of the most successful French films ever. All the actors are premium, but Jean Reno still outperforms all others, including Jean-Marc Barr and Rosanna Arquette. As for the latter, I would have chosen an actress with a more oval face, let's say :). Jean Bouis does a grand small performance as Uncle Louis. Usually I am biased to watch films over 2,5 hours, but this one did not become dull or boring, even the long water-related scenes were appropriate.

    I was 14 years when this movie engulfed a generation and I was left ashore. One year later, I tried to embark but I fainted in front of the theater desk, too much pushed by the crowd of a free movie day. A bit later, the VHS box-set was a gift to my father: all the family watched it on New Year's Day and I didn't get it except for a scene. Years later, I discovered it again and it finally talks to me. I am just totally hooked by this reunion of lost people, unfit to the real world and fascinated by the nature, the beyond and silent world. Besson depicts with great wisdom the best of friendship and the best of love. When Rosanna pushes the button to his final dive, it's the essential act of love: she doesn't like him for herself and she wants him to be happy, she loves him all, with his good and bad sides. Thus, Besson had a good hand by picking this cast: Reno has a heart as big as his height, Barr is so right being shy and dreamy and Rosanna is just incredible as a passionate lover, very fragile compared to those men but as strong as them as well. It's said that Passion is a fire, that it's pleasure and pain at the same time and each of those characters shares it dangerously. In addition, it's the only movie where nature, sea is depicted with such a gripping, compelling call. With such primitive and powerful feelings and setting, it was a challenge to score it well and Serra delivers a miracle. His soundtrack matches beautifully the frames and can be listened apart. The Peruvian tracks are deeply haunting and say it all: it's about being lost and in love... With "Titanic", this movie is just another proof that there is enchantment under the sea and i recommend everyone to dive into this big blue.

    'Le Grand Bleu' is unlike any Luc Besson film I've ever seen and what a movie it is! It's also one of the most difficult movies to define with a few words. For one thing, the trailer is misleading as it gives the interpretation that this is going to be some underwater adventurous horror flick which this movie definitely isn't. It's also one of the hardest movies to categorize because what is it really? A love story? Yes but certainly not the typical boy meets girl kind. The love story here is between a man and a woman who gave up everything for the sake of love, between two friends, between a man and his only family whose picture he carries in his wallet, between man and the sea and it continues. Is it a thriller? It has elements of a thriller but not the kind with jumps and silly twists. The viewer is so engaged and involved in the characters' lives that you simply are left with little choice but to follow them. Is it an adventure movie? Yes, definitely but it's not another James Bond or Indiana Jones, you'll see why. It has a few elements of science fiction. I could go on and on but as my time is limited at the moment, I'll continue with the technical aspects. 'Le Grand Bleu' is a character driven, story driven and atmospheric piece. Besson's direction and writing are exceptionally remarkable.I saw the extended version which is about a good two hours and forty minutes but not for a single moment was I bored. It just flows beautifully. The visuals are mesmerizing (thanks to the superb cinematography, art direction, locations and lighting), the atmosphere is captivating and the score is wonderful. The characters are excellently defined. The title role is stunningly portrayed as being seductive, mysterious, alluring, limitless and above all, free. All the actors do a commendable job. Every actor who is given a speaking part (including the dolphins) does full justice to their character. The three leads, Jean-Marc Barr, Jean Reno and Rosanna Arquette are outstanding. There's passion, romance, adventure, freedom but above all 'Le Grand Bleu' is about love. It has a very laidback and calming feel to it and I would suggest to make yourself comfortable and watch this on a big screen television with great sound system and prepare yourself to experience something cinematically extraordinary.

    This movie has become part of my psyche. With very few words from the protagonists, the film manages to leave the viewer with a philosophy to challenge every day norms of thinking about existence and the meaning and value of life. There are pictorial essays about nature, the environment and man's place in the world. There are subtle hints at the possibility of returning to simpler modes of life style and alternative/counter-culture. There is a very clear theme of respect for others and respect for nature. There is also a wonderfully gentle reminder that not every editorial of the mind is worthy of publishing. Sometimes that which is left unsaid has a greater impact than the spoken word. I truly love this film and I am grateful to its makers for bringing it to life.

    Wow! The reviews really do vary here and I notice that the best reviews seem to start at the beginning of this thread, the worse at the end. This explains a lot, and having watched yesterday what is one of my favourite films, I think I can answer why: for someone watching this film today, you'll find that the acting (particularly Arquette's shocking performance) is over the top and dated. It's a shame that this film has not lasted as well as it could have with a better female lead (however you could say it was down to bad directing). Anyway, that's the bad part. The good part is that this is a special film, in places it's very moving and anyone with a connection to the sea will immediately understand this film, and where the director is taking us. I myself grew up as a child on a Greek Island and spent every day of my childhood diving and fishing - each time I watch this film it takes me back to a special time and place and I can relate to the two main characters. If you're looking for a fast-paced action or comedy then this isn't for you. If you want to shut yourself off from the world, and immerse yourself in an underwater paradise with a touching and humorous storyline then you'll love it. The beginning part of the film is shot on the small Greek Island of Amorgos. It's a stunning Island and if you ever visit you can go to the Monastery built into the mountain, visit the shipwreck and there's also a small bar called 'The Big Blue' which also plays this film EVERY night!

    One of the most haunting and beautifully constructed films I've ever seen. Unique in theme, unusual in story, masterfully photographed, compelling in content - and with a gorgeous, dreamy musical score by Bill Conti in the 'short'-version USA release (owning, and having seen both releases, I much prefer the 'short' one). In my viewing of both versions, the 'long' one stutters and stammers, becomes much too complicated, and misses the poignancy of emotion directly attached to this film - which is the essence of its beauty. A film unlike any you've seen in content, viewers are compelled to attempt to put together the 'theme' from the outset?

I could go on and on but as my time is limited at the moment, I'll continue with the technical aspects. 'Le Grand Bleu' is a character driven, story driven and atmospheric piece. Besson's direction and writing are exceptionally remarkable.I saw the extended version which is about a good two hours and forty minutes but not for a single moment was I bored. It just flows beautifully. The visuals are mesmerizing (thanks to the superb cinematography, art direction, locations and lighting), the atmosphere is captivating and the score is wonderful. The characters are excellently defined. The title role is stunningly portrayed as being seductive, mysterious, alluring, limitless and above all, free. All the actors do a commendable job. Every actor who is given a speaking part (including the dolphins) does full justice to their character. The three leads, Jean-Marc Barr, Jean Reno and Rosanna Arquette are outstanding. There's passion, romance, adventure, freedom but above all 'Le Grand Bleu' is about love. It has a very laidback and calming feel to it and I would suggest to make yourself comfortable and watch this on a big screen television with great sound system and prepare yourself to experience something cinematically extraordinary.

    This movie has become part of my psyche. With very few words from the protagonists, the film manages to leave the viewer with a philosophy to challenge every day norms of thinking about existence and the meaning and value of life. There are pictorial essays about nature, the environment and man's place in the world. There are subtle hints at the possibility of returning to simpler modes of life style and alternative/counter-culture. There is a very clear theme of respect for others and respect for nature. There is also a wonderfully gentle reminder that not every editorial of the mind is worthy of publishing. Sometimes that which is left unsaid has a greater impact than the spoken word. I truly love this film and I am grateful to its makers for bringing it to life.

    Wow! The reviews really do vary here and I notice that the best reviews seem to start at the beginning of this thread, the worse at the end. This explains a lot, and having watched yesterday what is one of my favourite films, I think I can answer why: for someone watching this film today, you'll find that the acting (particularly Arquette's shocking performance) is over the top and dated. It's a shame that this film has not lasted as well as it could have with a better female lead (however you could say it was down to bad directing). Anyway, that's the bad part. The good part is that this is a special film, in places it's very moving and anyone with a connection to the sea will immediately understand this film, and where the director is taking us. I myself grew up as a child on a Greek Island and spent every day of my childhood diving and fishing - each time I watch this film it takes me back to a special time and place and I can relate to the two main characters. If you're looking for a fast-paced action or comedy then this isn't for you. If you want to shut yourself off from the world, and immerse yourself in an underwater paradise with a touching and humorous storyline then you'll love it. The beginning part of the film is shot on the small Greek Island of Amorgos. It's a stunning Island and if you ever visit you can go to the Monastery built into the mountain, visit the shipwreck and there's also a small bar called 'The Big Blue' which also plays this film EVERY night!

    One of the most haunting and beautifully constructed films I've ever seen. Unique in theme, unusual in story, masterfully photographed, compelling in content - and with a gorgeous, dreamy musical score by Bill Conti in the 'short'-version USA release (owning, and having seen both releases, I much prefer the 'short' one). In my viewing of both versions, the 'long' one stutters and stammers, becomes much too complicated, and misses the poignancy of emotion directly attached to this film - which is the essence of its beauty. A film unlike any you've seen in content, viewers are compelled to attempt to put together the 'theme' from the outset? The first clues come in black and white at the film's beginning as we realize the slight French boy and the burly Italian kid are heart-friends - yet rivals at a distance. The scene is set, and now we can't wait to experience their reunion (and a hint at the plot!) years later, as they meet each other from vastly different venues within the same dangerous sport of free diving. How many of you even realized there was such an extreme sport as 'Competitive Apnea', http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_diving, when you first viewed this film?and more, that it is world-class?? I'll wager the vast majority of you hadn't a clue. And yet I see the many reviews as if it were 'extreme skate-boarding'(!) Here's a shiny Euro in the harbor, buy yourself a life with it - if you can hold your breath that long. This is a glorious movie. See 'both' versions - then, be honest with yourself. Luc Besson is not to be toyed with ~Bob Shank, Tucson, AZ (and, yes, I dive - in the Sea of Cortez, Baja California - 4 hours away)

    At first, the reason why I chose to watch this film was the beautiful movie poster that was portrayed like a commercial advertisement about the sea made by a travel agency. No wonder the poster was nominated as a Best Poster Award at the Cesar Awards France in 1989. Luc Besson is a great director. In this film he didn't disappoint me at all. He became a household name in the same year. This story is based on his childhood dream. Due to his parents who worked as diving instructors, he dreamed of being a dolphin trainer. He grew up near the shore of the Mediterranean. This experience affected the movie a lot and made the unbelievable atmosphere. In the last scene with a dolphin, he put an extraordinary visual element into the movie. And also the soundtrack is one of the wonderful aspects in this movie.The music deserved to get a Cesar Award as a best sound in 1989. Johana (Rosanna Arquette), Jacques (Jean-Mark Barr), Enjo (Jean Reno) are the 3 main characters who conflict emotions with each other and lead the story to the end. The dolphins and the ocean are also the main elements to understand Jacques who is going through mental problem caused by his father's death. He looks lonesome but composed. He needs friends to share his dreams and worries with, but once somebody gets close to him, he runs away from them and goes to the water and dolphins. He doesn't seem to know how to get along with people. On the contrast dolphins look like his sole friends. Jacques and Enjo are childhood friends but also rivals in many ways. If Enjo devotes all his energies to diving so as to access to success and glory, the sea is more than this for Jacques. He was born with it, and the sea will lead him to death. When his rival Enjo dies at the competition, he is in agony and sends him to the sea where he loves. The ocean means all this to Jacques. I'm scared to be in the dark like in the deep dark ocean, but Jacques looks very comfortable and happy with dolphins under the deep dark ocean. The calm and peaceful music makes the scenes under the water astonishing. Music and his move with dolphins make a good combination. Johana is quite logical and sensible as a magazine reporter but she is getting emotional and feels sorry for Jacques. That makes her hard to concentrate on her job about the divers. But she can't help it but falls in love with him. If you're a big fan of Hollywood theatrical releases, you might not love it with no action, no chases, no dangerous cliffhangers, no guns and no explosions. It doesn't even has bad guys. It's more than a love story, or a friendship. You'll be happy when Jacques and Johanna finally love each other, you feel how the ocean is beautiful and peaceful when Jacques dives with the dolphins and you'll cry with Johanna when he doesn't come back. And yes, for him, it's the best of endings, because he doesn't belong here, he really belongs more to the sea than to us. This film is quite different from Hollywood movies, but there are some aspects to attract us to watch more than once. You can think about your life, love and family. It'll help you understand other European movies also.

    One of the best movies ever made. The original soundtrack is outstanding and I wish it was more readily available. Only the Americanized soundtrack is obtainable in USA. Luc is a master at capturing the magical cinematography of the ocean. A tale of the classic doomed love story that more accurately emulates real life unlike the typical Hollywood version.The typical Hollywood love story has nothing to do with reality. Luc captures what's real in his tale of the star crossed lovers unable to actually have a Hollywood happy ending. Rarely does a movie capture the pursuit of a persons passion like this movie manages to do, you have no question about the love of the ocean for the characters he creates.

    Le Grand Bleu of Luc Besson is an unusual film, unique in a sense that it is devoid of any special effect of Hollywood productions. Its cinematography is beautiful but not superior by today's HD standard. The really interesting thing about the film is its depiction of the extraordinary personality of Jacques Mayol, a renowned free diver. Built upon the theme of competition between two diving champions, with a subplot of romance, the film delved into the psycho-physical idiosyncrasy of Jacques Mayol, and painted a portrait of a man who lives in a different universe from the rest of the mankind. Jacques Mayol is not just a free diver. He is a marine animal himself who possesses a physique that could mimic the biological conditions of a dolphin. Since the day he lost his parents, he has chosen a path of life to distance himself from his human folks. Among humans, he appears gauche, naive, almost childish, lack of tact or common sense. He is not interested in competing with another human being. Nor is he interested in falling in love with a woman. He cannot feel the thrill of love or lust or hatred for another human. His awkwardness in socialising with other humans made him an eccentric, introverted and lonely person. As he finds it hard to communicate with humans, he developed an inseparable bond with fish, especially with dolphins. There is an interesting line he said, "When I went down to the bottom of the sea, I couldn't find any good reason of coming back up to the surface." This sums up his philosophical view. By detaching himself from the mundane drudgery of earthly life, avoiding ugly competitiveness, cut-throat jealousy, greed and hatred in human society he reaches a Utopia of his own. In this sense, he is almost non-human. He is a Taoist who lives in harmony with nature, who interacts only with creatures born and bred in nature.

    Besson did a superb job on "The Big Blue." Directing and writing was spot on and everything gelled perfectly. Very good use of hidden text. Varini captured awesome camera angles with many difficult shots. He and Besson were able to make use of the under-water scenes to give the haunting effect needed for the story line. As for the music, well Bill Conti, can I say any more? It moved the story forward at the right pace. Reno did probably his best acting. Besson and Reno also teamed up in "Leon" bringing out the same lonely character bent upon perfection of his art. Barr, his quiet presence, dominated the emotional scenes and acquired the effect desired upon the audience. Arquette was beautiful and entertaining. She brought the audience to fall in love with Barr at the same time. The ending leaves you wondering and looking for something that so many of us seek, but few of us ever find. I never tire of watching this masterpiece. Bravo! Chris Prochownik

    Is it possible to change, for example, through love, different profession, new circle? When a healthy competition and rivalry becomes a pig-headed and dangerous race with time? Will some people never "grow up"? Those issues/questions are strongly at present in this splendid film by Luc Besson, different from most of his other films. I really enjoyed it in spite of the context uninteresting to me (free-diving). But thanks to subtle dialogs, beautiful landscape, suitable music score and talented cast it is no wonder, that we do here with one of the most successful French films ever. All the actors are premium, but Jean Reno still outperforms all others, including Jean-Marc Barr and Rosanna Arquette. As for the latter, I would have chosen an actress with a more oval face, let's say :). Jean Bouis does a grand small performance as Uncle Louis. Usually I am biased to watch films over 2,5 hours, but this one did not become dull or boring, even the long water-related scenes were appropriate.

    I was 14 years when this movie engulfed a generation and I was left ashore. One year later, I tried to embark but I fainted in front of the theater desk, too much pushed by the crowd of a free movie day. A bit later, the VHS box-set was a gift to my father: all the family watched it on New Year's Day and I didn't get it except for a scene. Years later, I discovered it again and it finally talks to me. I am just totally hooked by this reunion of lost people, unfit to the real world and fascinated by the nature, the beyond and silent world. Besson depicts with great wisdom the best of friendship and the best of love. When Rosanna pushes the button to his final dive, it's the essential act of love: she doesn't like him for herself and she wants him to be happy, she loves him all, with his good and bad sides. Thus, Besson had a good hand by picking this cast: Reno has a heart as big as his height, Barr is so right being shy and dreamy and Rosanna is just incredible as a passionate lover, very fragile compared to those men but as strong as them as well. It's said that Passion is a fire, that it's pleasure and pain at the same time and each of those characters shares it dangerously. In addition, it's the only movie where nature, sea is depicted with such a gripping, compelling call. With such primitive and powerful feelings and setting, it was a challenge to score it well and Serra delivers a miracle. His soundtrack matches beautifully the frames and can be listened apart. The Peruvian tracks are deeply haunting and say it all: it's about being lost and in love... With "Titanic", this movie is just another proof that there is enchantment under the sea and i recommend everyone to dive into this big blue.

    'Le Grand Bleu' is unlike any Luc Besson film I've ever seen and what a movie it is! It's also one of the most difficult movies to define with a few words. For one thing, the trailer is misleading as it gives the interpretation that this is going to be some underwater adventurous horror flick which this movie definitely isn't. It's also one of the hardest movies to categorize because what is it really? A love story? Yes but certainly not the typical boy meets girl kind. The love story here is between a man and a woman who gave up everything for the sake of love, between two friends, between a man and his only family whose picture he carries in his wallet, between man and the sea and it continues. Is it a thriller? It has elements of a thriller but not the kind with jumps and silly twists. The viewer is so engaged and involved in the characters' lives that you simply are left with little choice but to follow them. Is it an adventure movie? Yes, definitely but it's not another James Bond or Indiana Jones, you'll see why. It has a few elements of science fiction. I could go on and on but as my time is limited at the moment, I'll continue with the technical aspects. 'Le Grand Bleu' is a character driven, story driven and atmospheric piece.

    Is it possible to change, for example, through love, different profession, new circle? When a healthy competition and rivalry becomes a pig-headed and dangerous race with time? Will some people never "grow up"? Those issues/questions are strongly at present in this splendid film by Luc Besson, different from most of his other films. I really enjoyed it in spite of the context uninteresting to me (free-diving). But thanks to subtle dialogs, beautiful landscape, suitable music score and talented cast it is no wonder, that we do here with one of the most successful French films ever. All the actors are premium, but Jean Reno still outperforms all others, including Jean-Marc Barr and Rosanna Arquette. As for the latter, I would have chosen an actress with a more oval face, let's say :). Jean Bouis does a grand small performance as Uncle Louis. Usually I am biased to watch films over 2,5 hours, but this one did not become dull or boring, even the long water-related scenes were appropriate.

    I was 14 years when this movie engulfed a generation and I was left ashore. One year later, I tried to embark but I fainted in front of the theater desk, too much pushed by the crowd of a free movie day. A bit later, the VHS box-set was a gift to my father: all the family watched it on New Year's Day and I didn't get it except for a scene. Years later, I discovered it again and it finally talks to me. I am just totally hooked by this reunion of lost people, unfit to the real world and fascinated by the nature, the beyond and silent world. Besson depicts with great wisdom the best of friendship and the best of love. When Rosanna pushes the button to his final dive, it's the essential act of love: she doesn't like him for herself and she wants him to be happy, she loves him all, with his good and bad sides. Thus, Besson had a good hand by picking this cast: Reno has a heart as big as his height, Barr is so right being shy and dreamy and Rosanna is just incredible as a passionate lover, very fragile compared to those men but as strong as them as well. It's said that Passion is a fire, that it's pleasure and pain at the same time and each of those characters shares it dangerously. In addition, it's the only movie where nature, sea is depicted with such a gripping, compelling call. With such primitive and powerful feelings and setting, it was a challenge to score it well and Serra delivers a miracle. His soundtrack matches beautifully the frames and can be listened apart. The Peruvian tracks are deeply haunting and say it all: it's about being lost and in love... With "Titanic", this movie is just another proof that there is enchantment under the sea and i recommend everyone to dive into this big blue.

    'Le Grand Bleu' is unlike any Luc Besson film I've ever seen and what a movie it is! It's also one of the most difficult movies to define with a few words. For one thing, the trailer is misleading as it gives the interpretation that this is going to be some underwater adventurous horror flick which this movie definitely isn't. It's also one of the hardest movies to categorize because what is it really? A love story? Yes but certainly not the typical boy meets girl kind. The love story here is between a man and a woman who gave up everything for the sake of love, between two friends, between a man and his only family whose picture he carries in his wallet, between man and the sea and it continues. Is it a thriller? It has elements of a thriller but not the kind with jumps and silly twists. The viewer is so engaged and involved in the characters' lives that you simply are left with little choice but to follow them. Is it an adventure movie? Yes, definitely but it's not another James Bond or Indiana Jones, you'll see why. It has a few elements of science fiction. I could go on and on but as my time is limited at the moment, I'll continue with the technical aspects. 'Le Grand Bleu' is a character driven, story driven and atmospheric piece. Besson's direction and writing are exceptionally remarkable.I saw the extended version which is about a good two hours and forty minutes but not for a single moment was I bored. It just flows beautifully. The visuals are mesmerizing (thanks to the superb cinematography, art direction, locations and lighting), the atmosphere is captivating and the score is wonderful. The characters are excellently defined. The title role is stunningly portrayed as being seductive, mysterious, alluring, limitless and above all, free. All the actors do a commendable job. Every actor who is given a speaking part (including the dolphins) does full justice to their character. The three leads, Jean-Marc Barr, Jean Reno and Rosanna Arquette are outstanding. There's passion, romance, adventure, freedom but above all 'Le Grand Bleu' is about love. It has a very laidback and calming feel to it and I would suggest to make yourself comfortable and watch this on a big screen television with great sound system and prepare yourself to experience something cinematically extraordinary.

    This movie has become part of my psyche. With very few words from the protagonists, the film manages to leave the viewer with a philosophy to challenge every day norms of thinking about existence and the meaning and value of life. There are pictorial essays about nature, the environment and man's place in the world. There are subtle hints at the possibility of returning to simpler modes of life style and alternative/counter-culture. There is a very clear theme of respect for others and respect for nature. There is also a wonderfully gentle reminder that not every editorial of the mind is worthy of publishing. Sometimes that which is left unsaid has a greater impact than the spoken word. I truly love this film and I am grateful to its makers for bringing it to life.

    Wow! The reviews really do vary here and I notice that the best reviews seem to start at the beginning of this thread, the worse at the end. This explains a lot, and having watched yesterday what is one of my favourite films, I think I can answer why: for someone watching this film today, you'll find that the acting (particularly Arquette's shocking performance) is over the top and dated. It's a shame that this film has not lasted as well as it could have with a better female lead (however you could say it was down to bad directing). Anyway, that's the bad part. The good part is that this is a special film, in places it's very moving and anyone with a connection to the sea will immediately understand this film, and where the director is taking us. I myself grew up as a child on a Greek Island and spent every day of my childhood diving and fishing - each time I watch this film it takes me back to a special time and place and I can relate to the two main characters. If you're looking for a fast-paced action or comedy then this isn't for you. If you want to shut yourself off from the world, and immerse yourself in an underwater paradise with a touching and humorous storyline then you'll love it. The beginning part of the film is shot on the small Greek Island of Amorgos. It's a stunning Island and if you ever visit you can go to the Monastery built into the mountain, visit the shipwreck and there's also a small bar called 'The Big Blue' which also plays this film EVERY night!

    One of the most haunting and beautifully constructed films I've ever seen. Unique in theme, unusual in story, masterfully photographed, compelling in content - and with a gorgeous, dreamy musical score by Bill Conti in the 'short'-version USA release (owning, and having seen both releases, I much prefer the 'short' one). In my viewing of both versions, the 'long' one stutters and stammers, becomes much too complicated, and misses the poignancy of emotion directly attached to this film - which is the essence of its beauty. A film unlike any you've seen in content, viewers are compelled to attempt to put together the 'theme' from the outset? The first clues come in black and white at the film's beginning as we realize the slight French boy and the burly Italian kid are heart-friends - yet rivals at a distance. The scene is set, and now we can't wait to experience their reunion (and a hint at the plot!) years later, as they meet each other from vastly different venues within the same dangerous sport of free diving. How many of you even realized there was such an extreme sport as 'Competitive Apnea', http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_diving, when you first viewed this film?and more, that it is world-class?? I'll wager the vast majority of you hadn't a clue. And yet I see the many reviews as if it were 'extreme skate-boarding'(!) Here's a shiny Euro in the harbor, buy yourself a life with it - if you can hold your breath that long. This is a glorious movie. See 'both' versions - then, be honest with yourself. Luc Besson is not to be toyed with ~Bob Shank, Tucson, AZ (and, yes, I dive - in the Sea of Cortez, Baja California - 4 hours away)

    At first, the reason why I chose to watch this film was the beautiful movie poster that was portrayed like a commercial advertisement about the sea made by a travel agency. No wonder the poster was nominated as a Best Poster Award at the Cesar Awards France in 1989. Luc Besson is a great director. In this film he didn't disappoint me at all. He became a household name in the same year. This story is based on his childhood dream. Due to his parents who worked as diving instructors, he dreamed of being a dolphin trainer. He grew up near the shore of the Mediterranean. This experience affected the movie a lot and made the unbelievable atmosphere. In the last scene with a dolphin, he put an extraordinary visual element into the movie. And also the soundtrack is one of the wonderful aspects in this movie.The music deserved to get a Cesar Award as a best sound in 1989. Johana (Rosanna Arquette), Jacques (Jean-Mark Barr), Enjo (Jean Reno) are the 3 main characters who conflict emotions with each other and lead the story to the end. The dolphins and the ocean are also the main elements to understand Jacques who is going through mental problem caused by his father's death. He looks lonesome but composed. He needs friends to share his dreams and worries with, but once somebody gets close to him, he runs away from them and goes to the water and dolphins. He doesn't seem to know how to get along with people. On the contrast dolphins look like his sole friends. Jacques and Enjo are childhood friends but also rivals in many ways. If Enjo devotes all his energies to diving so as to access to success and glory, the sea is more than this for Jacques. He was born with it, and the sea will lead him to death. When his rival Enjo dies at the competition, he is in agony and sends him to the sea where he loves. The ocean means all this to Jacques. I'm scared to be in the dark like in the deep dark ocean, but Jacques looks very comfortable and happy with dolphins under the deep dark ocean. The calm and peaceful music makes the scenes under the water astonishing. Music and his move with dolphins make a good combination. Johana is quite logical and sensible as a magazine reporter but she is getting emotional and feels sorry for Jacques. That makes her hard to concentrate on her job about the divers. But she can't help it but falls in love with him. If you're a big fan of Hollywood theatrical releases, you might not love it with no action, no chases, no dangerous cliffhangers, no guns and no explosions. It doesn't even has bad guys. It's more than a love story, or a friendship. You'll be happy when Jacques and Johanna finally love each other, you feel how the ocean is beautiful and peaceful when Jacques dives with the dolphins and you'll cry with Johanna when he doesn't come back. And yes, for him, it's the best of endings, because he doesn't belong here, he really belongs more to the sea than to us. This film is quite different from Hollywood movies, but there are some aspects to attract us to watch more than once. You can think about your life, love and family. It'll help you understand other European movies also.

    One of the best movies ever made. The original soundtrack is outstanding and I wish it was more readily available. Only the Americanized soundtrack is obtainable in USA. Luc is a master at capturing the magical cinematography of the ocean. A tale of the classic doomed love story that more accurately emulates real life unlike the typical Hollywood version.The typical Hollywood love story has nothing to do with reality. Luc captures what's real in his tale of the star crossed lovers unable to actually have a Hollywood happy ending. Rarely does a movie capture the pursuit of a persons passion like this movie manages to do, you have no question about the love of the ocean for the characters he creates.

    Le Grand Bleu of Luc Besson is an unusual film, unique in a sense that it is devoid of any special effect of Hollywood productions. Its cinematography is beautiful but not superior by today's HD standard. The really interesting thing about the film is its depiction of the extraordinary personality of Jacques Mayol, a renowned free diver. Built upon the theme of competition between two diving champions, with a subplot of romance, the film delved into the psycho-physical idiosyncrasy of Jacques Mayol, and painted a portrait of a man who lives in a different universe from the rest of the mankind. Jacques Mayol is not just a free diver. He is a marine animal himself who possesses a physique that could mimic the biological conditions of a dolphin. Since the day he lost his parents, he has chosen a path of life to distance himself from his human folks. Among humans, he appears gauche, naive, almost childish, lack of tact or common sense. He is not interested in competing with another human being. Nor is he interested in falling in love with a woman. He cannot feel the thrill of love or lust or hatred for another human. His awkwardness in socialising with other humans made him an eccentric, introverted and lonely person. As he finds it hard to communicate with humans, he developed an inseparable bond with fish, especially with dolphins. There is an interesting line he said, "When I went down to the bottom of the sea, I couldn't find any good reason of coming back up to the surface." This sums up his philosophical view. By detaching himself from the mundane drudgery of earthly life, avoiding ugly competitiveness, cut-throat jealousy, greed and hatred in human society he reaches a Utopia of his own. In this sense, he is almost non-human. He is a Taoist who lives in harmony with nature, who interacts only with creatures born and bred in nature.

    Besson did a superb job on "The Big Blue." Directing and writing was spot on and everything gelled perfectly. Very good use of hidden text. Varini captured awesome camera angles with many difficult shots. He and Besson were able to make use of the under-water scenes to give the haunting effect needed for the story line. As for the music, well Bill Conti, can I say any more? It moved the story forward at the right pace. Reno did probably his best acting. Besson and Reno also teamed up in "Leon" bringing out the same lonely character bent upon perfection of his art. Barr, his quiet presence, dominated the emotional scenes and acquired the effect desired upon the audience. Arquette was beautiful and entertaining. She brought the audience to fall in love with Barr at the same time. The ending leaves you wondering and looking for something that so many of us seek, but few of us ever find. I never tire of watching this masterpiece. Bravo! Chris Prochownik

This film is quite different from Hollywood movies, but there are some aspects to attract us to watch more than once. You can think about your life, love and family. It'll help you understand other European movies also.

    One of the best movies ever made. The original soundtrack is outstanding and I wish it was more readily available. Only the Americanized soundtrack is obtainable in USA. Luc is a master at capturing the magical cinematography of the ocean. A tale of the classic doomed love story that more accurately emulates real life unlike the typical Hollywood version.The typical Hollywood love story has nothing to do with reality. Luc captures what's real in his tale of the star crossed lovers unable to actually have a Hollywood happy ending. Rarely does a movie capture the pursuit of a persons passion like this movie manages to do, you have no question about the love of the ocean for the characters he creates.

    Le Grand Bleu of Luc Besson is an unusual film, unique in a sense that it is devoid of any special effect of Hollywood productions. Its cinematography is beautiful but not superior by today's HD standard. The really interesting thing about the film is its depiction of the extraordinary personality of Jacques Mayol, a renowned free diver. Built upon the theme of competition between two diving champions, with a subplot of romance, the film delved into the psycho-physical idiosyncrasy of Jacques Mayol, and painted a portrait of a man who lives in a different universe from the rest of the mankind. Jacques Mayol is not just a free diver. He is a marine animal himself who possesses a physique that could mimic the biological conditions of a dolphin. Since the day he lost his parents, he has chosen a path of life to distance himself from his human folks. Among humans, he appears gauche, naive, almost childish, lack of tact or common sense. He is not interested in competing with another human being. Nor is he interested in falling in love with a woman. He cannot feel the thrill of love or lust or hatred for another human. His awkwardness in socialising with other humans made him an eccentric, introverted and lonely person. As he finds it hard to communicate with humans, he developed an inseparable bond with fish, especially with dolphins. There is an interesting line he said, "When I went down to the bottom of the sea, I couldn't find any good reason of coming back up to the surface." This sums up his philosophical view. By detaching himself from the mundane drudgery of earthly life, avoiding ugly competitiveness, cut-throat jealousy, greed and hatred in human society he reaches a Utopia of his own. In this sense, he is almost non-human. He is a Taoist who lives in harmony with nature, who interacts only with creatures born and bred in nature.

    Besson did a superb job on "The Big Blue." Directing and writing was spot on and everything gelled perfectly. Very good use of hidden text. Varini captured awesome camera angles with many difficult shots. He and Besson were able to make use of the under-water scenes to give the haunting effect needed for the story line. As for the music, well Bill Conti, can I say any more? It moved the story forward at the right pace. Reno did probably his best acting. Besson and Reno also teamed up in "Leon" bringing out the same lonely character bent upon perfection of his art. Barr, his quiet presence, dominated the emotional scenes and acquired the effect desired upon the audience. Arquette was beautiful and entertaining. She brought the audience to fall in love with Barr at the same time. The ending leaves you wondering and looking for something that so many of us seek, but few of us ever find. I never tire of watching this masterpiece. Bravo! Chris Prochownik

    Is it possible to change, for example, through love, different profession, new circle? When a healthy competition and rivalry becomes a pig-headed and dangerous race with time? Will some people never "grow up"? Those issues/questions are strongly at present in this splendid film by Luc Besson, different from most of his other films. I really enjoyed it in spite of the context uninteresting to me (free-diving). But thanks to subtle dialogs, beautiful landscape, suitable music score and talented cast it is no wonder, that we do here with one of the most successful French films ever. All the actors are premium, but Jean Reno still outperforms all others, including Jean-Marc Barr and Rosanna Arquette. As for the latter, I would have chosen an actress with a more oval face, let's say :). Jean Bouis does a grand small performance as Uncle Louis. Usually I am biased to watch films over 2,5 hours, but this one did not become dull or boring, even the long water-related scenes were appropriate.

    I was 14 years when this movie engulfed a generation and I was left ashore. One year later, I tried to embark but I fainted in front of the theater desk, too much pushed by the crowd of a free movie day. A bit later, the VHS box-set was a gift to my father: all the family watched it on New Year's Day and I didn't get it except for a scene. Years later, I discovered it again and it finally talks to me. I am just totally hooked by this reunion of lost people, unfit to the real world and fascinated by the nature, the beyond and silent world. Besson depicts with great wisdom the best of friendship and the best of love. When Rosanna pushes the button to his final dive, it's the essential act of love: she doesn't like him for herself and she wants him to be happy, she loves him all, with his good and bad sides. Thus, Besson had a good hand by picking this cast: Reno has a heart as big as his height, Barr is so right being shy and dreamy and Rosanna is just incredible as a passionate lover, very fragile compared to those men but as strong as them as well. It's said that Passion is a fire, that it's pleasure and pain at the same time and each of those characters shares it dangerously. In addition, it's the only movie where nature, sea is depicted with such a gripping, compelling call. With such primitive and powerful feelings and setting, it was a challenge to score it well and Serra delivers a miracle. His soundtrack matches beautifully the frames and can be listened apart. The Peruvian tracks are deeply haunting and say it all: it's about being lost and in love... With "Titanic", this movie is just another proof that there is enchantment under the sea and i recommend everyone to dive into this big blue.

    'Le Grand Bleu' is unlike any Luc Besson film I've ever seen and what a movie it is! It's also one of the most difficult movies to define with a few words. For one thing, the trailer is misleading as it gives the interpretation that this is going to be some underwater adventurous horror flick which this movie definitely isn't. It's also one of the hardest movies to categorize because what is it really? A love story? Yes but certainly not the typical boy meets girl kind. The love story here is between a man and a woman who gave up everything for the sake of love, between two friends, between a man and his only family whose picture he carries in his wallet, between man and the sea and it continues. Is it a thriller? It has elements of a thriller but not the kind with jumps and silly twists. The viewer is so engaged and involved in the characters' lives that you simply are left with little choice but to follow them. Is it an adventure movie? Yes, definitely but it's not another James Bond or Indiana Jones, you'll see why. It has a few elements of science fiction. I could go on and on but as my time is limited at the moment, I'll continue with the technical aspects. 'Le Grand Bleu' is a character driven, story driven and atmospheric piece. Besson's direction and writing are exceptionally remarkable.I saw the extended version which is about a good two hours and forty minutes but not for a single moment was I bored. It just flows beautifully. The visuals are mesmerizing (thanks to the superb cinematography, art direction, locations and lighting), the atmosphere is captivating and the score is wonderful. The characters are excellently defined. The title role is stunningly portrayed as being seductive, mysterious, alluring, limitless and above all, free. All the actors do a commendable job. Every actor who is given a speaking part (including the dolphins) does full justice to their character. The three leads, Jean-Marc Barr, Jean Reno and Rosanna Arquette are outstanding. There's passion, romance, adventure, freedom but above all 'Le Grand Bleu' is about love. It has a very laidback and calming feel to it and I would suggest to make yourself comfortable and watch this on a big screen television with great sound system and prepare yourself to experience something cinematically extraordinary.

    This movie has become part of my psyche. With very few words from the protagonists, the film manages to leave the viewer with a philosophy to challenge every day norms of thinking about existence and the meaning and value of life. There are pictorial essays about nature, the environment and man's place in the world. There are subtle hints at the possibility of returning to simpler modes of life style and alternative/counter-culture. There is a very clear theme of respect for others and respect for nature. There is also a wonderfully gentle reminder that not every editorial of the mind is worthy of publishing. Sometimes that which is left unsaid has a greater impact than the spoken word. I truly love this film and I am grateful to its makers for bringing it to life.

    Wow! The reviews really do vary here and I notice that the best reviews seem to start at the beginning of this thread, the worse at the end. This explains a lot, and having watched yesterday what is one of my favourite films, I think I can answer why: for someone watching this film today, you'll find that the acting (particularly Arquette's shocking performance) is over the top and dated. It's a shame that this film has not lasted as well as it could have with a better female lead (however you could say it was down to bad directing). Anyway, that's the bad part. The good part is that this is a special film, in places it's very moving and anyone with a connection to the sea will immediately understand this film, and where the director is taking us. I myself grew up as a child on a Greek Island and spent every day of my childhood diving and fishing - each time I watch this film it takes me back to a special time and place and I can relate to the two main characters. If you're looking for a fast-paced action or comedy then this isn't for you. If you want to shut yourself off from the world, and immerse yourself in an underwater paradise with a touching and humorous storyline then you'll love it. The beginning part of the film is shot on the small Greek Island of Amorgos. It's a stunning Island and if you ever visit you can go to the Monastery built into the mountain, visit the shipwreck and there's also a small bar called 'The Big Blue' which also plays this film EVERY night!

    One of the most haunting and beautifully constructed films I've ever seen. Unique in theme, unusual in story, masterfully photographed, compelling in content - and with a gorgeous, dreamy musical score by Bill Conti in the 'short'-version USA release (owning, and having seen both releases, I much prefer the 'short' one). In my viewing of both versions, the 'long' one stutters and stammers, becomes much too complicated, and misses the poignancy of emotion directly attached to this film - which is the essence of its beauty. A film unlike any you've seen in content, viewers are compelled to attempt to put together the 'theme' from the outset? The first clues come in black and white at the film's beginning as we realize the slight French boy and the burly Italian kid are heart-friends - yet rivals at a distance. The scene is set, and now we can't wait to experience their reunion (and a hint at the plot!) years later, as they meet each other from vastly different venues within the same dangerous sport of free diving. How many of you even realized there was such an extreme sport as 'Competitive Apnea', http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_diving, when you first viewed this film?and more, that it is world-class?? I'll wager the vast majority of you hadn't a clue. And yet I see the many reviews as if it were 'extreme skate-boarding'(!) Here's a shiny Euro in the harbor, buy yourself a life with it - if you can hold your breath that long. This is a glorious movie. See 'both' versions - then, be honest with yourself. Luc Besson is not to be toyed with ~Bob Shank, Tucson, AZ (and, yes, I dive - in the Sea of Cortez, Baja California - 4 hours away)

    At first, the reason why I chose to watch this film was the beautiful movie poster that was portrayed like a commercial advertisement about the sea made by a travel agency. No wonder the poster was nominated as a Best Poster Award at the Cesar Awards France in 1989. Luc Besson is a great director. In this film he didn't disappoint me at all. He became a household name in the same year. This story is based on his childhood dream. Due to his parents who worked as diving instructors, he dreamed of being a dolphin trainer. He grew up near the shore of the Mediterranean. This experience affected the movie a lot and made the unbelievable atmosphere. In the last scene with a dolphin, he put an extraordinary visual element into the movie. And also the soundtrack is one of the wonderful aspects in this movie.The music deserved to get a Cesar Award as a best sound in 1989. Johana (Rosanna Arquette), Jacques (Jean-Mark Barr), Enjo (Jean Reno) are the 3 main characters who conflict emotions with each other and lead the story to the end. The dolphins and the ocean are also the main elements to understand Jacques who is going through mental problem caused by his father's death. He looks lonesome but composed. He needs friends to share his dreams and worries with, but once somebody gets close to him, he runs away from them and goes to the water and dolphins. He doesn't seem to know how to get along with people. On the contrast dolphins look like his sole friends. Jacques and Enjo are childhood friends but also rivals in many ways. If Enjo devotes all his energies to diving so as to access to success and glory, the sea is more than this for Jacques. He was born with it, and the sea will lead him to death. When his rival Enjo dies at the competition, he is in agony and sends him to the sea where he loves. The ocean means all this to Jacques. I'm scared to be in the dark like in the deep dark ocean, but Jacques looks very comfortable and happy with dolphins under the deep dark ocean. The calm and peaceful music makes the scenes under the water astonishing. Music and his move with dolphins make a good combination. Johana is quite logical and sensible as a magazine reporter but she is getting emotional and feels sorry for Jacques. That makes her hard to concentrate on her job about the divers. But she can't help it but falls in love with him. If you're a big fan of Hollywood theatrical releases, you might not love it with no action, no chases, no dangerous cliffhangers, no guns and no explosions. It doesn't even has bad guys. It's more than a love story, or a friendship. You'll be happy when Jacques and Johanna finally love each other, you feel how the ocean is beautiful and peaceful when Jacques dives with the dolphins and you'll cry with Johanna when he doesn't come back. And yes, for him, it's the best of endings, because he doesn't belong here, he really belongs more to the sea than to us. This film is quite different from Hollywood movies, but there are some aspects to attract us to watch more than once. You can think about your life, love and family. It'll help you understand other European movies also.

    One of the most haunting and beautifully constructed films I've ever seen. Unique in theme, unusual in story, masterfully photographed, compelling in content - and with a gorgeous, dreamy musical score by Bill Conti in the 'short'-version USA release (owning, and having seen both releases, I much prefer the 'short' one). In my viewing of both versions, the 'long' one stutters and stammers, becomes much too complicated, and misses the poignancy of emotion directly attached to this film - which is the essence of its beauty. A film unlike any you've seen in content, viewers are compelled to attempt to put together the 'theme' from the outset? The first clues come in black and white at the film's beginning as we realize the slight French boy and the burly Italian kid are heart-friends - yet rivals at a distance. The scene is set, and now we can't wait to experience their reunion (and a hint at the plot!) years later, as they meet each other from vastly different venues within the same dangerous sport of free diving. How many of you even realized there was such an extreme sport as 'Competitive Apnea', http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_diving, when you first viewed this film?and more, that it is world-class?? I'll wager the vast majority of you hadn't a clue. And yet I see the many reviews as if it were 'extreme skate-boarding'(!) Here's a shiny Euro in the harbor, buy yourself a life with it - if you can hold your breath that long. This is a glorious movie. See 'both' versions - then, be honest with yourself. Luc Besson is not to be toyed with ~Bob Shank, Tucson, AZ (and, yes, I dive - in the Sea of Cortez, Baja California - 4 hours away)

    At first, the reason why I chose to watch this film was the beautiful movie poster that was portrayed like a commercial advertisement about the sea made by a travel agency. No wonder the poster was nominated as a Best Poster Award at the Cesar Awards France in 1989. Luc Besson is a great director. In this film he didn't disappoint me at all. He became a household name in the same year. This story is based on his childhood dream. Due to his parents who worked as diving instructors, he dreamed of being a dolphin trainer. He grew up near the shore of the Mediterranean. This experience affected the movie a lot and made the unbelievable atmosphere. In the last scene with a dolphin, he put an extraordinary visual element into the movie. And also the soundtrack is one of the wonderful aspects in this movie.The music deserved to get a Cesar Award as a best sound in 1989. Johana (Rosanna Arquette), Jacques (Jean-Mark Barr), Enjo (Jean Reno) are the 3 main characters who conflict emotions with each other and lead the story to the end. The dolphins and the ocean are also the main elements to understand Jacques who is going through mental problem caused by his father's death. He looks lonesome but composed. He needs friends to share his dreams and worries with, but once somebody gets close to him, he runs away from them and goes to the water and dolphins. He doesn't seem to know how to get along with people. On the contrast dolphins look like his sole friends. Jacques and Enjo are childhood friends but also rivals in many ways. If Enjo devotes all his energies to diving so as to access to success and glory, the sea is more than this for Jacques. He was born with it, and the sea will lead him to death. When his rival Enjo dies at the competition, he is in agony and sends him to the sea where he loves. The ocean means all this to Jacques. I'm scared to be in the dark like in the deep dark ocean, but Jacques looks very comfortable and happy with dolphins under the deep dark ocean. The calm and peaceful music makes the scenes under the water astonishing. Music and his move with dolphins make a good combination. Johana is quite logical and sensible as a magazine reporter but she is getting emotional and feels sorry for Jacques. That makes her hard to concentrate on her job about the divers. But she can't help it but falls in love with him. If you're a big fan of Hollywood theatrical releases, you might not love it with no action, no chases, no dangerous cliffhangers, no guns and no explosions. It doesn't even has bad guys. It's more than a love story, or a friendship. You'll be happy when Jacques and Johanna finally love each other, you feel how the ocean is beautiful and peaceful when Jacques dives with the dolphins and you'll cry with Johanna when he doesn't come back. And yes, for him, it's the best of endings, because he doesn't belong here, he really belongs more to the sea than to us. This film is quite different from Hollywood movies, but there are some aspects to attract us to watch more than once. You can think about your life, love and family. It'll help you understand other European movies also.

    One of the best movies ever made. The original soundtrack is outstanding and I wish it was more readily available. Only the Americanized soundtrack is obtainable in USA. Luc is a master at capturing the magical cinematography of the ocean. A tale of the classic doomed love story that more accurately emulates real life unlike the typical Hollywood version.The typical Hollywood love story has nothing to do with reality. Luc captures what's real in his tale of the star crossed lovers unable to actually have a Hollywood happy ending. Rarely does a movie capture the pursuit of a persons passion like this movie manages to do, you have no question about the love of the ocean for the characters he creates.

    Le Grand Bleu of Luc Besson is an unusual film, unique in a sense that it is devoid of any special effect of Hollywood productions. Its cinematography is beautiful but not superior by today's HD standard. The really interesting thing about the film is its depiction of the extraordinary personality of Jacques Mayol, a renowned free diver. Built upon the theme of competition between two diving champions, with a subplot of romance, the film delved into the psycho-physical idiosyncrasy of Jacques Mayol, and painted a portrait of a man who lives in a different universe from the rest of the mankind. Jacques Mayol is not just a free diver. He is a marine animal himself who possesses a physique that could mimic the biological conditions of a dolphin. Since the day he lost his parents, he has chosen a path of life to distance himself from his human folks. Among humans, he appears gauche, naive, almost childish, lack of tact or common sense. He is not interested in competing with another human being. Nor is he interested in falling in love with a woman. He cannot feel the thrill of love or lust or hatred for another human. His awkwardness in socialising with other humans made him an eccentric, introverted and lonely person. As he finds it hard to communicate with humans, he developed an inseparable bond with fish, especially with dolphins. There is an interesting line he said, "When I went down to the bottom of the sea, I couldn't find any good reason of coming back up to the surface." This sums up his philosophical view. By detaching himself from the mundane drudgery of earthly life, avoiding ugly competitiveness, cut-throat jealousy, greed and hatred in human society he reaches a Utopia of his own. In this sense, he is almost non-human. He is a Taoist who lives in harmony with nature, who interacts only with creatures born and bred in nature.

    Besson did a superb job on "The Big Blue." Directing and writing was spot on and everything gelled perfectly. Very good use of hidden text. Varini captured awesome camera angles with many difficult shots. He and Besson were able to make use of the under-water scenes to give the haunting effect needed for the story line. As for the music, well Bill Conti, can I say any more? It moved the story forward at the right pace. Reno did probably his best acting. Besson and Reno also teamed up in "Leon" bringing out the same lonely character bent upon perfection of his art. Barr, his quiet presence, dominated the emotional scenes and acquired the effect desired upon the audience. Arquette was beautiful and entertaining. She brought the audience to fall in love with Barr at the same time. The ending leaves you wondering and looking for something that so many of us seek, but few of us ever find. I never tire of watching this masterpiece. Bravo! Chris Prochownik

    Is it possible to change, for example, through love, different profession, new circle? When a healthy competition and rivalry becomes a pig-headed and dangerous race with time? Will some people never "grow up"? Those issues/questions are strongly at present in this splendid film by Luc Besson, different from most of his other films. I really enjoyed it in spite of the context uninteresting to me (free-diving). But thanks to subtle dialogs, beautiful landscape, suitable music score and talented cast it is no wonder, that we do here with one of the most successful French films ever. All the actors are premium, but Jean Reno still outperforms all others, including Jean-Marc Barr and Rosanna Arquette. As for the latter, I would have chosen an actress with a more oval face, let's say :). Jean Bouis does a grand small performance as Uncle Louis. Usually I am biased to watch films over 2,5 hours, but this one did not become dull or boring, even the long water-related scenes were appropriate.

    I was 14 years when this movie engulfed a generation and I was left ashore. One year later, I tried to embark but I fainted in front of the theater desk, too much pushed by the crowd of a free movie day. A bit later, the VHS box-set was a gift to my father: all the family watched it on New Year's Day and I didn't get it except for a scene. Years later, I discovered it again and it finally talks to me. I am just totally hooked by this reunion of lost people, unfit to the real world and fascinated by the nature, the beyond and silent world. Besson depicts with great wisdom the best of friendship and the best of love. When Rosanna pushes the button to his final dive, it's the essential act of love: she doesn't like him for herself and she wants him to be happy, she loves him all, with his good and bad sides. Thus, Besson had a good hand by picking this cast: Reno has a heart as big as his height, Barr is so right being shy and dreamy and Rosanna is just incredible as a passionate lover, very fragile compared to those men but as strong as them as well. It's said that Passion is a fire, that it's pleasure and pain at the same time and each of those characters shares it dangerously. In addition, it's the only movie where nature, sea is depicted with such a gripping, compelling call. With such primitive and powerful feelings and setting, it was a challenge to score it well and Serra delivers a miracle. His soundtrack matches beautifully the frames and can be listened apart. The Peruvian tracks are deeply haunting and say it all: it's about being lost and in love... With "Titanic", this movie is just another proof that there is enchantment under the sea and i recommend everyone to dive into this big blue.

    'Le Grand Bleu' is unlike any Luc Besson film I've ever seen and what a movie it is! It's also one of the most difficult movies to define with a few words. For one thing, the trailer is misleading as it gives the interpretation that this is going to be some underwater adventurous horror flick which this movie definitely isn't. It's also one of the hardest movies to categorize because what is it really? A love story? Yes but certainly not the typical boy meets girl kind. The love story here is between a man and a woman who gave up everything for the sake of love, between two friends, between a man and his only family whose picture he carries in his wallet, between man and the sea and it continues. Is it a thriller? It has elements of a thriller but not the kind with jumps and silly twists. The viewer is so engaged and involved in the characters' lives that you simply are left with little choice but to follow them. Is it an adventure movie? Yes, definitely but it's not another James Bond or Indiana Jones, you'll see why. It has a few elements of science fiction. I could go on and on but as my time is limited at the moment, I'll continue with the technical aspects. 'Le Grand Bleu' is a character driven, story driven and atmospheric piece. Besson's direction and writing are exceptionally remarkable.I saw the extended version which is about a good two hours and forty minutes but not for a single moment was I bored. It just flows beautifully. The visuals are mesmerizing (thanks to the superb cinematography, art direction, locations and lighting), the atmosphere is captivating and the score is wonderful. The characters are excellently defined. The title role is stunningly portrayed as being seductive, mysterious, alluring, limitless and above all, free. All the actors do a commendable job. Every actor who is given a speaking part (including the dolphins) does full justice to their character. The three leads, Jean-Marc Barr, Jean Reno and Rosanna Arquette are outstanding. There's passion, romance, adventure, freedom but above all 'Le Grand Bleu' is about love. It has a very laidback and calming feel to it and I would suggest to make yourself comfortable and watch this on a big screen television with great sound system and prepare yourself to experience something cinematically extraordinary.

    This movie has become part of my psyche. With very few words from the protagonists, the film manages to leave the viewer with a philosophy to challenge every day norms of thinking about existence and the meaning and value of life. There are pictorial essays about nature, the environment and man's place in the world. There are subtle hints at the possibility of returning to simpler modes of life style and alternative/counter-culture. There is a very clear theme of respect for others and respect for nature. There is also a wonderfully gentle reminder that not every editorial of the mind is worthy of publishing. Sometimes that which is left unsaid has a greater impact than the spoken word. I truly love this film and I am grateful to its makers for bringing it to life.

    Wow! The reviews really do vary here and I notice that the best reviews seem to start at the beginning of this thread, the worse at the end. This explains a lot, and having watched yesterday what is one of my favourite films, I think I can answer why: for someone watching this film today, you'll find that the acting (particularly Arquette's shocking performance) is over the top and dated. It's a shame that this film has not lasted as well as it could have with a better female lead (however you could say it was down to bad directing). Anyway, that's the bad part. The good part is that this is a special film, in places it's very moving and anyone with a connection to the sea will immediately understand this film, and where the director is taking us. I myself grew up as a child on a Greek Island and spent every day of my childhood diving and fishing - each time I watch this film it takes me back to a special time and place and I can relate to the two main characters. If you're looking for a fast-paced action or comedy then this isn't for you. If you want to shut yourself off from the world, and immerse yourself in an underwater paradise with a touching and humorous storyline then you'll love it. The beginning part of the film is shot on the small Greek Island of Amorgos. It's a stunning Island and if you ever visit you can go to the Monastery built into the mountain, visit the shipwreck and there's also a small bar called 'The Big Blue' which also plays this film EVERY night!
