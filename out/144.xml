    What a movie.. what a ride.. I caught it on cable tonight for the umpteenth time and was still shaking my head in wonder and amazement at the creation that this movie is. Twenty five years later, Die Hard still entertains. Everything is just fabulous. John McTiernan.. sir, you have our utmost gratitude for this outstanding piece of cinema. Having watched it close to a hundred times now, and the admiration just keeps on increasing for the utter perfection of it all. Not a moment is out of place.. not a single line delivered by someone who is not deeply involved with their character and the situation s/he finds themselves in.. not a single instance of narration that grates or is cheesy or corny or inappropriate.. The action looks real.. the fights are brilliant.. the plot has negligible loopholes.. and absolutely everyone's performance is unbelievably good for an action movie.. I could go on and on about how well the key scenes are executed and how accomplished the entire production is, but I promised myself that this one would be without spoilers. Which is why I also can't reveal why I have knocked off that last star. Probably pedantic anyway. A last word for Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. Can we have them together in another movie please? Any movie. Any absolutely any movie. Please!

    I must admit that although Die Hard isn't my 'favourite' action film as such, it is still an excellent action film and is right up there with the best films of its genre. We begin with officer John McClane (Willis) who is on a flight from New York to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his family. His ex wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) is at a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza and John has arranged to meet her there. Whilst there, the complex is breached by a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). Hans is intent on stealing a $600 million dollar fortune which is kept in a safe at the Plaza. When the owner of the Nakatomi Plaza Joseph Yoshinobu (James Shigeta)refuses to provide Hans with the code for the safe, Hans kills him and due to the fact that no-one else knows the code he sets about trying a different method to get his hands on the cash. In the meantime, he also holds all the patrons hostage - all except one person who managed to evade capture namely 'John McClane' and he is determined to stop Hans and his goons by any means possible. A lot of the strengths in Die Hard come from the way the tension is created. Although all of this takes place in a 40 storey building, strangely enough at times there is almost a feeling of 'claustrophobia'. You see a lot of McClane in tight spaces and on a number of occasions he gets very close to his captors and I think it really helps to create an edge of your seat feel to the whole proceedings. Hans Gruber is also an excellent villain - the very fact that he is so calm, cool and calculated makes him more dangerous and ultimately more terrifying. It seems that no matter what is thrown at him, he never panics and almost views holding hostages as being like a game of chess - he always appears to be one or 2 moves ahead of everyone else. Kudos also should go to John McTiernan for his exceptional direction of Die Hard. He really has given it a 'claustrophobic' feel - much like he did with Predator. I also felt the score was excellent - although it wasn't as good as the score in Predator it still more than complemented the overall tone of the film. As with Predator, there are also plenty of humorous moments and one liners (who can forget the classic 'Yippee Ki Yay' line from McClane). The acting was also great by everyone involved (particularly by Alan Rickman). His portrayal of Hans Gruber was pretty much perfect and he will be long remembered as being one of the better villains to grace our screens. Even though Die Hard is now 25 years old, it still has a certain 'freshness' about it and it is a film that I thoroughly enjoyed.

    If someone were to force me to tell him/her my favorite movie of all time, I would most likely say Die Hard. In my opinion, this is as close to a perfect action movie you can get. Perfect characters, perfect one liners, perfect plot, perfect villain, etc. This simple yet genius movie revolutionized the idea of a lone man trapped in the wrong place at the wrong time with NYPD officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) trapped in the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles after terrorists lead by Hans Grubber (Alan Rickman) invade the building, with John only relying on all of his police training and his wits to survive this Christmas Eve from Hell. 10/10

    Review #2 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews In 1988, when Die Hard came out, my parents and a family friend went to see it in New York City in a big theater. The movie was so crowded, they all did not even get to sit together. (And I don't even think it was opening weekend!) Take that into consideration for how big a movie this was back then and still is. Die Hard is the best action movie, and probably my favorite movie, with a close second or tie with The Shawshank Redemption. Die Hard combines well-executed action scenes with cheesy but iconic one-liners and a great main character. As sarcastic, profane, and messed up John McClane is, you have to find yourself rooting for him. Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, and Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, and many others will have their acting skills defined by this movie forever. After all, it definitely gave a career boost to some, although Willis already had a nice acting resume on his plate. Nevertheless, it redefined the whole genre. Action movies consist of a bunch of key elements that come together to form a coherent picture. (At least I hope it will be coherent, as some tend to fail at this process.) They combine action scenes (obviously), at least a couple one-liners, a car (there's always a car or some kind of vehicle), a villain, and usually an explosion or two. Or three. ;-) All of these elements and many more were all in Die Hard, and it kind of changed the genre for good. You will hear people say "Oh, that movie is a Die Hard rip-off", or "That stunt was first made famous in Die Hard." It's not that action movies didn't have these elements before Die Hard, it's just that Die Hard made them better and/or famous. Die Hard will keep you on the edge of your seat, and is an extremely well-done picture that doesn't lag or slow down at all. It eases into the action in such a way that it feels natural and not forced or unnecessary. HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    John McTiernan's second mainstream film manages to amazingly top an outstanding previous effort, Predator. This even better film will resonate will audiences even more than Predator. While Predator was a superbly crafted and fairly straightforward sci-fi action thriller, this film takes the archetypal imperfect everyman loner, saddled with personal issues(in the form as an estranged relationship with is corporate high flying wife) and through a twist of fate has him battling, against the odds an international team of highly motivated and competent) bank robbers while trying to protect his wife, who is amongst the hostages these robbers have taken. It differed from both Predator and other action-thriller films of the period in that the hero was more human in physique, rather than the physical super-men such as Stallone, Norris and Schwarzenegger. He survives through determination and his wits rather than on brute strength, and Bruce Willis was a refreshingly original casting choice. The plot is cleverly structured and sets up all the characters seamlessly. There are good performances from most of the key players. The robbers are all interesting, but clearly most time is spent with Clarence Gilyard Jr. and the late Alexander Gudunov, who are both charismatic, albeit it is their boss, the relatively unknown at the time British actor Alan Rickman, who steals the show and is terrific in this film, and makes for a worthy rival and antagonist for Bruce Willis's John McClane. Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson are also good value, as is James Shigeta as Mr Takagi. However a couple of the characters do stray into caricatures, notably De'Voreaux White and Hart Bochner as Argyle and Ellis respectively. Fortunately the other performances and the film itself as so fast paced and involving you can overlook these slightly over the top performances, and they do not detract from the enjoyment of the picture. The good performances are woven into an expertly crafted film. Technical credits are outstanding. Jan De Bont's photography is stylish, and makes fantastic use of the Fox Plaza Tower to double for the Nakatomi building. He also makes clever use, but not over use of lens flares to create an excellent mood and atmosphere. Frank J Urioste's stunning editing, Michael Kamen's great music and Richard Edlund's brilliant but incredibly subtle visual effects all work together with truly fantastic action sequences and stuntwork, and director John McTiernan deserves huge credit. He draws out entertaining performances from most of the cast, but mixes this brilliantly clever setting up of the characters, and then orchestrating some truly outstanding action sequences with a pervading atmosphere of growing tension and suspense. It has stood the test of time brilliantly, it still by some way the best of the series, and overall comes off as a truly outstanding and emotionally satisfying thriller. Overall a terrific achievement that has not been bettered.

    This is one of the very best films I've ever seen at the cinema and its greatness shines through on (a decent) TV. The plot is fabulously layered yet crisp, the characters are very strong (Rickman's Hans sets the standard), the story has many wonderful character moments yet gets on with it when it needs to...wonderful stuff. In particular, Bruce's hero is brilliantly reluctant, always trying to sit out the storm rather than lead it along. This was so refreshing after years of the cheerfully bullet-spraying outings of Messrs Stallone and Schwarzenegger. There's plenty of military hardware and plenty of knuckle-biting moments. Really is one to savour as it sweeps you along.

    If you know that famous quote then you know what film I am talking about. Yes I know I didn't use that Yippie-Kay-ya line because its already been used too many times in other reviews. But anyway onto the film, We are talking about that amazing John Mctiernan movie Die Hard. Die Hard is basically about terrorists take over Yakitomi plaza and John McClain has to stop them. Now that sounds simple right? Well looks can be deceiving as there are many twists and turns and it all takes place in this plaza and in a few other places as well. Bruce Willis as John McClain is such a bad-ass in this movie and is easily one of the best action characters ever written. He's funny, vulgar, and overall a real character that you care for. But how can I forget one of the best villains ever in movie history: Hans Gruber. Alan Rickman plays this absolutely entertaining as hell villain and he is very different from other villains as he is very unpredictable and changes his plans when things go wrong and being calm and collect about it. His plans are absolutely deviously clever in this film. I wont go into much detail as it will spoil the movie. Alan Rickman is just so entertaining when hes on screen. Also, the secondary characters were great as well in their roles. Not to mention the cinematography is fantastic and John Mctiernan gets some awesome shots and crazy camera angles that make the film more tension-built and suspenseful but entertaining as well. Overall, this is one of the best action movies ever made by far because of the tension and entertainment value than any other action film. *In Alan Rickman voice* Now go see this movie! Now, now, now!!!

    My statement of Bad-Ass is a small compliment to this awesome action packed film. It is a film that I can safely say will go down in history as one of the greatest action movies of all time. Nearly every action sequence is close to perfection and the storyline is fantastic, I wish could tell you more of the storyline but I do not want to spoil the movie for anyone else. Also the acting by Bruce Willis and Alan Rick man is superb, making the characters come to life. Comparing this to its sequel this movie is a lot more out of line and Bad-Ass. Even if the first Die Hard was the best, the other films in the franchise are also amazingly awesome in a lot of ways. I am glad to have blessed my life with this film and wish for others to do so for their enjoyment and benefit. Yippee-Kai-Yay

    This is like so clich&eacute;d! Mission impossible is getting ripped off by this film, wow that is stealing! And it steals from like EVERY TERRORIST MOVIE EVER. This film should fly into the 911 towers for all i care, i mean it's really bad. the main character looks like donald duck with his face squashed in and i wish he died like REALLY HARD so I wouldn't ever have to see that ugly guy again. you should go watch the grown ups 2 its way better and even if the film was good the cover art is so bad that i give it 1/10, and meen who design that stuff even a six year old like me could design it better! and the director must have been really dumb and immature to make such a bad film, i could do better two. just give me a camera OK and I film good die hard film and everyone loves it BUT THIS IS TERRBLE!!

This was so refreshing after years of the cheerfully bullet-spraying outings of Messrs Stallone and Schwarzenegger. There's plenty of military hardware and plenty of knuckle-biting moments. Really is one to savour as it sweeps you along.

    If you know that famous quote then you know what film I am talking about. Yes I know I didn't use that Yippie-Kay-ya line because its already been used too many times in other reviews. But anyway onto the film, We are talking about that amazing John Mctiernan movie Die Hard. Die Hard is basically about terrorists take over Yakitomi plaza and John McClain has to stop them. Now that sounds simple right? Well looks can be deceiving as there are many twists and turns and it all takes place in this plaza and in a few other places as well. Bruce Willis as John McClain is such a bad-ass in this movie and is easily one of the best action characters ever written. He's funny, vulgar, and overall a real character that you care for. But how can I forget one of the best villains ever in movie history: Hans Gruber. Alan Rickman plays this absolutely entertaining as hell villain and he is very different from other villains as he is very unpredictable and changes his plans when things go wrong and being calm and collect about it. His plans are absolutely deviously clever in this film. I wont go into much detail as it will spoil the movie. Alan Rickman is just so entertaining when hes on screen. Also, the secondary characters were great as well in their roles. Not to mention the cinematography is fantastic and John Mctiernan gets some awesome shots and crazy camera angles that make the film more tension-built and suspenseful but entertaining as well. Overall, this is one of the best action movies ever made by far because of the tension and entertainment value than any other action film. *In Alan Rickman voice* Now go see this movie! Now, now, now!!!

    My statement of Bad-Ass is a small compliment to this awesome action packed film. It is a film that I can safely say will go down in history as one of the greatest action movies of all time. Nearly every action sequence is close to perfection and the storyline is fantastic, I wish could tell you more of the storyline but I do not want to spoil the movie for anyone else. Also the acting by Bruce Willis and Alan Rick man is superb, making the characters come to life. Comparing this to its sequel this movie is a lot more out of line and Bad-Ass. Even if the first Die Hard was the best, the other films in the franchise are also amazingly awesome in a lot of ways. I am glad to have blessed my life with this film and wish for others to do so for their enjoyment and benefit. Yippee-Kai-Yay

    This is like so clich&eacute;d! Mission impossible is getting ripped off by this film, wow that is stealing! And it steals from like EVERY TERRORIST MOVIE EVER. This film should fly into the 911 towers for all i care, i mean it's really bad. the main character looks like donald duck with his face squashed in and i wish he died like REALLY HARD so I wouldn't ever have to see that ugly guy again. you should go watch the grown ups 2 its way better and even if the film was good the cover art is so bad that i give it 1/10, and meen who design that stuff even a six year old like me could design it better! and the director must have been really dumb and immature to make such a bad film, i could do better two. just give me a camera OK and I film good die hard film and everyone loves it BUT THIS IS TERRBLE!!

    What a movie.. what a ride.. I caught it on cable tonight for the umpteenth time and was still shaking my head in wonder and amazement at the creation that this movie is. Twenty five years later, Die Hard still entertains. Everything is just fabulous. John McTiernan.. sir, you have our utmost gratitude for this outstanding piece of cinema. Having watched it close to a hundred times now, and the admiration just keeps on increasing for the utter perfection of it all. Not a moment is out of place.. not a single line delivered by someone who is not deeply involved with their character and the situation s/he finds themselves in.. not a single instance of narration that grates or is cheesy or corny or inappropriate.. The action looks real.. the fights are brilliant.. the plot has negligible loopholes.. and absolutely everyone's performance is unbelievably good for an action movie.. I could go on and on about how well the key scenes are executed and how accomplished the entire production is, but I promised myself that this one would be without spoilers. Which is why I also can't reveal why I have knocked off that last star. Probably pedantic anyway. A last word for Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. Can we have them together in another movie please? Any movie. Any absolutely any movie. Please!

    I must admit that although Die Hard isn't my 'favourite' action film as such, it is still an excellent action film and is right up there with the best films of its genre. We begin with officer John McClane (Willis) who is on a flight from New York to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his family. His ex wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) is at a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza and John has arranged to meet her there. Whilst there, the complex is breached by a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). Hans is intent on stealing a $600 million dollar fortune which is kept in a safe at the Plaza. When the owner of the Nakatomi Plaza Joseph Yoshinobu (James Shigeta)refuses to provide Hans with the code for the safe, Hans kills him and due to the fact that no-one else knows the code he sets about trying a different method to get his hands on the cash. In the meantime, he also holds all the patrons hostage - all except one person who managed to evade capture namely 'John McClane' and he is determined to stop Hans and his goons by any means possible. A lot of the strengths in Die Hard come from the way the tension is created. Although all of this takes place in a 40 storey building, strangely enough at times there is almost a feeling of 'claustrophobia'. You see a lot of McClane in tight spaces and on a number of occasions he gets very close to his captors and I think it really helps to create an edge of your seat feel to the whole proceedings. Hans Gruber is also an excellent villain - the very fact that he is so calm, cool and calculated makes him more dangerous and ultimately more terrifying. It seems that no matter what is thrown at him, he never panics and almost views holding hostages as being like a game of chess - he always appears to be one or 2 moves ahead of everyone else. Kudos also should go to John McTiernan for his exceptional direction of Die Hard. He really has given it a 'claustrophobic' feel - much like he did with Predator. I also felt the score was excellent - although it wasn't as good as the score in Predator it still more than complemented the overall tone of the film. As with Predator, there are also plenty of humorous moments and one liners (who can forget the classic 'Yippee Ki Yay' line from McClane). The acting was also great by everyone involved (particularly by Alan Rickman). His portrayal of Hans Gruber was pretty much perfect and he will be long remembered as being one of the better villains to grace our screens. Even though Die Hard is now 25 years old, it still has a certain 'freshness' about it and it is a film that I thoroughly enjoyed.

    If someone were to force me to tell him/her my favorite movie of all time, I would most likely say Die Hard. In my opinion, this is as close to a perfect action movie you can get. Perfect characters, perfect one liners, perfect plot, perfect villain, etc. This simple yet genius movie revolutionized the idea of a lone man trapped in the wrong place at the wrong time with NYPD officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) trapped in the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles after terrorists lead by Hans Grubber (Alan Rickman) invade the building, with John only relying on all of his police training and his wits to survive this Christmas Eve from Hell. 10/10

    Review #2 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews In 1988, when Die Hard came out, my parents and a family friend went to see it in New York City in a big theater. The movie was so crowded, they all did not even get to sit together. (And I don't even think it was opening weekend!) Take that into consideration for how big a movie this was back then and still is. Die Hard is the best action movie, and probably my favorite movie, with a close second or tie with The Shawshank Redemption. Die Hard combines well-executed action scenes with cheesy but iconic one-liners and a great main character. As sarcastic, profane, and messed up John McClane is, you have to find yourself rooting for him. Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, and Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, and many others will have their acting skills defined by this movie forever. After all, it definitely gave a career boost to some, although Willis already had a nice acting resume on his plate. Nevertheless, it redefined the whole genre. Action movies consist of a bunch of key elements that come together to form a coherent picture. (At least I hope it will be coherent, as some tend to fail at this process.) They combine action scenes (obviously), at least a couple one-liners, a car (there's always a car or some kind of vehicle), a villain, and usually an explosion or two. Or three. ;-) All of these elements and many more were all in Die Hard, and it kind of changed the genre for good. You will hear people say "Oh, that movie is a Die Hard rip-off", or "That stunt was first made famous in Die Hard." It's not that action movies didn't have these elements before Die Hard, it's just that Die Hard made them better and/or famous. Die Hard will keep you on the edge of your seat, and is an extremely well-done picture that doesn't lag or slow down at all. It eases into the action in such a way that it feels natural and not forced or unnecessary. HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    John McTiernan's second mainstream film manages to amazingly top an outstanding previous effort, Predator. This even better film will resonate will audiences even more than Predator. While Predator was a superbly crafted and fairly straightforward sci-fi action thriller, this film takes the archetypal imperfect everyman loner, saddled with personal issues(in the form as an estranged relationship with is corporate high flying wife) and through a twist of fate has him battling, against the odds an international team of highly motivated and competent) bank robbers while trying to protect his wife, who is amongst the hostages these robbers have taken. It differed from both Predator and other action-thriller films of the period in that the hero was more human in physique, rather than the physical super-men such as Stallone, Norris and Schwarzenegger. He survives through determination and his wits rather than on brute strength, and Bruce Willis was a refreshingly original casting choice. The plot is cleverly structured and sets up all the characters seamlessly. There are good performances from most of the key players. The robbers are all interesting, but clearly most time is spent with Clarence Gilyard Jr. and the late Alexander Gudunov, who are both charismatic, albeit it is their boss, the relatively unknown at the time British actor Alan Rickman, who steals the show and is terrific in this film, and makes for a worthy rival and antagonist for Bruce Willis's John McClane. Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson are also good value, as is James Shigeta as Mr Takagi. However a couple of the characters do stray into caricatures, notably De'Voreaux White and Hart Bochner as Argyle and Ellis respectively. Fortunately the other performances and the film itself as so fast paced and involving you can overlook these slightly over the top performances, and they do not detract from the enjoyment of the picture. The good performances are woven into an expertly crafted film. Technical credits are outstanding. Jan De Bont's photography is stylish, and makes fantastic use of the Fox Plaza Tower to double for the Nakatomi building. He also makes clever use, but not over use of lens flares to create an excellent mood and atmosphere. Frank J Urioste's stunning editing, Michael Kamen's great music and Richard Edlund's brilliant but incredibly subtle visual effects all work together with truly fantastic action sequences and stuntwork, and director John McTiernan deserves huge credit. He draws out entertaining performances from most of the cast, but mixes this brilliantly clever setting up of the characters, and then orchestrating some truly outstanding action sequences with a pervading atmosphere of growing tension and suspense. It has stood the test of time brilliantly, it still by some way the best of the series, and overall comes off as a truly outstanding and emotionally satisfying thriller. Overall a terrific achievement that has not been bettered.

    This is one of the very best films I've ever seen at the cinema and its greatness shines through on (a decent) TV. The plot is fabulously layered yet crisp, the characters are very strong (Rickman's Hans sets the standard), the story has many wonderful character moments yet gets on with it when it needs to...wonderful stuff. In particular, Bruce's hero is brilliantly reluctant, always trying to sit out the storm rather than lead it along. This was so refreshing after years of the cheerfully bullet-spraying outings of Messrs Stallone and Schwarzenegger. There's plenty of military hardware and plenty of knuckle-biting moments. Really is one to savour as it sweeps you along.

He draws out entertaining performances from most of the cast, but mixes this brilliantly clever setting up of the characters, and then orchestrating some truly outstanding action sequences with a pervading atmosphere of growing tension and suspense. It has stood the test of time brilliantly, it still by some way the best of the series, and overall comes off as a truly outstanding and emotionally satisfying thriller. Overall a terrific achievement that has not been bettered.

    This is one of the very best films I've ever seen at the cinema and its greatness shines through on (a decent) TV. The plot is fabulously layered yet crisp, the characters are very strong (Rickman's Hans sets the standard), the story has many wonderful character moments yet gets on with it when it needs to...wonderful stuff. In particular, Bruce's hero is brilliantly reluctant, always trying to sit out the storm rather than lead it along. This was so refreshing after years of the cheerfully bullet-spraying outings of Messrs Stallone and Schwarzenegger. There's plenty of military hardware and plenty of knuckle-biting moments. Really is one to savour as it sweeps you along.

    If you know that famous quote then you know what film I am talking about. Yes I know I didn't use that Yippie-Kay-ya line because its already been used too many times in other reviews. But anyway onto the film, We are talking about that amazing John Mctiernan movie Die Hard. Die Hard is basically about terrorists take over Yakitomi plaza and John McClain has to stop them. Now that sounds simple right? Well looks can be deceiving as there are many twists and turns and it all takes place in this plaza and in a few other places as well. Bruce Willis as John McClain is such a bad-ass in this movie and is easily one of the best action characters ever written. He's funny, vulgar, and overall a real character that you care for. But how can I forget one of the best villains ever in movie history: Hans Gruber. Alan Rickman plays this absolutely entertaining as hell villain and he is very different from other villains as he is very unpredictable and changes his plans when things go wrong and being calm and collect about it. His plans are absolutely deviously clever in this film. I wont go into much detail as it will spoil the movie. Alan Rickman is just so entertaining when hes on screen. Also, the secondary characters were great as well in their roles. Not to mention the cinematography is fantastic and John Mctiernan gets some awesome shots and crazy camera angles that make the film more tension-built and suspenseful but entertaining as well. Overall, this is one of the best action movies ever made by far because of the tension and entertainment value than any other action film. *In Alan Rickman voice* Now go see this movie! Now, now, now!!!

    My statement of Bad-Ass is a small compliment to this awesome action packed film. It is a film that I can safely say will go down in history as one of the greatest action movies of all time. Nearly every action sequence is close to perfection and the storyline is fantastic, I wish could tell you more of the storyline but I do not want to spoil the movie for anyone else. Also the acting by Bruce Willis and Alan Rick man is superb, making the characters come to life. Comparing this to its sequel this movie is a lot more out of line and Bad-Ass. Even if the first Die Hard was the best, the other films in the franchise are also amazingly awesome in a lot of ways. I am glad to have blessed my life with this film and wish for others to do so for their enjoyment and benefit. Yippee-Kai-Yay

    This is like so clich&eacute;d! Mission impossible is getting ripped off by this film, wow that is stealing! And it steals from like EVERY TERRORIST MOVIE EVER. This film should fly into the 911 towers for all i care, i mean it's really bad. the main character looks like donald duck with his face squashed in and i wish he died like REALLY HARD so I wouldn't ever have to see that ugly guy again. you should go watch the grown ups 2 its way better and even if the film was good the cover art is so bad that i give it 1/10, and meen who design that stuff even a six year old like me could design it better! and the director must have been really dumb and immature to make such a bad film, i could do better two. just give me a camera OK and I film good die hard film and everyone loves it BUT THIS IS TERRBLE!!

    What a movie.. what a ride.. I caught it on cable tonight for the umpteenth time and was still shaking my head in wonder and amazement at the creation that this movie is. Twenty five years later, Die Hard still entertains. Everything is just fabulous. John McTiernan.. sir, you have our utmost gratitude for this outstanding piece of cinema. Having watched it close to a hundred times now, and the admiration just keeps on increasing for the utter perfection of it all. Not a moment is out of place.. not a single line delivered by someone who is not deeply involved with their character and the situation s/he finds themselves in.. not a single instance of narration that grates or is cheesy or corny or inappropriate.. The action looks real.. the fights are brilliant.. the plot has negligible loopholes.. and absolutely everyone's performance is unbelievably good for an action movie.. I could go on and on about how well the key scenes are executed and how accomplished the entire production is, but I promised myself that this one would be without spoilers. Which is why I also can't reveal why I have knocked off that last star. Probably pedantic anyway. A last word for Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. Can we have them together in another movie please? Any movie. Any absolutely any movie. Please!

    I must admit that although Die Hard isn't my 'favourite' action film as such, it is still an excellent action film and is right up there with the best films of its genre. We begin with officer John McClane (Willis) who is on a flight from New York to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his family. His ex wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) is at a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza and John has arranged to meet her there. Whilst there, the complex is breached by a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). Hans is intent on stealing a $600 million dollar fortune which is kept in a safe at the Plaza. When the owner of the Nakatomi Plaza Joseph Yoshinobu (James Shigeta)refuses to provide Hans with the code for the safe, Hans kills him and due to the fact that no-one else knows the code he sets about trying a different method to get his hands on the cash. In the meantime, he also holds all the patrons hostage - all except one person who managed to evade capture namely 'John McClane' and he is determined to stop Hans and his goons by any means possible. A lot of the strengths in Die Hard come from the way the tension is created. Although all of this takes place in a 40 storey building, strangely enough at times there is almost a feeling of 'claustrophobia'. You see a lot of McClane in tight spaces and on a number of occasions he gets very close to his captors and I think it really helps to create an edge of your seat feel to the whole proceedings. Hans Gruber is also an excellent villain - the very fact that he is so calm, cool and calculated makes him more dangerous and ultimately more terrifying. It seems that no matter what is thrown at him, he never panics and almost views holding hostages as being like a game of chess - he always appears to be one or 2 moves ahead of everyone else. Kudos also should go to John McTiernan for his exceptional direction of Die Hard. He really has given it a 'claustrophobic' feel - much like he did with Predator. I also felt the score was excellent - although it wasn't as good as the score in Predator it still more than complemented the overall tone of the film. As with Predator, there are also plenty of humorous moments and one liners (who can forget the classic 'Yippee Ki Yay' line from McClane). The acting was also great by everyone involved (particularly by Alan Rickman). His portrayal of Hans Gruber was pretty much perfect and he will be long remembered as being one of the better villains to grace our screens. Even though Die Hard is now 25 years old, it still has a certain 'freshness' about it and it is a film that I thoroughly enjoyed.

    If someone were to force me to tell him/her my favorite movie of all time, I would most likely say Die Hard. In my opinion, this is as close to a perfect action movie you can get. Perfect characters, perfect one liners, perfect plot, perfect villain, etc. This simple yet genius movie revolutionized the idea of a lone man trapped in the wrong place at the wrong time with NYPD officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) trapped in the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles after terrorists lead by Hans Grubber (Alan Rickman) invade the building, with John only relying on all of his police training and his wits to survive this Christmas Eve from Hell. 10/10

    Review #2 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews In 1988, when Die Hard came out, my parents and a family friend went to see it in New York City in a big theater. The movie was so crowded, they all did not even get to sit together. (And I don't even think it was opening weekend!) Take that into consideration for how big a movie this was back then and still is. Die Hard is the best action movie, and probably my favorite movie, with a close second or tie with The Shawshank Redemption. Die Hard combines well-executed action scenes with cheesy but iconic one-liners and a great main character. As sarcastic, profane, and messed up John McClane is, you have to find yourself rooting for him. Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, and Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, and many others will have their acting skills defined by this movie forever. After all, it definitely gave a career boost to some, although Willis already had a nice acting resume on his plate. Nevertheless, it redefined the whole genre. Action movies consist of a bunch of key elements that come together to form a coherent picture. (At least I hope it will be coherent, as some tend to fail at this process.) They combine action scenes (obviously), at least a couple one-liners, a car (there's always a car or some kind of vehicle), a villain, and usually an explosion or two. Or three. ;-) All of these elements and many more were all in Die Hard, and it kind of changed the genre for good. You will hear people say "Oh, that movie is a Die Hard rip-off", or "That stunt was first made famous in Die Hard." It's not that action movies didn't have these elements before Die Hard, it's just that Die Hard made them better and/or famous. Die Hard will keep you on the edge of your seat, and is an extremely well-done picture that doesn't lag or slow down at all. It eases into the action in such a way that it feels natural and not forced or unnecessary. HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    John McTiernan's second mainstream film manages to amazingly top an outstanding previous effort, Predator. This even better film will resonate will audiences even more than Predator. While Predator was a superbly crafted and fairly straightforward sci-fi action thriller, this film takes the archetypal imperfect everyman loner, saddled with personal issues(in the form as an estranged relationship with is corporate high flying wife) and through a twist of fate has him battling, against the odds an international team of highly motivated and competent) bank robbers while trying to protect his wife, who is amongst the hostages these robbers have taken. It differed from both Predator and other action-thriller films of the period in that the hero was more human in physique, rather than the physical super-men such as Stallone, Norris and Schwarzenegger. He survives through determination and his wits rather than on brute strength, and Bruce Willis was a refreshingly original casting choice. The plot is cleverly structured and sets up all the characters seamlessly. There are good performances from most of the key players. The robbers are all interesting, but clearly most time is spent with Clarence Gilyard Jr. and the late Alexander Gudunov, who are both charismatic, albeit it is their boss, the relatively unknown at the time British actor Alan Rickman, who steals the show and is terrific in this film, and makes for a worthy rival and antagonist for Bruce Willis's John McClane. Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson are also good value, as is James Shigeta as Mr Takagi. However a couple of the characters do stray into caricatures, notably De'Voreaux White and Hart Bochner as Argyle and Ellis respectively. Fortunately the other performances and the film itself as so fast paced and involving you can overlook these slightly over the top performances, and they do not detract from the enjoyment of the picture. The good performances are woven into an expertly crafted film. Technical credits are outstanding. Jan De Bont's photography is stylish, and makes fantastic use of the Fox Plaza Tower to double for the Nakatomi building. He also makes clever use, but not over use of lens flares to create an excellent mood and atmosphere. Frank J Urioste's stunning editing, Michael Kamen's great music and Richard Edlund's brilliant but incredibly subtle visual effects all work together with truly fantastic action sequences and stuntwork, and director John McTiernan deserves huge credit. He draws out entertaining performances from most of the cast, but mixes this brilliantly clever setting up of the characters, and then orchestrating some truly outstanding action sequences with a pervading atmosphere of growing tension and suspense. It has stood the test of time brilliantly, it still by some way the best of the series, and overall comes off as a truly outstanding and emotionally satisfying thriller. Overall a terrific achievement that has not been bettered.

It eases into the action in such a way that it feels natural and not forced or unnecessary. HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    John McTiernan's second mainstream film manages to amazingly top an outstanding previous effort, Predator. This even better film will resonate will audiences even more than Predator. While Predator was a superbly crafted and fairly straightforward sci-fi action thriller, this film takes the archetypal imperfect everyman loner, saddled with personal issues(in the form as an estranged relationship with is corporate high flying wife) and through a twist of fate has him battling, against the odds an international team of highly motivated and competent) bank robbers while trying to protect his wife, who is amongst the hostages these robbers have taken. It differed from both Predator and other action-thriller films of the period in that the hero was more human in physique, rather than the physical super-men such as Stallone, Norris and Schwarzenegger. He survives through determination and his wits rather than on brute strength, and Bruce Willis was a refreshingly original casting choice. The plot is cleverly structured and sets up all the characters seamlessly. There are good performances from most of the key players. The robbers are all interesting, but clearly most time is spent with Clarence Gilyard Jr. and the late Alexander Gudunov, who are both charismatic, albeit it is their boss, the relatively unknown at the time British actor Alan Rickman, who steals the show and is terrific in this film, and makes for a worthy rival and antagonist for Bruce Willis's John McClane. Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson are also good value, as is James Shigeta as Mr Takagi. However a couple of the characters do stray into caricatures, notably De'Voreaux White and Hart Bochner as Argyle and Ellis respectively. Fortunately the other performances and the film itself as so fast paced and involving you can overlook these slightly over the top performances, and they do not detract from the enjoyment of the picture. The good performances are woven into an expertly crafted film. Technical credits are outstanding. Jan De Bont's photography is stylish, and makes fantastic use of the Fox Plaza Tower to double for the Nakatomi building. He also makes clever use, but not over use of lens flares to create an excellent mood and atmosphere. Frank J Urioste's stunning editing, Michael Kamen's great music and Richard Edlund's brilliant but incredibly subtle visual effects all work together with truly fantastic action sequences and stuntwork, and director John McTiernan deserves huge credit. He draws out entertaining performances from most of the cast, but mixes this brilliantly clever setting up of the characters, and then orchestrating some truly outstanding action sequences with a pervading atmosphere of growing tension and suspense. It has stood the test of time brilliantly, it still by some way the best of the series, and overall comes off as a truly outstanding and emotionally satisfying thriller. Overall a terrific achievement that has not been bettered.

    This is one of the very best films I've ever seen at the cinema and its greatness shines through on (a decent) TV. The plot is fabulously layered yet crisp, the characters are very strong (Rickman's Hans sets the standard), the story has many wonderful character moments yet gets on with it when it needs to...wonderful stuff. In particular, Bruce's hero is brilliantly reluctant, always trying to sit out the storm rather than lead it along. This was so refreshing after years of the cheerfully bullet-spraying outings of Messrs Stallone and Schwarzenegger. There's plenty of military hardware and plenty of knuckle-biting moments. Really is one to savour as it sweeps you along.

    If you know that famous quote then you know what film I am talking about. Yes I know I didn't use that Yippie-Kay-ya line because its already been used too many times in other reviews. But anyway onto the film, We are talking about that amazing John Mctiernan movie Die Hard. Die Hard is basically about terrorists take over Yakitomi plaza and John McClain has to stop them. Now that sounds simple right? Well looks can be deceiving as there are many twists and turns and it all takes place in this plaza and in a few other places as well. Bruce Willis as John McClain is such a bad-ass in this movie and is easily one of the best action characters ever written. He's funny, vulgar, and overall a real character that you care for. But how can I forget one of the best villains ever in movie history: Hans Gruber. Alan Rickman plays this absolutely entertaining as hell villain and he is very different from other villains as he is very unpredictable and changes his plans when things go wrong and being calm and collect about it. His plans are absolutely deviously clever in this film. I wont go into much detail as it will spoil the movie. Alan Rickman is just so entertaining when hes on screen. Also, the secondary characters were great as well in their roles. Not to mention the cinematography is fantastic and John Mctiernan gets some awesome shots and crazy camera angles that make the film more tension-built and suspenseful but entertaining as well. Overall, this is one of the best action movies ever made by far because of the tension and entertainment value than any other action film. *In Alan Rickman voice* Now go see this movie! Now, now, now!!!

    My statement of Bad-Ass is a small compliment to this awesome action packed film. It is a film that I can safely say will go down in history as one of the greatest action movies of all time. Nearly every action sequence is close to perfection and the storyline is fantastic, I wish could tell you more of the storyline but I do not want to spoil the movie for anyone else. Also the acting by Bruce Willis and Alan Rick man is superb, making the characters come to life. Comparing this to its sequel this movie is a lot more out of line and Bad-Ass. Even if the first Die Hard was the best, the other films in the franchise are also amazingly awesome in a lot of ways. I am glad to have blessed my life with this film and wish for others to do so for their enjoyment and benefit. Yippee-Kai-Yay

    This is like so clich&eacute;d! Mission impossible is getting ripped off by this film, wow that is stealing! And it steals from like EVERY TERRORIST MOVIE EVER. This film should fly into the 911 towers for all i care, i mean it's really bad. the main character looks like donald duck with his face squashed in and i wish he died like REALLY HARD so I wouldn't ever have to see that ugly guy again. you should go watch the grown ups 2 its way better and even if the film was good the cover art is so bad that i give it 1/10, and meen who design that stuff even a six year old like me could design it better! and the director must have been really dumb and immature to make such a bad film, i could do better two. just give me a camera OK and I film good die hard film and everyone loves it BUT THIS IS TERRBLE!!

    What a movie.. what a ride.. I caught it on cable tonight for the umpteenth time and was still shaking my head in wonder and amazement at the creation that this movie is. Twenty five years later, Die Hard still entertains. Everything is just fabulous. John McTiernan.. sir, you have our utmost gratitude for this outstanding piece of cinema. Having watched it close to a hundred times now, and the admiration just keeps on increasing for the utter perfection of it all. Not a moment is out of place.. not a single line delivered by someone who is not deeply involved with their character and the situation s/he finds themselves in.. not a single instance of narration that grates or is cheesy or corny or inappropriate.. The action looks real.. the fights are brilliant.. the plot has negligible loopholes.. and absolutely everyone's performance is unbelievably good for an action movie.. I could go on and on about how well the key scenes are executed and how accomplished the entire production is, but I promised myself that this one would be without spoilers. Which is why I also can't reveal why I have knocked off that last star. Probably pedantic anyway. A last word for Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. Can we have them together in another movie please? Any movie. Any absolutely any movie. Please!

    I must admit that although Die Hard isn't my 'favourite' action film as such, it is still an excellent action film and is right up there with the best films of its genre. We begin with officer John McClane (Willis) who is on a flight from New York to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his family. His ex wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) is at a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza and John has arranged to meet her there. Whilst there, the complex is breached by a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). Hans is intent on stealing a $600 million dollar fortune which is kept in a safe at the Plaza. When the owner of the Nakatomi Plaza Joseph Yoshinobu (James Shigeta)refuses to provide Hans with the code for the safe, Hans kills him and due to the fact that no-one else knows the code he sets about trying a different method to get his hands on the cash. In the meantime, he also holds all the patrons hostage - all except one person who managed to evade capture namely 'John McClane' and he is determined to stop Hans and his goons by any means possible. A lot of the strengths in Die Hard come from the way the tension is created. Although all of this takes place in a 40 storey building, strangely enough at times there is almost a feeling of 'claustrophobia'. You see a lot of McClane in tight spaces and on a number of occasions he gets very close to his captors and I think it really helps to create an edge of your seat feel to the whole proceedings. Hans Gruber is also an excellent villain - the very fact that he is so calm, cool and calculated makes him more dangerous and ultimately more terrifying. It seems that no matter what is thrown at him, he never panics and almost views holding hostages as being like a game of chess - he always appears to be one or 2 moves ahead of everyone else. Kudos also should go to John McTiernan for his exceptional direction of Die Hard. He really has given it a 'claustrophobic' feel - much like he did with Predator. I also felt the score was excellent - although it wasn't as good as the score in Predator it still more than complemented the overall tone of the film. As with Predator, there are also plenty of humorous moments and one liners (who can forget the classic 'Yippee Ki Yay' line from McClane). The acting was also great by everyone involved (particularly by Alan Rickman). His portrayal of Hans Gruber was pretty much perfect and he will be long remembered as being one of the better villains to grace our screens. Even though Die Hard is now 25 years old, it still has a certain 'freshness' about it and it is a film that I thoroughly enjoyed.

    If someone were to force me to tell him/her my favorite movie of all time, I would most likely say Die Hard. In my opinion, this is as close to a perfect action movie you can get. Perfect characters, perfect one liners, perfect plot, perfect villain, etc. This simple yet genius movie revolutionized the idea of a lone man trapped in the wrong place at the wrong time with NYPD officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) trapped in the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles after terrorists lead by Hans Grubber (Alan Rickman) invade the building, with John only relying on all of his police training and his wits to survive this Christmas Eve from Hell. 10/10

    Review #2 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews In 1988, when Die Hard came out, my parents and a family friend went to see it in New York City in a big theater. The movie was so crowded, they all did not even get to sit together. (And I don't even think it was opening weekend!) Take that into consideration for how big a movie this was back then and still is. Die Hard is the best action movie, and probably my favorite movie, with a close second or tie with The Shawshank Redemption. Die Hard combines well-executed action scenes with cheesy but iconic one-liners and a great main character. As sarcastic, profane, and messed up John McClane is, you have to find yourself rooting for him. Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, and Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, and many others will have their acting skills defined by this movie forever. After all, it definitely gave a career boost to some, although Willis already had a nice acting resume on his plate. Nevertheless, it redefined the whole genre. Action movies consist of a bunch of key elements that come together to form a coherent picture. (At least I hope it will be coherent, as some tend to fail at this process.) They combine action scenes (obviously), at least a couple one-liners, a car (there's always a car or some kind of vehicle), a villain, and usually an explosion or two. Or three. ;-) All of these elements and many more were all in Die Hard, and it kind of changed the genre for good. You will hear people say "Oh, that movie is a Die Hard rip-off", or "That stunt was first made famous in Die Hard." It's not that action movies didn't have these elements before Die Hard, it's just that Die Hard made them better and/or famous. Die Hard will keep you on the edge of your seat, and is an extremely well-done picture that doesn't lag or slow down at all. It eases into the action in such a way that it feels natural and not forced or unnecessary. HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    John McTiernan's second mainstream film manages to amazingly top an outstanding previous effort, Predator. This even better film will resonate will audiences even more than Predator. While Predator was a superbly crafted and fairly straightforward sci-fi action thriller, this film takes the archetypal imperfect everyman loner, saddled with personal issues(in the form as an estranged relationship with is corporate high flying wife) and through a twist of fate has him battling, against the odds an international team of highly motivated and competent) bank robbers while trying to protect his wife, who is amongst the hostages these robbers have taken. It differed from both Predator and other action-thriller films of the period in that the hero was more human in physique, rather than the physical super-men such as Stallone, Norris and Schwarzenegger. He survives through determination and his wits rather than on brute strength, and Bruce Willis was a refreshingly original casting choice. The plot is cleverly structured and sets up all the characters seamlessly. There are good performances from most of the key players. The robbers are all interesting, but clearly most time is spent with Clarence Gilyard Jr. and the late Alexander Gudunov, who are both charismatic, albeit it is their boss, the relatively unknown at the time British actor Alan Rickman, who steals the show and is terrific in this film, and makes for a worthy rival and antagonist for Bruce Willis's John McClane. Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson are also good value, as is James Shigeta as Mr Takagi. However a couple of the characters do stray into caricatures, notably De'Voreaux White and Hart Bochner as Argyle and Ellis respectively. Fortunately the other performances and the film itself as so fast paced and involving you can overlook these slightly over the top performances, and they do not detract from the enjoyment of the picture. The good performances are woven into an expertly crafted film. Technical credits are outstanding. Jan De Bont's photography is stylish, and makes fantastic use of the Fox Plaza Tower to double for the Nakatomi building. He also makes clever use, but not over use of lens flares to create an excellent mood and atmosphere. Frank J Urioste's stunning editing, Michael Kamen's great music and Richard Edlund's brilliant but incredibly subtle visual effects all work together with truly fantastic action sequences and stuntwork, and director John McTiernan deserves huge credit. He draws out entertaining performances from most of the cast, but mixes this brilliantly clever setting up of the characters, and then orchestrating some truly outstanding action sequences with a pervading atmosphere of growing tension and suspense. It has stood the test of time brilliantly, it still by some way the best of the series, and overall comes off as a truly outstanding and emotionally satisfying thriller.

Perfect characters, perfect one liners, perfect plot, perfect villain, etc. This simple yet genius movie revolutionized the idea of a lone man trapped in the wrong place at the wrong time with NYPD officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) trapped in the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles after terrorists lead by Hans Grubber (Alan Rickman) invade the building, with John only relying on all of his police training and his wits to survive this Christmas Eve from Hell. 10/10

    Review #2 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews In 1988, when Die Hard came out, my parents and a family friend went to see it in New York City in a big theater. The movie was so crowded, they all did not even get to sit together. (And I don't even think it was opening weekend!) Take that into consideration for how big a movie this was back then and still is. Die Hard is the best action movie, and probably my favorite movie, with a close second or tie with The Shawshank Redemption. Die Hard combines well-executed action scenes with cheesy but iconic one-liners and a great main character. As sarcastic, profane, and messed up John McClane is, you have to find yourself rooting for him. Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, and Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, and many others will have their acting skills defined by this movie forever. After all, it definitely gave a career boost to some, although Willis already had a nice acting resume on his plate. Nevertheless, it redefined the whole genre. Action movies consist of a bunch of key elements that come together to form a coherent picture. (At least I hope it will be coherent, as some tend to fail at this process.) They combine action scenes (obviously), at least a couple one-liners, a car (there's always a car or some kind of vehicle), a villain, and usually an explosion or two. Or three. ;-) All of these elements and many more were all in Die Hard, and it kind of changed the genre for good. You will hear people say "Oh, that movie is a Die Hard rip-off", or "That stunt was first made famous in Die Hard." It's not that action movies didn't have these elements before Die Hard, it's just that Die Hard made them better and/or famous. Die Hard will keep you on the edge of your seat, and is an extremely well-done picture that doesn't lag or slow down at all. It eases into the action in such a way that it feels natural and not forced or unnecessary. HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    John McTiernan's second mainstream film manages to amazingly top an outstanding previous effort, Predator. This even better film will resonate will audiences even more than Predator. While Predator was a superbly crafted and fairly straightforward sci-fi action thriller, this film takes the archetypal imperfect everyman loner, saddled with personal issues(in the form as an estranged relationship with is corporate high flying wife) and through a twist of fate has him battling, against the odds an international team of highly motivated and competent) bank robbers while trying to protect his wife, who is amongst the hostages these robbers have taken. It differed from both Predator and other action-thriller films of the period in that the hero was more human in physique, rather than the physical super-men such as Stallone, Norris and Schwarzenegger. He survives through determination and his wits rather than on brute strength, and Bruce Willis was a refreshingly original casting choice. The plot is cleverly structured and sets up all the characters seamlessly. There are good performances from most of the key players. The robbers are all interesting, but clearly most time is spent with Clarence Gilyard Jr. and the late Alexander Gudunov, who are both charismatic, albeit it is their boss, the relatively unknown at the time British actor Alan Rickman, who steals the show and is terrific in this film, and makes for a worthy rival and antagonist for Bruce Willis's John McClane. Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson are also good value, as is James Shigeta as Mr Takagi. However a couple of the characters do stray into caricatures, notably De'Voreaux White and Hart Bochner as Argyle and Ellis respectively. Fortunately the other performances and the film itself as so fast paced and involving you can overlook these slightly over the top performances, and they do not detract from the enjoyment of the picture. The good performances are woven into an expertly crafted film. Technical credits are outstanding. Jan De Bont's photography is stylish, and makes fantastic use of the Fox Plaza Tower to double for the Nakatomi building. He also makes clever use, but not over use of lens flares to create an excellent mood and atmosphere. Frank J Urioste's stunning editing, Michael Kamen's great music and Richard Edlund's brilliant but incredibly subtle visual effects all work together with truly fantastic action sequences and stuntwork, and director John McTiernan deserves huge credit. He draws out entertaining performances from most of the cast, but mixes this brilliantly clever setting up of the characters, and then orchestrating some truly outstanding action sequences with a pervading atmosphere of growing tension and suspense. It has stood the test of time brilliantly, it still by some way the best of the series, and overall comes off as a truly outstanding and emotionally satisfying thriller. Overall a terrific achievement that has not been bettered.

    This is one of the very best films I've ever seen at the cinema and its greatness shines through on (a decent) TV. The plot is fabulously layered yet crisp, the characters are very strong (Rickman's Hans sets the standard), the story has many wonderful character moments yet gets on with it when it needs to...wonderful stuff. In particular, Bruce's hero is brilliantly reluctant, always trying to sit out the storm rather than lead it along. This was so refreshing after years of the cheerfully bullet-spraying outings of Messrs Stallone and Schwarzenegger. There's plenty of military hardware and plenty of knuckle-biting moments. Really is one to savour as it sweeps you along.

    If you know that famous quote then you know what film I am talking about. Yes I know I didn't use that Yippie-Kay-ya line because its already been used too many times in other reviews. But anyway onto the film, We are talking about that amazing John Mctiernan movie Die Hard. Die Hard is basically about terrorists take over Yakitomi plaza and John McClain has to stop them. Now that sounds simple right? Well looks can be deceiving as there are many twists and turns and it all takes place in this plaza and in a few other places as well. Bruce Willis as John McClain is such a bad-ass in this movie and is easily one of the best action characters ever written. He's funny, vulgar, and overall a real character that you care for. But how can I forget one of the best villains ever in movie history: Hans Gruber. Alan Rickman plays this absolutely entertaining as hell villain and he is very different from other villains as he is very unpredictable and changes his plans when things go wrong and being calm and collect about it. His plans are absolutely deviously clever in this film. I wont go into much detail as it will spoil the movie. Alan Rickman is just so entertaining when hes on screen. Also, the secondary characters were great as well in their roles. Not to mention the cinematography is fantastic and John Mctiernan gets some awesome shots and crazy camera angles that make the film more tension-built and suspenseful but entertaining as well. Overall, this is one of the best action movies ever made by far because of the tension and entertainment value than any other action film. *In Alan Rickman voice* Now go see this movie! Now, now, now!!!

    My statement of Bad-Ass is a small compliment to this awesome action packed film. It is a film that I can safely say will go down in history as one of the greatest action movies of all time. Nearly every action sequence is close to perfection and the storyline is fantastic, I wish could tell you more of the storyline but I do not want to spoil the movie for anyone else. Also the acting by Bruce Willis and Alan Rick man is superb, making the characters come to life. Comparing this to its sequel this movie is a lot more out of line and Bad-Ass. Even if the first Die Hard was the best, the other films in the franchise are also amazingly awesome in a lot of ways. I am glad to have blessed my life with this film and wish for others to do so for their enjoyment and benefit. Yippee-Kai-Yay

    This is like so clich&eacute;d! Mission impossible is getting ripped off by this film, wow that is stealing! And it steals from like EVERY TERRORIST MOVIE EVER. This film should fly into the 911 towers for all i care, i mean it's really bad. the main character looks like donald duck with his face squashed in and i wish he died like REALLY HARD so I wouldn't ever have to see that ugly guy again. you should go watch the grown ups 2 its way better and even if the film was good the cover art is so bad that i give it 1/10, and meen who design that stuff even a six year old like me could design it better! and the director must have been really dumb and immature to make such a bad film, i could do better two. just give me a camera OK and I film good die hard film and everyone loves it BUT THIS IS TERRBLE!!

    What a movie.. what a ride.. I caught it on cable tonight for the umpteenth time and was still shaking my head in wonder and amazement at the creation that this movie is. Twenty five years later, Die Hard still entertains. Everything is just fabulous. John McTiernan.. sir, you have our utmost gratitude for this outstanding piece of cinema. Having watched it close to a hundred times now, and the admiration just keeps on increasing for the utter perfection of it all. Not a moment is out of place.. not a single line delivered by someone who is not deeply involved with their character and the situation s/he finds themselves in.. not a single instance of narration that grates or is cheesy or corny or inappropriate.. The action looks real.. the fights are brilliant.. the plot has negligible loopholes.. and absolutely everyone's performance is unbelievably good for an action movie.. I could go on and on about how well the key scenes are executed and how accomplished the entire production is, but I promised myself that this one would be without spoilers. Which is why I also can't reveal why I have knocked off that last star. Probably pedantic anyway. A last word for Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. Can we have them together in another movie please? Any movie. Any absolutely any movie. Please!

    I must admit that although Die Hard isn't my 'favourite' action film as such, it is still an excellent action film and is right up there with the best films of its genre. We begin with officer John McClane (Willis) who is on a flight from New York to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his family. His ex wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) is at a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza and John has arranged to meet her there. Whilst there, the complex is breached by a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). Hans is intent on stealing a $600 million dollar fortune which is kept in a safe at the Plaza. When the owner of the Nakatomi Plaza Joseph Yoshinobu (James Shigeta)refuses to provide Hans with the code for the safe, Hans kills him and due to the fact that no-one else knows the code he sets about trying a different method to get his hands on the cash. In the meantime, he also holds all the patrons hostage - all except one person who managed to evade capture namely 'John McClane' and he is determined to stop Hans and his goons by any means possible. A lot of the strengths in Die Hard come from the way the tension is created. Although all of this takes place in a 40 storey building, strangely enough at times there is almost a feeling of 'claustrophobia'. You see a lot of McClane in tight spaces and on a number of occasions he gets very close to his captors and I think it really helps to create an edge of your seat feel to the whole proceedings. Hans Gruber is also an excellent villain - the very fact that he is so calm, cool and calculated makes him more dangerous and ultimately more terrifying. It seems that no matter what is thrown at him, he never panics and almost views holding hostages as being like a game of chess - he always appears to be one or 2 moves ahead of everyone else. Kudos also should go to John McTiernan for his exceptional direction of Die Hard. He really has given it a 'claustrophobic' feel - much like he did with Predator. I also felt the score was excellent - although it wasn't as good as the score in Predator it still more than complemented the overall tone of the film. As with Predator, there are also plenty of humorous moments and one liners (who can forget the classic 'Yippee Ki Yay' line from McClane). The acting was also great by everyone involved (particularly by Alan Rickman). His portrayal of Hans Gruber was pretty much perfect and he will be long remembered as being one of the better villains to grace our screens. Even though Die Hard is now 25 years old, it still has a certain 'freshness' about it and it is a film that I thoroughly enjoyed.

When the owner of the Nakatomi Plaza Joseph Yoshinobu (James Shigeta)refuses to provide Hans with the code for the safe, Hans kills him and due to the fact that no-one else knows the code he sets about trying a different method to get his hands on the cash. In the meantime, he also holds all the patrons hostage - all except one person who managed to evade capture namely 'John McClane' and he is determined to stop Hans and his goons by any means possible. A lot of the strengths in Die Hard come from the way the tension is created. Although all of this takes place in a 40 storey building, strangely enough at times there is almost a feeling of 'claustrophobia'. You see a lot of McClane in tight spaces and on a number of occasions he gets very close to his captors and I think it really helps to create an edge of your seat feel to the whole proceedings. Hans Gruber is also an excellent villain - the very fact that he is so calm, cool and calculated makes him more dangerous and ultimately more terrifying. It seems that no matter what is thrown at him, he never panics and almost views holding hostages as being like a game of chess - he always appears to be one or 2 moves ahead of everyone else. Kudos also should go to John McTiernan for his exceptional direction of Die Hard. He really has given it a 'claustrophobic' feel - much like he did with Predator. I also felt the score was excellent - although it wasn't as good as the score in Predator it still more than complemented the overall tone of the film. As with Predator, there are also plenty of humorous moments and one liners (who can forget the classic 'Yippee Ki Yay' line from McClane). The acting was also great by everyone involved (particularly by Alan Rickman). His portrayal of Hans Gruber was pretty much perfect and he will be long remembered as being one of the better villains to grace our screens. Even though Die Hard is now 25 years old, it still has a certain 'freshness' about it and it is a film that I thoroughly enjoyed.

    If someone were to force me to tell him/her my favorite movie of all time, I would most likely say Die Hard. In my opinion, this is as close to a perfect action movie you can get. Perfect characters, perfect one liners, perfect plot, perfect villain, etc. This simple yet genius movie revolutionized the idea of a lone man trapped in the wrong place at the wrong time with NYPD officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) trapped in the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles after terrorists lead by Hans Grubber (Alan Rickman) invade the building, with John only relying on all of his police training and his wits to survive this Christmas Eve from Hell. 10/10

    Review #2 of "My Top Ten Favorite Movies" Reviews In 1988, when Die Hard came out, my parents and a family friend went to see it in New York City in a big theater. The movie was so crowded, they all did not even get to sit together. (And I don't even think it was opening weekend!) Take that into consideration for how big a movie this was back then and still is. Die Hard is the best action movie, and probably my favorite movie, with a close second or tie with The Shawshank Redemption. Die Hard combines well-executed action scenes with cheesy but iconic one-liners and a great main character. As sarcastic, profane, and messed up John McClane is, you have to find yourself rooting for him. Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, and Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, and many others will have their acting skills defined by this movie forever. After all, it definitely gave a career boost to some, although Willis already had a nice acting resume on his plate. Nevertheless, it redefined the whole genre. Action movies consist of a bunch of key elements that come together to form a coherent picture. (At least I hope it will be coherent, as some tend to fail at this process.) They combine action scenes (obviously), at least a couple one-liners, a car (there's always a car or some kind of vehicle), a villain, and usually an explosion or two. Or three. ;-) All of these elements and many more were all in Die Hard, and it kind of changed the genre for good. You will hear people say "Oh, that movie is a Die Hard rip-off", or "That stunt was first made famous in Die Hard." It's not that action movies didn't have these elements before Die Hard, it's just that Die Hard made them better and/or famous. Die Hard will keep you on the edge of your seat, and is an extremely well-done picture that doesn't lag or slow down at all. It eases into the action in such a way that it feels natural and not forced or unnecessary. HandHStudios Rating: 10/10

    John McTiernan's second mainstream film manages to amazingly top an outstanding previous effort, Predator. This even better film will resonate will audiences even more than Predator. While Predator was a superbly crafted and fairly straightforward sci-fi action thriller, this film takes the archetypal imperfect everyman loner, saddled with personal issues(in the form as an estranged relationship with is corporate high flying wife) and through a twist of fate has him battling, against the odds an international team of highly motivated and competent) bank robbers while trying to protect his wife, who is amongst the hostages these robbers have taken. It differed from both Predator and other action-thriller films of the period in that the hero was more human in physique, rather than the physical super-men such as Stallone, Norris and Schwarzenegger. He survives through determination and his wits rather than on brute strength, and Bruce Willis was a refreshingly original casting choice. The plot is cleverly structured and sets up all the characters seamlessly. There are good performances from most of the key players. The robbers are all interesting, but clearly most time is spent with Clarence Gilyard Jr. and the late Alexander Gudunov, who are both charismatic, albeit it is their boss, the relatively unknown at the time British actor Alan Rickman, who steals the show and is terrific in this film, and makes for a worthy rival and antagonist for Bruce Willis's John McClane. Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson are also good value, as is James Shigeta as Mr Takagi. However a couple of the characters do stray into caricatures, notably De'Voreaux White and Hart Bochner as Argyle and Ellis respectively. Fortunately the other performances and the film itself as so fast paced and involving you can overlook these slightly over the top performances, and they do not detract from the enjoyment of the picture. The good performances are woven into an expertly crafted film. Technical credits are outstanding. Jan De Bont's photography is stylish, and makes fantastic use of the Fox Plaza Tower to double for the Nakatomi building. He also makes clever use, but not over use of lens flares to create an excellent mood and atmosphere. Frank J Urioste's stunning editing, Michael Kamen's great music and Richard Edlund's brilliant but incredibly subtle visual effects all work together with truly fantastic action sequences and stuntwork, and director John McTiernan deserves huge credit. He draws out entertaining performances from most of the cast, but mixes this brilliantly clever setting up of the characters, and then orchestrating some truly outstanding action sequences with a pervading atmosphere of growing tension and suspense. It has stood the test of time brilliantly, it still by some way the best of the series, and overall comes off as a truly outstanding and emotionally satisfying thriller. Overall a terrific achievement that has not been bettered.

    This is one of the very best films I've ever seen at the cinema and its greatness shines through on (a decent) TV. The plot is fabulously layered yet crisp, the characters are very strong (Rickman's Hans sets the standard), the story has many wonderful character moments yet gets on with it when it needs to...wonderful stuff. In particular, Bruce's hero is brilliantly reluctant, always trying to sit out the storm rather than lead it along. This was so refreshing after years of the cheerfully bullet-spraying outings of Messrs Stallone and Schwarzenegger. There's plenty of military hardware and plenty of knuckle-biting moments. Really is one to savour as it sweeps you along.

    If you know that famous quote then you know what film I am talking about. Yes I know I didn't use that Yippie-Kay-ya line because its already been used too many times in other reviews. But anyway onto the film, We are talking about that amazing John Mctiernan movie Die Hard. Die Hard is basically about terrorists take over Yakitomi plaza and John McClain has to stop them. Now that sounds simple right? Well looks can be deceiving as there are many twists and turns and it all takes place in this plaza and in a few other places as well. Bruce Willis as John McClain is such a bad-ass in this movie and is easily one of the best action characters ever written. He's funny, vulgar, and overall a real character that you care for. But how can I forget one of the best villains ever in movie history: Hans Gruber. Alan Rickman plays this absolutely entertaining as hell villain and he is very different from other villains as he is very unpredictable and changes his plans when things go wrong and being calm and collect about it. His plans are absolutely deviously clever in this film. I wont go into much detail as it will spoil the movie. Alan Rickman is just so entertaining when hes on screen. Also, the secondary characters were great as well in their roles. Not to mention the cinematography is fantastic and John Mctiernan gets some awesome shots and crazy camera angles that make the film more tension-built and suspenseful but entertaining as well. Overall, this is one of the best action movies ever made by far because of the tension and entertainment value than any other action film. *In Alan Rickman voice* Now go see this movie! Now, now, now!!!

    My statement of Bad-Ass is a small compliment to this awesome action packed film. It is a film that I can safely say will go down in history as one of the greatest action movies of all time. Nearly every action sequence is close to perfection and the storyline is fantastic, I wish could tell you more of the storyline but I do not want to spoil the movie for anyone else. Also the acting by Bruce Willis and Alan Rick man is superb, making the characters come to life. Comparing this to its sequel this movie is a lot more out of line and Bad-Ass. Even if the first Die Hard was the best, the other films in the franchise are also amazingly awesome in a lot of ways. I am glad to have blessed my life with this film and wish for others to do so for their enjoyment and benefit. Yippee-Kai-Yay

    This is like so clich&eacute;d! Mission impossible is getting ripped off by this film, wow that is stealing! And it steals from like EVERY TERRORIST MOVIE EVER. This film should fly into the 911 towers for all i care, i mean it's really bad. the main character looks like donald duck with his face squashed in and i wish he died like REALLY HARD so I wouldn't ever have to see that ugly guy again. you should go watch the grown ups 2 its way better and even if the film was good the cover art is so bad that i give it 1/10, and meen who design that stuff even a six year old like me could design it better! and the director must have been really dumb and immature to make such a bad film, i could do better two. just give me a camera OK and I film good die hard film and everyone loves it BUT THIS IS TERRBLE!!
