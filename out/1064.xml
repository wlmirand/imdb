  A man is murdered, apparently by one of a group of soldiers just out of the army. But which one? And why?
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Homicide Capt. Finlay finds evidence that one or more of a group of demobilized soldiers is involved in the death of Joseph Samuels.

    In the Post WWII, Police Captain Finlay (Robert Young) investigates the murder of the Jewish Joseph "Sammy" Samuels (Sam Levene) in his apartment after a beating with his team. Out of the blue, soldier Montgomery "Monty" (Robert Ryan) comes to the apartment and tells that three soldiers  Corporal Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell (George Cooper), soldier Floyd Bowers (Steve Brodie) and himself  had been in the apartment drinking with Sammy, and Mitch would have been the last one to leave the place. Finlay finds Mitch's wallet on the couch and he becomes the prime suspect. Finlay visits Sergeant Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum) and he tells that his friend Mitch is a sensitive artist incapable to kill a man. Keeley decides to investigate the case to protect and clear the name of his friend. When Keeley discuss the evidences with Finlay, the captain concludes that Mitch did not have the motive to kill Sammy, who was a stranger that he met in a bar. Now Captain Finlay has another suspect and he decides to plot a scheme to expose the assassin. "Crossfire" is a great film-noir, with top-notch director (Edward Dmytryk) and cast with three Roberts - Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan and Robert Young; excellent story of murder and prejudice; magnificent screenplay that uses flashbacks to disclose and solve the mystery; and very impressive quotes. The theme  hatred against Jews  is unusual and this is the first time that I see a film-noir with this type of sordid story (and without the femme fatale). My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Rancor" ("Rancor")

    Many of the characters in "Crossfire" speak in a cadence that creates an almost surreal mood. Sam Levine, Paul Kelly and George Cooper all speak as though they are under the control of the same hypnotist. It could just be that the scriptwriter was unable to develop distinctly different characters, but it works well in this film, giving it a quality that has helped secure its place as a classic of film noir. The movie was based on "The Brick Foxhole", a novel by Richard Brooks. In the book the victim was black, but for various reasons, the murdered man in the film became a Jew, with anti-Semitism as the theme. Although Richard Brooks didn't write the screenplay, he later became a film director. Like John Huston with whom he worked on the script of "The Killers", he was a complete storyteller; he wrote as well as produced and directed. He made some sharp films: "Blackboard Jungle", "Elmer Gantry", "In Cold Blood" and one I like that many don't, "Lord Jim". He was also a tough dude; I once read that he sat Burt Lancaster on his backside after an argument turned physical. The story of "Crossfire", which takes place in New York just after World War Two, begins with the murder of a man, Joseph Samuels played by Sam Levene. A pipe-smoking policeman, Captain Finlay, played by Robert Young, investigates the crime. Young's performance is a precursor to the sage characters he later brought to full flower in television's "Father Knows Best" and "Marcus Welby MD". A number of soldiers were in the murdered man's apartment just prior to his slaying. Robert Ryan gave an acclaimed performance in this film as Montgomery, one of the soldiers in question. Big, sneering and manipulative, he invests the part with a nastiness that is palpable. At first, suspicion falls on another soldier, Mitchell. As part of the investigation, Captain Finlay calls in Sergeant Keeley, Robert Mitchum's character. Keeley tries to protect Mitchell, even arranging for Mitchell's wife to come to town. During a flashback, the film follows Mitchell on the night of the murder where he encounters some unusual characters including Ginny (Gloria Graham), a depressed dancehall "hostess". Eventually, he ends up at Ginny's apartment. Here he encounters a man, listed in the end credits as "The man", played by Paul Kelly; an unusual performance, his character emerges as forlorn, slightly twisted and possibly dangerous  adding another intriguing layer to this unusual story. The film ends abruptly, and conforms to conventions of the period, which allowed no crime to go unpunished. Montgomery is revealed as the murderer and although unarmed, is shot in the back by Captain Finlay in an almost matter-of-fact manner  showing that codes of conduct can change over 60 years. The budget limitations work in the film's favour with much of the story set at night to disguise the studio sets. The end result was a shadowy, claustrophobic world that was perfect for the telling of its taut tale.

    The movie dramatizes an important subject: anti-Semitism. The problem is that it does not generate the outrage and indignation that the subject warrants. This happens partly because the subject is treated in the context of a conventional Hollywood crime drama which further dilutes and distracts attention away from the theme. Furthermore, the principal character, an Army veteran just discharged from the service, is not a completely unsympathetic character; he has legitimate issues too which could be distorting his thoughts. In short, the movie is to be commended for taking on the topic of bigotry but does not go far enough in driving home the subject. Robert Ryan is excellent as the army veteran who is an anti-Semite and the rest of cast is excellent too. Yet the movie does not leave one with a feeling of social injustice. Rather, it leaves one feeling glad that a murderer has been caught but with no resolution of the larger political and social questions which although addressed remain unanswered.

    (Movie quote) - "Hate is like a loaded gun." Released in 1947 - Crossfire stars the 3 "Roberts" - That's Mitchum, Ryan & Young. Crossfire was probably the first Hollywood picture to actually explore racial bigotry - This time in the form of anti-Semitism. Crossfire also addresses post-WW2 issues of soldiers being released from military duty with no other training besides that of being servicemen. Set in Washington, DC - A kindly, soft-spoken man named Joseph Samuels is savagely beaten to death (in his own apartment) by a drunken, recently demobilized American soldier simply because he was Jewish. Due to some incriminating evidence, an innocent soldier is mistakenly blamed for the murder. When this soldier disappears, Detective Finlay, who's investigating the case, must carefully piece together all of the clues to establish the motive behind all of the apparent senselessness. In a series of well-timed flashbacks the whole truth behind the story finally unfolds, escalating to a most brilliant climax. Crossfire is an intelligent, well-crafted film with an excellent script and wonderful performances from a real top-notch cast, especially that of Robert Mitchum as Sargeant Keeley.

    In shadowy Washington, DC, an unidentifiable man beats another man to death, then leaves with his drunken companion. A girlfriend calls pipe-smoking police investigator Robert Young (as Finlay). He begins to question the suspects - a group of discharged military men enjoying relative peace after the end of World War II. First arriving on the scene is Robert Ryan (as "Monty" Montgomery); he expects to find a friend who was with the victim earlier. Next questioned is soldier Robert Mitchum (as Peter Keeley); he tries to steer Mr. Young away from the number one suspect - distraught George Cooper (as Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell)... "Crossfire" has outstanding direction (by Edward Dmytryk), black-and-white photography (by J. Roy Hunt) and performances. RKO and producer Adrian Scott were rewarded with five "Oscar" nominations; probably, Mr. Ryan's startlingly bigoted characterization stood the best chance of winning; he was nominated in the "Supporting Actor" category, but finished as #5 in the "New York Film Critics" contest for leading actor. "Best Picture" consideration was also noted by "Film Daily" (#7 for the year), the "National Board of Review" (#4) and "New York Film Critics" (#3) - remarkable for what was considered a "B" (minor) film... Top-billed Young has one of his best roles and Mr. Cooper's sensitive artist is an amazing film debut. Almost posing as a red herring, Mr. Mitchum is subdued. In smaller roles, browbeaten Steve Brodie (as Floyd Bowers) and "hillbilly" William Phipps (as Leroy) play extraordinarily well against Ryan. Another award nominee, "working girl" Gloria Grahame (as Virginia "Ginny" Tremaine) is great with both Cooper and her dishonorably discharged husband Paul Kelly. Also benefiting from Mr. Dmytryk and the groundbreaking "hate crime" story are victim Sam Levene (Joseph "Sammy" Samuels) and heartbroken Jacqueline White (as Mary). ********* Crossfire (7/22/47) Edward Dmytryk ~ Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Robert Mitchum, George Cooper

    This starts like it always happens, bunch of people in a bar. There is a woman involved. Later in the apartment, the husband turns up dead and the suspect is one of a group of soldiers. I will recommend this to you as an unfairly neglected gem, especially to seasoned noir fans who appreciate how film noir is all about a narrator succumbing to hallucination. Its reputation - tense but obvious - is a little tarnished because the main thrust against racial prejudice is overstated, so it's easy to contend yourself that you know so have the upper hand and nothing beyond the hardboiled mystery is worth paying serious attention to. Not so, not so by a mile my friends. The Jewish angle was introduced to make this pose as a serious postwar lesson, you will know it is plain tacky from how quickly the police captain can suss it out as the root of evil. And nothing more patronizing than the captain lecturing about it a young hick from Tennessee, playing up the same stereotype it warns against. You may appreciate this a little more, anyway, when you learn that it was changed from homosexuality in the originating text. Traces are cleverly preserved in the film so be on the lookout. So the bulk of the film is male hierarchy between soldiers, so people in transit, inbetween lives, inbetween shifting of identities. One of them used to be a cop in that other life, another an artist so a sensitive man. Now they're all in the same uniform stationed in the same limbo and all sorts of wounds from the war have not healed. So here's a film that, already by '47, can elucidate what noir is all about and why it feels the way it does; it's about men returned from the certainty of killing, chaos that was nevertheless safety because ordered from above, to open life where you, it had to be you now, had to be someone again and responsible for your own story. So it was a stressful thing, because it could turn out that you are no one at all and have no story, hence the dissolution of self so common in noir, hence the hallucinations, the world conspiring against you, the feeling of dazed powerlessness disguised as fate from above. One option you have is to read everything with repressed male sexuality in mind, that is fine, Beau Travail. But let me point you at something else, what I call layered dreaming. Our artist was out at night dreaming but has no recollection what about, except it started with stress and thinking about his wife that he misses. Mitchum smoothly talks him into all gradually coming back to him, and sure enough; he was with this other woman, and sure enough a woman that reminds him of his wife, and wants him home to wait for her. But something weird happens there. He has fallen asleep and wakes up to find a second man, a really puzzling figure. This guy is the key to the whole mystery. He holds together several layers, by shifting stories that shift identities that shift the gears of knowing and dreaming what this is all about. He says he's just a man waiting for her. He is the husband back home, to a wife he enlisted and couldn't wait to get back to, but once he did she didn't want him. He's not the husband, and just met her at the same joint. He wants to marry her but she won't have him. That's a lie too. If you have no imagination, and why would you dream about him if you don't, he's just the pimp a little wobbly from the war himself. Boring. You will know him as our guy, remember he is telling the story and the story is about waking up, so our guy hallucinating different selves and each self has a life out there and comes back home, maybe an empty home, maybe waiting for a woman who is not there, maybe she could be the wife, maybe it isn't even a home, at any rate it is him in that place he comes back to at nights and mutters to himself echoes from that maybe-life out there. If I had to pick a single favorite moment in film noir, this would be it. Not even Welles touches it. As a metaphor about the mind, it's worthy of being in Blowup.

    Edward Dmytryk was one of the most reliable of workman-like directors working in Hollywood from the 1940s to the 1960s. He was responsible for classics like FAREWELL MY LOVELY, THE DEVIL COMMANDS and THE CAINE MUTINY. CROSSFIRE isn't the best film on the Dmytryk CV, but even a so-so Dmytryk movie is better than most other directors' on their good days. The plot revolves around a group of men recently released from war-service in the US Army, so recently that some of them still wear their uniforms. After an afternoon's hard drinking, a man the soldiers meet in a bar is murdered. It looks like one of the soldiers, Mitch Mitchell (George Cooper), did it, but the police flounder when it comes to finding a motive. The soldier's sergeant, Keeley (Robert Mitchum) is convinced the suspect didn't do the crime and sets out to uncover the true killer himself. The always-terrific Gloria Grahame plays an embittered bar hostess who might be able to give Mitch the nearest thing to an alibi he's going to get. Not sure I like Gloria as a bleached blonde, but the look suits her character exactly. Mitchum's performance is even more laid-back than usual and you get the feeling he thinks he's slumming it in this low-budget picture. But his presence still contributes some gravitas and focus to the story. The fact is that it's not much of a mystery. You'll probably figure out who the killer is first time you lay eyes on him, but even so, I enjoyed watching the plot unfold and seeing how men who fought together show such loyalty to one another despite having little else in common. I'd quite happily sit through this again ...

    Before, during and after every war, we confront the men who have done most of the fighting for us. What they fight for and what we believe they fought for are often two different things. In this movie directed by Edward Dmytryk and written by Richard Brooks is entitled " Crossfire " we see one of the finest actors playing a character he so often detested himself. Robert Ryan plays a hate filled soldier named Montgomery, who with sundry other WWII soldiers just discharged from the service, gather in a hotel to have some fun and enjoy a few drinks. What they didn't count on is, that somewhere in the night hours, playtime becomes a bit rough and a civilian named Samuels (Sam Levene) is killed. Now it's up to Capt. Finlay (Robert Young) and the police to discover who and why the man was murdered. Among the prime suspects is Sargant Keeley (Robert Mitchum) a platoon Sgt. who wants very much to help apprehend the guilty soldier. The Black and White film is filled with black shadows, dark motives and should have garnered several awards for it's effort to expose Bigotry, racism and anti-Semitism. But we can readily understand the reasons when we become aware of the Red Scare during the 1940-50's. Ryan is at his very best in the film as is Mitchum. Excellent tour De force. ****

    As an Army sergeant just released from duty, Robert Ryan creates a scary, thoroughly thought-out characterization, that of a man who has seen battle and killing but is now set free on the streets of America--with no agenda and nowhere to channel his pent-up rage. This "important picture", adapted from Richard Brooks' novel, deals with the police investigation into the beating death of a Jewish civilian, with soldiers as their suspects, yet Ryan's three-dimensional portrait of a man on the edge elevates the material beyond the crime genre. While sorting out the different scenarios which led to the innocent man's death, police captain Robert Young keeps a subdued, beleaguered head, which allows Ryan the room to go into his nervy Jekyll-and-Hyde arias. There isn't much suspense or surprise in the story, and one can't tell for sure if any was intended; Edward Dmytryk has directed the film in a brutal and straightforward fashion. The original theme of Brooks' story was homophobia but, that being deemed too controversial for 1947, it was changed to anti-Semitism; the irony, of course, was that Dmytryk caught the attention of the House Un-American Activities Committee on the basis of this plot-point and was subsequently investigated (later serving jail-time for refusing to cooperate). **1/2 from ****

    Once thematically edgy, now thoroughly banal, director Edward Dmytryk's "Crossfire" relies heavily on its message against anti-Semitism to distinguish it from similar B movie noirs of the 1940s. Taking place in post-WW2 America, the film revolves around an incident in which a group of angry soldiers go out for a night on the town and somehow manage to kill a Jewish man. Confronted by the law, one bigoted soldier shifts the blame to another who, because he has no recollection of the night in question, is unable to shake off the accusations. Trying to make sense of this ordeal are actors Robert Mitchum (who starred in the 1947 noir masterpiece "Out of the Past", released the same year as "Crossfire") and Robert Young, both of whom are investigators. Like many noirs, the film relies heavily on flashbacks, which are used to flesh out the motivations of the film's cast. Themes of racial and social intolerance are brought up, but the film is overly elaborative, our hands held at every turn. By the film's end we feel like we've watched a condescending Stanley Kramer message movie, rather than a genuinely atmospheric noir. 6/10  Condescending and preachy, despite its worthy message. Watch the excellent "Out of the Past" instead.

Another award nominee, "working girl" Gloria Grahame (as Virginia "Ginny" Tremaine) is great with both Cooper and her dishonorably discharged husband Paul Kelly. Also benefiting from Mr. Dmytryk and the groundbreaking "hate crime" story are victim Sam Levene (Joseph "Sammy" Samuels) and heartbroken Jacqueline White (as Mary). ********* Crossfire (7/22/47) Edward Dmytryk ~ Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Robert Mitchum, George Cooper

    This starts like it always happens, bunch of people in a bar. There is a woman involved. Later in the apartment, the husband turns up dead and the suspect is one of a group of soldiers. I will recommend this to you as an unfairly neglected gem, especially to seasoned noir fans who appreciate how film noir is all about a narrator succumbing to hallucination. Its reputation - tense but obvious - is a little tarnished because the main thrust against racial prejudice is overstated, so it's easy to contend yourself that you know so have the upper hand and nothing beyond the hardboiled mystery is worth paying serious attention to. Not so, not so by a mile my friends. The Jewish angle was introduced to make this pose as a serious postwar lesson, you will know it is plain tacky from how quickly the police captain can suss it out as the root of evil. And nothing more patronizing than the captain lecturing about it a young hick from Tennessee, playing up the same stereotype it warns against. You may appreciate this a little more, anyway, when you learn that it was changed from homosexuality in the originating text. Traces are cleverly preserved in the film so be on the lookout. So the bulk of the film is male hierarchy between soldiers, so people in transit, inbetween lives, inbetween shifting of identities. One of them used to be a cop in that other life, another an artist so a sensitive man. Now they're all in the same uniform stationed in the same limbo and all sorts of wounds from the war have not healed. So here's a film that, already by '47, can elucidate what noir is all about and why it feels the way it does; it's about men returned from the certainty of killing, chaos that was nevertheless safety because ordered from above, to open life where you, it had to be you now, had to be someone again and responsible for your own story. So it was a stressful thing, because it could turn out that you are no one at all and have no story, hence the dissolution of self so common in noir, hence the hallucinations, the world conspiring against you, the feeling of dazed powerlessness disguised as fate from above. One option you have is to read everything with repressed male sexuality in mind, that is fine, Beau Travail. But let me point you at something else, what I call layered dreaming. Our artist was out at night dreaming but has no recollection what about, except it started with stress and thinking about his wife that he misses. Mitchum smoothly talks him into all gradually coming back to him, and sure enough; he was with this other woman, and sure enough a woman that reminds him of his wife, and wants him home to wait for her. But something weird happens there. He has fallen asleep and wakes up to find a second man, a really puzzling figure. This guy is the key to the whole mystery. He holds together several layers, by shifting stories that shift identities that shift the gears of knowing and dreaming what this is all about. He says he's just a man waiting for her. He is the husband back home, to a wife he enlisted and couldn't wait to get back to, but once he did she didn't want him. He's not the husband, and just met her at the same joint. He wants to marry her but she won't have him. That's a lie too. If you have no imagination, and why would you dream about him if you don't, he's just the pimp a little wobbly from the war himself. Boring. You will know him as our guy, remember he is telling the story and the story is about waking up, so our guy hallucinating different selves and each self has a life out there and comes back home, maybe an empty home, maybe waiting for a woman who is not there, maybe she could be the wife, maybe it isn't even a home, at any rate it is him in that place he comes back to at nights and mutters to himself echoes from that maybe-life out there. If I had to pick a single favorite moment in film noir, this would be it. Not even Welles touches it. As a metaphor about the mind, it's worthy of being in Blowup.

    Edward Dmytryk was one of the most reliable of workman-like directors working in Hollywood from the 1940s to the 1960s. He was responsible for classics like FAREWELL MY LOVELY, THE DEVIL COMMANDS and THE CAINE MUTINY. CROSSFIRE isn't the best film on the Dmytryk CV, but even a so-so Dmytryk movie is better than most other directors' on their good days. The plot revolves around a group of men recently released from war-service in the US Army, so recently that some of them still wear their uniforms. After an afternoon's hard drinking, a man the soldiers meet in a bar is murdered. It looks like one of the soldiers, Mitch Mitchell (George Cooper), did it, but the police flounder when it comes to finding a motive. The soldier's sergeant, Keeley (Robert Mitchum) is convinced the suspect didn't do the crime and sets out to uncover the true killer himself. The always-terrific Gloria Grahame plays an embittered bar hostess who might be able to give Mitch the nearest thing to an alibi he's going to get. Not sure I like Gloria as a bleached blonde, but the look suits her character exactly. Mitchum's performance is even more laid-back than usual and you get the feeling he thinks he's slumming it in this low-budget picture. But his presence still contributes some gravitas and focus to the story. The fact is that it's not much of a mystery. You'll probably figure out who the killer is first time you lay eyes on him, but even so, I enjoyed watching the plot unfold and seeing how men who fought together show such loyalty to one another despite having little else in common. I'd quite happily sit through this again ...

    Before, during and after every war, we confront the men who have done most of the fighting for us. What they fight for and what we believe they fought for are often two different things. In this movie directed by Edward Dmytryk and written by Richard Brooks is entitled " Crossfire " we see one of the finest actors playing a character he so often detested himself. Robert Ryan plays a hate filled soldier named Montgomery, who with sundry other WWII soldiers just discharged from the service, gather in a hotel to have some fun and enjoy a few drinks. What they didn't count on is, that somewhere in the night hours, playtime becomes a bit rough and a civilian named Samuels (Sam Levene) is killed. Now it's up to Capt. Finlay (Robert Young) and the police to discover who and why the man was murdered. Among the prime suspects is Sargant Keeley (Robert Mitchum) a platoon Sgt. who wants very much to help apprehend the guilty soldier. The Black and White film is filled with black shadows, dark motives and should have garnered several awards for it's effort to expose Bigotry, racism and anti-Semitism. But we can readily understand the reasons when we become aware of the Red Scare during the 1940-50's. Ryan is at his very best in the film as is Mitchum. Excellent tour De force. ****

    As an Army sergeant just released from duty, Robert Ryan creates a scary, thoroughly thought-out characterization, that of a man who has seen battle and killing but is now set free on the streets of America--with no agenda and nowhere to channel his pent-up rage. This "important picture", adapted from Richard Brooks' novel, deals with the police investigation into the beating death of a Jewish civilian, with soldiers as their suspects, yet Ryan's three-dimensional portrait of a man on the edge elevates the material beyond the crime genre. While sorting out the different scenarios which led to the innocent man's death, police captain Robert Young keeps a subdued, beleaguered head, which allows Ryan the room to go into his nervy Jekyll-and-Hyde arias. There isn't much suspense or surprise in the story, and one can't tell for sure if any was intended; Edward Dmytryk has directed the film in a brutal and straightforward fashion. The original theme of Brooks' story was homophobia but, that being deemed too controversial for 1947, it was changed to anti-Semitism; the irony, of course, was that Dmytryk caught the attention of the House Un-American Activities Committee on the basis of this plot-point and was subsequently investigated (later serving jail-time for refusing to cooperate). **1/2 from ****

    Once thematically edgy, now thoroughly banal, director Edward Dmytryk's "Crossfire" relies heavily on its message against anti-Semitism to distinguish it from similar B movie noirs of the 1940s. Taking place in post-WW2 America, the film revolves around an incident in which a group of angry soldiers go out for a night on the town and somehow manage to kill a Jewish man. Confronted by the law, one bigoted soldier shifts the blame to another who, because he has no recollection of the night in question, is unable to shake off the accusations. Trying to make sense of this ordeal are actors Robert Mitchum (who starred in the 1947 noir masterpiece "Out of the Past", released the same year as "Crossfire") and Robert Young, both of whom are investigators. Like many noirs, the film relies heavily on flashbacks, which are used to flesh out the motivations of the film's cast. Themes of racial and social intolerance are brought up, but the film is overly elaborative, our hands held at every turn. By the film's end we feel like we've watched a condescending Stanley Kramer message movie, rather than a genuinely atmospheric noir. 6/10  Condescending and preachy, despite its worthy message. Watch the excellent "Out of the Past" instead.

    In the Post WWII, Police Captain Finlay (Robert Young) investigates the murder of the Jewish Joseph "Sammy" Samuels (Sam Levene) in his apartment after a beating with his team. Out of the blue, soldier Montgomery "Monty" (Robert Ryan) comes to the apartment and tells that three soldiers  Corporal Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell (George Cooper), soldier Floyd Bowers (Steve Brodie) and himself  had been in the apartment drinking with Sammy, and Mitch would have been the last one to leave the place. Finlay finds Mitch's wallet on the couch and he becomes the prime suspect. Finlay visits Sergeant Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum) and he tells that his friend Mitch is a sensitive artist incapable to kill a man. Keeley decides to investigate the case to protect and clear the name of his friend. When Keeley discuss the evidences with Finlay, the captain concludes that Mitch did not have the motive to kill Sammy, who was a stranger that he met in a bar. Now Captain Finlay has another suspect and he decides to plot a scheme to expose the assassin. "Crossfire" is a great film-noir, with top-notch director (Edward Dmytryk) and cast with three Roberts - Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan and Robert Young; excellent story of murder and prejudice; magnificent screenplay that uses flashbacks to disclose and solve the mystery; and very impressive quotes. The theme  hatred against Jews  is unusual and this is the first time that I see a film-noir with this type of sordid story (and without the femme fatale). My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Rancor" ("Rancor")

    Many of the characters in "Crossfire" speak in a cadence that creates an almost surreal mood. Sam Levine, Paul Kelly and George Cooper all speak as though they are under the control of the same hypnotist. It could just be that the scriptwriter was unable to develop distinctly different characters, but it works well in this film, giving it a quality that has helped secure its place as a classic of film noir. The movie was based on "The Brick Foxhole", a novel by Richard Brooks. In the book the victim was black, but for various reasons, the murdered man in the film became a Jew, with anti-Semitism as the theme. Although Richard Brooks didn't write the screenplay, he later became a film director. Like John Huston with whom he worked on the script of "The Killers", he was a complete storyteller; he wrote as well as produced and directed. He made some sharp films: "Blackboard Jungle", "Elmer Gantry", "In Cold Blood" and one I like that many don't, "Lord Jim". He was also a tough dude; I once read that he sat Burt Lancaster on his backside after an argument turned physical. The story of "Crossfire", which takes place in New York just after World War Two, begins with the murder of a man, Joseph Samuels played by Sam Levene. A pipe-smoking policeman, Captain Finlay, played by Robert Young, investigates the crime. Young's performance is a precursor to the sage characters he later brought to full flower in television's "Father Knows Best" and "Marcus Welby MD". A number of soldiers were in the murdered man's apartment just prior to his slaying. Robert Ryan gave an acclaimed performance in this film as Montgomery, one of the soldiers in question. Big, sneering and manipulative, he invests the part with a nastiness that is palpable. At first, suspicion falls on another soldier, Mitchell. As part of the investigation, Captain Finlay calls in Sergeant Keeley, Robert Mitchum's character. Keeley tries to protect Mitchell, even arranging for Mitchell's wife to come to town. During a flashback, the film follows Mitchell on the night of the murder where he encounters some unusual characters including Ginny (Gloria Graham), a depressed dancehall "hostess". Eventually, he ends up at Ginny's apartment. Here he encounters a man, listed in the end credits as "The man", played by Paul Kelly; an unusual performance, his character emerges as forlorn, slightly twisted and possibly dangerous  adding another intriguing layer to this unusual story. The film ends abruptly, and conforms to conventions of the period, which allowed no crime to go unpunished. Montgomery is revealed as the murderer and although unarmed, is shot in the back by Captain Finlay in an almost matter-of-fact manner  showing that codes of conduct can change over 60 years. The budget limitations work in the film's favour with much of the story set at night to disguise the studio sets. The end result was a shadowy, claustrophobic world that was perfect for the telling of its taut tale.

    The movie dramatizes an important subject: anti-Semitism. The problem is that it does not generate the outrage and indignation that the subject warrants. This happens partly because the subject is treated in the context of a conventional Hollywood crime drama which further dilutes and distracts attention away from the theme. Furthermore, the principal character, an Army veteran just discharged from the service, is not a completely unsympathetic character; he has legitimate issues too which could be distorting his thoughts. In short, the movie is to be commended for taking on the topic of bigotry but does not go far enough in driving home the subject. Robert Ryan is excellent as the army veteran who is an anti-Semite and the rest of cast is excellent too. Yet the movie does not leave one with a feeling of social injustice. Rather, it leaves one feeling glad that a murderer has been caught but with no resolution of the larger political and social questions which although addressed remain unanswered.

    (Movie quote) - "Hate is like a loaded gun." Released in 1947 - Crossfire stars the 3 "Roberts" - That's Mitchum, Ryan & Young. Crossfire was probably the first Hollywood picture to actually explore racial bigotry - This time in the form of anti-Semitism. Crossfire also addresses post-WW2 issues of soldiers being released from military duty with no other training besides that of being servicemen. Set in Washington, DC - A kindly, soft-spoken man named Joseph Samuels is savagely beaten to death (in his own apartment) by a drunken, recently demobilized American soldier simply because he was Jewish. Due to some incriminating evidence, an innocent soldier is mistakenly blamed for the murder. When this soldier disappears, Detective Finlay, who's investigating the case, must carefully piece together all of the clues to establish the motive behind all of the apparent senselessness. In a series of well-timed flashbacks the whole truth behind the story finally unfolds, escalating to a most brilliant climax. Crossfire is an intelligent, well-crafted film with an excellent script and wonderful performances from a real top-notch cast, especially that of Robert Mitchum as Sargeant Keeley.

    In shadowy Washington, DC, an unidentifiable man beats another man to death, then leaves with his drunken companion. A girlfriend calls pipe-smoking police investigator Robert Young (as Finlay). He begins to question the suspects - a group of discharged military men enjoying relative peace after the end of World War II. First arriving on the scene is Robert Ryan (as "Monty" Montgomery); he expects to find a friend who was with the victim earlier. Next questioned is soldier Robert Mitchum (as Peter Keeley); he tries to steer Mr. Young away from the number one suspect - distraught George Cooper (as Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell)... "Crossfire" has outstanding direction (by Edward Dmytryk), black-and-white photography (by J. Roy Hunt) and performances. RKO and producer Adrian Scott were rewarded with five "Oscar" nominations; probably, Mr. Ryan's startlingly bigoted characterization stood the best chance of winning; he was nominated in the "Supporting Actor" category, but finished as #5 in the "New York Film Critics" contest for leading actor. "Best Picture" consideration was also noted by "Film Daily" (#7 for the year), the "National Board of Review" (#4) and "New York Film Critics" (#3) - remarkable for what was considered a "B" (minor) film... Top-billed Young has one of his best roles and Mr. Cooper's sensitive artist is an amazing film debut. Almost posing as a red herring, Mr. Mitchum is subdued. In smaller roles, browbeaten Steve Brodie (as Floyd Bowers) and "hillbilly" William Phipps (as Leroy) play extraordinarily well against Ryan. Another award nominee, "working girl" Gloria Grahame (as Virginia "Ginny" Tremaine) is great with both Cooper and her dishonorably discharged husband Paul Kelly. Also benefiting from Mr. Dmytryk and the groundbreaking "hate crime" story are victim Sam Levene (Joseph "Sammy" Samuels) and heartbroken Jacqueline White (as Mary). ********* Crossfire (7/22/47) Edward Dmytryk ~ Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Robert Mitchum, George Cooper

Watch the excellent "Out of the Past" instead.

    In the Post WWII, Police Captain Finlay (Robert Young) investigates the murder of the Jewish Joseph "Sammy" Samuels (Sam Levene) in his apartment after a beating with his team. Out of the blue, soldier Montgomery "Monty" (Robert Ryan) comes to the apartment and tells that three soldiers  Corporal Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell (George Cooper), soldier Floyd Bowers (Steve Brodie) and himself  had been in the apartment drinking with Sammy, and Mitch would have been the last one to leave the place. Finlay finds Mitch's wallet on the couch and he becomes the prime suspect. Finlay visits Sergeant Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum) and he tells that his friend Mitch is a sensitive artist incapable to kill a man. Keeley decides to investigate the case to protect and clear the name of his friend. When Keeley discuss the evidences with Finlay, the captain concludes that Mitch did not have the motive to kill Sammy, who was a stranger that he met in a bar. Now Captain Finlay has another suspect and he decides to plot a scheme to expose the assassin. "Crossfire" is a great film-noir, with top-notch director (Edward Dmytryk) and cast with three Roberts - Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan and Robert Young; excellent story of murder and prejudice; magnificent screenplay that uses flashbacks to disclose and solve the mystery; and very impressive quotes. The theme  hatred against Jews  is unusual and this is the first time that I see a film-noir with this type of sordid story (and without the femme fatale). My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Rancor" ("Rancor")

    Many of the characters in "Crossfire" speak in a cadence that creates an almost surreal mood. Sam Levine, Paul Kelly and George Cooper all speak as though they are under the control of the same hypnotist. It could just be that the scriptwriter was unable to develop distinctly different characters, but it works well in this film, giving it a quality that has helped secure its place as a classic of film noir. The movie was based on "The Brick Foxhole", a novel by Richard Brooks. In the book the victim was black, but for various reasons, the murdered man in the film became a Jew, with anti-Semitism as the theme. Although Richard Brooks didn't write the screenplay, he later became a film director. Like John Huston with whom he worked on the script of "The Killers", he was a complete storyteller; he wrote as well as produced and directed. He made some sharp films: "Blackboard Jungle", "Elmer Gantry", "In Cold Blood" and one I like that many don't, "Lord Jim". He was also a tough dude; I once read that he sat Burt Lancaster on his backside after an argument turned physical. The story of "Crossfire", which takes place in New York just after World War Two, begins with the murder of a man, Joseph Samuels played by Sam Levene. A pipe-smoking policeman, Captain Finlay, played by Robert Young, investigates the crime. Young's performance is a precursor to the sage characters he later brought to full flower in television's "Father Knows Best" and "Marcus Welby MD". A number of soldiers were in the murdered man's apartment just prior to his slaying. Robert Ryan gave an acclaimed performance in this film as Montgomery, one of the soldiers in question. Big, sneering and manipulative, he invests the part with a nastiness that is palpable. At first, suspicion falls on another soldier, Mitchell. As part of the investigation, Captain Finlay calls in Sergeant Keeley, Robert Mitchum's character. Keeley tries to protect Mitchell, even arranging for Mitchell's wife to come to town. During a flashback, the film follows Mitchell on the night of the murder where he encounters some unusual characters including Ginny (Gloria Graham), a depressed dancehall "hostess". Eventually, he ends up at Ginny's apartment. Here he encounters a man, listed in the end credits as "The man", played by Paul Kelly; an unusual performance, his character emerges as forlorn, slightly twisted and possibly dangerous  adding another intriguing layer to this unusual story. The film ends abruptly, and conforms to conventions of the period, which allowed no crime to go unpunished. Montgomery is revealed as the murderer and although unarmed, is shot in the back by Captain Finlay in an almost matter-of-fact manner  showing that codes of conduct can change over 60 years. The budget limitations work in the film's favour with much of the story set at night to disguise the studio sets. The end result was a shadowy, claustrophobic world that was perfect for the telling of its taut tale.

    The movie dramatizes an important subject: anti-Semitism. The problem is that it does not generate the outrage and indignation that the subject warrants. This happens partly because the subject is treated in the context of a conventional Hollywood crime drama which further dilutes and distracts attention away from the theme. Furthermore, the principal character, an Army veteran just discharged from the service, is not a completely unsympathetic character; he has legitimate issues too which could be distorting his thoughts. In short, the movie is to be commended for taking on the topic of bigotry but does not go far enough in driving home the subject. Robert Ryan is excellent as the army veteran who is an anti-Semite and the rest of cast is excellent too. Yet the movie does not leave one with a feeling of social injustice. Rather, it leaves one feeling glad that a murderer has been caught but with no resolution of the larger political and social questions which although addressed remain unanswered.

    (Movie quote) - "Hate is like a loaded gun." Released in 1947 - Crossfire stars the 3 "Roberts" - That's Mitchum, Ryan & Young. Crossfire was probably the first Hollywood picture to actually explore racial bigotry - This time in the form of anti-Semitism. Crossfire also addresses post-WW2 issues of soldiers being released from military duty with no other training besides that of being servicemen. Set in Washington, DC - A kindly, soft-spoken man named Joseph Samuels is savagely beaten to death (in his own apartment) by a drunken, recently demobilized American soldier simply because he was Jewish. Due to some incriminating evidence, an innocent soldier is mistakenly blamed for the murder. When this soldier disappears, Detective Finlay, who's investigating the case, must carefully piece together all of the clues to establish the motive behind all of the apparent senselessness. In a series of well-timed flashbacks the whole truth behind the story finally unfolds, escalating to a most brilliant climax. Crossfire is an intelligent, well-crafted film with an excellent script and wonderful performances from a real top-notch cast, especially that of Robert Mitchum as Sargeant Keeley.

    In shadowy Washington, DC, an unidentifiable man beats another man to death, then leaves with his drunken companion. A girlfriend calls pipe-smoking police investigator Robert Young (as Finlay). He begins to question the suspects - a group of discharged military men enjoying relative peace after the end of World War II. First arriving on the scene is Robert Ryan (as "Monty" Montgomery); he expects to find a friend who was with the victim earlier. Next questioned is soldier Robert Mitchum (as Peter Keeley); he tries to steer Mr. Young away from the number one suspect - distraught George Cooper (as Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell)... "Crossfire" has outstanding direction (by Edward Dmytryk), black-and-white photography (by J. Roy Hunt) and performances. RKO and producer Adrian Scott were rewarded with five "Oscar" nominations; probably, Mr. Ryan's startlingly bigoted characterization stood the best chance of winning; he was nominated in the "Supporting Actor" category, but finished as #5 in the "New York Film Critics" contest for leading actor. "Best Picture" consideration was also noted by "Film Daily" (#7 for the year), the "National Board of Review" (#4) and "New York Film Critics" (#3) - remarkable for what was considered a "B" (minor) film... Top-billed Young has one of his best roles and Mr. Cooper's sensitive artist is an amazing film debut. Almost posing as a red herring, Mr. Mitchum is subdued. In smaller roles, browbeaten Steve Brodie (as Floyd Bowers) and "hillbilly" William Phipps (as Leroy) play extraordinarily well against Ryan. Another award nominee, "working girl" Gloria Grahame (as Virginia "Ginny" Tremaine) is great with both Cooper and her dishonorably discharged husband Paul Kelly. Also benefiting from Mr. Dmytryk and the groundbreaking "hate crime" story are victim Sam Levene (Joseph "Sammy" Samuels) and heartbroken Jacqueline White (as Mary). ********* Crossfire (7/22/47) Edward Dmytryk ~ Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Robert Mitchum, George Cooper

    This starts like it always happens, bunch of people in a bar. There is a woman involved. Later in the apartment, the husband turns up dead and the suspect is one of a group of soldiers. I will recommend this to you as an unfairly neglected gem, especially to seasoned noir fans who appreciate how film noir is all about a narrator succumbing to hallucination. Its reputation - tense but obvious - is a little tarnished because the main thrust against racial prejudice is overstated, so it's easy to contend yourself that you know so have the upper hand and nothing beyond the hardboiled mystery is worth paying serious attention to. Not so, not so by a mile my friends. The Jewish angle was introduced to make this pose as a serious postwar lesson, you will know it is plain tacky from how quickly the police captain can suss it out as the root of evil. And nothing more patronizing than the captain lecturing about it a young hick from Tennessee, playing up the same stereotype it warns against. You may appreciate this a little more, anyway, when you learn that it was changed from homosexuality in the originating text. Traces are cleverly preserved in the film so be on the lookout. So the bulk of the film is male hierarchy between soldiers, so people in transit, inbetween lives, inbetween shifting of identities. One of them used to be a cop in that other life, another an artist so a sensitive man. Now they're all in the same uniform stationed in the same limbo and all sorts of wounds from the war have not healed. So here's a film that, already by '47, can elucidate what noir is all about and why it feels the way it does; it's about men returned from the certainty of killing, chaos that was nevertheless safety because ordered from above, to open life where you, it had to be you now, had to be someone again and responsible for your own story. So it was a stressful thing, because it could turn out that you are no one at all and have no story, hence the dissolution of self so common in noir, hence the hallucinations, the world conspiring against you, the feeling of dazed powerlessness disguised as fate from above. One option you have is to read everything with repressed male sexuality in mind, that is fine, Beau Travail. But let me point you at something else, what I call layered dreaming. Our artist was out at night dreaming but has no recollection what about, except it started with stress and thinking about his wife that he misses. Mitchum smoothly talks him into all gradually coming back to him, and sure enough; he was with this other woman, and sure enough a woman that reminds him of his wife, and wants him home to wait for her. But something weird happens there. He has fallen asleep and wakes up to find a second man, a really puzzling figure. This guy is the key to the whole mystery. He holds together several layers, by shifting stories that shift identities that shift the gears of knowing and dreaming what this is all about. He says he's just a man waiting for her. He is the husband back home, to a wife he enlisted and couldn't wait to get back to, but once he did she didn't want him. He's not the husband, and just met her at the same joint. He wants to marry her but she won't have him. That's a lie too. If you have no imagination, and why would you dream about him if you don't, he's just the pimp a little wobbly from the war himself. Boring. You will know him as our guy, remember he is telling the story and the story is about waking up, so our guy hallucinating different selves and each self has a life out there and comes back home, maybe an empty home, maybe waiting for a woman who is not there, maybe she could be the wife, maybe it isn't even a home, at any rate it is him in that place he comes back to at nights and mutters to himself echoes from that maybe-life out there. If I had to pick a single favorite moment in film noir, this would be it. Not even Welles touches it. As a metaphor about the mind, it's worthy of being in Blowup.

    Edward Dmytryk was one of the most reliable of workman-like directors working in Hollywood from the 1940s to the 1960s. He was responsible for classics like FAREWELL MY LOVELY, THE DEVIL COMMANDS and THE CAINE MUTINY. CROSSFIRE isn't the best film on the Dmytryk CV, but even a so-so Dmytryk movie is better than most other directors' on their good days. The plot revolves around a group of men recently released from war-service in the US Army, so recently that some of them still wear their uniforms. After an afternoon's hard drinking, a man the soldiers meet in a bar is murdered. It looks like one of the soldiers, Mitch Mitchell (George Cooper), did it, but the police flounder when it comes to finding a motive. The soldier's sergeant, Keeley (Robert Mitchum) is convinced the suspect didn't do the crime and sets out to uncover the true killer himself. The always-terrific Gloria Grahame plays an embittered bar hostess who might be able to give Mitch the nearest thing to an alibi he's going to get. Not sure I like Gloria as a bleached blonde, but the look suits her character exactly. Mitchum's performance is even more laid-back than usual and you get the feeling he thinks he's slumming it in this low-budget picture. But his presence still contributes some gravitas and focus to the story. The fact is that it's not much of a mystery. You'll probably figure out who the killer is first time you lay eyes on him, but even so, I enjoyed watching the plot unfold and seeing how men who fought together show such loyalty to one another despite having little else in common. I'd quite happily sit through this again ...

    Before, during and after every war, we confront the men who have done most of the fighting for us. What they fight for and what we believe they fought for are often two different things. In this movie directed by Edward Dmytryk and written by Richard Brooks is entitled " Crossfire " we see one of the finest actors playing a character he so often detested himself. Robert Ryan plays a hate filled soldier named Montgomery, who with sundry other WWII soldiers just discharged from the service, gather in a hotel to have some fun and enjoy a few drinks. What they didn't count on is, that somewhere in the night hours, playtime becomes a bit rough and a civilian named Samuels (Sam Levene) is killed. Now it's up to Capt. Finlay (Robert Young) and the police to discover who and why the man was murdered. Among the prime suspects is Sargant Keeley (Robert Mitchum) a platoon Sgt. who wants very much to help apprehend the guilty soldier. The Black and White film is filled with black shadows, dark motives and should have garnered several awards for it's effort to expose Bigotry, racism and anti-Semitism. But we can readily understand the reasons when we become aware of the Red Scare during the 1940-50's. Ryan is at his very best in the film as is Mitchum. Excellent tour De force. ****

    As an Army sergeant just released from duty, Robert Ryan creates a scary, thoroughly thought-out characterization, that of a man who has seen battle and killing but is now set free on the streets of America--with no agenda and nowhere to channel his pent-up rage. This "important picture", adapted from Richard Brooks' novel, deals with the police investigation into the beating death of a Jewish civilian, with soldiers as their suspects, yet Ryan's three-dimensional portrait of a man on the edge elevates the material beyond the crime genre. While sorting out the different scenarios which led to the innocent man's death, police captain Robert Young keeps a subdued, beleaguered head, which allows Ryan the room to go into his nervy Jekyll-and-Hyde arias. There isn't much suspense or surprise in the story, and one can't tell for sure if any was intended; Edward Dmytryk has directed the film in a brutal and straightforward fashion. The original theme of Brooks' story was homophobia but, that being deemed too controversial for 1947, it was changed to anti-Semitism; the irony, of course, was that Dmytryk caught the attention of the House Un-American Activities Committee on the basis of this plot-point and was subsequently investigated (later serving jail-time for refusing to cooperate). **1/2 from ****

    Once thematically edgy, now thoroughly banal, director Edward Dmytryk's "Crossfire" relies heavily on its message against anti-Semitism to distinguish it from similar B movie noirs of the 1940s. Taking place in post-WW2 America, the film revolves around an incident in which a group of angry soldiers go out for a night on the town and somehow manage to kill a Jewish man. Confronted by the law, one bigoted soldier shifts the blame to another who, because he has no recollection of the night in question, is unable to shake off the accusations. Trying to make sense of this ordeal are actors Robert Mitchum (who starred in the 1947 noir masterpiece "Out of the Past", released the same year as "Crossfire") and Robert Young, both of whom are investigators. Like many noirs, the film relies heavily on flashbacks, which are used to flesh out the motivations of the film's cast. Themes of racial and social intolerance are brought up, but the film is overly elaborative, our hands held at every turn. By the film's end we feel like we've watched a condescending Stanley Kramer message movie, rather than a genuinely atmospheric noir. 6/10  Condescending and preachy, despite its worthy message. Watch the excellent "Out of the Past" instead.

So the bulk of the film is male hierarchy between soldiers, so people in transit, inbetween lives, inbetween shifting of identities. One of them used to be a cop in that other life, another an artist so a sensitive man. Now they're all in the same uniform stationed in the same limbo and all sorts of wounds from the war have not healed. So here's a film that, already by '47, can elucidate what noir is all about and why it feels the way it does; it's about men returned from the certainty of killing, chaos that was nevertheless safety because ordered from above, to open life where you, it had to be you now, had to be someone again and responsible for your own story. So it was a stressful thing, because it could turn out that you are no one at all and have no story, hence the dissolution of self so common in noir, hence the hallucinations, the world conspiring against you, the feeling of dazed powerlessness disguised as fate from above. One option you have is to read everything with repressed male sexuality in mind, that is fine, Beau Travail. But let me point you at something else, what I call layered dreaming. Our artist was out at night dreaming but has no recollection what about, except it started with stress and thinking about his wife that he misses. Mitchum smoothly talks him into all gradually coming back to him, and sure enough; he was with this other woman, and sure enough a woman that reminds him of his wife, and wants him home to wait for her. But something weird happens there. He has fallen asleep and wakes up to find a second man, a really puzzling figure. This guy is the key to the whole mystery. He holds together several layers, by shifting stories that shift identities that shift the gears of knowing and dreaming what this is all about. He says he's just a man waiting for her. He is the husband back home, to a wife he enlisted and couldn't wait to get back to, but once he did she didn't want him. He's not the husband, and just met her at the same joint. He wants to marry her but she won't have him. That's a lie too. If you have no imagination, and why would you dream about him if you don't, he's just the pimp a little wobbly from the war himself. Boring. You will know him as our guy, remember he is telling the story and the story is about waking up, so our guy hallucinating different selves and each self has a life out there and comes back home, maybe an empty home, maybe waiting for a woman who is not there, maybe she could be the wife, maybe it isn't even a home, at any rate it is him in that place he comes back to at nights and mutters to himself echoes from that maybe-life out there. If I had to pick a single favorite moment in film noir, this would be it. Not even Welles touches it. As a metaphor about the mind, it's worthy of being in Blowup.

    Edward Dmytryk was one of the most reliable of workman-like directors working in Hollywood from the 1940s to the 1960s. He was responsible for classics like FAREWELL MY LOVELY, THE DEVIL COMMANDS and THE CAINE MUTINY. CROSSFIRE isn't the best film on the Dmytryk CV, but even a so-so Dmytryk movie is better than most other directors' on their good days. The plot revolves around a group of men recently released from war-service in the US Army, so recently that some of them still wear their uniforms. After an afternoon's hard drinking, a man the soldiers meet in a bar is murdered. It looks like one of the soldiers, Mitch Mitchell (George Cooper), did it, but the police flounder when it comes to finding a motive. The soldier's sergeant, Keeley (Robert Mitchum) is convinced the suspect didn't do the crime and sets out to uncover the true killer himself. The always-terrific Gloria Grahame plays an embittered bar hostess who might be able to give Mitch the nearest thing to an alibi he's going to get. Not sure I like Gloria as a bleached blonde, but the look suits her character exactly. Mitchum's performance is even more laid-back than usual and you get the feeling he thinks he's slumming it in this low-budget picture. But his presence still contributes some gravitas and focus to the story. The fact is that it's not much of a mystery. You'll probably figure out who the killer is first time you lay eyes on him, but even so, I enjoyed watching the plot unfold and seeing how men who fought together show such loyalty to one another despite having little else in common. I'd quite happily sit through this again ...

    Before, during and after every war, we confront the men who have done most of the fighting for us. What they fight for and what we believe they fought for are often two different things. In this movie directed by Edward Dmytryk and written by Richard Brooks is entitled " Crossfire " we see one of the finest actors playing a character he so often detested himself. Robert Ryan plays a hate filled soldier named Montgomery, who with sundry other WWII soldiers just discharged from the service, gather in a hotel to have some fun and enjoy a few drinks. What they didn't count on is, that somewhere in the night hours, playtime becomes a bit rough and a civilian named Samuels (Sam Levene) is killed. Now it's up to Capt. Finlay (Robert Young) and the police to discover who and why the man was murdered. Among the prime suspects is Sargant Keeley (Robert Mitchum) a platoon Sgt. who wants very much to help apprehend the guilty soldier. The Black and White film is filled with black shadows, dark motives and should have garnered several awards for it's effort to expose Bigotry, racism and anti-Semitism. But we can readily understand the reasons when we become aware of the Red Scare during the 1940-50's. Ryan is at his very best in the film as is Mitchum. Excellent tour De force. ****

    As an Army sergeant just released from duty, Robert Ryan creates a scary, thoroughly thought-out characterization, that of a man who has seen battle and killing but is now set free on the streets of America--with no agenda and nowhere to channel his pent-up rage. This "important picture", adapted from Richard Brooks' novel, deals with the police investigation into the beating death of a Jewish civilian, with soldiers as their suspects, yet Ryan's three-dimensional portrait of a man on the edge elevates the material beyond the crime genre. While sorting out the different scenarios which led to the innocent man's death, police captain Robert Young keeps a subdued, beleaguered head, which allows Ryan the room to go into his nervy Jekyll-and-Hyde arias. There isn't much suspense or surprise in the story, and one can't tell for sure if any was intended; Edward Dmytryk has directed the film in a brutal and straightforward fashion. The original theme of Brooks' story was homophobia but, that being deemed too controversial for 1947, it was changed to anti-Semitism; the irony, of course, was that Dmytryk caught the attention of the House Un-American Activities Committee on the basis of this plot-point and was subsequently investigated (later serving jail-time for refusing to cooperate). **1/2 from ****

    Once thematically edgy, now thoroughly banal, director Edward Dmytryk's "Crossfire" relies heavily on its message against anti-Semitism to distinguish it from similar B movie noirs of the 1940s. Taking place in post-WW2 America, the film revolves around an incident in which a group of angry soldiers go out for a night on the town and somehow manage to kill a Jewish man. Confronted by the law, one bigoted soldier shifts the blame to another who, because he has no recollection of the night in question, is unable to shake off the accusations. Trying to make sense of this ordeal are actors Robert Mitchum (who starred in the 1947 noir masterpiece "Out of the Past", released the same year as "Crossfire") and Robert Young, both of whom are investigators. Like many noirs, the film relies heavily on flashbacks, which are used to flesh out the motivations of the film's cast. Themes of racial and social intolerance are brought up, but the film is overly elaborative, our hands held at every turn. By the film's end we feel like we've watched a condescending Stanley Kramer message movie, rather than a genuinely atmospheric noir. 6/10  Condescending and preachy, despite its worthy message. Watch the excellent "Out of the Past" instead.

    In the Post WWII, Police Captain Finlay (Robert Young) investigates the murder of the Jewish Joseph "Sammy" Samuels (Sam Levene) in his apartment after a beating with his team. Out of the blue, soldier Montgomery "Monty" (Robert Ryan) comes to the apartment and tells that three soldiers  Corporal Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell (George Cooper), soldier Floyd Bowers (Steve Brodie) and himself  had been in the apartment drinking with Sammy, and Mitch would have been the last one to leave the place. Finlay finds Mitch's wallet on the couch and he becomes the prime suspect. Finlay visits Sergeant Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum) and he tells that his friend Mitch is a sensitive artist incapable to kill a man. Keeley decides to investigate the case to protect and clear the name of his friend. When Keeley discuss the evidences with Finlay, the captain concludes that Mitch did not have the motive to kill Sammy, who was a stranger that he met in a bar. Now Captain Finlay has another suspect and he decides to plot a scheme to expose the assassin. "Crossfire" is a great film-noir, with top-notch director (Edward Dmytryk) and cast with three Roberts - Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan and Robert Young; excellent story of murder and prejudice; magnificent screenplay that uses flashbacks to disclose and solve the mystery; and very impressive quotes. The theme  hatred against Jews  is unusual and this is the first time that I see a film-noir with this type of sordid story (and without the femme fatale). My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Rancor" ("Rancor")

    Many of the characters in "Crossfire" speak in a cadence that creates an almost surreal mood. Sam Levine, Paul Kelly and George Cooper all speak as though they are under the control of the same hypnotist. It could just be that the scriptwriter was unable to develop distinctly different characters, but it works well in this film, giving it a quality that has helped secure its place as a classic of film noir. The movie was based on "The Brick Foxhole", a novel by Richard Brooks. In the book the victim was black, but for various reasons, the murdered man in the film became a Jew, with anti-Semitism as the theme. Although Richard Brooks didn't write the screenplay, he later became a film director. Like John Huston with whom he worked on the script of "The Killers", he was a complete storyteller; he wrote as well as produced and directed. He made some sharp films: "Blackboard Jungle", "Elmer Gantry", "In Cold Blood" and one I like that many don't, "Lord Jim". He was also a tough dude; I once read that he sat Burt Lancaster on his backside after an argument turned physical. The story of "Crossfire", which takes place in New York just after World War Two, begins with the murder of a man, Joseph Samuels played by Sam Levene. A pipe-smoking policeman, Captain Finlay, played by Robert Young, investigates the crime. Young's performance is a precursor to the sage characters he later brought to full flower in television's "Father Knows Best" and "Marcus Welby MD". A number of soldiers were in the murdered man's apartment just prior to his slaying. Robert Ryan gave an acclaimed performance in this film as Montgomery, one of the soldiers in question. Big, sneering and manipulative, he invests the part with a nastiness that is palpable. At first, suspicion falls on another soldier, Mitchell. As part of the investigation, Captain Finlay calls in Sergeant Keeley, Robert Mitchum's character. Keeley tries to protect Mitchell, even arranging for Mitchell's wife to come to town. During a flashback, the film follows Mitchell on the night of the murder where he encounters some unusual characters including Ginny (Gloria Graham), a depressed dancehall "hostess". Eventually, he ends up at Ginny's apartment. Here he encounters a man, listed in the end credits as "The man", played by Paul Kelly; an unusual performance, his character emerges as forlorn, slightly twisted and possibly dangerous  adding another intriguing layer to this unusual story. The film ends abruptly, and conforms to conventions of the period, which allowed no crime to go unpunished. Montgomery is revealed as the murderer and although unarmed, is shot in the back by Captain Finlay in an almost matter-of-fact manner  showing that codes of conduct can change over 60 years. The budget limitations work in the film's favour with much of the story set at night to disguise the studio sets. The end result was a shadowy, claustrophobic world that was perfect for the telling of its taut tale.

    The movie dramatizes an important subject: anti-Semitism. The problem is that it does not generate the outrage and indignation that the subject warrants. This happens partly because the subject is treated in the context of a conventional Hollywood crime drama which further dilutes and distracts attention away from the theme. Furthermore, the principal character, an Army veteran just discharged from the service, is not a completely unsympathetic character; he has legitimate issues too which could be distorting his thoughts. In short, the movie is to be commended for taking on the topic of bigotry but does not go far enough in driving home the subject. Robert Ryan is excellent as the army veteran who is an anti-Semite and the rest of cast is excellent too. Yet the movie does not leave one with a feeling of social injustice. Rather, it leaves one feeling glad that a murderer has been caught but with no resolution of the larger political and social questions which although addressed remain unanswered.

    (Movie quote) - "Hate is like a loaded gun." Released in 1947 - Crossfire stars the 3 "Roberts" - That's Mitchum, Ryan & Young. Crossfire was probably the first Hollywood picture to actually explore racial bigotry - This time in the form of anti-Semitism. Crossfire also addresses post-WW2 issues of soldiers being released from military duty with no other training besides that of being servicemen. Set in Washington, DC - A kindly, soft-spoken man named Joseph Samuels is savagely beaten to death (in his own apartment) by a drunken, recently demobilized American soldier simply because he was Jewish. Due to some incriminating evidence, an innocent soldier is mistakenly blamed for the murder. When this soldier disappears, Detective Finlay, who's investigating the case, must carefully piece together all of the clues to establish the motive behind all of the apparent senselessness. In a series of well-timed flashbacks the whole truth behind the story finally unfolds, escalating to a most brilliant climax. Crossfire is an intelligent, well-crafted film with an excellent script and wonderful performances from a real top-notch cast, especially that of Robert Mitchum as Sargeant Keeley.

    In shadowy Washington, DC, an unidentifiable man beats another man to death, then leaves with his drunken companion. A girlfriend calls pipe-smoking police investigator Robert Young (as Finlay). He begins to question the suspects - a group of discharged military men enjoying relative peace after the end of World War II. First arriving on the scene is Robert Ryan (as "Monty" Montgomery); he expects to find a friend who was with the victim earlier. Next questioned is soldier Robert Mitchum (as Peter Keeley); he tries to steer Mr. Young away from the number one suspect - distraught George Cooper (as Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell)... "Crossfire" has outstanding direction (by Edward Dmytryk), black-and-white photography (by J. Roy Hunt) and performances. RKO and producer Adrian Scott were rewarded with five "Oscar" nominations; probably, Mr. Ryan's startlingly bigoted characterization stood the best chance of winning; he was nominated in the "Supporting Actor" category, but finished as #5 in the "New York Film Critics" contest for leading actor. "Best Picture" consideration was also noted by "Film Daily" (#7 for the year), the "National Board of Review" (#4) and "New York Film Critics" (#3) - remarkable for what was considered a "B" (minor) film... Top-billed Young has one of his best roles and Mr. Cooper's sensitive artist is an amazing film debut. Almost posing as a red herring, Mr. Mitchum is subdued. In smaller roles, browbeaten Steve Brodie (as Floyd Bowers) and "hillbilly" William Phipps (as Leroy) play extraordinarily well against Ryan. Another award nominee, "working girl" Gloria Grahame (as Virginia "Ginny" Tremaine) is great with both Cooper and her dishonorably discharged husband Paul Kelly. Also benefiting from Mr. Dmytryk and the groundbreaking "hate crime" story are victim Sam Levene (Joseph "Sammy" Samuels) and heartbroken Jacqueline White (as Mary). ********* Crossfire (7/22/47) Edward Dmytryk ~ Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Robert Mitchum, George Cooper

    This starts like it always happens, bunch of people in a bar. There is a woman involved. Later in the apartment, the husband turns up dead and the suspect is one of a group of soldiers. I will recommend this to you as an unfairly neglected gem, especially to seasoned noir fans who appreciate how film noir is all about a narrator succumbing to hallucination. Its reputation - tense but obvious - is a little tarnished because the main thrust against racial prejudice is overstated, so it's easy to contend yourself that you know so have the upper hand and nothing beyond the hardboiled mystery is worth paying serious attention to. Not so, not so by a mile my friends. The Jewish angle was introduced to make this pose as a serious postwar lesson, you will know it is plain tacky from how quickly the police captain can suss it out as the root of evil. And nothing more patronizing than the captain lecturing about it a young hick from Tennessee, playing up the same stereotype it warns against. You may appreciate this a little more, anyway, when you learn that it was changed from homosexuality in the originating text. Traces are cleverly preserved in the film so be on the lookout. So the bulk of the film is male hierarchy between soldiers, so people in transit, inbetween lives, inbetween shifting of identities.

    Many of the characters in "Crossfire" speak in a cadence that creates an almost surreal mood. Sam Levine, Paul Kelly and George Cooper all speak as though they are under the control of the same hypnotist. It could just be that the scriptwriter was unable to develop distinctly different characters, but it works well in this film, giving it a quality that has helped secure its place as a classic of film noir. The movie was based on "The Brick Foxhole", a novel by Richard Brooks. In the book the victim was black, but for various reasons, the murdered man in the film became a Jew, with anti-Semitism as the theme. Although Richard Brooks didn't write the screenplay, he later became a film director. Like John Huston with whom he worked on the script of "The Killers", he was a complete storyteller; he wrote as well as produced and directed. He made some sharp films: "Blackboard Jungle", "Elmer Gantry", "In Cold Blood" and one I like that many don't, "Lord Jim". He was also a tough dude; I once read that he sat Burt Lancaster on his backside after an argument turned physical. The story of "Crossfire", which takes place in New York just after World War Two, begins with the murder of a man, Joseph Samuels played by Sam Levene. A pipe-smoking policeman, Captain Finlay, played by Robert Young, investigates the crime. Young's performance is a precursor to the sage characters he later brought to full flower in television's "Father Knows Best" and "Marcus Welby MD". A number of soldiers were in the murdered man's apartment just prior to his slaying. Robert Ryan gave an acclaimed performance in this film as Montgomery, one of the soldiers in question. Big, sneering and manipulative, he invests the part with a nastiness that is palpable. At first, suspicion falls on another soldier, Mitchell. As part of the investigation, Captain Finlay calls in Sergeant Keeley, Robert Mitchum's character. Keeley tries to protect Mitchell, even arranging for Mitchell's wife to come to town. During a flashback, the film follows Mitchell on the night of the murder where he encounters some unusual characters including Ginny (Gloria Graham), a depressed dancehall "hostess". Eventually, he ends up at Ginny's apartment. Here he encounters a man, listed in the end credits as "The man", played by Paul Kelly; an unusual performance, his character emerges as forlorn, slightly twisted and possibly dangerous  adding another intriguing layer to this unusual story. The film ends abruptly, and conforms to conventions of the period, which allowed no crime to go unpunished. Montgomery is revealed as the murderer and although unarmed, is shot in the back by Captain Finlay in an almost matter-of-fact manner  showing that codes of conduct can change over 60 years. The budget limitations work in the film's favour with much of the story set at night to disguise the studio sets. The end result was a shadowy, claustrophobic world that was perfect for the telling of its taut tale.

    The movie dramatizes an important subject: anti-Semitism. The problem is that it does not generate the outrage and indignation that the subject warrants. This happens partly because the subject is treated in the context of a conventional Hollywood crime drama which further dilutes and distracts attention away from the theme. Furthermore, the principal character, an Army veteran just discharged from the service, is not a completely unsympathetic character; he has legitimate issues too which could be distorting his thoughts. In short, the movie is to be commended for taking on the topic of bigotry but does not go far enough in driving home the subject. Robert Ryan is excellent as the army veteran who is an anti-Semite and the rest of cast is excellent too. Yet the movie does not leave one with a feeling of social injustice. Rather, it leaves one feeling glad that a murderer has been caught but with no resolution of the larger political and social questions which although addressed remain unanswered.

    (Movie quote) - "Hate is like a loaded gun." Released in 1947 - Crossfire stars the 3 "Roberts" - That's Mitchum, Ryan & Young. Crossfire was probably the first Hollywood picture to actually explore racial bigotry - This time in the form of anti-Semitism. Crossfire also addresses post-WW2 issues of soldiers being released from military duty with no other training besides that of being servicemen. Set in Washington, DC - A kindly, soft-spoken man named Joseph Samuels is savagely beaten to death (in his own apartment) by a drunken, recently demobilized American soldier simply because he was Jewish. Due to some incriminating evidence, an innocent soldier is mistakenly blamed for the murder. When this soldier disappears, Detective Finlay, who's investigating the case, must carefully piece together all of the clues to establish the motive behind all of the apparent senselessness. In a series of well-timed flashbacks the whole truth behind the story finally unfolds, escalating to a most brilliant climax. Crossfire is an intelligent, well-crafted film with an excellent script and wonderful performances from a real top-notch cast, especially that of Robert Mitchum as Sargeant Keeley.

    In shadowy Washington, DC, an unidentifiable man beats another man to death, then leaves with his drunken companion. A girlfriend calls pipe-smoking police investigator Robert Young (as Finlay). He begins to question the suspects - a group of discharged military men enjoying relative peace after the end of World War II. First arriving on the scene is Robert Ryan (as "Monty" Montgomery); he expects to find a friend who was with the victim earlier. Next questioned is soldier Robert Mitchum (as Peter Keeley); he tries to steer Mr. Young away from the number one suspect - distraught George Cooper (as Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell)... "Crossfire" has outstanding direction (by Edward Dmytryk), black-and-white photography (by J. Roy Hunt) and performances. RKO and producer Adrian Scott were rewarded with five "Oscar" nominations; probably, Mr. Ryan's startlingly bigoted characterization stood the best chance of winning; he was nominated in the "Supporting Actor" category, but finished as #5 in the "New York Film Critics" contest for leading actor. "Best Picture" consideration was also noted by "Film Daily" (#7 for the year), the "National Board of Review" (#4) and "New York Film Critics" (#3) - remarkable for what was considered a "B" (minor) film... Top-billed Young has one of his best roles and Mr. Cooper's sensitive artist is an amazing film debut. Almost posing as a red herring, Mr. Mitchum is subdued. In smaller roles, browbeaten Steve Brodie (as Floyd Bowers) and "hillbilly" William Phipps (as Leroy) play extraordinarily well against Ryan. Another award nominee, "working girl" Gloria Grahame (as Virginia "Ginny" Tremaine) is great with both Cooper and her dishonorably discharged husband Paul Kelly. Also benefiting from Mr. Dmytryk and the groundbreaking "hate crime" story are victim Sam Levene (Joseph "Sammy" Samuels) and heartbroken Jacqueline White (as Mary). ********* Crossfire (7/22/47) Edward Dmytryk ~ Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Robert Mitchum, George Cooper

    This starts like it always happens, bunch of people in a bar. There is a woman involved. Later in the apartment, the husband turns up dead and the suspect is one of a group of soldiers. I will recommend this to you as an unfairly neglected gem, especially to seasoned noir fans who appreciate how film noir is all about a narrator succumbing to hallucination. Its reputation - tense but obvious - is a little tarnished because the main thrust against racial prejudice is overstated, so it's easy to contend yourself that you know so have the upper hand and nothing beyond the hardboiled mystery is worth paying serious attention to. Not so, not so by a mile my friends. The Jewish angle was introduced to make this pose as a serious postwar lesson, you will know it is plain tacky from how quickly the police captain can suss it out as the root of evil. And nothing more patronizing than the captain lecturing about it a young hick from Tennessee, playing up the same stereotype it warns against. You may appreciate this a little more, anyway, when you learn that it was changed from homosexuality in the originating text. Traces are cleverly preserved in the film so be on the lookout. So the bulk of the film is male hierarchy between soldiers, so people in transit, inbetween lives, inbetween shifting of identities. One of them used to be a cop in that other life, another an artist so a sensitive man. Now they're all in the same uniform stationed in the same limbo and all sorts of wounds from the war have not healed. So here's a film that, already by '47, can elucidate what noir is all about and why it feels the way it does; it's about men returned from the certainty of killing, chaos that was nevertheless safety because ordered from above, to open life where you, it had to be you now, had to be someone again and responsible for your own story. So it was a stressful thing, because it could turn out that you are no one at all and have no story, hence the dissolution of self so common in noir, hence the hallucinations, the world conspiring against you, the feeling of dazed powerlessness disguised as fate from above. One option you have is to read everything with repressed male sexuality in mind, that is fine, Beau Travail. But let me point you at something else, what I call layered dreaming. Our artist was out at night dreaming but has no recollection what about, except it started with stress and thinking about his wife that he misses. Mitchum smoothly talks him into all gradually coming back to him, and sure enough; he was with this other woman, and sure enough a woman that reminds him of his wife, and wants him home to wait for her. But something weird happens there. He has fallen asleep and wakes up to find a second man, a really puzzling figure. This guy is the key to the whole mystery. He holds together several layers, by shifting stories that shift identities that shift the gears of knowing and dreaming what this is all about. He says he's just a man waiting for her. He is the husband back home, to a wife he enlisted and couldn't wait to get back to, but once he did she didn't want him. He's not the husband, and just met her at the same joint. He wants to marry her but she won't have him. That's a lie too. If you have no imagination, and why would you dream about him if you don't, he's just the pimp a little wobbly from the war himself. Boring. You will know him as our guy, remember he is telling the story and the story is about waking up, so our guy hallucinating different selves and each self has a life out there and comes back home, maybe an empty home, maybe waiting for a woman who is not there, maybe she could be the wife, maybe it isn't even a home, at any rate it is him in that place he comes back to at nights and mutters to himself echoes from that maybe-life out there. If I had to pick a single favorite moment in film noir, this would be it. Not even Welles touches it. As a metaphor about the mind, it's worthy of being in Blowup.

    Edward Dmytryk was one of the most reliable of workman-like directors working in Hollywood from the 1940s to the 1960s. He was responsible for classics like FAREWELL MY LOVELY, THE DEVIL COMMANDS and THE CAINE MUTINY. CROSSFIRE isn't the best film on the Dmytryk CV, but even a so-so Dmytryk movie is better than most other directors' on their good days. The plot revolves around a group of men recently released from war-service in the US Army, so recently that some of them still wear their uniforms. After an afternoon's hard drinking, a man the soldiers meet in a bar is murdered. It looks like one of the soldiers, Mitch Mitchell (George Cooper), did it, but the police flounder when it comes to finding a motive. The soldier's sergeant, Keeley (Robert Mitchum) is convinced the suspect didn't do the crime and sets out to uncover the true killer himself. The always-terrific Gloria Grahame plays an embittered bar hostess who might be able to give Mitch the nearest thing to an alibi he's going to get. Not sure I like Gloria as a bleached blonde, but the look suits her character exactly. Mitchum's performance is even more laid-back than usual and you get the feeling he thinks he's slumming it in this low-budget picture. But his presence still contributes some gravitas and focus to the story. The fact is that it's not much of a mystery. You'll probably figure out who the killer is first time you lay eyes on him, but even so, I enjoyed watching the plot unfold and seeing how men who fought together show such loyalty to one another despite having little else in common. I'd quite happily sit through this again ...

    Before, during and after every war, we confront the men who have done most of the fighting for us. What they fight for and what we believe they fought for are often two different things. In this movie directed by Edward Dmytryk and written by Richard Brooks is entitled " Crossfire " we see one of the finest actors playing a character he so often detested himself. Robert Ryan plays a hate filled soldier named Montgomery, who with sundry other WWII soldiers just discharged from the service, gather in a hotel to have some fun and enjoy a few drinks. What they didn't count on is, that somewhere in the night hours, playtime becomes a bit rough and a civilian named Samuels (Sam Levene) is killed. Now it's up to Capt. Finlay (Robert Young) and the police to discover who and why the man was murdered. Among the prime suspects is Sargant Keeley (Robert Mitchum) a platoon Sgt. who wants very much to help apprehend the guilty soldier. The Black and White film is filled with black shadows, dark motives and should have garnered several awards for it's effort to expose Bigotry, racism and anti-Semitism. But we can readily understand the reasons when we become aware of the Red Scare during the 1940-50's. Ryan is at his very best in the film as is Mitchum. Excellent tour De force. ****

    As an Army sergeant just released from duty, Robert Ryan creates a scary, thoroughly thought-out characterization, that of a man who has seen battle and killing but is now set free on the streets of America--with no agenda and nowhere to channel his pent-up rage. This "important picture", adapted from Richard Brooks' novel, deals with the police investigation into the beating death of a Jewish civilian, with soldiers as their suspects, yet Ryan's three-dimensional portrait of a man on the edge elevates the material beyond the crime genre. While sorting out the different scenarios which led to the innocent man's death, police captain Robert Young keeps a subdued, beleaguered head, which allows Ryan the room to go into his nervy Jekyll-and-Hyde arias. There isn't much suspense or surprise in the story, and one can't tell for sure if any was intended; Edward Dmytryk has directed the film in a brutal and straightforward fashion. The original theme of Brooks' story was homophobia but, that being deemed too controversial for 1947, it was changed to anti-Semitism; the irony, of course, was that Dmytryk caught the attention of the House Un-American Activities Committee on the basis of this plot-point and was subsequently investigated (later serving jail-time for refusing to cooperate). **1/2 from ****

    Once thematically edgy, now thoroughly banal, director Edward Dmytryk's "Crossfire" relies heavily on its message against anti-Semitism to distinguish it from similar B movie noirs of the 1940s. Taking place in post-WW2 America, the film revolves around an incident in which a group of angry soldiers go out for a night on the town and somehow manage to kill a Jewish man. Confronted by the law, one bigoted soldier shifts the blame to another who, because he has no recollection of the night in question, is unable to shake off the accusations. Trying to make sense of this ordeal are actors Robert Mitchum (who starred in the 1947 noir masterpiece "Out of the Past", released the same year as "Crossfire") and Robert Young, both of whom are investigators. Like many noirs, the film relies heavily on flashbacks, which are used to flesh out the motivations of the film's cast. Themes of racial and social intolerance are brought up, but the film is overly elaborative, our hands held at every turn. By the film's end we feel like we've watched a condescending Stanley Kramer message movie, rather than a genuinely atmospheric noir. 6/10  Condescending and preachy, despite its worthy message. Watch the excellent "Out of the Past" instead.
