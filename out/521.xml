    In 1975, America was leaving Vietnam as the communist Southeast Asia country fell under communist control. Hollywood at the time had already made a Vietnam movie and that film was John Wayne's The Green Berets. That film became the first pro-war film about the Vietnam War. In other words, the war is good. Well, that didn't fit well with the critics. Critics in that time in 1968 wanted a serious movie about the Vietnam War. It wasn't till 1978, about 10 years later, that Hollywood made the first anti-war about the Vietnam War. That film, of course was The Deer Hunter. It told the story about three Pennsylvania steel-workers who are having the time of their lives. Among the ordinary jobs they have, they also have a wedding before they are send to Vietnam to fight. The three men are played, very through and very strong, by Robert De Niro, John Savage and Christopher Walken, who won a Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The three men leave the USA to go to Vietnam. They had no idea what kind of physical and mental destruction awaits them. The three men are forced to play Russian Roulette in a Vietcong hut. They have to survive the war and their aftermath. But, tragedy strikes and changes their lives, forever. As I said before, The Deer Hunter, has a lot of great performances by the three leading men and also, Meryl Streep, who is so effective as the role, Linda. The Deer Hunter took home 5 Oscars, including Best Picture. I felt that the movie works on character development. And, when we see the aftermath of the war, we see the aftermath of the three men. Director Michael Cimino tells this tale of war very thoroughly. Even though it runs 3 hours, it never runs out of steam. And even in the Russian Roulette scene, I felt so choked up that I felt like someone was strangling me. The suspense of that scene put me on edge. There's no doubt in my mind that The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978. After The Deer Hunter, other great Vietnam movies came along. Movies like Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July and Platoon followed. And even when The Deer Hunter was released in 1978, other films told different tales about the war. Go Tell the Spartans was another film that dealt with the topic of the Vietnam War. The Deer Hunter is a shattering, heroic and deeply effective war drama. **** 4 stars.

    Michael Cimino directs this long character study & war picture that follows a group of friends from a wedding, to a deer hunting trip, to finally the Vietnam war and its aftermath. Over three hour film details their lives before & after the war, on both the men and their families. Fine cast includes Robert De Nero, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep, who all deliver heartfelt and believable performances, but the trouble is that the extended POW sequence involving Russian Roulette just feels so bizarre and extreme, that I had a hard time buying it, especially when one of the characters becomes obsessed with it after their ordeal is over. Somehow, this drags the film down, and by the end, instead of feeling emotionally drained(like many of the audience claimed) the film felt emotionally muted, like it had gone too far afield and lost sight of what it was supposed to be about. Still, a minority view I suppose, since it did win an Academy Award for best picture and director.

    Watch this film. The film speaks to the lives we live and i think the director is making a point about free will, or the concept of it. There are choices we get to make in life, and there are situations that are thrust upon us that we have no control over. Going to Vietnam, Getting married, Being the type of hunter who is majestic and believes in a principle ( one shot ) or runs around like a sloppy drunk shooting nonsense into the air... these are the choices that we make in our life. Then there is the gun. You have no choice on if the bullet is in the chamber, or if it is not. The only choice you should have is if you play the game, that choice was taken from these young men which effected them all differently. 1) De Niro plays the idealistic character, the type who believes in things more important than hedonistic pleasure. This is why when he hunts, he uses the one bullet belief, and there is a moment between him and his prey. 2) Walken plays the agnostic type view, he neither hates nor loves the idealism of De Niro, but instead takes no stance on it at first and simply reflects on the beauty of the tree's and wondering if he is an asshole or not. 3) Steve: forget the actor's name, but he represents the boy who never really became a man, his thoughts are never deeply explored, but his actions reveal his thoughts, that he neither holds idealism or can rely strictly on self reflection and earthly delights. the effects of Gun on each: De Niro: De Niro's idealism goes out the window when presented with life or death questions, he is the closest to being a theist in his views and becomes an atheist in that murky rat filled water. We know this when he tells Walken they are going to abandon Steve. De Niro throws any sense of idealism out the window from then on out, and realizes that we cannot make and uphold our's or anyone else's "rules"... that we only have choices and reactions to our situations. De Niro's abandonment of his idealism is what saves him, and why he does not kill the deer at the end, he has learned that life it's self, or the joy of the hunt is the true purpose, and not the idealism of actually killing your prey with one shot. Walken: Walkens character at first can deal with the situation, but becomes stuck in that moment and cannot escape it. He has no idealism to loose, and now the beauty of the tree's has gone, and he has nothing left but self reflection. He cannot get past why the bullet was not in the chamber for him, and must repeat the situation until he feels he has taken control back over his life, of course he can only do this by ending his life. Steve: Steve being the eternal boy he is needs to be saved, cracks first, and is dependent on everyone else. In the end we realize our own traditions and idealism or lack there of lead us to certain points, some we can over come and some we cannot. De Niro comes out the best because he see's this and reacts to it, Walken and Steve are forever stuck in that moment. This is how the movie effected me personally.

    I want to say few words for this movie which is landmark for the end of Vietnam era. I know that it hurts for the American people to recall over and over again for this social experiment, so to call. I am not an American and if it was 40 years ago I would have never had a chance to write this review. As an Easterner we people from the Soviet bloc showed solidarity to the fight of the Vietnamese people and strangely enough I remember that some alimony and other salvation stuff was gathered from the civil population. I also know but can not support it with figures that the Warsaw Pact had sent some military force to Northern Vietnam; so it was not war America vs. Vietnam, but America vs. Vietnam plus Allies. Those are general truths and I am not withholding some state secret. Now let's talk about the movie. If it was only for the death of one of the principal actors in the film (John Cazale), that movie wouldn't have been worthy. Unfortunately, the movie received much spit from its critics and intentionally didn't received its full acclaim as first one shot at the war theater - before "Apocalypse Now" and before the Rambo series, etc. Bad luck was also that at Oscar 1979 it had to compete with another equally shattering film ("Midnight Express" - about life in Turkish prisons) which I think that is no less valuable than the Vietnamese saga, with remarkable supportive role from John Hurt. And also "Superman" (1978) was there and how is it possible not to receive a nickel. Thank you!

    It seems criminal, giving a multiple Oscar winner a negative review, yet alone an extremely loathing one. But the Academy has made some mistakes in the past in my eyes. Giving Sean Penn an Oscar nomination for I Am Sam or awarding Mel Gibson's Braveheart Best Picture. Michael Cimino's 'masterpiece' The Deer Hunter is one such example of a motion picture that gained massive praise on its original release but is, in my eyes, a dreadful hackneyed melodrama that tries to come across as meaningful and poignant when it is in reality, xenophobic, pretentious, boring and self-indulgent. It fails to be in anyway enduring nor does it make up for its three hour running length. It's honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen and even when I watched it again, I still couldn't fathom it. Three Russian-American friends, Mike, Nick and Steven, living in a small town in Pennyslvania, are about to go off to fight in Vietnam. Steven is getting married and Nick is in a loving relationship with Linda whom Mike is secretly in love with. Before heading off to fight in the war, the trio and their friends attend Steven's wedding and go off deer hunting. However, in Vietnam, they are trapped in terrible conditions as the Vietnamese endlessly torment them with games of Russian roulette. They manage to escape with Mike and Steven returning to their home with Nick staying in Saigon, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and now playing Russian roulette professionally. Steven ends up in a veteran's home whilst Mike tries to return to Saigon to save Nick as the city is about to fall to the Vietnamese. The Deer Hunter can be described as a blatant propaganda film. Cimino tries to tell the story from the perspective of the American soldiers who fight in the war and the effects of it. The Vietnamese side of the conflict is in no way explored though. They are portrayed as mindless child-killing gamblers with no remorse or mercy in their treatment of U.S soldiers. The playing Russian roulette element never occurred in the war and just appears to give the characters some traumatic experience to go through. The film comes across as a jingoistic feature that tries to appeal to the American audience. It's understandable why the film would've been critically acclaimed on its original release as America was still recovering from the war and seeing the Vietnamese as a group of sadistic monsters gave them some validity in their anger and despair. Nowadays, however, this comes across as manipulative nonsense trying to pass off as a compelling melodrama. The film feels too needlessly long at three hours and feels even longer than that. Many long films make up for their running lengths like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Seven Samurai and The Godfather Part II. But because Cimino uses an abundance of long unedited shots that should last for a few seconds, the film feels more like three days as opposed to three hours. The scene where they go hunting and annoy one of their friends by throwing his boots off the car is profoundly tedious and in no way engaging. The film also seems to want to talk about the effects of the war on American soldiers but if there is any underlying message throughout it, Cimino didn't convey it well. Maybe he felt that showing these men screaming and going hysterical would give the audience some dramatic heft to show the effects of the conflict. The film also consists of tediously repetitive dialogue with characters mumbling a bunch of crap at each other and getting drunk, singing and dancing like a bunch of idiots. The first act where the characters are all celebrating borders on boring and headache-inducing. The actors here don't do much to give their flatly written and one- dimensional characters any weight. Robert De Niro mumbles his way through the script, like a drunk. Christopher Walken just plays himself here though less entertaining than he normally is. John Savage's acting flip-flops between dull and random screaming. Meryl Streep doesn't do much with her character either to make her any identifiable. To the credit of these actors who have pretty much done great in other films, the faults mainly lie with the script and the direction and the fact that their characters barely have any personality. The Deer Hunter is one of those films that has no substance nor any dignity to accommodate the overly-long running length or even convey the effects of war properly, only by showing that it is damaging to American soldiers and it's all the Vietnamese' fault. It's a thoroughly hateful and tedious work and not something that I would like to revisit.

    This movie starts well but as soon as the protagonists get to Vietnam it just gets very - silly. The Soviets staged a walkout at the Berlin Film Festival when this was shown. I'm not surprised. The first Vietnamese depicted on the screen commits an atrocity on civilian women and children (that way we know who the baddies are). He pays for his crime, however, when the hero burns him alive - hooray! Then, all the heroes are captured by the enemy. Oh no! How could this happen? We are spared the humiliation of viewing this terrible event because next up is a hideous torture scene. Who knew that the Commies played Russian roulette with their (highly valuable) US prisoners? Never fear, the heroes kill their captors and escape! Luckily they can just float down the river to be picked up - then dropped back in the river? Oh well - back to Saigon where they are able to overcome the trauma of captivity - by playing some more Russian roulette? And so it goes until the movie ends with a rousing rendition of "God Bless America" - the US must have won the war after all! Oscars for everybody!! ** SPOILERS ** Some deer were injured in the making of this movie ** SPOILERS **

    The Deer Hunter is the type of movie that when you watch it you can't have anything else on your mind. Today's generation more often than not use their phones while they watch a movie, distracting them from the story at hand by text messages, social networking sites, and emails. When you watch The Deer Hunter, turn your phones off, put away the snacks, and empty your mind completely of any lingering predicaments they may have happened prior to sitting down to watch the film. The only way to experience The Deer Hunter is to live it. Director Michael Cimno is the showcased party from The Deer Hunter. The loose narrative allows Cimno to fully capture the characters, their struggles, and mental scarring. The script isn't cemented, which gives Cimno a lot of freedom. It's almost like we're watching a documentary of this group of people, the storytelling isn't very structured...but it works. I normally despise movies that don't get to the point they're trying to make, but The Deer Hunter struck me in a way no film of its nature has done before. It invested me into the lives of the characters, I really cared about what was going on, in a movie where not much does go on. The power Cimmo releases on the screen is admirable. The film's split into three segregated pieces: before war, during war, and after war. The Deer Hunter holds up the war to our faces and asks is this necessary? People who didn't go to war, get the point-blank experience of it through the film's gripping, raw, distressing transcendence of feelings. War changes people, we get to live that fully with The Deer Hunter. The first act, we get to know these characters as people. We identify with their day-to-day lives, living situations, and friendships. During the war, Cimno hits us with some painful scenes, including the iconic Russian Roulette sequence. It's an unforgettable, incredibly crafted scene in not just this film, but the war genre. It explores male sensitivity and the bonds that ignite in wartime. When the third act rolls around, it's about healing the scars from the war. You can see the scars every where you look. It's a catharsis of pain, loss, and mental disfigurement. Upon its release, controversy ensued due to the Russian Roulette topic covered heavily throughout the film. Apparently there was never any documented use of Russian Roulette and therefore the film was "lying" to the viewer. I dissent these accusations because The Deer Hunter isn't giving a play-by-play shot of the Vietnam war. It's main purpose is to depict the impact the war had on the men serving our country and their families. The Deer Hunter is an fictional, emotionally driven movie, not a news special describing the types of torture methods used in the war. The Deer Hunter would almost be like an acting exercise for its principle actors. Getting to live the big picture of a character, not just the crux of a story that we usually get in movies. The actors here are allowed to experiment with the characters at uninteresting moments and still create drama within those moments. When Robert De Niro puts himself in a role, he doesn't look back. De Niro's strength and susceptibility in the war scenes move your heart around in your chest. Meryl Streep gets to show off in her first meaty role, supplying each moment with a different level of emotion. Christopher Walken has the most complex character and performance; the transformation that his character lives is astounding. The actors bring this movie to life by falling back on the mission statement of the film: to show the effects of war on human beings. There's a specific technique Cimno uses with The Deer Hunter: lingering emotion. As the scene lingers on, emotion grows, and you become overwhelmed by the amount of response you feel in your heart to this film. The extreme length has been highly criticized by moviegoers, and usually I'm one of those people complaining about the unnecessary length in a movie, but here it feels right and is wonderfully fulfilling. Sure, a trim here or there wouldn't have hurt, but Cimno gets away with it because of the robust sentiment. It's a destructive piece that tears into your soul. Not having a distinctive narrative voice, the Cimno is the one who makes the movie the commanding experience that is The Deer Hunter. Some shots are so intense and violent that you shutter at the pain you're watching, but others are beautifully moving it creates a peace in our mind. Filled with numerous sublime performances, a tremendous view on war, and moving tales of the human condition, The Deer Hunter only has a few missteps along the way. You won't soon forget this film, as it will be tugging at your emotion strings long after you complete the movie. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    "The story we tell ourselves about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing, is a lie. The truth lies outside, in what we do." - Zizek A near scene-for-scene remake of 1939's "The Four Feathers", Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter" tells the story of several friends (Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken) from small town Pennsylvania. Early sequences watch as the gang work in a steel mill, congregate and go on hunting expeditions. Cimino's photography, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, is grand throughout, but the film quickly nosedives into pretentious, unintentionally funny territory. Cimino indulges in a prolonged wedding sequence (cribbed from Coppola who cribbed from Visconti), filters "Best Years of Our Lives" through a Vietnam era prism, has DeNiro run about naked like a Method Actor fishing for Oscars, and treats us to a forced sequence in which our heroes play Chopin on a piano whilst looking REALLY REALLY SERIOUS. This is a deep movie, see. The hell of Industrial America then becomes the hell of the Vietnam War. Here our heroes, now American soldiers, watch North Vietnamese savages kill civilians. They're then captured by the Vietnamese and made to play Russian Roulette. They survive this ordeal, but Walken's character is pushed into madness and begins to play Russian Roulette for money in a Saigon gambling hall. Symbolically unable to escape the damage done by Vietnam, he spends six years there, gambling with bullets. You'd think the law of averages would catch up with him, but no. "Don't leave me over there," Walken tells his buddy DeNiro, which leads to DeNiro having the longest delayed reaction in the history of cinema. Eight years later he goes back to Saigon in the hopes of finding Walken, a missing person's search which is apparently really easy. They find each other, Walken commits suicide (partially to punish - and prove his love to - "best man" DeNiro), the film ends with a funeral and a silly, unearned scene in which our gang sing "God Bless America". You can feel Cimino straining with every scene to make a GREAT EPIC. The film won five Oscars. Like most Vietnam war movies, "Hunter" hinges on romanticised madness. Deer hunting becomes a metaphor for "virtuous, humane kills" and Russian Roulette becomes a metaphor for the madness inducing chaos of Vietnam. As is typical of racist war films, the Vietnamese are portrayed as grinning (their dialogue is not even Vietnamese), Oriental savages (introduced with propagandistic scenes showing the NVA killing babies and women) and the "reason" for US defeat is sidestepped by making the Vietnam war itself incomprehensible. Where else but in an irrational country could the US lose a war? Whilst several sequences play with irony (Russian-Americans playing Russian roulette etc), Cimino's tale is one of solemn tragedy. An account of what evil, sadistic, barbaric Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans, the film, like "Apocalypse Now", oozes macho self pity with a dash of counter-culture disillusionment and strained appeals to high culture (Conrad, Eliot, Chopin songs, Orthodox hymns etc). The film is silly elsewhere, with random helicopter rescues, love triangles, many cheesy "dramatic" scenes and exploitative Roulette sequences (why's everyone in Saigaon playing Roulette?) which Cimino shoe-horned from another Las Vegas themed script he was working on. Some critics, like Jonathan Rosenbaum, spotted the film's hokiness right away. Pulitzer Prize winner Peter Arnett would call it a "simplistic lie". As with most war movies, the overriding message is "look what they did to us". Cimino perpetuates the racist stereotype that sustained much of America's involvement in Indochina, and hides behind designer madness and much irrationality. Compare to Pontecorvo's "Burn!", which offered a clear analysis of imperialist expansion, and "In the Year of the Pig" and "Hearts and Minds", two documentaries which the CIA waged war upon and whose theatres met with bomb threats. In 2012, the Pentagon began The Vietnam War Commemoration Project, a 13 year, 65 million dollar propaganda effort to clean up the image of the Vietnam war. What are they covering up? The fact that the North Vietnamese constituted a political movement with near total local, popular support, that the US artificially divided Vietnam in disregard of Geneva negotiations (becase Eisenhower knew over 80 percent of the population would vote for Ho Chi Minh), that the US put in place and backed psycho puppet leaders, that even the South didn't support the US, that the US did everything it could to prevent unification and scuttle elections, that 4 million Vietnamese died, that more bombs were dropped than in all previous wars combined, that tens of thousands were assassinated by the CIA's Phoenix Program, that nukes were threatened 13 times, that US land-mines still kill Vietnamese to this day (52000 and counting), that millions of gallons of poison, herbicide and chemicals were used, that US campaigns in Cambodia were directly responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot (himself supported with 89 million dollars) and the genocide which took place afterwards, that the first Tonkin Gulf incident was started by US aggression, that the second never happened, that over five million villagers were forcibly displaced, that political prisoners were jailed/tortured in "tiger cages" and that 90 percent of Northern levees, hospitals, villages, towns and industries were intentionally bombed. The US has similarly destabilised over 80 countries in the past 100 years. And yet here's a film with the NVA torturing small-town Americans. During and after the Iraq war, US soldiers committed suicide at a rate of 1 every 25 hours. This figure doesn't include attempted suicides (roughly 1900 in 2009 alone). In Vietnam, the number of US suicides totalled about 150,000. In real life, these vets were trapped in a double bind, unable to reconcile their belief that their conflict was righteous with their actual deeds; they thus nihilistically self-destructed. Cimino wants you to believe the opposite; that the NVA pushed men to suicide. 3/10  Depressing.

    Read the reviews by date and one can tell which generation knows war and which does not. The effects shown on the characters is what we see on returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Regardless war is still the same and has lasting effects on the participants just as this movie shows. The acting is good because they are all professionals in the true sense of the word. The script is good because all of it is true to some degree for veterans of the Vietnam debacle. the scenes are authentic-. Racist against Vietnamese-it is what it was. The film should be viewed today as a good history lesson for all. The only thing that has changed is that the steel mill has probably closed.

    The Vietnam War which lasted 15 years and ended in 1975, proved to be one of the costliest wars of our time considering its five million casualties, including the lives of over 60,000 US soldiers. Who won that war is no longer important, but the effect that war has to this day is beyond devastating. In what is easily the best and last significant film of his career, director Michael Cimino delivers a film with a prophetic vision just three years after the war ended, and is the first in a string of Vietnam war movies that is still attempted over three decades on.Having also co-written the screenplay, Cimino's story does not entirely focus on battle scenes or the war itself, but in essence, its aftermath on the lives of ordinary people. For this, his narrative spans three hours, of which the first hour is spent in impeccable character development formally introducing his Russian-American characters in a small Pennsylvanian steel-mill suburb. Mike, Nick, Steven, Stanley and John are five buddies in a typical frat-pack where after work hours are spent in male bonding activities of deer hunting and beer lounging. Their last gathering as a group is at Steven's Russian orthodox wedding reception pending Mike, Nick and Steven's enlistment in the Vietnam War. The wedding is a fun filled extravaganza where everyone has more than a good share of the festivities. Yet tell-tale signs of a devastating future are cleverly manifested through the reception, foretelling that things would never be the same again. Cut to war-torn Vietnam, Mike, Nick and Steven are POWs after a short battle sequence succumbing to North Vietnamese guerrilla tactics. Taking advantage over their captor's sadistic torture methods of Russian Roulette and rat infested imprisonment, the trio makes for a daring escape little knowing their physical and mental scars would haunt them for life. In a botched rescue attempt, their party is split and they never really regroup as before the war. Although welcomed back a hero, Mike finds it hard to adjust to his once perky lifestyle. Steven is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair living in total refusal of his family and friends. The crux of the plot surfaces when Mike goes all the way back to hellish Saigon in keeping his earlier promise where he would never leave Nick behind. What he finds is a ghastly excuse for a lifelong friend who has no recollection of their history. Worse, Nick is involved in a major gambling syndicate the likes of which still disturbs Mike: Russian roulette. Interestingly enough, Francis Ford Coppola brought out the critically acclaimed APOCALYPSE NOW just a year after this film, winning two Oscars in the process for his version of the horrifying atrocities during the war in Vietnam. Though Coppola focused mainly on the war, Cimino's film, metaphorically speaking, is an integration of three acts where graphic scenes in Vietnam form the repugnant sausage in an otherwise edible hotdog. And to think, this film was made thirty years before STOP-LOSS and HOME OF THE BRAVE, similar films about war veterans incapable of reverting to ordinary life. But Cimino had already set the tone of things to come, bagging five Academy Awards including "Best Picture" and "Best Director" out of five nominated categories. The Oscar for "Best Actor in a Supporting Role" also went to Christopher Walken for his outstanding role as Nick. Incidentally, this is Walken's first and only Oscar till date. Having secured an Oscar for his supporting role as the young Vito Corleone in Coppola's THE GODFATHER II and nominated for best supporting actor in the Martin Scorsese 1976 cult classic TAXI DRIVER, it isn't surprising that Robert De Niro was also nominated again for "Best Actor in a Leading Role" as Mike. Perhaps playing a mentally unstable Vietnam Veteran in TAXI DRIVER was all the training he required in adapting a similar themed role as the titled deer hunter. Also worth mentioning is a stunning Meryl Streep in her first ever Oscar nominated role as Linda, a passive women caught between Nick's proposal for marriage and Mike's shy charm. Also embedded in the support line up are John Savage as Steven, George Dzundza as the over eccentric John and John Cazale who passed away shortly after his role as Stanley. More than just a multi-award winning movie, this is one of De Niro's and Walken's building blocks to their currently much deserved status as Hollywood veterans. But wrapping up the perfect package goes to Cimino's credit in consideration of the lack of eye-popping special effects of Hollywood yester years. His reliance on stellar acting, perfectly timed suspense in a visionary plot and the birth of a sub-genre ahead of its time justifies why the American Film Institute has praised this film within the "100 Greatest American Movies of all time".

    In 1975, America was leaving Vietnam as the communist Southeast Asia country fell under communist control. Hollywood at the time had already made a Vietnam movie and that film was John Wayne's The Green Berets. That film became the first pro-war film about the Vietnam War. In other words, the war is good. Well, that didn't fit well with the critics. Critics in that time in 1968 wanted a serious movie about the Vietnam War. It wasn't till 1978, about 10 years later, that Hollywood made the first anti-war about the Vietnam War. That film, of course was The Deer Hunter. It told the story about three Pennsylvania steel-workers who are having the time of their lives. Among the ordinary jobs they have, they also have a wedding before they are send to Vietnam to fight. The three men are played, very through and very strong, by Robert De Niro, John Savage and Christopher Walken, who won a Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The three men leave the USA to go to Vietnam. They had no idea what kind of physical and mental destruction awaits them. The three men are forced to play Russian Roulette in a Vietcong hut. They have to survive the war and their aftermath. But, tragedy strikes and changes their lives, forever. As I said before, The Deer Hunter, has a lot of great performances by the three leading men and also, Meryl Streep, who is so effective as the role, Linda. The Deer Hunter took home 5 Oscars, including Best Picture. I felt that the movie works on character development. And, when we see the aftermath of the war, we see the aftermath of the three men. Director Michael Cimino tells this tale of war very thoroughly. Even though it runs 3 hours, it never runs out of steam. And even in the Russian Roulette scene, I felt so choked up that I felt like someone was strangling me. The suspense of that scene put me on edge. There's no doubt in my mind that The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978. After The Deer Hunter, other great Vietnam movies came along. Movies like Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July and Platoon followed. And even when The Deer Hunter was released in 1978, other films told different tales about the war. Go Tell the Spartans was another film that dealt with the topic of the Vietnam War. The Deer Hunter is a shattering, heroic and deeply effective war drama. **** 4 stars.

    Michael Cimino directs this long character study & war picture that follows a group of friends from a wedding, to a deer hunting trip, to finally the Vietnam war and its aftermath. Over three hour film details their lives before & after the war, on both the men and their families. Fine cast includes Robert De Nero, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep, who all deliver heartfelt and believable performances, but the trouble is that the extended POW sequence involving Russian Roulette just feels so bizarre and extreme, that I had a hard time buying it, especially when one of the characters becomes obsessed with it after their ordeal is over. Somehow, this drags the film down, and by the end, instead of feeling emotionally drained(like many of the audience claimed) the film felt emotionally muted, like it had gone too far afield and lost sight of what it was supposed to be about. Still, a minority view I suppose, since it did win an Academy Award for best picture and director.

    Watch this film. The film speaks to the lives we live and i think the director is making a point about free will, or the concept of it. There are choices we get to make in life, and there are situations that are thrust upon us that we have no control over. Going to Vietnam, Getting married, Being the type of hunter who is majestic and believes in a principle ( one shot ) or runs around like a sloppy drunk shooting nonsense into the air... these are the choices that we make in our life. Then there is the gun. You have no choice on if the bullet is in the chamber, or if it is not. The only choice you should have is if you play the game, that choice was taken from these young men which effected them all differently. 1) De Niro plays the idealistic character, the type who believes in things more important than hedonistic pleasure. This is why when he hunts, he uses the one bullet belief, and there is a moment between him and his prey. 2) Walken plays the agnostic type view, he neither hates nor loves the idealism of De Niro, but instead takes no stance on it at first and simply reflects on the beauty of the tree's and wondering if he is an asshole or not. 3) Steve: forget the actor's name, but he represents the boy who never really became a man, his thoughts are never deeply explored, but his actions reveal his thoughts, that he neither holds idealism or can rely strictly on self reflection and earthly delights. the effects of Gun on each: De Niro: De Niro's idealism goes out the window when presented with life or death questions, he is the closest to being a theist in his views and becomes an atheist in that murky rat filled water. We know this when he tells Walken they are going to abandon Steve. De Niro throws any sense of idealism out the window from then on out, and realizes that we cannot make and uphold our's or anyone else's "rules"... that we only have choices and reactions to our situations. De Niro's abandonment of his idealism is what saves him, and why he does not kill the deer at the end, he has learned that life it's self, or the joy of the hunt is the true purpose, and not the idealism of actually killing your prey with one shot. Walken: Walkens character at first can deal with the situation, but becomes stuck in that moment and cannot escape it. He has no idealism to loose, and now the beauty of the tree's has gone, and he has nothing left but self reflection. He cannot get past why the bullet was not in the chamber for him, and must repeat the situation until he feels he has taken control back over his life, of course he can only do this by ending his life. Steve: Steve being the eternal boy he is needs to be saved, cracks first, and is dependent on everyone else. In the end we realize our own traditions and idealism or lack there of lead us to certain points, some we can over come and some we cannot. De Niro comes out the best because he see's this and reacts to it, Walken and Steve are forever stuck in that moment. This is how the movie effected me personally.

    I want to say few words for this movie which is landmark for the end of Vietnam era. I know that it hurts for the American people to recall over and over again for this social experiment, so to call. I am not an American and if it was 40 years ago I would have never had a chance to write this review. As an Easterner we people from the Soviet bloc showed solidarity to the fight of the Vietnamese people and strangely enough I remember that some alimony and other salvation stuff was gathered from the civil population. I also know but can not support it with figures that the Warsaw Pact had sent some military force to Northern Vietnam; so it was not war America vs. Vietnam, but America vs. Vietnam plus Allies. Those are general truths and I am not withholding some state secret. Now let's talk about the movie. If it was only for the death of one of the principal actors in the film (John Cazale), that movie wouldn't have been worthy. Unfortunately, the movie received much spit from its critics and intentionally didn't received its full acclaim as first one shot at the war theater - before "Apocalypse Now" and before the Rambo series, etc. Bad luck was also that at Oscar 1979 it had to compete with another equally shattering film ("Midnight Express" - about life in Turkish prisons) which I think that is no less valuable than the Vietnamese saga, with remarkable supportive role from John Hurt. And also "Superman" (1978) was there and how is it possible not to receive a nickel. Thank you!

    It seems criminal, giving a multiple Oscar winner a negative review, yet alone an extremely loathing one. But the Academy has made some mistakes in the past in my eyes. Giving Sean Penn an Oscar nomination for I Am Sam or awarding Mel Gibson's Braveheart Best Picture. Michael Cimino's 'masterpiece' The Deer Hunter is one such example of a motion picture that gained massive praise on its original release but is, in my eyes, a dreadful hackneyed melodrama that tries to come across as meaningful and poignant when it is in reality, xenophobic, pretentious, boring and self-indulgent. It fails to be in anyway enduring nor does it make up for its three hour running length. It's honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen and even when I watched it again, I still couldn't fathom it. Three Russian-American friends, Mike, Nick and Steven, living in a small town in Pennyslvania, are about to go off to fight in Vietnam. Steven is getting married and Nick is in a loving relationship with Linda whom Mike is secretly in love with. Before heading off to fight in the war, the trio and their friends attend Steven's wedding and go off deer hunting. However, in Vietnam, they are trapped in terrible conditions as the Vietnamese endlessly torment them with games of Russian roulette. They manage to escape with Mike and Steven returning to their home with Nick staying in Saigon, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and now playing Russian roulette professionally. Steven ends up in a veteran's home whilst Mike tries to return to Saigon to save Nick as the city is about to fall to the Vietnamese. The Deer Hunter can be described as a blatant propaganda film. Cimino tries to tell the story from the perspective of the American soldiers who fight in the war and the effects of it. The Vietnamese side of the conflict is in no way explored though. They are portrayed as mindless child-killing gamblers with no remorse or mercy in their treatment of U.S soldiers. The playing Russian roulette element never occurred in the war and just appears to give the characters some traumatic experience to go through. The film comes across as a jingoistic feature that tries to appeal to the American audience. It's understandable why the film would've been critically acclaimed on its original release as America was still recovering from the war and seeing the Vietnamese as a group of sadistic monsters gave them some validity in their anger and despair. Nowadays, however, this comes across as manipulative nonsense trying to pass off as a compelling melodrama. The film feels too needlessly long at three hours and feels even longer than that. Many long films make up for their running lengths like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Seven Samurai and The Godfather Part II. But because Cimino uses an abundance of long unedited shots that should last for a few seconds, the film feels more like three days as opposed to three hours. The scene where they go hunting and annoy one of their friends by throwing his boots off the car is profoundly tedious and in no way engaging. The film also seems to want to talk about the effects of the war on American soldiers but if there is any underlying message throughout it, Cimino didn't convey it well. Maybe he felt that showing these men screaming and going hysterical would give the audience some dramatic heft to show the effects of the conflict. The film also consists of tediously repetitive dialogue with characters mumbling a bunch of crap at each other and getting drunk, singing and dancing like a bunch of idiots. The first act where the characters are all celebrating borders on boring and headache-inducing. The actors here don't do much to give their flatly written and one- dimensional characters any weight. Robert De Niro mumbles his way through the script, like a drunk. Christopher Walken just plays himself here though less entertaining than he normally is. John Savage's acting flip-flops between dull and random screaming. Meryl Streep doesn't do much with her character either to make her any identifiable. To the credit of these actors who have pretty much done great in other films, the faults mainly lie with the script and the direction and the fact that their characters barely have any personality. The Deer Hunter is one of those films that has no substance nor any dignity to accommodate the overly-long running length or even convey the effects of war properly, only by showing that it is damaging to American soldiers and it's all the Vietnamese' fault. It's a thoroughly hateful and tedious work and not something that I would like to revisit.

    This movie starts well but as soon as the protagonists get to Vietnam it just gets very - silly. The Soviets staged a walkout at the Berlin Film Festival when this was shown. I'm not surprised. The first Vietnamese depicted on the screen commits an atrocity on civilian women and children (that way we know who the baddies are). He pays for his crime, however, when the hero burns him alive - hooray! Then, all the heroes are captured by the enemy. Oh no! How could this happen? We are spared the humiliation of viewing this terrible event because next up is a hideous torture scene. Who knew that the Commies played Russian roulette with their (highly valuable) US prisoners? Never fear, the heroes kill their captors and escape! Luckily they can just float down the river to be picked up - then dropped back in the river? Oh well - back to Saigon where they are able to overcome the trauma of captivity - by playing some more Russian roulette? And so it goes until the movie ends with a rousing rendition of "God Bless America" - the US must have won the war after all! Oscars for everybody!! ** SPOILERS ** Some deer were injured in the making of this movie ** SPOILERS **

    The Deer Hunter is the type of movie that when you watch it you can't have anything else on your mind. Today's generation more often than not use their phones while they watch a movie, distracting them from the story at hand by text messages, social networking sites, and emails. When you watch The Deer Hunter, turn your phones off, put away the snacks, and empty your mind completely of any lingering predicaments they may have happened prior to sitting down to watch the film. The only way to experience The Deer Hunter is to live it. Director Michael Cimno is the showcased party from The Deer Hunter. The loose narrative allows Cimno to fully capture the characters, their struggles, and mental scarring. The script isn't cemented, which gives Cimno a lot of freedom. It's almost like we're watching a documentary of this group of people, the storytelling isn't very structured...but it works. I normally despise movies that don't get to the point they're trying to make, but The Deer Hunter struck me in a way no film of its nature has done before. It invested me into the lives of the characters, I really cared about what was going on, in a movie where not much does go on. The power Cimmo releases on the screen is admirable. The film's split into three segregated pieces: before war, during war, and after war. The Deer Hunter holds up the war to our faces and asks is this necessary? People who didn't go to war, get the point-blank experience of it through the film's gripping, raw, distressing transcendence of feelings. War changes people, we get to live that fully with The Deer Hunter. The first act, we get to know these characters as people. We identify with their day-to-day lives, living situations, and friendships. During the war, Cimno hits us with some painful scenes, including the iconic Russian Roulette sequence. It's an unforgettable, incredibly crafted scene in not just this film, but the war genre. It explores male sensitivity and the bonds that ignite in wartime. When the third act rolls around, it's about healing the scars from the war. You can see the scars every where you look. It's a catharsis of pain, loss, and mental disfigurement. Upon its release, controversy ensued due to the Russian Roulette topic covered heavily throughout the film. Apparently there was never any documented use of Russian Roulette and therefore the film was "lying" to the viewer. I dissent these accusations because The Deer Hunter isn't giving a play-by-play shot of the Vietnam war. It's main purpose is to depict the impact the war had on the men serving our country and their families. The Deer Hunter is an fictional, emotionally driven movie, not a news special describing the types of torture methods used in the war. The Deer Hunter would almost be like an acting exercise for its principle actors. Getting to live the big picture of a character, not just the crux of a story that we usually get in movies. The actors here are allowed to experiment with the characters at uninteresting moments and still create drama within those moments. When Robert De Niro puts himself in a role, he doesn't look back. De Niro's strength and susceptibility in the war scenes move your heart around in your chest. Meryl Streep gets to show off in her first meaty role, supplying each moment with a different level of emotion. Christopher Walken has the most complex character and performance; the transformation that his character lives is astounding. The actors bring this movie to life by falling back on the mission statement of the film: to show the effects of war on human beings. There's a specific technique Cimno uses with The Deer Hunter: lingering emotion. As the scene lingers on, emotion grows, and you become overwhelmed by the amount of response you feel in your heart to this film. The extreme length has been highly criticized by moviegoers, and usually I'm one of those people complaining about the unnecessary length in a movie, but here it feels right and is wonderfully fulfilling. Sure, a trim here or there wouldn't have hurt, but Cimno gets away with it because of the robust sentiment. It's a destructive piece that tears into your soul. Not having a distinctive narrative voice, the Cimno is the one who makes the movie the commanding experience that is The Deer Hunter. Some shots are so intense and violent that you shutter at the pain you're watching, but others are beautifully moving it creates a peace in our mind. Filled with numerous sublime performances, a tremendous view on war, and moving tales of the human condition, The Deer Hunter only has a few missteps along the way. You won't soon forget this film, as it will be tugging at your emotion strings long after you complete the movie. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    "The story we tell ourselves about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing, is a lie. The truth lies outside, in what we do." - Zizek A near scene-for-scene remake of 1939's "The Four Feathers", Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter" tells the story of several friends (Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken) from small town Pennsylvania. Early sequences watch as the gang work in a steel mill, congregate and go on hunting expeditions. Cimino's photography, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, is grand throughout, but the film quickly nosedives into pretentious, unintentionally funny territory. Cimino indulges in a prolonged wedding sequence (cribbed from Coppola who cribbed from Visconti), filters "Best Years of Our Lives" through a Vietnam era prism, has DeNiro run about naked like a Method Actor fishing for Oscars, and treats us to a forced sequence in which our heroes play Chopin on a piano whilst looking REALLY REALLY SERIOUS. This is a deep movie, see. The hell of Industrial America then becomes the hell of the Vietnam War. Here our heroes, now American soldiers, watch North Vietnamese savages kill civilians. They're then captured by the Vietnamese and made to play Russian Roulette. They survive this ordeal, but Walken's character is pushed into madness and begins to play Russian Roulette for money in a Saigon gambling hall. Symbolically unable to escape the damage done by Vietnam, he spends six years there, gambling with bullets. You'd think the law of averages would catch up with him, but no. "Don't leave me over there," Walken tells his buddy DeNiro, which leads to DeNiro having the longest delayed reaction in the history of cinema. Eight years later he goes back to Saigon in the hopes of finding Walken, a missing person's search which is apparently really easy. They find each other, Walken commits suicide (partially to punish - and prove his love to - "best man" DeNiro), the film ends with a funeral and a silly, unearned scene in which our gang sing "God Bless America". You can feel Cimino straining with every scene to make a GREAT EPIC. The film won five Oscars. Like most Vietnam war movies, "Hunter" hinges on romanticised madness. Deer hunting becomes a metaphor for "virtuous, humane kills" and Russian Roulette becomes a metaphor for the madness inducing chaos of Vietnam. As is typical of racist war films, the Vietnamese are portrayed as grinning (their dialogue is not even Vietnamese), Oriental savages (introduced with propagandistic scenes showing the NVA killing babies and women) and the "reason" for US defeat is sidestepped by making the Vietnam war itself incomprehensible. Where else but in an irrational country could the US lose a war? Whilst several sequences play with irony (Russian-Americans playing Russian roulette etc), Cimino's tale is one of solemn tragedy. An account of what evil, sadistic, barbaric Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans, the film, like "Apocalypse Now", oozes macho self pity with a dash of counter-culture disillusionment and strained appeals to high culture (Conrad, Eliot, Chopin songs, Orthodox hymns etc). The film is silly elsewhere, with random helicopter rescues, love triangles, many cheesy "dramatic" scenes and exploitative Roulette sequences (why's everyone in Saigaon playing Roulette?) which Cimino shoe-horned from another Las Vegas themed script he was working on. Some critics, like Jonathan Rosenbaum, spotted the film's hokiness right away. Pulitzer Prize winner Peter Arnett would call it a "simplistic lie". As with most war movies, the overriding message is "look what they did to us". Cimino perpetuates the racist stereotype that sustained much of America's involvement in Indochina, and hides behind designer madness and much irrationality. Compare to Pontecorvo's "Burn!", which offered a clear analysis of imperialist expansion, and "In the Year of the Pig" and "Hearts and Minds", two documentaries which the CIA waged war upon and whose theatres met with bomb threats. In 2012, the Pentagon began The Vietnam War Commemoration Project, a 13 year, 65 million dollar propaganda effort to clean up the image of the Vietnam war. What are they covering up? The fact that the North Vietnamese constituted a political movement with near total local, popular support, that the US artificially divided Vietnam in disregard of Geneva negotiations (becase Eisenhower knew over 80 percent of the population would vote for Ho Chi Minh), that the US put in place and backed psycho puppet leaders, that even the South didn't support the US, that the US did everything it could to prevent unification and scuttle elections, that 4 million Vietnamese died, that more bombs were dropped than in all previous wars combined, that tens of thousands were assassinated by the CIA's Phoenix Program, that nukes were threatened 13 times, that US land-mines still kill Vietnamese to this day (52000 and counting), that millions of gallons of poison, herbicide and chemicals were used, that US campaigns in Cambodia were directly responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot (himself supported with 89 million dollars) and the genocide which took place afterwards, that the first Tonkin Gulf incident was started by US aggression, that the second never happened, that over five million villagers were forcibly displaced, that political prisoners were jailed/tortured in "tiger cages" and that 90 percent of Northern levees, hospitals, villages, towns and industries were intentionally bombed. The US has similarly destabilised over 80 countries in the past 100 years. And yet here's a film with the NVA torturing small-town Americans. During and after the Iraq war, US soldiers committed suicide at a rate of 1 every 25 hours. This figure doesn't include attempted suicides (roughly 1900 in 2009 alone). In Vietnam, the number of US suicides totalled about 150,000. In real life, these vets were trapped in a double bind, unable to reconcile their belief that their conflict was righteous with their actual deeds; they thus nihilistically self-destructed. Cimino wants you to believe the opposite; that the NVA pushed men to suicide. 3/10  Depressing.

    Read the reviews by date and one can tell which generation knows war and which does not. The effects shown on the characters is what we see on returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Regardless war is still the same and has lasting effects on the participants just as this movie shows. The acting is good because they are all professionals in the true sense of the word. The script is good because all of it is true to some degree for veterans of the Vietnam debacle. the scenes are authentic-. Racist against Vietnamese-it is what it was. The film should be viewed today as a good history lesson for all. The only thing that has changed is that the steel mill has probably closed.

    The Vietnam War which lasted 15 years and ended in 1975, proved to be one of the costliest wars of our time considering its five million casualties, including the lives of over 60,000 US soldiers. Who won that war is no longer important, but the effect that war has to this day is beyond devastating. In what is easily the best and last significant film of his career, director Michael Cimino delivers a film with a prophetic vision just three years after the war ended, and is the first in a string of Vietnam war movies that is still attempted over three decades on.Having also co-written the screenplay, Cimino's story does not entirely focus on battle scenes or the war itself, but in essence, its aftermath on the lives of ordinary people. For this, his narrative spans three hours, of which the first hour is spent in impeccable character development formally introducing his Russian-American characters in a small Pennsylvanian steel-mill suburb. Mike, Nick, Steven, Stanley and John are five buddies in a typical frat-pack where after work hours are spent in male bonding activities of deer hunting and beer lounging. Their last gathering as a group is at Steven's Russian orthodox wedding reception pending Mike, Nick and Steven's enlistment in the Vietnam War. The wedding is a fun filled extravaganza where everyone has more than a good share of the festivities. Yet tell-tale signs of a devastating future are cleverly manifested through the reception, foretelling that things would never be the same again. Cut to war-torn Vietnam, Mike, Nick and Steven are POWs after a short battle sequence succumbing to North Vietnamese guerrilla tactics. Taking advantage over their captor's sadistic torture methods of Russian Roulette and rat infested imprisonment, the trio makes for a daring escape little knowing their physical and mental scars would haunt them for life. In a botched rescue attempt, their party is split and they never really regroup as before the war. Although welcomed back a hero, Mike finds it hard to adjust to his once perky lifestyle. Steven is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair living in total refusal of his family and friends. The crux of the plot surfaces when Mike goes all the way back to hellish Saigon in keeping his earlier promise where he would never leave Nick behind. What he finds is a ghastly excuse for a lifelong friend who has no recollection of their history. Worse, Nick is involved in a major gambling syndicate the likes of which still disturbs Mike: Russian roulette. Interestingly enough, Francis Ford Coppola brought out the critically acclaimed APOCALYPSE NOW just a year after this film, winning two Oscars in the process for his version of the horrifying atrocities during the war in Vietnam. Though Coppola focused mainly on the war, Cimino's film, metaphorically speaking, is an integration of three acts where graphic scenes in Vietnam form the repugnant sausage in an otherwise edible hotdog. And to think, this film was made thirty years before STOP-LOSS and HOME OF THE BRAVE, similar films about war veterans incapable of reverting to ordinary life. But Cimino had already set the tone of things to come, bagging five Academy Awards including "Best Picture" and "Best Director" out of five nominated categories. The Oscar for "Best Actor in a Supporting Role" also went to Christopher Walken for his outstanding role as Nick. Incidentally, this is Walken's first and only Oscar till date. Having secured an Oscar for his supporting role as the young Vito Corleone in Coppola's THE GODFATHER II and nominated for best supporting actor in the Martin Scorsese 1976 cult classic TAXI DRIVER, it isn't surprising that Robert De Niro was also nominated again for "Best Actor in a Leading Role" as Mike. Perhaps playing a mentally unstable Vietnam Veteran in TAXI DRIVER was all the training he required in adapting a similar themed role as the titled deer hunter. Also worth mentioning is a stunning Meryl Streep in her first ever Oscar nominated role as Linda, a passive women caught between Nick's proposal for marriage and Mike's shy charm. Also embedded in the support line up are John Savage as Steven, George Dzundza as the over eccentric John and John Cazale who passed away shortly after his role as Stanley. More than just a multi-award winning movie, this is one of De Niro's and Walken's building blocks to their currently much deserved status as Hollywood veterans. But wrapping up the perfect package goes to Cimino's credit in consideration of the lack of eye-popping special effects of Hollywood yester years. His reliance on stellar acting, perfectly timed suspense in a visionary plot and the birth of a sub-genre ahead of its time justifies why the American Film Institute has praised this film within the "100 Greatest American Movies of all time".

    In 1975, America was leaving Vietnam as the communist Southeast Asia country fell under communist control. Hollywood at the time had already made a Vietnam movie and that film was John Wayne's The Green Berets. That film became the first pro-war film about the Vietnam War. In other words, the war is good. Well, that didn't fit well with the critics. Critics in that time in 1968 wanted a serious movie about the Vietnam War. It wasn't till 1978, about 10 years later, that Hollywood made the first anti-war about the Vietnam War. That film, of course was The Deer Hunter. It told the story about three Pennsylvania steel-workers who are having the time of their lives. Among the ordinary jobs they have, they also have a wedding before they are send to Vietnam to fight. The three men are played, very through and very strong, by Robert De Niro, John Savage and Christopher Walken, who won a Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The three men leave the USA to go to Vietnam. They had no idea what kind of physical and mental destruction awaits them. The three men are forced to play Russian Roulette in a Vietcong hut. They have to survive the war and their aftermath. But, tragedy strikes and changes their lives, forever. As I said before, The Deer Hunter, has a lot of great performances by the three leading men and also, Meryl Streep, who is so effective as the role, Linda. The Deer Hunter took home 5 Oscars, including Best Picture. I felt that the movie works on character development. And, when we see the aftermath of the war, we see the aftermath of the three men. Director Michael Cimino tells this tale of war very thoroughly. Even though it runs 3 hours, it never runs out of steam. And even in the Russian Roulette scene, I felt so choked up that I felt like someone was strangling me. The suspense of that scene put me on edge. There's no doubt in my mind that The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978. After The Deer Hunter, other great Vietnam movies came along. Movies like Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July and Platoon followed. And even when The Deer Hunter was released in 1978, other films told different tales about the war. Go Tell the Spartans was another film that dealt with the topic of the Vietnam War. The Deer Hunter is a shattering, heroic and deeply effective war drama. **** 4 stars.

    Michael Cimino directs this long character study & war picture that follows a group of friends from a wedding, to a deer hunting trip, to finally the Vietnam war and its aftermath. Over three hour film details their lives before & after the war, on both the men and their families. Fine cast includes Robert De Nero, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep, who all deliver heartfelt and believable performances, but the trouble is that the extended POW sequence involving Russian Roulette just feels so bizarre and extreme, that I had a hard time buying it, especially when one of the characters becomes obsessed with it after their ordeal is over. Somehow, this drags the film down, and by the end, instead of feeling emotionally drained(like many of the audience claimed) the film felt emotionally muted, like it had gone too far afield and lost sight of what it was supposed to be about. Still, a minority view I suppose, since it did win an Academy Award for best picture and director.

    Watch this film. The film speaks to the lives we live and i think the director is making a point about free will, or the concept of it. There are choices we get to make in life, and there are situations that are thrust upon us that we have no control over. Going to Vietnam, Getting married, Being the type of hunter who is majestic and believes in a principle ( one shot ) or runs around like a sloppy drunk shooting nonsense into the air... these are the choices that we make in our life. Then there is the gun. You have no choice on if the bullet is in the chamber, or if it is not. The only choice you should have is if you play the game, that choice was taken from these young men which effected them all differently. 1) De Niro plays the idealistic character, the type who believes in things more important than hedonistic pleasure. This is why when he hunts, he uses the one bullet belief, and there is a moment between him and his prey. 2) Walken plays the agnostic type view, he neither hates nor loves the idealism of De Niro, but instead takes no stance on it at first and simply reflects on the beauty of the tree's and wondering if he is an asshole or not. 3) Steve: forget the actor's name, but he represents the boy who never really became a man, his thoughts are never deeply explored, but his actions reveal his thoughts, that he neither holds idealism or can rely strictly on self reflection and earthly delights. the effects of Gun on each: De Niro: De Niro's idealism goes out the window when presented with life or death questions, he is the closest to being a theist in his views and becomes an atheist in that murky rat filled water. We know this when he tells Walken they are going to abandon Steve. De Niro throws any sense of idealism out the window from then on out, and realizes that we cannot make and uphold our's or anyone else's "rules"... that we only have choices and reactions to our situations. De Niro's abandonment of his idealism is what saves him, and why he does not kill the deer at the end, he has learned that life it's self, or the joy of the hunt is the true purpose, and not the idealism of actually killing your prey with one shot. Walken: Walkens character at first can deal with the situation, but becomes stuck in that moment and cannot escape it. He has no idealism to loose, and now the beauty of the tree's has gone, and he has nothing left but self reflection. He cannot get past why the bullet was not in the chamber for him, and must repeat the situation until he feels he has taken control back over his life, of course he can only do this by ending his life. Steve: Steve being the eternal boy he is needs to be saved, cracks first, and is dependent on everyone else. In the end we realize our own traditions and idealism or lack there of lead us to certain points, some we can over come and some we cannot. De Niro comes out the best because he see's this and reacts to it, Walken and Steve are forever stuck in that moment. This is how the movie effected me personally.

    I want to say few words for this movie which is landmark for the end of Vietnam era. I know that it hurts for the American people to recall over and over again for this social experiment, so to call. I am not an American and if it was 40 years ago I would have never had a chance to write this review. As an Easterner we people from the Soviet bloc showed solidarity to the fight of the Vietnamese people and strangely enough I remember that some alimony and other salvation stuff was gathered from the civil population. I also know but can not support it with figures that the Warsaw Pact had sent some military force to Northern Vietnam; so it was not war America vs. Vietnam, but America vs. Vietnam plus Allies. Those are general truths and I am not withholding some state secret. Now let's talk about the movie. If it was only for the death of one of the principal actors in the film (John Cazale), that movie wouldn't have been worthy. Unfortunately, the movie received much spit from its critics and intentionally didn't received its full acclaim as first one shot at the war theater - before "Apocalypse Now" and before the Rambo series, etc. Bad luck was also that at Oscar 1979 it had to compete with another equally shattering film ("Midnight Express" - about life in Turkish prisons) which I think that is no less valuable than the Vietnamese saga, with remarkable supportive role from John Hurt. And also "Superman" (1978) was there and how is it possible not to receive a nickel. Thank you!

    It seems criminal, giving a multiple Oscar winner a negative review, yet alone an extremely loathing one. But the Academy has made some mistakes in the past in my eyes. Giving Sean Penn an Oscar nomination for I Am Sam or awarding Mel Gibson's Braveheart Best Picture. Michael Cimino's 'masterpiece' The Deer Hunter is one such example of a motion picture that gained massive praise on its original release but is, in my eyes, a dreadful hackneyed melodrama that tries to come across as meaningful and poignant when it is in reality, xenophobic, pretentious, boring and self-indulgent. It fails to be in anyway enduring nor does it make up for its three hour running length. It's honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen and even when I watched it again, I still couldn't fathom it. Three Russian-American friends, Mike, Nick and Steven, living in a small town in Pennyslvania, are about to go off to fight in Vietnam. Steven is getting married and Nick is in a loving relationship with Linda whom Mike is secretly in love with. Before heading off to fight in the war, the trio and their friends attend Steven's wedding and go off deer hunting. However, in Vietnam, they are trapped in terrible conditions as the Vietnamese endlessly torment them with games of Russian roulette. They manage to escape with Mike and Steven returning to their home with Nick staying in Saigon, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and now playing Russian roulette professionally. Steven ends up in a veteran's home whilst Mike tries to return to Saigon to save Nick as the city is about to fall to the Vietnamese. The Deer Hunter can be described as a blatant propaganda film. Cimino tries to tell the story from the perspective of the American soldiers who fight in the war and the effects of it. The Vietnamese side of the conflict is in no way explored though. They are portrayed as mindless child-killing gamblers with no remorse or mercy in their treatment of U.S soldiers. The playing Russian roulette element never occurred in the war and just appears to give the characters some traumatic experience to go through. The film comes across as a jingoistic feature that tries to appeal to the American audience. It's understandable why the film would've been critically acclaimed on its original release as America was still recovering from the war and seeing the Vietnamese as a group of sadistic monsters gave them some validity in their anger and despair. Nowadays, however, this comes across as manipulative nonsense trying to pass off as a compelling melodrama. The film feels too needlessly long at three hours and feels even longer than that. Many long films make up for their running lengths like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Seven Samurai and The Godfather Part II. But because Cimino uses an abundance of long unedited shots that should last for a few seconds, the film feels more like three days as opposed to three hours. The scene where they go hunting and annoy one of their friends by throwing his boots off the car is profoundly tedious and in no way engaging. The film also seems to want to talk about the effects of the war on American soldiers but if there is any underlying message throughout it, Cimino didn't convey it well. Maybe he felt that showing these men screaming and going hysterical would give the audience some dramatic heft to show the effects of the conflict. The film also consists of tediously repetitive dialogue with characters mumbling a bunch of crap at each other and getting drunk, singing and dancing like a bunch of idiots. The first act where the characters are all celebrating borders on boring and headache-inducing. The actors here don't do much to give their flatly written and one- dimensional characters any weight. Robert De Niro mumbles his way through the script, like a drunk. Christopher Walken just plays himself here though less entertaining than he normally is. John Savage's acting flip-flops between dull and random screaming. Meryl Streep doesn't do much with her character either to make her any identifiable. To the credit of these actors who have pretty much done great in other films, the faults mainly lie with the script and the direction and the fact that their characters barely have any personality. The Deer Hunter is one of those films that has no substance nor any dignity to accommodate the overly-long running length or even convey the effects of war properly, only by showing that it is damaging to American soldiers and it's all the Vietnamese' fault. It's a thoroughly hateful and tedious work and not something that I would like to revisit.

    This movie starts well but as soon as the protagonists get to Vietnam it just gets very - silly. The Soviets staged a walkout at the Berlin Film Festival when this was shown. I'm not surprised. The first Vietnamese depicted on the screen commits an atrocity on civilian women and children (that way we know who the baddies are). He pays for his crime, however, when the hero burns him alive - hooray! Then, all the heroes are captured by the enemy. Oh no! How could this happen? We are spared the humiliation of viewing this terrible event because next up is a hideous torture scene. Who knew that the Commies played Russian roulette with their (highly valuable) US prisoners? Never fear, the heroes kill their captors and escape! Luckily they can just float down the river to be picked up - then dropped back in the river? Oh well - back to Saigon where they are able to overcome the trauma of captivity - by playing some more Russian roulette? And so it goes until the movie ends with a rousing rendition of "God Bless America" - the US must have won the war after all! Oscars for everybody!! ** SPOILERS ** Some deer were injured in the making of this movie ** SPOILERS **

    The Deer Hunter is the type of movie that when you watch it you can't have anything else on your mind. Today's generation more often than not use their phones while they watch a movie, distracting them from the story at hand by text messages, social networking sites, and emails. When you watch The Deer Hunter, turn your phones off, put away the snacks, and empty your mind completely of any lingering predicaments they may have happened prior to sitting down to watch the film. The only way to experience The Deer Hunter is to live it. Director Michael Cimno is the showcased party from The Deer Hunter. The loose narrative allows Cimno to fully capture the characters, their struggles, and mental scarring. The script isn't cemented, which gives Cimno a lot of freedom. It's almost like we're watching a documentary of this group of people, the storytelling isn't very structured...but it works. I normally despise movies that don't get to the point they're trying to make, but The Deer Hunter struck me in a way no film of its nature has done before. It invested me into the lives of the characters, I really cared about what was going on, in a movie where not much does go on. The power Cimmo releases on the screen is admirable. The film's split into three segregated pieces: before war, during war, and after war. The Deer Hunter holds up the war to our faces and asks is this necessary? People who didn't go to war, get the point-blank experience of it through the film's gripping, raw, distressing transcendence of feelings. War changes people, we get to live that fully with The Deer Hunter. The first act, we get to know these characters as people. We identify with their day-to-day lives, living situations, and friendships. During the war, Cimno hits us with some painful scenes, including the iconic Russian Roulette sequence. It's an unforgettable, incredibly crafted scene in not just this film, but the war genre. It explores male sensitivity and the bonds that ignite in wartime. When the third act rolls around, it's about healing the scars from the war. You can see the scars every where you look. It's a catharsis of pain, loss, and mental disfigurement. Upon its release, controversy ensued due to the Russian Roulette topic covered heavily throughout the film. Apparently there was never any documented use of Russian Roulette and therefore the film was "lying" to the viewer. I dissent these accusations because The Deer Hunter isn't giving a play-by-play shot of the Vietnam war. It's main purpose is to depict the impact the war had on the men serving our country and their families. The Deer Hunter is an fictional, emotionally driven movie, not a news special describing the types of torture methods used in the war. The Deer Hunter would almost be like an acting exercise for its principle actors. Getting to live the big picture of a character, not just the crux of a story that we usually get in movies. The actors here are allowed to experiment with the characters at uninteresting moments and still create drama within those moments. When Robert De Niro puts himself in a role, he doesn't look back. De Niro's strength and susceptibility in the war scenes move your heart around in your chest. Meryl Streep gets to show off in her first meaty role, supplying each moment with a different level of emotion. Christopher Walken has the most complex character and performance; the transformation that his character lives is astounding. The actors bring this movie to life by falling back on the mission statement of the film: to show the effects of war on human beings. There's a specific technique Cimno uses with The Deer Hunter: lingering emotion. As the scene lingers on, emotion grows, and you become overwhelmed by the amount of response you feel in your heart to this film. The extreme length has been highly criticized by moviegoers, and usually I'm one of those people complaining about the unnecessary length in a movie, but here it feels right and is wonderfully fulfilling. Sure, a trim here or there wouldn't have hurt, but Cimno gets away with it because of the robust sentiment. It's a destructive piece that tears into your soul. Not having a distinctive narrative voice, the Cimno is the one who makes the movie the commanding experience that is The Deer Hunter. Some shots are so intense and violent that you shutter at the pain you're watching, but others are beautifully moving it creates a peace in our mind. Filled with numerous sublime performances, a tremendous view on war, and moving tales of the human condition, The Deer Hunter only has a few missteps along the way. You won't soon forget this film, as it will be tugging at your emotion strings long after you complete the movie. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    "The story we tell ourselves about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing, is a lie. The truth lies outside, in what we do." - Zizek A near scene-for-scene remake of 1939's "The Four Feathers", Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter" tells the story of several friends (Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken) from small town Pennsylvania. Early sequences watch as the gang work in a steel mill, congregate and go on hunting expeditions. Cimino's photography, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, is grand throughout, but the film quickly nosedives into pretentious, unintentionally funny territory. Cimino indulges in a prolonged wedding sequence (cribbed from Coppola who cribbed from Visconti), filters "Best Years of Our Lives" through a Vietnam era prism, has DeNiro run about naked like a Method Actor fishing for Oscars, and treats us to a forced sequence in which our heroes play Chopin on a piano whilst looking REALLY REALLY SERIOUS. This is a deep movie, see. The hell of Industrial America then becomes the hell of the Vietnam War. Here our heroes, now American soldiers, watch North Vietnamese savages kill civilians. They're then captured by the Vietnamese and made to play Russian Roulette. They survive this ordeal, but Walken's character is pushed into madness and begins to play Russian Roulette for money in a Saigon gambling hall. Symbolically unable to escape the damage done by Vietnam, he spends six years there, gambling with bullets. You'd think the law of averages would catch up with him, but no. "Don't leave me over there," Walken tells his buddy DeNiro, which leads to DeNiro having the longest delayed reaction in the history of cinema. Eight years later he goes back to Saigon in the hopes of finding Walken, a missing person's search which is apparently really easy. They find each other, Walken commits suicide (partially to punish - and prove his love to - "best man" DeNiro), the film ends with a funeral and a silly, unearned scene in which our gang sing "God Bless America". You can feel Cimino straining with every scene to make a GREAT EPIC. The film won five Oscars. Like most Vietnam war movies, "Hunter" hinges on romanticised madness. Deer hunting becomes a metaphor for "virtuous, humane kills" and Russian Roulette becomes a metaphor for the madness inducing chaos of Vietnam. As is typical of racist war films, the Vietnamese are portrayed as grinning (their dialogue is not even Vietnamese), Oriental savages (introduced with propagandistic scenes showing the NVA killing babies and women) and the "reason" for US defeat is sidestepped by making the Vietnam war itself incomprehensible. Where else but in an irrational country could the US lose a war? Whilst several sequences play with irony (Russian-Americans playing Russian roulette etc), Cimino's tale is one of solemn tragedy. An account of what evil, sadistic, barbaric Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans, the film, like "Apocalypse Now", oozes macho self pity with a dash of counter-culture disillusionment and strained appeals to high culture (Conrad, Eliot, Chopin songs, Orthodox hymns etc). The film is silly elsewhere, with random helicopter rescues, love triangles, many cheesy "dramatic" scenes and exploitative Roulette sequences (why's everyone in Saigaon playing Roulette?) which Cimino shoe-horned from another Las Vegas themed script he was working on. Some critics, like Jonathan Rosenbaum, spotted the film's hokiness right away. Pulitzer Prize winner Peter Arnett would call it a "simplistic lie". As with most war movies, the overriding message is "look what they did to us". Cimino perpetuates the racist stereotype that sustained much of America's involvement in Indochina, and hides behind designer madness and much irrationality. Compare to Pontecorvo's "Burn!", which offered a clear analysis of imperialist expansion, and "In the Year of the Pig" and "Hearts and Minds", two documentaries which the CIA waged war upon and whose theatres met with bomb threats. In 2012, the Pentagon began The Vietnam War Commemoration Project, a 13 year, 65 million dollar propaganda effort to clean up the image of the Vietnam war. What are they covering up? The fact that the North Vietnamese constituted a political movement with near total local, popular support, that the US artificially divided Vietnam in disregard of Geneva negotiations (becase Eisenhower knew over 80 percent of the population would vote for Ho Chi Minh), that the US put in place and backed psycho puppet leaders, that even the South didn't support the US, that the US did everything it could to prevent unification and scuttle elections, that 4 million Vietnamese died, that more bombs were dropped than in all previous wars combined, that tens of thousands were assassinated by the CIA's Phoenix Program, that nukes were threatened 13 times, that US land-mines still kill Vietnamese to this day (52000 and counting), that millions of gallons of poison, herbicide and chemicals were used, that US campaigns in Cambodia were directly responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot (himself supported with 89 million dollars) and the genocide which took place afterwards, that the first Tonkin Gulf incident was started by US aggression, that the second never happened, that over five million villagers were forcibly displaced, that political prisoners were jailed/tortured in "tiger cages" and that 90 percent of Northern levees, hospitals, villages, towns and industries were intentionally bombed. The US has similarly destabilised over 80 countries in the past 100 years. And yet here's a film with the NVA torturing small-town Americans. During and after the Iraq war, US soldiers committed suicide at a rate of 1 every 25 hours. This figure doesn't include attempted suicides (roughly 1900 in 2009 alone). In Vietnam, the number of US suicides totalled about 150,000. In real life, these vets were trapped in a double bind, unable to reconcile their belief that their conflict was righteous with their actual deeds; they thus nihilistically self-destructed. Cimino wants you to believe the opposite; that the NVA pushed men to suicide. 3/10  Depressing.

    Read the reviews by date and one can tell which generation knows war and which does not. The effects shown on the characters is what we see on returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Regardless war is still the same and has lasting effects on the participants just as this movie shows. The acting is good because they are all professionals in the true sense of the word. The script is good because all of it is true to some degree for veterans of the Vietnam debacle. the scenes are authentic-. Racist against Vietnamese-it is what it was. The film should be viewed today as a good history lesson for all. The only thing that has changed is that the steel mill has probably closed.

    The Vietnam War which lasted 15 years and ended in 1975, proved to be one of the costliest wars of our time considering its five million casualties, including the lives of over 60,000 US soldiers. Who won that war is no longer important, but the effect that war has to this day is beyond devastating. In what is easily the best and last significant film of his career, director Michael Cimino delivers a film with a prophetic vision just three years after the war ended, and is the first in a string of Vietnam war movies that is still attempted over three decades on.Having also co-written the screenplay, Cimino's story does not entirely focus on battle scenes or the war itself, but in essence, its aftermath on the lives of ordinary people. For this, his narrative spans three hours, of which the first hour is spent in impeccable character development formally introducing his Russian-American characters in a small Pennsylvanian steel-mill suburb. Mike, Nick, Steven, Stanley and John are five buddies in a typical frat-pack where after work hours are spent in male bonding activities of deer hunting and beer lounging. Their last gathering as a group is at Steven's Russian orthodox wedding reception pending Mike, Nick and Steven's enlistment in the Vietnam War. The wedding is a fun filled extravaganza where everyone has more than a good share of the festivities. Yet tell-tale signs of a devastating future are cleverly manifested through the reception, foretelling that things would never be the same again. Cut to war-torn Vietnam, Mike, Nick and Steven are POWs after a short battle sequence succumbing to North Vietnamese guerrilla tactics. Taking advantage over their captor's sadistic torture methods of Russian Roulette and rat infested imprisonment, the trio makes for a daring escape little knowing their physical and mental scars would haunt them for life. In a botched rescue attempt, their party is split and they never really regroup as before the war. Although welcomed back a hero, Mike finds it hard to adjust to his once perky lifestyle. Steven is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair living in total refusal of his family and friends. The crux of the plot surfaces when Mike goes all the way back to hellish Saigon in keeping his earlier promise where he would never leave Nick behind. What he finds is a ghastly excuse for a lifelong friend who has no recollection of their history. Worse, Nick is involved in a major gambling syndicate the likes of which still disturbs Mike: Russian roulette. Interestingly enough, Francis Ford Coppola brought out the critically acclaimed APOCALYPSE NOW just a year after this film, winning two Oscars in the process for his version of the horrifying atrocities during the war in Vietnam. Though Coppola focused mainly on the war, Cimino's film, metaphorically speaking, is an integration of three acts where graphic scenes in Vietnam form the repugnant sausage in an otherwise edible hotdog. And to think, this film was made thirty years before STOP-LOSS and HOME OF THE BRAVE, similar films about war veterans incapable of reverting to ordinary life. But Cimino had already set the tone of things to come, bagging five Academy Awards including "Best Picture" and "Best Director" out of five nominated categories. The Oscar for "Best Actor in a Supporting Role" also went to Christopher Walken for his outstanding role as Nick. Incidentally, this is Walken's first and only Oscar till date. Having secured an Oscar for his supporting role as the young Vito Corleone in Coppola's THE GODFATHER II and nominated for best supporting actor in the Martin Scorsese 1976 cult classic TAXI DRIVER, it isn't surprising that Robert De Niro was also nominated again for "Best Actor in a Leading Role" as Mike. Perhaps playing a mentally unstable Vietnam Veteran in TAXI DRIVER was all the training he required in adapting a similar themed role as the titled deer hunter. Also worth mentioning is a stunning Meryl Streep in her first ever Oscar nominated role as Linda, a passive women caught between Nick's proposal for marriage and Mike's shy charm. Also embedded in the support line up are John Savage as Steven, George Dzundza as the over eccentric John and John Cazale who passed away shortly after his role as Stanley. More than just a multi-award winning movie, this is one of De Niro's and Walken's building blocks to their currently much deserved status as Hollywood veterans. But wrapping up the perfect package goes to Cimino's credit in consideration of the lack of eye-popping special effects of Hollywood yester years. His reliance on stellar acting, perfectly timed suspense in a visionary plot and the birth of a sub-genre ahead of its time justifies why the American Film Institute has praised this film within the "100 Greatest American Movies of all time".

    In 1975, America was leaving Vietnam as the communist Southeast Asia country fell under communist control. Hollywood at the time had already made a Vietnam movie and that film was John Wayne's The Green Berets. That film became the first pro-war film about the Vietnam War. In other words, the war is good. Well, that didn't fit well with the critics. Critics in that time in 1968 wanted a serious movie about the Vietnam War. It wasn't till 1978, about 10 years later, that Hollywood made the first anti-war about the Vietnam War. That film, of course was The Deer Hunter. It told the story about three Pennsylvania steel-workers who are having the time of their lives. Among the ordinary jobs they have, they also have a wedding before they are send to Vietnam to fight. The three men are played, very through and very strong, by Robert De Niro, John Savage and Christopher Walken, who won a Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The three men leave the USA to go to Vietnam. They had no idea what kind of physical and mental destruction awaits them. The three men are forced to play Russian Roulette in a Vietcong hut. They have to survive the war and their aftermath. But, tragedy strikes and changes their lives, forever. As I said before, The Deer Hunter, has a lot of great performances by the three leading men and also, Meryl Streep, who is so effective as the role, Linda. The Deer Hunter took home 5 Oscars, including Best Picture. I felt that the movie works on character development. And, when we see the aftermath of the war, we see the aftermath of the three men. Director Michael Cimino tells this tale of war very thoroughly. Even though it runs 3 hours, it never runs out of steam. And even in the Russian Roulette scene, I felt so choked up that I felt like someone was strangling me. The suspense of that scene put me on edge. There's no doubt in my mind that The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978. After The Deer Hunter, other great Vietnam movies came along. Movies like Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July and Platoon followed. And even when The Deer Hunter was released in 1978, other films told different tales about the war. Go Tell the Spartans was another film that dealt with the topic of the Vietnam War. The Deer Hunter is a shattering, heroic and deeply effective war drama. **** 4 stars.

    Michael Cimino directs this long character study & war picture that follows a group of friends from a wedding, to a deer hunting trip, to finally the Vietnam war and its aftermath. Over three hour film details their lives before & after the war, on both the men and their families. Fine cast includes Robert De Nero, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep, who all deliver heartfelt and believable performances, but the trouble is that the extended POW sequence involving Russian Roulette just feels so bizarre and extreme, that I had a hard time buying it, especially when one of the characters becomes obsessed with it after their ordeal is over. Somehow, this drags the film down, and by the end, instead of feeling emotionally drained(like many of the audience claimed) the film felt emotionally muted, like it had gone too far afield and lost sight of what it was supposed to be about. Still, a minority view I suppose, since it did win an Academy Award for best picture and director.

    Watch this film. The film speaks to the lives we live and i think the director is making a point about free will, or the concept of it. There are choices we get to make in life, and there are situations that are thrust upon us that we have no control over. Going to Vietnam, Getting married, Being the type of hunter who is majestic and believes in a principle ( one shot ) or runs around like a sloppy drunk shooting nonsense into the air... these are the choices that we make in our life. Then there is the gun. You have no choice on if the bullet is in the chamber, or if it is not. The only choice you should have is if you play the game, that choice was taken from these young men which effected them all differently. 1) De Niro plays the idealistic character, the type who believes in things more important than hedonistic pleasure. This is why when he hunts, he uses the one bullet belief, and there is a moment between him and his prey. 2) Walken plays the agnostic type view, he neither hates nor loves the idealism of De Niro, but instead takes no stance on it at first and simply reflects on the beauty of the tree's and wondering if he is an asshole or not. 3) Steve: forget the actor's name, but he represents the boy who never really became a man, his thoughts are never deeply explored, but his actions reveal his thoughts, that he neither holds idealism or can rely strictly on self reflection and earthly delights. the effects of Gun on each: De Niro: De Niro's idealism goes out the window when presented with life or death questions, he is the closest to being a theist in his views and becomes an atheist in that murky rat filled water. We know this when he tells Walken they are going to abandon Steve. De Niro throws any sense of idealism out the window from then on out, and realizes that we cannot make and uphold our's or anyone else's "rules"... that we only have choices and reactions to our situations. De Niro's abandonment of his idealism is what saves him, and why he does not kill the deer at the end, he has learned that life it's self, or the joy of the hunt is the true purpose, and not the idealism of actually killing your prey with one shot. Walken: Walkens character at first can deal with the situation, but becomes stuck in that moment and cannot escape it. He has no idealism to loose, and now the beauty of the tree's has gone, and he has nothing left but self reflection. He cannot get past why the bullet was not in the chamber for him, and must repeat the situation until he feels he has taken control back over his life, of course he can only do this by ending his life. Steve: Steve being the eternal boy he is needs to be saved, cracks first, and is dependent on everyone else. In the end we realize our own traditions and idealism or lack there of lead us to certain points, some we can over come and some we cannot. De Niro comes out the best because he see's this and reacts to it, Walken and Steve are forever stuck in that moment. This is how the movie effected me personally.

    I want to say few words for this movie which is landmark for the end of Vietnam era. I know that it hurts for the American people to recall over and over again for this social experiment, so to call. I am not an American and if it was 40 years ago I would have never had a chance to write this review. As an Easterner we people from the Soviet bloc showed solidarity to the fight of the Vietnamese people and strangely enough I remember that some alimony and other salvation stuff was gathered from the civil population. I also know but can not support it with figures that the Warsaw Pact had sent some military force to Northern Vietnam; so it was not war America vs. Vietnam, but America vs. Vietnam plus Allies. Those are general truths and I am not withholding some state secret. Now let's talk about the movie. If it was only for the death of one of the principal actors in the film (John Cazale), that movie wouldn't have been worthy. Unfortunately, the movie received much spit from its critics and intentionally didn't received its full acclaim as first one shot at the war theater - before "Apocalypse Now" and before the Rambo series, etc. Bad luck was also that at Oscar 1979 it had to compete with another equally shattering film ("Midnight Express" - about life in Turkish prisons) which I think that is no less valuable than the Vietnamese saga, with remarkable supportive role from John Hurt. And also "Superman" (1978) was there and how is it possible not to receive a nickel. Thank you!

    It seems criminal, giving a multiple Oscar winner a negative review, yet alone an extremely loathing one. But the Academy has made some mistakes in the past in my eyes. Giving Sean Penn an Oscar nomination for I Am Sam or awarding Mel Gibson's Braveheart Best Picture. Michael Cimino's 'masterpiece' The Deer Hunter is one such example of a motion picture that gained massive praise on its original release but is, in my eyes, a dreadful hackneyed melodrama that tries to come across as meaningful and poignant when it is in reality, xenophobic, pretentious, boring and self-indulgent. It fails to be in anyway enduring nor does it make up for its three hour running length. It's honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen and even when I watched it again, I still couldn't fathom it. Three Russian-American friends, Mike, Nick and Steven, living in a small town in Pennyslvania, are about to go off to fight in Vietnam. Steven is getting married and Nick is in a loving relationship with Linda whom Mike is secretly in love with. Before heading off to fight in the war, the trio and their friends attend Steven's wedding and go off deer hunting. However, in Vietnam, they are trapped in terrible conditions as the Vietnamese endlessly torment them with games of Russian roulette. They manage to escape with Mike and Steven returning to their home with Nick staying in Saigon, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and now playing Russian roulette professionally. Steven ends up in a veteran's home whilst Mike tries to return to Saigon to save Nick as the city is about to fall to the Vietnamese. The Deer Hunter can be described as a blatant propaganda film. Cimino tries to tell the story from the perspective of the American soldiers who fight in the war and the effects of it. The Vietnamese side of the conflict is in no way explored though. They are portrayed as mindless child-killing gamblers with no remorse or mercy in their treatment of U.S soldiers. The playing Russian roulette element never occurred in the war and just appears to give the characters some traumatic experience to go through. The film comes across as a jingoistic feature that tries to appeal to the American audience. It's understandable why the film would've been critically acclaimed on its original release as America was still recovering from the war and seeing the Vietnamese as a group of sadistic monsters gave them some validity in their anger and despair. Nowadays, however, this comes across as manipulative nonsense trying to pass off as a compelling melodrama. The film feels too needlessly long at three hours and feels even longer than that. Many long films make up for their running lengths like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Seven Samurai and The Godfather Part II. But because Cimino uses an abundance of long unedited shots that should last for a few seconds, the film feels more like three days as opposed to three hours. The scene where they go hunting and annoy one of their friends by throwing his boots off the car is profoundly tedious and in no way engaging. The film also seems to want to talk about the effects of the war on American soldiers but if there is any underlying message throughout it, Cimino didn't convey it well. Maybe he felt that showing these men screaming and going hysterical would give the audience some dramatic heft to show the effects of the conflict. The film also consists of tediously repetitive dialogue with characters mumbling a bunch of crap at each other and getting drunk, singing and dancing like a bunch of idiots. The first act where the characters are all celebrating borders on boring and headache-inducing. The actors here don't do much to give their flatly written and one- dimensional characters any weight. Robert De Niro mumbles his way through the script, like a drunk. Christopher Walken just plays himself here though less entertaining than he normally is. John Savage's acting flip-flops between dull and random screaming. Meryl Streep doesn't do much with her character either to make her any identifiable. To the credit of these actors who have pretty much done great in other films, the faults mainly lie with the script and the direction and the fact that their characters barely have any personality. The Deer Hunter is one of those films that has no substance nor any dignity to accommodate the overly-long running length or even convey the effects of war properly, only by showing that it is damaging to American soldiers and it's all the Vietnamese' fault. It's a thoroughly hateful and tedious work and not something that I would like to revisit.

    This movie starts well but as soon as the protagonists get to Vietnam it just gets very - silly. The Soviets staged a walkout at the Berlin Film Festival when this was shown. I'm not surprised. The first Vietnamese depicted on the screen commits an atrocity on civilian women and children (that way we know who the baddies are). He pays for his crime, however, when the hero burns him alive - hooray! Then, all the heroes are captured by the enemy. Oh no! How could this happen? We are spared the humiliation of viewing this terrible event because next up is a hideous torture scene. Who knew that the Commies played Russian roulette with their (highly valuable) US prisoners? Never fear, the heroes kill their captors and escape! Luckily they can just float down the river to be picked up - then dropped back in the river? Oh well - back to Saigon where they are able to overcome the trauma of captivity - by playing some more Russian roulette? And so it goes until the movie ends with a rousing rendition of "God Bless America" - the US must have won the war after all! Oscars for everybody!! ** SPOILERS ** Some deer were injured in the making of this movie ** SPOILERS **

    The Deer Hunter is the type of movie that when you watch it you can't have anything else on your mind. Today's generation more often than not use their phones while they watch a movie, distracting them from the story at hand by text messages, social networking sites, and emails. When you watch The Deer Hunter, turn your phones off, put away the snacks, and empty your mind completely of any lingering predicaments they may have happened prior to sitting down to watch the film. The only way to experience The Deer Hunter is to live it. Director Michael Cimno is the showcased party from The Deer Hunter. The loose narrative allows Cimno to fully capture the characters, their struggles, and mental scarring. The script isn't cemented, which gives Cimno a lot of freedom. It's almost like we're watching a documentary of this group of people, the storytelling isn't very structured...but it works. I normally despise movies that don't get to the point they're trying to make, but The Deer Hunter struck me in a way no film of its nature has done before. It invested me into the lives of the characters, I really cared about what was going on, in a movie where not much does go on. The power Cimmo releases on the screen is admirable. The film's split into three segregated pieces: before war, during war, and after war. The Deer Hunter holds up the war to our faces and asks is this necessary? People who didn't go to war, get the point-blank experience of it through the film's gripping, raw, distressing transcendence of feelings. War changes people, we get to live that fully with The Deer Hunter. The first act, we get to know these characters as people. We identify with their day-to-day lives, living situations, and friendships. During the war, Cimno hits us with some painful scenes, including the iconic Russian Roulette sequence. It's an unforgettable, incredibly crafted scene in not just this film, but the war genre. It explores male sensitivity and the bonds that ignite in wartime. When the third act rolls around, it's about healing the scars from the war. You can see the scars every where you look. It's a catharsis of pain, loss, and mental disfigurement. Upon its release, controversy ensued due to the Russian Roulette topic covered heavily throughout the film. Apparently there was never any documented use of Russian Roulette and therefore the film was "lying" to the viewer. I dissent these accusations because The Deer Hunter isn't giving a play-by-play shot of the Vietnam war. It's main purpose is to depict the impact the war had on the men serving our country and their families. The Deer Hunter is an fictional, emotionally driven movie, not a news special describing the types of torture methods used in the war. The Deer Hunter would almost be like an acting exercise for its principle actors. Getting to live the big picture of a character, not just the crux of a story that we usually get in movies. The actors here are allowed to experiment with the characters at uninteresting moments and still create drama within those moments. When Robert De Niro puts himself in a role, he doesn't look back. De Niro's strength and susceptibility in the war scenes move your heart around in your chest. Meryl Streep gets to show off in her first meaty role, supplying each moment with a different level of emotion. Christopher Walken has the most complex character and performance; the transformation that his character lives is astounding. The actors bring this movie to life by falling back on the mission statement of the film: to show the effects of war on human beings. There's a specific technique Cimno uses with The Deer Hunter: lingering emotion. As the scene lingers on, emotion grows, and you become overwhelmed by the amount of response you feel in your heart to this film. The extreme length has been highly criticized by moviegoers, and usually I'm one of those people complaining about the unnecessary length in a movie, but here it feels right and is wonderfully fulfilling. Sure, a trim here or there wouldn't have hurt, but Cimno gets away with it because of the robust sentiment. It's a destructive piece that tears into your soul. Not having a distinctive narrative voice, the Cimno is the one who makes the movie the commanding experience that is The Deer Hunter. Some shots are so intense and violent that you shutter at the pain you're watching, but others are beautifully moving it creates a peace in our mind. Filled with numerous sublime performances, a tremendous view on war, and moving tales of the human condition, The Deer Hunter only has a few missteps along the way. You won't soon forget this film, as it will be tugging at your emotion strings long after you complete the movie. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    "The story we tell ourselves about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing, is a lie. The truth lies outside, in what we do." - Zizek A near scene-for-scene remake of 1939's "The Four Feathers", Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter" tells the story of several friends (Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken) from small town Pennsylvania. Early sequences watch as the gang work in a steel mill, congregate and go on hunting expeditions. Cimino's photography, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, is grand throughout, but the film quickly nosedives into pretentious, unintentionally funny territory. Cimino indulges in a prolonged wedding sequence (cribbed from Coppola who cribbed from Visconti), filters "Best Years of Our Lives" through a Vietnam era prism, has DeNiro run about naked like a Method Actor fishing for Oscars, and treats us to a forced sequence in which our heroes play Chopin on a piano whilst looking REALLY REALLY SERIOUS. This is a deep movie, see. The hell of Industrial America then becomes the hell of the Vietnam War. Here our heroes, now American soldiers, watch North Vietnamese savages kill civilians. They're then captured by the Vietnamese and made to play Russian Roulette. They survive this ordeal, but Walken's character is pushed into madness and begins to play Russian Roulette for money in a Saigon gambling hall. Symbolically unable to escape the damage done by Vietnam, he spends six years there, gambling with bullets. You'd think the law of averages would catch up with him, but no. "Don't leave me over there," Walken tells his buddy DeNiro, which leads to DeNiro having the longest delayed reaction in the history of cinema. Eight years later he goes back to Saigon in the hopes of finding Walken, a missing person's search which is apparently really easy. They find each other, Walken commits suicide (partially to punish - and prove his love to - "best man" DeNiro), the film ends with a funeral and a silly, unearned scene in which our gang sing "God Bless America". You can feel Cimino straining with every scene to make a GREAT EPIC. The film won five Oscars. Like most Vietnam war movies, "Hunter" hinges on romanticised madness. Deer hunting becomes a metaphor for "virtuous, humane kills" and Russian Roulette becomes a metaphor for the madness inducing chaos of Vietnam. As is typical of racist war films, the Vietnamese are portrayed as grinning (their dialogue is not even Vietnamese), Oriental savages (introduced with propagandistic scenes showing the NVA killing babies and women) and the "reason" for US defeat is sidestepped by making the Vietnam war itself incomprehensible. Where else but in an irrational country could the US lose a war? Whilst several sequences play with irony (Russian-Americans playing Russian roulette etc), Cimino's tale is one of solemn tragedy. An account of what evil, sadistic, barbaric Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans, the film, like "Apocalypse Now", oozes macho self pity with a dash of counter-culture disillusionment and strained appeals to high culture (Conrad, Eliot, Chopin songs, Orthodox hymns etc). The film is silly elsewhere, with random helicopter rescues, love triangles, many cheesy "dramatic" scenes and exploitative Roulette sequences (why's everyone in Saigaon playing Roulette?) which Cimino shoe-horned from another Las Vegas themed script he was working on. Some critics, like Jonathan Rosenbaum, spotted the film's hokiness right away. Pulitzer Prize winner Peter Arnett would call it a "simplistic lie". As with most war movies, the overriding message is "look what they did to us". Cimino perpetuates the racist stereotype that sustained much of America's involvement in Indochina, and hides behind designer madness and much irrationality. Compare to Pontecorvo's "Burn!", which offered a clear analysis of imperialist expansion, and "In the Year of the Pig" and "Hearts and Minds", two documentaries which the CIA waged war upon and whose theatres met with bomb threats. In 2012, the Pentagon began The Vietnam War Commemoration Project, a 13 year, 65 million dollar propaganda effort to clean up the image of the Vietnam war. What are they covering up? The fact that the North Vietnamese constituted a political movement with near total local, popular support, that the US artificially divided Vietnam in disregard of Geneva negotiations (becase Eisenhower knew over 80 percent of the population would vote for Ho Chi Minh), that the US put in place and backed psycho puppet leaders, that even the South didn't support the US, that the US did everything it could to prevent unification and scuttle elections, that 4 million Vietnamese died, that more bombs were dropped than in all previous wars combined, that tens of thousands were assassinated by the CIA's Phoenix Program, that nukes were threatened 13 times, that US land-mines still kill Vietnamese to this day (52000 and counting), that millions of gallons of poison, herbicide and chemicals were used, that US campaigns in Cambodia were directly responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot (himself supported with 89 million dollars) and the genocide which took place afterwards, that the first Tonkin Gulf incident was started by US aggression, that the second never happened, that over five million villagers were forcibly displaced, that political prisoners were jailed/tortured in "tiger cages" and that 90 percent of Northern levees, hospitals, villages, towns and industries were intentionally bombed. The US has similarly destabilised over 80 countries in the past 100 years. And yet here's a film with the NVA torturing small-town Americans. During and after the Iraq war, US soldiers committed suicide at a rate of 1 every 25 hours. This figure doesn't include attempted suicides (roughly 1900 in 2009 alone). In Vietnam, the number of US suicides totalled about 150,000. In real life, these vets were trapped in a double bind, unable to reconcile their belief that their conflict was righteous with their actual deeds; they thus nihilistically self-destructed. Cimino wants you to believe the opposite; that the NVA pushed men to suicide. 3/10  Depressing.

    Read the reviews by date and one can tell which generation knows war and which does not. The effects shown on the characters is what we see on returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Regardless war is still the same and has lasting effects on the participants just as this movie shows. The acting is good because they are all professionals in the true sense of the word. The script is good because all of it is true to some degree for veterans of the Vietnam debacle. the scenes are authentic-. Racist against Vietnamese-it is what it was. The film should be viewed today as a good history lesson for all. The only thing that has changed is that the steel mill has probably closed.

    The Vietnam War which lasted 15 years and ended in 1975, proved to be one of the costliest wars of our time considering its five million casualties, including the lives of over 60,000 US soldiers. Who won that war is no longer important, but the effect that war has to this day is beyond devastating. In what is easily the best and last significant film of his career, director Michael Cimino delivers a film with a prophetic vision just three years after the war ended, and is the first in a string of Vietnam war movies that is still attempted over three decades on.Having also co-written the screenplay, Cimino's story does not entirely focus on battle scenes or the war itself, but in essence, its aftermath on the lives of ordinary people. For this, his narrative spans three hours, of which the first hour is spent in impeccable character development formally introducing his Russian-American characters in a small Pennsylvanian steel-mill suburb. Mike, Nick, Steven, Stanley and John are five buddies in a typical frat-pack where after work hours are spent in male bonding activities of deer hunting and beer lounging. Their last gathering as a group is at Steven's Russian orthodox wedding reception pending Mike, Nick and Steven's enlistment in the Vietnam War. The wedding is a fun filled extravaganza where everyone has more than a good share of the festivities. Yet tell-tale signs of a devastating future are cleverly manifested through the reception, foretelling that things would never be the same again. Cut to war-torn Vietnam, Mike, Nick and Steven are POWs after a short battle sequence succumbing to North Vietnamese guerrilla tactics. Taking advantage over their captor's sadistic torture methods of Russian Roulette and rat infested imprisonment, the trio makes for a daring escape little knowing their physical and mental scars would haunt them for life. In a botched rescue attempt, their party is split and they never really regroup as before the war. Although welcomed back a hero, Mike finds it hard to adjust to his once perky lifestyle. Steven is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair living in total refusal of his family and friends. The crux of the plot surfaces when Mike goes all the way back to hellish Saigon in keeping his earlier promise where he would never leave Nick behind. What he finds is a ghastly excuse for a lifelong friend who has no recollection of their history. Worse, Nick is involved in a major gambling syndicate the likes of which still disturbs Mike: Russian roulette. Interestingly enough, Francis Ford Coppola brought out the critically acclaimed APOCALYPSE NOW just a year after this film, winning two Oscars in the process for his version of the horrifying atrocities during the war in Vietnam. Though Coppola focused mainly on the war, Cimino's film, metaphorically speaking, is an integration of three acts where graphic scenes in Vietnam form the repugnant sausage in an otherwise edible hotdog. And to think, this film was made thirty years before STOP-LOSS and HOME OF THE BRAVE, similar films about war veterans incapable of reverting to ordinary life. But Cimino had already set the tone of things to come, bagging five Academy Awards including "Best Picture" and "Best Director" out of five nominated categories. The Oscar for "Best Actor in a Supporting Role" also went to Christopher Walken for his outstanding role as Nick. Incidentally, this is Walken's first and only Oscar till date. Having secured an Oscar for his supporting role as the young Vito Corleone in Coppola's THE GODFATHER II and nominated for best supporting actor in the Martin Scorsese 1976 cult classic TAXI DRIVER, it isn't surprising that Robert De Niro was also nominated again for "Best Actor in a Leading Role" as Mike. Perhaps playing a mentally unstable Vietnam Veteran in TAXI DRIVER was all the training he required in adapting a similar themed role as the titled deer hunter. Also worth mentioning is a stunning Meryl Streep in her first ever Oscar nominated role as Linda, a passive women caught between Nick's proposal for marriage and Mike's shy charm. Also embedded in the support line up are John Savage as Steven, George Dzundza as the over eccentric John and John Cazale who passed away shortly after his role as Stanley. More than just a multi-award winning movie, this is one of De Niro's and Walken's building blocks to their currently much deserved status as Hollywood veterans. But wrapping up the perfect package goes to Cimino's credit in consideration of the lack of eye-popping special effects of Hollywood yester years. His reliance on stellar acting, perfectly timed suspense in a visionary plot and the birth of a sub-genre ahead of its time justifies why the American Film Institute has praised this film within the "100 Greatest American Movies of all time".

    In 1975, America was leaving Vietnam as the communist Southeast Asia country fell under communist control. Hollywood at the time had already made a Vietnam movie and that film was John Wayne's The Green Berets. That film became the first pro-war film about the Vietnam War. In other words, the war is good. Well, that didn't fit well with the critics. Critics in that time in 1968 wanted a serious movie about the Vietnam War. It wasn't till 1978, about 10 years later, that Hollywood made the first anti-war about the Vietnam War. That film, of course was The Deer Hunter. It told the story about three Pennsylvania steel-workers who are having the time of their lives. Among the ordinary jobs they have, they also have a wedding before they are send to Vietnam to fight. The three men are played, very through and very strong, by Robert De Niro, John Savage and Christopher Walken, who won a Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The three men leave the USA to go to Vietnam. They had no idea what kind of physical and mental destruction awaits them. The three men are forced to play Russian Roulette in a Vietcong hut. They have to survive the war and their aftermath. But, tragedy strikes and changes their lives, forever. As I said before, The Deer Hunter, has a lot of great performances by the three leading men and also, Meryl Streep, who is so effective as the role, Linda. The Deer Hunter took home 5 Oscars, including Best Picture. I felt that the movie works on character development. And, when we see the aftermath of the war, we see the aftermath of the three men. Director Michael Cimino tells this tale of war very thoroughly. Even though it runs 3 hours, it never runs out of steam. And even in the Russian Roulette scene, I felt so choked up that I felt like someone was strangling me. The suspense of that scene put me on edge. There's no doubt in my mind that The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978. After The Deer Hunter, other great Vietnam movies came along. Movies like Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July and Platoon followed. And even when The Deer Hunter was released in 1978, other films told different tales about the war. Go Tell the Spartans was another film that dealt with the topic of the Vietnam War. The Deer Hunter is a shattering, heroic and deeply effective war drama. **** 4 stars.

    Michael Cimino directs this long character study & war picture that follows a group of friends from a wedding, to a deer hunting trip, to finally the Vietnam war and its aftermath. Over three hour film details their lives before & after the war, on both the men and their families. Fine cast includes Robert De Nero, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep, who all deliver heartfelt and believable performances, but the trouble is that the extended POW sequence involving Russian Roulette just feels so bizarre and extreme, that I had a hard time buying it, especially when one of the characters becomes obsessed with it after their ordeal is over. Somehow, this drags the film down, and by the end, instead of feeling emotionally drained(like many of the audience claimed) the film felt emotionally muted, like it had gone too far afield and lost sight of what it was supposed to be about. Still, a minority view I suppose, since it did win an Academy Award for best picture and director.

    Watch this film. The film speaks to the lives we live and i think the director is making a point about free will, or the concept of it. There are choices we get to make in life, and there are situations that are thrust upon us that we have no control over. Going to Vietnam, Getting married, Being the type of hunter who is majestic and believes in a principle ( one shot ) or runs around like a sloppy drunk shooting nonsense into the air... these are the choices that we make in our life. Then there is the gun. You have no choice on if the bullet is in the chamber, or if it is not. The only choice you should have is if you play the game, that choice was taken from these young men which effected them all differently. 1) De Niro plays the idealistic character, the type who believes in things more important than hedonistic pleasure. This is why when he hunts, he uses the one bullet belief, and there is a moment between him and his prey. 2) Walken plays the agnostic type view, he neither hates nor loves the idealism of De Niro, but instead takes no stance on it at first and simply reflects on the beauty of the tree's and wondering if he is an asshole or not. 3) Steve: forget the actor's name, but he represents the boy who never really became a man, his thoughts are never deeply explored, but his actions reveal his thoughts, that he neither holds idealism or can rely strictly on self reflection and earthly delights. the effects of Gun on each: De Niro: De Niro's idealism goes out the window when presented with life or death questions, he is the closest to being a theist in his views and becomes an atheist in that murky rat filled water. We know this when he tells Walken they are going to abandon Steve. De Niro throws any sense of idealism out the window from then on out, and realizes that we cannot make and uphold our's or anyone else's "rules"... that we only have choices and reactions to our situations. De Niro's abandonment of his idealism is what saves him, and why he does not kill the deer at the end, he has learned that life it's self, or the joy of the hunt is the true purpose, and not the idealism of actually killing your prey with one shot. Walken: Walkens character at first can deal with the situation, but becomes stuck in that moment and cannot escape it. He has no idealism to loose, and now the beauty of the tree's has gone, and he has nothing left but self reflection. He cannot get past why the bullet was not in the chamber for him, and must repeat the situation until he feels he has taken control back over his life, of course he can only do this by ending his life. Steve: Steve being the eternal boy he is needs to be saved, cracks first, and is dependent on everyone else. In the end we realize our own traditions and idealism or lack there of lead us to certain points, some we can over come and some we cannot. De Niro comes out the best because he see's this and reacts to it, Walken and Steve are forever stuck in that moment. This is how the movie effected me personally.

    I want to say few words for this movie which is landmark for the end of Vietnam era. I know that it hurts for the American people to recall over and over again for this social experiment, so to call. I am not an American and if it was 40 years ago I would have never had a chance to write this review. As an Easterner we people from the Soviet bloc showed solidarity to the fight of the Vietnamese people and strangely enough I remember that some alimony and other salvation stuff was gathered from the civil population. I also know but can not support it with figures that the Warsaw Pact had sent some military force to Northern Vietnam; so it was not war America vs. Vietnam, but America vs. Vietnam plus Allies. Those are general truths and I am not withholding some state secret. Now let's talk about the movie. If it was only for the death of one of the principal actors in the film (John Cazale), that movie wouldn't have been worthy. Unfortunately, the movie received much spit from its critics and intentionally didn't received its full acclaim as first one shot at the war theater - before "Apocalypse Now" and before the Rambo series, etc. Bad luck was also that at Oscar 1979 it had to compete with another equally shattering film ("Midnight Express" - about life in Turkish prisons) which I think that is no less valuable than the Vietnamese saga, with remarkable supportive role from John Hurt. And also "Superman" (1978) was there and how is it possible not to receive a nickel. Thank you!

    It seems criminal, giving a multiple Oscar winner a negative review, yet alone an extremely loathing one. But the Academy has made some mistakes in the past in my eyes. Giving Sean Penn an Oscar nomination for I Am Sam or awarding Mel Gibson's Braveheart Best Picture. Michael Cimino's 'masterpiece' The Deer Hunter is one such example of a motion picture that gained massive praise on its original release but is, in my eyes, a dreadful hackneyed melodrama that tries to come across as meaningful and poignant when it is in reality, xenophobic, pretentious, boring and self-indulgent. It fails to be in anyway enduring nor does it make up for its three hour running length. It's honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen and even when I watched it again, I still couldn't fathom it. Three Russian-American friends, Mike, Nick and Steven, living in a small town in Pennyslvania, are about to go off to fight in Vietnam. Steven is getting married and Nick is in a loving relationship with Linda whom Mike is secretly in love with. Before heading off to fight in the war, the trio and their friends attend Steven's wedding and go off deer hunting. However, in Vietnam, they are trapped in terrible conditions as the Vietnamese endlessly torment them with games of Russian roulette. They manage to escape with Mike and Steven returning to their home with Nick staying in Saigon, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and now playing Russian roulette professionally. Steven ends up in a veteran's home whilst Mike tries to return to Saigon to save Nick as the city is about to fall to the Vietnamese. The Deer Hunter can be described as a blatant propaganda film. Cimino tries to tell the story from the perspective of the American soldiers who fight in the war and the effects of it. The Vietnamese side of the conflict is in no way explored though. They are portrayed as mindless child-killing gamblers with no remorse or mercy in their treatment of U.S soldiers. The playing Russian roulette element never occurred in the war and just appears to give the characters some traumatic experience to go through. The film comes across as a jingoistic feature that tries to appeal to the American audience. It's understandable why the film would've been critically acclaimed on its original release as America was still recovering from the war and seeing the Vietnamese as a group of sadistic monsters gave them some validity in their anger and despair. Nowadays, however, this comes across as manipulative nonsense trying to pass off as a compelling melodrama. The film feels too needlessly long at three hours and feels even longer than that. Many long films make up for their running lengths like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Seven Samurai and The Godfather Part II. But because Cimino uses an abundance of long unedited shots that should last for a few seconds, the film feels more like three days as opposed to three hours. The scene where they go hunting and annoy one of their friends by throwing his boots off the car is profoundly tedious and in no way engaging. The film also seems to want to talk about the effects of the war on American soldiers but if there is any underlying message throughout it, Cimino didn't convey it well. Maybe he felt that showing these men screaming and going hysterical would give the audience some dramatic heft to show the effects of the conflict. The film also consists of tediously repetitive dialogue with characters mumbling a bunch of crap at each other and getting drunk, singing and dancing like a bunch of idiots. The first act where the characters are all celebrating borders on boring and headache-inducing. The actors here don't do much to give their flatly written and one- dimensional characters any weight. Robert De Niro mumbles his way through the script, like a drunk. Christopher Walken just plays himself here though less entertaining than he normally is. John Savage's acting flip-flops between dull and random screaming. Meryl Streep doesn't do much with her character either to make her any identifiable. To the credit of these actors who have pretty much done great in other films, the faults mainly lie with the script and the direction and the fact that their characters barely have any personality. The Deer Hunter is one of those films that has no substance nor any dignity to accommodate the overly-long running length or even convey the effects of war properly, only by showing that it is damaging to American soldiers and it's all the Vietnamese' fault. It's a thoroughly hateful and tedious work and not something that I would like to revisit.

    This movie starts well but as soon as the protagonists get to Vietnam it just gets very - silly. The Soviets staged a walkout at the Berlin Film Festival when this was shown. I'm not surprised. The first Vietnamese depicted on the screen commits an atrocity on civilian women and children (that way we know who the baddies are). He pays for his crime, however, when the hero burns him alive - hooray! Then, all the heroes are captured by the enemy. Oh no! How could this happen? We are spared the humiliation of viewing this terrible event because next up is a hideous torture scene. Who knew that the Commies played Russian roulette with their (highly valuable) US prisoners? Never fear, the heroes kill their captors and escape! Luckily they can just float down the river to be picked up - then dropped back in the river? Oh well - back to Saigon where they are able to overcome the trauma of captivity - by playing some more Russian roulette? And so it goes until the movie ends with a rousing rendition of "God Bless America" - the US must have won the war after all! Oscars for everybody!! ** SPOILERS ** Some deer were injured in the making of this movie ** SPOILERS **

    The Deer Hunter is the type of movie that when you watch it you can't have anything else on your mind. Today's generation more often than not use their phones while they watch a movie, distracting them from the story at hand by text messages, social networking sites, and emails. When you watch The Deer Hunter, turn your phones off, put away the snacks, and empty your mind completely of any lingering predicaments they may have happened prior to sitting down to watch the film. The only way to experience The Deer Hunter is to live it. Director Michael Cimno is the showcased party from The Deer Hunter. The loose narrative allows Cimno to fully capture the characters, their struggles, and mental scarring. The script isn't cemented, which gives Cimno a lot of freedom. It's almost like we're watching a documentary of this group of people, the storytelling isn't very structured...but it works. I normally despise movies that don't get to the point they're trying to make, but The Deer Hunter struck me in a way no film of its nature has done before. It invested me into the lives of the characters, I really cared about what was going on, in a movie where not much does go on. The power Cimmo releases on the screen is admirable. The film's split into three segregated pieces: before war, during war, and after war. The Deer Hunter holds up the war to our faces and asks is this necessary? People who didn't go to war, get the point-blank experience of it through the film's gripping, raw, distressing transcendence of feelings. War changes people, we get to live that fully with The Deer Hunter. The first act, we get to know these characters as people. We identify with their day-to-day lives, living situations, and friendships. During the war, Cimno hits us with some painful scenes, including the iconic Russian Roulette sequence. It's an unforgettable, incredibly crafted scene in not just this film, but the war genre. It explores male sensitivity and the bonds that ignite in wartime. When the third act rolls around, it's about healing the scars from the war. You can see the scars every where you look. It's a catharsis of pain, loss, and mental disfigurement. Upon its release, controversy ensued due to the Russian Roulette topic covered heavily throughout the film. Apparently there was never any documented use of Russian Roulette and therefore the film was "lying" to the viewer. I dissent these accusations because The Deer Hunter isn't giving a play-by-play shot of the Vietnam war. It's main purpose is to depict the impact the war had on the men serving our country and their families. The Deer Hunter is an fictional, emotionally driven movie, not a news special describing the types of torture methods used in the war. The Deer Hunter would almost be like an acting exercise for its principle actors. Getting to live the big picture of a character, not just the crux of a story that we usually get in movies. The actors here are allowed to experiment with the characters at uninteresting moments and still create drama within those moments. When Robert De Niro puts himself in a role, he doesn't look back. De Niro's strength and susceptibility in the war scenes move your heart around in your chest. Meryl Streep gets to show off in her first meaty role, supplying each moment with a different level of emotion. Christopher Walken has the most complex character and performance; the transformation that his character lives is astounding. The actors bring this movie to life by falling back on the mission statement of the film: to show the effects of war on human beings. There's a specific technique Cimno uses with The Deer Hunter: lingering emotion. As the scene lingers on, emotion grows, and you become overwhelmed by the amount of response you feel in your heart to this film. The extreme length has been highly criticized by moviegoers, and usually I'm one of those people complaining about the unnecessary length in a movie, but here it feels right and is wonderfully fulfilling. Sure, a trim here or there wouldn't have hurt, but Cimno gets away with it because of the robust sentiment. It's a destructive piece that tears into your soul. Not having a distinctive narrative voice, the Cimno is the one who makes the movie the commanding experience that is The Deer Hunter. Some shots are so intense and violent that you shutter at the pain you're watching, but others are beautifully moving it creates a peace in our mind. Filled with numerous sublime performances, a tremendous view on war, and moving tales of the human condition, The Deer Hunter only has a few missteps along the way. You won't soon forget this film, as it will be tugging at your emotion strings long after you complete the movie. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    "The story we tell ourselves about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing, is a lie. The truth lies outside, in what we do." - Zizek A near scene-for-scene remake of 1939's "The Four Feathers", Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter" tells the story of several friends (Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken) from small town Pennsylvania. Early sequences watch as the gang work in a steel mill, congregate and go on hunting expeditions. Cimino's photography, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, is grand throughout, but the film quickly nosedives into pretentious, unintentionally funny territory. Cimino indulges in a prolonged wedding sequence (cribbed from Coppola who cribbed from Visconti), filters "Best Years of Our Lives" through a Vietnam era prism, has DeNiro run about naked like a Method Actor fishing for Oscars, and treats us to a forced sequence in which our heroes play Chopin on a piano whilst looking REALLY REALLY SERIOUS. This is a deep movie, see. The hell of Industrial America then becomes the hell of the Vietnam War. Here our heroes, now American soldiers, watch North Vietnamese savages kill civilians. They're then captured by the Vietnamese and made to play Russian Roulette. They survive this ordeal, but Walken's character is pushed into madness and begins to play Russian Roulette for money in a Saigon gambling hall. Symbolically unable to escape the damage done by Vietnam, he spends six years there, gambling with bullets. You'd think the law of averages would catch up with him, but no. "Don't leave me over there," Walken tells his buddy DeNiro, which leads to DeNiro having the longest delayed reaction in the history of cinema. Eight years later he goes back to Saigon in the hopes of finding Walken, a missing person's search which is apparently really easy. They find each other, Walken commits suicide (partially to punish - and prove his love to - "best man" DeNiro), the film ends with a funeral and a silly, unearned scene in which our gang sing "God Bless America". You can feel Cimino straining with every scene to make a GREAT EPIC. The film won five Oscars. Like most Vietnam war movies, "Hunter" hinges on romanticised madness. Deer hunting becomes a metaphor for "virtuous, humane kills" and Russian Roulette becomes a metaphor for the madness inducing chaos of Vietnam. As is typical of racist war films, the Vietnamese are portrayed as grinning (their dialogue is not even Vietnamese), Oriental savages (introduced with propagandistic scenes showing the NVA killing babies and women) and the "reason" for US defeat is sidestepped by making the Vietnam war itself incomprehensible. Where else but in an irrational country could the US lose a war? Whilst several sequences play with irony (Russian-Americans playing Russian roulette etc), Cimino's tale is one of solemn tragedy. An account of what evil, sadistic, barbaric Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans, the film, like "Apocalypse Now", oozes macho self pity with a dash of counter-culture disillusionment and strained appeals to high culture (Conrad, Eliot, Chopin songs, Orthodox hymns etc). The film is silly elsewhere, with random helicopter rescues, love triangles, many cheesy "dramatic" scenes and exploitative Roulette sequences (why's everyone in Saigaon playing Roulette?) which Cimino shoe-horned from another Las Vegas themed script he was working on. Some critics, like Jonathan Rosenbaum, spotted the film's hokiness right away. Pulitzer Prize winner Peter Arnett would call it a "simplistic lie". As with most war movies, the overriding message is "look what they did to us". Cimino perpetuates the racist stereotype that sustained much of America's involvement in Indochina, and hides behind designer madness and much irrationality. Compare to Pontecorvo's "Burn!", which offered a clear analysis of imperialist expansion, and "In the Year of the Pig" and "Hearts and Minds", two documentaries which the CIA waged war upon and whose theatres met with bomb threats. In 2012, the Pentagon began The Vietnam War Commemoration Project, a 13 year, 65 million dollar propaganda effort to clean up the image of the Vietnam war. What are they covering up? The fact that the North Vietnamese constituted a political movement with near total local, popular support, that the US artificially divided Vietnam in disregard of Geneva negotiations (becase Eisenhower knew over 80 percent of the population would vote for Ho Chi Minh), that the US put in place and backed psycho puppet leaders, that even the South didn't support the US, that the US did everything it could to prevent unification and scuttle elections, that 4 million Vietnamese died, that more bombs were dropped than in all previous wars combined, that tens of thousands were assassinated by the CIA's Phoenix Program, that nukes were threatened 13 times, that US land-mines still kill Vietnamese to this day (52000 and counting), that millions of gallons of poison, herbicide and chemicals were used, that US campaigns in Cambodia were directly responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot (himself supported with 89 million dollars) and the genocide which took place afterwards, that the first Tonkin Gulf incident was started by US aggression, that the second never happened, that over five million villagers were forcibly displaced, that political prisoners were jailed/tortured in "tiger cages" and that 90 percent of Northern levees, hospitals, villages, towns and industries were intentionally bombed. The US has similarly destabilised over 80 countries in the past 100 years. And yet here's a film with the NVA torturing small-town Americans. During and after the Iraq war, US soldiers committed suicide at a rate of 1 every 25 hours. This figure doesn't include attempted suicides (roughly 1900 in 2009 alone). In Vietnam, the number of US suicides totalled about 150,000. In real life, these vets were trapped in a double bind, unable to reconcile their belief that their conflict was righteous with their actual deeds; they thus nihilistically self-destructed. Cimino wants you to believe the opposite; that the NVA pushed men to suicide. 3/10  Depressing.

    Read the reviews by date and one can tell which generation knows war and which does not. The effects shown on the characters is what we see on returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Regardless war is still the same and has lasting effects on the participants just as this movie shows. The acting is good because they are all professionals in the true sense of the word. The script is good because all of it is true to some degree for veterans of the Vietnam debacle. the scenes are authentic-. Racist against Vietnamese-it is what it was. The film should be viewed today as a good history lesson for all. The only thing that has changed is that the steel mill has probably closed.

    The Vietnam War which lasted 15 years and ended in 1975, proved to be one of the costliest wars of our time considering its five million casualties, including the lives of over 60,000 US soldiers. Who won that war is no longer important, but the effect that war has to this day is beyond devastating. In what is easily the best and last significant film of his career, director Michael Cimino delivers a film with a prophetic vision just three years after the war ended, and is the first in a string of Vietnam war movies that is still attempted over three decades on.Having also co-written the screenplay, Cimino's story does not entirely focus on battle scenes or the war itself, but in essence, its aftermath on the lives of ordinary people. For this, his narrative spans three hours, of which the first hour is spent in impeccable character development formally introducing his Russian-American characters in a small Pennsylvanian steel-mill suburb. Mike, Nick, Steven, Stanley and John are five buddies in a typical frat-pack where after work hours are spent in male bonding activities of deer hunting and beer lounging. Their last gathering as a group is at Steven's Russian orthodox wedding reception pending Mike, Nick and Steven's enlistment in the Vietnam War. The wedding is a fun filled extravaganza where everyone has more than a good share of the festivities. Yet tell-tale signs of a devastating future are cleverly manifested through the reception, foretelling that things would never be the same again. Cut to war-torn Vietnam, Mike, Nick and Steven are POWs after a short battle sequence succumbing to North Vietnamese guerrilla tactics. Taking advantage over their captor's sadistic torture methods of Russian Roulette and rat infested imprisonment, the trio makes for a daring escape little knowing their physical and mental scars would haunt them for life. In a botched rescue attempt, their party is split and they never really regroup as before the war. Although welcomed back a hero, Mike finds it hard to adjust to his once perky lifestyle. Steven is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair living in total refusal of his family and friends. The crux of the plot surfaces when Mike goes all the way back to hellish Saigon in keeping his earlier promise where he would never leave Nick behind. What he finds is a ghastly excuse for a lifelong friend who has no recollection of their history. Worse, Nick is involved in a major gambling syndicate the likes of which still disturbs Mike: Russian roulette. Interestingly enough, Francis Ford Coppola brought out the critically acclaimed APOCALYPSE NOW just a year after this film, winning two Oscars in the process for his version of the horrifying atrocities during the war in Vietnam. Though Coppola focused mainly on the war, Cimino's film, metaphorically speaking, is an integration of three acts where graphic scenes in Vietnam form the repugnant sausage in an otherwise edible hotdog. And to think, this film was made thirty years before STOP-LOSS and HOME OF THE BRAVE, similar films about war veterans incapable of reverting to ordinary life. But Cimino had already set the tone of things to come, bagging five Academy Awards including "Best Picture" and "Best Director" out of five nominated categories. The Oscar for "Best Actor in a Supporting Role" also went to Christopher Walken for his outstanding role as Nick. Incidentally, this is Walken's first and only Oscar till date. Having secured an Oscar for his supporting role as the young Vito Corleone in Coppola's THE GODFATHER II and nominated for best supporting actor in the Martin Scorsese 1976 cult classic TAXI DRIVER, it isn't surprising that Robert De Niro was also nominated again for "Best Actor in a Leading Role" as Mike. Perhaps playing a mentally unstable Vietnam Veteran in TAXI DRIVER was all the training he required in adapting a similar themed role as the titled deer hunter. Also worth mentioning is a stunning Meryl Streep in her first ever Oscar nominated role as Linda, a passive women caught between Nick's proposal for marriage and Mike's shy charm. Also embedded in the support line up are John Savage as Steven, George Dzundza as the over eccentric John and John Cazale who passed away shortly after his role as Stanley. More than just a multi-award winning movie, this is one of De Niro's and Walken's building blocks to their currently much deserved status as Hollywood veterans. But wrapping up the perfect package goes to Cimino's credit in consideration of the lack of eye-popping special effects of Hollywood yester years. His reliance on stellar acting, perfectly timed suspense in a visionary plot and the birth of a sub-genre ahead of its time justifies why the American Film Institute has praised this film within the "100 Greatest American Movies of all time".

    In 1975, America was leaving Vietnam as the communist Southeast Asia country fell under communist control. Hollywood at the time had already made a Vietnam movie and that film was John Wayne's The Green Berets. That film became the first pro-war film about the Vietnam War. In other words, the war is good. Well, that didn't fit well with the critics. Critics in that time in 1968 wanted a serious movie about the Vietnam War. It wasn't till 1978, about 10 years later, that Hollywood made the first anti-war about the Vietnam War. That film, of course was The Deer Hunter. It told the story about three Pennsylvania steel-workers who are having the time of their lives. Among the ordinary jobs they have, they also have a wedding before they are send to Vietnam to fight. The three men are played, very through and very strong, by Robert De Niro, John Savage and Christopher Walken, who won a Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The three men leave the USA to go to Vietnam. They had no idea what kind of physical and mental destruction awaits them. The three men are forced to play Russian Roulette in a Vietcong hut. They have to survive the war and their aftermath. But, tragedy strikes and changes their lives, forever. As I said before, The Deer Hunter, has a lot of great performances by the three leading men and also, Meryl Streep, who is so effective as the role, Linda. The Deer Hunter took home 5 Oscars, including Best Picture. I felt that the movie works on character development. And, when we see the aftermath of the war, we see the aftermath of the three men. Director Michael Cimino tells this tale of war very thoroughly. Even though it runs 3 hours, it never runs out of steam. And even in the Russian Roulette scene, I felt so choked up that I felt like someone was strangling me. The suspense of that scene put me on edge. There's no doubt in my mind that The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978. After The Deer Hunter, other great Vietnam movies came along. Movies like Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July and Platoon followed. And even when The Deer Hunter was released in 1978, other films told different tales about the war. Go Tell the Spartans was another film that dealt with the topic of the Vietnam War. The Deer Hunter is a shattering, heroic and deeply effective war drama. **** 4 stars.

Then there is the gun. You have no choice on if the bullet is in the chamber, or if it is not. The only choice you should have is if you play the game, that choice was taken from these young men which effected them all differently. 1) De Niro plays the idealistic character, the type who believes in things more important than hedonistic pleasure. This is why when he hunts, he uses the one bullet belief, and there is a moment between him and his prey. 2) Walken plays the agnostic type view, he neither hates nor loves the idealism of De Niro, but instead takes no stance on it at first and simply reflects on the beauty of the tree's and wondering if he is an asshole or not. 3) Steve: forget the actor's name, but he represents the boy who never really became a man, his thoughts are never deeply explored, but his actions reveal his thoughts, that he neither holds idealism or can rely strictly on self reflection and earthly delights. the effects of Gun on each: De Niro: De Niro's idealism goes out the window when presented with life or death questions, he is the closest to being a theist in his views and becomes an atheist in that murky rat filled water. We know this when he tells Walken they are going to abandon Steve. De Niro throws any sense of idealism out the window from then on out, and realizes that we cannot make and uphold our's or anyone else's "rules"... that we only have choices and reactions to our situations. De Niro's abandonment of his idealism is what saves him, and why he does not kill the deer at the end, he has learned that life it's self, or the joy of the hunt is the true purpose, and not the idealism of actually killing your prey with one shot. Walken: Walkens character at first can deal with the situation, but becomes stuck in that moment and cannot escape it. He has no idealism to loose, and now the beauty of the tree's has gone, and he has nothing left but self reflection. He cannot get past why the bullet was not in the chamber for him, and must repeat the situation until he feels he has taken control back over his life, of course he can only do this by ending his life. Steve: Steve being the eternal boy he is needs to be saved, cracks first, and is dependent on everyone else. In the end we realize our own traditions and idealism or lack there of lead us to certain points, some we can over come and some we cannot. De Niro comes out the best because he see's this and reacts to it, Walken and Steve are forever stuck in that moment. This is how the movie effected me personally.

    I want to say few words for this movie which is landmark for the end of Vietnam era. I know that it hurts for the American people to recall over and over again for this social experiment, so to call. I am not an American and if it was 40 years ago I would have never had a chance to write this review. As an Easterner we people from the Soviet bloc showed solidarity to the fight of the Vietnamese people and strangely enough I remember that some alimony and other salvation stuff was gathered from the civil population. I also know but can not support it with figures that the Warsaw Pact had sent some military force to Northern Vietnam; so it was not war America vs. Vietnam, but America vs. Vietnam plus Allies. Those are general truths and I am not withholding some state secret. Now let's talk about the movie. If it was only for the death of one of the principal actors in the film (John Cazale), that movie wouldn't have been worthy. Unfortunately, the movie received much spit from its critics and intentionally didn't received its full acclaim as first one shot at the war theater - before "Apocalypse Now" and before the Rambo series, etc. Bad luck was also that at Oscar 1979 it had to compete with another equally shattering film ("Midnight Express" - about life in Turkish prisons) which I think that is no less valuable than the Vietnamese saga, with remarkable supportive role from John Hurt. And also "Superman" (1978) was there and how is it possible not to receive a nickel. Thank you!

    It seems criminal, giving a multiple Oscar winner a negative review, yet alone an extremely loathing one. But the Academy has made some mistakes in the past in my eyes. Giving Sean Penn an Oscar nomination for I Am Sam or awarding Mel Gibson's Braveheart Best Picture. Michael Cimino's 'masterpiece' The Deer Hunter is one such example of a motion picture that gained massive praise on its original release but is, in my eyes, a dreadful hackneyed melodrama that tries to come across as meaningful and poignant when it is in reality, xenophobic, pretentious, boring and self-indulgent. It fails to be in anyway enduring nor does it make up for its three hour running length. It's honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen and even when I watched it again, I still couldn't fathom it. Three Russian-American friends, Mike, Nick and Steven, living in a small town in Pennyslvania, are about to go off to fight in Vietnam. Steven is getting married and Nick is in a loving relationship with Linda whom Mike is secretly in love with. Before heading off to fight in the war, the trio and their friends attend Steven's wedding and go off deer hunting. However, in Vietnam, they are trapped in terrible conditions as the Vietnamese endlessly torment them with games of Russian roulette. They manage to escape with Mike and Steven returning to their home with Nick staying in Saigon, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and now playing Russian roulette professionally. Steven ends up in a veteran's home whilst Mike tries to return to Saigon to save Nick as the city is about to fall to the Vietnamese. The Deer Hunter can be described as a blatant propaganda film. Cimino tries to tell the story from the perspective of the American soldiers who fight in the war and the effects of it. The Vietnamese side of the conflict is in no way explored though. They are portrayed as mindless child-killing gamblers with no remorse or mercy in their treatment of U.S soldiers. The playing Russian roulette element never occurred in the war and just appears to give the characters some traumatic experience to go through. The film comes across as a jingoistic feature that tries to appeal to the American audience. It's understandable why the film would've been critically acclaimed on its original release as America was still recovering from the war and seeing the Vietnamese as a group of sadistic monsters gave them some validity in their anger and despair. Nowadays, however, this comes across as manipulative nonsense trying to pass off as a compelling melodrama. The film feels too needlessly long at three hours and feels even longer than that. Many long films make up for their running lengths like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Seven Samurai and The Godfather Part II. But because Cimino uses an abundance of long unedited shots that should last for a few seconds, the film feels more like three days as opposed to three hours. The scene where they go hunting and annoy one of their friends by throwing his boots off the car is profoundly tedious and in no way engaging. The film also seems to want to talk about the effects of the war on American soldiers but if there is any underlying message throughout it, Cimino didn't convey it well. Maybe he felt that showing these men screaming and going hysterical would give the audience some dramatic heft to show the effects of the conflict. The film also consists of tediously repetitive dialogue with characters mumbling a bunch of crap at each other and getting drunk, singing and dancing like a bunch of idiots. The first act where the characters are all celebrating borders on boring and headache-inducing. The actors here don't do much to give their flatly written and one- dimensional characters any weight. Robert De Niro mumbles his way through the script, like a drunk. Christopher Walken just plays himself here though less entertaining than he normally is. John Savage's acting flip-flops between dull and random screaming. Meryl Streep doesn't do much with her character either to make her any identifiable. To the credit of these actors who have pretty much done great in other films, the faults mainly lie with the script and the direction and the fact that their characters barely have any personality. The Deer Hunter is one of those films that has no substance nor any dignity to accommodate the overly-long running length or even convey the effects of war properly, only by showing that it is damaging to American soldiers and it's all the Vietnamese' fault. It's a thoroughly hateful and tedious work and not something that I would like to revisit.

    This movie starts well but as soon as the protagonists get to Vietnam it just gets very - silly. The Soviets staged a walkout at the Berlin Film Festival when this was shown. I'm not surprised. The first Vietnamese depicted on the screen commits an atrocity on civilian women and children (that way we know who the baddies are). He pays for his crime, however, when the hero burns him alive - hooray! Then, all the heroes are captured by the enemy. Oh no! How could this happen? We are spared the humiliation of viewing this terrible event because next up is a hideous torture scene. Who knew that the Commies played Russian roulette with their (highly valuable) US prisoners? Never fear, the heroes kill their captors and escape! Luckily they can just float down the river to be picked up - then dropped back in the river? Oh well - back to Saigon where they are able to overcome the trauma of captivity - by playing some more Russian roulette? And so it goes until the movie ends with a rousing rendition of "God Bless America" - the US must have won the war after all! Oscars for everybody!! ** SPOILERS ** Some deer were injured in the making of this movie ** SPOILERS **

    The Deer Hunter is the type of movie that when you watch it you can't have anything else on your mind. Today's generation more often than not use their phones while they watch a movie, distracting them from the story at hand by text messages, social networking sites, and emails. When you watch The Deer Hunter, turn your phones off, put away the snacks, and empty your mind completely of any lingering predicaments they may have happened prior to sitting down to watch the film. The only way to experience The Deer Hunter is to live it. Director Michael Cimno is the showcased party from The Deer Hunter. The loose narrative allows Cimno to fully capture the characters, their struggles, and mental scarring. The script isn't cemented, which gives Cimno a lot of freedom. It's almost like we're watching a documentary of this group of people, the storytelling isn't very structured...but it works. I normally despise movies that don't get to the point they're trying to make, but The Deer Hunter struck me in a way no film of its nature has done before. It invested me into the lives of the characters, I really cared about what was going on, in a movie where not much does go on. The power Cimmo releases on the screen is admirable. The film's split into three segregated pieces: before war, during war, and after war. The Deer Hunter holds up the war to our faces and asks is this necessary? People who didn't go to war, get the point-blank experience of it through the film's gripping, raw, distressing transcendence of feelings. War changes people, we get to live that fully with The Deer Hunter. The first act, we get to know these characters as people. We identify with their day-to-day lives, living situations, and friendships. During the war, Cimno hits us with some painful scenes, including the iconic Russian Roulette sequence. It's an unforgettable, incredibly crafted scene in not just this film, but the war genre. It explores male sensitivity and the bonds that ignite in wartime. When the third act rolls around, it's about healing the scars from the war. You can see the scars every where you look. It's a catharsis of pain, loss, and mental disfigurement. Upon its release, controversy ensued due to the Russian Roulette topic covered heavily throughout the film. Apparently there was never any documented use of Russian Roulette and therefore the film was "lying" to the viewer. I dissent these accusations because The Deer Hunter isn't giving a play-by-play shot of the Vietnam war. It's main purpose is to depict the impact the war had on the men serving our country and their families. The Deer Hunter is an fictional, emotionally driven movie, not a news special describing the types of torture methods used in the war. The Deer Hunter would almost be like an acting exercise for its principle actors. Getting to live the big picture of a character, not just the crux of a story that we usually get in movies. The actors here are allowed to experiment with the characters at uninteresting moments and still create drama within those moments. When Robert De Niro puts himself in a role, he doesn't look back. De Niro's strength and susceptibility in the war scenes move your heart around in your chest. Meryl Streep gets to show off in her first meaty role, supplying each moment with a different level of emotion. Christopher Walken has the most complex character and performance; the transformation that his character lives is astounding. The actors bring this movie to life by falling back on the mission statement of the film: to show the effects of war on human beings. There's a specific technique Cimno uses with The Deer Hunter: lingering emotion. As the scene lingers on, emotion grows, and you become overwhelmed by the amount of response you feel in your heart to this film. The extreme length has been highly criticized by moviegoers, and usually I'm one of those people complaining about the unnecessary length in a movie, but here it feels right and is wonderfully fulfilling. Sure, a trim here or there wouldn't have hurt, but Cimno gets away with it because of the robust sentiment. It's a destructive piece that tears into your soul. Not having a distinctive narrative voice, the Cimno is the one who makes the movie the commanding experience that is The Deer Hunter. Some shots are so intense and violent that you shutter at the pain you're watching, but others are beautifully moving it creates a peace in our mind. Filled with numerous sublime performances, a tremendous view on war, and moving tales of the human condition, The Deer Hunter only has a few missteps along the way. You won't soon forget this film, as it will be tugging at your emotion strings long after you complete the movie. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    "The story we tell ourselves about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing, is a lie. The truth lies outside, in what we do." - Zizek A near scene-for-scene remake of 1939's "The Four Feathers", Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter" tells the story of several friends (Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken) from small town Pennsylvania. Early sequences watch as the gang work in a steel mill, congregate and go on hunting expeditions. Cimino's photography, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, is grand throughout, but the film quickly nosedives into pretentious, unintentionally funny territory. Cimino indulges in a prolonged wedding sequence (cribbed from Coppola who cribbed from Visconti), filters "Best Years of Our Lives" through a Vietnam era prism, has DeNiro run about naked like a Method Actor fishing for Oscars, and treats us to a forced sequence in which our heroes play Chopin on a piano whilst looking REALLY REALLY SERIOUS. This is a deep movie, see. The hell of Industrial America then becomes the hell of the Vietnam War. Here our heroes, now American soldiers, watch North Vietnamese savages kill civilians. They're then captured by the Vietnamese and made to play Russian Roulette. They survive this ordeal, but Walken's character is pushed into madness and begins to play Russian Roulette for money in a Saigon gambling hall. Symbolically unable to escape the damage done by Vietnam, he spends six years there, gambling with bullets. You'd think the law of averages would catch up with him, but no. "Don't leave me over there," Walken tells his buddy DeNiro, which leads to DeNiro having the longest delayed reaction in the history of cinema. Eight years later he goes back to Saigon in the hopes of finding Walken, a missing person's search which is apparently really easy. They find each other, Walken commits suicide (partially to punish - and prove his love to - "best man" DeNiro), the film ends with a funeral and a silly, unearned scene in which our gang sing "God Bless America". You can feel Cimino straining with every scene to make a GREAT EPIC. The film won five Oscars. Like most Vietnam war movies, "Hunter" hinges on romanticised madness. Deer hunting becomes a metaphor for "virtuous, humane kills" and Russian Roulette becomes a metaphor for the madness inducing chaos of Vietnam. As is typical of racist war films, the Vietnamese are portrayed as grinning (their dialogue is not even Vietnamese), Oriental savages (introduced with propagandistic scenes showing the NVA killing babies and women) and the "reason" for US defeat is sidestepped by making the Vietnam war itself incomprehensible. Where else but in an irrational country could the US lose a war? Whilst several sequences play with irony (Russian-Americans playing Russian roulette etc), Cimino's tale is one of solemn tragedy. An account of what evil, sadistic, barbaric Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans, the film, like "Apocalypse Now", oozes macho self pity with a dash of counter-culture disillusionment and strained appeals to high culture (Conrad, Eliot, Chopin songs, Orthodox hymns etc). The film is silly elsewhere, with random helicopter rescues, love triangles, many cheesy "dramatic" scenes and exploitative Roulette sequences (why's everyone in Saigaon playing Roulette?) which Cimino shoe-horned from another Las Vegas themed script he was working on. Some critics, like Jonathan Rosenbaum, spotted the film's hokiness right away. Pulitzer Prize winner Peter Arnett would call it a "simplistic lie". As with most war movies, the overriding message is "look what they did to us". Cimino perpetuates the racist stereotype that sustained much of America's involvement in Indochina, and hides behind designer madness and much irrationality. Compare to Pontecorvo's "Burn!", which offered a clear analysis of imperialist expansion, and "In the Year of the Pig" and "Hearts and Minds", two documentaries which the CIA waged war upon and whose theatres met with bomb threats. In 2012, the Pentagon began The Vietnam War Commemoration Project, a 13 year, 65 million dollar propaganda effort to clean up the image of the Vietnam war. What are they covering up? The fact that the North Vietnamese constituted a political movement with near total local, popular support, that the US artificially divided Vietnam in disregard of Geneva negotiations (becase Eisenhower knew over 80 percent of the population would vote for Ho Chi Minh), that the US put in place and backed psycho puppet leaders, that even the South didn't support the US, that the US did everything it could to prevent unification and scuttle elections, that 4 million Vietnamese died, that more bombs were dropped than in all previous wars combined, that tens of thousands were assassinated by the CIA's Phoenix Program, that nukes were threatened 13 times, that US land-mines still kill Vietnamese to this day (52000 and counting), that millions of gallons of poison, herbicide and chemicals were used, that US campaigns in Cambodia were directly responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot (himself supported with 89 million dollars) and the genocide which took place afterwards, that the first Tonkin Gulf incident was started by US aggression, that the second never happened, that over five million villagers were forcibly displaced, that political prisoners were jailed/tortured in "tiger cages" and that 90 percent of Northern levees, hospitals, villages, towns and industries were intentionally bombed. The US has similarly destabilised over 80 countries in the past 100 years. And yet here's a film with the NVA torturing small-town Americans. During and after the Iraq war, US soldiers committed suicide at a rate of 1 every 25 hours. This figure doesn't include attempted suicides (roughly 1900 in 2009 alone). In Vietnam, the number of US suicides totalled about 150,000. In real life, these vets were trapped in a double bind, unable to reconcile their belief that their conflict was righteous with their actual deeds; they thus nihilistically self-destructed. Cimino wants you to believe the opposite; that the NVA pushed men to suicide. 3/10  Depressing.

    Read the reviews by date and one can tell which generation knows war and which does not. The effects shown on the characters is what we see on returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Regardless war is still the same and has lasting effects on the participants just as this movie shows. The acting is good because they are all professionals in the true sense of the word. The script is good because all of it is true to some degree for veterans of the Vietnam debacle. the scenes are authentic-. Racist against Vietnamese-it is what it was. The film should be viewed today as a good history lesson for all. The only thing that has changed is that the steel mill has probably closed.

    The Vietnam War which lasted 15 years and ended in 1975, proved to be one of the costliest wars of our time considering its five million casualties, including the lives of over 60,000 US soldiers. Who won that war is no longer important, but the effect that war has to this day is beyond devastating. In what is easily the best and last significant film of his career, director Michael Cimino delivers a film with a prophetic vision just three years after the war ended, and is the first in a string of Vietnam war movies that is still attempted over three decades on.Having also co-written the screenplay, Cimino's story does not entirely focus on battle scenes or the war itself, but in essence, its aftermath on the lives of ordinary people. For this, his narrative spans three hours, of which the first hour is spent in impeccable character development formally introducing his Russian-American characters in a small Pennsylvanian steel-mill suburb. Mike, Nick, Steven, Stanley and John are five buddies in a typical frat-pack where after work hours are spent in male bonding activities of deer hunting and beer lounging. Their last gathering as a group is at Steven's Russian orthodox wedding reception pending Mike, Nick and Steven's enlistment in the Vietnam War. The wedding is a fun filled extravaganza where everyone has more than a good share of the festivities. Yet tell-tale signs of a devastating future are cleverly manifested through the reception, foretelling that things would never be the same again. Cut to war-torn Vietnam, Mike, Nick and Steven are POWs after a short battle sequence succumbing to North Vietnamese guerrilla tactics. Taking advantage over their captor's sadistic torture methods of Russian Roulette and rat infested imprisonment, the trio makes for a daring escape little knowing their physical and mental scars would haunt them for life. In a botched rescue attempt, their party is split and they never really regroup as before the war. Although welcomed back a hero, Mike finds it hard to adjust to his once perky lifestyle. Steven is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair living in total refusal of his family and friends. The crux of the plot surfaces when Mike goes all the way back to hellish Saigon in keeping his earlier promise where he would never leave Nick behind. What he finds is a ghastly excuse for a lifelong friend who has no recollection of their history. Worse, Nick is involved in a major gambling syndicate the likes of which still disturbs Mike: Russian roulette. Interestingly enough, Francis Ford Coppola brought out the critically acclaimed APOCALYPSE NOW just a year after this film, winning two Oscars in the process for his version of the horrifying atrocities during the war in Vietnam. Though Coppola focused mainly on the war, Cimino's film, metaphorically speaking, is an integration of three acts where graphic scenes in Vietnam form the repugnant sausage in an otherwise edible hotdog. And to think, this film was made thirty years before STOP-LOSS and HOME OF THE BRAVE, similar films about war veterans incapable of reverting to ordinary life. But Cimino had already set the tone of things to come, bagging five Academy Awards including "Best Picture" and "Best Director" out of five nominated categories. The Oscar for "Best Actor in a Supporting Role" also went to Christopher Walken for his outstanding role as Nick. Incidentally, this is Walken's first and only Oscar till date. Having secured an Oscar for his supporting role as the young Vito Corleone in Coppola's THE GODFATHER II and nominated for best supporting actor in the Martin Scorsese 1976 cult classic TAXI DRIVER, it isn't surprising that Robert De Niro was also nominated again for "Best Actor in a Leading Role" as Mike. Perhaps playing a mentally unstable Vietnam Veteran in TAXI DRIVER was all the training he required in adapting a similar themed role as the titled deer hunter. Also worth mentioning is a stunning Meryl Streep in her first ever Oscar nominated role as Linda, a passive women caught between Nick's proposal for marriage and Mike's shy charm. Also embedded in the support line up are John Savage as Steven, George Dzundza as the over eccentric John and John Cazale who passed away shortly after his role as Stanley. More than just a multi-award winning movie, this is one of De Niro's and Walken's building blocks to their currently much deserved status as Hollywood veterans. But wrapping up the perfect package goes to Cimino's credit in consideration of the lack of eye-popping special effects of Hollywood yester years. His reliance on stellar acting, perfectly timed suspense in a visionary plot and the birth of a sub-genre ahead of its time justifies why the American Film Institute has praised this film within the "100 Greatest American Movies of all time".

    In 1975, America was leaving Vietnam as the communist Southeast Asia country fell under communist control. Hollywood at the time had already made a Vietnam movie and that film was John Wayne's The Green Berets. That film became the first pro-war film about the Vietnam War. In other words, the war is good. Well, that didn't fit well with the critics. Critics in that time in 1968 wanted a serious movie about the Vietnam War. It wasn't till 1978, about 10 years later, that Hollywood made the first anti-war about the Vietnam War. That film, of course was The Deer Hunter. It told the story about three Pennsylvania steel-workers who are having the time of their lives. Among the ordinary jobs they have, they also have a wedding before they are send to Vietnam to fight. The three men are played, very through and very strong, by Robert De Niro, John Savage and Christopher Walken, who won a Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The three men leave the USA to go to Vietnam. They had no idea what kind of physical and mental destruction awaits them. The three men are forced to play Russian Roulette in a Vietcong hut. They have to survive the war and their aftermath. But, tragedy strikes and changes their lives, forever. As I said before, The Deer Hunter, has a lot of great performances by the three leading men and also, Meryl Streep, who is so effective as the role, Linda. The Deer Hunter took home 5 Oscars, including Best Picture. I felt that the movie works on character development. And, when we see the aftermath of the war, we see the aftermath of the three men. Director Michael Cimino tells this tale of war very thoroughly. Even though it runs 3 hours, it never runs out of steam. And even in the Russian Roulette scene, I felt so choked up that I felt like someone was strangling me. The suspense of that scene put me on edge. There's no doubt in my mind that The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978. After The Deer Hunter, other great Vietnam movies came along. Movies like Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July and Platoon followed. And even when The Deer Hunter was released in 1978, other films told different tales about the war. Go Tell the Spartans was another film that dealt with the topic of the Vietnam War. The Deer Hunter is a shattering, heroic and deeply effective war drama. **** 4 stars.

    Michael Cimino directs this long character study & war picture that follows a group of friends from a wedding, to a deer hunting trip, to finally the Vietnam war and its aftermath. Over three hour film details their lives before & after the war, on both the men and their families. Fine cast includes Robert De Nero, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep, who all deliver heartfelt and believable performances, but the trouble is that the extended POW sequence involving Russian Roulette just feels so bizarre and extreme, that I had a hard time buying it, especially when one of the characters becomes obsessed with it after their ordeal is over. Somehow, this drags the film down, and by the end, instead of feeling emotionally drained(like many of the audience claimed) the film felt emotionally muted, like it had gone too far afield and lost sight of what it was supposed to be about. Still, a minority view I suppose, since it did win an Academy Award for best picture and director.

    Watch this film. The film speaks to the lives we live and i think the director is making a point about free will, or the concept of it. There are choices we get to make in life, and there are situations that are thrust upon us that we have no control over. Going to Vietnam, Getting married, Being the type of hunter who is majestic and believes in a principle ( one shot ) or runs around like a sloppy drunk shooting nonsense into the air... these are the choices that we make in our life. Then there is the gun. You have no choice on if the bullet is in the chamber, or if it is not. The only choice you should have is if you play the game, that choice was taken from these young men which effected them all differently. 1) De Niro plays the idealistic character, the type who believes in things more important than hedonistic pleasure. This is why when he hunts, he uses the one bullet belief, and there is a moment between him and his prey. 2) Walken plays the agnostic type view, he neither hates nor loves the idealism of De Niro, but instead takes no stance on it at first and simply reflects on the beauty of the tree's and wondering if he is an asshole or not. 3) Steve: forget the actor's name, but he represents the boy who never really became a man, his thoughts are never deeply explored, but his actions reveal his thoughts, that he neither holds idealism or can rely strictly on self reflection and earthly delights. the effects of Gun on each: De Niro: De Niro's idealism goes out the window when presented with life or death questions, he is the closest to being a theist in his views and becomes an atheist in that murky rat filled water. We know this when he tells Walken they are going to abandon Steve. De Niro throws any sense of idealism out the window from then on out, and realizes that we cannot make and uphold our's or anyone else's "rules"... that we only have choices and reactions to our situations. De Niro's abandonment of his idealism is what saves him, and why he does not kill the deer at the end, he has learned that life it's self, or the joy of the hunt is the true purpose, and not the idealism of actually killing your prey with one shot. Walken: Walkens character at first can deal with the situation, but becomes stuck in that moment and cannot escape it. He has no idealism to loose, and now the beauty of the tree's has gone, and he has nothing left but self reflection. He cannot get past why the bullet was not in the chamber for him, and must repeat the situation until he feels he has taken control back over his life, of course he can only do this by ending his life. Steve: Steve being the eternal boy he is needs to be saved, cracks first, and is dependent on everyone else. In the end we realize our own traditions and idealism or lack there of lead us to certain points, some we can over come and some we cannot. De Niro comes out the best because he see's this and reacts to it, Walken and Steve are forever stuck in that moment. This is how the movie effected me personally.

    I want to say few words for this movie which is landmark for the end of Vietnam era. I know that it hurts for the American people to recall over and over again for this social experiment, so to call. I am not an American and if it was 40 years ago I would have never had a chance to write this review. As an Easterner we people from the Soviet bloc showed solidarity to the fight of the Vietnamese people and strangely enough I remember that some alimony and other salvation stuff was gathered from the civil population. I also know but can not support it with figures that the Warsaw Pact had sent some military force to Northern Vietnam; so it was not war America vs. Vietnam, but America vs. Vietnam plus Allies. Those are general truths and I am not withholding some state secret. Now let's talk about the movie. If it was only for the death of one of the principal actors in the film (John Cazale), that movie wouldn't have been worthy. Unfortunately, the movie received much spit from its critics and intentionally didn't received its full acclaim as first one shot at the war theater - before "Apocalypse Now" and before the Rambo series, etc. Bad luck was also that at Oscar 1979 it had to compete with another equally shattering film ("Midnight Express" - about life in Turkish prisons) which I think that is no less valuable than the Vietnamese saga, with remarkable supportive role from John Hurt. And also "Superman" (1978) was there and how is it possible not to receive a nickel. Thank you!

    It seems criminal, giving a multiple Oscar winner a negative review, yet alone an extremely loathing one. But the Academy has made some mistakes in the past in my eyes. Giving Sean Penn an Oscar nomination for I Am Sam or awarding Mel Gibson's Braveheart Best Picture. Michael Cimino's 'masterpiece' The Deer Hunter is one such example of a motion picture that gained massive praise on its original release but is, in my eyes, a dreadful hackneyed melodrama that tries to come across as meaningful and poignant when it is in reality, xenophobic, pretentious, boring and self-indulgent. It fails to be in anyway enduring nor does it make up for its three hour running length. It's honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen and even when I watched it again, I still couldn't fathom it. Three Russian-American friends, Mike, Nick and Steven, living in a small town in Pennyslvania, are about to go off to fight in Vietnam. Steven is getting married and Nick is in a loving relationship with Linda whom Mike is secretly in love with. Before heading off to fight in the war, the trio and their friends attend Steven's wedding and go off deer hunting. However, in Vietnam, they are trapped in terrible conditions as the Vietnamese endlessly torment them with games of Russian roulette. They manage to escape with Mike and Steven returning to their home with Nick staying in Saigon, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and now playing Russian roulette professionally. Steven ends up in a veteran's home whilst Mike tries to return to Saigon to save Nick as the city is about to fall to the Vietnamese. The Deer Hunter can be described as a blatant propaganda film. Cimino tries to tell the story from the perspective of the American soldiers who fight in the war and the effects of it. The Vietnamese side of the conflict is in no way explored though. They are portrayed as mindless child-killing gamblers with no remorse or mercy in their treatment of U.S soldiers. The playing Russian roulette element never occurred in the war and just appears to give the characters some traumatic experience to go through. The film comes across as a jingoistic feature that tries to appeal to the American audience. It's understandable why the film would've been critically acclaimed on its original release as America was still recovering from the war and seeing the Vietnamese as a group of sadistic monsters gave them some validity in their anger and despair. Nowadays, however, this comes across as manipulative nonsense trying to pass off as a compelling melodrama. The film feels too needlessly long at three hours and feels even longer than that. Many long films make up for their running lengths like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Seven Samurai and The Godfather Part II. But because Cimino uses an abundance of long unedited shots that should last for a few seconds, the film feels more like three days as opposed to three hours. The scene where they go hunting and annoy one of their friends by throwing his boots off the car is profoundly tedious and in no way engaging. The film also seems to want to talk about the effects of the war on American soldiers but if there is any underlying message throughout it, Cimino didn't convey it well. Maybe he felt that showing these men screaming and going hysterical would give the audience some dramatic heft to show the effects of the conflict. The film also consists of tediously repetitive dialogue with characters mumbling a bunch of crap at each other and getting drunk, singing and dancing like a bunch of idiots. The first act where the characters are all celebrating borders on boring and headache-inducing. The actors here don't do much to give their flatly written and one- dimensional characters any weight. Robert De Niro mumbles his way through the script, like a drunk. Christopher Walken just plays himself here though less entertaining than he normally is. John Savage's acting flip-flops between dull and random screaming. Meryl Streep doesn't do much with her character either to make her any identifiable. To the credit of these actors who have pretty much done great in other films, the faults mainly lie with the script and the direction and the fact that their characters barely have any personality. The Deer Hunter is one of those films that has no substance nor any dignity to accommodate the overly-long running length or even convey the effects of war properly, only by showing that it is damaging to American soldiers and it's all the Vietnamese' fault. It's a thoroughly hateful and tedious work and not something that I would like to revisit.

    This movie starts well but as soon as the protagonists get to Vietnam it just gets very - silly. The Soviets staged a walkout at the Berlin Film Festival when this was shown. I'm not surprised. The first Vietnamese depicted on the screen commits an atrocity on civilian women and children (that way we know who the baddies are). He pays for his crime, however, when the hero burns him alive - hooray! Then, all the heroes are captured by the enemy. Oh no! How could this happen? We are spared the humiliation of viewing this terrible event because next up is a hideous torture scene. Who knew that the Commies played Russian roulette with their (highly valuable) US prisoners? Never fear, the heroes kill their captors and escape! Luckily they can just float down the river to be picked up - then dropped back in the river? Oh well - back to Saigon where they are able to overcome the trauma of captivity - by playing some more Russian roulette? And so it goes until the movie ends with a rousing rendition of "God Bless America" - the US must have won the war after all! Oscars for everybody!! ** SPOILERS ** Some deer were injured in the making of this movie ** SPOILERS **

    The Deer Hunter is the type of movie that when you watch it you can't have anything else on your mind. Today's generation more often than not use their phones while they watch a movie, distracting them from the story at hand by text messages, social networking sites, and emails. When you watch The Deer Hunter, turn your phones off, put away the snacks, and empty your mind completely of any lingering predicaments they may have happened prior to sitting down to watch the film. The only way to experience The Deer Hunter is to live it. Director Michael Cimno is the showcased party from The Deer Hunter. The loose narrative allows Cimno to fully capture the characters, their struggles, and mental scarring. The script isn't cemented, which gives Cimno a lot of freedom. It's almost like we're watching a documentary of this group of people, the storytelling isn't very structured...but it works. I normally despise movies that don't get to the point they're trying to make, but The Deer Hunter struck me in a way no film of its nature has done before. It invested me into the lives of the characters, I really cared about what was going on, in a movie where not much does go on. The power Cimmo releases on the screen is admirable. The film's split into three segregated pieces: before war, during war, and after war. The Deer Hunter holds up the war to our faces and asks is this necessary? People who didn't go to war, get the point-blank experience of it through the film's gripping, raw, distressing transcendence of feelings. War changes people, we get to live that fully with The Deer Hunter. The first act, we get to know these characters as people. We identify with their day-to-day lives, living situations, and friendships. During the war, Cimno hits us with some painful scenes, including the iconic Russian Roulette sequence. It's an unforgettable, incredibly crafted scene in not just this film, but the war genre. It explores male sensitivity and the bonds that ignite in wartime. When the third act rolls around, it's about healing the scars from the war. You can see the scars every where you look. It's a catharsis of pain, loss, and mental disfigurement. Upon its release, controversy ensued due to the Russian Roulette topic covered heavily throughout the film. Apparently there was never any documented use of Russian Roulette and therefore the film was "lying" to the viewer. I dissent these accusations because The Deer Hunter isn't giving a play-by-play shot of the Vietnam war. It's main purpose is to depict the impact the war had on the men serving our country and their families. The Deer Hunter is an fictional, emotionally driven movie, not a news special describing the types of torture methods used in the war. The Deer Hunter would almost be like an acting exercise for its principle actors. Getting to live the big picture of a character, not just the crux of a story that we usually get in movies. The actors here are allowed to experiment with the characters at uninteresting moments and still create drama within those moments. When Robert De Niro puts himself in a role, he doesn't look back. De Niro's strength and susceptibility in the war scenes move your heart around in your chest. Meryl Streep gets to show off in her first meaty role, supplying each moment with a different level of emotion. Christopher Walken has the most complex character and performance; the transformation that his character lives is astounding. The actors bring this movie to life by falling back on the mission statement of the film: to show the effects of war on human beings. There's a specific technique Cimno uses with The Deer Hunter: lingering emotion. As the scene lingers on, emotion grows, and you become overwhelmed by the amount of response you feel in your heart to this film. The extreme length has been highly criticized by moviegoers, and usually I'm one of those people complaining about the unnecessary length in a movie, but here it feels right and is wonderfully fulfilling. Sure, a trim here or there wouldn't have hurt, but Cimno gets away with it because of the robust sentiment. It's a destructive piece that tears into your soul. Not having a distinctive narrative voice, the Cimno is the one who makes the movie the commanding experience that is The Deer Hunter. Some shots are so intense and violent that you shutter at the pain you're watching, but others are beautifully moving it creates a peace in our mind. Filled with numerous sublime performances, a tremendous view on war, and moving tales of the human condition, The Deer Hunter only has a few missteps along the way. You won't soon forget this film, as it will be tugging at your emotion strings long after you complete the movie. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    "The story we tell ourselves about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing, is a lie. The truth lies outside, in what we do." - Zizek A near scene-for-scene remake of 1939's "The Four Feathers", Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter" tells the story of several friends (Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken) from small town Pennsylvania. Early sequences watch as the gang work in a steel mill, congregate and go on hunting expeditions. Cimino's photography, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, is grand throughout, but the film quickly nosedives into pretentious, unintentionally funny territory. Cimino indulges in a prolonged wedding sequence (cribbed from Coppola who cribbed from Visconti), filters "Best Years of Our Lives" through a Vietnam era prism, has DeNiro run about naked like a Method Actor fishing for Oscars, and treats us to a forced sequence in which our heroes play Chopin on a piano whilst looking REALLY REALLY SERIOUS. This is a deep movie, see. The hell of Industrial America then becomes the hell of the Vietnam War. Here our heroes, now American soldiers, watch North Vietnamese savages kill civilians. They're then captured by the Vietnamese and made to play Russian Roulette. They survive this ordeal, but Walken's character is pushed into madness and begins to play Russian Roulette for money in a Saigon gambling hall. Symbolically unable to escape the damage done by Vietnam, he spends six years there, gambling with bullets. You'd think the law of averages would catch up with him, but no. "Don't leave me over there," Walken tells his buddy DeNiro, which leads to DeNiro having the longest delayed reaction in the history of cinema. Eight years later he goes back to Saigon in the hopes of finding Walken, a missing person's search which is apparently really easy. They find each other, Walken commits suicide (partially to punish - and prove his love to - "best man" DeNiro), the film ends with a funeral and a silly, unearned scene in which our gang sing "God Bless America". You can feel Cimino straining with every scene to make a GREAT EPIC. The film won five Oscars. Like most Vietnam war movies, "Hunter" hinges on romanticised madness. Deer hunting becomes a metaphor for "virtuous, humane kills" and Russian Roulette becomes a metaphor for the madness inducing chaos of Vietnam. As is typical of racist war films, the Vietnamese are portrayed as grinning (their dialogue is not even Vietnamese), Oriental savages (introduced with propagandistic scenes showing the NVA killing babies and women) and the "reason" for US defeat is sidestepped by making the Vietnam war itself incomprehensible. Where else but in an irrational country could the US lose a war? Whilst several sequences play with irony (Russian-Americans playing Russian roulette etc), Cimino's tale is one of solemn tragedy. An account of what evil, sadistic, barbaric Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans, the film, like "Apocalypse Now", oozes macho self pity with a dash of counter-culture disillusionment and strained appeals to high culture (Conrad, Eliot, Chopin songs, Orthodox hymns etc). The film is silly elsewhere, with random helicopter rescues, love triangles, many cheesy "dramatic" scenes and exploitative Roulette sequences (why's everyone in Saigaon playing Roulette?) which Cimino shoe-horned from another Las Vegas themed script he was working on. Some critics, like Jonathan Rosenbaum, spotted the film's hokiness right away. Pulitzer Prize winner Peter Arnett would call it a "simplistic lie". As with most war movies, the overriding message is "look what they did to us". Cimino perpetuates the racist stereotype that sustained much of America's involvement in Indochina, and hides behind designer madness and much irrationality. Compare to Pontecorvo's "Burn!", which offered a clear analysis of imperialist expansion, and "In the Year of the Pig" and "Hearts and Minds", two documentaries which the CIA waged war upon and whose theatres met with bomb threats. In 2012, the Pentagon began The Vietnam War Commemoration Project, a 13 year, 65 million dollar propaganda effort to clean up the image of the Vietnam war. What are they covering up? The fact that the North Vietnamese constituted a political movement with near total local, popular support, that the US artificially divided Vietnam in disregard of Geneva negotiations (becase Eisenhower knew over 80 percent of the population would vote for Ho Chi Minh), that the US put in place and backed psycho puppet leaders, that even the South didn't support the US, that the US did everything it could to prevent unification and scuttle elections, that 4 million Vietnamese died, that more bombs were dropped than in all previous wars combined, that tens of thousands were assassinated by the CIA's Phoenix Program, that nukes were threatened 13 times, that US land-mines still kill Vietnamese to this day (52000 and counting), that millions of gallons of poison, herbicide and chemicals were used, that US campaigns in Cambodia were directly responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot (himself supported with 89 million dollars) and the genocide which took place afterwards, that the first Tonkin Gulf incident was started by US aggression, that the second never happened, that over five million villagers were forcibly displaced, that political prisoners were jailed/tortured in "tiger cages" and that 90 percent of Northern levees, hospitals, villages, towns and industries were intentionally bombed. The US has similarly destabilised over 80 countries in the past 100 years. And yet here's a film with the NVA torturing small-town Americans. During and after the Iraq war, US soldiers committed suicide at a rate of 1 every 25 hours. This figure doesn't include attempted suicides (roughly 1900 in 2009 alone). In Vietnam, the number of US suicides totalled about 150,000. In real life, these vets were trapped in a double bind, unable to reconcile their belief that their conflict was righteous with their actual deeds; they thus nihilistically self-destructed. Cimino wants you to believe the opposite; that the NVA pushed men to suicide. 3/10  Depressing.

    Read the reviews by date and one can tell which generation knows war and which does not. The effects shown on the characters is what we see on returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Regardless war is still the same and has lasting effects on the participants just as this movie shows. The acting is good because they are all professionals in the true sense of the word. The script is good because all of it is true to some degree for veterans of the Vietnam debacle. the scenes are authentic-. Racist against Vietnamese-it is what it was. The film should be viewed today as a good history lesson for all. The only thing that has changed is that the steel mill has probably closed.

    The Vietnam War which lasted 15 years and ended in 1975, proved to be one of the costliest wars of our time considering its five million casualties, including the lives of over 60,000 US soldiers. Who won that war is no longer important, but the effect that war has to this day is beyond devastating. In what is easily the best and last significant film of his career, director Michael Cimino delivers a film with a prophetic vision just three years after the war ended, and is the first in a string of Vietnam war movies that is still attempted over three decades on.Having also co-written the screenplay, Cimino's story does not entirely focus on battle scenes or the war itself, but in essence, its aftermath on the lives of ordinary people. For this, his narrative spans three hours, of which the first hour is spent in impeccable character development formally introducing his Russian-American characters in a small Pennsylvanian steel-mill suburb. Mike, Nick, Steven, Stanley and John are five buddies in a typical frat-pack where after work hours are spent in male bonding activities of deer hunting and beer lounging. Their last gathering as a group is at Steven's Russian orthodox wedding reception pending Mike, Nick and Steven's enlistment in the Vietnam War. The wedding is a fun filled extravaganza where everyone has more than a good share of the festivities. Yet tell-tale signs of a devastating future are cleverly manifested through the reception, foretelling that things would never be the same again. Cut to war-torn Vietnam, Mike, Nick and Steven are POWs after a short battle sequence succumbing to North Vietnamese guerrilla tactics. Taking advantage over their captor's sadistic torture methods of Russian Roulette and rat infested imprisonment, the trio makes for a daring escape little knowing their physical and mental scars would haunt them for life. In a botched rescue attempt, their party is split and they never really regroup as before the war. Although welcomed back a hero, Mike finds it hard to adjust to his once perky lifestyle. Steven is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair living in total refusal of his family and friends. The crux of the plot surfaces when Mike goes all the way back to hellish Saigon in keeping his earlier promise where he would never leave Nick behind. What he finds is a ghastly excuse for a lifelong friend who has no recollection of their history. Worse, Nick is involved in a major gambling syndicate the likes of which still disturbs Mike: Russian roulette. Interestingly enough, Francis Ford Coppola brought out the critically acclaimed APOCALYPSE NOW just a year after this film, winning two Oscars in the process for his version of the horrifying atrocities during the war in Vietnam. Though Coppola focused mainly on the war, Cimino's film, metaphorically speaking, is an integration of three acts where graphic scenes in Vietnam form the repugnant sausage in an otherwise edible hotdog. And to think, this film was made thirty years before STOP-LOSS and HOME OF THE BRAVE, similar films about war veterans incapable of reverting to ordinary life. But Cimino had already set the tone of things to come, bagging five Academy Awards including "Best Picture" and "Best Director" out of five nominated categories. The Oscar for "Best Actor in a Supporting Role" also went to Christopher Walken for his outstanding role as Nick. Incidentally, this is Walken's first and only Oscar till date. Having secured an Oscar for his supporting role as the young Vito Corleone in Coppola's THE GODFATHER II and nominated for best supporting actor in the Martin Scorsese 1976 cult classic TAXI DRIVER, it isn't surprising that Robert De Niro was also nominated again for "Best Actor in a Leading Role" as Mike. Perhaps playing a mentally unstable Vietnam Veteran in TAXI DRIVER was all the training he required in adapting a similar themed role as the titled deer hunter. Also worth mentioning is a stunning Meryl Streep in her first ever Oscar nominated role as Linda, a passive women caught between Nick's proposal for marriage and Mike's shy charm. Also embedded in the support line up are John Savage as Steven, George Dzundza as the over eccentric John and John Cazale who passed away shortly after his role as Stanley. More than just a multi-award winning movie, this is one of De Niro's and Walken's building blocks to their currently much deserved status as Hollywood veterans. But wrapping up the perfect package goes to Cimino's credit in consideration of the lack of eye-popping special effects of Hollywood yester years. His reliance on stellar acting, perfectly timed suspense in a visionary plot and the birth of a sub-genre ahead of its time justifies why the American Film Institute has praised this film within the "100 Greatest American Movies of all time".

    In 1975, America was leaving Vietnam as the communist Southeast Asia country fell under communist control. Hollywood at the time had already made a Vietnam movie and that film was John Wayne's The Green Berets. That film became the first pro-war film about the Vietnam War. In other words, the war is good. Well, that didn't fit well with the critics. Critics in that time in 1968 wanted a serious movie about the Vietnam War. It wasn't till 1978, about 10 years later, that Hollywood made the first anti-war about the Vietnam War. That film, of course was The Deer Hunter. It told the story about three Pennsylvania steel-workers who are having the time of their lives. Among the ordinary jobs they have, they also have a wedding before they are send to Vietnam to fight. The three men are played, very through and very strong, by Robert De Niro, John Savage and Christopher Walken, who won a Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The three men leave the USA to go to Vietnam. They had no idea what kind of physical and mental destruction awaits them. The three men are forced to play Russian Roulette in a Vietcong hut. They have to survive the war and their aftermath. But, tragedy strikes and changes their lives, forever. As I said before, The Deer Hunter, has a lot of great performances by the three leading men and also, Meryl Streep, who is so effective as the role, Linda. The Deer Hunter took home 5 Oscars, including Best Picture. I felt that the movie works on character development. And, when we see the aftermath of the war, we see the aftermath of the three men. Director Michael Cimino tells this tale of war very thoroughly. Even though it runs 3 hours, it never runs out of steam. And even in the Russian Roulette scene, I felt so choked up that I felt like someone was strangling me. The suspense of that scene put me on edge. There's no doubt in my mind that The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978. After The Deer Hunter, other great Vietnam movies came along. Movies like Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July and Platoon followed. And even when The Deer Hunter was released in 1978, other films told different tales about the war. Go Tell the Spartans was another film that dealt with the topic of the Vietnam War. The Deer Hunter is a shattering, heroic and deeply effective war drama. **** 4 stars.

    Michael Cimino directs this long character study & war picture that follows a group of friends from a wedding, to a deer hunting trip, to finally the Vietnam war and its aftermath. Over three hour film details their lives before & after the war, on both the men and their families. Fine cast includes Robert De Nero, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep, who all deliver heartfelt and believable performances, but the trouble is that the extended POW sequence involving Russian Roulette just feels so bizarre and extreme, that I had a hard time buying it, especially when one of the characters becomes obsessed with it after their ordeal is over. Somehow, this drags the film down, and by the end, instead of feeling emotionally drained(like many of the audience claimed) the film felt emotionally muted, like it had gone too far afield and lost sight of what it was supposed to be about. Still, a minority view I suppose, since it did win an Academy Award for best picture and director.

    Watch this film. The film speaks to the lives we live and i think the director is making a point about free will, or the concept of it. There are choices we get to make in life, and there are situations that are thrust upon us that we have no control over. Going to Vietnam, Getting married, Being the type of hunter who is majestic and believes in a principle ( one shot ) or runs around like a sloppy drunk shooting nonsense into the air... these are the choices that we make in our life. Then there is the gun. You have no choice on if the bullet is in the chamber, or if it is not. The only choice you should have is if you play the game, that choice was taken from these young men which effected them all differently. 1) De Niro plays the idealistic character, the type who believes in things more important than hedonistic pleasure. This is why when he hunts, he uses the one bullet belief, and there is a moment between him and his prey. 2) Walken plays the agnostic type view, he neither hates nor loves the idealism of De Niro, but instead takes no stance on it at first and simply reflects on the beauty of the tree's and wondering if he is an asshole or not. 3) Steve: forget the actor's name, but he represents the boy who never really became a man, his thoughts are never deeply explored, but his actions reveal his thoughts, that he neither holds idealism or can rely strictly on self reflection and earthly delights. the effects of Gun on each: De Niro: De Niro's idealism goes out the window when presented with life or death questions, he is the closest to being a theist in his views and becomes an atheist in that murky rat filled water. We know this when he tells Walken they are going to abandon Steve. De Niro throws any sense of idealism out the window from then on out, and realizes that we cannot make and uphold our's or anyone else's "rules"... that we only have choices and reactions to our situations. De Niro's abandonment of his idealism is what saves him, and why he does not kill the deer at the end, he has learned that life it's self, or the joy of the hunt is the true purpose, and not the idealism of actually killing your prey with one shot. Walken: Walkens character at first can deal with the situation, but becomes stuck in that moment and cannot escape it. He has no idealism to loose, and now the beauty of the tree's has gone, and he has nothing left but self reflection. He cannot get past why the bullet was not in the chamber for him, and must repeat the situation until he feels he has taken control back over his life, of course he can only do this by ending his life. Steve: Steve being the eternal boy he is needs to be saved, cracks first, and is dependent on everyone else. In the end we realize our own traditions and idealism or lack there of lead us to certain points, some we can over come and some we cannot. De Niro comes out the best because he see's this and reacts to it, Walken and Steve are forever stuck in that moment. This is how the movie effected me personally.

    I want to say few words for this movie which is landmark for the end of Vietnam era. I know that it hurts for the American people to recall over and over again for this social experiment, so to call. I am not an American and if it was 40 years ago I would have never had a chance to write this review. As an Easterner we people from the Soviet bloc showed solidarity to the fight of the Vietnamese people and strangely enough I remember that some alimony and other salvation stuff was gathered from the civil population. I also know but can not support it with figures that the Warsaw Pact had sent some military force to Northern Vietnam; so it was not war America vs. Vietnam, but America vs. Vietnam plus Allies. Those are general truths and I am not withholding some state secret. Now let's talk about the movie. If it was only for the death of one of the principal actors in the film (John Cazale), that movie wouldn't have been worthy. Unfortunately, the movie received much spit from its critics and intentionally didn't received its full acclaim as first one shot at the war theater - before "Apocalypse Now" and before the Rambo series, etc. Bad luck was also that at Oscar 1979 it had to compete with another equally shattering film ("Midnight Express" - about life in Turkish prisons) which I think that is no less valuable than the Vietnamese saga, with remarkable supportive role from John Hurt. And also "Superman" (1978) was there and how is it possible not to receive a nickel. Thank you!

    It seems criminal, giving a multiple Oscar winner a negative review, yet alone an extremely loathing one. But the Academy has made some mistakes in the past in my eyes. Giving Sean Penn an Oscar nomination for I Am Sam or awarding Mel Gibson's Braveheart Best Picture. Michael Cimino's 'masterpiece' The Deer Hunter is one such example of a motion picture that gained massive praise on its original release but is, in my eyes, a dreadful hackneyed melodrama that tries to come across as meaningful and poignant when it is in reality, xenophobic, pretentious, boring and self-indulgent. It fails to be in anyway enduring nor does it make up for its three hour running length. It's honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen and even when I watched it again, I still couldn't fathom it. Three Russian-American friends, Mike, Nick and Steven, living in a small town in Pennyslvania, are about to go off to fight in Vietnam. Steven is getting married and Nick is in a loving relationship with Linda whom Mike is secretly in love with. Before heading off to fight in the war, the trio and their friends attend Steven's wedding and go off deer hunting. However, in Vietnam, they are trapped in terrible conditions as the Vietnamese endlessly torment them with games of Russian roulette. They manage to escape with Mike and Steven returning to their home with Nick staying in Saigon, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and now playing Russian roulette professionally. Steven ends up in a veteran's home whilst Mike tries to return to Saigon to save Nick as the city is about to fall to the Vietnamese. The Deer Hunter can be described as a blatant propaganda film. Cimino tries to tell the story from the perspective of the American soldiers who fight in the war and the effects of it. The Vietnamese side of the conflict is in no way explored though. They are portrayed as mindless child-killing gamblers with no remorse or mercy in their treatment of U.S soldiers. The playing Russian roulette element never occurred in the war and just appears to give the characters some traumatic experience to go through. The film comes across as a jingoistic feature that tries to appeal to the American audience. It's understandable why the film would've been critically acclaimed on its original release as America was still recovering from the war and seeing the Vietnamese as a group of sadistic monsters gave them some validity in their anger and despair. Nowadays, however, this comes across as manipulative nonsense trying to pass off as a compelling melodrama. The film feels too needlessly long at three hours and feels even longer than that. Many long films make up for their running lengths like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Seven Samurai and The Godfather Part II. But because Cimino uses an abundance of long unedited shots that should last for a few seconds, the film feels more like three days as opposed to three hours. The scene where they go hunting and annoy one of their friends by throwing his boots off the car is profoundly tedious and in no way engaging. The film also seems to want to talk about the effects of the war on American soldiers but if there is any underlying message throughout it, Cimino didn't convey it well. Maybe he felt that showing these men screaming and going hysterical would give the audience some dramatic heft to show the effects of the conflict. The film also consists of tediously repetitive dialogue with characters mumbling a bunch of crap at each other and getting drunk, singing and dancing like a bunch of idiots. The first act where the characters are all celebrating borders on boring and headache-inducing. The actors here don't do much to give their flatly written and one- dimensional characters any weight. Robert De Niro mumbles his way through the script, like a drunk. Christopher Walken just plays himself here though less entertaining than he normally is. John Savage's acting flip-flops between dull and random screaming. Meryl Streep doesn't do much with her character either to make her any identifiable. To the credit of these actors who have pretty much done great in other films, the faults mainly lie with the script and the direction and the fact that their characters barely have any personality. The Deer Hunter is one of those films that has no substance nor any dignity to accommodate the overly-long running length or even convey the effects of war properly, only by showing that it is damaging to American soldiers and it's all the Vietnamese' fault. It's a thoroughly hateful and tedious work and not something that I would like to revisit.

    This movie starts well but as soon as the protagonists get to Vietnam it just gets very - silly. The Soviets staged a walkout at the Berlin Film Festival when this was shown. I'm not surprised. The first Vietnamese depicted on the screen commits an atrocity on civilian women and children (that way we know who the baddies are). He pays for his crime, however, when the hero burns him alive - hooray! Then, all the heroes are captured by the enemy. Oh no! How could this happen? We are spared the humiliation of viewing this terrible event because next up is a hideous torture scene. Who knew that the Commies played Russian roulette with their (highly valuable) US prisoners? Never fear, the heroes kill their captors and escape! Luckily they can just float down the river to be picked up - then dropped back in the river? Oh well - back to Saigon where they are able to overcome the trauma of captivity - by playing some more Russian roulette? And so it goes until the movie ends with a rousing rendition of "God Bless America" - the US must have won the war after all! Oscars for everybody!! ** SPOILERS ** Some deer were injured in the making of this movie ** SPOILERS **

    The Deer Hunter is the type of movie that when you watch it you can't have anything else on your mind. Today's generation more often than not use their phones while they watch a movie, distracting them from the story at hand by text messages, social networking sites, and emails. When you watch The Deer Hunter, turn your phones off, put away the snacks, and empty your mind completely of any lingering predicaments they may have happened prior to sitting down to watch the film. The only way to experience The Deer Hunter is to live it. Director Michael Cimno is the showcased party from The Deer Hunter. The loose narrative allows Cimno to fully capture the characters, their struggles, and mental scarring. The script isn't cemented, which gives Cimno a lot of freedom. It's almost like we're watching a documentary of this group of people, the storytelling isn't very structured...but it works. I normally despise movies that don't get to the point they're trying to make, but The Deer Hunter struck me in a way no film of its nature has done before. It invested me into the lives of the characters, I really cared about what was going on, in a movie where not much does go on. The power Cimmo releases on the screen is admirable. The film's split into three segregated pieces: before war, during war, and after war. The Deer Hunter holds up the war to our faces and asks is this necessary? People who didn't go to war, get the point-blank experience of it through the film's gripping, raw, distressing transcendence of feelings. War changes people, we get to live that fully with The Deer Hunter. The first act, we get to know these characters as people. We identify with their day-to-day lives, living situations, and friendships. During the war, Cimno hits us with some painful scenes, including the iconic Russian Roulette sequence. It's an unforgettable, incredibly crafted scene in not just this film, but the war genre. It explores male sensitivity and the bonds that ignite in wartime. When the third act rolls around, it's about healing the scars from the war. You can see the scars every where you look. It's a catharsis of pain, loss, and mental disfigurement. Upon its release, controversy ensued due to the Russian Roulette topic covered heavily throughout the film. Apparently there was never any documented use of Russian Roulette and therefore the film was "lying" to the viewer. I dissent these accusations because The Deer Hunter isn't giving a play-by-play shot of the Vietnam war. It's main purpose is to depict the impact the war had on the men serving our country and their families. The Deer Hunter is an fictional, emotionally driven movie, not a news special describing the types of torture methods used in the war. The Deer Hunter would almost be like an acting exercise for its principle actors. Getting to live the big picture of a character, not just the crux of a story that we usually get in movies. The actors here are allowed to experiment with the characters at uninteresting moments and still create drama within those moments. When Robert De Niro puts himself in a role, he doesn't look back. De Niro's strength and susceptibility in the war scenes move your heart around in your chest. Meryl Streep gets to show off in her first meaty role, supplying each moment with a different level of emotion. Christopher Walken has the most complex character and performance; the transformation that his character lives is astounding. The actors bring this movie to life by falling back on the mission statement of the film: to show the effects of war on human beings. There's a specific technique Cimno uses with The Deer Hunter: lingering emotion. As the scene lingers on, emotion grows, and you become overwhelmed by the amount of response you feel in your heart to this film. The extreme length has been highly criticized by moviegoers, and usually I'm one of those people complaining about the unnecessary length in a movie, but here it feels right and is wonderfully fulfilling. Sure, a trim here or there wouldn't have hurt, but Cimno gets away with it because of the robust sentiment. It's a destructive piece that tears into your soul. Not having a distinctive narrative voice, the Cimno is the one who makes the movie the commanding experience that is The Deer Hunter. Some shots are so intense and violent that you shutter at the pain you're watching, but others are beautifully moving it creates a peace in our mind. Filled with numerous sublime performances, a tremendous view on war, and moving tales of the human condition, The Deer Hunter only has a few missteps along the way. You won't soon forget this film, as it will be tugging at your emotion strings long after you complete the movie. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    "The story we tell ourselves about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing, is a lie. The truth lies outside, in what we do." - Zizek A near scene-for-scene remake of 1939's "The Four Feathers", Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter" tells the story of several friends (Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken) from small town Pennsylvania. Early sequences watch as the gang work in a steel mill, congregate and go on hunting expeditions. Cimino's photography, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, is grand throughout, but the film quickly nosedives into pretentious, unintentionally funny territory. Cimino indulges in a prolonged wedding sequence (cribbed from Coppola who cribbed from Visconti), filters "Best Years of Our Lives" through a Vietnam era prism, has DeNiro run about naked like a Method Actor fishing for Oscars, and treats us to a forced sequence in which our heroes play Chopin on a piano whilst looking REALLY REALLY SERIOUS. This is a deep movie, see. The hell of Industrial America then becomes the hell of the Vietnam War. Here our heroes, now American soldiers, watch North Vietnamese savages kill civilians. They're then captured by the Vietnamese and made to play Russian Roulette. They survive this ordeal, but Walken's character is pushed into madness and begins to play Russian Roulette for money in a Saigon gambling hall. Symbolically unable to escape the damage done by Vietnam, he spends six years there, gambling with bullets. You'd think the law of averages would catch up with him, but no. "Don't leave me over there," Walken tells his buddy DeNiro, which leads to DeNiro having the longest delayed reaction in the history of cinema. Eight years later he goes back to Saigon in the hopes of finding Walken, a missing person's search which is apparently really easy. They find each other, Walken commits suicide (partially to punish - and prove his love to - "best man" DeNiro), the film ends with a funeral and a silly, unearned scene in which our gang sing "God Bless America". You can feel Cimino straining with every scene to make a GREAT EPIC. The film won five Oscars. Like most Vietnam war movies, "Hunter" hinges on romanticised madness. Deer hunting becomes a metaphor for "virtuous, humane kills" and Russian Roulette becomes a metaphor for the madness inducing chaos of Vietnam. As is typical of racist war films, the Vietnamese are portrayed as grinning (their dialogue is not even Vietnamese), Oriental savages (introduced with propagandistic scenes showing the NVA killing babies and women) and the "reason" for US defeat is sidestepped by making the Vietnam war itself incomprehensible. Where else but in an irrational country could the US lose a war? Whilst several sequences play with irony (Russian-Americans playing Russian roulette etc), Cimino's tale is one of solemn tragedy. An account of what evil, sadistic, barbaric Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans, the film, like "Apocalypse Now", oozes macho self pity with a dash of counter-culture disillusionment and strained appeals to high culture (Conrad, Eliot, Chopin songs, Orthodox hymns etc). The film is silly elsewhere, with random helicopter rescues, love triangles, many cheesy "dramatic" scenes and exploitative Roulette sequences (why's everyone in Saigaon playing Roulette?) which Cimino shoe-horned from another Las Vegas themed script he was working on. Some critics, like Jonathan Rosenbaum, spotted the film's hokiness right away. Pulitzer Prize winner Peter Arnett would call it a "simplistic lie". As with most war movies, the overriding message is "look what they did to us". Cimino perpetuates the racist stereotype that sustained much of America's involvement in Indochina, and hides behind designer madness and much irrationality. Compare to Pontecorvo's "Burn!", which offered a clear analysis of imperialist expansion, and "In the Year of the Pig" and "Hearts and Minds", two documentaries which the CIA waged war upon and whose theatres met with bomb threats. In 2012, the Pentagon began The Vietnam War Commemoration Project, a 13 year, 65 million dollar propaganda effort to clean up the image of the Vietnam war. What are they covering up? The fact that the North Vietnamese constituted a political movement with near total local, popular support, that the US artificially divided Vietnam in disregard of Geneva negotiations (becase Eisenhower knew over 80 percent of the population would vote for Ho Chi Minh), that the US put in place and backed psycho puppet leaders, that even the South didn't support the US, that the US did everything it could to prevent unification and scuttle elections, that 4 million Vietnamese died, that more bombs were dropped than in all previous wars combined, that tens of thousands were assassinated by the CIA's Phoenix Program, that nukes were threatened 13 times, that US land-mines still kill Vietnamese to this day (52000 and counting), that millions of gallons of poison, herbicide and chemicals were used, that US campaigns in Cambodia were directly responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot (himself supported with 89 million dollars) and the genocide which took place afterwards, that the first Tonkin Gulf incident was started by US aggression, that the second never happened, that over five million villagers were forcibly displaced, that political prisoners were jailed/tortured in "tiger cages" and that 90 percent of Northern levees, hospitals, villages, towns and industries were intentionally bombed. The US has similarly destabilised over 80 countries in the past 100 years. And yet here's a film with the NVA torturing small-town Americans. During and after the Iraq war, US soldiers committed suicide at a rate of 1 every 25 hours. This figure doesn't include attempted suicides (roughly 1900 in 2009 alone). In Vietnam, the number of US suicides totalled about 150,000. In real life, these vets were trapped in a double bind, unable to reconcile their belief that their conflict was righteous with their actual deeds; they thus nihilistically self-destructed. Cimino wants you to believe the opposite; that the NVA pushed men to suicide. 3/10  Depressing.

    Read the reviews by date and one can tell which generation knows war and which does not. The effects shown on the characters is what we see on returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Regardless war is still the same and has lasting effects on the participants just as this movie shows. The acting is good because they are all professionals in the true sense of the word. The script is good because all of it is true to some degree for veterans of the Vietnam debacle. the scenes are authentic-. Racist against Vietnamese-it is what it was. The film should be viewed today as a good history lesson for all. The only thing that has changed is that the steel mill has probably closed.

    The Vietnam War which lasted 15 years and ended in 1975, proved to be one of the costliest wars of our time considering its five million casualties, including the lives of over 60,000 US soldiers. Who won that war is no longer important, but the effect that war has to this day is beyond devastating. In what is easily the best and last significant film of his career, director Michael Cimino delivers a film with a prophetic vision just three years after the war ended, and is the first in a string of Vietnam war movies that is still attempted over three decades on.Having also co-written the screenplay, Cimino's story does not entirely focus on battle scenes or the war itself, but in essence, its aftermath on the lives of ordinary people. For this, his narrative spans three hours, of which the first hour is spent in impeccable character development formally introducing his Russian-American characters in a small Pennsylvanian steel-mill suburb. Mike, Nick, Steven, Stanley and John are five buddies in a typical frat-pack where after work hours are spent in male bonding activities of deer hunting and beer lounging. Their last gathering as a group is at Steven's Russian orthodox wedding reception pending Mike, Nick and Steven's enlistment in the Vietnam War. The wedding is a fun filled extravaganza where everyone has more than a good share of the festivities. Yet tell-tale signs of a devastating future are cleverly manifested through the reception, foretelling that things would never be the same again. Cut to war-torn Vietnam, Mike, Nick and Steven are POWs after a short battle sequence succumbing to North Vietnamese guerrilla tactics. Taking advantage over their captor's sadistic torture methods of Russian Roulette and rat infested imprisonment, the trio makes for a daring escape little knowing their physical and mental scars would haunt them for life. In a botched rescue attempt, their party is split and they never really regroup as before the war. Although welcomed back a hero, Mike finds it hard to adjust to his once perky lifestyle. Steven is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair living in total refusal of his family and friends. The crux of the plot surfaces when Mike goes all the way back to hellish Saigon in keeping his earlier promise where he would never leave Nick behind. What he finds is a ghastly excuse for a lifelong friend who has no recollection of their history. Worse, Nick is involved in a major gambling syndicate the likes of which still disturbs Mike: Russian roulette. Interestingly enough, Francis Ford Coppola brought out the critically acclaimed APOCALYPSE NOW just a year after this film, winning two Oscars in the process for his version of the horrifying atrocities during the war in Vietnam. Though Coppola focused mainly on the war, Cimino's film, metaphorically speaking, is an integration of three acts where graphic scenes in Vietnam form the repugnant sausage in an otherwise edible hotdog. And to think, this film was made thirty years before STOP-LOSS and HOME OF THE BRAVE, similar films about war veterans incapable of reverting to ordinary life. But Cimino had already set the tone of things to come, bagging five Academy Awards including "Best Picture" and "Best Director" out of five nominated categories. The Oscar for "Best Actor in a Supporting Role" also went to Christopher Walken for his outstanding role as Nick. Incidentally, this is Walken's first and only Oscar till date. Having secured an Oscar for his supporting role as the young Vito Corleone in Coppola's THE GODFATHER II and nominated for best supporting actor in the Martin Scorsese 1976 cult classic TAXI DRIVER, it isn't surprising that Robert De Niro was also nominated again for "Best Actor in a Leading Role" as Mike. Perhaps playing a mentally unstable Vietnam Veteran in TAXI DRIVER was all the training he required in adapting a similar themed role as the titled deer hunter. Also worth mentioning is a stunning Meryl Streep in her first ever Oscar nominated role as Linda, a passive women caught between Nick's proposal for marriage and Mike's shy charm. Also embedded in the support line up are John Savage as Steven, George Dzundza as the over eccentric John and John Cazale who passed away shortly after his role as Stanley. More than just a multi-award winning movie, this is one of De Niro's and Walken's building blocks to their currently much deserved status as Hollywood veterans. But wrapping up the perfect package goes to Cimino's credit in consideration of the lack of eye-popping special effects of Hollywood yester years. His reliance on stellar acting, perfectly timed suspense in a visionary plot and the birth of a sub-genre ahead of its time justifies why the American Film Institute has praised this film within the "100 Greatest American Movies of all time".

    In 1975, America was leaving Vietnam as the communist Southeast Asia country fell under communist control. Hollywood at the time had already made a Vietnam movie and that film was John Wayne's The Green Berets. That film became the first pro-war film about the Vietnam War. In other words, the war is good. Well, that didn't fit well with the critics. Critics in that time in 1968 wanted a serious movie about the Vietnam War. It wasn't till 1978, about 10 years later, that Hollywood made the first anti-war about the Vietnam War. That film, of course was The Deer Hunter. It told the story about three Pennsylvania steel-workers who are having the time of their lives. Among the ordinary jobs they have, they also have a wedding before they are send to Vietnam to fight. The three men are played, very through and very strong, by Robert De Niro, John Savage and Christopher Walken, who won a Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The three men leave the USA to go to Vietnam. They had no idea what kind of physical and mental destruction awaits them. The three men are forced to play Russian Roulette in a Vietcong hut. They have to survive the war and their aftermath. But, tragedy strikes and changes their lives, forever. As I said before, The Deer Hunter, has a lot of great performances by the three leading men and also, Meryl Streep, who is so effective as the role, Linda. The Deer Hunter took home 5 Oscars, including Best Picture. I felt that the movie works on character development. And, when we see the aftermath of the war, we see the aftermath of the three men. Director Michael Cimino tells this tale of war very thoroughly. Even though it runs 3 hours, it never runs out of steam. And even in the Russian Roulette scene, I felt so choked up that I felt like someone was strangling me. The suspense of that scene put me on edge. There's no doubt in my mind that The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978. After The Deer Hunter, other great Vietnam movies came along. Movies like Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July and Platoon followed. And even when The Deer Hunter was released in 1978, other films told different tales about the war. Go Tell the Spartans was another film that dealt with the topic of the Vietnam War. The Deer Hunter is a shattering, heroic and deeply effective war drama. **** 4 stars.

    Michael Cimino directs this long character study & war picture that follows a group of friends from a wedding, to a deer hunting trip, to finally the Vietnam war and its aftermath. Over three hour film details their lives before & after the war, on both the men and their families. Fine cast includes Robert De Nero, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep, who all deliver heartfelt and believable performances, but the trouble is that the extended POW sequence involving Russian Roulette just feels so bizarre and extreme, that I had a hard time buying it, especially when one of the characters becomes obsessed with it after their ordeal is over. Somehow, this drags the film down, and by the end, instead of feeling emotionally drained(like many of the audience claimed) the film felt emotionally muted, like it had gone too far afield and lost sight of what it was supposed to be about. Still, a minority view I suppose, since it did win an Academy Award for best picture and director.

    Watch this film. The film speaks to the lives we live and i think the director is making a point about free will, or the concept of it. There are choices we get to make in life, and there are situations that are thrust upon us that we have no control over. Going to Vietnam, Getting married, Being the type of hunter who is majestic and believes in a principle ( one shot ) or runs around like a sloppy drunk shooting nonsense into the air... these are the choices that we make in our life. Then there is the gun. You have no choice on if the bullet is in the chamber, or if it is not. The only choice you should have is if you play the game, that choice was taken from these young men which effected them all differently. 1) De Niro plays the idealistic character, the type who believes in things more important than hedonistic pleasure. This is why when he hunts, he uses the one bullet belief, and there is a moment between him and his prey. 2) Walken plays the agnostic type view, he neither hates nor loves the idealism of De Niro, but instead takes no stance on it at first and simply reflects on the beauty of the tree's and wondering if he is an asshole or not. 3) Steve: forget the actor's name, but he represents the boy who never really became a man, his thoughts are never deeply explored, but his actions reveal his thoughts, that he neither holds idealism or can rely strictly on self reflection and earthly delights. the effects of Gun on each: De Niro: De Niro's idealism goes out the window when presented with life or death questions, he is the closest to being a theist in his views and becomes an atheist in that murky rat filled water. We know this when he tells Walken they are going to abandon Steve. De Niro throws any sense of idealism out the window from then on out, and realizes that we cannot make and uphold our's or anyone else's "rules"... that we only have choices and reactions to our situations. De Niro's abandonment of his idealism is what saves him, and why he does not kill the deer at the end, he has learned that life it's self, or the joy of the hunt is the true purpose, and not the idealism of actually killing your prey with one shot. Walken: Walkens character at first can deal with the situation, but becomes stuck in that moment and cannot escape it. He has no idealism to loose, and now the beauty of the tree's has gone, and he has nothing left but self reflection. He cannot get past why the bullet was not in the chamber for him, and must repeat the situation until he feels he has taken control back over his life, of course he can only do this by ending his life. Steve: Steve being the eternal boy he is needs to be saved, cracks first, and is dependent on everyone else. In the end we realize our own traditions and idealism or lack there of lead us to certain points, some we can over come and some we cannot. De Niro comes out the best because he see's this and reacts to it, Walken and Steve are forever stuck in that moment. This is how the movie effected me personally.

    I want to say few words for this movie which is landmark for the end of Vietnam era.

And also "Superman" (1978) was there and how is it possible not to receive a nickel. Thank you!

    It seems criminal, giving a multiple Oscar winner a negative review, yet alone an extremely loathing one. But the Academy has made some mistakes in the past in my eyes. Giving Sean Penn an Oscar nomination for I Am Sam or awarding Mel Gibson's Braveheart Best Picture. Michael Cimino's 'masterpiece' The Deer Hunter is one such example of a motion picture that gained massive praise on its original release but is, in my eyes, a dreadful hackneyed melodrama that tries to come across as meaningful and poignant when it is in reality, xenophobic, pretentious, boring and self-indulgent. It fails to be in anyway enduring nor does it make up for its three hour running length. It's honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen and even when I watched it again, I still couldn't fathom it. Three Russian-American friends, Mike, Nick and Steven, living in a small town in Pennyslvania, are about to go off to fight in Vietnam. Steven is getting married and Nick is in a loving relationship with Linda whom Mike is secretly in love with. Before heading off to fight in the war, the trio and their friends attend Steven's wedding and go off deer hunting. However, in Vietnam, they are trapped in terrible conditions as the Vietnamese endlessly torment them with games of Russian roulette. They manage to escape with Mike and Steven returning to their home with Nick staying in Saigon, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and now playing Russian roulette professionally. Steven ends up in a veteran's home whilst Mike tries to return to Saigon to save Nick as the city is about to fall to the Vietnamese. The Deer Hunter can be described as a blatant propaganda film. Cimino tries to tell the story from the perspective of the American soldiers who fight in the war and the effects of it. The Vietnamese side of the conflict is in no way explored though. They are portrayed as mindless child-killing gamblers with no remorse or mercy in their treatment of U.S soldiers. The playing Russian roulette element never occurred in the war and just appears to give the characters some traumatic experience to go through. The film comes across as a jingoistic feature that tries to appeal to the American audience. It's understandable why the film would've been critically acclaimed on its original release as America was still recovering from the war and seeing the Vietnamese as a group of sadistic monsters gave them some validity in their anger and despair. Nowadays, however, this comes across as manipulative nonsense trying to pass off as a compelling melodrama. The film feels too needlessly long at three hours and feels even longer than that. Many long films make up for their running lengths like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Seven Samurai and The Godfather Part II. But because Cimino uses an abundance of long unedited shots that should last for a few seconds, the film feels more like three days as opposed to three hours. The scene where they go hunting and annoy one of their friends by throwing his boots off the car is profoundly tedious and in no way engaging. The film also seems to want to talk about the effects of the war on American soldiers but if there is any underlying message throughout it, Cimino didn't convey it well. Maybe he felt that showing these men screaming and going hysterical would give the audience some dramatic heft to show the effects of the conflict. The film also consists of tediously repetitive dialogue with characters mumbling a bunch of crap at each other and getting drunk, singing and dancing like a bunch of idiots. The first act where the characters are all celebrating borders on boring and headache-inducing. The actors here don't do much to give their flatly written and one- dimensional characters any weight. Robert De Niro mumbles his way through the script, like a drunk. Christopher Walken just plays himself here though less entertaining than he normally is. John Savage's acting flip-flops between dull and random screaming. Meryl Streep doesn't do much with her character either to make her any identifiable. To the credit of these actors who have pretty much done great in other films, the faults mainly lie with the script and the direction and the fact that their characters barely have any personality. The Deer Hunter is one of those films that has no substance nor any dignity to accommodate the overly-long running length or even convey the effects of war properly, only by showing that it is damaging to American soldiers and it's all the Vietnamese' fault. It's a thoroughly hateful and tedious work and not something that I would like to revisit.

    This movie starts well but as soon as the protagonists get to Vietnam it just gets very - silly. The Soviets staged a walkout at the Berlin Film Festival when this was shown. I'm not surprised. The first Vietnamese depicted on the screen commits an atrocity on civilian women and children (that way we know who the baddies are). He pays for his crime, however, when the hero burns him alive - hooray! Then, all the heroes are captured by the enemy. Oh no! How could this happen? We are spared the humiliation of viewing this terrible event because next up is a hideous torture scene. Who knew that the Commies played Russian roulette with their (highly valuable) US prisoners? Never fear, the heroes kill their captors and escape! Luckily they can just float down the river to be picked up - then dropped back in the river? Oh well - back to Saigon where they are able to overcome the trauma of captivity - by playing some more Russian roulette? And so it goes until the movie ends with a rousing rendition of "God Bless America" - the US must have won the war after all! Oscars for everybody!! ** SPOILERS ** Some deer were injured in the making of this movie ** SPOILERS **

    The Deer Hunter is the type of movie that when you watch it you can't have anything else on your mind. Today's generation more often than not use their phones while they watch a movie, distracting them from the story at hand by text messages, social networking sites, and emails. When you watch The Deer Hunter, turn your phones off, put away the snacks, and empty your mind completely of any lingering predicaments they may have happened prior to sitting down to watch the film. The only way to experience The Deer Hunter is to live it. Director Michael Cimno is the showcased party from The Deer Hunter. The loose narrative allows Cimno to fully capture the characters, their struggles, and mental scarring. The script isn't cemented, which gives Cimno a lot of freedom. It's almost like we're watching a documentary of this group of people, the storytelling isn't very structured...but it works. I normally despise movies that don't get to the point they're trying to make, but The Deer Hunter struck me in a way no film of its nature has done before. It invested me into the lives of the characters, I really cared about what was going on, in a movie where not much does go on. The power Cimmo releases on the screen is admirable. The film's split into three segregated pieces: before war, during war, and after war. The Deer Hunter holds up the war to our faces and asks is this necessary? People who didn't go to war, get the point-blank experience of it through the film's gripping, raw, distressing transcendence of feelings. War changes people, we get to live that fully with The Deer Hunter. The first act, we get to know these characters as people. We identify with their day-to-day lives, living situations, and friendships. During the war, Cimno hits us with some painful scenes, including the iconic Russian Roulette sequence. It's an unforgettable, incredibly crafted scene in not just this film, but the war genre. It explores male sensitivity and the bonds that ignite in wartime. When the third act rolls around, it's about healing the scars from the war. You can see the scars every where you look. It's a catharsis of pain, loss, and mental disfigurement. Upon its release, controversy ensued due to the Russian Roulette topic covered heavily throughout the film. Apparently there was never any documented use of Russian Roulette and therefore the film was "lying" to the viewer. I dissent these accusations because The Deer Hunter isn't giving a play-by-play shot of the Vietnam war. It's main purpose is to depict the impact the war had on the men serving our country and their families. The Deer Hunter is an fictional, emotionally driven movie, not a news special describing the types of torture methods used in the war. The Deer Hunter would almost be like an acting exercise for its principle actors. Getting to live the big picture of a character, not just the crux of a story that we usually get in movies. The actors here are allowed to experiment with the characters at uninteresting moments and still create drama within those moments. When Robert De Niro puts himself in a role, he doesn't look back. De Niro's strength and susceptibility in the war scenes move your heart around in your chest. Meryl Streep gets to show off in her first meaty role, supplying each moment with a different level of emotion. Christopher Walken has the most complex character and performance; the transformation that his character lives is astounding. The actors bring this movie to life by falling back on the mission statement of the film: to show the effects of war on human beings. There's a specific technique Cimno uses with The Deer Hunter: lingering emotion. As the scene lingers on, emotion grows, and you become overwhelmed by the amount of response you feel in your heart to this film. The extreme length has been highly criticized by moviegoers, and usually I'm one of those people complaining about the unnecessary length in a movie, but here it feels right and is wonderfully fulfilling. Sure, a trim here or there wouldn't have hurt, but Cimno gets away with it because of the robust sentiment. It's a destructive piece that tears into your soul. Not having a distinctive narrative voice, the Cimno is the one who makes the movie the commanding experience that is The Deer Hunter. Some shots are so intense and violent that you shutter at the pain you're watching, but others are beautifully moving it creates a peace in our mind. Filled with numerous sublime performances, a tremendous view on war, and moving tales of the human condition, The Deer Hunter only has a few missteps along the way. You won't soon forget this film, as it will be tugging at your emotion strings long after you complete the movie. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    "The story we tell ourselves about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing, is a lie. The truth lies outside, in what we do." - Zizek A near scene-for-scene remake of 1939's "The Four Feathers", Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter" tells the story of several friends (Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken) from small town Pennsylvania. Early sequences watch as the gang work in a steel mill, congregate and go on hunting expeditions. Cimino's photography, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, is grand throughout, but the film quickly nosedives into pretentious, unintentionally funny territory. Cimino indulges in a prolonged wedding sequence (cribbed from Coppola who cribbed from Visconti), filters "Best Years of Our Lives" through a Vietnam era prism, has DeNiro run about naked like a Method Actor fishing for Oscars, and treats us to a forced sequence in which our heroes play Chopin on a piano whilst looking REALLY REALLY SERIOUS. This is a deep movie, see. The hell of Industrial America then becomes the hell of the Vietnam War. Here our heroes, now American soldiers, watch North Vietnamese savages kill civilians. They're then captured by the Vietnamese and made to play Russian Roulette. They survive this ordeal, but Walken's character is pushed into madness and begins to play Russian Roulette for money in a Saigon gambling hall. Symbolically unable to escape the damage done by Vietnam, he spends six years there, gambling with bullets. You'd think the law of averages would catch up with him, but no. "Don't leave me over there," Walken tells his buddy DeNiro, which leads to DeNiro having the longest delayed reaction in the history of cinema. Eight years later he goes back to Saigon in the hopes of finding Walken, a missing person's search which is apparently really easy. They find each other, Walken commits suicide (partially to punish - and prove his love to - "best man" DeNiro), the film ends with a funeral and a silly, unearned scene in which our gang sing "God Bless America". You can feel Cimino straining with every scene to make a GREAT EPIC. The film won five Oscars. Like most Vietnam war movies, "Hunter" hinges on romanticised madness. Deer hunting becomes a metaphor for "virtuous, humane kills" and Russian Roulette becomes a metaphor for the madness inducing chaos of Vietnam. As is typical of racist war films, the Vietnamese are portrayed as grinning (their dialogue is not even Vietnamese), Oriental savages (introduced with propagandistic scenes showing the NVA killing babies and women) and the "reason" for US defeat is sidestepped by making the Vietnam war itself incomprehensible. Where else but in an irrational country could the US lose a war? Whilst several sequences play with irony (Russian-Americans playing Russian roulette etc), Cimino's tale is one of solemn tragedy. An account of what evil, sadistic, barbaric Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans, the film, like "Apocalypse Now", oozes macho self pity with a dash of counter-culture disillusionment and strained appeals to high culture (Conrad, Eliot, Chopin songs, Orthodox hymns etc). The film is silly elsewhere, with random helicopter rescues, love triangles, many cheesy "dramatic" scenes and exploitative Roulette sequences (why's everyone in Saigaon playing Roulette?) which Cimino shoe-horned from another Las Vegas themed script he was working on. Some critics, like Jonathan Rosenbaum, spotted the film's hokiness right away. Pulitzer Prize winner Peter Arnett would call it a "simplistic lie". As with most war movies, the overriding message is "look what they did to us". Cimino perpetuates the racist stereotype that sustained much of America's involvement in Indochina, and hides behind designer madness and much irrationality. Compare to Pontecorvo's "Burn!", which offered a clear analysis of imperialist expansion, and "In the Year of the Pig" and "Hearts and Minds", two documentaries which the CIA waged war upon and whose theatres met with bomb threats. In 2012, the Pentagon began The Vietnam War Commemoration Project, a 13 year, 65 million dollar propaganda effort to clean up the image of the Vietnam war. What are they covering up? The fact that the North Vietnamese constituted a political movement with near total local, popular support, that the US artificially divided Vietnam in disregard of Geneva negotiations (becase Eisenhower knew over 80 percent of the population would vote for Ho Chi Minh), that the US put in place and backed psycho puppet leaders, that even the South didn't support the US, that the US did everything it could to prevent unification and scuttle elections, that 4 million Vietnamese died, that more bombs were dropped than in all previous wars combined, that tens of thousands were assassinated by the CIA's Phoenix Program, that nukes were threatened 13 times, that US land-mines still kill Vietnamese to this day (52000 and counting), that millions of gallons of poison, herbicide and chemicals were used, that US campaigns in Cambodia were directly responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot (himself supported with 89 million dollars) and the genocide which took place afterwards, that the first Tonkin Gulf incident was started by US aggression, that the second never happened, that over five million villagers were forcibly displaced, that political prisoners were jailed/tortured in "tiger cages" and that 90 percent of Northern levees, hospitals, villages, towns and industries were intentionally bombed. The US has similarly destabilised over 80 countries in the past 100 years. And yet here's a film with the NVA torturing small-town Americans. During and after the Iraq war, US soldiers committed suicide at a rate of 1 every 25 hours. This figure doesn't include attempted suicides (roughly 1900 in 2009 alone). In Vietnam, the number of US suicides totalled about 150,000. In real life, these vets were trapped in a double bind, unable to reconcile their belief that their conflict was righteous with their actual deeds; they thus nihilistically self-destructed. Cimino wants you to believe the opposite; that the NVA pushed men to suicide. 3/10  Depressing.

    Read the reviews by date and one can tell which generation knows war and which does not. The effects shown on the characters is what we see on returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Regardless war is still the same and has lasting effects on the participants just as this movie shows. The acting is good because they are all professionals in the true sense of the word. The script is good because all of it is true to some degree for veterans of the Vietnam debacle. the scenes are authentic-. Racist against Vietnamese-it is what it was. The film should be viewed today as a good history lesson for all. The only thing that has changed is that the steel mill has probably closed.

    The Vietnam War which lasted 15 years and ended in 1975, proved to be one of the costliest wars of our time considering its five million casualties, including the lives of over 60,000 US soldiers. Who won that war is no longer important, but the effect that war has to this day is beyond devastating. In what is easily the best and last significant film of his career, director Michael Cimino delivers a film with a prophetic vision just three years after the war ended, and is the first in a string of Vietnam war movies that is still attempted over three decades on.Having also co-written the screenplay, Cimino's story does not entirely focus on battle scenes or the war itself, but in essence, its aftermath on the lives of ordinary people. For this, his narrative spans three hours, of which the first hour is spent in impeccable character development formally introducing his Russian-American characters in a small Pennsylvanian steel-mill suburb. Mike, Nick, Steven, Stanley and John are five buddies in a typical frat-pack where after work hours are spent in male bonding activities of deer hunting and beer lounging. Their last gathering as a group is at Steven's Russian orthodox wedding reception pending Mike, Nick and Steven's enlistment in the Vietnam War. The wedding is a fun filled extravaganza where everyone has more than a good share of the festivities. Yet tell-tale signs of a devastating future are cleverly manifested through the reception, foretelling that things would never be the same again. Cut to war-torn Vietnam, Mike, Nick and Steven are POWs after a short battle sequence succumbing to North Vietnamese guerrilla tactics. Taking advantage over their captor's sadistic torture methods of Russian Roulette and rat infested imprisonment, the trio makes for a daring escape little knowing their physical and mental scars would haunt them for life. In a botched rescue attempt, their party is split and they never really regroup as before the war. Although welcomed back a hero, Mike finds it hard to adjust to his once perky lifestyle. Steven is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair living in total refusal of his family and friends. The crux of the plot surfaces when Mike goes all the way back to hellish Saigon in keeping his earlier promise where he would never leave Nick behind. What he finds is a ghastly excuse for a lifelong friend who has no recollection of their history. Worse, Nick is involved in a major gambling syndicate the likes of which still disturbs Mike: Russian roulette. Interestingly enough, Francis Ford Coppola brought out the critically acclaimed APOCALYPSE NOW just a year after this film, winning two Oscars in the process for his version of the horrifying atrocities during the war in Vietnam. Though Coppola focused mainly on the war, Cimino's film, metaphorically speaking, is an integration of three acts where graphic scenes in Vietnam form the repugnant sausage in an otherwise edible hotdog. And to think, this film was made thirty years before STOP-LOSS and HOME OF THE BRAVE, similar films about war veterans incapable of reverting to ordinary life. But Cimino had already set the tone of things to come, bagging five Academy Awards including "Best Picture" and "Best Director" out of five nominated categories. The Oscar for "Best Actor in a Supporting Role" also went to Christopher Walken for his outstanding role as Nick. Incidentally, this is Walken's first and only Oscar till date. Having secured an Oscar for his supporting role as the young Vito Corleone in Coppola's THE GODFATHER II and nominated for best supporting actor in the Martin Scorsese 1976 cult classic TAXI DRIVER, it isn't surprising that Robert De Niro was also nominated again for "Best Actor in a Leading Role" as Mike. Perhaps playing a mentally unstable Vietnam Veteran in TAXI DRIVER was all the training he required in adapting a similar themed role as the titled deer hunter. Also worth mentioning is a stunning Meryl Streep in her first ever Oscar nominated role as Linda, a passive women caught between Nick's proposal for marriage and Mike's shy charm. Also embedded in the support line up are John Savage as Steven, George Dzundza as the over eccentric John and John Cazale who passed away shortly after his role as Stanley. More than just a multi-award winning movie, this is one of De Niro's and Walken's building blocks to their currently much deserved status as Hollywood veterans. But wrapping up the perfect package goes to Cimino's credit in consideration of the lack of eye-popping special effects of Hollywood yester years. His reliance on stellar acting, perfectly timed suspense in a visionary plot and the birth of a sub-genre ahead of its time justifies why the American Film Institute has praised this film within the "100 Greatest American Movies of all time".

    In 1975, America was leaving Vietnam as the communist Southeast Asia country fell under communist control. Hollywood at the time had already made a Vietnam movie and that film was John Wayne's The Green Berets. That film became the first pro-war film about the Vietnam War. In other words, the war is good. Well, that didn't fit well with the critics. Critics in that time in 1968 wanted a serious movie about the Vietnam War. It wasn't till 1978, about 10 years later, that Hollywood made the first anti-war about the Vietnam War. That film, of course was The Deer Hunter. It told the story about three Pennsylvania steel-workers who are having the time of their lives. Among the ordinary jobs they have, they also have a wedding before they are send to Vietnam to fight. The three men are played, very through and very strong, by Robert De Niro, John Savage and Christopher Walken, who won a Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The three men leave the USA to go to Vietnam. They had no idea what kind of physical and mental destruction awaits them. The three men are forced to play Russian Roulette in a Vietcong hut. They have to survive the war and their aftermath. But, tragedy strikes and changes their lives, forever. As I said before, The Deer Hunter, has a lot of great performances by the three leading men and also, Meryl Streep, who is so effective as the role, Linda. The Deer Hunter took home 5 Oscars, including Best Picture. I felt that the movie works on character development. And, when we see the aftermath of the war, we see the aftermath of the three men. Director Michael Cimino tells this tale of war very thoroughly. Even though it runs 3 hours, it never runs out of steam. And even in the Russian Roulette scene, I felt so choked up that I felt like someone was strangling me. The suspense of that scene put me on edge. There's no doubt in my mind that The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978. After The Deer Hunter, other great Vietnam movies came along. Movies like Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July and Platoon followed. And even when The Deer Hunter was released in 1978, other films told different tales about the war. Go Tell the Spartans was another film that dealt with the topic of the Vietnam War. The Deer Hunter is a shattering, heroic and deeply effective war drama. **** 4 stars.

    Michael Cimino directs this long character study & war picture that follows a group of friends from a wedding, to a deer hunting trip, to finally the Vietnam war and its aftermath. Over three hour film details their lives before & after the war, on both the men and their families. Fine cast includes Robert De Nero, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep, who all deliver heartfelt and believable performances, but the trouble is that the extended POW sequence involving Russian Roulette just feels so bizarre and extreme, that I had a hard time buying it, especially when one of the characters becomes obsessed with it after their ordeal is over. Somehow, this drags the film down, and by the end, instead of feeling emotionally drained(like many of the audience claimed) the film felt emotionally muted, like it had gone too far afield and lost sight of what it was supposed to be about. Still, a minority view I suppose, since it did win an Academy Award for best picture and director.

    Watch this film. The film speaks to the lives we live and i think the director is making a point about free will, or the concept of it. There are choices we get to make in life, and there are situations that are thrust upon us that we have no control over. Going to Vietnam, Getting married, Being the type of hunter who is majestic and believes in a principle ( one shot ) or runs around like a sloppy drunk shooting nonsense into the air... these are the choices that we make in our life. Then there is the gun. You have no choice on if the bullet is in the chamber, or if it is not. The only choice you should have is if you play the game, that choice was taken from these young men which effected them all differently. 1) De Niro plays the idealistic character, the type who believes in things more important than hedonistic pleasure. This is why when he hunts, he uses the one bullet belief, and there is a moment between him and his prey. 2) Walken plays the agnostic type view, he neither hates nor loves the idealism of De Niro, but instead takes no stance on it at first and simply reflects on the beauty of the tree's and wondering if he is an asshole or not. 3) Steve: forget the actor's name, but he represents the boy who never really became a man, his thoughts are never deeply explored, but his actions reveal his thoughts, that he neither holds idealism or can rely strictly on self reflection and earthly delights. the effects of Gun on each: De Niro: De Niro's idealism goes out the window when presented with life or death questions, he is the closest to being a theist in his views and becomes an atheist in that murky rat filled water. We know this when he tells Walken they are going to abandon Steve. De Niro throws any sense of idealism out the window from then on out, and realizes that we cannot make and uphold our's or anyone else's "rules"... that we only have choices and reactions to our situations. De Niro's abandonment of his idealism is what saves him, and why he does not kill the deer at the end, he has learned that life it's self, or the joy of the hunt is the true purpose, and not the idealism of actually killing your prey with one shot. Walken: Walkens character at first can deal with the situation, but becomes stuck in that moment and cannot escape it. He has no idealism to loose, and now the beauty of the tree's has gone, and he has nothing left but self reflection. He cannot get past why the bullet was not in the chamber for him, and must repeat the situation until he feels he has taken control back over his life, of course he can only do this by ending his life. Steve: Steve being the eternal boy he is needs to be saved, cracks first, and is dependent on everyone else. In the end we realize our own traditions and idealism or lack there of lead us to certain points, some we can over come and some we cannot. De Niro comes out the best because he see's this and reacts to it, Walken and Steve are forever stuck in that moment. This is how the movie effected me personally.

    I want to say few words for this movie which is landmark for the end of Vietnam era. I know that it hurts for the American people to recall over and over again for this social experiment, so to call. I am not an American and if it was 40 years ago I would have never had a chance to write this review. As an Easterner we people from the Soviet bloc showed solidarity to the fight of the Vietnamese people and strangely enough I remember that some alimony and other salvation stuff was gathered from the civil population. I also know but can not support it with figures that the Warsaw Pact had sent some military force to Northern Vietnam; so it was not war America vs. Vietnam, but America vs. Vietnam plus Allies. Those are general truths and I am not withholding some state secret. Now let's talk about the movie. If it was only for the death of one of the principal actors in the film (John Cazale), that movie wouldn't have been worthy. Unfortunately, the movie received much spit from its critics and intentionally didn't received its full acclaim as first one shot at the war theater - before "Apocalypse Now" and before the Rambo series, etc. Bad luck was also that at Oscar 1979 it had to compete with another equally shattering film ("Midnight Express" - about life in Turkish prisons) which I think that is no less valuable than the Vietnamese saga, with remarkable supportive role from John Hurt. And also "Superman" (1978) was there and how is it possible not to receive a nickel. Thank you!

    It seems criminal, giving a multiple Oscar winner a negative review, yet alone an extremely loathing one. But the Academy has made some mistakes in the past in my eyes. Giving Sean Penn an Oscar nomination for I Am Sam or awarding Mel Gibson's Braveheart Best Picture. Michael Cimino's 'masterpiece' The Deer Hunter is one such example of a motion picture that gained massive praise on its original release but is, in my eyes, a dreadful hackneyed melodrama that tries to come across as meaningful and poignant when it is in reality, xenophobic, pretentious, boring and self-indulgent. It fails to be in anyway enduring nor does it make up for its three hour running length. It's honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen and even when I watched it again, I still couldn't fathom it. Three Russian-American friends, Mike, Nick and Steven, living in a small town in Pennyslvania, are about to go off to fight in Vietnam. Steven is getting married and Nick is in a loving relationship with Linda whom Mike is secretly in love with. Before heading off to fight in the war, the trio and their friends attend Steven's wedding and go off deer hunting. However, in Vietnam, they are trapped in terrible conditions as the Vietnamese endlessly torment them with games of Russian roulette. They manage to escape with Mike and Steven returning to their home with Nick staying in Saigon, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and now playing Russian roulette professionally. Steven ends up in a veteran's home whilst Mike tries to return to Saigon to save Nick as the city is about to fall to the Vietnamese. The Deer Hunter can be described as a blatant propaganda film. Cimino tries to tell the story from the perspective of the American soldiers who fight in the war and the effects of it. The Vietnamese side of the conflict is in no way explored though. They are portrayed as mindless child-killing gamblers with no remorse or mercy in their treatment of U.S soldiers. The playing Russian roulette element never occurred in the war and just appears to give the characters some traumatic experience to go through. The film comes across as a jingoistic feature that tries to appeal to the American audience. It's understandable why the film would've been critically acclaimed on its original release as America was still recovering from the war and seeing the Vietnamese as a group of sadistic monsters gave them some validity in their anger and despair. Nowadays, however, this comes across as manipulative nonsense trying to pass off as a compelling melodrama. The film feels too needlessly long at three hours and feels even longer than that. Many long films make up for their running lengths like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Seven Samurai and The Godfather Part II. But because Cimino uses an abundance of long unedited shots that should last for a few seconds, the film feels more like three days as opposed to three hours. The scene where they go hunting and annoy one of their friends by throwing his boots off the car is profoundly tedious and in no way engaging. The film also seems to want to talk about the effects of the war on American soldiers but if there is any underlying message throughout it, Cimino didn't convey it well. Maybe he felt that showing these men screaming and going hysterical would give the audience some dramatic heft to show the effects of the conflict. The film also consists of tediously repetitive dialogue with characters mumbling a bunch of crap at each other and getting drunk, singing and dancing like a bunch of idiots. The first act where the characters are all celebrating borders on boring and headache-inducing. The actors here don't do much to give their flatly written and one- dimensional characters any weight. Robert De Niro mumbles his way through the script, like a drunk. Christopher Walken just plays himself here though less entertaining than he normally is. John Savage's acting flip-flops between dull and random screaming. Meryl Streep doesn't do much with her character either to make her any identifiable. To the credit of these actors who have pretty much done great in other films, the faults mainly lie with the script and the direction and the fact that their characters barely have any personality. The Deer Hunter is one of those films that has no substance nor any dignity to accommodate the overly-long running length or even convey the effects of war properly, only by showing that it is damaging to American soldiers and it's all the Vietnamese' fault. It's a thoroughly hateful and tedious work and not something that I would like to revisit.

    This movie starts well but as soon as the protagonists get to Vietnam it just gets very - silly. The Soviets staged a walkout at the Berlin Film Festival when this was shown. I'm not surprised. The first Vietnamese depicted on the screen commits an atrocity on civilian women and children (that way we know who the baddies are). He pays for his crime, however, when the hero burns him alive - hooray! Then, all the heroes are captured by the enemy. Oh no! How could this happen? We are spared the humiliation of viewing this terrible event because next up is a hideous torture scene. Who knew that the Commies played Russian roulette with their (highly valuable) US prisoners? Never fear, the heroes kill their captors and escape! Luckily they can just float down the river to be picked up - then dropped back in the river? Oh well - back to Saigon where they are able to overcome the trauma of captivity - by playing some more Russian roulette? And so it goes until the movie ends with a rousing rendition of "God Bless America" - the US must have won the war after all! Oscars for everybody!! ** SPOILERS ** Some deer were injured in the making of this movie ** SPOILERS **

    The Deer Hunter is the type of movie that when you watch it you can't have anything else on your mind. Today's generation more often than not use their phones while they watch a movie, distracting them from the story at hand by text messages, social networking sites, and emails. When you watch The Deer Hunter, turn your phones off, put away the snacks, and empty your mind completely of any lingering predicaments they may have happened prior to sitting down to watch the film. The only way to experience The Deer Hunter is to live it. Director Michael Cimno is the showcased party from The Deer Hunter. The loose narrative allows Cimno to fully capture the characters, their struggles, and mental scarring. The script isn't cemented, which gives Cimno a lot of freedom. It's almost like we're watching a documentary of this group of people, the storytelling isn't very structured...but it works. I normally despise movies that don't get to the point they're trying to make, but The Deer Hunter struck me in a way no film of its nature has done before. It invested me into the lives of the characters, I really cared about what was going on, in a movie where not much does go on. The power Cimmo releases on the screen is admirable. The film's split into three segregated pieces: before war, during war, and after war. The Deer Hunter holds up the war to our faces and asks is this necessary? People who didn't go to war, get the point-blank experience of it through the film's gripping, raw, distressing transcendence of feelings. War changes people, we get to live that fully with The Deer Hunter. The first act, we get to know these characters as people. We identify with their day-to-day lives, living situations, and friendships. During the war, Cimno hits us with some painful scenes, including the iconic Russian Roulette sequence. It's an unforgettable, incredibly crafted scene in not just this film, but the war genre. It explores male sensitivity and the bonds that ignite in wartime. When the third act rolls around, it's about healing the scars from the war. You can see the scars every where you look. It's a catharsis of pain, loss, and mental disfigurement. Upon its release, controversy ensued due to the Russian Roulette topic covered heavily throughout the film. Apparently there was never any documented use of Russian Roulette and therefore the film was "lying" to the viewer. I dissent these accusations because The Deer Hunter isn't giving a play-by-play shot of the Vietnam war. It's main purpose is to depict the impact the war had on the men serving our country and their families. The Deer Hunter is an fictional, emotionally driven movie, not a news special describing the types of torture methods used in the war. The Deer Hunter would almost be like an acting exercise for its principle actors. Getting to live the big picture of a character, not just the crux of a story that we usually get in movies. The actors here are allowed to experiment with the characters at uninteresting moments and still create drama within those moments. When Robert De Niro puts himself in a role, he doesn't look back. De Niro's strength and susceptibility in the war scenes move your heart around in your chest. Meryl Streep gets to show off in her first meaty role, supplying each moment with a different level of emotion. Christopher Walken has the most complex character and performance; the transformation that his character lives is astounding. The actors bring this movie to life by falling back on the mission statement of the film: to show the effects of war on human beings. There's a specific technique Cimno uses with The Deer Hunter: lingering emotion. As the scene lingers on, emotion grows, and you become overwhelmed by the amount of response you feel in your heart to this film. The extreme length has been highly criticized by moviegoers, and usually I'm one of those people complaining about the unnecessary length in a movie, but here it feels right and is wonderfully fulfilling. Sure, a trim here or there wouldn't have hurt, but Cimno gets away with it because of the robust sentiment. It's a destructive piece that tears into your soul. Not having a distinctive narrative voice, the Cimno is the one who makes the movie the commanding experience that is The Deer Hunter. Some shots are so intense and violent that you shutter at the pain you're watching, but others are beautifully moving it creates a peace in our mind. Filled with numerous sublime performances, a tremendous view on war, and moving tales of the human condition, The Deer Hunter only has a few missteps along the way. You won't soon forget this film, as it will be tugging at your emotion strings long after you complete the movie. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    "The story we tell ourselves about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing, is a lie. The truth lies outside, in what we do." - Zizek A near scene-for-scene remake of 1939's "The Four Feathers", Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter" tells the story of several friends (Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken) from small town Pennsylvania. Early sequences watch as the gang work in a steel mill, congregate and go on hunting expeditions. Cimino's photography, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, is grand throughout, but the film quickly nosedives into pretentious, unintentionally funny territory. Cimino indulges in a prolonged wedding sequence (cribbed from Coppola who cribbed from Visconti), filters "Best Years of Our Lives" through a Vietnam era prism, has DeNiro run about naked like a Method Actor fishing for Oscars, and treats us to a forced sequence in which our heroes play Chopin on a piano whilst looking REALLY REALLY SERIOUS. This is a deep movie, see. The hell of Industrial America then becomes the hell of the Vietnam War. Here our heroes, now American soldiers, watch North Vietnamese savages kill civilians. They're then captured by the Vietnamese and made to play Russian Roulette. They survive this ordeal, but Walken's character is pushed into madness and begins to play Russian Roulette for money in a Saigon gambling hall. Symbolically unable to escape the damage done by Vietnam, he spends six years there, gambling with bullets. You'd think the law of averages would catch up with him, but no. "Don't leave me over there," Walken tells his buddy DeNiro, which leads to DeNiro having the longest delayed reaction in the history of cinema. Eight years later he goes back to Saigon in the hopes of finding Walken, a missing person's search which is apparently really easy. They find each other, Walken commits suicide (partially to punish - and prove his love to - "best man" DeNiro), the film ends with a funeral and a silly, unearned scene in which our gang sing "God Bless America". You can feel Cimino straining with every scene to make a GREAT EPIC. The film won five Oscars. Like most Vietnam war movies, "Hunter" hinges on romanticised madness. Deer hunting becomes a metaphor for "virtuous, humane kills" and Russian Roulette becomes a metaphor for the madness inducing chaos of Vietnam. As is typical of racist war films, the Vietnamese are portrayed as grinning (their dialogue is not even Vietnamese), Oriental savages (introduced with propagandistic scenes showing the NVA killing babies and women) and the "reason" for US defeat is sidestepped by making the Vietnam war itself incomprehensible. Where else but in an irrational country could the US lose a war? Whilst several sequences play with irony (Russian-Americans playing Russian roulette etc), Cimino's tale is one of solemn tragedy. An account of what evil, sadistic, barbaric Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans, the film, like "Apocalypse Now", oozes macho self pity with a dash of counter-culture disillusionment and strained appeals to high culture (Conrad, Eliot, Chopin songs, Orthodox hymns etc). The film is silly elsewhere, with random helicopter rescues, love triangles, many cheesy "dramatic" scenes and exploitative Roulette sequences (why's everyone in Saigaon playing Roulette?) which Cimino shoe-horned from another Las Vegas themed script he was working on. Some critics, like Jonathan Rosenbaum, spotted the film's hokiness right away. Pulitzer Prize winner Peter Arnett would call it a "simplistic lie". As with most war movies, the overriding message is "look what they did to us". Cimino perpetuates the racist stereotype that sustained much of America's involvement in Indochina, and hides behind designer madness and much irrationality. Compare to Pontecorvo's "Burn!", which offered a clear analysis of imperialist expansion, and "In the Year of the Pig" and "Hearts and Minds", two documentaries which the CIA waged war upon and whose theatres met with bomb threats. In 2012, the Pentagon began The Vietnam War Commemoration Project, a 13 year, 65 million dollar propaganda effort to clean up the image of the Vietnam war. What are they covering up? The fact that the North Vietnamese constituted a political movement with near total local, popular support, that the US artificially divided Vietnam in disregard of Geneva negotiations (becase Eisenhower knew over 80 percent of the population would vote for Ho Chi Minh), that the US put in place and backed psycho puppet leaders, that even the South didn't support the US, that the US did everything it could to prevent unification and scuttle elections, that 4 million Vietnamese died, that more bombs were dropped than in all previous wars combined, that tens of thousands were assassinated by the CIA's Phoenix Program, that nukes were threatened 13 times, that US land-mines still kill Vietnamese to this day (52000 and counting), that millions of gallons of poison, herbicide and chemicals were used, that US campaigns in Cambodia were directly responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot (himself supported with 89 million dollars) and the genocide which took place afterwards, that the first Tonkin Gulf incident was started by US aggression, that the second never happened, that over five million villagers were forcibly displaced, that political prisoners were jailed/tortured in "tiger cages" and that 90 percent of Northern levees, hospitals, villages, towns and industries were intentionally bombed. The US has similarly destabilised over 80 countries in the past 100 years. And yet here's a film with the NVA torturing small-town Americans. During and after the Iraq war, US soldiers committed suicide at a rate of 1 every 25 hours. This figure doesn't include attempted suicides (roughly 1900 in 2009 alone). In Vietnam, the number of US suicides totalled about 150,000. In real life, these vets were trapped in a double bind, unable to reconcile their belief that their conflict was righteous with their actual deeds; they thus nihilistically self-destructed. Cimino wants you to believe the opposite; that the NVA pushed men to suicide. 3/10  Depressing.

    Read the reviews by date and one can tell which generation knows war and which does not. The effects shown on the characters is what we see on returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Regardless war is still the same and has lasting effects on the participants just as this movie shows. The acting is good because they are all professionals in the true sense of the word. The script is good because all of it is true to some degree for veterans of the Vietnam debacle. the scenes are authentic-. Racist against Vietnamese-it is what it was. The film should be viewed today as a good history lesson for all. The only thing that has changed is that the steel mill has probably closed.

    The Vietnam War which lasted 15 years and ended in 1975, proved to be one of the costliest wars of our time considering its five million casualties, including the lives of over 60,000 US soldiers. Who won that war is no longer important, but the effect that war has to this day is beyond devastating. In what is easily the best and last significant film of his career, director Michael Cimino delivers a film with a prophetic vision just three years after the war ended, and is the first in a string of Vietnam war movies that is still attempted over three decades on.Having also co-written the screenplay, Cimino's story does not entirely focus on battle scenes or the war itself, but in essence, its aftermath on the lives of ordinary people. For this, his narrative spans three hours, of which the first hour is spent in impeccable character development formally introducing his Russian-American characters in a small Pennsylvanian steel-mill suburb. Mike, Nick, Steven, Stanley and John are five buddies in a typical frat-pack where after work hours are spent in male bonding activities of deer hunting and beer lounging. Their last gathering as a group is at Steven's Russian orthodox wedding reception pending Mike, Nick and Steven's enlistment in the Vietnam War. The wedding is a fun filled extravaganza where everyone has more than a good share of the festivities. Yet tell-tale signs of a devastating future are cleverly manifested through the reception, foretelling that things would never be the same again. Cut to war-torn Vietnam, Mike, Nick and Steven are POWs after a short battle sequence succumbing to North Vietnamese guerrilla tactics. Taking advantage over their captor's sadistic torture methods of Russian Roulette and rat infested imprisonment, the trio makes for a daring escape little knowing their physical and mental scars would haunt them for life. In a botched rescue attempt, their party is split and they never really regroup as before the war. Although welcomed back a hero, Mike finds it hard to adjust to his once perky lifestyle. Steven is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair living in total refusal of his family and friends. The crux of the plot surfaces when Mike goes all the way back to hellish Saigon in keeping his earlier promise where he would never leave Nick behind. What he finds is a ghastly excuse for a lifelong friend who has no recollection of their history. Worse, Nick is involved in a major gambling syndicate the likes of which still disturbs Mike: Russian roulette. Interestingly enough, Francis Ford Coppola brought out the critically acclaimed APOCALYPSE NOW just a year after this film, winning two Oscars in the process for his version of the horrifying atrocities during the war in Vietnam. Though Coppola focused mainly on the war, Cimino's film, metaphorically speaking, is an integration of three acts where graphic scenes in Vietnam form the repugnant sausage in an otherwise edible hotdog. And to think, this film was made thirty years before STOP-LOSS and HOME OF THE BRAVE, similar films about war veterans incapable of reverting to ordinary life. But Cimino had already set the tone of things to come, bagging five Academy Awards including "Best Picture" and "Best Director" out of five nominated categories. The Oscar for "Best Actor in a Supporting Role" also went to Christopher Walken for his outstanding role as Nick. Incidentally, this is Walken's first and only Oscar till date. Having secured an Oscar for his supporting role as the young Vito Corleone in Coppola's THE GODFATHER II and nominated for best supporting actor in the Martin Scorsese 1976 cult classic TAXI DRIVER, it isn't surprising that Robert De Niro was also nominated again for "Best Actor in a Leading Role" as Mike. Perhaps playing a mentally unstable Vietnam Veteran in TAXI DRIVER was all the training he required in adapting a similar themed role as the titled deer hunter. Also worth mentioning is a stunning Meryl Streep in her first ever Oscar nominated role as Linda, a passive women caught between Nick's proposal for marriage and Mike's shy charm. Also embedded in the support line up are John Savage as Steven, George Dzundza as the over eccentric John and John Cazale who passed away shortly after his role as Stanley. More than just a multi-award winning movie, this is one of De Niro's and Walken's building blocks to their currently much deserved status as Hollywood veterans. But wrapping up the perfect package goes to Cimino's credit in consideration of the lack of eye-popping special effects of Hollywood yester years. His reliance on stellar acting, perfectly timed suspense in a visionary plot and the birth of a sub-genre ahead of its time justifies why the American Film Institute has praised this film within the "100 Greatest American Movies of all time".
