    Private detective Philip Marlowe is hired to deal with a case of blackmail but before the film is over he'll discover the case is really about more than that and the body count will rise quickly. Elderly General Sternwood is being blackmailed because of his wayward daughter Carmen's gambling. He mentioned that when this happened before his friend Sean Regan handled it but he has disappeared; apparently with the wife of a local casino owner and gangster. It isn't long before Marlowe finds the blackmailer but he is shot and killed before he can confront him. As the case deepens people try to warn him off but inevitably he doesn't back down even after taking a beating or two. While investigating the case Marlowe also finds himself getting closer the Carmen's older sister; Vivian even though at first they don't get on. This film is one of Bogart's best; he plays Marlowe in a way that makes the character seem slightly vulnerable despite his tough manner; he also has the lightness to deliver laugh out loud witty lines when required. Leading lady Lauren Bacall did a fine job as Vivian and Martha Vickers positively sizzled as Carmen her opening scene with Bogart was quite seductive! The plot kept moving at a fast pace; as soon as it looked like things might be about to resolved another twist would take the plot in another direction. Director Howard Hawks filmed the movie in a way that gave it a great atmosphere; it manages to be gritty and tense yet still have funny moments and a story that never really drags it may be nearly seventy years old now but it doesn't feel dated; I heartily recommend it.

    I think to analyze this movie, you have to separate the actors, the acting, and the script. I think many people are fooled into thinking this is a great film because it has the magic team -- Bogart and Bacall. Their mere presence, alone, does not a great movie make. As much as I like Bogie in his prime, and respected Bacall in hers, the magic that they made in "To Have And Have Not", "Dark Passage", and "Key Largo" just isn't that evident here. And, in terms of plot, this one rambles, and even the studio felt major improvements needed to be made to make the film appealing to post-war audiences. Now, that's not to say it's a bad film. It's a good film. But, just a "good" film. Not a "great" film". For example, in the house where the primary murder takes place...would Phillip Marlowe really leave his finger prints all over every key piece of evidence? Not if he was a good detective. Would everyone be continually going in and out of the murder house like it was a hotel lobby? I doubt it. Humphrey Bogart is good here...his character sure of himself...with some clever patter to go along with it. Lauren Bacall is good, but not sultry as she is in some other pairings with Bogart, and her character doesn't seem to know which side of her bread is buttered. Martha Vickers, as a foolish young lady, didn't impress. Regis Toomey as a police inspector once again proves he was a dependable character actor. Charles Waldron as the old man trying to protect his family was an interesting character. Louis Heydt has an interesting scene as a somewhat shady guy who isn't as clever as he thinks, and isn't tough enough, either. Elisha Cook is around for a while, but not in the tough role we saw in "The Maltese Falcon". I wish we would have seen more of Dorothy Malone here...very promising scenes that I understand were cut back because she was getting more attention than Lauren Bacall. Another problem with this film is that there are just too many characters to keep them all straight. Sort of like when you get halfway through a book and wish you'd started writing the characters down to keep them all straight. It's not that this is a bad movie. It's good...but not great. It's always interesting watching Humphrey Bogart. A marvelous actor. I recommend watching this movie, but I think the 8 point + rating on IMDb is too high.

    In Los Angeles, the private investigator Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is invited by the wealthy General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) to a meeting at his house. General Sternwood, who lives with his pretty and wild daughters Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall) and Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers), explains that he has been blackmailed by the bookseller Arthur Geiger on Carmen debts in gambling. The general also tells that he had been blackmailed in the past by the scum Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), but his Irish friend and shamus Sean Reagan resolved the situation. Then Sean decided to leave L. A. with Mona Mars (Peggy Knudsen), the wife of casino owner Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), but now Sean has gone missing. Vivian meets Marlowe when he is leaving the house and tells that she had borrowed money from Eddie Mars to pay for photos of Carmen. Marlowe follows Geiger from his bookstore home and when he hears Carmen screaming, he discovers that Geiger is dead, Carmen is doped and also a hidden camera missing the film with photos of Carmen. Marlowe brings Carmen home and when he returns, Geiger's body is vanished. Then Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls (Regis Toomey) invites his friend Marlowe to go with him to see a body of the general's driver in a Packard that has been withdrawn from the pier. Marlowe connects the dots and is evolved by a complex network of blackmails and deaths while Vivian and he fall in love with each other. "The Big Sleep" is a splendid film-noir, actually one of the best I have ever seen, directed by Howard Hawks with a magnificent story of blackmail and deaths and stunning performances. Lauren Bacall is the perfect femme fatale and Humphrey Bogart, my favorite actor ever, has another top-notch performance. The plot has many details and sleazy characters and I intend to see this movie again in a near future to "catch" details that might have gone missing. Last but not the least, I found the explanation of the title in Google that means "death" and is explained in the novel. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "&Agrave; Beira do Abismo" ("On the Edge of the Abyss")

    And it's here, with "The Big Sleep" that Humphrey Bogart puts his signature stamp on Raymond Chandler's greatest character, Philip Marlowe. "The Big Sleep" is a film that, despite its overly complicated plot remains very watchable because of the players and scenes that make up its whole. Bogart is a marvel in this movie, and his scenes with Lauren Bacall's femme fatale are electric. The dialogue is candy to the ears with a plethora of killer one-liners. You feel like your head is spinning when THE END rolls, but it was such a well-written ride, you just don't care. This is a terrific film in arguably Hollywood's greatest period, and Bogey just plays the hell out of the role. Speaking of Bogart, he's a total babe magnet in this movie. The first half is a series of gorgeous women that just come and go with bit parts. It's crazy how Bond-like he becomes. 8.5/10

    The definitive Humphrey Bogart/Lauren Bacall vehicle, The Big Sleep casts Bogart as Raymond Chandler's cynical private eye Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as the female lead in a film about the "process of a criminal investigation, not its results".This is the first film version of Raymond Chandler's novel of the same title. William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman co-wrote the screenplay; and it was directed by Howard Hawks. Summoned to the home of the fabulously wealthy General Sternwood, Marlowe is hired to deal with a blackmailer shaking down the General's sensuous, thumb-sucking daughter Carmen. This earns Marlowe the displeasure of Carmen's sloe-eyed, seemingly straight-laced older sister Vivian, who is fiercely protective of her somewhat addled sibling. As he pursues the case at hand, Marlowe gets mixed up in the murder of Arthur Geiger, a dealer in pornography. He also runs afoul of gambling-house proprietor Eddie Mars, who seems to have some sort of hold over the enigmatic Vivian. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall made screen history together more than once, but they were never more popular than in this film that is witty and sinister, and in an odd way is a realistic portrayal of big-city life with Arabian Nights overtones.The characters have been transferred to the screen with punch by Howard Hawks' production and direction, providing full load of rough, tense action most of the way.This is one movie that every film student should study and every movie lover should watch at least once.A true classic Bogie and Bacall film indeed.

    Featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I recognised this film because of the easy to remember title and the leading actor and leading actress, I was hoping it would be a film worthy for recommendation, from director Howard Hawks (Scarface, Bringing Up Baby, To Have and Have Not, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Monkey Business). Basically dying General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) in Los Angeles hires private-eye detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) to supposedly keep an eye on his daughter Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) who owes many gambling debts to bookseller Arthur Gwynn Geiger (Theodore Von Eltz), but it may in fact be his older daughter Vivian (Lauren Bacall) that needs his help. Marlowe goes to find the bookseller, the shop being looked after by assistant Agnes Louzier (Sonia Darrin), and when he tries to talk to Geiger he finds his body instead, along with a drugged Carmen, and later when he returns the body disappears, and the Sternwood driver is found dead too. Vivian comes to see Marlowe with some blackmail type pictures of Carmen, so he goes back to the bookseller's shop and follows a car to the apartment Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), a gambler who has blackmailed the General, and after returning to talk to Carmen she at first denies any knowledge of the Geiger's murder, but then names Brody as the killer. After an encounter with small-time gangster Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), Marlowe, Vivian and Carmen go to see Brody, with Agnes there too, to get the photos back, but an assailant shoots Brody dead, but the shooter, Geiger's former driver Carol Lundgren (Tommy Rafferty) who killed for revenge. Marlowe needs answers from Mars, and after some stooge work and pressing there is some kind of robbery plot revealed, and Carmen reveals that Mars calls Vivian frequently, and then she tries to seduce him but he refuses to give in to it. There is some kind of murder plot by Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), hired killer Lash Canino (Bob Steele) is sent to kill Agnes or whatever but Marlowe kills him first, and after some more gossip and revelations a meeting is arranged with Mars at Geiger's place. Guns are pulled out as Mars reveals he blackmailed Vivian to claim a crime of murder, in the chase Mars ends up shot accidentally by his own men, Marlowe calls the police and says that the real murder culprit was the gangster, and he assures Vivian that Carmen will get a doctor's help. Also starring Dorothy Malone as Acme Book Shop, Peggy Knudsen as Mona Mars, Regis Toomey as Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls and Charles D. Brown as Norris the Butler. I will absolutely honest and say that I hardly followed any real plot at all, it was pretty complicated, a review even says that it is complex for most people, for the witty script and the performances by real lovers and to-be husband and wife Bogie and Bacall it is a worthwhile classic detective drama. Good!

    The Big Sleep, directed by Howard Hawkins, persistently presents a perplexing but intricate plot line that is filled with sexual tension, speculation, and direct confrontation. The Shamus, Malone, encounters all these matters when he is introduced to the Sternwoods. Carmen, the youngest of daughter of General Sternwood, displays a multitude of sexually promiscuous behaviors. She finds Malone attractive and literally throws herself at him. In that moment Carmen seems raunchy. Her first impression on Malone can easily be abbreviated to less than desirable. Malone comments that the young lassie needs "weaning". The exchanges between Malone and Carmen signify that women need to be supervised because they cannot control themselves. The film also suggests women are cunning. The following decade, the fifties, film undergoes a drastic moral reformation. The depiction of women and their mannerisms in the fifties contradict the behaviors displayed by Carmen. Similarly, Carmen's older sister, Vivian, is forward. Vivian is decisive and sophisticated. She, unlike her hyper-sexual sister, is a tasteful and charming. Vivian and Carmen's interactions with Malone both prove the Sternwood girls are likable. Nevertheless, the affable sisters are jammed in several taboo social circles. Their mischief begins with black mailing and gradually the ladies are snared into relations with gamblers and killers. The unfavorable characters force their presence on the Sternwoods. Malone's hire and personal speculations lead him to solving the disconcerting investigation. Yet, the exploration ends with Vivian and Malone coupling. Even though the plot rifles off seven individuals, the romance manages to develop and transpire during the plot (grouping). It is typical for films to have a romantic aspect. The Big Sleep, no different, also has a romantic component. The spark of the relationship begins at the Sternwood estate. Vivian requests to see Malone and interrogates him. The desire Vivian has for Malone shows when she begins to regularly visit him at his office. The spontaneous run-ins also display the connection between the romantic pair. Through the midst of chaos, protecting a meaningful element in one's life is exposed throughout the big sleep. The spectrum begins with General Sternwood's desired protection of his daughters and extends to Malone's protection of Vivian as a romantic partner. There is also the protection of friends, sibling, and image. The desire to have security seems inevitable. Every person yearns for the proper safety. Some people, Malone and Vivian, find that safety in the love for a romantic partner.

    Unusually for me, this is a rare film where I have read the source novel before viewing the film - it's normally the other way around. Still, this classic film noir is pretty enjoyable in its own right even if the book's complex plot makes following things a touch tricky at times. But what really elevates this film, and what the studio knew at the time given their prominence in the publicity, is the electric chemistry between screen idols Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. It is a joy to watch and lifts what might have been a fairly plodding crime caper into the stuff of legend. Bogart is perfect as Philip Marlowe, a world-weary private detective summoned to the mansion of the aging General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) who asks Marlows for help when he finds himself being blackmailed. The General is convinced that it has something to do with one of his flighty daughters - the good-time-girl Carmen (Martha Vickers) or the femme fatale Vivian (Bacall). But as Marlowe digs a little deeper, it soon appears that everyone has something to hide. Marlowe's investigations turn over some unpleasant stones and as the case gets ever more complex, Marlowe can't help but feel that Vivian is the key... It may be suffering from some excessively dark scenes due to a lack of colourisation but "The Big Sleep" remains the classic film noir. Bogart simply IS Marlowe, wonderfully ragged at the edges and wears the expression of someone who has seen the worst the world has to offer. As a viewer with little exposure to Bogart's work (most of my movies involve at least one explosion), I had always assumed him to be a somewhat limited actor - but he is unmissable, especially when he and Bacall exchange dialogue that crackles with sexual tension and innuendo. The film is probably the closest to Raymond Chandler's vision and does the story justice, although I personally felt that some characters were underwritten and some dialogue felt difficult to understand. Maybe some of the technical advancements that have been made over the last seventy years could help iron out these particular issues but they rarely impede on the film as a whole and I can't score a movie lower just because it's old. But then again, that's part of its charm - there's no CG or big fight scenes to wow the audience but it doesn't need them. If anything, it feels more authentic than a modern version might. I still believe that instead of endless sequels or half-baked ideas like "Battleship", something like this could work as a remake - the era has been captured before in the likes of "LA Confidential" and "Road To Perdition" so why wouldn't it work? It's difficult to think how the magic between Bogie and Bacall could be replicated but that's why this movie is very much recommended - some things just can't be replicated.

    Spoilers near the end! My advice is to meet with this gently, have no thought what it's about, let the burden of names and trifle detail flow through you. Use it like you were calibrating the eye to focus. By itself the film is uninteresting and not really worth the energy required to investigate. On the page, I suppose the situation to have been somehow mitigated by Chandler's wit and prose but the plot is all of it disposable. If I kept on the right track, we have three sets of blackmail, six counts of murder, plus a seventh revealed near the end, and all sorts of trickery, fronts, and storymaking between players. But two sets of unconnected circumstances elevate this to something that is required viewing and working with. The Hays Code was one, a simple effect; none of Chandler's titillation about drugs and pornography could ever reach the big screen, so all the sex is staged between a camera concealed inside a statue and us getting to imagine about it. It works better than if it were explicit. The second one is even more incidental, a boozing Faulkner had shown up from Mississippi to write for the movies. Now I don't presume the finished script was either fully by design or by complete lack of it, since Faulkner didn't care beyond a paycheck, rather the result of handing out Chandler's hard and thin sense of reality to a literary giant of the most awesomely intuitive nature, capable for the most multilayered memory. Add to that reshoots of the film several months later, sexual innuendo between Bacall/Bogart spliced in, a key scene where Marlowe explains the plot left on the cutting room floor, and you already have enough pieces of the puzzle missing. Or what I call the Ambersons Effect, after the Welles film. This a situation where no writer is in full control of the complicated story originally intended, quite clearly in our case. The famous story is that Chandler had to be phoned back to shed some light on the cluster of murders. So we get a twist on Chandler's twist of the story, but following Marlowe's assembly of that story, the culprit is shot to pieces before we have a chance to corroborate. We leave the film thinking Marlowe got it right, had to. Here's where the world of allusive accidents kicks into effect. The framing device, this is where Carmen was going to be framed for murder, is a set of photos and a daze that makes her as a viewer susceptible to stories! Isn't this what happens to us each time we sit in the theater? Chandler controlled the device by using sex and drugs to explain, but that is gone. We just have the mystifying stupor, the girl drowsy in a Chinese dress. We have the concealed camera. We have Marlowe's coolly laid-out solution to the story, after the old blueprint of detective fiction - Holmes, Perry Mason, the mode that Chandler wrote in - so quite independent of the viewer. His snappy rat-ta-tat as he explains is followed moments later by the staccato sound of machine-gun fire. But upon reflection, the thing seems a bit off, ordinary logic broken in the process, this creates strangely ambiguous perturbations through a world we just experienced as rational and finite. Marlowe's story is near as possible as everyone else's, but the entire film leading up to it has been believable stories exposed as fabrication. The alternative reading I prefer, is that Marlowe solves blackmail but in doing so suspects he may have fallen for the wrong woman. So he investigates a second plot that is stories made-up by this woman to guard herself, in the end he unspools this in the only way where she turns out innocent and his instincts right all along. This is great the way we have it, a lesson in the relative dynamics of storytelling. When Marlowe resurfaces for The Long Goodbye, the world has outmaneuevered him in complexity. There is a boozing writer and shown to be destructive. The link is Leigh Brackett.

    All the girls/women in Howard Hawk's 1946 Classic 'The Big Sleep' either want to sit in his lap, remove their reading spectacles for or flirt with Humph in one way or another. Even if they don't actually like him, you can almost smell their respect for him. As we all know, the Raymond Chandler story is both complex and intriguing, but that's only half of it. You can stick this movie on umpteen times (as I do) and there's always bits that seem new and fresh, as well as the those that linger long and deep, like a fabulous fragrance. The story, for me is almost second fiddle, though it could easily be first, if I chose it to be. The period detail, the sharp banter and the suspenseful music, the shady characters, the lurking night-time shadows...I could go on. Howard Hawks did make some great films and this must rate as one of his very best. It's become famous for helping to cement Lauren Bacall's life-long relationship with Humph, probably the most loved and respected (and no doubt, envied) courtship in Hollywood history. The black & white photography is remarkably efficient and deceptively simple, yet has all the detail and complexities it needs. There's a real art in making a movie flow so easily and naturally. ALL those who even think of themselves as movie buffs, film-lovers or really anybody, who appreciates a fine film must see The Big Sleep at least once. It does come up on TCM occasionally and it's well worth the effort in tracking down the DVD. Comment Comment | Permalink

Marlowe connects the dots and is evolved by a complex network of blackmails and deaths while Vivian and he fall in love with each other. "The Big Sleep" is a splendid film-noir, actually one of the best I have ever seen, directed by Howard Hawks with a magnificent story of blackmail and deaths and stunning performances. Lauren Bacall is the perfect femme fatale and Humphrey Bogart, my favorite actor ever, has another top-notch performance. The plot has many details and sleazy characters and I intend to see this movie again in a near future to "catch" details that might have gone missing. Last but not the least, I found the explanation of the title in Google that means "death" and is explained in the novel. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "&Agrave; Beira do Abismo" ("On the Edge of the Abyss")

    And it's here, with "The Big Sleep" that Humphrey Bogart puts his signature stamp on Raymond Chandler's greatest character, Philip Marlowe. "The Big Sleep" is a film that, despite its overly complicated plot remains very watchable because of the players and scenes that make up its whole. Bogart is a marvel in this movie, and his scenes with Lauren Bacall's femme fatale are electric. The dialogue is candy to the ears with a plethora of killer one-liners. You feel like your head is spinning when THE END rolls, but it was such a well-written ride, you just don't care. This is a terrific film in arguably Hollywood's greatest period, and Bogey just plays the hell out of the role. Speaking of Bogart, he's a total babe magnet in this movie. The first half is a series of gorgeous women that just come and go with bit parts. It's crazy how Bond-like he becomes. 8.5/10

    The definitive Humphrey Bogart/Lauren Bacall vehicle, The Big Sleep casts Bogart as Raymond Chandler's cynical private eye Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as the female lead in a film about the "process of a criminal investigation, not its results".This is the first film version of Raymond Chandler's novel of the same title. William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman co-wrote the screenplay; and it was directed by Howard Hawks. Summoned to the home of the fabulously wealthy General Sternwood, Marlowe is hired to deal with a blackmailer shaking down the General's sensuous, thumb-sucking daughter Carmen. This earns Marlowe the displeasure of Carmen's sloe-eyed, seemingly straight-laced older sister Vivian, who is fiercely protective of her somewhat addled sibling. As he pursues the case at hand, Marlowe gets mixed up in the murder of Arthur Geiger, a dealer in pornography. He also runs afoul of gambling-house proprietor Eddie Mars, who seems to have some sort of hold over the enigmatic Vivian. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall made screen history together more than once, but they were never more popular than in this film that is witty and sinister, and in an odd way is a realistic portrayal of big-city life with Arabian Nights overtones.The characters have been transferred to the screen with punch by Howard Hawks' production and direction, providing full load of rough, tense action most of the way.This is one movie that every film student should study and every movie lover should watch at least once.A true classic Bogie and Bacall film indeed.

    Featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I recognised this film because of the easy to remember title and the leading actor and leading actress, I was hoping it would be a film worthy for recommendation, from director Howard Hawks (Scarface, Bringing Up Baby, To Have and Have Not, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Monkey Business). Basically dying General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) in Los Angeles hires private-eye detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) to supposedly keep an eye on his daughter Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) who owes many gambling debts to bookseller Arthur Gwynn Geiger (Theodore Von Eltz), but it may in fact be his older daughter Vivian (Lauren Bacall) that needs his help. Marlowe goes to find the bookseller, the shop being looked after by assistant Agnes Louzier (Sonia Darrin), and when he tries to talk to Geiger he finds his body instead, along with a drugged Carmen, and later when he returns the body disappears, and the Sternwood driver is found dead too. Vivian comes to see Marlowe with some blackmail type pictures of Carmen, so he goes back to the bookseller's shop and follows a car to the apartment Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), a gambler who has blackmailed the General, and after returning to talk to Carmen she at first denies any knowledge of the Geiger's murder, but then names Brody as the killer. After an encounter with small-time gangster Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), Marlowe, Vivian and Carmen go to see Brody, with Agnes there too, to get the photos back, but an assailant shoots Brody dead, but the shooter, Geiger's former driver Carol Lundgren (Tommy Rafferty) who killed for revenge. Marlowe needs answers from Mars, and after some stooge work and pressing there is some kind of robbery plot revealed, and Carmen reveals that Mars calls Vivian frequently, and then she tries to seduce him but he refuses to give in to it. There is some kind of murder plot by Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), hired killer Lash Canino (Bob Steele) is sent to kill Agnes or whatever but Marlowe kills him first, and after some more gossip and revelations a meeting is arranged with Mars at Geiger's place. Guns are pulled out as Mars reveals he blackmailed Vivian to claim a crime of murder, in the chase Mars ends up shot accidentally by his own men, Marlowe calls the police and says that the real murder culprit was the gangster, and he assures Vivian that Carmen will get a doctor's help. Also starring Dorothy Malone as Acme Book Shop, Peggy Knudsen as Mona Mars, Regis Toomey as Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls and Charles D. Brown as Norris the Butler. I will absolutely honest and say that I hardly followed any real plot at all, it was pretty complicated, a review even says that it is complex for most people, for the witty script and the performances by real lovers and to-be husband and wife Bogie and Bacall it is a worthwhile classic detective drama. Good!

    The Big Sleep, directed by Howard Hawkins, persistently presents a perplexing but intricate plot line that is filled with sexual tension, speculation, and direct confrontation. The Shamus, Malone, encounters all these matters when he is introduced to the Sternwoods. Carmen, the youngest of daughter of General Sternwood, displays a multitude of sexually promiscuous behaviors. She finds Malone attractive and literally throws herself at him. In that moment Carmen seems raunchy. Her first impression on Malone can easily be abbreviated to less than desirable. Malone comments that the young lassie needs "weaning". The exchanges between Malone and Carmen signify that women need to be supervised because they cannot control themselves. The film also suggests women are cunning. The following decade, the fifties, film undergoes a drastic moral reformation. The depiction of women and their mannerisms in the fifties contradict the behaviors displayed by Carmen. Similarly, Carmen's older sister, Vivian, is forward. Vivian is decisive and sophisticated. She, unlike her hyper-sexual sister, is a tasteful and charming. Vivian and Carmen's interactions with Malone both prove the Sternwood girls are likable. Nevertheless, the affable sisters are jammed in several taboo social circles. Their mischief begins with black mailing and gradually the ladies are snared into relations with gamblers and killers. The unfavorable characters force their presence on the Sternwoods. Malone's hire and personal speculations lead him to solving the disconcerting investigation. Yet, the exploration ends with Vivian and Malone coupling. Even though the plot rifles off seven individuals, the romance manages to develop and transpire during the plot (grouping). It is typical for films to have a romantic aspect. The Big Sleep, no different, also has a romantic component. The spark of the relationship begins at the Sternwood estate. Vivian requests to see Malone and interrogates him. The desire Vivian has for Malone shows when she begins to regularly visit him at his office. The spontaneous run-ins also display the connection between the romantic pair. Through the midst of chaos, protecting a meaningful element in one's life is exposed throughout the big sleep. The spectrum begins with General Sternwood's desired protection of his daughters and extends to Malone's protection of Vivian as a romantic partner. There is also the protection of friends, sibling, and image. The desire to have security seems inevitable. Every person yearns for the proper safety. Some people, Malone and Vivian, find that safety in the love for a romantic partner.

    Unusually for me, this is a rare film where I have read the source novel before viewing the film - it's normally the other way around. Still, this classic film noir is pretty enjoyable in its own right even if the book's complex plot makes following things a touch tricky at times. But what really elevates this film, and what the studio knew at the time given their prominence in the publicity, is the electric chemistry between screen idols Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. It is a joy to watch and lifts what might have been a fairly plodding crime caper into the stuff of legend. Bogart is perfect as Philip Marlowe, a world-weary private detective summoned to the mansion of the aging General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) who asks Marlows for help when he finds himself being blackmailed. The General is convinced that it has something to do with one of his flighty daughters - the good-time-girl Carmen (Martha Vickers) or the femme fatale Vivian (Bacall). But as Marlowe digs a little deeper, it soon appears that everyone has something to hide. Marlowe's investigations turn over some unpleasant stones and as the case gets ever more complex, Marlowe can't help but feel that Vivian is the key... It may be suffering from some excessively dark scenes due to a lack of colourisation but "The Big Sleep" remains the classic film noir. Bogart simply IS Marlowe, wonderfully ragged at the edges and wears the expression of someone who has seen the worst the world has to offer. As a viewer with little exposure to Bogart's work (most of my movies involve at least one explosion), I had always assumed him to be a somewhat limited actor - but he is unmissable, especially when he and Bacall exchange dialogue that crackles with sexual tension and innuendo. The film is probably the closest to Raymond Chandler's vision and does the story justice, although I personally felt that some characters were underwritten and some dialogue felt difficult to understand. Maybe some of the technical advancements that have been made over the last seventy years could help iron out these particular issues but they rarely impede on the film as a whole and I can't score a movie lower just because it's old. But then again, that's part of its charm - there's no CG or big fight scenes to wow the audience but it doesn't need them. If anything, it feels more authentic than a modern version might. I still believe that instead of endless sequels or half-baked ideas like "Battleship", something like this could work as a remake - the era has been captured before in the likes of "LA Confidential" and "Road To Perdition" so why wouldn't it work? It's difficult to think how the magic between Bogie and Bacall could be replicated but that's why this movie is very much recommended - some things just can't be replicated.

    Spoilers near the end! My advice is to meet with this gently, have no thought what it's about, let the burden of names and trifle detail flow through you. Use it like you were calibrating the eye to focus. By itself the film is uninteresting and not really worth the energy required to investigate. On the page, I suppose the situation to have been somehow mitigated by Chandler's wit and prose but the plot is all of it disposable. If I kept on the right track, we have three sets of blackmail, six counts of murder, plus a seventh revealed near the end, and all sorts of trickery, fronts, and storymaking between players. But two sets of unconnected circumstances elevate this to something that is required viewing and working with. The Hays Code was one, a simple effect; none of Chandler's titillation about drugs and pornography could ever reach the big screen, so all the sex is staged between a camera concealed inside a statue and us getting to imagine about it. It works better than if it were explicit. The second one is even more incidental, a boozing Faulkner had shown up from Mississippi to write for the movies. Now I don't presume the finished script was either fully by design or by complete lack of it, since Faulkner didn't care beyond a paycheck, rather the result of handing out Chandler's hard and thin sense of reality to a literary giant of the most awesomely intuitive nature, capable for the most multilayered memory. Add to that reshoots of the film several months later, sexual innuendo between Bacall/Bogart spliced in, a key scene where Marlowe explains the plot left on the cutting room floor, and you already have enough pieces of the puzzle missing. Or what I call the Ambersons Effect, after the Welles film. This a situation where no writer is in full control of the complicated story originally intended, quite clearly in our case. The famous story is that Chandler had to be phoned back to shed some light on the cluster of murders. So we get a twist on Chandler's twist of the story, but following Marlowe's assembly of that story, the culprit is shot to pieces before we have a chance to corroborate. We leave the film thinking Marlowe got it right, had to. Here's where the world of allusive accidents kicks into effect. The framing device, this is where Carmen was going to be framed for murder, is a set of photos and a daze that makes her as a viewer susceptible to stories! Isn't this what happens to us each time we sit in the theater? Chandler controlled the device by using sex and drugs to explain, but that is gone. We just have the mystifying stupor, the girl drowsy in a Chinese dress. We have the concealed camera. We have Marlowe's coolly laid-out solution to the story, after the old blueprint of detective fiction - Holmes, Perry Mason, the mode that Chandler wrote in - so quite independent of the viewer. His snappy rat-ta-tat as he explains is followed moments later by the staccato sound of machine-gun fire. But upon reflection, the thing seems a bit off, ordinary logic broken in the process, this creates strangely ambiguous perturbations through a world we just experienced as rational and finite. Marlowe's story is near as possible as everyone else's, but the entire film leading up to it has been believable stories exposed as fabrication. The alternative reading I prefer, is that Marlowe solves blackmail but in doing so suspects he may have fallen for the wrong woman. So he investigates a second plot that is stories made-up by this woman to guard herself, in the end he unspools this in the only way where she turns out innocent and his instincts right all along. This is great the way we have it, a lesson in the relative dynamics of storytelling. When Marlowe resurfaces for The Long Goodbye, the world has outmaneuevered him in complexity. There is a boozing writer and shown to be destructive. The link is Leigh Brackett.

    All the girls/women in Howard Hawk's 1946 Classic 'The Big Sleep' either want to sit in his lap, remove their reading spectacles for or flirt with Humph in one way or another. Even if they don't actually like him, you can almost smell their respect for him. As we all know, the Raymond Chandler story is both complex and intriguing, but that's only half of it. You can stick this movie on umpteen times (as I do) and there's always bits that seem new and fresh, as well as the those that linger long and deep, like a fabulous fragrance. The story, for me is almost second fiddle, though it could easily be first, if I chose it to be. The period detail, the sharp banter and the suspenseful music, the shady characters, the lurking night-time shadows...I could go on. Howard Hawks did make some great films and this must rate as one of his very best. It's become famous for helping to cement Lauren Bacall's life-long relationship with Humph, probably the most loved and respected (and no doubt, envied) courtship in Hollywood history. The black & white photography is remarkably efficient and deceptively simple, yet has all the detail and complexities it needs. There's a real art in making a movie flow so easily and naturally. ALL those who even think of themselves as movie buffs, film-lovers or really anybody, who appreciates a fine film must see The Big Sleep at least once. It does come up on TCM occasionally and it's well worth the effort in tracking down the DVD. Comment Comment | Permalink

    Private detective Philip Marlowe is hired to deal with a case of blackmail but before the film is over he'll discover the case is really about more than that and the body count will rise quickly. Elderly General Sternwood is being blackmailed because of his wayward daughter Carmen's gambling. He mentioned that when this happened before his friend Sean Regan handled it but he has disappeared; apparently with the wife of a local casino owner and gangster. It isn't long before Marlowe finds the blackmailer but he is shot and killed before he can confront him. As the case deepens people try to warn him off but inevitably he doesn't back down even after taking a beating or two. While investigating the case Marlowe also finds himself getting closer the Carmen's older sister; Vivian even though at first they don't get on. This film is one of Bogart's best; he plays Marlowe in a way that makes the character seem slightly vulnerable despite his tough manner; he also has the lightness to deliver laugh out loud witty lines when required. Leading lady Lauren Bacall did a fine job as Vivian and Martha Vickers positively sizzled as Carmen her opening scene with Bogart was quite seductive! The plot kept moving at a fast pace; as soon as it looked like things might be about to resolved another twist would take the plot in another direction. Director Howard Hawks filmed the movie in a way that gave it a great atmosphere; it manages to be gritty and tense yet still have funny moments and a story that never really drags it may be nearly seventy years old now but it doesn't feel dated; I heartily recommend it.

    I think to analyze this movie, you have to separate the actors, the acting, and the script. I think many people are fooled into thinking this is a great film because it has the magic team -- Bogart and Bacall. Their mere presence, alone, does not a great movie make. As much as I like Bogie in his prime, and respected Bacall in hers, the magic that they made in "To Have And Have Not", "Dark Passage", and "Key Largo" just isn't that evident here. And, in terms of plot, this one rambles, and even the studio felt major improvements needed to be made to make the film appealing to post-war audiences. Now, that's not to say it's a bad film. It's a good film. But, just a "good" film. Not a "great" film". For example, in the house where the primary murder takes place...would Phillip Marlowe really leave his finger prints all over every key piece of evidence? Not if he was a good detective. Would everyone be continually going in and out of the murder house like it was a hotel lobby? I doubt it. Humphrey Bogart is good here...his character sure of himself...with some clever patter to go along with it. Lauren Bacall is good, but not sultry as she is in some other pairings with Bogart, and her character doesn't seem to know which side of her bread is buttered. Martha Vickers, as a foolish young lady, didn't impress. Regis Toomey as a police inspector once again proves he was a dependable character actor. Charles Waldron as the old man trying to protect his family was an interesting character. Louis Heydt has an interesting scene as a somewhat shady guy who isn't as clever as he thinks, and isn't tough enough, either. Elisha Cook is around for a while, but not in the tough role we saw in "The Maltese Falcon". I wish we would have seen more of Dorothy Malone here...very promising scenes that I understand were cut back because she was getting more attention than Lauren Bacall. Another problem with this film is that there are just too many characters to keep them all straight. Sort of like when you get halfway through a book and wish you'd started writing the characters down to keep them all straight. It's not that this is a bad movie. It's good...but not great. It's always interesting watching Humphrey Bogart. A marvelous actor. I recommend watching this movie, but I think the 8 point + rating on IMDb is too high.

    In Los Angeles, the private investigator Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is invited by the wealthy General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) to a meeting at his house. General Sternwood, who lives with his pretty and wild daughters Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall) and Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers), explains that he has been blackmailed by the bookseller Arthur Geiger on Carmen debts in gambling. The general also tells that he had been blackmailed in the past by the scum Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), but his Irish friend and shamus Sean Reagan resolved the situation. Then Sean decided to leave L. A. with Mona Mars (Peggy Knudsen), the wife of casino owner Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), but now Sean has gone missing. Vivian meets Marlowe when he is leaving the house and tells that she had borrowed money from Eddie Mars to pay for photos of Carmen. Marlowe follows Geiger from his bookstore home and when he hears Carmen screaming, he discovers that Geiger is dead, Carmen is doped and also a hidden camera missing the film with photos of Carmen. Marlowe brings Carmen home and when he returns, Geiger's body is vanished. Then Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls (Regis Toomey) invites his friend Marlowe to go with him to see a body of the general's driver in a Packard that has been withdrawn from the pier. Marlowe connects the dots and is evolved by a complex network of blackmails and deaths while Vivian and he fall in love with each other.

    Unusually for me, this is a rare film where I have read the source novel before viewing the film - it's normally the other way around. Still, this classic film noir is pretty enjoyable in its own right even if the book's complex plot makes following things a touch tricky at times. But what really elevates this film, and what the studio knew at the time given their prominence in the publicity, is the electric chemistry between screen idols Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. It is a joy to watch and lifts what might have been a fairly plodding crime caper into the stuff of legend. Bogart is perfect as Philip Marlowe, a world-weary private detective summoned to the mansion of the aging General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) who asks Marlows for help when he finds himself being blackmailed. The General is convinced that it has something to do with one of his flighty daughters - the good-time-girl Carmen (Martha Vickers) or the femme fatale Vivian (Bacall). But as Marlowe digs a little deeper, it soon appears that everyone has something to hide. Marlowe's investigations turn over some unpleasant stones and as the case gets ever more complex, Marlowe can't help but feel that Vivian is the key... It may be suffering from some excessively dark scenes due to a lack of colourisation but "The Big Sleep" remains the classic film noir. Bogart simply IS Marlowe, wonderfully ragged at the edges and wears the expression of someone who has seen the worst the world has to offer. As a viewer with little exposure to Bogart's work (most of my movies involve at least one explosion), I had always assumed him to be a somewhat limited actor - but he is unmissable, especially when he and Bacall exchange dialogue that crackles with sexual tension and innuendo. The film is probably the closest to Raymond Chandler's vision and does the story justice, although I personally felt that some characters were underwritten and some dialogue felt difficult to understand. Maybe some of the technical advancements that have been made over the last seventy years could help iron out these particular issues but they rarely impede on the film as a whole and I can't score a movie lower just because it's old. But then again, that's part of its charm - there's no CG or big fight scenes to wow the audience but it doesn't need them. If anything, it feels more authentic than a modern version might. I still believe that instead of endless sequels or half-baked ideas like "Battleship", something like this could work as a remake - the era has been captured before in the likes of "LA Confidential" and "Road To Perdition" so why wouldn't it work? It's difficult to think how the magic between Bogie and Bacall could be replicated but that's why this movie is very much recommended - some things just can't be replicated.

    Spoilers near the end! My advice is to meet with this gently, have no thought what it's about, let the burden of names and trifle detail flow through you. Use it like you were calibrating the eye to focus. By itself the film is uninteresting and not really worth the energy required to investigate. On the page, I suppose the situation to have been somehow mitigated by Chandler's wit and prose but the plot is all of it disposable. If I kept on the right track, we have three sets of blackmail, six counts of murder, plus a seventh revealed near the end, and all sorts of trickery, fronts, and storymaking between players. But two sets of unconnected circumstances elevate this to something that is required viewing and working with. The Hays Code was one, a simple effect; none of Chandler's titillation about drugs and pornography could ever reach the big screen, so all the sex is staged between a camera concealed inside a statue and us getting to imagine about it. It works better than if it were explicit. The second one is even more incidental, a boozing Faulkner had shown up from Mississippi to write for the movies. Now I don't presume the finished script was either fully by design or by complete lack of it, since Faulkner didn't care beyond a paycheck, rather the result of handing out Chandler's hard and thin sense of reality to a literary giant of the most awesomely intuitive nature, capable for the most multilayered memory. Add to that reshoots of the film several months later, sexual innuendo between Bacall/Bogart spliced in, a key scene where Marlowe explains the plot left on the cutting room floor, and you already have enough pieces of the puzzle missing. Or what I call the Ambersons Effect, after the Welles film. This a situation where no writer is in full control of the complicated story originally intended, quite clearly in our case. The famous story is that Chandler had to be phoned back to shed some light on the cluster of murders. So we get a twist on Chandler's twist of the story, but following Marlowe's assembly of that story, the culprit is shot to pieces before we have a chance to corroborate. We leave the film thinking Marlowe got it right, had to. Here's where the world of allusive accidents kicks into effect. The framing device, this is where Carmen was going to be framed for murder, is a set of photos and a daze that makes her as a viewer susceptible to stories! Isn't this what happens to us each time we sit in the theater? Chandler controlled the device by using sex and drugs to explain, but that is gone. We just have the mystifying stupor, the girl drowsy in a Chinese dress. We have the concealed camera. We have Marlowe's coolly laid-out solution to the story, after the old blueprint of detective fiction - Holmes, Perry Mason, the mode that Chandler wrote in - so quite independent of the viewer. His snappy rat-ta-tat as he explains is followed moments later by the staccato sound of machine-gun fire. But upon reflection, the thing seems a bit off, ordinary logic broken in the process, this creates strangely ambiguous perturbations through a world we just experienced as rational and finite. Marlowe's story is near as possible as everyone else's, but the entire film leading up to it has been believable stories exposed as fabrication. The alternative reading I prefer, is that Marlowe solves blackmail but in doing so suspects he may have fallen for the wrong woman. So he investigates a second plot that is stories made-up by this woman to guard herself, in the end he unspools this in the only way where she turns out innocent and his instincts right all along. This is great the way we have it, a lesson in the relative dynamics of storytelling. When Marlowe resurfaces for The Long Goodbye, the world has outmaneuevered him in complexity. There is a boozing writer and shown to be destructive. The link is Leigh Brackett.

    All the girls/women in Howard Hawk's 1946 Classic 'The Big Sleep' either want to sit in his lap, remove their reading spectacles for or flirt with Humph in one way or another. Even if they don't actually like him, you can almost smell their respect for him. As we all know, the Raymond Chandler story is both complex and intriguing, but that's only half of it. You can stick this movie on umpteen times (as I do) and there's always bits that seem new and fresh, as well as the those that linger long and deep, like a fabulous fragrance. The story, for me is almost second fiddle, though it could easily be first, if I chose it to be. The period detail, the sharp banter and the suspenseful music, the shady characters, the lurking night-time shadows...I could go on. Howard Hawks did make some great films and this must rate as one of his very best. It's become famous for helping to cement Lauren Bacall's life-long relationship with Humph, probably the most loved and respected (and no doubt, envied) courtship in Hollywood history. The black & white photography is remarkably efficient and deceptively simple, yet has all the detail and complexities it needs. There's a real art in making a movie flow so easily and naturally. ALL those who even think of themselves as movie buffs, film-lovers or really anybody, who appreciates a fine film must see The Big Sleep at least once. It does come up on TCM occasionally and it's well worth the effort in tracking down the DVD. Comment Comment | Permalink

    Private detective Philip Marlowe is hired to deal with a case of blackmail but before the film is over he'll discover the case is really about more than that and the body count will rise quickly. Elderly General Sternwood is being blackmailed because of his wayward daughter Carmen's gambling. He mentioned that when this happened before his friend Sean Regan handled it but he has disappeared; apparently with the wife of a local casino owner and gangster. It isn't long before Marlowe finds the blackmailer but he is shot and killed before he can confront him. As the case deepens people try to warn him off but inevitably he doesn't back down even after taking a beating or two. While investigating the case Marlowe also finds himself getting closer the Carmen's older sister; Vivian even though at first they don't get on. This film is one of Bogart's best; he plays Marlowe in a way that makes the character seem slightly vulnerable despite his tough manner; he also has the lightness to deliver laugh out loud witty lines when required. Leading lady Lauren Bacall did a fine job as Vivian and Martha Vickers positively sizzled as Carmen her opening scene with Bogart was quite seductive! The plot kept moving at a fast pace; as soon as it looked like things might be about to resolved another twist would take the plot in another direction. Director Howard Hawks filmed the movie in a way that gave it a great atmosphere; it manages to be gritty and tense yet still have funny moments and a story that never really drags it may be nearly seventy years old now but it doesn't feel dated; I heartily recommend it.

    I think to analyze this movie, you have to separate the actors, the acting, and the script. I think many people are fooled into thinking this is a great film because it has the magic team -- Bogart and Bacall. Their mere presence, alone, does not a great movie make. As much as I like Bogie in his prime, and respected Bacall in hers, the magic that they made in "To Have And Have Not", "Dark Passage", and "Key Largo" just isn't that evident here. And, in terms of plot, this one rambles, and even the studio felt major improvements needed to be made to make the film appealing to post-war audiences. Now, that's not to say it's a bad film. It's a good film. But, just a "good" film. Not a "great" film". For example, in the house where the primary murder takes place...would Phillip Marlowe really leave his finger prints all over every key piece of evidence? Not if he was a good detective. Would everyone be continually going in and out of the murder house like it was a hotel lobby? I doubt it. Humphrey Bogart is good here...his character sure of himself...with some clever patter to go along with it. Lauren Bacall is good, but not sultry as she is in some other pairings with Bogart, and her character doesn't seem to know which side of her bread is buttered. Martha Vickers, as a foolish young lady, didn't impress. Regis Toomey as a police inspector once again proves he was a dependable character actor. Charles Waldron as the old man trying to protect his family was an interesting character. Louis Heydt has an interesting scene as a somewhat shady guy who isn't as clever as he thinks, and isn't tough enough, either. Elisha Cook is around for a while, but not in the tough role we saw in "The Maltese Falcon". I wish we would have seen more of Dorothy Malone here...very promising scenes that I understand were cut back because she was getting more attention than Lauren Bacall. Another problem with this film is that there are just too many characters to keep them all straight. Sort of like when you get halfway through a book and wish you'd started writing the characters down to keep them all straight. It's not that this is a bad movie. It's good...but not great. It's always interesting watching Humphrey Bogart. A marvelous actor. I recommend watching this movie, but I think the 8 point + rating on IMDb is too high.

    In Los Angeles, the private investigator Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is invited by the wealthy General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) to a meeting at his house. General Sternwood, who lives with his pretty and wild daughters Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall) and Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers), explains that he has been blackmailed by the bookseller Arthur Geiger on Carmen debts in gambling. The general also tells that he had been blackmailed in the past by the scum Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), but his Irish friend and shamus Sean Reagan resolved the situation. Then Sean decided to leave L. A. with Mona Mars (Peggy Knudsen), the wife of casino owner Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), but now Sean has gone missing. Vivian meets Marlowe when he is leaving the house and tells that she had borrowed money from Eddie Mars to pay for photos of Carmen. Marlowe follows Geiger from his bookstore home and when he hears Carmen screaming, he discovers that Geiger is dead, Carmen is doped and also a hidden camera missing the film with photos of Carmen. Marlowe brings Carmen home and when he returns, Geiger's body is vanished. Then Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls (Regis Toomey) invites his friend Marlowe to go with him to see a body of the general's driver in a Packard that has been withdrawn from the pier. Marlowe connects the dots and is evolved by a complex network of blackmails and deaths while Vivian and he fall in love with each other. "The Big Sleep" is a splendid film-noir, actually one of the best I have ever seen, directed by Howard Hawks with a magnificent story of blackmail and deaths and stunning performances. Lauren Bacall is the perfect femme fatale and Humphrey Bogart, my favorite actor ever, has another top-notch performance. The plot has many details and sleazy characters and I intend to see this movie again in a near future to "catch" details that might have gone missing. Last but not the least, I found the explanation of the title in Google that means "death" and is explained in the novel. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "&Agrave; Beira do Abismo" ("On the Edge of the Abyss")

    And it's here, with "The Big Sleep" that Humphrey Bogart puts his signature stamp on Raymond Chandler's greatest character, Philip Marlowe. "The Big Sleep" is a film that, despite its overly complicated plot remains very watchable because of the players and scenes that make up its whole. Bogart is a marvel in this movie, and his scenes with Lauren Bacall's femme fatale are electric. The dialogue is candy to the ears with a plethora of killer one-liners. You feel like your head is spinning when THE END rolls, but it was such a well-written ride, you just don't care. This is a terrific film in arguably Hollywood's greatest period, and Bogey just plays the hell out of the role. Speaking of Bogart, he's a total babe magnet in this movie. The first half is a series of gorgeous women that just come and go with bit parts. It's crazy how Bond-like he becomes. 8.5/10

    The definitive Humphrey Bogart/Lauren Bacall vehicle, The Big Sleep casts Bogart as Raymond Chandler's cynical private eye Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as the female lead in a film about the "process of a criminal investigation, not its results".This is the first film version of Raymond Chandler's novel of the same title. William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman co-wrote the screenplay; and it was directed by Howard Hawks. Summoned to the home of the fabulously wealthy General Sternwood, Marlowe is hired to deal with a blackmailer shaking down the General's sensuous, thumb-sucking daughter Carmen. This earns Marlowe the displeasure of Carmen's sloe-eyed, seemingly straight-laced older sister Vivian, who is fiercely protective of her somewhat addled sibling. As he pursues the case at hand, Marlowe gets mixed up in the murder of Arthur Geiger, a dealer in pornography. He also runs afoul of gambling-house proprietor Eddie Mars, who seems to have some sort of hold over the enigmatic Vivian. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall made screen history together more than once, but they were never more popular than in this film that is witty and sinister, and in an odd way is a realistic portrayal of big-city life with Arabian Nights overtones.The characters have been transferred to the screen with punch by Howard Hawks' production and direction, providing full load of rough, tense action most of the way.This is one movie that every film student should study and every movie lover should watch at least once.A true classic Bogie and Bacall film indeed.

    Featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I recognised this film because of the easy to remember title and the leading actor and leading actress, I was hoping it would be a film worthy for recommendation, from director Howard Hawks (Scarface, Bringing Up Baby, To Have and Have Not, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Monkey Business). Basically dying General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) in Los Angeles hires private-eye detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) to supposedly keep an eye on his daughter Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) who owes many gambling debts to bookseller Arthur Gwynn Geiger (Theodore Von Eltz), but it may in fact be his older daughter Vivian (Lauren Bacall) that needs his help. Marlowe goes to find the bookseller, the shop being looked after by assistant Agnes Louzier (Sonia Darrin), and when he tries to talk to Geiger he finds his body instead, along with a drugged Carmen, and later when he returns the body disappears, and the Sternwood driver is found dead too. Vivian comes to see Marlowe with some blackmail type pictures of Carmen, so he goes back to the bookseller's shop and follows a car to the apartment Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), a gambler who has blackmailed the General, and after returning to talk to Carmen she at first denies any knowledge of the Geiger's murder, but then names Brody as the killer. After an encounter with small-time gangster Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), Marlowe, Vivian and Carmen go to see Brody, with Agnes there too, to get the photos back, but an assailant shoots Brody dead, but the shooter, Geiger's former driver Carol Lundgren (Tommy Rafferty) who killed for revenge. Marlowe needs answers from Mars, and after some stooge work and pressing there is some kind of robbery plot revealed, and Carmen reveals that Mars calls Vivian frequently, and then she tries to seduce him but he refuses to give in to it. There is some kind of murder plot by Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), hired killer Lash Canino (Bob Steele) is sent to kill Agnes or whatever but Marlowe kills him first, and after some more gossip and revelations a meeting is arranged with Mars at Geiger's place. Guns are pulled out as Mars reveals he blackmailed Vivian to claim a crime of murder, in the chase Mars ends up shot accidentally by his own men, Marlowe calls the police and says that the real murder culprit was the gangster, and he assures Vivian that Carmen will get a doctor's help. Also starring Dorothy Malone as Acme Book Shop, Peggy Knudsen as Mona Mars, Regis Toomey as Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls and Charles D. Brown as Norris the Butler. I will absolutely honest and say that I hardly followed any real plot at all, it was pretty complicated, a review even says that it is complex for most people, for the witty script and the performances by real lovers and to-be husband and wife Bogie and Bacall it is a worthwhile classic detective drama. Good!

    The Big Sleep, directed by Howard Hawkins, persistently presents a perplexing but intricate plot line that is filled with sexual tension, speculation, and direct confrontation. The Shamus, Malone, encounters all these matters when he is introduced to the Sternwoods. Carmen, the youngest of daughter of General Sternwood, displays a multitude of sexually promiscuous behaviors. She finds Malone attractive and literally throws herself at him. In that moment Carmen seems raunchy. Her first impression on Malone can easily be abbreviated to less than desirable. Malone comments that the young lassie needs "weaning". The exchanges between Malone and Carmen signify that women need to be supervised because they cannot control themselves. The film also suggests women are cunning. The following decade, the fifties, film undergoes a drastic moral reformation. The depiction of women and their mannerisms in the fifties contradict the behaviors displayed by Carmen. Similarly, Carmen's older sister, Vivian, is forward. Vivian is decisive and sophisticated. She, unlike her hyper-sexual sister, is a tasteful and charming. Vivian and Carmen's interactions with Malone both prove the Sternwood girls are likable. Nevertheless, the affable sisters are jammed in several taboo social circles. Their mischief begins with black mailing and gradually the ladies are snared into relations with gamblers and killers. The unfavorable characters force their presence on the Sternwoods. Malone's hire and personal speculations lead him to solving the disconcerting investigation. Yet, the exploration ends with Vivian and Malone coupling. Even though the plot rifles off seven individuals, the romance manages to develop and transpire during the plot (grouping). It is typical for films to have a romantic aspect. The Big Sleep, no different, also has a romantic component. The spark of the relationship begins at the Sternwood estate. Vivian requests to see Malone and interrogates him. The desire Vivian has for Malone shows when she begins to regularly visit him at his office. The spontaneous run-ins also display the connection between the romantic pair. Through the midst of chaos, protecting a meaningful element in one's life is exposed throughout the big sleep.

There is also the protection of friends, sibling, and image. The desire to have security seems inevitable. Every person yearns for the proper safety. Some people, Malone and Vivian, find that safety in the love for a romantic partner.

This is great the way we have it, a lesson in the relative dynamics of storytelling. When Marlowe resurfaces for The Long Goodbye, the world has outmaneuevered him in complexity. There is a boozing writer and shown to be destructive. The link is Leigh Brackett.

    All the girls/women in Howard Hawk's 1946 Classic 'The Big Sleep' either want to sit in his lap, remove their reading spectacles for or flirt with Humph in one way or another. Even if they don't actually like him, you can almost smell their respect for him. As we all know, the Raymond Chandler story is both complex and intriguing, but that's only half of it. You can stick this movie on umpteen times (as I do) and there's always bits that seem new and fresh, as well as the those that linger long and deep, like a fabulous fragrance. The story, for me is almost second fiddle, though it could easily be first, if I chose it to be. The period detail, the sharp banter and the suspenseful music, the shady characters, the lurking night-time shadows...I could go on. Howard Hawks did make some great films and this must rate as one of his very best. It's become famous for helping to cement Lauren Bacall's life-long relationship with Humph, probably the most loved and respected (and no doubt, envied) courtship in Hollywood history. The black & white photography is remarkably efficient and deceptively simple, yet has all the detail and complexities it needs. There's a real art in making a movie flow so easily and naturally. ALL those who even think of themselves as movie buffs, film-lovers or really anybody, who appreciates a fine film must see The Big Sleep at least once. It does come up on TCM occasionally and it's well worth the effort in tracking down the DVD. Comment Comment | Permalink

    Private detective Philip Marlowe is hired to deal with a case of blackmail but before the film is over he'll discover the case is really about more than that and the body count will rise quickly. Elderly General Sternwood is being blackmailed because of his wayward daughter Carmen's gambling. He mentioned that when this happened before his friend Sean Regan handled it but he has disappeared; apparently with the wife of a local casino owner and gangster. It isn't long before Marlowe finds the blackmailer but he is shot and killed before he can confront him. As the case deepens people try to warn him off but inevitably he doesn't back down even after taking a beating or two. While investigating the case Marlowe also finds himself getting closer the Carmen's older sister; Vivian even though at first they don't get on. This film is one of Bogart's best; he plays Marlowe in a way that makes the character seem slightly vulnerable despite his tough manner; he also has the lightness to deliver laugh out loud witty lines when required. Leading lady Lauren Bacall did a fine job as Vivian and Martha Vickers positively sizzled as Carmen her opening scene with Bogart was quite seductive! The plot kept moving at a fast pace; as soon as it looked like things might be about to resolved another twist would take the plot in another direction. Director Howard Hawks filmed the movie in a way that gave it a great atmosphere; it manages to be gritty and tense yet still have funny moments and a story that never really drags it may be nearly seventy years old now but it doesn't feel dated; I heartily recommend it.

    I think to analyze this movie, you have to separate the actors, the acting, and the script. I think many people are fooled into thinking this is a great film because it has the magic team -- Bogart and Bacall. Their mere presence, alone, does not a great movie make. As much as I like Bogie in his prime, and respected Bacall in hers, the magic that they made in "To Have And Have Not", "Dark Passage", and "Key Largo" just isn't that evident here. And, in terms of plot, this one rambles, and even the studio felt major improvements needed to be made to make the film appealing to post-war audiences. Now, that's not to say it's a bad film. It's a good film. But, just a "good" film. Not a "great" film". For example, in the house where the primary murder takes place...would Phillip Marlowe really leave his finger prints all over every key piece of evidence? Not if he was a good detective. Would everyone be continually going in and out of the murder house like it was a hotel lobby? I doubt it. Humphrey Bogart is good here...his character sure of himself...with some clever patter to go along with it. Lauren Bacall is good, but not sultry as she is in some other pairings with Bogart, and her character doesn't seem to know which side of her bread is buttered. Martha Vickers, as a foolish young lady, didn't impress. Regis Toomey as a police inspector once again proves he was a dependable character actor. Charles Waldron as the old man trying to protect his family was an interesting character. Louis Heydt has an interesting scene as a somewhat shady guy who isn't as clever as he thinks, and isn't tough enough, either. Elisha Cook is around for a while, but not in the tough role we saw in "The Maltese Falcon". I wish we would have seen more of Dorothy Malone here...very promising scenes that I understand were cut back because she was getting more attention than Lauren Bacall. Another problem with this film is that there are just too many characters to keep them all straight. Sort of like when you get halfway through a book and wish you'd started writing the characters down to keep them all straight. It's not that this is a bad movie. It's good...but not great. It's always interesting watching Humphrey Bogart. A marvelous actor. I recommend watching this movie, but I think the 8 point + rating on IMDb is too high.

    In Los Angeles, the private investigator Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is invited by the wealthy General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) to a meeting at his house. General Sternwood, who lives with his pretty and wild daughters Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall) and Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers), explains that he has been blackmailed by the bookseller Arthur Geiger on Carmen debts in gambling. The general also tells that he had been blackmailed in the past by the scum Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), but his Irish friend and shamus Sean Reagan resolved the situation. Then Sean decided to leave L. A. with Mona Mars (Peggy Knudsen), the wife of casino owner Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), but now Sean has gone missing. Vivian meets Marlowe when he is leaving the house and tells that she had borrowed money from Eddie Mars to pay for photos of Carmen. Marlowe follows Geiger from his bookstore home and when he hears Carmen screaming, he discovers that Geiger is dead, Carmen is doped and also a hidden camera missing the film with photos of Carmen. Marlowe brings Carmen home and when he returns, Geiger's body is vanished. Then Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls (Regis Toomey) invites his friend Marlowe to go with him to see a body of the general's driver in a Packard that has been withdrawn from the pier. Marlowe connects the dots and is evolved by a complex network of blackmails and deaths while Vivian and he fall in love with each other. "The Big Sleep" is a splendid film-noir, actually one of the best I have ever seen, directed by Howard Hawks with a magnificent story of blackmail and deaths and stunning performances. Lauren Bacall is the perfect femme fatale and Humphrey Bogart, my favorite actor ever, has another top-notch performance. The plot has many details and sleazy characters and I intend to see this movie again in a near future to "catch" details that might have gone missing. Last but not the least, I found the explanation of the title in Google that means "death" and is explained in the novel. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "&Agrave; Beira do Abismo" ("On the Edge of the Abyss")

    And it's here, with "The Big Sleep" that Humphrey Bogart puts his signature stamp on Raymond Chandler's greatest character, Philip Marlowe. "The Big Sleep" is a film that, despite its overly complicated plot remains very watchable because of the players and scenes that make up its whole. Bogart is a marvel in this movie, and his scenes with Lauren Bacall's femme fatale are electric. The dialogue is candy to the ears with a plethora of killer one-liners. You feel like your head is spinning when THE END rolls, but it was such a well-written ride, you just don't care. This is a terrific film in arguably Hollywood's greatest period, and Bogey just plays the hell out of the role. Speaking of Bogart, he's a total babe magnet in this movie. The first half is a series of gorgeous women that just come and go with bit parts. It's crazy how Bond-like he becomes. 8.5/10

    The definitive Humphrey Bogart/Lauren Bacall vehicle, The Big Sleep casts Bogart as Raymond Chandler's cynical private eye Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as the female lead in a film about the "process of a criminal investigation, not its results".This is the first film version of Raymond Chandler's novel of the same title. William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman co-wrote the screenplay; and it was directed by Howard Hawks. Summoned to the home of the fabulously wealthy General Sternwood, Marlowe is hired to deal with a blackmailer shaking down the General's sensuous, thumb-sucking daughter Carmen. This earns Marlowe the displeasure of Carmen's sloe-eyed, seemingly straight-laced older sister Vivian, who is fiercely protective of her somewhat addled sibling. As he pursues the case at hand, Marlowe gets mixed up in the murder of Arthur Geiger, a dealer in pornography. He also runs afoul of gambling-house proprietor Eddie Mars, who seems to have some sort of hold over the enigmatic Vivian. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall made screen history together more than once, but they were never more popular than in this film that is witty and sinister, and in an odd way is a realistic portrayal of big-city life with Arabian Nights overtones.The characters have been transferred to the screen with punch by Howard Hawks' production and direction, providing full load of rough, tense action most of the way.This is one movie that every film student should study and every movie lover should watch at least once.A true classic Bogie and Bacall film indeed.

    Featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I recognised this film because of the easy to remember title and the leading actor and leading actress, I was hoping it would be a film worthy for recommendation, from director Howard Hawks (Scarface, Bringing Up Baby, To Have and Have Not, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Monkey Business). Basically dying General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) in Los Angeles hires private-eye detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) to supposedly keep an eye on his daughter Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) who owes many gambling debts to bookseller Arthur Gwynn Geiger (Theodore Von Eltz), but it may in fact be his older daughter Vivian (Lauren Bacall) that needs his help. Marlowe goes to find the bookseller, the shop being looked after by assistant Agnes Louzier (Sonia Darrin), and when he tries to talk to Geiger he finds his body instead, along with a drugged Carmen, and later when he returns the body disappears, and the Sternwood driver is found dead too. Vivian comes to see Marlowe with some blackmail type pictures of Carmen, so he goes back to the bookseller's shop and follows a car to the apartment Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), a gambler who has blackmailed the General, and after returning to talk to Carmen she at first denies any knowledge of the Geiger's murder, but then names Brody as the killer. After an encounter with small-time gangster Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), Marlowe, Vivian and Carmen go to see Brody, with Agnes there too, to get the photos back, but an assailant shoots Brody dead, but the shooter, Geiger's former driver Carol Lundgren (Tommy Rafferty) who killed for revenge. Marlowe needs answers from Mars, and after some stooge work and pressing there is some kind of robbery plot revealed, and Carmen reveals that Mars calls Vivian frequently, and then she tries to seduce him but he refuses to give in to it. There is some kind of murder plot by Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), hired killer Lash Canino (Bob Steele) is sent to kill Agnes or whatever but Marlowe kills him first, and after some more gossip and revelations a meeting is arranged with Mars at Geiger's place. Guns are pulled out as Mars reveals he blackmailed Vivian to claim a crime of murder, in the chase Mars ends up shot accidentally by his own men, Marlowe calls the police and says that the real murder culprit was the gangster, and he assures Vivian that Carmen will get a doctor's help. Also starring Dorothy Malone as Acme Book Shop, Peggy Knudsen as Mona Mars, Regis Toomey as Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls and Charles D. Brown as Norris the Butler. I will absolutely honest and say that I hardly followed any real plot at all, it was pretty complicated, a review even says that it is complex for most people, for the witty script and the performances by real lovers and to-be husband and wife Bogie and Bacall it is a worthwhile classic detective drama. Good!

    The Big Sleep, directed by Howard Hawkins, persistently presents a perplexing but intricate plot line that is filled with sexual tension, speculation, and direct confrontation. The Shamus, Malone, encounters all these matters when he is introduced to the Sternwoods. Carmen, the youngest of daughter of General Sternwood, displays a multitude of sexually promiscuous behaviors. She finds Malone attractive and literally throws herself at him. In that moment Carmen seems raunchy. Her first impression on Malone can easily be abbreviated to less than desirable. Malone comments that the young lassie needs "weaning". The exchanges between Malone and Carmen signify that women need to be supervised because they cannot control themselves. The film also suggests women are cunning. The following decade, the fifties, film undergoes a drastic moral reformation. The depiction of women and their mannerisms in the fifties contradict the behaviors displayed by Carmen. Similarly, Carmen's older sister, Vivian, is forward. Vivian is decisive and sophisticated. She, unlike her hyper-sexual sister, is a tasteful and charming. Vivian and Carmen's interactions with Malone both prove the Sternwood girls are likable. Nevertheless, the affable sisters are jammed in several taboo social circles. Their mischief begins with black mailing and gradually the ladies are snared into relations with gamblers and killers. The unfavorable characters force their presence on the Sternwoods. Malone's hire and personal speculations lead him to solving the disconcerting investigation. Yet, the exploration ends with Vivian and Malone coupling. Even though the plot rifles off seven individuals, the romance manages to develop and transpire during the plot (grouping). It is typical for films to have a romantic aspect. The Big Sleep, no different, also has a romantic component. The spark of the relationship begins at the Sternwood estate. Vivian requests to see Malone and interrogates him. The desire Vivian has for Malone shows when she begins to regularly visit him at his office. The spontaneous run-ins also display the connection between the romantic pair. Through the midst of chaos, protecting a meaningful element in one's life is exposed throughout the big sleep. The spectrum begins with General Sternwood's desired protection of his daughters and extends to Malone's protection of Vivian as a romantic partner. There is also the protection of friends, sibling, and image. The desire to have security seems inevitable. Every person yearns for the proper safety. Some people, Malone and Vivian, find that safety in the love for a romantic partner.

    Unusually for me, this is a rare film where I have read the source novel before viewing the film - it's normally the other way around. Still, this classic film noir is pretty enjoyable in its own right even if the book's complex plot makes following things a touch tricky at times. But what really elevates this film, and what the studio knew at the time given their prominence in the publicity, is the electric chemistry between screen idols Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. It is a joy to watch and lifts what might have been a fairly plodding crime caper into the stuff of legend. Bogart is perfect as Philip Marlowe, a world-weary private detective summoned to the mansion of the aging General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) who asks Marlows for help when he finds himself being blackmailed. The General is convinced that it has something to do with one of his flighty daughters - the good-time-girl Carmen (Martha Vickers) or the femme fatale Vivian (Bacall). But as Marlowe digs a little deeper, it soon appears that everyone has something to hide. Marlowe's investigations turn over some unpleasant stones and as the case gets ever more complex, Marlowe can't help but feel that Vivian is the key... It may be suffering from some excessively dark scenes due to a lack of colourisation but "The Big Sleep" remains the classic film noir. Bogart simply IS Marlowe, wonderfully ragged at the edges and wears the expression of someone who has seen the worst the world has to offer. As a viewer with little exposure to Bogart's work (most of my movies involve at least one explosion), I had always assumed him to be a somewhat limited actor - but he is unmissable, especially when he and Bacall exchange dialogue that crackles with sexual tension and innuendo. The film is probably the closest to Raymond Chandler's vision and does the story justice, although I personally felt that some characters were underwritten and some dialogue felt difficult to understand. Maybe some of the technical advancements that have been made over the last seventy years could help iron out these particular issues but they rarely impede on the film as a whole and I can't score a movie lower just because it's old. But then again, that's part of its charm - there's no CG or big fight scenes to wow the audience but it doesn't need them. If anything, it feels more authentic than a modern version might. I still believe that instead of endless sequels or half-baked ideas like "Battleship", something like this could work as a remake - the era has been captured before in the likes of "LA Confidential" and "Road To Perdition" so why wouldn't it work? It's difficult to think how the magic between Bogie and Bacall could be replicated but that's why this movie is very much recommended - some things just can't be replicated.

    Spoilers near the end! My advice is to meet with this gently, have no thought what it's about, let the burden of names and trifle detail flow through you. Use it like you were calibrating the eye to focus. By itself the film is uninteresting and not really worth the energy required to investigate. On the page, I suppose the situation to have been somehow mitigated by Chandler's wit and prose but the plot is all of it disposable. If I kept on the right track, we have three sets of blackmail, six counts of murder, plus a seventh revealed near the end, and all sorts of trickery, fronts, and storymaking between players. But two sets of unconnected circumstances elevate this to something that is required viewing and working with. The Hays Code was one, a simple effect; none of Chandler's titillation about drugs and pornography could ever reach the big screen, so all the sex is staged between a camera concealed inside a statue and us getting to imagine about it. It works better than if it were explicit. The second one is even more incidental, a boozing Faulkner had shown up from Mississippi to write for the movies. Now I don't presume the finished script was either fully by design or by complete lack of it, since Faulkner didn't care beyond a paycheck, rather the result of handing out Chandler's hard and thin sense of reality to a literary giant of the most awesomely intuitive nature, capable for the most multilayered memory. Add to that reshoots of the film several months later, sexual innuendo between Bacall/Bogart spliced in, a key scene where Marlowe explains the plot left on the cutting room floor, and you already have enough pieces of the puzzle missing. Or what I call the Ambersons Effect, after the Welles film. This a situation where no writer is in full control of the complicated story originally intended, quite clearly in our case. The famous story is that Chandler had to be phoned back to shed some light on the cluster of murders. So we get a twist on Chandler's twist of the story, but following Marlowe's assembly of that story, the culprit is shot to pieces before we have a chance to corroborate. We leave the film thinking Marlowe got it right, had to. Here's where the world of allusive accidents kicks into effect. The framing device, this is where Carmen was going to be framed for murder, is a set of photos and a daze that makes her as a viewer susceptible to stories! Isn't this what happens to us each time we sit in the theater? Chandler controlled the device by using sex and drugs to explain, but that is gone. We just have the mystifying stupor, the girl drowsy in a Chinese dress. We have the concealed camera. We have Marlowe's coolly laid-out solution to the story, after the old blueprint of detective fiction - Holmes, Perry Mason, the mode that Chandler wrote in - so quite independent of the viewer. His snappy rat-ta-tat as he explains is followed moments later by the staccato sound of machine-gun fire. But upon reflection, the thing seems a bit off, ordinary logic broken in the process, this creates strangely ambiguous perturbations through a world we just experienced as rational and finite. Marlowe's story is near as possible as everyone else's, but the entire film leading up to it has been believable stories exposed as fabrication. The alternative reading I prefer, is that Marlowe solves blackmail but in doing so suspects he may have fallen for the wrong woman. So he investigates a second plot that is stories made-up by this woman to guard herself, in the end he unspools this in the only way where she turns out innocent and his instincts right all along. This is great the way we have it, a lesson in the relative dynamics of storytelling. When Marlowe resurfaces for The Long Goodbye, the world has outmaneuevered him in complexity. There is a boozing writer and shown to be destructive. The link is Leigh Brackett.

Marlowe brings Carmen home and when he returns, Geiger's body is vanished. Then Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls (Regis Toomey) invites his friend Marlowe to go with him to see a body of the general's driver in a Packard that has been withdrawn from the pier. Marlowe connects the dots and is evolved by a complex network of blackmails and deaths while Vivian and he fall in love with each other. "The Big Sleep" is a splendid film-noir, actually one of the best I have ever seen, directed by Howard Hawks with a magnificent story of blackmail and deaths and stunning performances. Lauren Bacall is the perfect femme fatale and Humphrey Bogart, my favorite actor ever, has another top-notch performance. The plot has many details and sleazy characters and I intend to see this movie again in a near future to "catch" details that might have gone missing. Last but not the least, I found the explanation of the title in Google that means "death" and is explained in the novel. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "&Agrave; Beira do Abismo" ("On the Edge of the Abyss")

    And it's here, with "The Big Sleep" that Humphrey Bogart puts his signature stamp on Raymond Chandler's greatest character, Philip Marlowe. "The Big Sleep" is a film that, despite its overly complicated plot remains very watchable because of the players and scenes that make up its whole. Bogart is a marvel in this movie, and his scenes with Lauren Bacall's femme fatale are electric. The dialogue is candy to the ears with a plethora of killer one-liners. You feel like your head is spinning when THE END rolls, but it was such a well-written ride, you just don't care. This is a terrific film in arguably Hollywood's greatest period, and Bogey just plays the hell out of the role. Speaking of Bogart, he's a total babe magnet in this movie. The first half is a series of gorgeous women that just come and go with bit parts. It's crazy how Bond-like he becomes. 8.5/10

    The definitive Humphrey Bogart/Lauren Bacall vehicle, The Big Sleep casts Bogart as Raymond Chandler's cynical private eye Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as the female lead in a film about the "process of a criminal investigation, not its results".This is the first film version of Raymond Chandler's novel of the same title. William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman co-wrote the screenplay; and it was directed by Howard Hawks. Summoned to the home of the fabulously wealthy General Sternwood, Marlowe is hired to deal with a blackmailer shaking down the General's sensuous, thumb-sucking daughter Carmen. This earns Marlowe the displeasure of Carmen's sloe-eyed, seemingly straight-laced older sister Vivian, who is fiercely protective of her somewhat addled sibling. As he pursues the case at hand, Marlowe gets mixed up in the murder of Arthur Geiger, a dealer in pornography. He also runs afoul of gambling-house proprietor Eddie Mars, who seems to have some sort of hold over the enigmatic Vivian. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall made screen history together more than once, but they were never more popular than in this film that is witty and sinister, and in an odd way is a realistic portrayal of big-city life with Arabian Nights overtones.The characters have been transferred to the screen with punch by Howard Hawks' production and direction, providing full load of rough, tense action most of the way.This is one movie that every film student should study and every movie lover should watch at least once.A true classic Bogie and Bacall film indeed.

    Featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I recognised this film because of the easy to remember title and the leading actor and leading actress, I was hoping it would be a film worthy for recommendation, from director Howard Hawks (Scarface, Bringing Up Baby, To Have and Have Not, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Monkey Business). Basically dying General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) in Los Angeles hires private-eye detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) to supposedly keep an eye on his daughter Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) who owes many gambling debts to bookseller Arthur Gwynn Geiger (Theodore Von Eltz), but it may in fact be his older daughter Vivian (Lauren Bacall) that needs his help. Marlowe goes to find the bookseller, the shop being looked after by assistant Agnes Louzier (Sonia Darrin), and when he tries to talk to Geiger he finds his body instead, along with a drugged Carmen, and later when he returns the body disappears, and the Sternwood driver is found dead too. Vivian comes to see Marlowe with some blackmail type pictures of Carmen, so he goes back to the bookseller's shop and follows a car to the apartment Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), a gambler who has blackmailed the General, and after returning to talk to Carmen she at first denies any knowledge of the Geiger's murder, but then names Brody as the killer. After an encounter with small-time gangster Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), Marlowe, Vivian and Carmen go to see Brody, with Agnes there too, to get the photos back, but an assailant shoots Brody dead, but the shooter, Geiger's former driver Carol Lundgren (Tommy Rafferty) who killed for revenge. Marlowe needs answers from Mars, and after some stooge work and pressing there is some kind of robbery plot revealed, and Carmen reveals that Mars calls Vivian frequently, and then she tries to seduce him but he refuses to give in to it. There is some kind of murder plot by Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), hired killer Lash Canino (Bob Steele) is sent to kill Agnes or whatever but Marlowe kills him first, and after some more gossip and revelations a meeting is arranged with Mars at Geiger's place. Guns are pulled out as Mars reveals he blackmailed Vivian to claim a crime of murder, in the chase Mars ends up shot accidentally by his own men, Marlowe calls the police and says that the real murder culprit was the gangster, and he assures Vivian that Carmen will get a doctor's help. Also starring Dorothy Malone as Acme Book Shop, Peggy Knudsen as Mona Mars, Regis Toomey as Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls and Charles D. Brown as Norris the Butler. I will absolutely honest and say that I hardly followed any real plot at all, it was pretty complicated, a review even says that it is complex for most people, for the witty script and the performances by real lovers and to-be husband and wife Bogie and Bacall it is a worthwhile classic detective drama. Good!

    The Big Sleep, directed by Howard Hawkins, persistently presents a perplexing but intricate plot line that is filled with sexual tension, speculation, and direct confrontation. The Shamus, Malone, encounters all these matters when he is introduced to the Sternwoods. Carmen, the youngest of daughter of General Sternwood, displays a multitude of sexually promiscuous behaviors. She finds Malone attractive and literally throws herself at him. In that moment Carmen seems raunchy. Her first impression on Malone can easily be abbreviated to less than desirable. Malone comments that the young lassie needs "weaning". The exchanges between Malone and Carmen signify that women need to be supervised because they cannot control themselves. The film also suggests women are cunning. The following decade, the fifties, film undergoes a drastic moral reformation. The depiction of women and their mannerisms in the fifties contradict the behaviors displayed by Carmen. Similarly, Carmen's older sister, Vivian, is forward. Vivian is decisive and sophisticated. She, unlike her hyper-sexual sister, is a tasteful and charming. Vivian and Carmen's interactions with Malone both prove the Sternwood girls are likable. Nevertheless, the affable sisters are jammed in several taboo social circles. Their mischief begins with black mailing and gradually the ladies are snared into relations with gamblers and killers. The unfavorable characters force their presence on the Sternwoods. Malone's hire and personal speculations lead him to solving the disconcerting investigation. Yet, the exploration ends with Vivian and Malone coupling. Even though the plot rifles off seven individuals, the romance manages to develop and transpire during the plot (grouping). It is typical for films to have a romantic aspect. The Big Sleep, no different, also has a romantic component. The spark of the relationship begins at the Sternwood estate. Vivian requests to see Malone and interrogates him. The desire Vivian has for Malone shows when she begins to regularly visit him at his office. The spontaneous run-ins also display the connection between the romantic pair. Through the midst of chaos, protecting a meaningful element in one's life is exposed throughout the big sleep. The spectrum begins with General Sternwood's desired protection of his daughters and extends to Malone's protection of Vivian as a romantic partner. There is also the protection of friends, sibling, and image. The desire to have security seems inevitable. Every person yearns for the proper safety. Some people, Malone and Vivian, find that safety in the love for a romantic partner.

    Unusually for me, this is a rare film where I have read the source novel before viewing the film - it's normally the other way around. Still, this classic film noir is pretty enjoyable in its own right even if the book's complex plot makes following things a touch tricky at times. But what really elevates this film, and what the studio knew at the time given their prominence in the publicity, is the electric chemistry between screen idols Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. It is a joy to watch and lifts what might have been a fairly plodding crime caper into the stuff of legend. Bogart is perfect as Philip Marlowe, a world-weary private detective summoned to the mansion of the aging General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) who asks Marlows for help when he finds himself being blackmailed. The General is convinced that it has something to do with one of his flighty daughters - the good-time-girl Carmen (Martha Vickers) or the femme fatale Vivian (Bacall). But as Marlowe digs a little deeper, it soon appears that everyone has something to hide. Marlowe's investigations turn over some unpleasant stones and as the case gets ever more complex, Marlowe can't help but feel that Vivian is the key... It may be suffering from some excessively dark scenes due to a lack of colourisation but "The Big Sleep" remains the classic film noir. Bogart simply IS Marlowe, wonderfully ragged at the edges and wears the expression of someone who has seen the worst the world has to offer. As a viewer with little exposure to Bogart's work (most of my movies involve at least one explosion), I had always assumed him to be a somewhat limited actor - but he is unmissable, especially when he and Bacall exchange dialogue that crackles with sexual tension and innuendo. The film is probably the closest to Raymond Chandler's vision and does the story justice, although I personally felt that some characters were underwritten and some dialogue felt difficult to understand. Maybe some of the technical advancements that have been made over the last seventy years could help iron out these particular issues but they rarely impede on the film as a whole and I can't score a movie lower just because it's old. But then again, that's part of its charm - there's no CG or big fight scenes to wow the audience but it doesn't need them. If anything, it feels more authentic than a modern version might. I still believe that instead of endless sequels or half-baked ideas like "Battleship", something like this could work as a remake - the era has been captured before in the likes of "LA Confidential" and "Road To Perdition" so why wouldn't it work? It's difficult to think how the magic between Bogie and Bacall could be replicated but that's why this movie is very much recommended - some things just can't be replicated.

    Spoilers near the end! My advice is to meet with this gently, have no thought what it's about, let the burden of names and trifle detail flow through you. Use it like you were calibrating the eye to focus. By itself the film is uninteresting and not really worth the energy required to investigate. On the page, I suppose the situation to have been somehow mitigated by Chandler's wit and prose but the plot is all of it disposable. If I kept on the right track, we have three sets of blackmail, six counts of murder, plus a seventh revealed near the end, and all sorts of trickery, fronts, and storymaking between players. But two sets of unconnected circumstances elevate this to something that is required viewing and working with. The Hays Code was one, a simple effect; none of Chandler's titillation about drugs and pornography could ever reach the big screen, so all the sex is staged between a camera concealed inside a statue and us getting to imagine about it. It works better than if it were explicit. The second one is even more incidental, a boozing Faulkner had shown up from Mississippi to write for the movies. Now I don't presume the finished script was either fully by design or by complete lack of it, since Faulkner didn't care beyond a paycheck, rather the result of handing out Chandler's hard and thin sense of reality to a literary giant of the most awesomely intuitive nature, capable for the most multilayered memory. Add to that reshoots of the film several months later, sexual innuendo between Bacall/Bogart spliced in, a key scene where Marlowe explains the plot left on the cutting room floor, and you already have enough pieces of the puzzle missing. Or what I call the Ambersons Effect, after the Welles film. This a situation where no writer is in full control of the complicated story originally intended, quite clearly in our case. The famous story is that Chandler had to be phoned back to shed some light on the cluster of murders. So we get a twist on Chandler's twist of the story, but following Marlowe's assembly of that story, the culprit is shot to pieces before we have a chance to corroborate. We leave the film thinking Marlowe got it right, had to. Here's where the world of allusive accidents kicks into effect. The framing device, this is where Carmen was going to be framed for murder, is a set of photos and a daze that makes her as a viewer susceptible to stories! Isn't this what happens to us each time we sit in the theater? Chandler controlled the device by using sex and drugs to explain, but that is gone. We just have the mystifying stupor, the girl drowsy in a Chinese dress. We have the concealed camera. We have Marlowe's coolly laid-out solution to the story, after the old blueprint of detective fiction - Holmes, Perry Mason, the mode that Chandler wrote in - so quite independent of the viewer. His snappy rat-ta-tat as he explains is followed moments later by the staccato sound of machine-gun fire. But upon reflection, the thing seems a bit off, ordinary logic broken in the process, this creates strangely ambiguous perturbations through a world we just experienced as rational and finite. Marlowe's story is near as possible as everyone else's, but the entire film leading up to it has been believable stories exposed as fabrication. The alternative reading I prefer, is that Marlowe solves blackmail but in doing so suspects he may have fallen for the wrong woman. So he investigates a second plot that is stories made-up by this woman to guard herself, in the end he unspools this in the only way where she turns out innocent and his instincts right all along. This is great the way we have it, a lesson in the relative dynamics of storytelling. When Marlowe resurfaces for The Long Goodbye, the world has outmaneuevered him in complexity. There is a boozing writer and shown to be destructive. The link is Leigh Brackett.

    All the girls/women in Howard Hawk's 1946 Classic 'The Big Sleep' either want to sit in his lap, remove their reading spectacles for or flirt with Humph in one way or another. Even if they don't actually like him, you can almost smell their respect for him. As we all know, the Raymond Chandler story is both complex and intriguing, but that's only half of it. You can stick this movie on umpteen times (as I do) and there's always bits that seem new and fresh, as well as the those that linger long and deep, like a fabulous fragrance. The story, for me is almost second fiddle, though it could easily be first, if I chose it to be. The period detail, the sharp banter and the suspenseful music, the shady characters, the lurking night-time shadows...I could go on. Howard Hawks did make some great films and this must rate as one of his very best. It's become famous for helping to cement Lauren Bacall's life-long relationship with Humph, probably the most loved and respected (and no doubt, envied) courtship in Hollywood history. The black & white photography is remarkably efficient and deceptively simple, yet has all the detail and complexities it needs. There's a real art in making a movie flow so easily and naturally. ALL those who even think of themselves as movie buffs, film-lovers or really anybody, who appreciates a fine film must see The Big Sleep at least once. It does come up on TCM occasionally and it's well worth the effort in tracking down the DVD. Comment Comment | Permalink

    Private detective Philip Marlowe is hired to deal with a case of blackmail but before the film is over he'll discover the case is really about more than that and the body count will rise quickly. Elderly General Sternwood is being blackmailed because of his wayward daughter Carmen's gambling. He mentioned that when this happened before his friend Sean Regan handled it but he has disappeared; apparently with the wife of a local casino owner and gangster. It isn't long before Marlowe finds the blackmailer but he is shot and killed before he can confront him. As the case deepens people try to warn him off but inevitably he doesn't back down even after taking a beating or two. While investigating the case Marlowe also finds himself getting closer the Carmen's older sister; Vivian even though at first they don't get on. This film is one of Bogart's best; he plays Marlowe in a way that makes the character seem slightly vulnerable despite his tough manner; he also has the lightness to deliver laugh out loud witty lines when required. Leading lady Lauren Bacall did a fine job as Vivian and Martha Vickers positively sizzled as Carmen her opening scene with Bogart was quite seductive! The plot kept moving at a fast pace; as soon as it looked like things might be about to resolved another twist would take the plot in another direction. Director Howard Hawks filmed the movie in a way that gave it a great atmosphere; it manages to be gritty and tense yet still have funny moments and a story that never really drags it may be nearly seventy years old now but it doesn't feel dated; I heartily recommend it.

    I think to analyze this movie, you have to separate the actors, the acting, and the script. I think many people are fooled into thinking this is a great film because it has the magic team -- Bogart and Bacall. Their mere presence, alone, does not a great movie make. As much as I like Bogie in his prime, and respected Bacall in hers, the magic that they made in "To Have And Have Not", "Dark Passage", and "Key Largo" just isn't that evident here. And, in terms of plot, this one rambles, and even the studio felt major improvements needed to be made to make the film appealing to post-war audiences. Now, that's not to say it's a bad film. It's a good film. But, just a "good" film. Not a "great" film". For example, in the house where the primary murder takes place...would Phillip Marlowe really leave his finger prints all over every key piece of evidence? Not if he was a good detective. Would everyone be continually going in and out of the murder house like it was a hotel lobby? I doubt it. Humphrey Bogart is good here...his character sure of himself...with some clever patter to go along with it. Lauren Bacall is good, but not sultry as she is in some other pairings with Bogart, and her character doesn't seem to know which side of her bread is buttered. Martha Vickers, as a foolish young lady, didn't impress. Regis Toomey as a police inspector once again proves he was a dependable character actor. Charles Waldron as the old man trying to protect his family was an interesting character. Louis Heydt has an interesting scene as a somewhat shady guy who isn't as clever as he thinks, and isn't tough enough, either. Elisha Cook is around for a while, but not in the tough role we saw in "The Maltese Falcon". I wish we would have seen more of Dorothy Malone here...very promising scenes that I understand were cut back because she was getting more attention than Lauren Bacall. Another problem with this film is that there are just too many characters to keep them all straight. Sort of like when you get halfway through a book and wish you'd started writing the characters down to keep them all straight. It's not that this is a bad movie. It's good...but not great. It's always interesting watching Humphrey Bogart. A marvelous actor. I recommend watching this movie, but I think the 8 point + rating on IMDb is too high.

    In Los Angeles, the private investigator Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is invited by the wealthy General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) to a meeting at his house. General Sternwood, who lives with his pretty and wild daughters Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall) and Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers), explains that he has been blackmailed by the bookseller Arthur Geiger on Carmen debts in gambling. The general also tells that he had been blackmailed in the past by the scum Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), but his Irish friend and shamus Sean Reagan resolved the situation. Then Sean decided to leave L. A. with Mona Mars (Peggy Knudsen), the wife of casino owner Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), but now Sean has gone missing. Vivian meets Marlowe when he is leaving the house and tells that she had borrowed money from Eddie Mars to pay for photos of Carmen. Marlowe follows Geiger from his bookstore home and when he hears Carmen screaming, he discovers that Geiger is dead, Carmen is doped and also a hidden camera missing the film with photos of Carmen. Marlowe brings Carmen home and when he returns, Geiger's body is vanished. Then Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls (Regis Toomey) invites his friend Marlowe to go with him to see a body of the general's driver in a Packard that has been withdrawn from the pier.

    Unusually for me, this is a rare film where I have read the source novel before viewing the film - it's normally the other way around. Still, this classic film noir is pretty enjoyable in its own right even if the book's complex plot makes following things a touch tricky at times. But what really elevates this film, and what the studio knew at the time given their prominence in the publicity, is the electric chemistry between screen idols Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. It is a joy to watch and lifts what might have been a fairly plodding crime caper into the stuff of legend. Bogart is perfect as Philip Marlowe, a world-weary private detective summoned to the mansion of the aging General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) who asks Marlows for help when he finds himself being blackmailed. The General is convinced that it has something to do with one of his flighty daughters - the good-time-girl Carmen (Martha Vickers) or the femme fatale Vivian (Bacall). But as Marlowe digs a little deeper, it soon appears that everyone has something to hide. Marlowe's investigations turn over some unpleasant stones and as the case gets ever more complex, Marlowe can't help but feel that Vivian is the key... It may be suffering from some excessively dark scenes due to a lack of colourisation but "The Big Sleep" remains the classic film noir. Bogart simply IS Marlowe, wonderfully ragged at the edges and wears the expression of someone who has seen the worst the world has to offer. As a viewer with little exposure to Bogart's work (most of my movies involve at least one explosion), I had always assumed him to be a somewhat limited actor - but he is unmissable, especially when he and Bacall exchange dialogue that crackles with sexual tension and innuendo. The film is probably the closest to Raymond Chandler's vision and does the story justice, although I personally felt that some characters were underwritten and some dialogue felt difficult to understand. Maybe some of the technical advancements that have been made over the last seventy years could help iron out these particular issues but they rarely impede on the film as a whole and I can't score a movie lower just because it's old. But then again, that's part of its charm - there's no CG or big fight scenes to wow the audience but it doesn't need them. If anything, it feels more authentic than a modern version might. I still believe that instead of endless sequels or half-baked ideas like "Battleship", something like this could work as a remake - the era has been captured before in the likes of "LA Confidential" and "Road To Perdition" so why wouldn't it work? It's difficult to think how the magic between Bogie and Bacall could be replicated but that's why this movie is very much recommended - some things just can't be replicated.

    Spoilers near the end! My advice is to meet with this gently, have no thought what it's about, let the burden of names and trifle detail flow through you. Use it like you were calibrating the eye to focus. By itself the film is uninteresting and not really worth the energy required to investigate. On the page, I suppose the situation to have been somehow mitigated by Chandler's wit and prose but the plot is all of it disposable. If I kept on the right track, we have three sets of blackmail, six counts of murder, plus a seventh revealed near the end, and all sorts of trickery, fronts, and storymaking between players. But two sets of unconnected circumstances elevate this to something that is required viewing and working with. The Hays Code was one, a simple effect; none of Chandler's titillation about drugs and pornography could ever reach the big screen, so all the sex is staged between a camera concealed inside a statue and us getting to imagine about it. It works better than if it were explicit. The second one is even more incidental, a boozing Faulkner had shown up from Mississippi to write for the movies. Now I don't presume the finished script was either fully by design or by complete lack of it, since Faulkner didn't care beyond a paycheck, rather the result of handing out Chandler's hard and thin sense of reality to a literary giant of the most awesomely intuitive nature, capable for the most multilayered memory. Add to that reshoots of the film several months later, sexual innuendo between Bacall/Bogart spliced in, a key scene where Marlowe explains the plot left on the cutting room floor, and you already have enough pieces of the puzzle missing. Or what I call the Ambersons Effect, after the Welles film. This a situation where no writer is in full control of the complicated story originally intended, quite clearly in our case. The famous story is that Chandler had to be phoned back to shed some light on the cluster of murders. So we get a twist on Chandler's twist of the story, but following Marlowe's assembly of that story, the culprit is shot to pieces before we have a chance to corroborate. We leave the film thinking Marlowe got it right, had to. Here's where the world of allusive accidents kicks into effect. The framing device, this is where Carmen was going to be framed for murder, is a set of photos and a daze that makes her as a viewer susceptible to stories! Isn't this what happens to us each time we sit in the theater? Chandler controlled the device by using sex and drugs to explain, but that is gone. We just have the mystifying stupor, the girl drowsy in a Chinese dress. We have the concealed camera. We have Marlowe's coolly laid-out solution to the story, after the old blueprint of detective fiction - Holmes, Perry Mason, the mode that Chandler wrote in - so quite independent of the viewer. His snappy rat-ta-tat as he explains is followed moments later by the staccato sound of machine-gun fire. But upon reflection, the thing seems a bit off, ordinary logic broken in the process, this creates strangely ambiguous perturbations through a world we just experienced as rational and finite. Marlowe's story is near as possible as everyone else's, but the entire film leading up to it has been believable stories exposed as fabrication. The alternative reading I prefer, is that Marlowe solves blackmail but in doing so suspects he may have fallen for the wrong woman. So he investigates a second plot that is stories made-up by this woman to guard herself, in the end he unspools this in the only way where she turns out innocent and his instincts right all along. This is great the way we have it, a lesson in the relative dynamics of storytelling. When Marlowe resurfaces for The Long Goodbye, the world has outmaneuevered him in complexity. There is a boozing writer and shown to be destructive. The link is Leigh Brackett.

    All the girls/women in Howard Hawk's 1946 Classic 'The Big Sleep' either want to sit in his lap, remove their reading spectacles for or flirt with Humph in one way or another. Even if they don't actually like him, you can almost smell their respect for him. As we all know, the Raymond Chandler story is both complex and intriguing, but that's only half of it. You can stick this movie on umpteen times (as I do) and there's always bits that seem new and fresh, as well as the those that linger long and deep, like a fabulous fragrance. The story, for me is almost second fiddle, though it could easily be first, if I chose it to be. The period detail, the sharp banter and the suspenseful music, the shady characters, the lurking night-time shadows...I could go on. Howard Hawks did make some great films and this must rate as one of his very best. It's become famous for helping to cement Lauren Bacall's life-long relationship with Humph, probably the most loved and respected (and no doubt, envied) courtship in Hollywood history. The black & white photography is remarkably efficient and deceptively simple, yet has all the detail and complexities it needs. There's a real art in making a movie flow so easily and naturally. ALL those who even think of themselves as movie buffs, film-lovers or really anybody, who appreciates a fine film must see The Big Sleep at least once. It does come up on TCM occasionally and it's well worth the effort in tracking down the DVD. Comment Comment | Permalink

    Private detective Philip Marlowe is hired to deal with a case of blackmail but before the film is over he'll discover the case is really about more than that and the body count will rise quickly. Elderly General Sternwood is being blackmailed because of his wayward daughter Carmen's gambling. He mentioned that when this happened before his friend Sean Regan handled it but he has disappeared; apparently with the wife of a local casino owner and gangster. It isn't long before Marlowe finds the blackmailer but he is shot and killed before he can confront him. As the case deepens people try to warn him off but inevitably he doesn't back down even after taking a beating or two. While investigating the case Marlowe also finds himself getting closer the Carmen's older sister; Vivian even though at first they don't get on. This film is one of Bogart's best; he plays Marlowe in a way that makes the character seem slightly vulnerable despite his tough manner; he also has the lightness to deliver laugh out loud witty lines when required. Leading lady Lauren Bacall did a fine job as Vivian and Martha Vickers positively sizzled as Carmen her opening scene with Bogart was quite seductive! The plot kept moving at a fast pace; as soon as it looked like things might be about to resolved another twist would take the plot in another direction. Director Howard Hawks filmed the movie in a way that gave it a great atmosphere; it manages to be gritty and tense yet still have funny moments and a story that never really drags it may be nearly seventy years old now but it doesn't feel dated; I heartily recommend it.

    I think to analyze this movie, you have to separate the actors, the acting, and the script. I think many people are fooled into thinking this is a great film because it has the magic team -- Bogart and Bacall. Their mere presence, alone, does not a great movie make. As much as I like Bogie in his prime, and respected Bacall in hers, the magic that they made in "To Have And Have Not", "Dark Passage", and "Key Largo" just isn't that evident here. And, in terms of plot, this one rambles, and even the studio felt major improvements needed to be made to make the film appealing to post-war audiences. Now, that's not to say it's a bad film. It's a good film. But, just a "good" film. Not a "great" film". For example, in the house where the primary murder takes place...would Phillip Marlowe really leave his finger prints all over every key piece of evidence? Not if he was a good detective. Would everyone be continually going in and out of the murder house like it was a hotel lobby? I doubt it. Humphrey Bogart is good here...his character sure of himself...with some clever patter to go along with it. Lauren Bacall is good, but not sultry as she is in some other pairings with Bogart, and her character doesn't seem to know which side of her bread is buttered. Martha Vickers, as a foolish young lady, didn't impress. Regis Toomey as a police inspector once again proves he was a dependable character actor. Charles Waldron as the old man trying to protect his family was an interesting character. Louis Heydt has an interesting scene as a somewhat shady guy who isn't as clever as he thinks, and isn't tough enough, either. Elisha Cook is around for a while, but not in the tough role we saw in "The Maltese Falcon". I wish we would have seen more of Dorothy Malone here...very promising scenes that I understand were cut back because she was getting more attention than Lauren Bacall. Another problem with this film is that there are just too many characters to keep them all straight. Sort of like when you get halfway through a book and wish you'd started writing the characters down to keep them all straight. It's not that this is a bad movie. It's good...but not great. It's always interesting watching Humphrey Bogart. A marvelous actor. I recommend watching this movie, but I think the 8 point + rating on IMDb is too high.

    In Los Angeles, the private investigator Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is invited by the wealthy General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) to a meeting at his house. General Sternwood, who lives with his pretty and wild daughters Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall) and Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers), explains that he has been blackmailed by the bookseller Arthur Geiger on Carmen debts in gambling. The general also tells that he had been blackmailed in the past by the scum Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), but his Irish friend and shamus Sean Reagan resolved the situation. Then Sean decided to leave L. A. with Mona Mars (Peggy Knudsen), the wife of casino owner Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), but now Sean has gone missing. Vivian meets Marlowe when he is leaving the house and tells that she had borrowed money from Eddie Mars to pay for photos of Carmen. Marlowe follows Geiger from his bookstore home and when he hears Carmen screaming, he discovers that Geiger is dead, Carmen is doped and also a hidden camera missing the film with photos of Carmen. Marlowe brings Carmen home and when he returns, Geiger's body is vanished. Then Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls (Regis Toomey) invites his friend Marlowe to go with him to see a body of the general's driver in a Packard that has been withdrawn from the pier. Marlowe connects the dots and is evolved by a complex network of blackmails and deaths while Vivian and he fall in love with each other. "The Big Sleep" is a splendid film-noir, actually one of the best I have ever seen, directed by Howard Hawks with a magnificent story of blackmail and deaths and stunning performances. Lauren Bacall is the perfect femme fatale and Humphrey Bogart, my favorite actor ever, has another top-notch performance. The plot has many details and sleazy characters and I intend to see this movie again in a near future to "catch" details that might have gone missing. Last but not the least, I found the explanation of the title in Google that means "death" and is explained in the novel. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "&Agrave; Beira do Abismo" ("On the Edge of the Abyss")

    And it's here, with "The Big Sleep" that Humphrey Bogart puts his signature stamp on Raymond Chandler's greatest character, Philip Marlowe. "The Big Sleep" is a film that, despite its overly complicated plot remains very watchable because of the players and scenes that make up its whole. Bogart is a marvel in this movie, and his scenes with Lauren Bacall's femme fatale are electric. The dialogue is candy to the ears with a plethora of killer one-liners. You feel like your head is spinning when THE END rolls, but it was such a well-written ride, you just don't care. This is a terrific film in arguably Hollywood's greatest period, and Bogey just plays the hell out of the role. Speaking of Bogart, he's a total babe magnet in this movie. The first half is a series of gorgeous women that just come and go with bit parts. It's crazy how Bond-like he becomes. 8.5/10

    The definitive Humphrey Bogart/Lauren Bacall vehicle, The Big Sleep casts Bogart as Raymond Chandler's cynical private eye Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as the female lead in a film about the "process of a criminal investigation, not its results".This is the first film version of Raymond Chandler's novel of the same title. William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman co-wrote the screenplay; and it was directed by Howard Hawks. Summoned to the home of the fabulously wealthy General Sternwood, Marlowe is hired to deal with a blackmailer shaking down the General's sensuous, thumb-sucking daughter Carmen. This earns Marlowe the displeasure of Carmen's sloe-eyed, seemingly straight-laced older sister Vivian, who is fiercely protective of her somewhat addled sibling. As he pursues the case at hand, Marlowe gets mixed up in the murder of Arthur Geiger, a dealer in pornography. He also runs afoul of gambling-house proprietor Eddie Mars, who seems to have some sort of hold over the enigmatic Vivian. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall made screen history together more than once, but they were never more popular than in this film that is witty and sinister, and in an odd way is a realistic portrayal of big-city life with Arabian Nights overtones.The characters have been transferred to the screen with punch by Howard Hawks' production and direction, providing full load of rough, tense action most of the way.This is one movie that every film student should study and every movie lover should watch at least once.A true classic Bogie and Bacall film indeed.

    Featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I recognised this film because of the easy to remember title and the leading actor and leading actress, I was hoping it would be a film worthy for recommendation, from director Howard Hawks (Scarface, Bringing Up Baby, To Have and Have Not, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Monkey Business). Basically dying General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) in Los Angeles hires private-eye detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) to supposedly keep an eye on his daughter Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) who owes many gambling debts to bookseller Arthur Gwynn Geiger (Theodore Von Eltz), but it may in fact be his older daughter Vivian (Lauren Bacall) that needs his help. Marlowe goes to find the bookseller, the shop being looked after by assistant Agnes Louzier (Sonia Darrin), and when he tries to talk to Geiger he finds his body instead, along with a drugged Carmen, and later when he returns the body disappears, and the Sternwood driver is found dead too. Vivian comes to see Marlowe with some blackmail type pictures of Carmen, so he goes back to the bookseller's shop and follows a car to the apartment Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), a gambler who has blackmailed the General, and after returning to talk to Carmen she at first denies any knowledge of the Geiger's murder, but then names Brody as the killer. After an encounter with small-time gangster Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), Marlowe, Vivian and Carmen go to see Brody, with Agnes there too, to get the photos back, but an assailant shoots Brody dead, but the shooter, Geiger's former driver Carol Lundgren (Tommy Rafferty) who killed for revenge. Marlowe needs answers from Mars, and after some stooge work and pressing there is some kind of robbery plot revealed, and Carmen reveals that Mars calls Vivian frequently, and then she tries to seduce him but he refuses to give in to it. There is some kind of murder plot by Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), hired killer Lash Canino (Bob Steele) is sent to kill Agnes or whatever but Marlowe kills him first, and after some more gossip and revelations a meeting is arranged with Mars at Geiger's place. Guns are pulled out as Mars reveals he blackmailed Vivian to claim a crime of murder, in the chase Mars ends up shot accidentally by his own men, Marlowe calls the police and says that the real murder culprit was the gangster, and he assures Vivian that Carmen will get a doctor's help. Also starring Dorothy Malone as Acme Book Shop, Peggy Knudsen as Mona Mars, Regis Toomey as Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls and Charles D. Brown as Norris the Butler. I will absolutely honest and say that I hardly followed any real plot at all, it was pretty complicated, a review even says that it is complex for most people, for the witty script and the performances by real lovers and to-be husband and wife Bogie and Bacall it is a worthwhile classic detective drama. Good!

    The Big Sleep, directed by Howard Hawkins, persistently presents a perplexing but intricate plot line that is filled with sexual tension, speculation, and direct confrontation. The Shamus, Malone, encounters all these matters when he is introduced to the Sternwoods. Carmen, the youngest of daughter of General Sternwood, displays a multitude of sexually promiscuous behaviors. She finds Malone attractive and literally throws herself at him. In that moment Carmen seems raunchy. Her first impression on Malone can easily be abbreviated to less than desirable. Malone comments that the young lassie needs "weaning". The exchanges between Malone and Carmen signify that women need to be supervised because they cannot control themselves. The film also suggests women are cunning. The following decade, the fifties, film undergoes a drastic moral reformation. The depiction of women and their mannerisms in the fifties contradict the behaviors displayed by Carmen. Similarly, Carmen's older sister, Vivian, is forward. Vivian is decisive and sophisticated. She, unlike her hyper-sexual sister, is a tasteful and charming. Vivian and Carmen's interactions with Malone both prove the Sternwood girls are likable. Nevertheless, the affable sisters are jammed in several taboo social circles. Their mischief begins with black mailing and gradually the ladies are snared into relations with gamblers and killers. The unfavorable characters force their presence on the Sternwoods. Malone's hire and personal speculations lead him to solving the disconcerting investigation. Yet, the exploration ends with Vivian and Malone coupling.

There is also the protection of friends, sibling, and image. The desire to have security seems inevitable. Every person yearns for the proper safety.

So he investigates a second plot that is stories made-up by this woman to guard herself, in the end he unspools this in the only way where she turns out innocent and his instincts right all along. This is great the way we have it, a lesson in the relative dynamics of storytelling. When Marlowe resurfaces for The Long Goodbye, the world has outmaneuevered him in complexity. There is a boozing writer and shown to be destructive. The link is Leigh Brackett.

    All the girls/women in Howard Hawk's 1946 Classic 'The Big Sleep' either want to sit in his lap, remove their reading spectacles for or flirt with Humph in one way or another. Even if they don't actually like him, you can almost smell their respect for him. As we all know, the Raymond Chandler story is both complex and intriguing, but that's only half of it. You can stick this movie on umpteen times (as I do) and there's always bits that seem new and fresh, as well as the those that linger long and deep, like a fabulous fragrance. The story, for me is almost second fiddle, though it could easily be first, if I chose it to be. The period detail, the sharp banter and the suspenseful music, the shady characters, the lurking night-time shadows...I could go on. Howard Hawks did make some great films and this must rate as one of his very best. It's become famous for helping to cement Lauren Bacall's life-long relationship with Humph, probably the most loved and respected (and no doubt, envied) courtship in Hollywood history. The black & white photography is remarkably efficient and deceptively simple, yet has all the detail and complexities it needs. There's a real art in making a movie flow so easily and naturally. ALL those who even think of themselves as movie buffs, film-lovers or really anybody, who appreciates a fine film must see The Big Sleep at least once. It does come up on TCM occasionally and it's well worth the effort in tracking down the DVD. Comment Comment | Permalink

    Private detective Philip Marlowe is hired to deal with a case of blackmail but before the film is over he'll discover the case is really about more than that and the body count will rise quickly. Elderly General Sternwood is being blackmailed because of his wayward daughter Carmen's gambling. He mentioned that when this happened before his friend Sean Regan handled it but he has disappeared; apparently with the wife of a local casino owner and gangster. It isn't long before Marlowe finds the blackmailer but he is shot and killed before he can confront him. As the case deepens people try to warn him off but inevitably he doesn't back down even after taking a beating or two. While investigating the case Marlowe also finds himself getting closer the Carmen's older sister; Vivian even though at first they don't get on. This film is one of Bogart's best; he plays Marlowe in a way that makes the character seem slightly vulnerable despite his tough manner; he also has the lightness to deliver laugh out loud witty lines when required. Leading lady Lauren Bacall did a fine job as Vivian and Martha Vickers positively sizzled as Carmen her opening scene with Bogart was quite seductive! The plot kept moving at a fast pace; as soon as it looked like things might be about to resolved another twist would take the plot in another direction. Director Howard Hawks filmed the movie in a way that gave it a great atmosphere; it manages to be gritty and tense yet still have funny moments and a story that never really drags it may be nearly seventy years old now but it doesn't feel dated; I heartily recommend it.

    I think to analyze this movie, you have to separate the actors, the acting, and the script. I think many people are fooled into thinking this is a great film because it has the magic team -- Bogart and Bacall. Their mere presence, alone, does not a great movie make. As much as I like Bogie in his prime, and respected Bacall in hers, the magic that they made in "To Have And Have Not", "Dark Passage", and "Key Largo" just isn't that evident here. And, in terms of plot, this one rambles, and even the studio felt major improvements needed to be made to make the film appealing to post-war audiences. Now, that's not to say it's a bad film. It's a good film. But, just a "good" film. Not a "great" film". For example, in the house where the primary murder takes place...would Phillip Marlowe really leave his finger prints all over every key piece of evidence? Not if he was a good detective. Would everyone be continually going in and out of the murder house like it was a hotel lobby? I doubt it. Humphrey Bogart is good here...his character sure of himself...with some clever patter to go along with it. Lauren Bacall is good, but not sultry as she is in some other pairings with Bogart, and her character doesn't seem to know which side of her bread is buttered. Martha Vickers, as a foolish young lady, didn't impress. Regis Toomey as a police inspector once again proves he was a dependable character actor. Charles Waldron as the old man trying to protect his family was an interesting character. Louis Heydt has an interesting scene as a somewhat shady guy who isn't as clever as he thinks, and isn't tough enough, either. Elisha Cook is around for a while, but not in the tough role we saw in "The Maltese Falcon". I wish we would have seen more of Dorothy Malone here...very promising scenes that I understand were cut back because she was getting more attention than Lauren Bacall. Another problem with this film is that there are just too many characters to keep them all straight. Sort of like when you get halfway through a book and wish you'd started writing the characters down to keep them all straight. It's not that this is a bad movie. It's good...but not great. It's always interesting watching Humphrey Bogart. A marvelous actor. I recommend watching this movie, but I think the 8 point + rating on IMDb is too high.

    In Los Angeles, the private investigator Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) is invited by the wealthy General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) to a meeting at his house. General Sternwood, who lives with his pretty and wild daughters Vivian Rutledge (Lauren Bacall) and Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers), explains that he has been blackmailed by the bookseller Arthur Geiger on Carmen debts in gambling. The general also tells that he had been blackmailed in the past by the scum Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), but his Irish friend and shamus Sean Reagan resolved the situation. Then Sean decided to leave L. A. with Mona Mars (Peggy Knudsen), the wife of casino owner Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), but now Sean has gone missing. Vivian meets Marlowe when he is leaving the house and tells that she had borrowed money from Eddie Mars to pay for photos of Carmen. Marlowe follows Geiger from his bookstore home and when he hears Carmen screaming, he discovers that Geiger is dead, Carmen is doped and also a hidden camera missing the film with photos of Carmen. Marlowe brings Carmen home and when he returns, Geiger's body is vanished. Then Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls (Regis Toomey) invites his friend Marlowe to go with him to see a body of the general's driver in a Packard that has been withdrawn from the pier. Marlowe connects the dots and is evolved by a complex network of blackmails and deaths while Vivian and he fall in love with each other. "The Big Sleep" is a splendid film-noir, actually one of the best I have ever seen, directed by Howard Hawks with a magnificent story of blackmail and deaths and stunning performances. Lauren Bacall is the perfect femme fatale and Humphrey Bogart, my favorite actor ever, has another top-notch performance. The plot has many details and sleazy characters and I intend to see this movie again in a near future to "catch" details that might have gone missing. Last but not the least, I found the explanation of the title in Google that means "death" and is explained in the novel. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "&Agrave; Beira do Abismo" ("On the Edge of the Abyss")

    And it's here, with "The Big Sleep" that Humphrey Bogart puts his signature stamp on Raymond Chandler's greatest character, Philip Marlowe. "The Big Sleep" is a film that, despite its overly complicated plot remains very watchable because of the players and scenes that make up its whole. Bogart is a marvel in this movie, and his scenes with Lauren Bacall's femme fatale are electric. The dialogue is candy to the ears with a plethora of killer one-liners. You feel like your head is spinning when THE END rolls, but it was such a well-written ride, you just don't care. This is a terrific film in arguably Hollywood's greatest period, and Bogey just plays the hell out of the role. Speaking of Bogart, he's a total babe magnet in this movie. The first half is a series of gorgeous women that just come and go with bit parts. It's crazy how Bond-like he becomes. 8.5/10

    The definitive Humphrey Bogart/Lauren Bacall vehicle, The Big Sleep casts Bogart as Raymond Chandler's cynical private eye Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as the female lead in a film about the "process of a criminal investigation, not its results".This is the first film version of Raymond Chandler's novel of the same title. William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman co-wrote the screenplay; and it was directed by Howard Hawks. Summoned to the home of the fabulously wealthy General Sternwood, Marlowe is hired to deal with a blackmailer shaking down the General's sensuous, thumb-sucking daughter Carmen. This earns Marlowe the displeasure of Carmen's sloe-eyed, seemingly straight-laced older sister Vivian, who is fiercely protective of her somewhat addled sibling. As he pursues the case at hand, Marlowe gets mixed up in the murder of Arthur Geiger, a dealer in pornography. He also runs afoul of gambling-house proprietor Eddie Mars, who seems to have some sort of hold over the enigmatic Vivian. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall made screen history together more than once, but they were never more popular than in this film that is witty and sinister, and in an odd way is a realistic portrayal of big-city life with Arabian Nights overtones.The characters have been transferred to the screen with punch by Howard Hawks' production and direction, providing full load of rough, tense action most of the way.This is one movie that every film student should study and every movie lover should watch at least once.A true classic Bogie and Bacall film indeed.

    Featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I recognised this film because of the easy to remember title and the leading actor and leading actress, I was hoping it would be a film worthy for recommendation, from director Howard Hawks (Scarface, Bringing Up Baby, To Have and Have Not, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Monkey Business). Basically dying General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) in Los Angeles hires private-eye detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) to supposedly keep an eye on his daughter Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) who owes many gambling debts to bookseller Arthur Gwynn Geiger (Theodore Von Eltz), but it may in fact be his older daughter Vivian (Lauren Bacall) that needs his help. Marlowe goes to find the bookseller, the shop being looked after by assistant Agnes Louzier (Sonia Darrin), and when he tries to talk to Geiger he finds his body instead, along with a drugged Carmen, and later when he returns the body disappears, and the Sternwood driver is found dead too. Vivian comes to see Marlowe with some blackmail type pictures of Carmen, so he goes back to the bookseller's shop and follows a car to the apartment Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), a gambler who has blackmailed the General, and after returning to talk to Carmen she at first denies any knowledge of the Geiger's murder, but then names Brody as the killer. After an encounter with small-time gangster Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), Marlowe, Vivian and Carmen go to see Brody, with Agnes there too, to get the photos back, but an assailant shoots Brody dead, but the shooter, Geiger's former driver Carol Lundgren (Tommy Rafferty) who killed for revenge. Marlowe needs answers from Mars, and after some stooge work and pressing there is some kind of robbery plot revealed, and Carmen reveals that Mars calls Vivian frequently, and then she tries to seduce him but he refuses to give in to it. There is some kind of murder plot by Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), hired killer Lash Canino (Bob Steele) is sent to kill Agnes or whatever but Marlowe kills him first, and after some more gossip and revelations a meeting is arranged with Mars at Geiger's place. Guns are pulled out as Mars reveals he blackmailed Vivian to claim a crime of murder, in the chase Mars ends up shot accidentally by his own men, Marlowe calls the police and says that the real murder culprit was the gangster, and he assures Vivian that Carmen will get a doctor's help. Also starring Dorothy Malone as Acme Book Shop, Peggy Knudsen as Mona Mars, Regis Toomey as Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls and Charles D. Brown as Norris the Butler. I will absolutely honest and say that I hardly followed any real plot at all, it was pretty complicated, a review even says that it is complex for most people, for the witty script and the performances by real lovers and to-be husband and wife Bogie and Bacall it is a worthwhile classic detective drama. Good!

    The Big Sleep, directed by Howard Hawkins, persistently presents a perplexing but intricate plot line that is filled with sexual tension, speculation, and direct confrontation. The Shamus, Malone, encounters all these matters when he is introduced to the Sternwoods. Carmen, the youngest of daughter of General Sternwood, displays a multitude of sexually promiscuous behaviors. She finds Malone attractive and literally throws herself at him. In that moment Carmen seems raunchy. Her first impression on Malone can easily be abbreviated to less than desirable. Malone comments that the young lassie needs "weaning". The exchanges between Malone and Carmen signify that women need to be supervised because they cannot control themselves. The film also suggests women are cunning. The following decade, the fifties, film undergoes a drastic moral reformation. The depiction of women and their mannerisms in the fifties contradict the behaviors displayed by Carmen. Similarly, Carmen's older sister, Vivian, is forward. Vivian is decisive and sophisticated. She, unlike her hyper-sexual sister, is a tasteful and charming. Vivian and Carmen's interactions with Malone both prove the Sternwood girls are likable. Nevertheless, the affable sisters are jammed in several taboo social circles. Their mischief begins with black mailing and gradually the ladies are snared into relations with gamblers and killers. The unfavorable characters force their presence on the Sternwoods. Malone's hire and personal speculations lead him to solving the disconcerting investigation. Yet, the exploration ends with Vivian and Malone coupling. Even though the plot rifles off seven individuals, the romance manages to develop and transpire during the plot (grouping). It is typical for films to have a romantic aspect. The Big Sleep, no different, also has a romantic component. The spark of the relationship begins at the Sternwood estate. Vivian requests to see Malone and interrogates him. The desire Vivian has for Malone shows when she begins to regularly visit him at his office. The spontaneous run-ins also display the connection between the romantic pair. Through the midst of chaos, protecting a meaningful element in one's life is exposed throughout the big sleep. The spectrum begins with General Sternwood's desired protection of his daughters and extends to Malone's protection of Vivian as a romantic partner. There is also the protection of friends, sibling, and image. The desire to have security seems inevitable. Every person yearns for the proper safety. Some people, Malone and Vivian, find that safety in the love for a romantic partner.

    Unusually for me, this is a rare film where I have read the source novel before viewing the film - it's normally the other way around. Still, this classic film noir is pretty enjoyable in its own right even if the book's complex plot makes following things a touch tricky at times. But what really elevates this film, and what the studio knew at the time given their prominence in the publicity, is the electric chemistry between screen idols Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. It is a joy to watch and lifts what might have been a fairly plodding crime caper into the stuff of legend. Bogart is perfect as Philip Marlowe, a world-weary private detective summoned to the mansion of the aging General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) who asks Marlows for help when he finds himself being blackmailed. The General is convinced that it has something to do with one of his flighty daughters - the good-time-girl Carmen (Martha Vickers) or the femme fatale Vivian (Bacall). But as Marlowe digs a little deeper, it soon appears that everyone has something to hide. Marlowe's investigations turn over some unpleasant stones and as the case gets ever more complex, Marlowe can't help but feel that Vivian is the key... It may be suffering from some excessively dark scenes due to a lack of colourisation but "The Big Sleep" remains the classic film noir. Bogart simply IS Marlowe, wonderfully ragged at the edges and wears the expression of someone who has seen the worst the world has to offer. As a viewer with little exposure to Bogart's work (most of my movies involve at least one explosion), I had always assumed him to be a somewhat limited actor - but he is unmissable, especially when he and Bacall exchange dialogue that crackles with sexual tension and innuendo. The film is probably the closest to Raymond Chandler's vision and does the story justice, although I personally felt that some characters were underwritten and some dialogue felt difficult to understand. Maybe some of the technical advancements that have been made over the last seventy years could help iron out these particular issues but they rarely impede on the film as a whole and I can't score a movie lower just because it's old. But then again, that's part of its charm - there's no CG or big fight scenes to wow the audience but it doesn't need them. If anything, it feels more authentic than a modern version might. I still believe that instead of endless sequels or half-baked ideas like "Battleship", something like this could work as a remake - the era has been captured before in the likes of "LA Confidential" and "Road To Perdition" so why wouldn't it work? It's difficult to think how the magic between Bogie and Bacall could be replicated but that's why this movie is very much recommended - some things just can't be replicated.

    Spoilers near the end! My advice is to meet with this gently, have no thought what it's about, let the burden of names and trifle detail flow through you. Use it like you were calibrating the eye to focus. By itself the film is uninteresting and not really worth the energy required to investigate. On the page, I suppose the situation to have been somehow mitigated by Chandler's wit and prose but the plot is all of it disposable. If I kept on the right track, we have three sets of blackmail, six counts of murder, plus a seventh revealed near the end, and all sorts of trickery, fronts, and storymaking between players. But two sets of unconnected circumstances elevate this to something that is required viewing and working with. The Hays Code was one, a simple effect; none of Chandler's titillation about drugs and pornography could ever reach the big screen, so all the sex is staged between a camera concealed inside a statue and us getting to imagine about it. It works better than if it were explicit. The second one is even more incidental, a boozing Faulkner had shown up from Mississippi to write for the movies. Now I don't presume the finished script was either fully by design or by complete lack of it, since Faulkner didn't care beyond a paycheck, rather the result of handing out Chandler's hard and thin sense of reality to a literary giant of the most awesomely intuitive nature, capable for the most multilayered memory. Add to that reshoots of the film several months later, sexual innuendo between Bacall/Bogart spliced in, a key scene where Marlowe explains the plot left on the cutting room floor, and you already have enough pieces of the puzzle missing. Or what I call the Ambersons Effect, after the Welles film. This a situation where no writer is in full control of the complicated story originally intended, quite clearly in our case. The famous story is that Chandler had to be phoned back to shed some light on the cluster of murders. So we get a twist on Chandler's twist of the story, but following Marlowe's assembly of that story, the culprit is shot to pieces before we have a chance to corroborate. We leave the film thinking Marlowe got it right, had to. Here's where the world of allusive accidents kicks into effect. The framing device, this is where Carmen was going to be framed for murder, is a set of photos and a daze that makes her as a viewer susceptible to stories! Isn't this what happens to us each time we sit in the theater? Chandler controlled the device by using sex and drugs to explain, but that is gone. We just have the mystifying stupor, the girl drowsy in a Chinese dress. We have the concealed camera. We have Marlowe's coolly laid-out solution to the story, after the old blueprint of detective fiction - Holmes, Perry Mason, the mode that Chandler wrote in - so quite independent of the viewer. His snappy rat-ta-tat as he explains is followed moments later by the staccato sound of machine-gun fire. But upon reflection, the thing seems a bit off, ordinary logic broken in the process, this creates strangely ambiguous perturbations through a world we just experienced as rational and finite. Marlowe's story is near as possible as everyone else's, but the entire film leading up to it has been believable stories exposed as fabrication. The alternative reading I prefer, is that Marlowe solves blackmail but in doing so suspects he may have fallen for the wrong woman. So he investigates a second plot that is stories made-up by this woman to guard herself, in the end he unspools this in the only way where she turns out innocent and his instincts right all along. This is great the way we have it, a lesson in the relative dynamics of storytelling. When Marlowe resurfaces for The Long Goodbye, the world has outmaneuevered him in complexity. There is a boozing writer and shown to be destructive. The link is Leigh Brackett.

Marlowe follows Geiger from his bookstore home and when he hears Carmen screaming, he discovers that Geiger is dead, Carmen is doped and also a hidden camera missing the film with photos of Carmen. Marlowe brings Carmen home and when he returns, Geiger's body is vanished. Then Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls (Regis Toomey) invites his friend Marlowe to go with him to see a body of the general's driver in a Packard that has been withdrawn from the pier. Marlowe connects the dots and is evolved by a complex network of blackmails and deaths while Vivian and he fall in love with each other. "The Big Sleep" is a splendid film-noir, actually one of the best I have ever seen, directed by Howard Hawks with a magnificent story of blackmail and deaths and stunning performances. Lauren Bacall is the perfect femme fatale and Humphrey Bogart, my favorite actor ever, has another top-notch performance. The plot has many details and sleazy characters and I intend to see this movie again in a near future to "catch" details that might have gone missing. Last but not the least, I found the explanation of the title in Google that means "death" and is explained in the novel. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): "&Agrave; Beira do Abismo" ("On the Edge of the Abyss")

    And it's here, with "The Big Sleep" that Humphrey Bogart puts his signature stamp on Raymond Chandler's greatest character, Philip Marlowe. "The Big Sleep" is a film that, despite its overly complicated plot remains very watchable because of the players and scenes that make up its whole. Bogart is a marvel in this movie, and his scenes with Lauren Bacall's femme fatale are electric. The dialogue is candy to the ears with a plethora of killer one-liners. You feel like your head is spinning when THE END rolls, but it was such a well-written ride, you just don't care. This is a terrific film in arguably Hollywood's greatest period, and Bogey just plays the hell out of the role. Speaking of Bogart, he's a total babe magnet in this movie. The first half is a series of gorgeous women that just come and go with bit parts. It's crazy how Bond-like he becomes. 8.5/10

    The definitive Humphrey Bogart/Lauren Bacall vehicle, The Big Sleep casts Bogart as Raymond Chandler's cynical private eye Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as the female lead in a film about the "process of a criminal investigation, not its results".This is the first film version of Raymond Chandler's novel of the same title. William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman co-wrote the screenplay; and it was directed by Howard Hawks. Summoned to the home of the fabulously wealthy General Sternwood, Marlowe is hired to deal with a blackmailer shaking down the General's sensuous, thumb-sucking daughter Carmen. This earns Marlowe the displeasure of Carmen's sloe-eyed, seemingly straight-laced older sister Vivian, who is fiercely protective of her somewhat addled sibling. As he pursues the case at hand, Marlowe gets mixed up in the murder of Arthur Geiger, a dealer in pornography. He also runs afoul of gambling-house proprietor Eddie Mars, who seems to have some sort of hold over the enigmatic Vivian. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall made screen history together more than once, but they were never more popular than in this film that is witty and sinister, and in an odd way is a realistic portrayal of big-city life with Arabian Nights overtones.The characters have been transferred to the screen with punch by Howard Hawks' production and direction, providing full load of rough, tense action most of the way.This is one movie that every film student should study and every movie lover should watch at least once.A true classic Bogie and Bacall film indeed.

    Featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I recognised this film because of the easy to remember title and the leading actor and leading actress, I was hoping it would be a film worthy for recommendation, from director Howard Hawks (Scarface, Bringing Up Baby, To Have and Have Not, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Monkey Business). Basically dying General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) in Los Angeles hires private-eye detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart) to supposedly keep an eye on his daughter Carmen Sternwood (Martha Vickers) who owes many gambling debts to bookseller Arthur Gwynn Geiger (Theodore Von Eltz), but it may in fact be his older daughter Vivian (Lauren Bacall) that needs his help. Marlowe goes to find the bookseller, the shop being looked after by assistant Agnes Louzier (Sonia Darrin), and when he tries to talk to Geiger he finds his body instead, along with a drugged Carmen, and later when he returns the body disappears, and the Sternwood driver is found dead too. Vivian comes to see Marlowe with some blackmail type pictures of Carmen, so he goes back to the bookseller's shop and follows a car to the apartment Joe Brody (Louis Jean Heydt), a gambler who has blackmailed the General, and after returning to talk to Carmen she at first denies any knowledge of the Geiger's murder, but then names Brody as the killer. After an encounter with small-time gangster Eddie Mars (John Ridgely), Marlowe, Vivian and Carmen go to see Brody, with Agnes there too, to get the photos back, but an assailant shoots Brody dead, but the shooter, Geiger's former driver Carol Lundgren (Tommy Rafferty) who killed for revenge. Marlowe needs answers from Mars, and after some stooge work and pressing there is some kind of robbery plot revealed, and Carmen reveals that Mars calls Vivian frequently, and then she tries to seduce him but he refuses to give in to it. There is some kind of murder plot by Harry Jones (Elisha Cook Jr.), hired killer Lash Canino (Bob Steele) is sent to kill Agnes or whatever but Marlowe kills him first, and after some more gossip and revelations a meeting is arranged with Mars at Geiger's place. Guns are pulled out as Mars reveals he blackmailed Vivian to claim a crime of murder, in the chase Mars ends up shot accidentally by his own men, Marlowe calls the police and says that the real murder culprit was the gangster, and he assures Vivian that Carmen will get a doctor's help. Also starring Dorothy Malone as Acme Book Shop, Peggy Knudsen as Mona Mars, Regis Toomey as Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls and Charles D. Brown as Norris the Butler. I will absolutely honest and say that I hardly followed any real plot at all, it was pretty complicated, a review even says that it is complex for most people, for the witty script and the performances by real lovers and to-be husband and wife Bogie and Bacall it is a worthwhile classic detective drama. Good!

    The Big Sleep, directed by Howard Hawkins, persistently presents a perplexing but intricate plot line that is filled with sexual tension, speculation, and direct confrontation. The Shamus, Malone, encounters all these matters when he is introduced to the Sternwoods. Carmen, the youngest of daughter of General Sternwood, displays a multitude of sexually promiscuous behaviors. She finds Malone attractive and literally throws herself at him. In that moment Carmen seems raunchy. Her first impression on Malone can easily be abbreviated to less than desirable. Malone comments that the young lassie needs "weaning". The exchanges between Malone and Carmen signify that women need to be supervised because they cannot control themselves. The film also suggests women are cunning. The following decade, the fifties, film undergoes a drastic moral reformation. The depiction of women and their mannerisms in the fifties contradict the behaviors displayed by Carmen. Similarly, Carmen's older sister, Vivian, is forward. Vivian is decisive and sophisticated. She, unlike her hyper-sexual sister, is a tasteful and charming. Vivian and Carmen's interactions with Malone both prove the Sternwood girls are likable. Nevertheless, the affable sisters are jammed in several taboo social circles. Their mischief begins with black mailing and gradually the ladies are snared into relations with gamblers and killers. The unfavorable characters force their presence on the Sternwoods. Malone's hire and personal speculations lead him to solving the disconcerting investigation. Yet, the exploration ends with Vivian and Malone coupling. Even though the plot rifles off seven individuals, the romance manages to develop and transpire during the plot (grouping). It is typical for films to have a romantic aspect. The Big Sleep, no different, also has a romantic component. The spark of the relationship begins at the Sternwood estate. Vivian requests to see Malone and interrogates him. The desire Vivian has for Malone shows when she begins to regularly visit him at his office. The spontaneous run-ins also display the connection between the romantic pair. Through the midst of chaos, protecting a meaningful element in one's life is exposed throughout the big sleep. The spectrum begins with General Sternwood's desired protection of his daughters and extends to Malone's protection of Vivian as a romantic partner. There is also the protection of friends, sibling, and image. The desire to have security seems inevitable. Every person yearns for the proper safety. Some people, Malone and Vivian, find that safety in the love for a romantic partner.

    Unusually for me, this is a rare film where I have read the source novel before viewing the film - it's normally the other way around. Still, this classic film noir is pretty enjoyable in its own right even if the book's complex plot makes following things a touch tricky at times. But what really elevates this film, and what the studio knew at the time given their prominence in the publicity, is the electric chemistry between screen idols Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. It is a joy to watch and lifts what might have been a fairly plodding crime caper into the stuff of legend. Bogart is perfect as Philip Marlowe, a world-weary private detective summoned to the mansion of the aging General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) who asks Marlows for help when he finds himself being blackmailed. The General is convinced that it has something to do with one of his flighty daughters - the good-time-girl Carmen (Martha Vickers) or the femme fatale Vivian (Bacall). But as Marlowe digs a little deeper, it soon appears that everyone has something to hide. Marlowe's investigations turn over some unpleasant stones and as the case gets ever more complex, Marlowe can't help but feel that Vivian is the key... It may be suffering from some excessively dark scenes due to a lack of colourisation but "The Big Sleep" remains the classic film noir. Bogart simply IS Marlowe, wonderfully ragged at the edges and wears the expression of someone who has seen the worst the world has to offer. As a viewer with little exposure to Bogart's work (most of my movies involve at least one explosion), I had always assumed him to be a somewhat limited actor - but he is unmissable, especially when he and Bacall exchange dialogue that crackles with sexual tension and innuendo. The film is probably the closest to Raymond Chandler's vision and does the story justice, although I personally felt that some characters were underwritten and some dialogue felt difficult to understand. Maybe some of the technical advancements that have been made over the last seventy years could help iron out these particular issues but they rarely impede on the film as a whole and I can't score a movie lower just because it's old. But then again, that's part of its charm - there's no CG or big fight scenes to wow the audience but it doesn't need them. If anything, it feels more authentic than a modern version might. I still believe that instead of endless sequels or half-baked ideas like "Battleship", something like this could work as a remake - the era has been captured before in the likes of "LA Confidential" and "Road To Perdition" so why wouldn't it work? It's difficult to think how the magic between Bogie and Bacall could be replicated but that's why this movie is very much recommended - some things just can't be replicated.

    Spoilers near the end! My advice is to meet with this gently, have no thought what it's about, let the burden of names and trifle detail flow through you. Use it like you were calibrating the eye to focus. By itself the film is uninteresting and not really worth the energy required to investigate. On the page, I suppose the situation to have been somehow mitigated by Chandler's wit and prose but the plot is all of it disposable. If I kept on the right track, we have three sets of blackmail, six counts of murder, plus a seventh revealed near the end, and all sorts of trickery, fronts, and storymaking between players. But two sets of unconnected circumstances elevate this to something that is required viewing and working with. The Hays Code was one, a simple effect; none of Chandler's titillation about drugs and pornography could ever reach the big screen, so all the sex is staged between a camera concealed inside a statue and us getting to imagine about it. It works better than if it were explicit. The second one is even more incidental, a boozing Faulkner had shown up from Mississippi to write for the movies. Now I don't presume the finished script was either fully by design or by complete lack of it, since Faulkner didn't care beyond a paycheck, rather the result of handing out Chandler's hard and thin sense of reality to a literary giant of the most awesomely intuitive nature, capable for the most multilayered memory. Add to that reshoots of the film several months later, sexual innuendo between Bacall/Bogart spliced in, a key scene where Marlowe explains the plot left on the cutting room floor, and you already have enough pieces of the puzzle missing. Or what I call the Ambersons Effect, after the Welles film. This a situation where no writer is in full control of the complicated story originally intended, quite clearly in our case. The famous story is that Chandler had to be phoned back to shed some light on the cluster of murders. So we get a twist on Chandler's twist of the story, but following Marlowe's assembly of that story, the culprit is shot to pieces before we have a chance to corroborate. We leave the film thinking Marlowe got it right, had to. Here's where the world of allusive accidents kicks into effect. The framing device, this is where Carmen was going to be framed for murder, is a set of photos and a daze that makes her as a viewer susceptible to stories! Isn't this what happens to us each time we sit in the theater? Chandler controlled the device by using sex and drugs to explain, but that is gone. We just have the mystifying stupor, the girl drowsy in a Chinese dress. We have the concealed camera. We have Marlowe's coolly laid-out solution to the story, after the old blueprint of detective fiction - Holmes, Perry Mason, the mode that Chandler wrote in - so quite independent of the viewer. His snappy rat-ta-tat as he explains is followed moments later by the staccato sound of machine-gun fire. But upon reflection, the thing seems a bit off, ordinary logic broken in the process, this creates strangely ambiguous perturbations through a world we just experienced as rational and finite. Marlowe's story is near as possible as everyone else's, but the entire film leading up to it has been believable stories exposed as fabrication. The alternative reading I prefer, is that Marlowe solves blackmail but in doing so suspects he may have fallen for the wrong woman. So he investigates a second plot that is stories made-up by this woman to guard herself, in the end he unspools this in the only way where she turns out innocent and his instincts right all along. This is great the way we have it, a lesson in the relative dynamics of storytelling. When Marlowe resurfaces for The Long Goodbye, the world has outmaneuevered him in complexity. There is a boozing writer and shown to be destructive. The link is Leigh Brackett.

    All the girls/women in Howard Hawk's 1946 Classic 'The Big Sleep' either want to sit in his lap, remove their reading spectacles for or flirt with Humph in one way or another. Even if they don't actually like him, you can almost smell their respect for him. As we all know, the Raymond Chandler story is both complex and intriguing, but that's only half of it. You can stick this movie on umpteen times (as I do) and there's always bits that seem new and fresh, as well as the those that linger long and deep, like a fabulous fragrance. The story, for me is almost second fiddle, though it could easily be first, if I chose it to be. The period detail, the sharp banter and the suspenseful music, the shady characters, the lurking night-time shadows...I could go on. Howard Hawks did make some great films and this must rate as one of his very best. It's become famous for helping to cement Lauren Bacall's life-long relationship with Humph, probably the most loved and respected (and no doubt, envied) courtship in Hollywood history. The black & white photography is remarkably efficient and deceptively simple, yet has all the detail and complexities it needs. There's a real art in making a movie flow so easily and naturally. ALL those who even think of themselves as movie buffs, film-lovers or really anybody, who appreciates a fine film must see The Big Sleep at least once. It does come up on TCM occasionally and it's well worth the effort in tracking down the DVD. Comment Comment | Permalink
