 <sinopse>
  An eager and idealistic young attorney defends an Alcatraz prisoner accused of murdering a fellow inmate. The extenuating circumstances: his client had just spent over three years in solitary confinement.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Henri Young stole five dollars from a post office and ended up going to prison - to the most famous, or infamous, prison of them all: Alcatraz. He tried to escape, failed, and spent three years and two months in solitary confinement - in a dungeon, with no light, no heat and no toilet. Milton Glenn, the assistant warden, who was given free reign by his duty-shirking superior, was responsible for Young's treatment. Glenn even took a straight razor and hobbled Young for life. After three years and two months, Young was taken out of solitary confinement and put with the rest of the prisoners. Almost immediately, Young took a spoon and stabbed a fellow prisoner in the neck, killing him. Now, Young is on trial for murder, and if he's convicted he'll go to the gas chamber. An eager and idealistic young attorney, James Stamphill, is given this impossible case, and argues before a shocked courtroom that Young had a co-conspirator. The true murderer, he says, was Alcatraz.

    "Murder in the First" struck me as not a bad movie, but not one that I'd care to watch again. The performances are very good and there are no severe problems with the movie. What I felt in watching it is that it was too long and dragged out. At times I thought it was overdone and exaggerated. Courtroom movies have a tendency to bog down or present unrealistic views of how a trial goes. The movie became a heavy-handed indictment of Alcatraz and the penal system, which they entirely deserve, but the method was still too crude to be really effective. The movie story is realistic in a number of important details. But the man on trial was embellished and altered in many ways that detracted. The fictional characterizations felt concocted and unreal, Hollywoodized. So, overall, it was a bit of a slog through it.

    Murder in the First, is a very powerful courtroom/prison drama that features exemplary acting from all three leads. It's a shame a January release hindered this film's award chances. Plus, I'm shocked not many people heard of this great film. Even though this film is not historically accurate, it's still an engaging film with three of the finest performances you will see. Marc Rocco's film is loosely based on Henri Young and his time at Alcatraz. After Young is transferred to the prison with his only crime stealing five dollars to feed his sister, he is inhumanely treated by the associate warden thus leading to a murder. But a young defense lawyer comes to his aid to lessen his charge against him and to prove to the world what a terrible place Alcatraz is. The acting is magnificent to say the least. Kevin Bacon delivers one of his best performances of his career and he shows a wide acting range playing Henri who lacks trust after spending three years in complete darkness. Christian Slater does mighty fine as the lawyer and Gary Oldman, as usual, delivers another impressive performance. Overall, this film is very interesting and it's an emotionally powerful movie. Some of the scenes really moved me especially the one when we find out some hard, cold facts involving the head warden in the courtroom scene. Like most others, I was disappointed when I learned many facts were muddled but still made audience believe the events in the film were true. That being said, I really liked this movie and I find it to be criminally underrated. I rate this film 9/10.

    This is a great movie that, for some reason, no one has seen. I recently bought it because I am a big fan of Kevin Bacon, and I was completely amazed by his performance. The fact that he wasn't even nominated for an academy award shows you what a joke they are. All the actors are great, especially Bacon and Gary Oldman. The story is pretty good, and the movie is never boring, but the highlight of the film is Bacon's haunting portrayal of a man forced into solitary for three years. He manages to be both creepy and touching, which is amazing. There is some violence in the movie, so if you are not a fan of that, you might not want to watch. Other than that, however, I give a strong recommendation to fans of prison and courtroom movies, as this film contains some compelling elements of both. Overall - 8/10

    It is often interesting how when old movies show up On Demand years after their first release there is a waterfall of response from viewers - almost like the film has been resurrected and given a second life. Such is the case for this 1995 film MURDER IN THE FIRST - there seems to be a more honest evaluation of the film as a film than when it was first released and the public took exception to the 'veracity' of the allegedly true story. According to the reported facts, 'Henri Theodore Young (born 1918) was a prisoner at Alcatraz who attempted to escape with four other inmates, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, William Martin, and Rufus McCain. Young became a bank robber and was known for aggressively taking hostages. In 1933, he committed murder. After spending time in prisons in Washington state and Montana, he was sent to the federal prison on Alcatraz Island. On the night of January 13, 1939, Young, with prisoners Rufus McCain, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, and William Martin, attempted to escape. Martin, Young, and McCain surrendered, while Barker and Stamphill refused to surrender and were subsequently shot. Barker eventually died from his injuries. Allegedly, Young and McCain were sentenced to long terms each in solitary confinement, but they were back in the prison's general population within months. A year later, Young killed Rufus McCain by plunging a spoon into his neck; he never revealed his motive.' Those are the 'facts' upon which this film was based, but in the film the sequence is different. The film plot follows: Henri Young (Kevin Bacon) stole five dollars from a post office and ended up going to prison - to the most famous, or infamous, prison of them all: Alcatraz. He tried to escape, failed, and spent three years and two months in solitary confinement - in a dungeon, with no light, no heat and no toilet. Milton Glenn (Gary Oldman), the assistant warden, who was given free reign by his duty-shirking superior, was responsible for Young's treatment. Glenn even took a straight razor and hobbled Young for life. After three years and two months, Young was taken out of solitary confinement and put with the rest of the prisoners. Almost immediately, Young took a spoon and stabbed a fellow prisoner in the neck, killing him. Now, Young is on trial for murder, and if he's convicted he'll go to the gas chamber. An eager and idealistic young attorney, James Stamphill (Christian Slater), is given this impossible case, and argues before a shocked courtroom that Young had a co-conspirator. The true murderer, he says, was Alcatraz. Mark Rocco directed from the screenplay written by Dan Gordon and the film was photographed by Fred Murphy, the tense musical scoring is by Christopher Young. The story is tight and made credible by the extraordinarily fine performances of Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman and a supporting cast that includes Embeth Davidtz, Kyra Sedgwick, Mia Kirshner, William H. Macy, R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Brad Dourif. This is more a character study than reportage of an historical incident and as such the movie succeeds on every level. Grady Harp

    Just happened upon this movie the other night & decided to tape it as I couldn't watch on TNT's schedule. How I missed this movie 17 years ago I'll never know. This is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen! Not only was Kevin Bacon FANTASTIC, Christian Slater GREAT!!! I've never been a big Gary Oldman fan he was also EXCELLENT. I was riveted to my chair throughout the entire movie; wish I'd seen it years ago when it first came out. I grew up in the Bay Area and the scenery indoors and out were spot on! They truly did a great job on this movie.

    Murder in the First is directed by Marc Rocco and written by Dan Gordon. It stars Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman, Embeth Davidtz, William H. Macy and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Christopher Young and cinematography by Fred Murphy. Slater stars as James Stamphill, an idealistic young attorney who is tasked with defending Alcatraz prisoner Henri Young (Bacon) who clearly murdered a fellow inmate. But what transpires is that Henri had just spent over three years in solitary confinement for attempting to escape the prison. It's evident, also, that Henri has been the subject of systematic violence perpetrated by sadistic Warden Milton Glenn (Oldman). Stamphill risks his career, and Henri's life, to put Alcatraz and the people in charge on trial. Inspired by a true story, viewers should note that this is mostly a fictitious film. The truths are readily available on line so I will not waste space divulging the facts here. Suffice to say that Murder in the First is to be judged solely as a work of fiction. But what a film we get, a heart yanking, emotionally upsetting picture showcasing the evil that men do, filling out the narrative with alienation, cruelty, corruption and revenge driven murder. The dehumanising effects of prison abuse has never been so touchingly portrayed as it is here by Bacon, it's a haunting and vivid portrayal of a man pushed to the limits of sanity, a guy living in the dark recess of hell, struggling with every breath to come out into the light. An astonishing performance that once again in Bacon's career was ignored by his Academy peers. Whilst high on emotional wallop, and some scenes really are tough to watch, the film falls shy of brilliance on account of standard fare for the courtroom sequences. Nothing bad but there's a dramatic thrust missing, and it's not Slater's fault, who is good at being sincere and humanist, the script doesn't provide enough thunder in the trial, in fact often it's too low key for its own good. We get a great snippet of what we are missing as Oldman (another great turn as a angry bastard) loses his cool, but more stomping, shouting and legal soul picking was needed. Tech credits are very good. Rocco has a good sense of claustrophobic atmosphere, the scenes in the bowels of the prison perfectly portray Young's disorientation, the dank, dark and wet surroundings in keeping with the prisoner's state of mind. The director also favours an impressive roving camera technique that serves the story well. He also slots in a couple of noirish reflection scenes, one sees Glenn lose his cool while shaving and smash the mirror, the result is a distorted reflection, a showing of a fractured psyche. The other sees a prison visit between Stamphill and Young separated by a piece of glass, their respective reflections at first coming off as grotesque, but then slowly blending into one, a sign that maybe lawyer and prisoner will eventually sing from the same song sheet? It's a film that has found its way on to some neo-noir lists, visually and thematically as regards Bacon's character, that is fair enough. Elsewhere. Murphy's photography is a key component to the tonal flow of the story, while Young's score is a real treat, criminally forgotten it relies on strings and choir for emotive means and succeeds exceptionally well. In support Macy and Davidtz do well with thinly written parts, but Ermey is a joy as the blunderbuss judge presiding over the trial. Nice to see Brad Dourif in the mix as well, even if we ultimately hanker for more of this great character actor. In a year that saw high end emotional drama released with Dead Man Walking and Leaving Las Vegas, Murder in the First sadly had some of its thunder stolen. Which coupled with the fact many refused to accept it fictionalising the Henri Young/Alcatraz story, saw it slip away until the World went internet crazy and it got rediscovered. It deserves to be found still some more, so seek it out film fans. 8/10

    Just about every factual detail of this film is a complete lie, right down to the spelling of Henry Young's name (Henri was an alias of this habitual bank robber and murderer). The whole film is just a high-handed defamation of the U.S. penal system, which did not warrant any such besmirching. I'm surprised that R. Lee Ermey was a part of this film. He probably regrets it by now. The real Henri Young jumped parole in 1972, was last seen in Washington State, and may still be alive and at large today with at least two known homicides to his credit. He was not a non-violent offender at the time he came to Alcatraz, he was serving a sentence for murder and bank robbery! He did not spend 3 years or even three months in solitary after the escape attempt, and murdered McCain over a year after rejoining the general prison population. His solitary time was done in a normal holding cell in the main cell block, with normal lighting, exercise, medical attention, and food supplies throughout the entire period. DO NOT GET YOUR HISTORY FROM Hollywood! They spin sentimentalist lies at every possible opportunity. Check out the facts on "Birdman of Alcatraz" and "Awakenings" for two more infamous pack of lies.

    Kevin Bacon was incredible. See he won for his performance. But so should Christian Slater have. So should the cinematographer. Unique, inventive and incredibly creative camera perspectives. Wonderful historic background interspersed, too. Superlative effort all around. every facet of it. Scenes I glanced away from, but that's just my distaste for depiction of violence. Thought it was tenderly beautiful that Kyra Sedgewick was cast in that cameo, since Bacon is her real life husband. Slater cannot act poorly. He's incapable of it. Everything about it, to say nothing of the theme itself. The lighting, the cryptic cutting every time the point was made without fail, the lingering closeups when humanity was the point.

    Directed by Marc Rocco, Murder In The First (based very loosely on a true story), tells the tale of Alcatraz inmate Henri Young (Bacon) and his treatment at the hands of the Associate Warden and Alcatraz authorities, which subsequently lead to the catastrophic events that set the film in motion. The period is set in the late 1930's. Petty thief Henri Young, played by Kevin Bacon, was sent to Alcatraz previously from another prison to make up the numbers as the infamous Rock was lacking incorrigibles at the time and the numbers needed justification. He and a small party of other prisoners attempt a daring escape which inevitably fails. One of the escapees, Rufus McCain cuts a deal with the Associate Warden Glenn (Gary Oldman) and is rewarded by being sent back to the general prison population. Henri Young is not so lucky and is sent to the dungeons of Alcatraz, commonly referred to as 'The Hole', where he spends a total of 3 years and 2 months in complete solitude, with no light, clothing, toilet or other basic provisions. We then witness Young's gradual descent into insanity as he is cut off from human contact and suffers merciless torture and beatings at the hands of the Warden and the guards there. Young emerges a mere shell of his former self, and almost immediately kills another inmate in the prison canteen. The rest of the movie is focused on the subsequent court case whereby Henri is defended by a young and inexperienced, albeit enthusiastic lawyer James Stamphill, played by Christian Slater. Stamphill attempts to put Alcatraz and it's wardens on trial and expose the conditions there. The movie is a solid one and is gripping enough to keep you watching. Christian Slater's narration leads us through the movie and events. Kevin Bacon is excellent and very convincing as the prisoner making us believe every word and scene. He plays Henri Young as a pathetic, ruined man who is totally at the mercy of Alcatraz. Gary Oldman is great in a supporting role here, playing a sadistic warden almost in a monstrous bureaucratic way. He is given free reign to do what he does in the film and of course Oldman is at his best when playing borderline psychos with underlying anger issues just waiting to boil up. I only wish his character could have been given a little more screen time. Christian Slater is good as the lawyer and is suited for this part. I am often undecided in my opinion of Christian Slater when I watch him, but I feel that in this movie he does what is needed and plays Stamphill as a decent guy who is fundamentally a humanist. Some scenes are brutal and hard to watch, especially the torture scenes in the dungeons where Bacons's character suffers. Some viewers may actually consider this a movie that requires only the one watch, as it kind of leaves a dark impression on the mind. But this is how it was intended to be made. It's not pretending to be anything else. This is undoubtedly a very moving and powerful film that won't disappoint. If you like strong and solid performances then look no further.

    Though A Largely Fictitious Film, about petty criminal Henri Young, 'Murder in the First', yet comes across as a convincing cinematic experience. Though depressing and hard to stomach, the honesty it's been made and it's hallmark performances, manage to hold your interest. 'Murder in the First' is a about a petty criminal named Henri Young, played by Kevin Bacon, who is put on trial for murder in the first degree. But, a righteous recent law school graduate, played by Christian Slater, takes up the challenge to take up Young's case, and later blames the prison's executives, for the brutal murder committed by Young. 'Murder in the First', like mentioned before, is a largely fictitious take on Henri Young's life. But, cinematically, Henri Young comes across as a frightened victim, who was physically & mentally abused by the Prison's executives. You, in fact, support him here and you sympathize with him all through, and you literally begin to hate the prison's executives. The depiction of Young being in a solitary confinement, and knowing his suffering, shakes you and leaves you numb. 'Murder in the First' is an honest film. Dan Gordon's Writing is hard-hitting & on your-face. The Writer hasn't shy-ed away by not showing what your suppose to watch as a viewer. Marc Rocco's Direction is up-to the mark. He handles the dark, as well as the court-room sequences, with accurate understanding. But, I would like to point out, that, the film is longer than it should have been. It needed to be trimmed, at least, by 15-20 minutes. Performance-Wise: All the actors are Great. Kevin Bacon is nearly exemplary as the frightened victim, Henri Young. His body language, his expressions , as well as his dialogue delivery, are pitch-perfect. Bacon once again proves his range as an actor! Christian Slater scores big time as the righteous lawyer. Gary Oldman is Fantastic! He's so good as the menace, I actually began to hate him. Oldman, genuinely, delivers one of his finest performances here. William H. Macy is perfect, like always. Others lend the required support. On the whole, 'Murder in the First' is not the faint-hearted, as it's too intense & depressing at times. But, it's definitely worth a watch for those, who like watching films, that are written & executed without inhibitions. From this writer, Thumbs Up!

    Murder in the First is directed by Marc Rocco and written by Dan Gordon. It stars Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman, Embeth Davidtz, William H. Macy and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Christopher Young and cinematography by Fred Murphy. Slater stars as James Stamphill, an idealistic young attorney who is tasked with defending Alcatraz prisoner Henri Young (Bacon) who clearly murdered a fellow inmate. But what transpires is that Henri had just spent over three years in solitary confinement for attempting to escape the prison. It's evident, also, that Henri has been the subject of systematic violence perpetrated by sadistic Warden Milton Glenn (Oldman). Stamphill risks his career, and Henri's life, to put Alcatraz and the people in charge on trial. Inspired by a true story, viewers should note that this is mostly a fictitious film. The truths are readily available on line so I will not waste space divulging the facts here. Suffice to say that Murder in the First is to be judged solely as a work of fiction. But what a film we get, a heart yanking, emotionally upsetting picture showcasing the evil that men do, filling out the narrative with alienation, cruelty, corruption and revenge driven murder. The dehumanising effects of prison abuse has never been so touchingly portrayed as it is here by Bacon, it's a haunting and vivid portrayal of a man pushed to the limits of sanity, a guy living in the dark recess of hell, struggling with every breath to come out into the light. An astonishing performance that once again in Bacon's career was ignored by his Academy peers. Whilst high on emotional wallop, and some scenes really are tough to watch, the film falls shy of brilliance on account of standard fare for the courtroom sequences. Nothing bad but there's a dramatic thrust missing, and it's not Slater's fault, who is good at being sincere and humanist, the script doesn't provide enough thunder in the trial, in fact often it's too low key for its own good. We get a great snippet of what we are missing as Oldman (another great turn as a angry bastard) loses his cool, but more stomping, shouting and legal soul picking was needed. Tech credits are very good. Rocco has a good sense of claustrophobic atmosphere, the scenes in the bowels of the prison perfectly portray Young's disorientation, the dank, dark and wet surroundings in keeping with the prisoner's state of mind. The director also favours an impressive roving camera technique that serves the story well. He also slots in a couple of noirish reflection scenes, one sees Glenn lose his cool while shaving and smash the mirror, the result is a distorted reflection, a showing of a fractured psyche. The other sees a prison visit between Stamphill and Young separated by a piece of glass, their respective reflections at first coming off as grotesque, but then slowly blending into one, a sign that maybe lawyer and prisoner will eventually sing from the same song sheet? It's a film that has found its way on to some neo-noir lists, visually and thematically as regards Bacon's character, that is fair enough. Elsewhere. Murphy's photography is a key component to the tonal flow of the story, while Young's score is a real treat, criminally forgotten it relies on strings and choir for emotive means and succeeds exceptionally well. In support Macy and Davidtz do well with thinly written parts, but Ermey is a joy as the blunderbuss judge presiding over the trial. Nice to see Brad Dourif in the mix as well, even if we ultimately hanker for more of this great character actor. In a year that saw high end emotional drama released with Dead Man Walking and Leaving Las Vegas, Murder in the First sadly had some of its thunder stolen. Which coupled with the fact many refused to accept it fictionalising the Henri Young/Alcatraz story, saw it slip away until the World went internet crazy and it got rediscovered. It deserves to be found still some more, so seek it out film fans. 8/10

    Just about every factual detail of this film is a complete lie, right down to the spelling of Henry Young's name (Henri was an alias of this habitual bank robber and murderer). The whole film is just a high-handed defamation of the U.S. penal system, which did not warrant any such besmirching. I'm surprised that R. Lee Ermey was a part of this film. He probably regrets it by now. The real Henri Young jumped parole in 1972, was last seen in Washington State, and may still be alive and at large today with at least two known homicides to his credit. He was not a non-violent offender at the time he came to Alcatraz, he was serving a sentence for murder and bank robbery! He did not spend 3 years or even three months in solitary after the escape attempt, and murdered McCain over a year after rejoining the general prison population. His solitary time was done in a normal holding cell in the main cell block, with normal lighting, exercise, medical attention, and food supplies throughout the entire period. DO NOT GET YOUR HISTORY FROM Hollywood! They spin sentimentalist lies at every possible opportunity. Check out the facts on "Birdman of Alcatraz" and "Awakenings" for two more infamous pack of lies.

    Kevin Bacon was incredible. See he won for his performance. But so should Christian Slater have. So should the cinematographer. Unique, inventive and incredibly creative camera perspectives. Wonderful historic background interspersed, too. Superlative effort all around. every facet of it. Scenes I glanced away from, but that's just my distaste for depiction of violence. Thought it was tenderly beautiful that Kyra Sedgewick was cast in that cameo, since Bacon is her real life husband. Slater cannot act poorly. He's incapable of it. Everything about it, to say nothing of the theme itself. The lighting, the cryptic cutting every time the point was made without fail, the lingering closeups when humanity was the point.

    Directed by Marc Rocco, Murder In The First (based very loosely on a true story), tells the tale of Alcatraz inmate Henri Young (Bacon) and his treatment at the hands of the Associate Warden and Alcatraz authorities, which subsequently lead to the catastrophic events that set the film in motion. The period is set in the late 1930's. Petty thief Henri Young, played by Kevin Bacon, was sent to Alcatraz previously from another prison to make up the numbers as the infamous Rock was lacking incorrigibles at the time and the numbers needed justification. He and a small party of other prisoners attempt a daring escape which inevitably fails. One of the escapees, Rufus McCain cuts a deal with the Associate Warden Glenn (Gary Oldman) and is rewarded by being sent back to the general prison population. Henri Young is not so lucky and is sent to the dungeons of Alcatraz, commonly referred to as 'The Hole', where he spends a total of 3 years and 2 months in complete solitude, with no light, clothing, toilet or other basic provisions. We then witness Young's gradual descent into insanity as he is cut off from human contact and suffers merciless torture and beatings at the hands of the Warden and the guards there. Young emerges a mere shell of his former self, and almost immediately kills another inmate in the prison canteen. The rest of the movie is focused on the subsequent court case whereby Henri is defended by a young and inexperienced, albeit enthusiastic lawyer James Stamphill, played by Christian Slater. Stamphill attempts to put Alcatraz and it's wardens on trial and expose the conditions there. The movie is a solid one and is gripping enough to keep you watching. Christian Slater's narration leads us through the movie and events. Kevin Bacon is excellent and very convincing as the prisoner making us believe every word and scene. He plays Henri Young as a pathetic, ruined man who is totally at the mercy of Alcatraz. Gary Oldman is great in a supporting role here, playing a sadistic warden almost in a monstrous bureaucratic way. He is given free reign to do what he does in the film and of course Oldman is at his best when playing borderline psychos with underlying anger issues just waiting to boil up. I only wish his character could have been given a little more screen time. Christian Slater is good as the lawyer and is suited for this part. I am often undecided in my opinion of Christian Slater when I watch him, but I feel that in this movie he does what is needed and plays Stamphill as a decent guy who is fundamentally a humanist. Some scenes are brutal and hard to watch, especially the torture scenes in the dungeons where Bacons's character suffers. Some viewers may actually consider this a movie that requires only the one watch, as it kind of leaves a dark impression on the mind. But this is how it was intended to be made. It's not pretending to be anything else. This is undoubtedly a very moving and powerful film that won't disappoint. If you like strong and solid performances then look no further.

    Though A Largely Fictitious Film, about petty criminal Henri Young, 'Murder in the First', yet comes across as a convincing cinematic experience. Though depressing and hard to stomach, the honesty it's been made and it's hallmark performances, manage to hold your interest. 'Murder in the First' is a about a petty criminal named Henri Young, played by Kevin Bacon, who is put on trial for murder in the first degree. But, a righteous recent law school graduate, played by Christian Slater, takes up the challenge to take up Young's case, and later blames the prison's executives, for the brutal murder committed by Young. 'Murder in the First', like mentioned before, is a largely fictitious take on Henri Young's life. But, cinematically, Henri Young comes across as a frightened victim, who was physically & mentally abused by the Prison's executives. You, in fact, support him here and you sympathize with him all through, and you literally begin to hate the prison's executives. The depiction of Young being in a solitary confinement, and knowing his suffering, shakes you and leaves you numb. 'Murder in the First' is an honest film. Dan Gordon's Writing is hard-hitting & on your-face. The Writer hasn't shy-ed away by not showing what your suppose to watch as a viewer. Marc Rocco's Direction is up-to the mark. He handles the dark, as well as the court-room sequences, with accurate understanding. But, I would like to point out, that, the film is longer than it should have been. It needed to be trimmed, at least, by 15-20 minutes. Performance-Wise: All the actors are Great. Kevin Bacon is nearly exemplary as the frightened victim, Henri Young. His body language, his expressions , as well as his dialogue delivery, are pitch-perfect. Bacon once again proves his range as an actor! Christian Slater scores big time as the righteous lawyer. Gary Oldman is Fantastic! He's so good as the menace, I actually began to hate him. Oldman, genuinely, delivers one of his finest performances here. William H. Macy is perfect, like always. Others lend the required support. On the whole, 'Murder in the First' is not the faint-hearted, as it's too intense & depressing at times. But, it's definitely worth a watch for those, who like watching films, that are written & executed without inhibitions. From this writer, Thumbs Up!

    "Murder in the First" struck me as not a bad movie, but not one that I'd care to watch again. The performances are very good and there are no severe problems with the movie. What I felt in watching it is that it was too long and dragged out. At times I thought it was overdone and exaggerated. Courtroom movies have a tendency to bog down or present unrealistic views of how a trial goes. The movie became a heavy-handed indictment of Alcatraz and the penal system, which they entirely deserve, but the method was still too crude to be really effective. The movie story is realistic in a number of important details. But the man on trial was embellished and altered in many ways that detracted. The fictional characterizations felt concocted and unreal, Hollywoodized. So, overall, it was a bit of a slog through it.

    Murder in the First, is a very powerful courtroom/prison drama that features exemplary acting from all three leads. It's a shame a January release hindered this film's award chances. Plus, I'm shocked not many people heard of this great film. Even though this film is not historically accurate, it's still an engaging film with three of the finest performances you will see. Marc Rocco's film is loosely based on Henri Young and his time at Alcatraz. After Young is transferred to the prison with his only crime stealing five dollars to feed his sister, he is inhumanely treated by the associate warden thus leading to a murder. But a young defense lawyer comes to his aid to lessen his charge against him and to prove to the world what a terrible place Alcatraz is. The acting is magnificent to say the least. Kevin Bacon delivers one of his best performances of his career and he shows a wide acting range playing Henri who lacks trust after spending three years in complete darkness. Christian Slater does mighty fine as the lawyer and Gary Oldman, as usual, delivers another impressive performance. Overall, this film is very interesting and it's an emotionally powerful movie. Some of the scenes really moved me especially the one when we find out some hard, cold facts involving the head warden in the courtroom scene. Like most others, I was disappointed when I learned many facts were muddled but still made audience believe the events in the film were true. That being said, I really liked this movie and I find it to be criminally underrated. I rate this film 9/10.

    This is a great movie that, for some reason, no one has seen. I recently bought it because I am a big fan of Kevin Bacon, and I was completely amazed by his performance. The fact that he wasn't even nominated for an academy award shows you what a joke they are. All the actors are great, especially Bacon and Gary Oldman. The story is pretty good, and the movie is never boring, but the highlight of the film is Bacon's haunting portrayal of a man forced into solitary for three years. He manages to be both creepy and touching, which is amazing. There is some violence in the movie, so if you are not a fan of that, you might not want to watch. Other than that, however, I give a strong recommendation to fans of prison and courtroom movies, as this film contains some compelling elements of both. Overall - 8/10

    It is often interesting how when old movies show up On Demand years after their first release there is a waterfall of response from viewers - almost like the film has been resurrected and given a second life. Such is the case for this 1995 film MURDER IN THE FIRST - there seems to be a more honest evaluation of the film as a film than when it was first released and the public took exception to the 'veracity' of the allegedly true story. According to the reported facts, 'Henri Theodore Young (born 1918) was a prisoner at Alcatraz who attempted to escape with four other inmates, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, William Martin, and Rufus McCain. Young became a bank robber and was known for aggressively taking hostages. In 1933, he committed murder. After spending time in prisons in Washington state and Montana, he was sent to the federal prison on Alcatraz Island. On the night of January 13, 1939, Young, with prisoners Rufus McCain, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, and William Martin, attempted to escape. Martin, Young, and McCain surrendered, while Barker and Stamphill refused to surrender and were subsequently shot. Barker eventually died from his injuries. Allegedly, Young and McCain were sentenced to long terms each in solitary confinement, but they were back in the prison's general population within months. A year later, Young killed Rufus McCain by plunging a spoon into his neck; he never revealed his motive.' Those are the 'facts' upon which this film was based, but in the film the sequence is different. The film plot follows: Henri Young (Kevin Bacon) stole five dollars from a post office and ended up going to prison - to the most famous, or infamous, prison of them all: Alcatraz. He tried to escape, failed, and spent three years and two months in solitary confinement - in a dungeon, with no light, no heat and no toilet. Milton Glenn (Gary Oldman), the assistant warden, who was given free reign by his duty-shirking superior, was responsible for Young's treatment. Glenn even took a straight razor and hobbled Young for life. After three years and two months, Young was taken out of solitary confinement and put with the rest of the prisoners. Almost immediately, Young took a spoon and stabbed a fellow prisoner in the neck, killing him. Now, Young is on trial for murder, and if he's convicted he'll go to the gas chamber. An eager and idealistic young attorney, James Stamphill (Christian Slater), is given this impossible case, and argues before a shocked courtroom that Young had a co-conspirator. The true murderer, he says, was Alcatraz. Mark Rocco directed from the screenplay written by Dan Gordon and the film was photographed by Fred Murphy, the tense musical scoring is by Christopher Young. The story is tight and made credible by the extraordinarily fine performances of Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman and a supporting cast that includes Embeth Davidtz, Kyra Sedgwick, Mia Kirshner, William H. Macy, R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Brad Dourif. This is more a character study than reportage of an historical incident and as such the movie succeeds on every level. Grady Harp

    Just happened upon this movie the other night & decided to tape it as I couldn't watch on TNT's schedule. How I missed this movie 17 years ago I'll never know. This is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen! Not only was Kevin Bacon FANTASTIC, Christian Slater GREAT!!! I've never been a big Gary Oldman fan he was also EXCELLENT. I was riveted to my chair throughout the entire movie; wish I'd seen it years ago when it first came out. I grew up in the Bay Area and the scenery indoors and out were spot on! They truly did a great job on this movie.

But, it's definitely worth a watch for those, who like watching films, that are written & executed without inhibitions. From this writer, Thumbs Up!

    "Murder in the First" struck me as not a bad movie, but not one that I'd care to watch again. The performances are very good and there are no severe problems with the movie. What I felt in watching it is that it was too long and dragged out. At times I thought it was overdone and exaggerated. Courtroom movies have a tendency to bog down or present unrealistic views of how a trial goes. The movie became a heavy-handed indictment of Alcatraz and the penal system, which they entirely deserve, but the method was still too crude to be really effective. The movie story is realistic in a number of important details. But the man on trial was embellished and altered in many ways that detracted. The fictional characterizations felt concocted and unreal, Hollywoodized. So, overall, it was a bit of a slog through it.

    Murder in the First, is a very powerful courtroom/prison drama that features exemplary acting from all three leads. It's a shame a January release hindered this film's award chances. Plus, I'm shocked not many people heard of this great film. Even though this film is not historically accurate, it's still an engaging film with three of the finest performances you will see. Marc Rocco's film is loosely based on Henri Young and his time at Alcatraz. After Young is transferred to the prison with his only crime stealing five dollars to feed his sister, he is inhumanely treated by the associate warden thus leading to a murder. But a young defense lawyer comes to his aid to lessen his charge against him and to prove to the world what a terrible place Alcatraz is. The acting is magnificent to say the least. Kevin Bacon delivers one of his best performances of his career and he shows a wide acting range playing Henri who lacks trust after spending three years in complete darkness. Christian Slater does mighty fine as the lawyer and Gary Oldman, as usual, delivers another impressive performance. Overall, this film is very interesting and it's an emotionally powerful movie. Some of the scenes really moved me especially the one when we find out some hard, cold facts involving the head warden in the courtroom scene. Like most others, I was disappointed when I learned many facts were muddled but still made audience believe the events in the film were true. That being said, I really liked this movie and I find it to be criminally underrated. I rate this film 9/10.

    This is a great movie that, for some reason, no one has seen. I recently bought it because I am a big fan of Kevin Bacon, and I was completely amazed by his performance. The fact that he wasn't even nominated for an academy award shows you what a joke they are. All the actors are great, especially Bacon and Gary Oldman. The story is pretty good, and the movie is never boring, but the highlight of the film is Bacon's haunting portrayal of a man forced into solitary for three years. He manages to be both creepy and touching, which is amazing. There is some violence in the movie, so if you are not a fan of that, you might not want to watch. Other than that, however, I give a strong recommendation to fans of prison and courtroom movies, as this film contains some compelling elements of both. Overall - 8/10

    It is often interesting how when old movies show up On Demand years after their first release there is a waterfall of response from viewers - almost like the film has been resurrected and given a second life. Such is the case for this 1995 film MURDER IN THE FIRST - there seems to be a more honest evaluation of the film as a film than when it was first released and the public took exception to the 'veracity' of the allegedly true story. According to the reported facts, 'Henri Theodore Young (born 1918) was a prisoner at Alcatraz who attempted to escape with four other inmates, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, William Martin, and Rufus McCain. Young became a bank robber and was known for aggressively taking hostages. In 1933, he committed murder. After spending time in prisons in Washington state and Montana, he was sent to the federal prison on Alcatraz Island. On the night of January 13, 1939, Young, with prisoners Rufus McCain, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, and William Martin, attempted to escape. Martin, Young, and McCain surrendered, while Barker and Stamphill refused to surrender and were subsequently shot. Barker eventually died from his injuries. Allegedly, Young and McCain were sentenced to long terms each in solitary confinement, but they were back in the prison's general population within months. A year later, Young killed Rufus McCain by plunging a spoon into his neck; he never revealed his motive.' Those are the 'facts' upon which this film was based, but in the film the sequence is different. The film plot follows: Henri Young (Kevin Bacon) stole five dollars from a post office and ended up going to prison - to the most famous, or infamous, prison of them all: Alcatraz. He tried to escape, failed, and spent three years and two months in solitary confinement - in a dungeon, with no light, no heat and no toilet. Milton Glenn (Gary Oldman), the assistant warden, who was given free reign by his duty-shirking superior, was responsible for Young's treatment. Glenn even took a straight razor and hobbled Young for life. After three years and two months, Young was taken out of solitary confinement and put with the rest of the prisoners. Almost immediately, Young took a spoon and stabbed a fellow prisoner in the neck, killing him. Now, Young is on trial for murder, and if he's convicted he'll go to the gas chamber. An eager and idealistic young attorney, James Stamphill (Christian Slater), is given this impossible case, and argues before a shocked courtroom that Young had a co-conspirator. The true murderer, he says, was Alcatraz. Mark Rocco directed from the screenplay written by Dan Gordon and the film was photographed by Fred Murphy, the tense musical scoring is by Christopher Young. The story is tight and made credible by the extraordinarily fine performances of Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman and a supporting cast that includes Embeth Davidtz, Kyra Sedgwick, Mia Kirshner, William H. Macy, R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Brad Dourif. This is more a character study than reportage of an historical incident and as such the movie succeeds on every level. Grady Harp

    Just happened upon this movie the other night & decided to tape it as I couldn't watch on TNT's schedule. How I missed this movie 17 years ago I'll never know. This is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen! Not only was Kevin Bacon FANTASTIC, Christian Slater GREAT!!! I've never been a big Gary Oldman fan he was also EXCELLENT. I was riveted to my chair throughout the entire movie; wish I'd seen it years ago when it first came out. I grew up in the Bay Area and the scenery indoors and out were spot on! They truly did a great job on this movie.

    Murder in the First is directed by Marc Rocco and written by Dan Gordon. It stars Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman, Embeth Davidtz, William H. Macy and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Christopher Young and cinematography by Fred Murphy. Slater stars as James Stamphill, an idealistic young attorney who is tasked with defending Alcatraz prisoner Henri Young (Bacon) who clearly murdered a fellow inmate. But what transpires is that Henri had just spent over three years in solitary confinement for attempting to escape the prison. It's evident, also, that Henri has been the subject of systematic violence perpetrated by sadistic Warden Milton Glenn (Oldman). Stamphill risks his career, and Henri's life, to put Alcatraz and the people in charge on trial. Inspired by a true story, viewers should note that this is mostly a fictitious film. The truths are readily available on line so I will not waste space divulging the facts here. Suffice to say that Murder in the First is to be judged solely as a work of fiction. But what a film we get, a heart yanking, emotionally upsetting picture showcasing the evil that men do, filling out the narrative with alienation, cruelty, corruption and revenge driven murder. The dehumanising effects of prison abuse has never been so touchingly portrayed as it is here by Bacon, it's a haunting and vivid portrayal of a man pushed to the limits of sanity, a guy living in the dark recess of hell, struggling with every breath to come out into the light. An astonishing performance that once again in Bacon's career was ignored by his Academy peers. Whilst high on emotional wallop, and some scenes really are tough to watch, the film falls shy of brilliance on account of standard fare for the courtroom sequences. Nothing bad but there's a dramatic thrust missing, and it's not Slater's fault, who is good at being sincere and humanist, the script doesn't provide enough thunder in the trial, in fact often it's too low key for its own good. We get a great snippet of what we are missing as Oldman (another great turn as a angry bastard) loses his cool, but more stomping, shouting and legal soul picking was needed. Tech credits are very good. Rocco has a good sense of claustrophobic atmosphere, the scenes in the bowels of the prison perfectly portray Young's disorientation, the dank, dark and wet surroundings in keeping with the prisoner's state of mind. The director also favours an impressive roving camera technique that serves the story well. He also slots in a couple of noirish reflection scenes, one sees Glenn lose his cool while shaving and smash the mirror, the result is a distorted reflection, a showing of a fractured psyche. The other sees a prison visit between Stamphill and Young separated by a piece of glass, their respective reflections at first coming off as grotesque, but then slowly blending into one, a sign that maybe lawyer and prisoner will eventually sing from the same song sheet? It's a film that has found its way on to some neo-noir lists, visually and thematically as regards Bacon's character, that is fair enough. Elsewhere. Murphy's photography is a key component to the tonal flow of the story, while Young's score is a real treat, criminally forgotten it relies on strings and choir for emotive means and succeeds exceptionally well. In support Macy and Davidtz do well with thinly written parts, but Ermey is a joy as the blunderbuss judge presiding over the trial. Nice to see Brad Dourif in the mix as well, even if we ultimately hanker for more of this great character actor. In a year that saw high end emotional drama released with Dead Man Walking and Leaving Las Vegas, Murder in the First sadly had some of its thunder stolen. Which coupled with the fact many refused to accept it fictionalising the Henri Young/Alcatraz story, saw it slip away until the World went internet crazy and it got rediscovered. It deserves to be found still some more, so seek it out film fans. 8/10

    Just about every factual detail of this film is a complete lie, right down to the spelling of Henry Young's name (Henri was an alias of this habitual bank robber and murderer). The whole film is just a high-handed defamation of the U.S. penal system, which did not warrant any such besmirching. I'm surprised that R. Lee Ermey was a part of this film. He probably regrets it by now. The real Henri Young jumped parole in 1972, was last seen in Washington State, and may still be alive and at large today with at least two known homicides to his credit. He was not a non-violent offender at the time he came to Alcatraz, he was serving a sentence for murder and bank robbery! He did not spend 3 years or even three months in solitary after the escape attempt, and murdered McCain over a year after rejoining the general prison population. His solitary time was done in a normal holding cell in the main cell block, with normal lighting, exercise, medical attention, and food supplies throughout the entire period. DO NOT GET YOUR HISTORY FROM Hollywood! They spin sentimentalist lies at every possible opportunity. Check out the facts on "Birdman of Alcatraz" and "Awakenings" for two more infamous pack of lies.

    Kevin Bacon was incredible. See he won for his performance. But so should Christian Slater have. So should the cinematographer. Unique, inventive and incredibly creative camera perspectives. Wonderful historic background interspersed, too. Superlative effort all around. every facet of it. Scenes I glanced away from, but that's just my distaste for depiction of violence. Thought it was tenderly beautiful that Kyra Sedgewick was cast in that cameo, since Bacon is her real life husband. Slater cannot act poorly. He's incapable of it. Everything about it, to say nothing of the theme itself. The lighting, the cryptic cutting every time the point was made without fail, the lingering closeups when humanity was the point.

    Directed by Marc Rocco, Murder In The First (based very loosely on a true story), tells the tale of Alcatraz inmate Henri Young (Bacon) and his treatment at the hands of the Associate Warden and Alcatraz authorities, which subsequently lead to the catastrophic events that set the film in motion. The period is set in the late 1930's. Petty thief Henri Young, played by Kevin Bacon, was sent to Alcatraz previously from another prison to make up the numbers as the infamous Rock was lacking incorrigibles at the time and the numbers needed justification. He and a small party of other prisoners attempt a daring escape which inevitably fails. One of the escapees, Rufus McCain cuts a deal with the Associate Warden Glenn (Gary Oldman) and is rewarded by being sent back to the general prison population. Henri Young is not so lucky and is sent to the dungeons of Alcatraz, commonly referred to as 'The Hole', where he spends a total of 3 years and 2 months in complete solitude, with no light, clothing, toilet or other basic provisions. We then witness Young's gradual descent into insanity as he is cut off from human contact and suffers merciless torture and beatings at the hands of the Warden and the guards there. Young emerges a mere shell of his former self, and almost immediately kills another inmate in the prison canteen. The rest of the movie is focused on the subsequent court case whereby Henri is defended by a young and inexperienced, albeit enthusiastic lawyer James Stamphill, played by Christian Slater. Stamphill attempts to put Alcatraz and it's wardens on trial and expose the conditions there. The movie is a solid one and is gripping enough to keep you watching. Christian Slater's narration leads us through the movie and events. Kevin Bacon is excellent and very convincing as the prisoner making us believe every word and scene. He plays Henri Young as a pathetic, ruined man who is totally at the mercy of Alcatraz. Gary Oldman is great in a supporting role here, playing a sadistic warden almost in a monstrous bureaucratic way. He is given free reign to do what he does in the film and of course Oldman is at his best when playing borderline psychos with underlying anger issues just waiting to boil up. I only wish his character could have been given a little more screen time. Christian Slater is good as the lawyer and is suited for this part. I am often undecided in my opinion of Christian Slater when I watch him, but I feel that in this movie he does what is needed and plays Stamphill as a decent guy who is fundamentally a humanist. Some scenes are brutal and hard to watch, especially the torture scenes in the dungeons where Bacons's character suffers. Some viewers may actually consider this a movie that requires only the one watch, as it kind of leaves a dark impression on the mind. But this is how it was intended to be made. It's not pretending to be anything else. This is undoubtedly a very moving and powerful film that won't disappoint. If you like strong and solid performances then look no further.

    Though A Largely Fictitious Film, about petty criminal Henri Young, 'Murder in the First', yet comes across as a convincing cinematic experience. Though depressing and hard to stomach, the honesty it's been made and it's hallmark performances, manage to hold your interest. 'Murder in the First' is a about a petty criminal named Henri Young, played by Kevin Bacon, who is put on trial for murder in the first degree. But, a righteous recent law school graduate, played by Christian Slater, takes up the challenge to take up Young's case, and later blames the prison's executives, for the brutal murder committed by Young. 'Murder in the First', like mentioned before, is a largely fictitious take on Henri Young's life. But, cinematically, Henri Young comes across as a frightened victim, who was physically & mentally abused by the Prison's executives. You, in fact, support him here and you sympathize with him all through, and you literally begin to hate the prison's executives. The depiction of Young being in a solitary confinement, and knowing his suffering, shakes you and leaves you numb. 'Murder in the First' is an honest film. Dan Gordon's Writing is hard-hitting & on your-face. The Writer hasn't shy-ed away by not showing what your suppose to watch as a viewer. Marc Rocco's Direction is up-to the mark. He handles the dark, as well as the court-room sequences, with accurate understanding. But, I would like to point out, that, the film is longer than it should have been. It needed to be trimmed, at least, by 15-20 minutes. Performance-Wise: All the actors are Great. Kevin Bacon is nearly exemplary as the frightened victim, Henri Young. His body language, his expressions , as well as his dialogue delivery, are pitch-perfect. Bacon once again proves his range as an actor! Christian Slater scores big time as the righteous lawyer. Gary Oldman is Fantastic! He's so good as the menace, I actually began to hate him. Oldman, genuinely, delivers one of his finest performances here. William H. Macy is perfect, like always. Others lend the required support. On the whole, 'Murder in the First' is not the faint-hearted, as it's too intense & depressing at times. But, it's definitely worth a watch for those, who like watching films, that are written & executed without inhibitions. From this writer, Thumbs Up!

He also slots in a couple of noirish reflection scenes, one sees Glenn lose his cool while shaving and smash the mirror, the result is a distorted reflection, a showing of a fractured psyche. The other sees a prison visit between Stamphill and Young separated by a piece of glass, their respective reflections at first coming off as grotesque, but then slowly blending into one, a sign that maybe lawyer and prisoner will eventually sing from the same song sheet? It's a film that has found its way on to some neo-noir lists, visually and thematically as regards Bacon's character, that is fair enough. Elsewhere. Murphy's photography is a key component to the tonal flow of the story, while Young's score is a real treat, criminally forgotten it relies on strings and choir for emotive means and succeeds exceptionally well. In support Macy and Davidtz do well with thinly written parts, but Ermey is a joy as the blunderbuss judge presiding over the trial. Nice to see Brad Dourif in the mix as well, even if we ultimately hanker for more of this great character actor. In a year that saw high end emotional drama released with Dead Man Walking and Leaving Las Vegas, Murder in the First sadly had some of its thunder stolen. Which coupled with the fact many refused to accept it fictionalising the Henri Young/Alcatraz story, saw it slip away until the World went internet crazy and it got rediscovered. It deserves to be found still some more, so seek it out film fans. 8/10

    Just about every factual detail of this film is a complete lie, right down to the spelling of Henry Young's name (Henri was an alias of this habitual bank robber and murderer). The whole film is just a high-handed defamation of the U.S. penal system, which did not warrant any such besmirching. I'm surprised that R. Lee Ermey was a part of this film. He probably regrets it by now. The real Henri Young jumped parole in 1972, was last seen in Washington State, and may still be alive and at large today with at least two known homicides to his credit. He was not a non-violent offender at the time he came to Alcatraz, he was serving a sentence for murder and bank robbery! He did not spend 3 years or even three months in solitary after the escape attempt, and murdered McCain over a year after rejoining the general prison population. His solitary time was done in a normal holding cell in the main cell block, with normal lighting, exercise, medical attention, and food supplies throughout the entire period. DO NOT GET YOUR HISTORY FROM Hollywood! They spin sentimentalist lies at every possible opportunity. Check out the facts on "Birdman of Alcatraz" and "Awakenings" for two more infamous pack of lies.

    Kevin Bacon was incredible. See he won for his performance. But so should Christian Slater have. So should the cinematographer. Unique, inventive and incredibly creative camera perspectives. Wonderful historic background interspersed, too. Superlative effort all around. every facet of it. Scenes I glanced away from, but that's just my distaste for depiction of violence. Thought it was tenderly beautiful that Kyra Sedgewick was cast in that cameo, since Bacon is her real life husband. Slater cannot act poorly. He's incapable of it. Everything about it, to say nothing of the theme itself. The lighting, the cryptic cutting every time the point was made without fail, the lingering closeups when humanity was the point.

    Directed by Marc Rocco, Murder In The First (based very loosely on a true story), tells the tale of Alcatraz inmate Henri Young (Bacon) and his treatment at the hands of the Associate Warden and Alcatraz authorities, which subsequently lead to the catastrophic events that set the film in motion. The period is set in the late 1930's. Petty thief Henri Young, played by Kevin Bacon, was sent to Alcatraz previously from another prison to make up the numbers as the infamous Rock was lacking incorrigibles at the time and the numbers needed justification. He and a small party of other prisoners attempt a daring escape which inevitably fails. One of the escapees, Rufus McCain cuts a deal with the Associate Warden Glenn (Gary Oldman) and is rewarded by being sent back to the general prison population. Henri Young is not so lucky and is sent to the dungeons of Alcatraz, commonly referred to as 'The Hole', where he spends a total of 3 years and 2 months in complete solitude, with no light, clothing, toilet or other basic provisions. We then witness Young's gradual descent into insanity as he is cut off from human contact and suffers merciless torture and beatings at the hands of the Warden and the guards there. Young emerges a mere shell of his former self, and almost immediately kills another inmate in the prison canteen. The rest of the movie is focused on the subsequent court case whereby Henri is defended by a young and inexperienced, albeit enthusiastic lawyer James Stamphill, played by Christian Slater. Stamphill attempts to put Alcatraz and it's wardens on trial and expose the conditions there. The movie is a solid one and is gripping enough to keep you watching. Christian Slater's narration leads us through the movie and events. Kevin Bacon is excellent and very convincing as the prisoner making us believe every word and scene. He plays Henri Young as a pathetic, ruined man who is totally at the mercy of Alcatraz. Gary Oldman is great in a supporting role here, playing a sadistic warden almost in a monstrous bureaucratic way. He is given free reign to do what he does in the film and of course Oldman is at his best when playing borderline psychos with underlying anger issues just waiting to boil up. I only wish his character could have been given a little more screen time. Christian Slater is good as the lawyer and is suited for this part. I am often undecided in my opinion of Christian Slater when I watch him, but I feel that in this movie he does what is needed and plays Stamphill as a decent guy who is fundamentally a humanist. Some scenes are brutal and hard to watch, especially the torture scenes in the dungeons where Bacons's character suffers. Some viewers may actually consider this a movie that requires only the one watch, as it kind of leaves a dark impression on the mind. But this is how it was intended to be made. It's not pretending to be anything else. This is undoubtedly a very moving and powerful film that won't disappoint. If you like strong and solid performances then look no further.

    Though A Largely Fictitious Film, about petty criminal Henri Young, 'Murder in the First', yet comes across as a convincing cinematic experience. Though depressing and hard to stomach, the honesty it's been made and it's hallmark performances, manage to hold your interest. 'Murder in the First' is a about a petty criminal named Henri Young, played by Kevin Bacon, who is put on trial for murder in the first degree. But, a righteous recent law school graduate, played by Christian Slater, takes up the challenge to take up Young's case, and later blames the prison's executives, for the brutal murder committed by Young. 'Murder in the First', like mentioned before, is a largely fictitious take on Henri Young's life. But, cinematically, Henri Young comes across as a frightened victim, who was physically & mentally abused by the Prison's executives. You, in fact, support him here and you sympathize with him all through, and you literally begin to hate the prison's executives. The depiction of Young being in a solitary confinement, and knowing his suffering, shakes you and leaves you numb. 'Murder in the First' is an honest film. Dan Gordon's Writing is hard-hitting & on your-face. The Writer hasn't shy-ed away by not showing what your suppose to watch as a viewer. Marc Rocco's Direction is up-to the mark. He handles the dark, as well as the court-room sequences, with accurate understanding. But, I would like to point out, that, the film is longer than it should have been. It needed to be trimmed, at least, by 15-20 minutes. Performance-Wise: All the actors are Great. Kevin Bacon is nearly exemplary as the frightened victim, Henri Young. His body language, his expressions , as well as his dialogue delivery, are pitch-perfect. Bacon once again proves his range as an actor! Christian Slater scores big time as the righteous lawyer. Gary Oldman is Fantastic! He's so good as the menace, I actually began to hate him. Oldman, genuinely, delivers one of his finest performances here. William H. Macy is perfect, like always. Others lend the required support. On the whole, 'Murder in the First' is not the faint-hearted, as it's too intense & depressing at times. But, it's definitely worth a watch for those, who like watching films, that are written & executed without inhibitions. From this writer, Thumbs Up!

    "Murder in the First" struck me as not a bad movie, but not one that I'd care to watch again. The performances are very good and there are no severe problems with the movie. What I felt in watching it is that it was too long and dragged out. At times I thought it was overdone and exaggerated. Courtroom movies have a tendency to bog down or present unrealistic views of how a trial goes. The movie became a heavy-handed indictment of Alcatraz and the penal system, which they entirely deserve, but the method was still too crude to be really effective. The movie story is realistic in a number of important details. But the man on trial was embellished and altered in many ways that detracted. The fictional characterizations felt concocted and unreal, Hollywoodized. So, overall, it was a bit of a slog through it.

    Murder in the First, is a very powerful courtroom/prison drama that features exemplary acting from all three leads. It's a shame a January release hindered this film's award chances. Plus, I'm shocked not many people heard of this great film. Even though this film is not historically accurate, it's still an engaging film with three of the finest performances you will see. Marc Rocco's film is loosely based on Henri Young and his time at Alcatraz. After Young is transferred to the prison with his only crime stealing five dollars to feed his sister, he is inhumanely treated by the associate warden thus leading to a murder. But a young defense lawyer comes to his aid to lessen his charge against him and to prove to the world what a terrible place Alcatraz is. The acting is magnificent to say the least. Kevin Bacon delivers one of his best performances of his career and he shows a wide acting range playing Henri who lacks trust after spending three years in complete darkness. Christian Slater does mighty fine as the lawyer and Gary Oldman, as usual, delivers another impressive performance. Overall, this film is very interesting and it's an emotionally powerful movie. Some of the scenes really moved me especially the one when we find out some hard, cold facts involving the head warden in the courtroom scene. Like most others, I was disappointed when I learned many facts were muddled but still made audience believe the events in the film were true. That being said, I really liked this movie and I find it to be criminally underrated. I rate this film 9/10.

    This is a great movie that, for some reason, no one has seen. I recently bought it because I am a big fan of Kevin Bacon, and I was completely amazed by his performance. The fact that he wasn't even nominated for an academy award shows you what a joke they are. All the actors are great, especially Bacon and Gary Oldman. The story is pretty good, and the movie is never boring, but the highlight of the film is Bacon's haunting portrayal of a man forced into solitary for three years. He manages to be both creepy and touching, which is amazing. There is some violence in the movie, so if you are not a fan of that, you might not want to watch. Other than that, however, I give a strong recommendation to fans of prison and courtroom movies, as this film contains some compelling elements of both. Overall - 8/10

    It is often interesting how when old movies show up On Demand years after their first release there is a waterfall of response from viewers - almost like the film has been resurrected and given a second life. Such is the case for this 1995 film MURDER IN THE FIRST - there seems to be a more honest evaluation of the film as a film than when it was first released and the public took exception to the 'veracity' of the allegedly true story. According to the reported facts, 'Henri Theodore Young (born 1918) was a prisoner at Alcatraz who attempted to escape with four other inmates, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, William Martin, and Rufus McCain. Young became a bank robber and was known for aggressively taking hostages. In 1933, he committed murder. After spending time in prisons in Washington state and Montana, he was sent to the federal prison on Alcatraz Island. On the night of January 13, 1939, Young, with prisoners Rufus McCain, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, and William Martin, attempted to escape. Martin, Young, and McCain surrendered, while Barker and Stamphill refused to surrender and were subsequently shot. Barker eventually died from his injuries. Allegedly, Young and McCain were sentenced to long terms each in solitary confinement, but they were back in the prison's general population within months. A year later, Young killed Rufus McCain by plunging a spoon into his neck; he never revealed his motive.' Those are the 'facts' upon which this film was based, but in the film the sequence is different. The film plot follows: Henri Young (Kevin Bacon) stole five dollars from a post office and ended up going to prison - to the most famous, or infamous, prison of them all: Alcatraz. He tried to escape, failed, and spent three years and two months in solitary confinement - in a dungeon, with no light, no heat and no toilet. Milton Glenn (Gary Oldman), the assistant warden, who was given free reign by his duty-shirking superior, was responsible for Young's treatment. Glenn even took a straight razor and hobbled Young for life. After three years and two months, Young was taken out of solitary confinement and put with the rest of the prisoners. Almost immediately, Young took a spoon and stabbed a fellow prisoner in the neck, killing him. Now, Young is on trial for murder, and if he's convicted he'll go to the gas chamber. An eager and idealistic young attorney, James Stamphill (Christian Slater), is given this impossible case, and argues before a shocked courtroom that Young had a co-conspirator. The true murderer, he says, was Alcatraz. Mark Rocco directed from the screenplay written by Dan Gordon and the film was photographed by Fred Murphy, the tense musical scoring is by Christopher Young. The story is tight and made credible by the extraordinarily fine performances of Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman and a supporting cast that includes Embeth Davidtz, Kyra Sedgwick, Mia Kirshner, William H. Macy, R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Brad Dourif. This is more a character study than reportage of an historical incident and as such the movie succeeds on every level. Grady Harp

    Just happened upon this movie the other night & decided to tape it as I couldn't watch on TNT's schedule. How I missed this movie 17 years ago I'll never know. This is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen! Not only was Kevin Bacon FANTASTIC, Christian Slater GREAT!!! I've never been a big Gary Oldman fan he was also EXCELLENT. I was riveted to my chair throughout the entire movie; wish I'd seen it years ago when it first came out. I grew up in the Bay Area and the scenery indoors and out were spot on! They truly did a great job on this movie.

    Murder in the First is directed by Marc Rocco and written by Dan Gordon. It stars Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman, Embeth Davidtz, William H. Macy and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Christopher Young and cinematography by Fred Murphy. Slater stars as James Stamphill, an idealistic young attorney who is tasked with defending Alcatraz prisoner Henri Young (Bacon) who clearly murdered a fellow inmate. But what transpires is that Henri had just spent over three years in solitary confinement for attempting to escape the prison. It's evident, also, that Henri has been the subject of systematic violence perpetrated by sadistic Warden Milton Glenn (Oldman). Stamphill risks his career, and Henri's life, to put Alcatraz and the people in charge on trial. Inspired by a true story, viewers should note that this is mostly a fictitious film. The truths are readily available on line so I will not waste space divulging the facts here. Suffice to say that Murder in the First is to be judged solely as a work of fiction. But what a film we get, a heart yanking, emotionally upsetting picture showcasing the evil that men do, filling out the narrative with alienation, cruelty, corruption and revenge driven murder. The dehumanising effects of prison abuse has never been so touchingly portrayed as it is here by Bacon, it's a haunting and vivid portrayal of a man pushed to the limits of sanity, a guy living in the dark recess of hell, struggling with every breath to come out into the light. An astonishing performance that once again in Bacon's career was ignored by his Academy peers. Whilst high on emotional wallop, and some scenes really are tough to watch, the film falls shy of brilliance on account of standard fare for the courtroom sequences. Nothing bad but there's a dramatic thrust missing, and it's not Slater's fault, who is good at being sincere and humanist, the script doesn't provide enough thunder in the trial, in fact often it's too low key for its own good. We get a great snippet of what we are missing as Oldman (another great turn as a angry bastard) loses his cool, but more stomping, shouting and legal soul picking was needed. Tech credits are very good. Rocco has a good sense of claustrophobic atmosphere, the scenes in the bowels of the prison perfectly portray Young's disorientation, the dank, dark and wet surroundings in keeping with the prisoner's state of mind. The director also favours an impressive roving camera technique that serves the story well. He also slots in a couple of noirish reflection scenes, one sees Glenn lose his cool while shaving and smash the mirror, the result is a distorted reflection, a showing of a fractured psyche. The other sees a prison visit between Stamphill and Young separated by a piece of glass, their respective reflections at first coming off as grotesque, but then slowly blending into one, a sign that maybe lawyer and prisoner will eventually sing from the same song sheet? It's a film that has found its way on to some neo-noir lists, visually and thematically as regards Bacon's character, that is fair enough. Elsewhere.

Marc Rocco's film is loosely based on Henri Young and his time at Alcatraz. After Young is transferred to the prison with his only crime stealing five dollars to feed his sister, he is inhumanely treated by the associate warden thus leading to a murder. But a young defense lawyer comes to his aid to lessen his charge against him and to prove to the world what a terrible place Alcatraz is. The acting is magnificent to say the least. Kevin Bacon delivers one of his best performances of his career and he shows a wide acting range playing Henri who lacks trust after spending three years in complete darkness. Christian Slater does mighty fine as the lawyer and Gary Oldman, as usual, delivers another impressive performance. Overall, this film is very interesting and it's an emotionally powerful movie. Some of the scenes really moved me especially the one when we find out some hard, cold facts involving the head warden in the courtroom scene. Like most others, I was disappointed when I learned many facts were muddled but still made audience believe the events in the film were true. That being said, I really liked this movie and I find it to be criminally underrated. I rate this film 9/10.

    This is a great movie that, for some reason, no one has seen. I recently bought it because I am a big fan of Kevin Bacon, and I was completely amazed by his performance. The fact that he wasn't even nominated for an academy award shows you what a joke they are. All the actors are great, especially Bacon and Gary Oldman. The story is pretty good, and the movie is never boring, but the highlight of the film is Bacon's haunting portrayal of a man forced into solitary for three years. He manages to be both creepy and touching, which is amazing. There is some violence in the movie, so if you are not a fan of that, you might not want to watch. Other than that, however, I give a strong recommendation to fans of prison and courtroom movies, as this film contains some compelling elements of both. Overall - 8/10

    It is often interesting how when old movies show up On Demand years after their first release there is a waterfall of response from viewers - almost like the film has been resurrected and given a second life. Such is the case for this 1995 film MURDER IN THE FIRST - there seems to be a more honest evaluation of the film as a film than when it was first released and the public took exception to the 'veracity' of the allegedly true story. According to the reported facts, 'Henri Theodore Young (born 1918) was a prisoner at Alcatraz who attempted to escape with four other inmates, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, William Martin, and Rufus McCain. Young became a bank robber and was known for aggressively taking hostages. In 1933, he committed murder. After spending time in prisons in Washington state and Montana, he was sent to the federal prison on Alcatraz Island. On the night of January 13, 1939, Young, with prisoners Rufus McCain, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, and William Martin, attempted to escape. Martin, Young, and McCain surrendered, while Barker and Stamphill refused to surrender and were subsequently shot. Barker eventually died from his injuries. Allegedly, Young and McCain were sentenced to long terms each in solitary confinement, but they were back in the prison's general population within months. A year later, Young killed Rufus McCain by plunging a spoon into his neck; he never revealed his motive.' Those are the 'facts' upon which this film was based, but in the film the sequence is different. The film plot follows: Henri Young (Kevin Bacon) stole five dollars from a post office and ended up going to prison - to the most famous, or infamous, prison of them all: Alcatraz. He tried to escape, failed, and spent three years and two months in solitary confinement - in a dungeon, with no light, no heat and no toilet. Milton Glenn (Gary Oldman), the assistant warden, who was given free reign by his duty-shirking superior, was responsible for Young's treatment. Glenn even took a straight razor and hobbled Young for life. After three years and two months, Young was taken out of solitary confinement and put with the rest of the prisoners. Almost immediately, Young took a spoon and stabbed a fellow prisoner in the neck, killing him. Now, Young is on trial for murder, and if he's convicted he'll go to the gas chamber. An eager and idealistic young attorney, James Stamphill (Christian Slater), is given this impossible case, and argues before a shocked courtroom that Young had a co-conspirator. The true murderer, he says, was Alcatraz. Mark Rocco directed from the screenplay written by Dan Gordon and the film was photographed by Fred Murphy, the tense musical scoring is by Christopher Young. The story is tight and made credible by the extraordinarily fine performances of Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman and a supporting cast that includes Embeth Davidtz, Kyra Sedgwick, Mia Kirshner, William H. Macy, R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Brad Dourif. This is more a character study than reportage of an historical incident and as such the movie succeeds on every level. Grady Harp

    Just happened upon this movie the other night & decided to tape it as I couldn't watch on TNT's schedule. How I missed this movie 17 years ago I'll never know. This is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen! Not only was Kevin Bacon FANTASTIC, Christian Slater GREAT!!! I've never been a big Gary Oldman fan he was also EXCELLENT. I was riveted to my chair throughout the entire movie; wish I'd seen it years ago when it first came out. I grew up in the Bay Area and the scenery indoors and out were spot on! They truly did a great job on this movie.

    Murder in the First is directed by Marc Rocco and written by Dan Gordon. It stars Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman, Embeth Davidtz, William H. Macy and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Christopher Young and cinematography by Fred Murphy. Slater stars as James Stamphill, an idealistic young attorney who is tasked with defending Alcatraz prisoner Henri Young (Bacon) who clearly murdered a fellow inmate. But what transpires is that Henri had just spent over three years in solitary confinement for attempting to escape the prison. It's evident, also, that Henri has been the subject of systematic violence perpetrated by sadistic Warden Milton Glenn (Oldman). Stamphill risks his career, and Henri's life, to put Alcatraz and the people in charge on trial. Inspired by a true story, viewers should note that this is mostly a fictitious film. The truths are readily available on line so I will not waste space divulging the facts here. Suffice to say that Murder in the First is to be judged solely as a work of fiction. But what a film we get, a heart yanking, emotionally upsetting picture showcasing the evil that men do, filling out the narrative with alienation, cruelty, corruption and revenge driven murder. The dehumanising effects of prison abuse has never been so touchingly portrayed as it is here by Bacon, it's a haunting and vivid portrayal of a man pushed to the limits of sanity, a guy living in the dark recess of hell, struggling with every breath to come out into the light. An astonishing performance that once again in Bacon's career was ignored by his Academy peers. Whilst high on emotional wallop, and some scenes really are tough to watch, the film falls shy of brilliance on account of standard fare for the courtroom sequences. Nothing bad but there's a dramatic thrust missing, and it's not Slater's fault, who is good at being sincere and humanist, the script doesn't provide enough thunder in the trial, in fact often it's too low key for its own good. We get a great snippet of what we are missing as Oldman (another great turn as a angry bastard) loses his cool, but more stomping, shouting and legal soul picking was needed. Tech credits are very good. Rocco has a good sense of claustrophobic atmosphere, the scenes in the bowels of the prison perfectly portray Young's disorientation, the dank, dark and wet surroundings in keeping with the prisoner's state of mind. The director also favours an impressive roving camera technique that serves the story well. He also slots in a couple of noirish reflection scenes, one sees Glenn lose his cool while shaving and smash the mirror, the result is a distorted reflection, a showing of a fractured psyche. The other sees a prison visit between Stamphill and Young separated by a piece of glass, their respective reflections at first coming off as grotesque, but then slowly blending into one, a sign that maybe lawyer and prisoner will eventually sing from the same song sheet? It's a film that has found its way on to some neo-noir lists, visually and thematically as regards Bacon's character, that is fair enough. Elsewhere. Murphy's photography is a key component to the tonal flow of the story, while Young's score is a real treat, criminally forgotten it relies on strings and choir for emotive means and succeeds exceptionally well. In support Macy and Davidtz do well with thinly written parts, but Ermey is a joy as the blunderbuss judge presiding over the trial. Nice to see Brad Dourif in the mix as well, even if we ultimately hanker for more of this great character actor. In a year that saw high end emotional drama released with Dead Man Walking and Leaving Las Vegas, Murder in the First sadly had some of its thunder stolen. Which coupled with the fact many refused to accept it fictionalising the Henri Young/Alcatraz story, saw it slip away until the World went internet crazy and it got rediscovered. It deserves to be found still some more, so seek it out film fans. 8/10

    Just about every factual detail of this film is a complete lie, right down to the spelling of Henry Young's name (Henri was an alias of this habitual bank robber and murderer). The whole film is just a high-handed defamation of the U.S. penal system, which did not warrant any such besmirching. I'm surprised that R. Lee Ermey was a part of this film. He probably regrets it by now. The real Henri Young jumped parole in 1972, was last seen in Washington State, and may still be alive and at large today with at least two known homicides to his credit. He was not a non-violent offender at the time he came to Alcatraz, he was serving a sentence for murder and bank robbery! He did not spend 3 years or even three months in solitary after the escape attempt, and murdered McCain over a year after rejoining the general prison population. His solitary time was done in a normal holding cell in the main cell block, with normal lighting, exercise, medical attention, and food supplies throughout the entire period. DO NOT GET YOUR HISTORY FROM Hollywood! They spin sentimentalist lies at every possible opportunity. Check out the facts on "Birdman of Alcatraz" and "Awakenings" for two more infamous pack of lies.

    Kevin Bacon was incredible. See he won for his performance. But so should Christian Slater have. So should the cinematographer. Unique, inventive and incredibly creative camera perspectives. Wonderful historic background interspersed, too. Superlative effort all around. every facet of it. Scenes I glanced away from, but that's just my distaste for depiction of violence. Thought it was tenderly beautiful that Kyra Sedgewick was cast in that cameo, since Bacon is her real life husband. Slater cannot act poorly. He's incapable of it. Everything about it, to say nothing of the theme itself. The lighting, the cryptic cutting every time the point was made without fail, the lingering closeups when humanity was the point.

    Directed by Marc Rocco, Murder In The First (based very loosely on a true story), tells the tale of Alcatraz inmate Henri Young (Bacon) and his treatment at the hands of the Associate Warden and Alcatraz authorities, which subsequently lead to the catastrophic events that set the film in motion. The period is set in the late 1930's. Petty thief Henri Young, played by Kevin Bacon, was sent to Alcatraz previously from another prison to make up the numbers as the infamous Rock was lacking incorrigibles at the time and the numbers needed justification. He and a small party of other prisoners attempt a daring escape which inevitably fails. One of the escapees, Rufus McCain cuts a deal with the Associate Warden Glenn (Gary Oldman) and is rewarded by being sent back to the general prison population. Henri Young is not so lucky and is sent to the dungeons of Alcatraz, commonly referred to as 'The Hole', where he spends a total of 3 years and 2 months in complete solitude, with no light, clothing, toilet or other basic provisions. We then witness Young's gradual descent into insanity as he is cut off from human contact and suffers merciless torture and beatings at the hands of the Warden and the guards there. Young emerges a mere shell of his former self, and almost immediately kills another inmate in the prison canteen. The rest of the movie is focused on the subsequent court case whereby Henri is defended by a young and inexperienced, albeit enthusiastic lawyer James Stamphill, played by Christian Slater. Stamphill attempts to put Alcatraz and it's wardens on trial and expose the conditions there. The movie is a solid one and is gripping enough to keep you watching. Christian Slater's narration leads us through the movie and events. Kevin Bacon is excellent and very convincing as the prisoner making us believe every word and scene. He plays Henri Young as a pathetic, ruined man who is totally at the mercy of Alcatraz. Gary Oldman is great in a supporting role here, playing a sadistic warden almost in a monstrous bureaucratic way. He is given free reign to do what he does in the film and of course Oldman is at his best when playing borderline psychos with underlying anger issues just waiting to boil up. I only wish his character could have been given a little more screen time. Christian Slater is good as the lawyer and is suited for this part. I am often undecided in my opinion of Christian Slater when I watch him, but I feel that in this movie he does what is needed and plays Stamphill as a decent guy who is fundamentally a humanist. Some scenes are brutal and hard to watch, especially the torture scenes in the dungeons where Bacons's character suffers. Some viewers may actually consider this a movie that requires only the one watch, as it kind of leaves a dark impression on the mind. But this is how it was intended to be made. It's not pretending to be anything else. This is undoubtedly a very moving and powerful film that won't disappoint. If you like strong and solid performances then look no further.

    Though A Largely Fictitious Film, about petty criminal Henri Young, 'Murder in the First', yet comes across as a convincing cinematic experience. Though depressing and hard to stomach, the honesty it's been made and it's hallmark performances, manage to hold your interest. 'Murder in the First' is a about a petty criminal named Henri Young, played by Kevin Bacon, who is put on trial for murder in the first degree. But, a righteous recent law school graduate, played by Christian Slater, takes up the challenge to take up Young's case, and later blames the prison's executives, for the brutal murder committed by Young. 'Murder in the First', like mentioned before, is a largely fictitious take on Henri Young's life. But, cinematically, Henri Young comes across as a frightened victim, who was physically & mentally abused by the Prison's executives. You, in fact, support him here and you sympathize with him all through, and you literally begin to hate the prison's executives. The depiction of Young being in a solitary confinement, and knowing his suffering, shakes you and leaves you numb. 'Murder in the First' is an honest film. Dan Gordon's Writing is hard-hitting & on your-face. The Writer hasn't shy-ed away by not showing what your suppose to watch as a viewer. Marc Rocco's Direction is up-to the mark. He handles the dark, as well as the court-room sequences, with accurate understanding. But, I would like to point out, that, the film is longer than it should have been. It needed to be trimmed, at least, by 15-20 minutes. Performance-Wise: All the actors are Great. Kevin Bacon is nearly exemplary as the frightened victim, Henri Young. His body language, his expressions , as well as his dialogue delivery, are pitch-perfect. Bacon once again proves his range as an actor! Christian Slater scores big time as the righteous lawyer. Gary Oldman is Fantastic! He's so good as the menace, I actually began to hate him. Oldman, genuinely, delivers one of his finest performances here. William H. Macy is perfect, like always. Others lend the required support. On the whole, 'Murder in the First' is not the faint-hearted, as it's too intense & depressing at times. But, it's definitely worth a watch for those, who like watching films, that are written & executed without inhibitions. From this writer, Thumbs Up!

    "Murder in the First" struck me as not a bad movie, but not one that I'd care to watch again. The performances are very good and there are no severe problems with the movie. What I felt in watching it is that it was too long and dragged out. At times I thought it was overdone and exaggerated. Courtroom movies have a tendency to bog down or present unrealistic views of how a trial goes. The movie became a heavy-handed indictment of Alcatraz and the penal system, which they entirely deserve, but the method was still too crude to be really effective. The movie story is realistic in a number of important details. But the man on trial was embellished and altered in many ways that detracted. The fictional characterizations felt concocted and unreal, Hollywoodized. So, overall, it was a bit of a slog through it.

The real Henri Young jumped parole in 1972, was last seen in Washington State, and may still be alive and at large today with at least two known homicides to his credit. He was not a non-violent offender at the time he came to Alcatraz, he was serving a sentence for murder and bank robbery! He did not spend 3 years or even three months in solitary after the escape attempt, and murdered McCain over a year after rejoining the general prison population. His solitary time was done in a normal holding cell in the main cell block, with normal lighting, exercise, medical attention, and food supplies throughout the entire period. DO NOT GET YOUR HISTORY FROM Hollywood! They spin sentimentalist lies at every possible opportunity. Check out the facts on "Birdman of Alcatraz" and "Awakenings" for two more infamous pack of lies.

    Kevin Bacon was incredible. See he won for his performance. But so should Christian Slater have. So should the cinematographer. Unique, inventive and incredibly creative camera perspectives. Wonderful historic background interspersed, too. Superlative effort all around. every facet of it. Scenes I glanced away from, but that's just my distaste for depiction of violence. Thought it was tenderly beautiful that Kyra Sedgewick was cast in that cameo, since Bacon is her real life husband. Slater cannot act poorly. He's incapable of it. Everything about it, to say nothing of the theme itself. The lighting, the cryptic cutting every time the point was made without fail, the lingering closeups when humanity was the point.

    Directed by Marc Rocco, Murder In The First (based very loosely on a true story), tells the tale of Alcatraz inmate Henri Young (Bacon) and his treatment at the hands of the Associate Warden and Alcatraz authorities, which subsequently lead to the catastrophic events that set the film in motion. The period is set in the late 1930's. Petty thief Henri Young, played by Kevin Bacon, was sent to Alcatraz previously from another prison to make up the numbers as the infamous Rock was lacking incorrigibles at the time and the numbers needed justification. He and a small party of other prisoners attempt a daring escape which inevitably fails. One of the escapees, Rufus McCain cuts a deal with the Associate Warden Glenn (Gary Oldman) and is rewarded by being sent back to the general prison population. Henri Young is not so lucky and is sent to the dungeons of Alcatraz, commonly referred to as 'The Hole', where he spends a total of 3 years and 2 months in complete solitude, with no light, clothing, toilet or other basic provisions. We then witness Young's gradual descent into insanity as he is cut off from human contact and suffers merciless torture and beatings at the hands of the Warden and the guards there. Young emerges a mere shell of his former self, and almost immediately kills another inmate in the prison canteen. The rest of the movie is focused on the subsequent court case whereby Henri is defended by a young and inexperienced, albeit enthusiastic lawyer James Stamphill, played by Christian Slater. Stamphill attempts to put Alcatraz and it's wardens on trial and expose the conditions there. The movie is a solid one and is gripping enough to keep you watching. Christian Slater's narration leads us through the movie and events. Kevin Bacon is excellent and very convincing as the prisoner making us believe every word and scene. He plays Henri Young as a pathetic, ruined man who is totally at the mercy of Alcatraz. Gary Oldman is great in a supporting role here, playing a sadistic warden almost in a monstrous bureaucratic way. He is given free reign to do what he does in the film and of course Oldman is at his best when playing borderline psychos with underlying anger issues just waiting to boil up. I only wish his character could have been given a little more screen time. Christian Slater is good as the lawyer and is suited for this part. I am often undecided in my opinion of Christian Slater when I watch him, but I feel that in this movie he does what is needed and plays Stamphill as a decent guy who is fundamentally a humanist. Some scenes are brutal and hard to watch, especially the torture scenes in the dungeons where Bacons's character suffers. Some viewers may actually consider this a movie that requires only the one watch, as it kind of leaves a dark impression on the mind. But this is how it was intended to be made. It's not pretending to be anything else. This is undoubtedly a very moving and powerful film that won't disappoint. If you like strong and solid performances then look no further.

    Though A Largely Fictitious Film, about petty criminal Henri Young, 'Murder in the First', yet comes across as a convincing cinematic experience. Though depressing and hard to stomach, the honesty it's been made and it's hallmark performances, manage to hold your interest. 'Murder in the First' is a about a petty criminal named Henri Young, played by Kevin Bacon, who is put on trial for murder in the first degree. But, a righteous recent law school graduate, played by Christian Slater, takes up the challenge to take up Young's case, and later blames the prison's executives, for the brutal murder committed by Young. 'Murder in the First', like mentioned before, is a largely fictitious take on Henri Young's life. But, cinematically, Henri Young comes across as a frightened victim, who was physically & mentally abused by the Prison's executives. You, in fact, support him here and you sympathize with him all through, and you literally begin to hate the prison's executives. The depiction of Young being in a solitary confinement, and knowing his suffering, shakes you and leaves you numb. 'Murder in the First' is an honest film. Dan Gordon's Writing is hard-hitting & on your-face. The Writer hasn't shy-ed away by not showing what your suppose to watch as a viewer. Marc Rocco's Direction is up-to the mark. He handles the dark, as well as the court-room sequences, with accurate understanding. But, I would like to point out, that, the film is longer than it should have been. It needed to be trimmed, at least, by 15-20 minutes. Performance-Wise: All the actors are Great. Kevin Bacon is nearly exemplary as the frightened victim, Henri Young. His body language, his expressions , as well as his dialogue delivery, are pitch-perfect. Bacon once again proves his range as an actor! Christian Slater scores big time as the righteous lawyer. Gary Oldman is Fantastic! He's so good as the menace, I actually began to hate him. Oldman, genuinely, delivers one of his finest performances here. William H. Macy is perfect, like always. Others lend the required support. On the whole, 'Murder in the First' is not the faint-hearted, as it's too intense & depressing at times. But, it's definitely worth a watch for those, who like watching films, that are written & executed without inhibitions. From this writer, Thumbs Up!

    "Murder in the First" struck me as not a bad movie, but not one that I'd care to watch again. The performances are very good and there are no severe problems with the movie. What I felt in watching it is that it was too long and dragged out. At times I thought it was overdone and exaggerated. Courtroom movies have a tendency to bog down or present unrealistic views of how a trial goes. The movie became a heavy-handed indictment of Alcatraz and the penal system, which they entirely deserve, but the method was still too crude to be really effective. The movie story is realistic in a number of important details. But the man on trial was embellished and altered in many ways that detracted. The fictional characterizations felt concocted and unreal, Hollywoodized. So, overall, it was a bit of a slog through it.

    Murder in the First, is a very powerful courtroom/prison drama that features exemplary acting from all three leads. It's a shame a January release hindered this film's award chances. Plus, I'm shocked not many people heard of this great film. Even though this film is not historically accurate, it's still an engaging film with three of the finest performances you will see. Marc Rocco's film is loosely based on Henri Young and his time at Alcatraz. After Young is transferred to the prison with his only crime stealing five dollars to feed his sister, he is inhumanely treated by the associate warden thus leading to a murder. But a young defense lawyer comes to his aid to lessen his charge against him and to prove to the world what a terrible place Alcatraz is. The acting is magnificent to say the least. Kevin Bacon delivers one of his best performances of his career and he shows a wide acting range playing Henri who lacks trust after spending three years in complete darkness. Christian Slater does mighty fine as the lawyer and Gary Oldman, as usual, delivers another impressive performance. Overall, this film is very interesting and it's an emotionally powerful movie. Some of the scenes really moved me especially the one when we find out some hard, cold facts involving the head warden in the courtroom scene. Like most others, I was disappointed when I learned many facts were muddled but still made audience believe the events in the film were true. That being said, I really liked this movie and I find it to be criminally underrated. I rate this film 9/10.

    This is a great movie that, for some reason, no one has seen. I recently bought it because I am a big fan of Kevin Bacon, and I was completely amazed by his performance. The fact that he wasn't even nominated for an academy award shows you what a joke they are. All the actors are great, especially Bacon and Gary Oldman. The story is pretty good, and the movie is never boring, but the highlight of the film is Bacon's haunting portrayal of a man forced into solitary for three years. He manages to be both creepy and touching, which is amazing. There is some violence in the movie, so if you are not a fan of that, you might not want to watch. Other than that, however, I give a strong recommendation to fans of prison and courtroom movies, as this film contains some compelling elements of both. Overall - 8/10

    It is often interesting how when old movies show up On Demand years after their first release there is a waterfall of response from viewers - almost like the film has been resurrected and given a second life. Such is the case for this 1995 film MURDER IN THE FIRST - there seems to be a more honest evaluation of the film as a film than when it was first released and the public took exception to the 'veracity' of the allegedly true story. According to the reported facts, 'Henri Theodore Young (born 1918) was a prisoner at Alcatraz who attempted to escape with four other inmates, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, William Martin, and Rufus McCain. Young became a bank robber and was known for aggressively taking hostages. In 1933, he committed murder. After spending time in prisons in Washington state and Montana, he was sent to the federal prison on Alcatraz Island. On the night of January 13, 1939, Young, with prisoners Rufus McCain, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, and William Martin, attempted to escape. Martin, Young, and McCain surrendered, while Barker and Stamphill refused to surrender and were subsequently shot. Barker eventually died from his injuries. Allegedly, Young and McCain were sentenced to long terms each in solitary confinement, but they were back in the prison's general population within months. A year later, Young killed Rufus McCain by plunging a spoon into his neck; he never revealed his motive.' Those are the 'facts' upon which this film was based, but in the film the sequence is different. The film plot follows: Henri Young (Kevin Bacon) stole five dollars from a post office and ended up going to prison - to the most famous, or infamous, prison of them all: Alcatraz. He tried to escape, failed, and spent three years and two months in solitary confinement - in a dungeon, with no light, no heat and no toilet. Milton Glenn (Gary Oldman), the assistant warden, who was given free reign by his duty-shirking superior, was responsible for Young's treatment. Glenn even took a straight razor and hobbled Young for life. After three years and two months, Young was taken out of solitary confinement and put with the rest of the prisoners. Almost immediately, Young took a spoon and stabbed a fellow prisoner in the neck, killing him. Now, Young is on trial for murder, and if he's convicted he'll go to the gas chamber. An eager and idealistic young attorney, James Stamphill (Christian Slater), is given this impossible case, and argues before a shocked courtroom that Young had a co-conspirator. The true murderer, he says, was Alcatraz. Mark Rocco directed from the screenplay written by Dan Gordon and the film was photographed by Fred Murphy, the tense musical scoring is by Christopher Young. The story is tight and made credible by the extraordinarily fine performances of Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman and a supporting cast that includes Embeth Davidtz, Kyra Sedgwick, Mia Kirshner, William H. Macy, R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Brad Dourif. This is more a character study than reportage of an historical incident and as such the movie succeeds on every level. Grady Harp

    Just happened upon this movie the other night & decided to tape it as I couldn't watch on TNT's schedule. How I missed this movie 17 years ago I'll never know. This is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen! Not only was Kevin Bacon FANTASTIC, Christian Slater GREAT!!! I've never been a big Gary Oldman fan he was also EXCELLENT. I was riveted to my chair throughout the entire movie; wish I'd seen it years ago when it first came out. I grew up in the Bay Area and the scenery indoors and out were spot on! They truly did a great job on this movie.

    Murder in the First is directed by Marc Rocco and written by Dan Gordon. It stars Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman, Embeth Davidtz, William H. Macy and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Christopher Young and cinematography by Fred Murphy. Slater stars as James Stamphill, an idealistic young attorney who is tasked with defending Alcatraz prisoner Henri Young (Bacon) who clearly murdered a fellow inmate. But what transpires is that Henri had just spent over three years in solitary confinement for attempting to escape the prison. It's evident, also, that Henri has been the subject of systematic violence perpetrated by sadistic Warden Milton Glenn (Oldman). Stamphill risks his career, and Henri's life, to put Alcatraz and the people in charge on trial. Inspired by a true story, viewers should note that this is mostly a fictitious film. The truths are readily available on line so I will not waste space divulging the facts here. Suffice to say that Murder in the First is to be judged solely as a work of fiction. But what a film we get, a heart yanking, emotionally upsetting picture showcasing the evil that men do, filling out the narrative with alienation, cruelty, corruption and revenge driven murder. The dehumanising effects of prison abuse has never been so touchingly portrayed as it is here by Bacon, it's a haunting and vivid portrayal of a man pushed to the limits of sanity, a guy living in the dark recess of hell, struggling with every breath to come out into the light. An astonishing performance that once again in Bacon's career was ignored by his Academy peers. Whilst high on emotional wallop, and some scenes really are tough to watch, the film falls shy of brilliance on account of standard fare for the courtroom sequences. Nothing bad but there's a dramatic thrust missing, and it's not Slater's fault, who is good at being sincere and humanist, the script doesn't provide enough thunder in the trial, in fact often it's too low key for its own good. We get a great snippet of what we are missing as Oldman (another great turn as a angry bastard) loses his cool, but more stomping, shouting and legal soul picking was needed. Tech credits are very good. Rocco has a good sense of claustrophobic atmosphere, the scenes in the bowels of the prison perfectly portray Young's disorientation, the dank, dark and wet surroundings in keeping with the prisoner's state of mind. The director also favours an impressive roving camera technique that serves the story well. He also slots in a couple of noirish reflection scenes, one sees Glenn lose his cool while shaving and smash the mirror, the result is a distorted reflection, a showing of a fractured psyche. The other sees a prison visit between Stamphill and Young separated by a piece of glass, their respective reflections at first coming off as grotesque, but then slowly blending into one, a sign that maybe lawyer and prisoner will eventually sing from the same song sheet? It's a film that has found its way on to some neo-noir lists, visually and thematically as regards Bacon's character, that is fair enough. Elsewhere. Murphy's photography is a key component to the tonal flow of the story, while Young's score is a real treat, criminally forgotten it relies on strings and choir for emotive means and succeeds exceptionally well. In support Macy and Davidtz do well with thinly written parts, but Ermey is a joy as the blunderbuss judge presiding over the trial. Nice to see Brad Dourif in the mix as well, even if we ultimately hanker for more of this great character actor. In a year that saw high end emotional drama released with Dead Man Walking and Leaving Las Vegas, Murder in the First sadly had some of its thunder stolen. Which coupled with the fact many refused to accept it fictionalising the Henri Young/Alcatraz story, saw it slip away until the World went internet crazy and it got rediscovered. It deserves to be found still some more, so seek it out film fans. 8/10

    Just about every factual detail of this film is a complete lie, right down to the spelling of Henry Young's name (Henri was an alias of this habitual bank robber and murderer). The whole film is just a high-handed defamation of the U.S. penal system, which did not warrant any such besmirching. I'm surprised that R. Lee Ermey was a part of this film. He probably regrets it by now. The real Henri Young jumped parole in 1972, was last seen in Washington State, and may still be alive and at large today with at least two known homicides to his credit.

Other than that, however, I give a strong recommendation to fans of prison and courtroom movies, as this film contains some compelling elements of both. Overall - 8/10

    It is often interesting how when old movies show up On Demand years after their first release there is a waterfall of response from viewers - almost like the film has been resurrected and given a second life. Such is the case for this 1995 film MURDER IN THE FIRST - there seems to be a more honest evaluation of the film as a film than when it was first released and the public took exception to the 'veracity' of the allegedly true story. According to the reported facts, 'Henri Theodore Young (born 1918) was a prisoner at Alcatraz who attempted to escape with four other inmates, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, William Martin, and Rufus McCain. Young became a bank robber and was known for aggressively taking hostages. In 1933, he committed murder. After spending time in prisons in Washington state and Montana, he was sent to the federal prison on Alcatraz Island. On the night of January 13, 1939, Young, with prisoners Rufus McCain, Arthur Barker, Dale Stamphill, and William Martin, attempted to escape. Martin, Young, and McCain surrendered, while Barker and Stamphill refused to surrender and were subsequently shot. Barker eventually died from his injuries. Allegedly, Young and McCain were sentenced to long terms each in solitary confinement, but they were back in the prison's general population within months. A year later, Young killed Rufus McCain by plunging a spoon into his neck; he never revealed his motive.' Those are the 'facts' upon which this film was based, but in the film the sequence is different. The film plot follows: Henri Young (Kevin Bacon) stole five dollars from a post office and ended up going to prison - to the most famous, or infamous, prison of them all: Alcatraz. He tried to escape, failed, and spent three years and two months in solitary confinement - in a dungeon, with no light, no heat and no toilet. Milton Glenn (Gary Oldman), the assistant warden, who was given free reign by his duty-shirking superior, was responsible for Young's treatment. Glenn even took a straight razor and hobbled Young for life. After three years and two months, Young was taken out of solitary confinement and put with the rest of the prisoners. Almost immediately, Young took a spoon and stabbed a fellow prisoner in the neck, killing him. Now, Young is on trial for murder, and if he's convicted he'll go to the gas chamber. An eager and idealistic young attorney, James Stamphill (Christian Slater), is given this impossible case, and argues before a shocked courtroom that Young had a co-conspirator. The true murderer, he says, was Alcatraz. Mark Rocco directed from the screenplay written by Dan Gordon and the film was photographed by Fred Murphy, the tense musical scoring is by Christopher Young. The story is tight and made credible by the extraordinarily fine performances of Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman and a supporting cast that includes Embeth Davidtz, Kyra Sedgwick, Mia Kirshner, William H. Macy, R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Brad Dourif. This is more a character study than reportage of an historical incident and as such the movie succeeds on every level. Grady Harp

    Just happened upon this movie the other night & decided to tape it as I couldn't watch on TNT's schedule. How I missed this movie 17 years ago I'll never know. This is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen! Not only was Kevin Bacon FANTASTIC, Christian Slater GREAT!!! I've never been a big Gary Oldman fan he was also EXCELLENT. I was riveted to my chair throughout the entire movie; wish I'd seen it years ago when it first came out. I grew up in the Bay Area and the scenery indoors and out were spot on! They truly did a great job on this movie.

    Murder in the First is directed by Marc Rocco and written by Dan Gordon. It stars Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman, Embeth Davidtz, William H. Macy and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Christopher Young and cinematography by Fred Murphy. Slater stars as James Stamphill, an idealistic young attorney who is tasked with defending Alcatraz prisoner Henri Young (Bacon) who clearly murdered a fellow inmate. But what transpires is that Henri had just spent over three years in solitary confinement for attempting to escape the prison. It's evident, also, that Henri has been the subject of systematic violence perpetrated by sadistic Warden Milton Glenn (Oldman). Stamphill risks his career, and Henri's life, to put Alcatraz and the people in charge on trial. Inspired by a true story, viewers should note that this is mostly a fictitious film. The truths are readily available on line so I will not waste space divulging the facts here. Suffice to say that Murder in the First is to be judged solely as a work of fiction. But what a film we get, a heart yanking, emotionally upsetting picture showcasing the evil that men do, filling out the narrative with alienation, cruelty, corruption and revenge driven murder. The dehumanising effects of prison abuse has never been so touchingly portrayed as it is here by Bacon, it's a haunting and vivid portrayal of a man pushed to the limits of sanity, a guy living in the dark recess of hell, struggling with every breath to come out into the light. An astonishing performance that once again in Bacon's career was ignored by his Academy peers. Whilst high on emotional wallop, and some scenes really are tough to watch, the film falls shy of brilliance on account of standard fare for the courtroom sequences. Nothing bad but there's a dramatic thrust missing, and it's not Slater's fault, who is good at being sincere and humanist, the script doesn't provide enough thunder in the trial, in fact often it's too low key for its own good. We get a great snippet of what we are missing as Oldman (another great turn as a angry bastard) loses his cool, but more stomping, shouting and legal soul picking was needed. Tech credits are very good. Rocco has a good sense of claustrophobic atmosphere, the scenes in the bowels of the prison perfectly portray Young's disorientation, the dank, dark and wet surroundings in keeping with the prisoner's state of mind. The director also favours an impressive roving camera technique that serves the story well. He also slots in a couple of noirish reflection scenes, one sees Glenn lose his cool while shaving and smash the mirror, the result is a distorted reflection, a showing of a fractured psyche. The other sees a prison visit between Stamphill and Young separated by a piece of glass, their respective reflections at first coming off as grotesque, but then slowly blending into one, a sign that maybe lawyer and prisoner will eventually sing from the same song sheet? It's a film that has found its way on to some neo-noir lists, visually and thematically as regards Bacon's character, that is fair enough. Elsewhere. Murphy's photography is a key component to the tonal flow of the story, while Young's score is a real treat, criminally forgotten it relies on strings and choir for emotive means and succeeds exceptionally well. In support Macy and Davidtz do well with thinly written parts, but Ermey is a joy as the blunderbuss judge presiding over the trial. Nice to see Brad Dourif in the mix as well, even if we ultimately hanker for more of this great character actor. In a year that saw high end emotional drama released with Dead Man Walking and Leaving Las Vegas, Murder in the First sadly had some of its thunder stolen. Which coupled with the fact many refused to accept it fictionalising the Henri Young/Alcatraz story, saw it slip away until the World went internet crazy and it got rediscovered. It deserves to be found still some more, so seek it out film fans. 8/10

    Just about every factual detail of this film is a complete lie, right down to the spelling of Henry Young's name (Henri was an alias of this habitual bank robber and murderer). The whole film is just a high-handed defamation of the U.S. penal system, which did not warrant any such besmirching. I'm surprised that R. Lee Ermey was a part of this film. He probably regrets it by now. The real Henri Young jumped parole in 1972, was last seen in Washington State, and may still be alive and at large today with at least two known homicides to his credit. He was not a non-violent offender at the time he came to Alcatraz, he was serving a sentence for murder and bank robbery! He did not spend 3 years or even three months in solitary after the escape attempt, and murdered McCain over a year after rejoining the general prison population. His solitary time was done in a normal holding cell in the main cell block, with normal lighting, exercise, medical attention, and food supplies throughout the entire period. DO NOT GET YOUR HISTORY FROM Hollywood! They spin sentimentalist lies at every possible opportunity. Check out the facts on "Birdman of Alcatraz" and "Awakenings" for two more infamous pack of lies.

    Kevin Bacon was incredible. See he won for his performance. But so should Christian Slater have. So should the cinematographer. Unique, inventive and incredibly creative camera perspectives. Wonderful historic background interspersed, too. Superlative effort all around. every facet of it. Scenes I glanced away from, but that's just my distaste for depiction of violence. Thought it was tenderly beautiful that Kyra Sedgewick was cast in that cameo, since Bacon is her real life husband. Slater cannot act poorly. He's incapable of it. Everything about it, to say nothing of the theme itself. The lighting, the cryptic cutting every time the point was made without fail, the lingering closeups when humanity was the point.

    Directed by Marc Rocco, Murder In The First (based very loosely on a true story), tells the tale of Alcatraz inmate Henri Young (Bacon) and his treatment at the hands of the Associate Warden and Alcatraz authorities, which subsequently lead to the catastrophic events that set the film in motion. The period is set in the late 1930's. Petty thief Henri Young, played by Kevin Bacon, was sent to Alcatraz previously from another prison to make up the numbers as the infamous Rock was lacking incorrigibles at the time and the numbers needed justification. He and a small party of other prisoners attempt a daring escape which inevitably fails. One of the escapees, Rufus McCain cuts a deal with the Associate Warden Glenn (Gary Oldman) and is rewarded by being sent back to the general prison population. Henri Young is not so lucky and is sent to the dungeons of Alcatraz, commonly referred to as 'The Hole', where he spends a total of 3 years and 2 months in complete solitude, with no light, clothing, toilet or other basic provisions. We then witness Young's gradual descent into insanity as he is cut off from human contact and suffers merciless torture and beatings at the hands of the Warden and the guards there. Young emerges a mere shell of his former self, and almost immediately kills another inmate in the prison canteen. The rest of the movie is focused on the subsequent court case whereby Henri is defended by a young and inexperienced, albeit enthusiastic lawyer James Stamphill, played by Christian Slater. Stamphill attempts to put Alcatraz and it's wardens on trial and expose the conditions there. The movie is a solid one and is gripping enough to keep you watching. Christian Slater's narration leads us through the movie and events. Kevin Bacon is excellent and very convincing as the prisoner making us believe every word and scene. He plays Henri Young as a pathetic, ruined man who is totally at the mercy of Alcatraz. Gary Oldman is great in a supporting role here, playing a sadistic warden almost in a monstrous bureaucratic way. He is given free reign to do what he does in the film and of course Oldman is at his best when playing borderline psychos with underlying anger issues just waiting to boil up. I only wish his character could have been given a little more screen time. Christian Slater is good as the lawyer and is suited for this part. I am often undecided in my opinion of Christian Slater when I watch him, but I feel that in this movie he does what is needed and plays Stamphill as a decent guy who is fundamentally a humanist. Some scenes are brutal and hard to watch, especially the torture scenes in the dungeons where Bacons's character suffers. Some viewers may actually consider this a movie that requires only the one watch, as it kind of leaves a dark impression on the mind. But this is how it was intended to be made. It's not pretending to be anything else. This is undoubtedly a very moving and powerful film that won't disappoint. If you like strong and solid performances then look no further.

    Though A Largely Fictitious Film, about petty criminal Henri Young, 'Murder in the First', yet comes across as a convincing cinematic experience. Though depressing and hard to stomach, the honesty it's been made and it's hallmark performances, manage to hold your interest. 'Murder in the First' is a about a petty criminal named Henri Young, played by Kevin Bacon, who is put on trial for murder in the first degree. But, a righteous recent law school graduate, played by Christian Slater, takes up the challenge to take up Young's case, and later blames the prison's executives, for the brutal murder committed by Young. 'Murder in the First', like mentioned before, is a largely fictitious take on Henri Young's life. But, cinematically, Henri Young comes across as a frightened victim, who was physically & mentally abused by the Prison's executives. You, in fact, support him here and you sympathize with him all through, and you literally begin to hate the prison's executives. The depiction of Young being in a solitary confinement, and knowing his suffering, shakes you and leaves you numb. 'Murder in the First' is an honest film. Dan Gordon's Writing is hard-hitting & on your-face. The Writer hasn't shy-ed away by not showing what your suppose to watch as a viewer. Marc Rocco's Direction is up-to the mark. He handles the dark, as well as the court-room sequences, with accurate understanding. But, I would like to point out, that, the film is longer than it should have been. It needed to be trimmed, at least, by 15-20 minutes. Performance-Wise: All the actors are Great. Kevin Bacon is nearly exemplary as the frightened victim, Henri Young. His body language, his expressions , as well as his dialogue delivery, are pitch-perfect. Bacon once again proves his range as an actor! Christian Slater scores big time as the righteous lawyer. Gary Oldman is Fantastic! He's so good as the menace, I actually began to hate him. Oldman, genuinely, delivers one of his finest performances here. William H. Macy is perfect, like always. Others lend the required support. On the whole, 'Murder in the First' is not the faint-hearted, as it's too intense & depressing at times. But, it's definitely worth a watch for those, who like watching films, that are written & executed without inhibitions. From this writer, Thumbs Up!
