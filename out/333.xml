 <sinopse>
  Wealthy financier Nicholas Van Orton gets a strange birthday present from wayward brother Conrad: a live-action game that consumes his life.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Nicholas Van Orton is a very wealthy San Francisco banker, but he is an absolute loner, even spending his birthday alone. In the year of his 48th birthday (the age his father committed suicide) his brother Conrad, who has gone long ago and surrendered to addictions of all kinds, suddenly returns and gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to unusual entertainment provided by something called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Giving up to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and all kinds of weird and bad things start to happen to him.

    I saw this years and years ago. I just watched it again for the second time as I have always said it was genius and highly recommended it, and I wondered if I would watch it now and think it was silly as we so often do with changes in maturity levels and experiences. Honestly still one of the best concepts ever. In fact, even though the ultimate point of this movie is the twisting and turning and epic ending, and this time I watched it with the understanding of the plot, I STILL enjoyed it immensely and would still recommend it as highly. The actors are all brilliant, even the supporting roles, and the idea is something that I think is one of the best concepts Hollywood has ever come up with. I don't think they could ever remake this without ruining it and "Hollywoodizing" it, so I am glad it was made as well as it was the first time. The only movie so far that I have given 10 / 10

    I am shocked to see 7.8 rating for this nonsense movie. It was a totally disaster experience. And don't want to waste more time by writing detailed review of this crap movie. But since I am supposed to write minimum 10 lines, I'll write more. It is much worse than what we call in India "Khoda pahaad niklaa chuhaa". It means you built up so much expectation but in the end you just say it was a prank. The climax is least to say 'highly disappointing'. What's the use of having strong cast and actors, if the story is so silly? I think 'Matchstick Man' was far better movie on this theme, where everyone is acting out without the protagonist knowing it'. Really I have already wasted 100 minutes + 7 minutes (writing this review) for this movie.Now I Just hope to save your time.

    Nicholas Van Orton is a wealthy San Francisco banker, but he is a loner, even spending his birthday alone. On the year of his 48th birthday, the age his father committed suicide, his brother Conrad, who absconded long ago and surrendered to addictions of all kinds, returns and gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to an entertainment known as CRS. Giving up to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and weird and bad things start to happen to him..... It was going to be very difficult for Fincher to capture the magic he made with se7en, but my gosh, he gets really close with this under seen gem. This has probably got to be his most under seen work along with Zodiac, and its one of his most intriguing. Douglas plays this sort of role in his sleep, and Orton is not a million miles away from Gekko or the guy from A Perfect Murder, in other words, he plays the rich man effortlessly. Once the Game gets into full swing, it never really let's up until the end, and the viewer really has to suspend disbelief to gain full enjoyment of the movie, because if you start to question the movie, you will find all sorts of silly plot holes that could ruin the movie. You could see the movie almost as 'A Christmas Carol'. Orton is Scrooge, a lone man who doesn't accept gifts from family or friends, and after a revelation on his home one night, his life takes a turn. We see his childhood, and his present, and finally when Orton wakes up in the coffin, what his future has become. All in all, its a fascinating movie, really worth seeing, even if it does resemble a British mini-series from the eighties called 'the one game'

    This film is to the genre Mysteries what Raiders of the Lost Ark is to Action. From nearly the start, it is a slew of one mystery after another. Unfortunately, it is also no good. The mysteries come one after the other with little if any explanation as to *why* stuff happens. We are meant to be thrilled by each tidbit on its own. The one all-encompassing explanation comes at the end -- but we are expected to believe the many near-misses we experienced were all part of the design of the game. Yeah, right. Its a bit like the TV serial which decides to escape from a corner they have painted themselves in by revealing at the start of the next season that the previous season was just a dream.

    This is far from any birthday present you would ever want to forget. A wealthy investment banker receives a present from his wayward brother, Sean Penn, that is most memorable. Michael Douglas is the banker who really undergoes a life altering experience being subjected to this game. His life is literally turned upside down with everyone around him in on this sham, and it becomes pretty terrifying at that. Douglas certainly thinks that he is the victim here and you soon realize why there were early scenes that showed his father's suicide. Could Douglas possibly wind up the same way? This is a creepy, eerie film that makes one think about the order of things. It's nothing more than a scary story with a surprise ending.

    Sorry for my bad English, I'm still learning the language. Fincher is one of my favorite directors. Douglas and Penn are among my favorite actors. I expected a great, entertaining, and unforgettable movie. I wasn't disappointed, I got a very entertaining film. When Nicholas "shot" Conrad, I knew that he'll jump down from the building, because his father was also 48 year-old, when he committed suicide on that way. When it was revealed, I knew that Nicholas won't survive the movie without a jump like that. Shame, Penn didn't play so much, how much I expected. But Douglas gave everything in this movie. I had the uncertainty in the full movie (like in "The Thing"), and it was a very positive experience. At last, it was one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.

    This film has a very a interesting story about a banker, containing some possible 9/11 references. Here are a couple of quotes I picked up... Christine.. "It's all a game Â….. special effects like squib squibs (sounds like squibs was mentioned twice?) in the movies" Nicholas.. "....sheer some more sheep" The first quote was just before while the second quote just after the scene of the main character throwing himself off the top of a skyscraper near the end of the movie, while both quotes seemed odd and slightly out of context unless the film is viewed after 9/11 and then they make sense. The subtext has many meanings. I think one of the meanings is how Nicholas Van Orton's "birthday surprise" had been planned by a corporation, with lots of tragic events leading up to his jump off the skyscraper. This had been orchestrated by large number of people without them all being aware of the true outcome, this being four years before and mirroring the events on 9/11, and possible during the planning stages thus through very intricate planning anything can be made believable.

    Michael Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy investment banker, living a somber, lonesome life in a luxurious mansion that is only inhabited by himself after his divorce. He has become miserable and decidedly unfulfilled lately, but begins to walk down a path of, well, let's say excitement when, on his forty-eight birthday, his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) informs him about a group called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). CRS specializes in something called "the game," which Conrad leaves highly ambiguous, only providing the vague details that Nicholas must try it and leaving him with the encompassing notion that it will change his life. After delaying his visit to the company, to apply for "the game," he undergoes a series of exhausting and lengthy psychological and physical examinations to, allegedly, show his fitness for the exercise. Later that week, he is told his application is rejected, oblivious to the fact that "the game" itself has already begun. He discovers this one night when his TV begins talking directly to him, informing him about a series of keys that will come in handy at one point or another. What unfolds is a virtual video game, so to speak, with Nicholas himself, and the viewers of the film, questioning what is real and what is fictitious. Films like David Fincher's The Game provide us with a unique, viable luxury, which is knowing about as much, or sometimes less, as the main character. In this case, we spend most of the film as confused as Nicholas, lost and wandering in the limitless, sometimes unknowable forces of reality. Writing about The Game, or even talking about The Game to someone who hasn't seen it, just doesn't work in retrospect. The aesthetics and plot developments can only be described so thoroughly before they channel lunacy and incomprehensible nonsense. Even seeing the film seems to have the same effect. This is truly a work that exercises in the unexplainable field of cinema and does it great justice. Coming off of Fincher's acclaimed film Se7en, which has gone criminally unseen by me, to follow up with a film like The Game would logically generate mixed reception. The tone it holds is dark and heavy, accompanied by imagery and visuals that are bleak and replicate the look of film noir, and the story is non-linear and possesses a fondness to trick viewers and critics of it. This is a film that likes to play with your emotions and toy with your head as you watch it. Depending on how much of that you can stomach (for me, a film can only do so much of that before I stop caring and see through its roots of being a convoluted mish-mash of storytelling devices), this may be satisfying and wholly substantial. It does what a film of its magnitude should do and that is provide its story and approach with equal opportunities of commentary and explanation. I think I've got one. "The Game" in itself is something that is used for those who want to add energy, excitement, and thrill to their lives. It's a device created for those who have yet to "live" or enjoy life on its own terms. It exists to show its players a good time, and even when they're struggling or beyond scared, it is still the most fun and excitement they've had in years. Take the above explanation in any way you see fit, and add it to as it doesn't even seem to cover the entire span of open-endedness this film has in store. While The Game lacks in emotional character involvement and, towards the end, becomes rather redundant and plodding, it succeeds in developing a frightening and eerie utopia that, while giving its participants satisfaction and adventure, provides them with a scarring, indelible mark. Take that however you want as well. Starring: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by: David Fincher.

    ** SPOILER ** Is it possible everybody in this movie was "in on it" ? Every accident, every "death" was staged. There was no deep rewakening, just a lot of silliness. Some how after 1.5 hr of phony plots, I wish Sean Penn and the lawyer were really in an evil plot to take over Mike Douglas's business empire. The film is well-made which is a waste; you'd get tired after seeing everything was a spoof. Who is being made fool here? Example of this silliness would have Mike Douglas jumped off a sky scraper after another staged scene, thru a cathedral glass ceiling,onto a marked landing balloon to the applause of an awaiting dinner party. Of course, they know the exact spot Douglas will jump and therefore aligned the landing perfectly. Find some other more intelligent game to play.

    Is it a hoax, a puzzle or a scam? No, The Game is a continual attack on the status quo of a our mark, a wildly successful holier-than-thou investment broker, personified by Michael Douglass. Does anyone in America not believe that Michael Douglass is a power broker richer than our wildest dreams? Brought on by his movie brother, Sean Penn, this amazingly elaborate intervention contains a multi-layered, thrilling plot, invigorated by the family theme or motive behind the ruse. The rabbit hole of confusion is continually re-introduced by the enticing Debra Kara Unger and the suspense ensues. Entertaining but Fincher missed the chance to elevate the film by avoiding deeper personal issues only addressed on the surface. Would it have hurt the film to find some spirituality from this escapade? Seemed to take a pass on that chance.

    I saw this years and years ago. I just watched it again for the second time as I have always said it was genius and highly recommended it, and I wondered if I would watch it now and think it was silly as we so often do with changes in maturity levels and experiences. Honestly still one of the best concepts ever. In fact, even though the ultimate point of this movie is the twisting and turning and epic ending, and this time I watched it with the understanding of the plot, I STILL enjoyed it immensely and would still recommend it as highly. The actors are all brilliant, even the supporting roles, and the idea is something that I think is one of the best concepts Hollywood has ever come up with. I don't think they could ever remake this without ruining it and "Hollywoodizing" it, so I am glad it was made as well as it was the first time. The only movie so far that I have given 10 / 10

    I am shocked to see 7.8 rating for this nonsense movie. It was a totally disaster experience. And don't want to waste more time by writing detailed review of this crap movie. But since I am supposed to write minimum 10 lines, I'll write more. It is much worse than what we call in India "Khoda pahaad niklaa chuhaa". It means you built up so much expectation but in the end you just say it was a prank. The climax is least to say 'highly disappointing'. What's the use of having strong cast and actors, if the story is so silly? I think 'Matchstick Man' was far better movie on this theme, where everyone is acting out without the protagonist knowing it'. Really I have already wasted 100 minutes + 7 minutes (writing this review) for this movie.Now I Just hope to save your time.

    Nicholas Van Orton is a wealthy San Francisco banker, but he is a loner, even spending his birthday alone. On the year of his 48th birthday, the age his father committed suicide, his brother Conrad, who absconded long ago and surrendered to addictions of all kinds, returns and gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to an entertainment known as CRS. Giving up to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and weird and bad things start to happen to him..... It was going to be very difficult for Fincher to capture the magic he made with se7en, but my gosh, he gets really close with this under seen gem. This has probably got to be his most under seen work along with Zodiac, and its one of his most intriguing. Douglas plays this sort of role in his sleep, and Orton is not a million miles away from Gekko or the guy from A Perfect Murder, in other words, he plays the rich man effortlessly. Once the Game gets into full swing, it never really let's up until the end, and the viewer really has to suspend disbelief to gain full enjoyment of the movie, because if you start to question the movie, you will find all sorts of silly plot holes that could ruin the movie. You could see the movie almost as 'A Christmas Carol'. Orton is Scrooge, a lone man who doesn't accept gifts from family or friends, and after a revelation on his home one night, his life takes a turn. We see his childhood, and his present, and finally when Orton wakes up in the coffin, what his future has become. All in all, its a fascinating movie, really worth seeing, even if it does resemble a British mini-series from the eighties called 'the one game'

    This film is to the genre Mysteries what Raiders of the Lost Ark is to Action. From nearly the start, it is a slew of one mystery after another. Unfortunately, it is also no good. The mysteries come one after the other with little if any explanation as to *why* stuff happens. We are meant to be thrilled by each tidbit on its own. The one all-encompassing explanation comes at the end -- but we are expected to believe the many near-misses we experienced were all part of the design of the game. Yeah, right. Its a bit like the TV serial which decides to escape from a corner they have painted themselves in by revealing at the start of the next season that the previous season was just a dream.

    This is far from any birthday present you would ever want to forget. A wealthy investment banker receives a present from his wayward brother, Sean Penn, that is most memorable. Michael Douglas is the banker who really undergoes a life altering experience being subjected to this game. His life is literally turned upside down with everyone around him in on this sham, and it becomes pretty terrifying at that. Douglas certainly thinks that he is the victim here and you soon realize why there were early scenes that showed his father's suicide. Could Douglas possibly wind up the same way? This is a creepy, eerie film that makes one think about the order of things. It's nothing more than a scary story with a surprise ending.

    Sorry for my bad English, I'm still learning the language. Fincher is one of my favorite directors. Douglas and Penn are among my favorite actors. I expected a great, entertaining, and unforgettable movie. I wasn't disappointed, I got a very entertaining film. When Nicholas "shot" Conrad, I knew that he'll jump down from the building, because his father was also 48 year-old, when he committed suicide on that way. When it was revealed, I knew that Nicholas won't survive the movie without a jump like that. Shame, Penn didn't play so much, how much I expected. But Douglas gave everything in this movie. I had the uncertainty in the full movie (like in "The Thing"), and it was a very positive experience. At last, it was one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.

    This film has a very a interesting story about a banker, containing some possible 9/11 references. Here are a couple of quotes I picked up... Christine.. "It's all a game Â….. special effects like squib squibs (sounds like squibs was mentioned twice?) in the movies" Nicholas.. "....sheer some more sheep" The first quote was just before while the second quote just after the scene of the main character throwing himself off the top of a skyscraper near the end of the movie, while both quotes seemed odd and slightly out of context unless the film is viewed after 9/11 and then they make sense. The subtext has many meanings. I think one of the meanings is how Nicholas Van Orton's "birthday surprise" had been planned by a corporation, with lots of tragic events leading up to his jump off the skyscraper. This had been orchestrated by large number of people without them all being aware of the true outcome, this being four years before and mirroring the events on 9/11, and possible during the planning stages thus through very intricate planning anything can be made believable.

    Michael Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy investment banker, living a somber, lonesome life in a luxurious mansion that is only inhabited by himself after his divorce. He has become miserable and decidedly unfulfilled lately, but begins to walk down a path of, well, let's say excitement when, on his forty-eight birthday, his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) informs him about a group called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). CRS specializes in something called "the game," which Conrad leaves highly ambiguous, only providing the vague details that Nicholas must try it and leaving him with the encompassing notion that it will change his life. After delaying his visit to the company, to apply for "the game," he undergoes a series of exhausting and lengthy psychological and physical examinations to, allegedly, show his fitness for the exercise. Later that week, he is told his application is rejected, oblivious to the fact that "the game" itself has already begun. He discovers this one night when his TV begins talking directly to him, informing him about a series of keys that will come in handy at one point or another. What unfolds is a virtual video game, so to speak, with Nicholas himself, and the viewers of the film, questioning what is real and what is fictitious. Films like David Fincher's The Game provide us with a unique, viable luxury, which is knowing about as much, or sometimes less, as the main character. In this case, we spend most of the film as confused as Nicholas, lost and wandering in the limitless, sometimes unknowable forces of reality. Writing about The Game, or even talking about The Game to someone who hasn't seen it, just doesn't work in retrospect. The aesthetics and plot developments can only be described so thoroughly before they channel lunacy and incomprehensible nonsense. Even seeing the film seems to have the same effect. This is truly a work that exercises in the unexplainable field of cinema and does it great justice. Coming off of Fincher's acclaimed film Se7en, which has gone criminally unseen by me, to follow up with a film like The Game would logically generate mixed reception. The tone it holds is dark and heavy, accompanied by imagery and visuals that are bleak and replicate the look of film noir, and the story is non-linear and possesses a fondness to trick viewers and critics of it. This is a film that likes to play with your emotions and toy with your head as you watch it. Depending on how much of that you can stomach (for me, a film can only do so much of that before I stop caring and see through its roots of being a convoluted mish-mash of storytelling devices), this may be satisfying and wholly substantial. It does what a film of its magnitude should do and that is provide its story and approach with equal opportunities of commentary and explanation. I think I've got one. "The Game" in itself is something that is used for those who want to add energy, excitement, and thrill to their lives. It's a device created for those who have yet to "live" or enjoy life on its own terms. It exists to show its players a good time, and even when they're struggling or beyond scared, it is still the most fun and excitement they've had in years. Take the above explanation in any way you see fit, and add it to as it doesn't even seem to cover the entire span of open-endedness this film has in store. While The Game lacks in emotional character involvement and, towards the end, becomes rather redundant and plodding, it succeeds in developing a frightening and eerie utopia that, while giving its participants satisfaction and adventure, provides them with a scarring, indelible mark. Take that however you want as well. Starring: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by: David Fincher.

    ** SPOILER ** Is it possible everybody in this movie was "in on it" ? Every accident, every "death" was staged. There was no deep rewakening, just a lot of silliness. Some how after 1.5 hr of phony plots, I wish Sean Penn and the lawyer were really in an evil plot to take over Mike Douglas's business empire. The film is well-made which is a waste; you'd get tired after seeing everything was a spoof. Who is being made fool here? Example of this silliness would have Mike Douglas jumped off a sky scraper after another staged scene, thru a cathedral glass ceiling,onto a marked landing balloon to the applause of an awaiting dinner party. Of course, they know the exact spot Douglas will jump and therefore aligned the landing perfectly. Find some other more intelligent game to play.

    Is it a hoax, a puzzle or a scam? No, The Game is a continual attack on the status quo of a our mark, a wildly successful holier-than-thou investment broker, personified by Michael Douglass. Does anyone in America not believe that Michael Douglass is a power broker richer than our wildest dreams? Brought on by his movie brother, Sean Penn, this amazingly elaborate intervention contains a multi-layered, thrilling plot, invigorated by the family theme or motive behind the ruse. The rabbit hole of confusion is continually re-introduced by the enticing Debra Kara Unger and the suspense ensues. Entertaining but Fincher missed the chance to elevate the film by avoiding deeper personal issues only addressed on the surface. Would it have hurt the film to find some spirituality from this escapade? Seemed to take a pass on that chance.

Really I have already wasted 100 minutes + 7 minutes (writing this review) for this movie.Now I Just hope to save your time.

    Nicholas Van Orton is a wealthy San Francisco banker, but he is a loner, even spending his birthday alone. On the year of his 48th birthday, the age his father committed suicide, his brother Conrad, who absconded long ago and surrendered to addictions of all kinds, returns and gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to an entertainment known as CRS. Giving up to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and weird and bad things start to happen to him..... It was going to be very difficult for Fincher to capture the magic he made with se7en, but my gosh, he gets really close with this under seen gem. This has probably got to be his most under seen work along with Zodiac, and its one of his most intriguing. Douglas plays this sort of role in his sleep, and Orton is not a million miles away from Gekko or the guy from A Perfect Murder, in other words, he plays the rich man effortlessly. Once the Game gets into full swing, it never really let's up until the end, and the viewer really has to suspend disbelief to gain full enjoyment of the movie, because if you start to question the movie, you will find all sorts of silly plot holes that could ruin the movie. You could see the movie almost as 'A Christmas Carol'. Orton is Scrooge, a lone man who doesn't accept gifts from family or friends, and after a revelation on his home one night, his life takes a turn. We see his childhood, and his present, and finally when Orton wakes up in the coffin, what his future has become. All in all, its a fascinating movie, really worth seeing, even if it does resemble a British mini-series from the eighties called 'the one game'

    This film is to the genre Mysteries what Raiders of the Lost Ark is to Action. From nearly the start, it is a slew of one mystery after another. Unfortunately, it is also no good. The mysteries come one after the other with little if any explanation as to *why* stuff happens. We are meant to be thrilled by each tidbit on its own. The one all-encompassing explanation comes at the end -- but we are expected to believe the many near-misses we experienced were all part of the design of the game. Yeah, right. Its a bit like the TV serial which decides to escape from a corner they have painted themselves in by revealing at the start of the next season that the previous season was just a dream.

    This is far from any birthday present you would ever want to forget. A wealthy investment banker receives a present from his wayward brother, Sean Penn, that is most memorable. Michael Douglas is the banker who really undergoes a life altering experience being subjected to this game. His life is literally turned upside down with everyone around him in on this sham, and it becomes pretty terrifying at that. Douglas certainly thinks that he is the victim here and you soon realize why there were early scenes that showed his father's suicide. Could Douglas possibly wind up the same way? This is a creepy, eerie film that makes one think about the order of things. It's nothing more than a scary story with a surprise ending.

    Sorry for my bad English, I'm still learning the language. Fincher is one of my favorite directors. Douglas and Penn are among my favorite actors. I expected a great, entertaining, and unforgettable movie. I wasn't disappointed, I got a very entertaining film. When Nicholas "shot" Conrad, I knew that he'll jump down from the building, because his father was also 48 year-old, when he committed suicide on that way. When it was revealed, I knew that Nicholas won't survive the movie without a jump like that. Shame, Penn didn't play so much, how much I expected. But Douglas gave everything in this movie. I had the uncertainty in the full movie (like in "The Thing"), and it was a very positive experience. At last, it was one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.

    This film has a very a interesting story about a banker, containing some possible 9/11 references. Here are a couple of quotes I picked up... Christine.. "It's all a game Â….. special effects like squib squibs (sounds like squibs was mentioned twice?) in the movies" Nicholas.. "....sheer some more sheep" The first quote was just before while the second quote just after the scene of the main character throwing himself off the top of a skyscraper near the end of the movie, while both quotes seemed odd and slightly out of context unless the film is viewed after 9/11 and then they make sense. The subtext has many meanings. I think one of the meanings is how Nicholas Van Orton's "birthday surprise" had been planned by a corporation, with lots of tragic events leading up to his jump off the skyscraper. This had been orchestrated by large number of people without them all being aware of the true outcome, this being four years before and mirroring the events on 9/11, and possible during the planning stages thus through very intricate planning anything can be made believable.

    Michael Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy investment banker, living a somber, lonesome life in a luxurious mansion that is only inhabited by himself after his divorce. He has become miserable and decidedly unfulfilled lately, but begins to walk down a path of, well, let's say excitement when, on his forty-eight birthday, his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) informs him about a group called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). CRS specializes in something called "the game," which Conrad leaves highly ambiguous, only providing the vague details that Nicholas must try it and leaving him with the encompassing notion that it will change his life. After delaying his visit to the company, to apply for "the game," he undergoes a series of exhausting and lengthy psychological and physical examinations to, allegedly, show his fitness for the exercise. Later that week, he is told his application is rejected, oblivious to the fact that "the game" itself has already begun. He discovers this one night when his TV begins talking directly to him, informing him about a series of keys that will come in handy at one point or another. What unfolds is a virtual video game, so to speak, with Nicholas himself, and the viewers of the film, questioning what is real and what is fictitious. Films like David Fincher's The Game provide us with a unique, viable luxury, which is knowing about as much, or sometimes less, as the main character. In this case, we spend most of the film as confused as Nicholas, lost and wandering in the limitless, sometimes unknowable forces of reality. Writing about The Game, or even talking about The Game to someone who hasn't seen it, just doesn't work in retrospect. The aesthetics and plot developments can only be described so thoroughly before they channel lunacy and incomprehensible nonsense. Even seeing the film seems to have the same effect. This is truly a work that exercises in the unexplainable field of cinema and does it great justice. Coming off of Fincher's acclaimed film Se7en, which has gone criminally unseen by me, to follow up with a film like The Game would logically generate mixed reception. The tone it holds is dark and heavy, accompanied by imagery and visuals that are bleak and replicate the look of film noir, and the story is non-linear and possesses a fondness to trick viewers and critics of it. This is a film that likes to play with your emotions and toy with your head as you watch it. Depending on how much of that you can stomach (for me, a film can only do so much of that before I stop caring and see through its roots of being a convoluted mish-mash of storytelling devices), this may be satisfying and wholly substantial. It does what a film of its magnitude should do and that is provide its story and approach with equal opportunities of commentary and explanation. I think I've got one. "The Game" in itself is something that is used for those who want to add energy, excitement, and thrill to their lives. It's a device created for those who have yet to "live" or enjoy life on its own terms. It exists to show its players a good time, and even when they're struggling or beyond scared, it is still the most fun and excitement they've had in years. Take the above explanation in any way you see fit, and add it to as it doesn't even seem to cover the entire span of open-endedness this film has in store. While The Game lacks in emotional character involvement and, towards the end, becomes rather redundant and plodding, it succeeds in developing a frightening and eerie utopia that, while giving its participants satisfaction and adventure, provides them with a scarring, indelible mark. Take that however you want as well. Starring: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by: David Fincher.

    ** SPOILER ** Is it possible everybody in this movie was "in on it" ? Every accident, every "death" was staged. There was no deep rewakening, just a lot of silliness. Some how after 1.5 hr of phony plots, I wish Sean Penn and the lawyer were really in an evil plot to take over Mike Douglas's business empire. The film is well-made which is a waste; you'd get tired after seeing everything was a spoof. Who is being made fool here? Example of this silliness would have Mike Douglas jumped off a sky scraper after another staged scene, thru a cathedral glass ceiling,onto a marked landing balloon to the applause of an awaiting dinner party. Of course, they know the exact spot Douglas will jump and therefore aligned the landing perfectly. Find some other more intelligent game to play.

    Is it a hoax, a puzzle or a scam? No, The Game is a continual attack on the status quo of a our mark, a wildly successful holier-than-thou investment broker, personified by Michael Douglass. Does anyone in America not believe that Michael Douglass is a power broker richer than our wildest dreams? Brought on by his movie brother, Sean Penn, this amazingly elaborate intervention contains a multi-layered, thrilling plot, invigorated by the family theme or motive behind the ruse. The rabbit hole of confusion is continually re-introduced by the enticing Debra Kara Unger and the suspense ensues. Entertaining but Fincher missed the chance to elevate the film by avoiding deeper personal issues only addressed on the surface. Would it have hurt the film to find some spirituality from this escapade? Seemed to take a pass on that chance.

    I saw this years and years ago. I just watched it again for the second time as I have always said it was genius and highly recommended it, and I wondered if I would watch it now and think it was silly as we so often do with changes in maturity levels and experiences. Honestly still one of the best concepts ever. In fact, even though the ultimate point of this movie is the twisting and turning and epic ending, and this time I watched it with the understanding of the plot, I STILL enjoyed it immensely and would still recommend it as highly. The actors are all brilliant, even the supporting roles, and the idea is something that I think is one of the best concepts Hollywood has ever come up with. I don't think they could ever remake this without ruining it and "Hollywoodizing" it, so I am glad it was made as well as it was the first time. The only movie so far that I have given 10 / 10

    I am shocked to see 7.8 rating for this nonsense movie. It was a totally disaster experience. And don't want to waste more time by writing detailed review of this crap movie. But since I am supposed to write minimum 10 lines, I'll write more. It is much worse than what we call in India "Khoda pahaad niklaa chuhaa". It means you built up so much expectation but in the end you just say it was a prank. The climax is least to say 'highly disappointing'. What's the use of having strong cast and actors, if the story is so silly?

    This film is to the genre Mysteries what Raiders of the Lost Ark is to Action. From nearly the start, it is a slew of one mystery after another. Unfortunately, it is also no good. The mysteries come one after the other with little if any explanation as to *why* stuff happens. We are meant to be thrilled by each tidbit on its own. The one all-encompassing explanation comes at the end -- but we are expected to believe the many near-misses we experienced were all part of the design of the game. Yeah, right. Its a bit like the TV serial which decides to escape from a corner they have painted themselves in by revealing at the start of the next season that the previous season was just a dream.

    This is far from any birthday present you would ever want to forget. A wealthy investment banker receives a present from his wayward brother, Sean Penn, that is most memorable. Michael Douglas is the banker who really undergoes a life altering experience being subjected to this game. His life is literally turned upside down with everyone around him in on this sham, and it becomes pretty terrifying at that. Douglas certainly thinks that he is the victim here and you soon realize why there were early scenes that showed his father's suicide. Could Douglas possibly wind up the same way? This is a creepy, eerie film that makes one think about the order of things. It's nothing more than a scary story with a surprise ending.

    Sorry for my bad English, I'm still learning the language. Fincher is one of my favorite directors. Douglas and Penn are among my favorite actors. I expected a great, entertaining, and unforgettable movie. I wasn't disappointed, I got a very entertaining film. When Nicholas "shot" Conrad, I knew that he'll jump down from the building, because his father was also 48 year-old, when he committed suicide on that way. When it was revealed, I knew that Nicholas won't survive the movie without a jump like that. Shame, Penn didn't play so much, how much I expected. But Douglas gave everything in this movie. I had the uncertainty in the full movie (like in "The Thing"), and it was a very positive experience. At last, it was one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.

    This film has a very a interesting story about a banker, containing some possible 9/11 references. Here are a couple of quotes I picked up... Christine.. "It's all a game Â….. special effects like squib squibs (sounds like squibs was mentioned twice?) in the movies" Nicholas.. "....sheer some more sheep" The first quote was just before while the second quote just after the scene of the main character throwing himself off the top of a skyscraper near the end of the movie, while both quotes seemed odd and slightly out of context unless the film is viewed after 9/11 and then they make sense. The subtext has many meanings. I think one of the meanings is how Nicholas Van Orton's "birthday surprise" had been planned by a corporation, with lots of tragic events leading up to his jump off the skyscraper. This had been orchestrated by large number of people without them all being aware of the true outcome, this being four years before and mirroring the events on 9/11, and possible during the planning stages thus through very intricate planning anything can be made believable.

    Michael Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy investment banker, living a somber, lonesome life in a luxurious mansion that is only inhabited by himself after his divorce. He has become miserable and decidedly unfulfilled lately, but begins to walk down a path of, well, let's say excitement when, on his forty-eight birthday, his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) informs him about a group called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). CRS specializes in something called "the game," which Conrad leaves highly ambiguous, only providing the vague details that Nicholas must try it and leaving him with the encompassing notion that it will change his life. After delaying his visit to the company, to apply for "the game," he undergoes a series of exhausting and lengthy psychological and physical examinations to, allegedly, show his fitness for the exercise. Later that week, he is told his application is rejected, oblivious to the fact that "the game" itself has already begun. He discovers this one night when his TV begins talking directly to him, informing him about a series of keys that will come in handy at one point or another. What unfolds is a virtual video game, so to speak, with Nicholas himself, and the viewers of the film, questioning what is real and what is fictitious. Films like David Fincher's The Game provide us with a unique, viable luxury, which is knowing about as much, or sometimes less, as the main character. In this case, we spend most of the film as confused as Nicholas, lost and wandering in the limitless, sometimes unknowable forces of reality. Writing about The Game, or even talking about The Game to someone who hasn't seen it, just doesn't work in retrospect. The aesthetics and plot developments can only be described so thoroughly before they channel lunacy and incomprehensible nonsense. Even seeing the film seems to have the same effect. This is truly a work that exercises in the unexplainable field of cinema and does it great justice. Coming off of Fincher's acclaimed film Se7en, which has gone criminally unseen by me, to follow up with a film like The Game would logically generate mixed reception. The tone it holds is dark and heavy, accompanied by imagery and visuals that are bleak and replicate the look of film noir, and the story is non-linear and possesses a fondness to trick viewers and critics of it. This is a film that likes to play with your emotions and toy with your head as you watch it. Depending on how much of that you can stomach (for me, a film can only do so much of that before I stop caring and see through its roots of being a convoluted mish-mash of storytelling devices), this may be satisfying and wholly substantial. It does what a film of its magnitude should do and that is provide its story and approach with equal opportunities of commentary and explanation. I think I've got one. "The Game" in itself is something that is used for those who want to add energy, excitement, and thrill to their lives. It's a device created for those who have yet to "live" or enjoy life on its own terms. It exists to show its players a good time, and even when they're struggling or beyond scared, it is still the most fun and excitement they've had in years. Take the above explanation in any way you see fit, and add it to as it doesn't even seem to cover the entire span of open-endedness this film has in store. While The Game lacks in emotional character involvement and, towards the end, becomes rather redundant and plodding, it succeeds in developing a frightening and eerie utopia that, while giving its participants satisfaction and adventure, provides them with a scarring, indelible mark. Take that however you want as well. Starring: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by: David Fincher.

    ** SPOILER ** Is it possible everybody in this movie was "in on it" ? Every accident, every "death" was staged. There was no deep rewakening, just a lot of silliness. Some how after 1.5 hr of phony plots, I wish Sean Penn and the lawyer were really in an evil plot to take over Mike Douglas's business empire. The film is well-made which is a waste; you'd get tired after seeing everything was a spoof. Who is being made fool here? Example of this silliness would have Mike Douglas jumped off a sky scraper after another staged scene, thru a cathedral glass ceiling,onto a marked landing balloon to the applause of an awaiting dinner party. Of course, they know the exact spot Douglas will jump and therefore aligned the landing perfectly. Find some other more intelligent game to play.

    Is it a hoax, a puzzle or a scam? No, The Game is a continual attack on the status quo of a our mark, a wildly successful holier-than-thou investment broker, personified by Michael Douglass. Does anyone in America not believe that Michael Douglass is a power broker richer than our wildest dreams? Brought on by his movie brother, Sean Penn, this amazingly elaborate intervention contains a multi-layered, thrilling plot, invigorated by the family theme or motive behind the ruse. The rabbit hole of confusion is continually re-introduced by the enticing Debra Kara Unger and the suspense ensues. Entertaining but Fincher missed the chance to elevate the film by avoiding deeper personal issues only addressed on the surface. Would it have hurt the film to find some spirituality from this escapade? Seemed to take a pass on that chance.

    I saw this years and years ago. I just watched it again for the second time as I have always said it was genius and highly recommended it, and I wondered if I would watch it now and think it was silly as we so often do with changes in maturity levels and experiences. Honestly still one of the best concepts ever. In fact, even though the ultimate point of this movie is the twisting and turning and epic ending, and this time I watched it with the understanding of the plot, I STILL enjoyed it immensely and would still recommend it as highly. The actors are all brilliant, even the supporting roles, and the idea is something that I think is one of the best concepts Hollywood has ever come up with. I don't think they could ever remake this without ruining it and "Hollywoodizing" it, so I am glad it was made as well as it was the first time. The only movie so far that I have given 10 / 10

    I am shocked to see 7.8 rating for this nonsense movie. It was a totally disaster experience. And don't want to waste more time by writing detailed review of this crap movie. But since I am supposed to write minimum 10 lines, I'll write more. It is much worse than what we call in India "Khoda pahaad niklaa chuhaa". It means you built up so much expectation but in the end you just say it was a prank. The climax is least to say 'highly disappointing'. What's the use of having strong cast and actors, if the story is so silly? I think 'Matchstick Man' was far better movie on this theme, where everyone is acting out without the protagonist knowing it'. Really I have already wasted 100 minutes + 7 minutes (writing this review) for this movie.Now I Just hope to save your time.

    Nicholas Van Orton is a wealthy San Francisco banker, but he is a loner, even spending his birthday alone. On the year of his 48th birthday, the age his father committed suicide, his brother Conrad, who absconded long ago and surrendered to addictions of all kinds, returns and gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to an entertainment known as CRS. Giving up to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and weird and bad things start to happen to him..... It was going to be very difficult for Fincher to capture the magic he made with se7en, but my gosh, he gets really close with this under seen gem. This has probably got to be his most under seen work along with Zodiac, and its one of his most intriguing. Douglas plays this sort of role in his sleep, and Orton is not a million miles away from Gekko or the guy from A Perfect Murder, in other words, he plays the rich man effortlessly. Once the Game gets into full swing, it never really let's up until the end, and the viewer really has to suspend disbelief to gain full enjoyment of the movie, because if you start to question the movie, you will find all sorts of silly plot holes that could ruin the movie. You could see the movie almost as 'A Christmas Carol'. Orton is Scrooge, a lone man who doesn't accept gifts from family or friends, and after a revelation on his home one night, his life takes a turn. We see his childhood, and his present, and finally when Orton wakes up in the coffin, what his future has become. All in all, its a fascinating movie, really worth seeing, even if it does resemble a British mini-series from the eighties called 'the one game'

    Sorry for my bad English, I'm still learning the language. Fincher is one of my favorite directors. Douglas and Penn are among my favorite actors. I expected a great, entertaining, and unforgettable movie. I wasn't disappointed, I got a very entertaining film. When Nicholas "shot" Conrad, I knew that he'll jump down from the building, because his father was also 48 year-old, when he committed suicide on that way. When it was revealed, I knew that Nicholas won't survive the movie without a jump like that. Shame, Penn didn't play so much, how much I expected. But Douglas gave everything in this movie. I had the uncertainty in the full movie (like in "The Thing"), and it was a very positive experience. At last, it was one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen.

    This film has a very a interesting story about a banker, containing some possible 9/11 references. Here are a couple of quotes I picked up... Christine.. "It's all a game Â….. special effects like squib squibs (sounds like squibs was mentioned twice?) in the movies" Nicholas.. "....sheer some more sheep" The first quote was just before while the second quote just after the scene of the main character throwing himself off the top of a skyscraper near the end of the movie, while both quotes seemed odd and slightly out of context unless the film is viewed after 9/11 and then they make sense. The subtext has many meanings. I think one of the meanings is how Nicholas Van Orton's "birthday surprise" had been planned by a corporation, with lots of tragic events leading up to his jump off the skyscraper. This had been orchestrated by large number of people without them all being aware of the true outcome, this being four years before and mirroring the events on 9/11, and possible during the planning stages thus through very intricate planning anything can be made believable.

    Michael Douglas is Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy investment banker, living a somber, lonesome life in a luxurious mansion that is only inhabited by himself after his divorce. He has become miserable and decidedly unfulfilled lately, but begins to walk down a path of, well, let's say excitement when, on his forty-eight birthday, his brother Conrad (Sean Penn) informs him about a group called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). CRS specializes in something called "the game," which Conrad leaves highly ambiguous, only providing the vague details that Nicholas must try it and leaving him with the encompassing notion that it will change his life. After delaying his visit to the company, to apply for "the game," he undergoes a series of exhausting and lengthy psychological and physical examinations to, allegedly, show his fitness for the exercise. Later that week, he is told his application is rejected, oblivious to the fact that "the game" itself has already begun. He discovers this one night when his TV begins talking directly to him, informing him about a series of keys that will come in handy at one point or another. What unfolds is a virtual video game, so to speak, with Nicholas himself, and the viewers of the film, questioning what is real and what is fictitious. Films like David Fincher's The Game provide us with a unique, viable luxury, which is knowing about as much, or sometimes less, as the main character. In this case, we spend most of the film as confused as Nicholas, lost and wandering in the limitless, sometimes unknowable forces of reality. Writing about The Game, or even talking about The Game to someone who hasn't seen it, just doesn't work in retrospect. The aesthetics and plot developments can only be described so thoroughly before they channel lunacy and incomprehensible nonsense. Even seeing the film seems to have the same effect. This is truly a work that exercises in the unexplainable field of cinema and does it great justice. Coming off of Fincher's acclaimed film Se7en, which has gone criminally unseen by me, to follow up with a film like The Game would logically generate mixed reception. The tone it holds is dark and heavy, accompanied by imagery and visuals that are bleak and replicate the look of film noir, and the story is non-linear and possesses a fondness to trick viewers and critics of it. This is a film that likes to play with your emotions and toy with your head as you watch it. Depending on how much of that you can stomach (for me, a film can only do so much of that before I stop caring and see through its roots of being a convoluted mish-mash of storytelling devices), this may be satisfying and wholly substantial. It does what a film of its magnitude should do and that is provide its story and approach with equal opportunities of commentary and explanation. I think I've got one. "The Game" in itself is something that is used for those who want to add energy, excitement, and thrill to their lives. It's a device created for those who have yet to "live" or enjoy life on its own terms. It exists to show its players a good time, and even when they're struggling or beyond scared, it is still the most fun and excitement they've had in years. Take the above explanation in any way you see fit, and add it to as it doesn't even seem to cover the entire span of open-endedness this film has in store. While The Game lacks in emotional character involvement and, towards the end, becomes rather redundant and plodding, it succeeds in developing a frightening and eerie utopia that, while giving its participants satisfaction and adventure, provides them with a scarring, indelible mark. Take that however you want as well. Starring: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by: David Fincher.

    ** SPOILER ** Is it possible everybody in this movie was "in on it" ? Every accident, every "death" was staged. There was no deep rewakening, just a lot of silliness. Some how after 1.5 hr of phony plots, I wish Sean Penn and the lawyer were really in an evil plot to take over Mike Douglas's business empire. The film is well-made which is a waste; you'd get tired after seeing everything was a spoof. Who is being made fool here? Example of this silliness would have Mike Douglas jumped off a sky scraper after another staged scene, thru a cathedral glass ceiling,onto a marked landing balloon to the applause of an awaiting dinner party. Of course, they know the exact spot Douglas will jump and therefore aligned the landing perfectly. Find some other more intelligent game to play.

    Is it a hoax, a puzzle or a scam? No, The Game is a continual attack on the status quo of a our mark, a wildly successful holier-than-thou investment broker, personified by Michael Douglass. Does anyone in America not believe that Michael Douglass is a power broker richer than our wildest dreams? Brought on by his movie brother, Sean Penn, this amazingly elaborate intervention contains a multi-layered, thrilling plot, invigorated by the family theme or motive behind the ruse. The rabbit hole of confusion is continually re-introduced by the enticing Debra Kara Unger and the suspense ensues. Entertaining but Fincher missed the chance to elevate the film by avoiding deeper personal issues only addressed on the surface. Would it have hurt the film to find some spirituality from this escapade? Seemed to take a pass on that chance.

    I saw this years and years ago. I just watched it again for the second time as I have always said it was genius and highly recommended it, and I wondered if I would watch it now and think it was silly as we so often do with changes in maturity levels and experiences. Honestly still one of the best concepts ever. In fact, even though the ultimate point of this movie is the twisting and turning and epic ending, and this time I watched it with the understanding of the plot, I STILL enjoyed it immensely and would still recommend it as highly. The actors are all brilliant, even the supporting roles, and the idea is something that I think is one of the best concepts Hollywood has ever come up with. I don't think they could ever remake this without ruining it and "Hollywoodizing" it, so I am glad it was made as well as it was the first time. The only movie so far that I have given 10 / 10

    I am shocked to see 7.8 rating for this nonsense movie. It was a totally disaster experience. And don't want to waste more time by writing detailed review of this crap movie. But since I am supposed to write minimum 10 lines, I'll write more. It is much worse than what we call in India "Khoda pahaad niklaa chuhaa". It means you built up so much expectation but in the end you just say it was a prank. The climax is least to say 'highly disappointing'. What's the use of having strong cast and actors, if the story is so silly? I think 'Matchstick Man' was far better movie on this theme, where everyone is acting out without the protagonist knowing it'. Really I have already wasted 100 minutes + 7 minutes (writing this review) for this movie.Now I Just hope to save your time.

    Nicholas Van Orton is a wealthy San Francisco banker, but he is a loner, even spending his birthday alone. On the year of his 48th birthday, the age his father committed suicide, his brother Conrad, who absconded long ago and surrendered to addictions of all kinds, returns and gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to an entertainment known as CRS. Giving up to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and weird and bad things start to happen to him..... It was going to be very difficult for Fincher to capture the magic he made with se7en, but my gosh, he gets really close with this under seen gem. This has probably got to be his most under seen work along with Zodiac, and its one of his most intriguing. Douglas plays this sort of role in his sleep, and Orton is not a million miles away from Gekko or the guy from A Perfect Murder, in other words, he plays the rich man effortlessly. Once the Game gets into full swing, it never really let's up until the end, and the viewer really has to suspend disbelief to gain full enjoyment of the movie, because if you start to question the movie, you will find all sorts of silly plot holes that could ruin the movie. You could see the movie almost as 'A Christmas Carol'. Orton is Scrooge, a lone man who doesn't accept gifts from family or friends, and after a revelation on his home one night, his life takes a turn. We see his childhood, and his present, and finally when Orton wakes up in the coffin, what his future has become. All in all, its a fascinating movie, really worth seeing, even if it does resemble a British mini-series from the eighties called 'the one game'

    This film is to the genre Mysteries what Raiders of the Lost Ark is to Action. From nearly the start, it is a slew of one mystery after another. Unfortunately, it is also no good. The mysteries come one after the other with little if any explanation as to *why* stuff happens. We are meant to be thrilled by each tidbit on its own. The one all-encompassing explanation comes at the end -- but we are expected to believe the many near-misses we experienced were all part of the design of the game. Yeah, right. Its a bit like the TV serial which decides to escape from a corner they have painted themselves in by revealing at the start of the next season that the previous season was just a dream.

    This is far from any birthday present you would ever want to forget. A wealthy investment banker receives a present from his wayward brother, Sean Penn, that is most memorable. Michael Douglas is the banker who really undergoes a life altering experience being subjected to this game. His life is literally turned upside down with everyone around him in on this sham, and it becomes pretty terrifying at that. Douglas certainly thinks that he is the victim here and you soon realize why there were early scenes that showed his father's suicide. Could Douglas possibly wind up the same way? This is a creepy, eerie film that makes one think about the order of things. It's nothing more than a scary story with a surprise ending.
