    There seems to be a split reaction from critics and audiences alike when talking about Henry Selick's 1996 stop-motion animated feature James and the Giant Peach. While the critics (particularly Gene Siskel) highly praise this picture and call it a wonderful children's fantasy, the audiences don't seem to care much for it maybe because it's too weird for them like many of the films made by Tim Burton, who is also one of the film's producers. Personally, I don't know what to make of this film even after seeing it plenty of times except that I can see where both sides are coming from. Before I delve into my own opinion regarding the pros and cons of this flick, let's look at the film's plot which was based on the children's story by Roald Dahl, who also wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. We follow a young British boy named James (Paul Terry) whose parents were killed by a rhinoceros (don't ask how or why since the picture never explains that). He is forced to live with his two despicable aunts (Miriam Margolyes, Joanna Lumley) where he has to do all kinds of chores (he practically does more work than those two ever seem to do in five seconds), and be humiliated in more ways than one. One day, a mysterious man (Pete Postlethwaite) who "knows more than just his name" gives James a bag of magical "crocodile tongues" which he claims will help put some happiness into his sad life. But when James accidentally lets these magical tongues loose, James and his aunts soon discover a peach on a dead tree that grows so gigantic that it's even bigger than the tree from which it grew on. The aunts plan on using their giant peach as a tourist attraction so they can make good profits off of their discovery, while James still has to continue doing chores. One night, James crawls inside a large hole in the peach and discovers a group of human-sized bugs including a grasshopper (Simon Callow), a centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), an earthworm (David Thewlis), a spider (Susan Sarandon), a ladybug (Jane Leeves), and a glowworm (Miriam Margolyes). Like James, they dream of getting out of his aunt's place in England and heading to New York City where his parents always dreamed of going. And that's exactly what they do through a series of elaborate, fanciful scenarios such as rolling away into the Atlantic Ocean, using Miss Spider's silk to capture and tie a hundred seagulls to the peach stem so the peach can fly, and battling a mechanical shark and skeleton pirates under the icy seas of the Arctic Ocean. Whether you like this children's fantasy or not, there are certain things about this picture that you got to give the film credit for. For one thing, regardless of how implausible the story can be most of the time, I do respect the creativity and the imagination that was incorporated into this story. I admire how this film had the courage to simply let its imagination run wild regardless of our skepticism and our knowledge that no such scenarios could take place in real life. The stop-motion animation is impressive in its own right particularly with the highly detailed and imaginative character designs. The voice-over work from the likes of Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, and Susan Sarandon are very well done and truly bring these characters to life. The songs by Randy Newman, with the exception of "My Name is James" which I thought had embarrassing lyrics, are pretty solid with the standouts being "Family" and "Good News". Like much of the best films made by the Disney Company, the strength of the film lies in the visuals and the audio. Now I will say that the storytelling in this film is not very consistent and is filled with major plot flaws that can't be glossed over. For example, I think that the film's writers made the aunt characters way too evil. If any parents of a child knew they had relatives who treated children the way these two aunts did, they should not have even allowed custody of the child to these people in the first place. Let me put this in another way, anyone who has relatives who taunt a child over the death of their parents or starve the child to death by feeding them non-food should not just simply pretend they don't exist, they need to have an intervention with them immediately for the benefit of the child. There are also some scenes that don't really go anywhere story wise. For example, the dream sequence with James as a caterpillar being chased by his aunts and the rhino that killed his parents is pretty pointless. To be fair though, there have been dream sequences in other films that are much worse than this, and they at least prepare us ahead of time for that type of scene. While the battles between the shark as well as the underwater skeleton pirates are decent, they both go by a little too quickly and neither leaves much of an impact. As long as you leave your common sense and logic out the door, James and the Giant Peach will fill the bill just fine as far as family entertainment goes. Kids and adults alike can admire the creativity of the story, the unique animation in the tradition of The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), the colorful characters including the centipede and the grasshopper, and maybe find one or two good tunes out of it as well. It's far from the Disney Company's greatest picture, but it's an interesting one at that.

    After The Nightmare Before Christmas, both Henry Selick and Tim Burton began work on another stop motion animated film, a film based on an acclaimed children's novel by British author Roald Dahl. James and The Giant Peach brings in a lot of the same elements as Nightmare, but also brings in many trademarks of it's own. This film brews live action scenes into the pot and is overall more brightly colored and sunny than Nightmare, whose scenes were mostly dark and night like. In my opinion, James and the Giant Peach is one of those films that constantly gets overlooked. While Nightmate gets a lot of recognition and fanatics, this film has a small cult following and when it comes to ranking the world's best stop motion classics, this one usually ranks low on the list or doesn't rank at all. It's a pity, because I think this is one of Selick and Burton's best accomplishments. As Roald Dahl hated the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory from 1971, I think he would have been quite proud of this picture, for it's one of those films that truly represents the mood, the look, and the imagination of the original novel. This film has some of Hollywood's finest either playing live action characters or stop motion characters. We have Miriam Margoyles and Joanna Lumley playing James' dreadful aunts, who are just as hilarious and silly looking as they are intimidating. Lumley's Aunt Spiker character can't go one scene without having her mouth hang wide open or giving off a evil smile, revealing her crooked, filthy teeth. Then there is Pete Postlewaite as the Magic Man who gives James a bag of crocodile tongues. He can have his creepy moments as well, but he overall plays the character as a mysterious figure. He's like the tinkerer from Willy Wonka. You just want to know more about him, but you can't because he's gone before you can wink. Playing James is Paul Terry, who's not known that much nowadays, but has appeared on CBBC's Microsoap series. He's a triumphant young man and his little singing number towards the beginning of the film really highlights his hopes and ambitions and desire to leave his nasty aunts. Playing the stop motion characters are a wide array of actors, actors like Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, even David Thewlis of Harry Potter fame. I think my favorite has got to be Dreyfuss' Centipede character, for he plays him as a slick, snarky, defiant Han Solo like character...with a cigar of course. My favorite scene out of the entire film is the scene depicting James and Centipede's adventure on a pirate ship under the sea. Many Nightmare Before Christmas fans know that this is the scene where the Jack Skellington puppet makes a cameo as the ship's deceased captain, and I think Selick and Burton did a fantastic job making him still retain his trademarks, but also look very different than the way him did in Nightmare. If I had to some up this film in one word, it's look. This film has a look unlike any other film. I said The Nightmare Before Christmas was like a mix between Rankin Bass' Rudolph and the works of Edward Gory, but I think this film combines the looks of Dr. Seuss with Nancy Ekholm Burkert, who illustrated Dahl's original book. Like in Nightmare, many things are rugged, crooked and crude, even the gleaming, sky scraping buildings of New York City. I also think the peach has quite an appeal to it. In several scenes, I just want to reach my hand into the screen and take a huge bite out of it. There is even a song about eating the peach present in the film, and Randy Newman must be praised for his excellent songwriting. James and the Giant Peach is a film that deserves a little more than what it gets. Sure, it's not my all time favorite, but I still hold it very close and love it, love it, love it, love it to pieces. If you want a film that combines stylized live action with fantastic stop motion sequences and odd, yet thrilling wizardry, this is your pot of tea.

    This movie is rotten like a spoiled peach. This pile of rotten apples was based on the book written by the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda, Roald Dahl. It is also directed by Henry Selick. So, why should I throw rotten peaches at the schmoes who made this crap? Read on and find out... The very first problem begins in the very first few minutes of the movie: the death of James' parents. According to the narrator, James' parents were eaten alive by a rhinoceros. Uh.... WHAT?!!! How do rhinos eat people?! Rhinoceri are herbivores not carnivores! I'm not kidding you, I didn't make this up! This is exactly what the narrator said about the death of James' parents. And afterwords, James becomes a ward for his two evil aunts. Call me crazy, but here's what really happened to James' parents: My guess is that James' evil aunts sneaked into the bedroom of James' parents and stabbed them to death out of extreme rage that James' parents are better than them. This is more realistic than "a rhino eating James' parents". Then, there's the songs. Listen how horrible the lyrics are! Randy Newman, you ought to be ashamed of yourself! You were one of my favorite composers! You composed the songs for the Toy Story movies, for god's sake! What was the matter with you?! This movie is so bad, the Nostalgia Critic was forced against his will making a "positive" review for this piece of crap. Pros: The artwork Cons: The songs, the CGI cloud effects, and the ridiculous explanation of how James' parents died.

    I remember when I was a kid and would slip in my Nightmare Before Christmas VHS tape, one of the trailers that was on it was James and the Giant Peach. I always wanted to see it, but my parents didn't buy the movie. I think because the film at the time had gotten Luke warm reviews, but over the years it seems like James and the Giant Peach got a cult following and an audience to boot. After all, we don't really get some of these great animated films that were from the 90's. Plus whenever there's a dark family film, a lot of parents tend to look down on it. I think today's parents have become a little too protective in my opinion. However, I had the opportunity to see the film yesterday and gladly watched it. I admit, my hopes were maybe a bit high, but I can see why the reviews were mixed on this one. James Henry Trotter is a young boy who lives with his parents by the sea. On James's birthday, they plan to go to New York City. However, his parents are later killed by a ghostly rhinoceros from the sky and finds himself living with his two cruel aunts, Spiker and Sponge. He is forced to work all day and they threaten him with beatings to keep him in line and taunt him about the mysterious rhino and other hazards if he tries to leave. While rescuing a spider from being squashed by his aunts, James meets a mysterious man with a bag of magic greens, which he gives to James to make his life better When James is returning to the house, he trips and the green beans escape into the ground. One peach is soon found on a withered old tree, and it grows. The aunts use the giant peach as an attraction, making lots of money as James watches from the house, not allowed to leave. That night, James is sent to pick up the garbage. While doing so, he grabs a chunk of the peach to eat. A large hole appears inside the peach and James ventures inside, were he finds and befriends a group of life-size anthropomorphic bugs who also dream of an ideal home and decide to travel to New York. I think if I saw this as a kid, I would've adored it. As an adult, I see that there scenes that lead to no where and there are some things that are not explained in the film that are explained in the book. I remember reading the book in elementary school and if you didn't read the book, I think you would be totally lost with the whole killer rhino ordeal. Also the aunts are so one note, first off, how is it this kid has the kindest parents in the world with the nastiest sisters who are extremely ugly and obviously hate kids? Yeah, I'm sure when the parents were writing their wills they said "Now, if something happens to us, who will take care of James""How about your parents who call and write letters daily and adore him?""No, I don't think they'll like him living with them""True, how about your 2 evil ugly sisters who hate him and love to beat him?""Perfect!". However, the animation is absolutely wonderful and really takes you back into Nightmare Before Christmas, in fact, there is even a cameo appearance by Jack Skeleton. The songs are charming and all of the characters are great too, even if not consistent. Like I don't get how the spider says she doesn't like socializing with anyone, but is clearly singing and dancing with them in the next scene without complaint. But for the kids, this is a great film that gives them hope to dream. I wish I would've seen it as a kid. But I still like it despite the flaws, considering that I think I'm just nitpicking at this point. I can understand why James and the Giant Peach found it's audience and where it will end up in the classics one day. 7/10

    I first saw this soon after it first came out, when I was about 11 or 12. I was really disappointed in it then - I couldn't get over all the changes from the book. Fifteen or so years later, I've rewatched it, having become familiar with Henry Selick's other work. And this time I really enjoyed it. The animation is high quality, despite being less ambitious than Selick's two other major films (the animated parts of James and the Giant Peach make up a film only about half the length of Coraline, and there aren't any of the huge crowds of characters that filled The Nightmare Before Christmas). The songs, however, are nowhere near as good as those of The Nightmare Before Christmas. The less said about James' solo song at the start of the film the better. The only really good song in the movie also happens to be the only one that takes its lyrics from a rhyme in Dahl's book. Now that this film has surprised me by being better than I remembered, despite its big changes from the book, perhaps I should give Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory another chance to do the same...

    A British orphan's, James Henry Trotter, dreams of emigrating to New York City are scuppered when his parents are killed surprisingly by a rhinoceros who appears 'from nowhere'. As a result, he is forced to live with his two spiteful aunts, Spiker & Sponge, who treat him like a labourer and feed him very bad food. One day, James receives a peach from a mysterious stranger. He explores the inside and enters in a strange world, which may lead to his dreams coming true again. James & The Giant Peach is based on Roald Dahl's weakest novel. Tim Burton and Henry Sellick's film adaption is a larger disappointment compared to the book. I, of course, mean no offence to them as their other films, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline prove a lot better than this garbage. Here are the reasons why James & The Giant Peach is toxic. What you, as a viewer, are analysing as you watch the film is a synopsis which is exactly the same as in the novel; completely random, lost and quite frankly, dumb. There is no reason why a rhino would eat a human being (or two as shown in the film), and in England as well. I'd probably understand if it was from a zoo, but that's where the characters belong. This brings me onto the next bad point; the acting. It is abysmal. There are too many repeated lines i.e. the aunts stating, 'Work, work, work' and lines such as 'How dare you disagree' said over and over again. Anybody who writes a screenplay needs to think carefully about the dialogue you use. Joanna Lumley was so much better as Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous and Victoria's mother in The Corpse Bride. But it's Paul Terry who makes a huge mess of the film. He overacts and quotes some of the worst lines in cinematic history. Even the songs cannot grow any excitement. Instead they include the most overrated melodies and over-repeated songs. That's The Life? It'll tire anybody sitting on a seat in a cinema and cause butt-ache. The songs are absolutely abysmal and the film is simply the worst to have been associated with Walt Disney Pictures (distributor), the second being the equally toxic Pocahontas, whose songs ain't as bad as on this. Good animation work though.

    Before we can go on a journey with the Giant Peach however, first Little James have to be orphaned. And he is, in a matter of fact voice-over that makes for a surprise element here. A bold way to get the plot in motion, and it works ! Many keep on wandering what or who that rhino was, that took the life of the parents just like that, on a whim. Well, anybody can be swept away by the rhino in the sky, or so the nasty aunties will have you believe anyway... The visuals are stunning, the dialogues are bubbling fizzing electrical fun and brought wonderfully and lovingly by a great cast, and direction is clear cut, sharp and focused. A lovely film, that makes you wonder what is Selnick & Burton and what's genuine Roald Dahl. A splendid film that makes you go out and want to read a great book (again). What more can we possibly ask of a peach? Hmmm, well ... about that Rhino in the stormy clouds ... Maybe ... If it's based in Britain, couldn't we tempt it to take a holiday somewhere in, say, Bora Bora or the Halls of Montezuma ? The English are quite accustomed to their climate, but their rhino gives us, here in the Lowlands, more than our share of rain and sleet too !!!

    I wanted to watch this movie for a while. There are not many around animated this way and I did love The Nightmare before Christmas and Coraline. So, I finally gave it a try. I was not particularly impressed. I found the story somehow bland and uninspiring. Also, any little moral message in it is basically lost in a number of events that I presume are supposed to be exciting but are rather dull. The songs are not really bad, although they don't save the film. Perhaps I'm just too old for this, although I still love other family films like the ones mentioned at the beginning. I find this film just OK, I wouldn't watch it again.

    James and the Giant Peach is a stop motion/live action adaptation of the late Roald Dahl's book in the early 60s when being transitioned into film (like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The BFG, The Witches, Matilda, and The Fantastic Mr. Fox) about a young boy named James, who climbs into the peach and meets anthropomorphic stop-motion insects and stumbles upon an adventure of a lifetime. Many critics and fans of Roald Dahl alike were amazed about how faithful this movie was to the book, but there are two problems that I do have with this adaptation. 1) The beginning was quite dark and might frighten younger kids along with other scenes. 2) The rhino in the sky and the scene where James battles it wasn't explained enough. That's it for the criticism. The positive aspects of this movie were excellent. The live action sets and the stop-motion animation have an astounding charm to the book. The character designs are pretty unique and the Jack Skellington cameo as the captain of the skeletons was amazing. The acting is very superb. The stop-motion insects were good, the two mean aunts named Spike and Sponge were tolerable, and the main character James is very likable. Even the action is very good. Music/songs written by Randy Newman (The Toy Story trilogy, The Princess and the Frog) were surprising good. Although not a masterpiece, James and the Giant Peach is an enjoyable family entertainment that stays faithful to the story from a great author. 8/10

    In the beginning, Roald Dahl wrote a book called, "James and the Giant Peach". In 1996, "James and the Giant Peach", was turned into a live-action/stop-motion animated film. The movie was directed by Henry Selick and produced by Tim Burton (They both worked on The Nightmare Before Christmas). This is one of my favorite movies. The story was good, the character's were likable, and the animation was great. It combines computer-animation with stop-motion animation. But what also make's this movie really great is Randy Newmans song's in the movie. They were fun and memorable. Overall, "James and the Giant Peach", is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. 5/5

The aunts plan on using their giant peach as a tourist attraction so they can make good profits off of their discovery, while James still has to continue doing chores. One night, James crawls inside a large hole in the peach and discovers a group of human-sized bugs including a grasshopper (Simon Callow), a centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), an earthworm (David Thewlis), a spider (Susan Sarandon), a ladybug (Jane Leeves), and a glowworm (Miriam Margolyes). Like James, they dream of getting out of his aunt's place in England and heading to New York City where his parents always dreamed of going. And that's exactly what they do through a series of elaborate, fanciful scenarios such as rolling away into the Atlantic Ocean, using Miss Spider's silk to capture and tie a hundred seagulls to the peach stem so the peach can fly, and battling a mechanical shark and skeleton pirates under the icy seas of the Arctic Ocean.

    After The Nightmare Before Christmas, both Henry Selick and Tim Burton began work on another stop motion animated film, a film based on an acclaimed children's novel by British author Roald Dahl. James and The Giant Peach brings in a lot of the same elements as Nightmare, but also brings in many trademarks of it's own. This film brews live action scenes into the pot and is overall more brightly colored and sunny than Nightmare, whose scenes were mostly dark and night like. In my opinion, James and the Giant Peach is one of those films that constantly gets overlooked. While Nightmate gets a lot of recognition and fanatics, this film has a small cult following and when it comes to ranking the world's best stop motion classics, this one usually ranks low on the list or doesn't rank at all. It's a pity, because I think this is one of Selick and Burton's best accomplishments. As Roald Dahl hated the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory from 1971, I think he would have been quite proud of this picture, for it's one of those films that truly represents the mood, the look, and the imagination of the original novel. This film has some of Hollywood's finest either playing live action characters or stop motion characters. We have Miriam Margoyles and Joanna Lumley playing James' dreadful aunts, who are just as hilarious and silly looking as they are intimidating. Lumley's Aunt Spiker character can't go one scene without having her mouth hang wide open or giving off a evil smile, revealing her crooked, filthy teeth. Then there is Pete Postlewaite as the Magic Man who gives James a bag of crocodile tongues. He can have his creepy moments as well, but he overall plays the character as a mysterious figure. He's like the tinkerer from Willy Wonka. You just want to know more about him, but you can't because he's gone before you can wink. Playing James is Paul Terry, who's not known that much nowadays, but has appeared on CBBC's Microsoap series. He's a triumphant young man and his little singing number towards the beginning of the film really highlights his hopes and ambitions and desire to leave his nasty aunts. Playing the stop motion characters are a wide array of actors, actors like Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, even David Thewlis of Harry Potter fame. I think my favorite has got to be Dreyfuss' Centipede character, for he plays him as a slick, snarky, defiant Han Solo like character...with a cigar of course. My favorite scene out of the entire film is the scene depicting James and Centipede's adventure on a pirate ship under the sea. Many Nightmare Before Christmas fans know that this is the scene where the Jack Skellington puppet makes a cameo as the ship's deceased captain, and I think Selick and Burton did a fantastic job making him still retain his trademarks, but also look very different than the way him did in Nightmare. If I had to some up this film in one word, it's look. This film has a look unlike any other film. I said The Nightmare Before Christmas was like a mix between Rankin Bass' Rudolph and the works of Edward Gory, but I think this film combines the looks of Dr. Seuss with Nancy Ekholm Burkert, who illustrated Dahl's original book. Like in Nightmare, many things are rugged, crooked and crude, even the gleaming, sky scraping buildings of New York City. I also think the peach has quite an appeal to it. In several scenes, I just want to reach my hand into the screen and take a huge bite out of it. There is even a song about eating the peach present in the film, and Randy Newman must be praised for his excellent songwriting. James and the Giant Peach is a film that deserves a little more than what it gets. Sure, it's not my all time favorite, but I still hold it very close and love it, love it, love it, love it to pieces. If you want a film that combines stylized live action with fantastic stop motion sequences and odd, yet thrilling wizardry, this is your pot of tea.

    This movie is rotten like a spoiled peach. This pile of rotten apples was based on the book written by the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda, Roald Dahl. It is also directed by Henry Selick. So, why should I throw rotten peaches at the schmoes who made this crap? Read on and find out... The very first problem begins in the very first few minutes of the movie: the death of James' parents. According to the narrator, James' parents were eaten alive by a rhinoceros. Uh.... WHAT?!!! How do rhinos eat people?! Rhinoceri are herbivores not carnivores! I'm not kidding you, I didn't make this up! This is exactly what the narrator said about the death of James' parents. And afterwords, James becomes a ward for his two evil aunts. Call me crazy, but here's what really happened to James' parents: My guess is that James' evil aunts sneaked into the bedroom of James' parents and stabbed them to death out of extreme rage that James' parents are better than them. This is more realistic than "a rhino eating James' parents". Then, there's the songs. Listen how horrible the lyrics are! Randy Newman, you ought to be ashamed of yourself! You were one of my favorite composers! You composed the songs for the Toy Story movies, for god's sake! What was the matter with you?! This movie is so bad, the Nostalgia Critic was forced against his will making a "positive" review for this piece of crap. Pros: The artwork Cons: The songs, the CGI cloud effects, and the ridiculous explanation of how James' parents died.

    I remember when I was a kid and would slip in my Nightmare Before Christmas VHS tape, one of the trailers that was on it was James and the Giant Peach. I always wanted to see it, but my parents didn't buy the movie. I think because the film at the time had gotten Luke warm reviews, but over the years it seems like James and the Giant Peach got a cult following and an audience to boot. After all, we don't really get some of these great animated films that were from the 90's. Plus whenever there's a dark family film, a lot of parents tend to look down on it. I think today's parents have become a little too protective in my opinion. However, I had the opportunity to see the film yesterday and gladly watched it. I admit, my hopes were maybe a bit high, but I can see why the reviews were mixed on this one. James Henry Trotter is a young boy who lives with his parents by the sea. On James's birthday, they plan to go to New York City. However, his parents are later killed by a ghostly rhinoceros from the sky and finds himself living with his two cruel aunts, Spiker and Sponge. He is forced to work all day and they threaten him with beatings to keep him in line and taunt him about the mysterious rhino and other hazards if he tries to leave. While rescuing a spider from being squashed by his aunts, James meets a mysterious man with a bag of magic greens, which he gives to James to make his life better When James is returning to the house, he trips and the green beans escape into the ground. One peach is soon found on a withered old tree, and it grows. The aunts use the giant peach as an attraction, making lots of money as James watches from the house, not allowed to leave. That night, James is sent to pick up the garbage. While doing so, he grabs a chunk of the peach to eat. A large hole appears inside the peach and James ventures inside, were he finds and befriends a group of life-size anthropomorphic bugs who also dream of an ideal home and decide to travel to New York. I think if I saw this as a kid, I would've adored it. As an adult, I see that there scenes that lead to no where and there are some things that are not explained in the film that are explained in the book. I remember reading the book in elementary school and if you didn't read the book, I think you would be totally lost with the whole killer rhino ordeal. Also the aunts are so one note, first off, how is it this kid has the kindest parents in the world with the nastiest sisters who are extremely ugly and obviously hate kids? Yeah, I'm sure when the parents were writing their wills they said "Now, if something happens to us, who will take care of James""How about your parents who call and write letters daily and adore him?""No, I don't think they'll like him living with them""True, how about your 2 evil ugly sisters who hate him and love to beat him?""Perfect!". However, the animation is absolutely wonderful and really takes you back into Nightmare Before Christmas, in fact, there is even a cameo appearance by Jack Skeleton. The songs are charming and all of the characters are great too, even if not consistent. Like I don't get how the spider says she doesn't like socializing with anyone, but is clearly singing and dancing with them in the next scene without complaint. But for the kids, this is a great film that gives them hope to dream. I wish I would've seen it as a kid. But I still like it despite the flaws, considering that I think I'm just nitpicking at this point. I can understand why James and the Giant Peach found it's audience and where it will end up in the classics one day. 7/10

    I first saw this soon after it first came out, when I was about 11 or 12. I was really disappointed in it then - I couldn't get over all the changes from the book. Fifteen or so years later, I've rewatched it, having become familiar with Henry Selick's other work. And this time I really enjoyed it. The animation is high quality, despite being less ambitious than Selick's two other major films (the animated parts of James and the Giant Peach make up a film only about half the length of Coraline, and there aren't any of the huge crowds of characters that filled The Nightmare Before Christmas). The songs, however, are nowhere near as good as those of The Nightmare Before Christmas. The less said about James' solo song at the start of the film the better. The only really good song in the movie also happens to be the only one that takes its lyrics from a rhyme in Dahl's book. Now that this film has surprised me by being better than I remembered, despite its big changes from the book, perhaps I should give Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory another chance to do the same...

    A British orphan's, James Henry Trotter, dreams of emigrating to New York City are scuppered when his parents are killed surprisingly by a rhinoceros who appears 'from nowhere'. As a result, he is forced to live with his two spiteful aunts, Spiker & Sponge, who treat him like a labourer and feed him very bad food. One day, James receives a peach from a mysterious stranger. He explores the inside and enters in a strange world, which may lead to his dreams coming true again. James & The Giant Peach is based on Roald Dahl's weakest novel. Tim Burton and Henry Sellick's film adaption is a larger disappointment compared to the book. I, of course, mean no offence to them as their other films, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline prove a lot better than this garbage. Here are the reasons why James & The Giant Peach is toxic. What you, as a viewer, are analysing as you watch the film is a synopsis which is exactly the same as in the novel; completely random, lost and quite frankly, dumb. There is no reason why a rhino would eat a human being (or two as shown in the film), and in England as well. I'd probably understand if it was from a zoo, but that's where the characters belong. This brings me onto the next bad point; the acting. It is abysmal. There are too many repeated lines i.e. the aunts stating, 'Work, work, work' and lines such as 'How dare you disagree' said over and over again. Anybody who writes a screenplay needs to think carefully about the dialogue you use. Joanna Lumley was so much better as Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous and Victoria's mother in The Corpse Bride. But it's Paul Terry who makes a huge mess of the film. He overacts and quotes some of the worst lines in cinematic history. Even the songs cannot grow any excitement. Instead they include the most overrated melodies and over-repeated songs. That's The Life? It'll tire anybody sitting on a seat in a cinema and cause butt-ache. The songs are absolutely abysmal and the film is simply the worst to have been associated with Walt Disney Pictures (distributor), the second being the equally toxic Pocahontas, whose songs ain't as bad as on this. Good animation work though.

    Before we can go on a journey with the Giant Peach however, first Little James have to be orphaned. And he is, in a matter of fact voice-over that makes for a surprise element here. A bold way to get the plot in motion, and it works ! Many keep on wandering what or who that rhino was, that took the life of the parents just like that, on a whim. Well, anybody can be swept away by the rhino in the sky, or so the nasty aunties will have you believe anyway... The visuals are stunning, the dialogues are bubbling fizzing electrical fun and brought wonderfully and lovingly by a great cast, and direction is clear cut, sharp and focused. A lovely film, that makes you wonder what is Selnick & Burton and what's genuine Roald Dahl. A splendid film that makes you go out and want to read a great book (again). What more can we possibly ask of a peach? Hmmm, well ... about that Rhino in the stormy clouds ... Maybe ... If it's based in Britain, couldn't we tempt it to take a holiday somewhere in, say, Bora Bora or the Halls of Montezuma ? The English are quite accustomed to their climate, but their rhino gives us, here in the Lowlands, more than our share of rain and sleet too !!!

    I wanted to watch this movie for a while. There are not many around animated this way and I did love The Nightmare before Christmas and Coraline. So, I finally gave it a try. I was not particularly impressed. I found the story somehow bland and uninspiring. Also, any little moral message in it is basically lost in a number of events that I presume are supposed to be exciting but are rather dull. The songs are not really bad, although they don't save the film. Perhaps I'm just too old for this, although I still love other family films like the ones mentioned at the beginning. I find this film just OK, I wouldn't watch it again.

    James and the Giant Peach is a stop motion/live action adaptation of the late Roald Dahl's book in the early 60s when being transitioned into film (like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The BFG, The Witches, Matilda, and The Fantastic Mr. Fox) about a young boy named James, who climbs into the peach and meets anthropomorphic stop-motion insects and stumbles upon an adventure of a lifetime. Many critics and fans of Roald Dahl alike were amazed about how faithful this movie was to the book, but there are two problems that I do have with this adaptation. 1) The beginning was quite dark and might frighten younger kids along with other scenes. 2) The rhino in the sky and the scene where James battles it wasn't explained enough. That's it for the criticism. The positive aspects of this movie were excellent. The live action sets and the stop-motion animation have an astounding charm to the book. The character designs are pretty unique and the Jack Skellington cameo as the captain of the skeletons was amazing. The acting is very superb. The stop-motion insects were good, the two mean aunts named Spike and Sponge were tolerable, and the main character James is very likable. Even the action is very good. Music/songs written by Randy Newman (The Toy Story trilogy, The Princess and the Frog) were surprising good. Although not a masterpiece, James and the Giant Peach is an enjoyable family entertainment that stays faithful to the story from a great author. 8/10

    In the beginning, Roald Dahl wrote a book called, "James and the Giant Peach". In 1996, "James and the Giant Peach", was turned into a live-action/stop-motion animated film. The movie was directed by Henry Selick and produced by Tim Burton (They both worked on The Nightmare Before Christmas). This is one of my favorite movies. The story was good, the character's were likable, and the animation was great. It combines computer-animation with stop-motion animation. But what also make's this movie really great is Randy Newmans song's in the movie. They were fun and memorable. Overall, "James and the Giant Peach", is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. 5/5

    There seems to be a split reaction from critics and audiences alike when talking about Henry Selick's 1996 stop-motion animated feature James and the Giant Peach. While the critics (particularly Gene Siskel) highly praise this picture and call it a wonderful children's fantasy, the audiences don't seem to care much for it maybe because it's too weird for them like many of the films made by Tim Burton, who is also one of the film's producers. Personally, I don't know what to make of this film even after seeing it plenty of times except that I can see where both sides are coming from. Before I delve into my own opinion regarding the pros and cons of this flick, let's look at the film's plot which was based on the children's story by Roald Dahl, who also wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. We follow a young British boy named James (Paul Terry) whose parents were killed by a rhinoceros (don't ask how or why since the picture never explains that). He is forced to live with his two despicable aunts (Miriam Margolyes, Joanna Lumley) where he has to do all kinds of chores (he practically does more work than those two ever seem to do in five seconds), and be humiliated in more ways than one. One day, a mysterious man (Pete Postlethwaite) who "knows more than just his name" gives James a bag of magical "crocodile tongues" which he claims will help put some happiness into his sad life. But when James accidentally lets these magical tongues loose, James and his aunts soon discover a peach on a dead tree that grows so gigantic that it's even bigger than the tree from which it grew on. The aunts plan on using their giant peach as a tourist attraction so they can make good profits off of their discovery, while James still has to continue doing chores. One night, James crawls inside a large hole in the peach and discovers a group of human-sized bugs including a grasshopper (Simon Callow), a centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), an earthworm (David Thewlis), a spider (Susan Sarandon), a ladybug (Jane Leeves), and a glowworm (Miriam Margolyes). Like James, they dream of getting out of his aunt's place in England and heading to New York City where his parents always dreamed of going. And that's exactly what they do through a series of elaborate, fanciful scenarios such as rolling away into the Atlantic Ocean, using Miss Spider's silk to capture and tie a hundred seagulls to the peach stem so the peach can fly, and battling a mechanical shark and skeleton pirates under the icy seas of the Arctic Ocean. Whether you like this children's fantasy or not, there are certain things about this picture that you got to give the film credit for. For one thing, regardless of how implausible the story can be most of the time, I do respect the creativity and the imagination that was incorporated into this story. I admire how this film had the courage to simply let its imagination run wild regardless of our skepticism and our knowledge that no such scenarios could take place in real life. The stop-motion animation is impressive in its own right particularly with the highly detailed and imaginative character designs. The voice-over work from the likes of Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, and Susan Sarandon are very well done and truly bring these characters to life. The songs by Randy Newman, with the exception of "My Name is James" which I thought had embarrassing lyrics, are pretty solid with the standouts being "Family" and "Good News". Like much of the best films made by the Disney Company, the strength of the film lies in the visuals and the audio. Now I will say that the storytelling in this film is not very consistent and is filled with major plot flaws that can't be glossed over. For example, I think that the film's writers made the aunt characters way too evil. If any parents of a child knew they had relatives who treated children the way these two aunts did, they should not have even allowed custody of the child to these people in the first place. Let me put this in another way, anyone who has relatives who taunt a child over the death of their parents or starve the child to death by feeding them non-food should not just simply pretend they don't exist, they need to have an intervention with them immediately for the benefit of the child. There are also some scenes that don't really go anywhere story wise. For example, the dream sequence with James as a caterpillar being chased by his aunts and the rhino that killed his parents is pretty pointless. To be fair though, there have been dream sequences in other films that are much worse than this, and they at least prepare us ahead of time for that type of scene. While the battles between the shark as well as the underwater skeleton pirates are decent, they both go by a little too quickly and neither leaves much of an impact. As long as you leave your common sense and logic out the door, James and the Giant Peach will fill the bill just fine as far as family entertainment goes. Kids and adults alike can admire the creativity of the story, the unique animation in the tradition of The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), the colorful characters including the centipede and the grasshopper, and maybe find one or two good tunes out of it as well. It's far from the Disney Company's greatest picture, but it's an interesting one at that.

As an adult, I see that there scenes that lead to no where and there are some things that are not explained in the film that are explained in the book. I remember reading the book in elementary school and if you didn't read the book, I think you would be totally lost with the whole killer rhino ordeal. Also the aunts are so one note, first off, how is it this kid has the kindest parents in the world with the nastiest sisters who are extremely ugly and obviously hate kids? Yeah, I'm sure when the parents were writing their wills they said "Now, if something happens to us, who will take care of James""How about your parents who call and write letters daily and adore him?""No, I don't think they'll like him living with them""True, how about your 2 evil ugly sisters who hate him and love to beat him?""Perfect!". However, the animation is absolutely wonderful and really takes you back into Nightmare Before Christmas, in fact, there is even a cameo appearance by Jack Skeleton. The songs are charming and all of the characters are great too, even if not consistent. Like I don't get how the spider says she doesn't like socializing with anyone, but is clearly singing and dancing with them in the next scene without complaint. But for the kids, this is a great film that gives them hope to dream. I wish I would've seen it as a kid. But I still like it despite the flaws, considering that I think I'm just nitpicking at this point. I can understand why James and the Giant Peach found it's audience and where it will end up in the classics one day. 7/10

    I first saw this soon after it first came out, when I was about 11 or 12. I was really disappointed in it then - I couldn't get over all the changes from the book. Fifteen or so years later, I've rewatched it, having become familiar with Henry Selick's other work. And this time I really enjoyed it. The animation is high quality, despite being less ambitious than Selick's two other major films (the animated parts of James and the Giant Peach make up a film only about half the length of Coraline, and there aren't any of the huge crowds of characters that filled The Nightmare Before Christmas). The songs, however, are nowhere near as good as those of The Nightmare Before Christmas. The less said about James' solo song at the start of the film the better. The only really good song in the movie also happens to be the only one that takes its lyrics from a rhyme in Dahl's book. Now that this film has surprised me by being better than I remembered, despite its big changes from the book, perhaps I should give Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory another chance to do the same...

    A British orphan's, James Henry Trotter, dreams of emigrating to New York City are scuppered when his parents are killed surprisingly by a rhinoceros who appears 'from nowhere'. As a result, he is forced to live with his two spiteful aunts, Spiker & Sponge, who treat him like a labourer and feed him very bad food. One day, James receives a peach from a mysterious stranger. He explores the inside and enters in a strange world, which may lead to his dreams coming true again. James & The Giant Peach is based on Roald Dahl's weakest novel. Tim Burton and Henry Sellick's film adaption is a larger disappointment compared to the book. I, of course, mean no offence to them as their other films, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline prove a lot better than this garbage. Here are the reasons why James & The Giant Peach is toxic. What you, as a viewer, are analysing as you watch the film is a synopsis which is exactly the same as in the novel; completely random, lost and quite frankly, dumb. There is no reason why a rhino would eat a human being (or two as shown in the film), and in England as well. I'd probably understand if it was from a zoo, but that's where the characters belong. This brings me onto the next bad point; the acting. It is abysmal. There are too many repeated lines i.e. the aunts stating, 'Work, work, work' and lines such as 'How dare you disagree' said over and over again. Anybody who writes a screenplay needs to think carefully about the dialogue you use. Joanna Lumley was so much better as Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous and Victoria's mother in The Corpse Bride. But it's Paul Terry who makes a huge mess of the film. He overacts and quotes some of the worst lines in cinematic history. Even the songs cannot grow any excitement. Instead they include the most overrated melodies and over-repeated songs. That's The Life? It'll tire anybody sitting on a seat in a cinema and cause butt-ache. The songs are absolutely abysmal and the film is simply the worst to have been associated with Walt Disney Pictures (distributor), the second being the equally toxic Pocahontas, whose songs ain't as bad as on this. Good animation work though.

    Before we can go on a journey with the Giant Peach however, first Little James have to be orphaned. And he is, in a matter of fact voice-over that makes for a surprise element here. A bold way to get the plot in motion, and it works ! Many keep on wandering what or who that rhino was, that took the life of the parents just like that, on a whim. Well, anybody can be swept away by the rhino in the sky, or so the nasty aunties will have you believe anyway... The visuals are stunning, the dialogues are bubbling fizzing electrical fun and brought wonderfully and lovingly by a great cast, and direction is clear cut, sharp and focused. A lovely film, that makes you wonder what is Selnick & Burton and what's genuine Roald Dahl. A splendid film that makes you go out and want to read a great book (again). What more can we possibly ask of a peach? Hmmm, well ... about that Rhino in the stormy clouds ... Maybe ... If it's based in Britain, couldn't we tempt it to take a holiday somewhere in, say, Bora Bora or the Halls of Montezuma ? The English are quite accustomed to their climate, but their rhino gives us, here in the Lowlands, more than our share of rain and sleet too !!!

    I wanted to watch this movie for a while. There are not many around animated this way and I did love The Nightmare before Christmas and Coraline. So, I finally gave it a try. I was not particularly impressed. I found the story somehow bland and uninspiring. Also, any little moral message in it is basically lost in a number of events that I presume are supposed to be exciting but are rather dull. The songs are not really bad, although they don't save the film. Perhaps I'm just too old for this, although I still love other family films like the ones mentioned at the beginning. I find this film just OK, I wouldn't watch it again.

    James and the Giant Peach is a stop motion/live action adaptation of the late Roald Dahl's book in the early 60s when being transitioned into film (like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The BFG, The Witches, Matilda, and The Fantastic Mr. Fox) about a young boy named James, who climbs into the peach and meets anthropomorphic stop-motion insects and stumbles upon an adventure of a lifetime. Many critics and fans of Roald Dahl alike were amazed about how faithful this movie was to the book, but there are two problems that I do have with this adaptation. 1) The beginning was quite dark and might frighten younger kids along with other scenes. 2) The rhino in the sky and the scene where James battles it wasn't explained enough. That's it for the criticism. The positive aspects of this movie were excellent. The live action sets and the stop-motion animation have an astounding charm to the book. The character designs are pretty unique and the Jack Skellington cameo as the captain of the skeletons was amazing. The acting is very superb. The stop-motion insects were good, the two mean aunts named Spike and Sponge were tolerable, and the main character James is very likable. Even the action is very good. Music/songs written by Randy Newman (The Toy Story trilogy, The Princess and the Frog) were surprising good. Although not a masterpiece, James and the Giant Peach is an enjoyable family entertainment that stays faithful to the story from a great author. 8/10

    In the beginning, Roald Dahl wrote a book called, "James and the Giant Peach". In 1996, "James and the Giant Peach", was turned into a live-action/stop-motion animated film. The movie was directed by Henry Selick and produced by Tim Burton (They both worked on The Nightmare Before Christmas). This is one of my favorite movies. The story was good, the character's were likable, and the animation was great. It combines computer-animation with stop-motion animation. But what also make's this movie really great is Randy Newmans song's in the movie. They were fun and memorable. Overall, "James and the Giant Peach", is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. 5/5

    There seems to be a split reaction from critics and audiences alike when talking about Henry Selick's 1996 stop-motion animated feature James and the Giant Peach. While the critics (particularly Gene Siskel) highly praise this picture and call it a wonderful children's fantasy, the audiences don't seem to care much for it maybe because it's too weird for them like many of the films made by Tim Burton, who is also one of the film's producers. Personally, I don't know what to make of this film even after seeing it plenty of times except that I can see where both sides are coming from. Before I delve into my own opinion regarding the pros and cons of this flick, let's look at the film's plot which was based on the children's story by Roald Dahl, who also wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. We follow a young British boy named James (Paul Terry) whose parents were killed by a rhinoceros (don't ask how or why since the picture never explains that). He is forced to live with his two despicable aunts (Miriam Margolyes, Joanna Lumley) where he has to do all kinds of chores (he practically does more work than those two ever seem to do in five seconds), and be humiliated in more ways than one. One day, a mysterious man (Pete Postlethwaite) who "knows more than just his name" gives James a bag of magical "crocodile tongues" which he claims will help put some happiness into his sad life. But when James accidentally lets these magical tongues loose, James and his aunts soon discover a peach on a dead tree that grows so gigantic that it's even bigger than the tree from which it grew on. The aunts plan on using their giant peach as a tourist attraction so they can make good profits off of their discovery, while James still has to continue doing chores. One night, James crawls inside a large hole in the peach and discovers a group of human-sized bugs including a grasshopper (Simon Callow), a centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), an earthworm (David Thewlis), a spider (Susan Sarandon), a ladybug (Jane Leeves), and a glowworm (Miriam Margolyes). Like James, they dream of getting out of his aunt's place in England and heading to New York City where his parents always dreamed of going. And that's exactly what they do through a series of elaborate, fanciful scenarios such as rolling away into the Atlantic Ocean, using Miss Spider's silk to capture and tie a hundred seagulls to the peach stem so the peach can fly, and battling a mechanical shark and skeleton pirates under the icy seas of the Arctic Ocean. Whether you like this children's fantasy or not, there are certain things about this picture that you got to give the film credit for. For one thing, regardless of how implausible the story can be most of the time, I do respect the creativity and the imagination that was incorporated into this story. I admire how this film had the courage to simply let its imagination run wild regardless of our skepticism and our knowledge that no such scenarios could take place in real life. The stop-motion animation is impressive in its own right particularly with the highly detailed and imaginative character designs. The voice-over work from the likes of Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, and Susan Sarandon are very well done and truly bring these characters to life. The songs by Randy Newman, with the exception of "My Name is James" which I thought had embarrassing lyrics, are pretty solid with the standouts being "Family" and "Good News". Like much of the best films made by the Disney Company, the strength of the film lies in the visuals and the audio. Now I will say that the storytelling in this film is not very consistent and is filled with major plot flaws that can't be glossed over. For example, I think that the film's writers made the aunt characters way too evil. If any parents of a child knew they had relatives who treated children the way these two aunts did, they should not have even allowed custody of the child to these people in the first place. Let me put this in another way, anyone who has relatives who taunt a child over the death of their parents or starve the child to death by feeding them non-food should not just simply pretend they don't exist, they need to have an intervention with them immediately for the benefit of the child. There are also some scenes that don't really go anywhere story wise. For example, the dream sequence with James as a caterpillar being chased by his aunts and the rhino that killed his parents is pretty pointless. To be fair though, there have been dream sequences in other films that are much worse than this, and they at least prepare us ahead of time for that type of scene. While the battles between the shark as well as the underwater skeleton pirates are decent, they both go by a little too quickly and neither leaves much of an impact. As long as you leave your common sense and logic out the door, James and the Giant Peach will fill the bill just fine as far as family entertainment goes. Kids and adults alike can admire the creativity of the story, the unique animation in the tradition of The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), the colorful characters including the centipede and the grasshopper, and maybe find one or two good tunes out of it as well. It's far from the Disney Company's greatest picture, but it's an interesting one at that.

    After The Nightmare Before Christmas, both Henry Selick and Tim Burton began work on another stop motion animated film, a film based on an acclaimed children's novel by British author Roald Dahl. James and The Giant Peach brings in a lot of the same elements as Nightmare, but also brings in many trademarks of it's own. This film brews live action scenes into the pot and is overall more brightly colored and sunny than Nightmare, whose scenes were mostly dark and night like. In my opinion, James and the Giant Peach is one of those films that constantly gets overlooked. While Nightmate gets a lot of recognition and fanatics, this film has a small cult following and when it comes to ranking the world's best stop motion classics, this one usually ranks low on the list or doesn't rank at all. It's a pity, because I think this is one of Selick and Burton's best accomplishments. As Roald Dahl hated the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory from 1971, I think he would have been quite proud of this picture, for it's one of those films that truly represents the mood, the look, and the imagination of the original novel. This film has some of Hollywood's finest either playing live action characters or stop motion characters. We have Miriam Margoyles and Joanna Lumley playing James' dreadful aunts, who are just as hilarious and silly looking as they are intimidating. Lumley's Aunt Spiker character can't go one scene without having her mouth hang wide open or giving off a evil smile, revealing her crooked, filthy teeth. Then there is Pete Postlewaite as the Magic Man who gives James a bag of crocodile tongues. He can have his creepy moments as well, but he overall plays the character as a mysterious figure. He's like the tinkerer from Willy Wonka. You just want to know more about him, but you can't because he's gone before you can wink. Playing James is Paul Terry, who's not known that much nowadays, but has appeared on CBBC's Microsoap series. He's a triumphant young man and his little singing number towards the beginning of the film really highlights his hopes and ambitions and desire to leave his nasty aunts. Playing the stop motion characters are a wide array of actors, actors like Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, even David Thewlis of Harry Potter fame. I think my favorite has got to be Dreyfuss' Centipede character, for he plays him as a slick, snarky, defiant Han Solo like character...with a cigar of course. My favorite scene out of the entire film is the scene depicting James and Centipede's adventure on a pirate ship under the sea. Many Nightmare Before Christmas fans know that this is the scene where the Jack Skellington puppet makes a cameo as the ship's deceased captain, and I think Selick and Burton did a fantastic job making him still retain his trademarks, but also look very different than the way him did in Nightmare. If I had to some up this film in one word, it's look. This film has a look unlike any other film. I said The Nightmare Before Christmas was like a mix between Rankin Bass' Rudolph and the works of Edward Gory, but I think this film combines the looks of Dr. Seuss with Nancy Ekholm Burkert, who illustrated Dahl's original book. Like in Nightmare, many things are rugged, crooked and crude, even the gleaming, sky scraping buildings of New York City. I also think the peach has quite an appeal to it. In several scenes, I just want to reach my hand into the screen and take a huge bite out of it. There is even a song about eating the peach present in the film, and Randy Newman must be praised for his excellent songwriting. James and the Giant Peach is a film that deserves a little more than what it gets. Sure, it's not my all time favorite, but I still hold it very close and love it, love it, love it, love it to pieces. If you want a film that combines stylized live action with fantastic stop motion sequences and odd, yet thrilling wizardry, this is your pot of tea.

    This movie is rotten like a spoiled peach. This pile of rotten apples was based on the book written by the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda, Roald Dahl. It is also directed by Henry Selick. So, why should I throw rotten peaches at the schmoes who made this crap? Read on and find out... The very first problem begins in the very first few minutes of the movie: the death of James' parents. According to the narrator, James' parents were eaten alive by a rhinoceros. Uh.... WHAT?!!! How do rhinos eat people?! Rhinoceri are herbivores not carnivores! I'm not kidding you, I didn't make this up! This is exactly what the narrator said about the death of James' parents. And afterwords, James becomes a ward for his two evil aunts. Call me crazy, but here's what really happened to James' parents: My guess is that James' evil aunts sneaked into the bedroom of James' parents and stabbed them to death out of extreme rage that James' parents are better than them. This is more realistic than "a rhino eating James' parents". Then, there's the songs. Listen how horrible the lyrics are! Randy Newman, you ought to be ashamed of yourself! You were one of my favorite composers! You composed the songs for the Toy Story movies, for god's sake! What was the matter with you?! This movie is so bad, the Nostalgia Critic was forced against his will making a "positive" review for this piece of crap. Pros: The artwork Cons: The songs, the CGI cloud effects, and the ridiculous explanation of how James' parents died.

    I remember when I was a kid and would slip in my Nightmare Before Christmas VHS tape, one of the trailers that was on it was James and the Giant Peach. I always wanted to see it, but my parents didn't buy the movie. I think because the film at the time had gotten Luke warm reviews, but over the years it seems like James and the Giant Peach got a cult following and an audience to boot. After all, we don't really get some of these great animated films that were from the 90's. Plus whenever there's a dark family film, a lot of parents tend to look down on it. I think today's parents have become a little too protective in my opinion. However, I had the opportunity to see the film yesterday and gladly watched it. I admit, my hopes were maybe a bit high, but I can see why the reviews were mixed on this one. James Henry Trotter is a young boy who lives with his parents by the sea. On James's birthday, they plan to go to New York City. However, his parents are later killed by a ghostly rhinoceros from the sky and finds himself living with his two cruel aunts, Spiker and Sponge. He is forced to work all day and they threaten him with beatings to keep him in line and taunt him about the mysterious rhino and other hazards if he tries to leave. While rescuing a spider from being squashed by his aunts, James meets a mysterious man with a bag of magic greens, which he gives to James to make his life better When James is returning to the house, he trips and the green beans escape into the ground. One peach is soon found on a withered old tree, and it grows. The aunts use the giant peach as an attraction, making lots of money as James watches from the house, not allowed to leave. That night, James is sent to pick up the garbage. While doing so, he grabs a chunk of the peach to eat. A large hole appears inside the peach and James ventures inside, were he finds and befriends a group of life-size anthropomorphic bugs who also dream of an ideal home and decide to travel to New York. I think if I saw this as a kid, I would've adored it. As an adult, I see that there scenes that lead to no where and there are some things that are not explained in the film that are explained in the book. I remember reading the book in elementary school and if you didn't read the book, I think you would be totally lost with the whole killer rhino ordeal. Also the aunts are so one note, first off, how is it this kid has the kindest parents in the world with the nastiest sisters who are extremely ugly and obviously hate kids? Yeah, I'm sure when the parents were writing their wills they said "Now, if something happens to us, who will take care of James""How about your parents who call and write letters daily and adore him?""No, I don't think they'll like him living with them""True, how about your 2 evil ugly sisters who hate him and love to beat him?""Perfect!". However, the animation is absolutely wonderful and really takes you back into Nightmare Before Christmas, in fact, there is even a cameo appearance by Jack Skeleton. The songs are charming and all of the characters are great too, even if not consistent. Like I don't get how the spider says she doesn't like socializing with anyone, but is clearly singing and dancing with them in the next scene without complaint. But for the kids, this is a great film that gives them hope to dream. I wish I would've seen it as a kid. But I still like it despite the flaws, considering that I think I'm just nitpicking at this point. I can understand why James and the Giant Peach found it's audience and where it will end up in the classics one day. 7/10

The songs are not really bad, although they don't save the film. Perhaps I'm just too old for this, although I still love other family films like the ones mentioned at the beginning. I find this film just OK, I wouldn't watch it again.

    James and the Giant Peach is a stop motion/live action adaptation of the late Roald Dahl's book in the early 60s when being transitioned into film (like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The BFG, The Witches, Matilda, and The Fantastic Mr. Fox) about a young boy named James, who climbs into the peach and meets anthropomorphic stop-motion insects and stumbles upon an adventure of a lifetime. Many critics and fans of Roald Dahl alike were amazed about how faithful this movie was to the book, but there are two problems that I do have with this adaptation. 1) The beginning was quite dark and might frighten younger kids along with other scenes. 2) The rhino in the sky and the scene where James battles it wasn't explained enough. That's it for the criticism. The positive aspects of this movie were excellent. The live action sets and the stop-motion animation have an astounding charm to the book. The character designs are pretty unique and the Jack Skellington cameo as the captain of the skeletons was amazing. The acting is very superb. The stop-motion insects were good, the two mean aunts named Spike and Sponge were tolerable, and the main character James is very likable. Even the action is very good. Music/songs written by Randy Newman (The Toy Story trilogy, The Princess and the Frog) were surprising good. Although not a masterpiece, James and the Giant Peach is an enjoyable family entertainment that stays faithful to the story from a great author. 8/10

    In the beginning, Roald Dahl wrote a book called, "James and the Giant Peach". In 1996, "James and the Giant Peach", was turned into a live-action/stop-motion animated film. The movie was directed by Henry Selick and produced by Tim Burton (They both worked on The Nightmare Before Christmas). This is one of my favorite movies. The story was good, the character's were likable, and the animation was great. It combines computer-animation with stop-motion animation. But what also make's this movie really great is Randy Newmans song's in the movie. They were fun and memorable. Overall, "James and the Giant Peach", is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. 5/5

    There seems to be a split reaction from critics and audiences alike when talking about Henry Selick's 1996 stop-motion animated feature James and the Giant Peach. While the critics (particularly Gene Siskel) highly praise this picture and call it a wonderful children's fantasy, the audiences don't seem to care much for it maybe because it's too weird for them like many of the films made by Tim Burton, who is also one of the film's producers. Personally, I don't know what to make of this film even after seeing it plenty of times except that I can see where both sides are coming from. Before I delve into my own opinion regarding the pros and cons of this flick, let's look at the film's plot which was based on the children's story by Roald Dahl, who also wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. We follow a young British boy named James (Paul Terry) whose parents were killed by a rhinoceros (don't ask how or why since the picture never explains that). He is forced to live with his two despicable aunts (Miriam Margolyes, Joanna Lumley) where he has to do all kinds of chores (he practically does more work than those two ever seem to do in five seconds), and be humiliated in more ways than one. One day, a mysterious man (Pete Postlethwaite) who "knows more than just his name" gives James a bag of magical "crocodile tongues" which he claims will help put some happiness into his sad life. But when James accidentally lets these magical tongues loose, James and his aunts soon discover a peach on a dead tree that grows so gigantic that it's even bigger than the tree from which it grew on. The aunts plan on using their giant peach as a tourist attraction so they can make good profits off of their discovery, while James still has to continue doing chores. One night, James crawls inside a large hole in the peach and discovers a group of human-sized bugs including a grasshopper (Simon Callow), a centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), an earthworm (David Thewlis), a spider (Susan Sarandon), a ladybug (Jane Leeves), and a glowworm (Miriam Margolyes). Like James, they dream of getting out of his aunt's place in England and heading to New York City where his parents always dreamed of going. And that's exactly what they do through a series of elaborate, fanciful scenarios such as rolling away into the Atlantic Ocean, using Miss Spider's silk to capture and tie a hundred seagulls to the peach stem so the peach can fly, and battling a mechanical shark and skeleton pirates under the icy seas of the Arctic Ocean. Whether you like this children's fantasy or not, there are certain things about this picture that you got to give the film credit for. For one thing, regardless of how implausible the story can be most of the time, I do respect the creativity and the imagination that was incorporated into this story. I admire how this film had the courage to simply let its imagination run wild regardless of our skepticism and our knowledge that no such scenarios could take place in real life. The stop-motion animation is impressive in its own right particularly with the highly detailed and imaginative character designs. The voice-over work from the likes of Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, and Susan Sarandon are very well done and truly bring these characters to life. The songs by Randy Newman, with the exception of "My Name is James" which I thought had embarrassing lyrics, are pretty solid with the standouts being "Family" and "Good News". Like much of the best films made by the Disney Company, the strength of the film lies in the visuals and the audio. Now I will say that the storytelling in this film is not very consistent and is filled with major plot flaws that can't be glossed over. For example, I think that the film's writers made the aunt characters way too evil. If any parents of a child knew they had relatives who treated children the way these two aunts did, they should not have even allowed custody of the child to these people in the first place. Let me put this in another way, anyone who has relatives who taunt a child over the death of their parents or starve the child to death by feeding them non-food should not just simply pretend they don't exist, they need to have an intervention with them immediately for the benefit of the child. There are also some scenes that don't really go anywhere story wise. For example, the dream sequence with James as a caterpillar being chased by his aunts and the rhino that killed his parents is pretty pointless. To be fair though, there have been dream sequences in other films that are much worse than this, and they at least prepare us ahead of time for that type of scene. While the battles between the shark as well as the underwater skeleton pirates are decent, they both go by a little too quickly and neither leaves much of an impact. As long as you leave your common sense and logic out the door, James and the Giant Peach will fill the bill just fine as far as family entertainment goes. Kids and adults alike can admire the creativity of the story, the unique animation in the tradition of The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), the colorful characters including the centipede and the grasshopper, and maybe find one or two good tunes out of it as well. It's far from the Disney Company's greatest picture, but it's an interesting one at that.

    After The Nightmare Before Christmas, both Henry Selick and Tim Burton began work on another stop motion animated film, a film based on an acclaimed children's novel by British author Roald Dahl. James and The Giant Peach brings in a lot of the same elements as Nightmare, but also brings in many trademarks of it's own. This film brews live action scenes into the pot and is overall more brightly colored and sunny than Nightmare, whose scenes were mostly dark and night like. In my opinion, James and the Giant Peach is one of those films that constantly gets overlooked. While Nightmate gets a lot of recognition and fanatics, this film has a small cult following and when it comes to ranking the world's best stop motion classics, this one usually ranks low on the list or doesn't rank at all. It's a pity, because I think this is one of Selick and Burton's best accomplishments. As Roald Dahl hated the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory from 1971, I think he would have been quite proud of this picture, for it's one of those films that truly represents the mood, the look, and the imagination of the original novel. This film has some of Hollywood's finest either playing live action characters or stop motion characters. We have Miriam Margoyles and Joanna Lumley playing James' dreadful aunts, who are just as hilarious and silly looking as they are intimidating. Lumley's Aunt Spiker character can't go one scene without having her mouth hang wide open or giving off a evil smile, revealing her crooked, filthy teeth. Then there is Pete Postlewaite as the Magic Man who gives James a bag of crocodile tongues. He can have his creepy moments as well, but he overall plays the character as a mysterious figure. He's like the tinkerer from Willy Wonka. You just want to know more about him, but you can't because he's gone before you can wink. Playing James is Paul Terry, who's not known that much nowadays, but has appeared on CBBC's Microsoap series. He's a triumphant young man and his little singing number towards the beginning of the film really highlights his hopes and ambitions and desire to leave his nasty aunts. Playing the stop motion characters are a wide array of actors, actors like Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, even David Thewlis of Harry Potter fame. I think my favorite has got to be Dreyfuss' Centipede character, for he plays him as a slick, snarky, defiant Han Solo like character...with a cigar of course. My favorite scene out of the entire film is the scene depicting James and Centipede's adventure on a pirate ship under the sea. Many Nightmare Before Christmas fans know that this is the scene where the Jack Skellington puppet makes a cameo as the ship's deceased captain, and I think Selick and Burton did a fantastic job making him still retain his trademarks, but also look very different than the way him did in Nightmare. If I had to some up this film in one word, it's look. This film has a look unlike any other film. I said The Nightmare Before Christmas was like a mix between Rankin Bass' Rudolph and the works of Edward Gory, but I think this film combines the looks of Dr. Seuss with Nancy Ekholm Burkert, who illustrated Dahl's original book. Like in Nightmare, many things are rugged, crooked and crude, even the gleaming, sky scraping buildings of New York City. I also think the peach has quite an appeal to it. In several scenes, I just want to reach my hand into the screen and take a huge bite out of it. There is even a song about eating the peach present in the film, and Randy Newman must be praised for his excellent songwriting. James and the Giant Peach is a film that deserves a little more than what it gets. Sure, it's not my all time favorite, but I still hold it very close and love it, love it, love it, love it to pieces. If you want a film that combines stylized live action with fantastic stop motion sequences and odd, yet thrilling wizardry, this is your pot of tea.

    This movie is rotten like a spoiled peach. This pile of rotten apples was based on the book written by the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda, Roald Dahl. It is also directed by Henry Selick. So, why should I throw rotten peaches at the schmoes who made this crap? Read on and find out... The very first problem begins in the very first few minutes of the movie: the death of James' parents. According to the narrator, James' parents were eaten alive by a rhinoceros. Uh.... WHAT?!!! How do rhinos eat people?! Rhinoceri are herbivores not carnivores! I'm not kidding you, I didn't make this up! This is exactly what the narrator said about the death of James' parents. And afterwords, James becomes a ward for his two evil aunts. Call me crazy, but here's what really happened to James' parents: My guess is that James' evil aunts sneaked into the bedroom of James' parents and stabbed them to death out of extreme rage that James' parents are better than them. This is more realistic than "a rhino eating James' parents". Then, there's the songs. Listen how horrible the lyrics are! Randy Newman, you ought to be ashamed of yourself! You were one of my favorite composers! You composed the songs for the Toy Story movies, for god's sake! What was the matter with you?! This movie is so bad, the Nostalgia Critic was forced against his will making a "positive" review for this piece of crap. Pros: The artwork Cons: The songs, the CGI cloud effects, and the ridiculous explanation of how James' parents died.

    I remember when I was a kid and would slip in my Nightmare Before Christmas VHS tape, one of the trailers that was on it was James and the Giant Peach. I always wanted to see it, but my parents didn't buy the movie. I think because the film at the time had gotten Luke warm reviews, but over the years it seems like James and the Giant Peach got a cult following and an audience to boot. After all, we don't really get some of these great animated films that were from the 90's. Plus whenever there's a dark family film, a lot of parents tend to look down on it. I think today's parents have become a little too protective in my opinion. However, I had the opportunity to see the film yesterday and gladly watched it. I admit, my hopes were maybe a bit high, but I can see why the reviews were mixed on this one. James Henry Trotter is a young boy who lives with his parents by the sea. On James's birthday, they plan to go to New York City. However, his parents are later killed by a ghostly rhinoceros from the sky and finds himself living with his two cruel aunts, Spiker and Sponge. He is forced to work all day and they threaten him with beatings to keep him in line and taunt him about the mysterious rhino and other hazards if he tries to leave. While rescuing a spider from being squashed by his aunts, James meets a mysterious man with a bag of magic greens, which he gives to James to make his life better When James is returning to the house, he trips and the green beans escape into the ground. One peach is soon found on a withered old tree, and it grows. The aunts use the giant peach as an attraction, making lots of money as James watches from the house, not allowed to leave. That night, James is sent to pick up the garbage. While doing so, he grabs a chunk of the peach to eat. A large hole appears inside the peach and James ventures inside, were he finds and befriends a group of life-size anthropomorphic bugs who also dream of an ideal home and decide to travel to New York. I think if I saw this as a kid, I would've adored it. As an adult, I see that there scenes that lead to no where and there are some things that are not explained in the film that are explained in the book. I remember reading the book in elementary school and if you didn't read the book, I think you would be totally lost with the whole killer rhino ordeal. Also the aunts are so one note, first off, how is it this kid has the kindest parents in the world with the nastiest sisters who are extremely ugly and obviously hate kids? Yeah, I'm sure when the parents were writing their wills they said "Now, if something happens to us, who will take care of James""How about your parents who call and write letters daily and adore him?""No, I don't think they'll like him living with them""True, how about your 2 evil ugly sisters who hate him and love to beat him?""Perfect!". However, the animation is absolutely wonderful and really takes you back into Nightmare Before Christmas, in fact, there is even a cameo appearance by Jack Skeleton. The songs are charming and all of the characters are great too, even if not consistent. Like I don't get how the spider says she doesn't like socializing with anyone, but is clearly singing and dancing with them in the next scene without complaint. But for the kids, this is a great film that gives them hope to dream. I wish I would've seen it as a kid. But I still like it despite the flaws, considering that I think I'm just nitpicking at this point. I can understand why James and the Giant Peach found it's audience and where it will end up in the classics one day. 7/10

    I first saw this soon after it first came out, when I was about 11 or 12. I was really disappointed in it then - I couldn't get over all the changes from the book. Fifteen or so years later, I've rewatched it, having become familiar with Henry Selick's other work. And this time I really enjoyed it. The animation is high quality, despite being less ambitious than Selick's two other major films (the animated parts of James and the Giant Peach make up a film only about half the length of Coraline, and there aren't any of the huge crowds of characters that filled The Nightmare Before Christmas). The songs, however, are nowhere near as good as those of The Nightmare Before Christmas. The less said about James' solo song at the start of the film the better. The only really good song in the movie also happens to be the only one that takes its lyrics from a rhyme in Dahl's book. Now that this film has surprised me by being better than I remembered, despite its big changes from the book, perhaps I should give Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory another chance to do the same...

    A British orphan's, James Henry Trotter, dreams of emigrating to New York City are scuppered when his parents are killed surprisingly by a rhinoceros who appears 'from nowhere'. As a result, he is forced to live with his two spiteful aunts, Spiker & Sponge, who treat him like a labourer and feed him very bad food. One day, James receives a peach from a mysterious stranger. He explores the inside and enters in a strange world, which may lead to his dreams coming true again. James & The Giant Peach is based on Roald Dahl's weakest novel. Tim Burton and Henry Sellick's film adaption is a larger disappointment compared to the book. I, of course, mean no offence to them as their other films, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline prove a lot better than this garbage. Here are the reasons why James & The Giant Peach is toxic. What you, as a viewer, are analysing as you watch the film is a synopsis which is exactly the same as in the novel; completely random, lost and quite frankly, dumb. There is no reason why a rhino would eat a human being (or two as shown in the film), and in England as well. I'd probably understand if it was from a zoo, but that's where the characters belong. This brings me onto the next bad point; the acting. It is abysmal. There are too many repeated lines i.e. the aunts stating, 'Work, work, work' and lines such as 'How dare you disagree' said over and over again. Anybody who writes a screenplay needs to think carefully about the dialogue you use. Joanna Lumley was so much better as Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous and Victoria's mother in The Corpse Bride. But it's Paul Terry who makes a huge mess of the film. He overacts and quotes some of the worst lines in cinematic history. Even the songs cannot grow any excitement. Instead they include the most overrated melodies and over-repeated songs. That's The Life? It'll tire anybody sitting on a seat in a cinema and cause butt-ache. The songs are absolutely abysmal and the film is simply the worst to have been associated with Walt Disney Pictures (distributor), the second being the equally toxic Pocahontas, whose songs ain't as bad as on this. Good animation work though.

    Before we can go on a journey with the Giant Peach however, first Little James have to be orphaned. And he is, in a matter of fact voice-over that makes for a surprise element here. A bold way to get the plot in motion, and it works ! Many keep on wandering what or who that rhino was, that took the life of the parents just like that, on a whim. Well, anybody can be swept away by the rhino in the sky, or so the nasty aunties will have you believe anyway... The visuals are stunning, the dialogues are bubbling fizzing electrical fun and brought wonderfully and lovingly by a great cast, and direction is clear cut, sharp and focused. A lovely film, that makes you wonder what is Selnick & Burton and what's genuine Roald Dahl. A splendid film that makes you go out and want to read a great book (again). What more can we possibly ask of a peach? Hmmm, well ... about that Rhino in the stormy clouds ... Maybe ... If it's based in Britain, couldn't we tempt it to take a holiday somewhere in, say, Bora Bora or the Halls of Montezuma ? The English are quite accustomed to their climate, but their rhino gives us, here in the Lowlands, more than our share of rain and sleet too !!!

Like James, they dream of getting out of his aunt's place in England and heading to New York City where his parents always dreamed of going. And that's exactly what they do through a series of elaborate, fanciful scenarios such as rolling away into the Atlantic Ocean, using Miss Spider's silk to capture and tie a hundred seagulls to the peach stem so the peach can fly, and battling a mechanical shark and skeleton pirates under the icy seas of the Arctic Ocean.

As long as you leave your common sense and logic out the door, James and the Giant Peach will fill the bill just fine as far as family entertainment goes. Kids and adults alike can admire the creativity of the story, the unique animation in the tradition of The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), the colorful characters including the centipede and the grasshopper, and maybe find one or two good tunes out of it as well. It's far from the Disney Company's greatest picture, but it's an interesting one at that.

    After The Nightmare Before Christmas, both Henry Selick and Tim Burton began work on another stop motion animated film, a film based on an acclaimed children's novel by British author Roald Dahl. James and The Giant Peach brings in a lot of the same elements as Nightmare, but also brings in many trademarks of it's own. This film brews live action scenes into the pot and is overall more brightly colored and sunny than Nightmare, whose scenes were mostly dark and night like. In my opinion, James and the Giant Peach is one of those films that constantly gets overlooked. While Nightmate gets a lot of recognition and fanatics, this film has a small cult following and when it comes to ranking the world's best stop motion classics, this one usually ranks low on the list or doesn't rank at all. It's a pity, because I think this is one of Selick and Burton's best accomplishments. As Roald Dahl hated the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory from 1971, I think he would have been quite proud of this picture, for it's one of those films that truly represents the mood, the look, and the imagination of the original novel. This film has some of Hollywood's finest either playing live action characters or stop motion characters. We have Miriam Margoyles and Joanna Lumley playing James' dreadful aunts, who are just as hilarious and silly looking as they are intimidating. Lumley's Aunt Spiker character can't go one scene without having her mouth hang wide open or giving off a evil smile, revealing her crooked, filthy teeth. Then there is Pete Postlewaite as the Magic Man who gives James a bag of crocodile tongues. He can have his creepy moments as well, but he overall plays the character as a mysterious figure. He's like the tinkerer from Willy Wonka. You just want to know more about him, but you can't because he's gone before you can wink. Playing James is Paul Terry, who's not known that much nowadays, but has appeared on CBBC's Microsoap series. He's a triumphant young man and his little singing number towards the beginning of the film really highlights his hopes and ambitions and desire to leave his nasty aunts. Playing the stop motion characters are a wide array of actors, actors like Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, even David Thewlis of Harry Potter fame. I think my favorite has got to be Dreyfuss' Centipede character, for he plays him as a slick, snarky, defiant Han Solo like character...with a cigar of course. My favorite scene out of the entire film is the scene depicting James and Centipede's adventure on a pirate ship under the sea. Many Nightmare Before Christmas fans know that this is the scene where the Jack Skellington puppet makes a cameo as the ship's deceased captain, and I think Selick and Burton did a fantastic job making him still retain his trademarks, but also look very different than the way him did in Nightmare. If I had to some up this film in one word, it's look. This film has a look unlike any other film. I said The Nightmare Before Christmas was like a mix between Rankin Bass' Rudolph and the works of Edward Gory, but I think this film combines the looks of Dr. Seuss with Nancy Ekholm Burkert, who illustrated Dahl's original book. Like in Nightmare, many things are rugged, crooked and crude, even the gleaming, sky scraping buildings of New York City. I also think the peach has quite an appeal to it. In several scenes, I just want to reach my hand into the screen and take a huge bite out of it. There is even a song about eating the peach present in the film, and Randy Newman must be praised for his excellent songwriting. James and the Giant Peach is a film that deserves a little more than what it gets. Sure, it's not my all time favorite, but I still hold it very close and love it, love it, love it, love it to pieces. If you want a film that combines stylized live action with fantastic stop motion sequences and odd, yet thrilling wizardry, this is your pot of tea.

    This movie is rotten like a spoiled peach. This pile of rotten apples was based on the book written by the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda, Roald Dahl. It is also directed by Henry Selick. So, why should I throw rotten peaches at the schmoes who made this crap? Read on and find out... The very first problem begins in the very first few minutes of the movie: the death of James' parents. According to the narrator, James' parents were eaten alive by a rhinoceros. Uh.... WHAT?!!! How do rhinos eat people?! Rhinoceri are herbivores not carnivores! I'm not kidding you, I didn't make this up! This is exactly what the narrator said about the death of James' parents. And afterwords, James becomes a ward for his two evil aunts. Call me crazy, but here's what really happened to James' parents: My guess is that James' evil aunts sneaked into the bedroom of James' parents and stabbed them to death out of extreme rage that James' parents are better than them. This is more realistic than "a rhino eating James' parents". Then, there's the songs. Listen how horrible the lyrics are! Randy Newman, you ought to be ashamed of yourself! You were one of my favorite composers! You composed the songs for the Toy Story movies, for god's sake! What was the matter with you?! This movie is so bad, the Nostalgia Critic was forced against his will making a "positive" review for this piece of crap. Pros: The artwork Cons: The songs, the CGI cloud effects, and the ridiculous explanation of how James' parents died.

    I remember when I was a kid and would slip in my Nightmare Before Christmas VHS tape, one of the trailers that was on it was James and the Giant Peach. I always wanted to see it, but my parents didn't buy the movie. I think because the film at the time had gotten Luke warm reviews, but over the years it seems like James and the Giant Peach got a cult following and an audience to boot. After all, we don't really get some of these great animated films that were from the 90's. Plus whenever there's a dark family film, a lot of parents tend to look down on it. I think today's parents have become a little too protective in my opinion. However, I had the opportunity to see the film yesterday and gladly watched it. I admit, my hopes were maybe a bit high, but I can see why the reviews were mixed on this one. James Henry Trotter is a young boy who lives with his parents by the sea. On James's birthday, they plan to go to New York City. However, his parents are later killed by a ghostly rhinoceros from the sky and finds himself living with his two cruel aunts, Spiker and Sponge. He is forced to work all day and they threaten him with beatings to keep him in line and taunt him about the mysterious rhino and other hazards if he tries to leave. While rescuing a spider from being squashed by his aunts, James meets a mysterious man with a bag of magic greens, which he gives to James to make his life better When James is returning to the house, he trips and the green beans escape into the ground. One peach is soon found on a withered old tree, and it grows. The aunts use the giant peach as an attraction, making lots of money as James watches from the house, not allowed to leave. That night, James is sent to pick up the garbage. While doing so, he grabs a chunk of the peach to eat. A large hole appears inside the peach and James ventures inside, were he finds and befriends a group of life-size anthropomorphic bugs who also dream of an ideal home and decide to travel to New York. I think if I saw this as a kid, I would've adored it. As an adult, I see that there scenes that lead to no where and there are some things that are not explained in the film that are explained in the book. I remember reading the book in elementary school and if you didn't read the book, I think you would be totally lost with the whole killer rhino ordeal. Also the aunts are so one note, first off, how is it this kid has the kindest parents in the world with the nastiest sisters who are extremely ugly and obviously hate kids? Yeah, I'm sure when the parents were writing their wills they said "Now, if something happens to us, who will take care of James""How about your parents who call and write letters daily and adore him?""No, I don't think they'll like him living with them""True, how about your 2 evil ugly sisters who hate him and love to beat him?""Perfect!". However, the animation is absolutely wonderful and really takes you back into Nightmare Before Christmas, in fact, there is even a cameo appearance by Jack Skeleton. The songs are charming and all of the characters are great too, even if not consistent. Like I don't get how the spider says she doesn't like socializing with anyone, but is clearly singing and dancing with them in the next scene without complaint. But for the kids, this is a great film that gives them hope to dream. I wish I would've seen it as a kid. But I still like it despite the flaws, considering that I think I'm just nitpicking at this point. I can understand why James and the Giant Peach found it's audience and where it will end up in the classics one day. 7/10

    I first saw this soon after it first came out, when I was about 11 or 12. I was really disappointed in it then - I couldn't get over all the changes from the book. Fifteen or so years later, I've rewatched it, having become familiar with Henry Selick's other work. And this time I really enjoyed it. The animation is high quality, despite being less ambitious than Selick's two other major films (the animated parts of James and the Giant Peach make up a film only about half the length of Coraline, and there aren't any of the huge crowds of characters that filled The Nightmare Before Christmas). The songs, however, are nowhere near as good as those of The Nightmare Before Christmas. The less said about James' solo song at the start of the film the better. The only really good song in the movie also happens to be the only one that takes its lyrics from a rhyme in Dahl's book. Now that this film has surprised me by being better than I remembered, despite its big changes from the book, perhaps I should give Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory another chance to do the same...

    A British orphan's, James Henry Trotter, dreams of emigrating to New York City are scuppered when his parents are killed surprisingly by a rhinoceros who appears 'from nowhere'. As a result, he is forced to live with his two spiteful aunts, Spiker & Sponge, who treat him like a labourer and feed him very bad food. One day, James receives a peach from a mysterious stranger. He explores the inside and enters in a strange world, which may lead to his dreams coming true again. James & The Giant Peach is based on Roald Dahl's weakest novel. Tim Burton and Henry Sellick's film adaption is a larger disappointment compared to the book. I, of course, mean no offence to them as their other films, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline prove a lot better than this garbage. Here are the reasons why James & The Giant Peach is toxic. What you, as a viewer, are analysing as you watch the film is a synopsis which is exactly the same as in the novel; completely random, lost and quite frankly, dumb. There is no reason why a rhino would eat a human being (or two as shown in the film), and in England as well. I'd probably understand if it was from a zoo, but that's where the characters belong. This brings me onto the next bad point; the acting. It is abysmal. There are too many repeated lines i.e. the aunts stating, 'Work, work, work' and lines such as 'How dare you disagree' said over and over again. Anybody who writes a screenplay needs to think carefully about the dialogue you use. Joanna Lumley was so much better as Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous and Victoria's mother in The Corpse Bride. But it's Paul Terry who makes a huge mess of the film. He overacts and quotes some of the worst lines in cinematic history. Even the songs cannot grow any excitement. Instead they include the most overrated melodies and over-repeated songs. That's The Life? It'll tire anybody sitting on a seat in a cinema and cause butt-ache. The songs are absolutely abysmal and the film is simply the worst to have been associated with Walt Disney Pictures (distributor), the second being the equally toxic Pocahontas, whose songs ain't as bad as on this. Good animation work though.

    Before we can go on a journey with the Giant Peach however, first Little James have to be orphaned. And he is, in a matter of fact voice-over that makes for a surprise element here. A bold way to get the plot in motion, and it works ! Many keep on wandering what or who that rhino was, that took the life of the parents just like that, on a whim. Well, anybody can be swept away by the rhino in the sky, or so the nasty aunties will have you believe anyway... The visuals are stunning, the dialogues are bubbling fizzing electrical fun and brought wonderfully and lovingly by a great cast, and direction is clear cut, sharp and focused. A lovely film, that makes you wonder what is Selnick & Burton and what's genuine Roald Dahl. A splendid film that makes you go out and want to read a great book (again). What more can we possibly ask of a peach? Hmmm, well ... about that Rhino in the stormy clouds ... Maybe ... If it's based in Britain, couldn't we tempt it to take a holiday somewhere in, say, Bora Bora or the Halls of Montezuma ? The English are quite accustomed to their climate, but their rhino gives us, here in the Lowlands, more than our share of rain and sleet too !!!

    I wanted to watch this movie for a while. There are not many around animated this way and I did love The Nightmare before Christmas and Coraline. So, I finally gave it a try. I was not particularly impressed. I found the story somehow bland and uninspiring. Also, any little moral message in it is basically lost in a number of events that I presume are supposed to be exciting but are rather dull. The songs are not really bad, although they don't save the film. Perhaps I'm just too old for this, although I still love other family films like the ones mentioned at the beginning. I find this film just OK, I wouldn't watch it again.

    James and the Giant Peach is a stop motion/live action adaptation of the late Roald Dahl's book in the early 60s when being transitioned into film (like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The BFG, The Witches, Matilda, and The Fantastic Mr. Fox) about a young boy named James, who climbs into the peach and meets anthropomorphic stop-motion insects and stumbles upon an adventure of a lifetime. Many critics and fans of Roald Dahl alike were amazed about how faithful this movie was to the book, but there are two problems that I do have with this adaptation. 1) The beginning was quite dark and might frighten younger kids along with other scenes. 2) The rhino in the sky and the scene where James battles it wasn't explained enough. That's it for the criticism. The positive aspects of this movie were excellent. The live action sets and the stop-motion animation have an astounding charm to the book. The character designs are pretty unique and the Jack Skellington cameo as the captain of the skeletons was amazing. The acting is very superb. The stop-motion insects were good, the two mean aunts named Spike and Sponge were tolerable, and the main character James is very likable. Even the action is very good. Music/songs written by Randy Newman (The Toy Story trilogy, The Princess and the Frog) were surprising good. Although not a masterpiece, James and the Giant Peach is an enjoyable family entertainment that stays faithful to the story from a great author. 8/10

    In the beginning, Roald Dahl wrote a book called, "James and the Giant Peach". In 1996, "James and the Giant Peach", was turned into a live-action/stop-motion animated film. The movie was directed by Henry Selick and produced by Tim Burton (They both worked on The Nightmare Before Christmas). This is one of my favorite movies. The story was good, the character's were likable, and the animation was great. It combines computer-animation with stop-motion animation. But what also make's this movie really great is Randy Newmans song's in the movie. They were fun and memorable. Overall, "James and the Giant Peach", is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. 5/5

    There seems to be a split reaction from critics and audiences alike when talking about Henry Selick's 1996 stop-motion animated feature James and the Giant Peach. While the critics (particularly Gene Siskel) highly praise this picture and call it a wonderful children's fantasy, the audiences don't seem to care much for it maybe because it's too weird for them like many of the films made by Tim Burton, who is also one of the film's producers. Personally, I don't know what to make of this film even after seeing it plenty of times except that I can see where both sides are coming from. Before I delve into my own opinion regarding the pros and cons of this flick, let's look at the film's plot which was based on the children's story by Roald Dahl, who also wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. We follow a young British boy named James (Paul Terry) whose parents were killed by a rhinoceros (don't ask how or why since the picture never explains that). He is forced to live with his two despicable aunts (Miriam Margolyes, Joanna Lumley) where he has to do all kinds of chores (he practically does more work than those two ever seem to do in five seconds), and be humiliated in more ways than one. One day, a mysterious man (Pete Postlethwaite) who "knows more than just his name" gives James a bag of magical "crocodile tongues" which he claims will help put some happiness into his sad life. But when James accidentally lets these magical tongues loose, James and his aunts soon discover a peach on a dead tree that grows so gigantic that it's even bigger than the tree from which it grew on. The aunts plan on using their giant peach as a tourist attraction so they can make good profits off of their discovery, while James still has to continue doing chores. One night, James crawls inside a large hole in the peach and discovers a group of human-sized bugs including a grasshopper (Simon Callow), a centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), an earthworm (David Thewlis), a spider (Susan Sarandon), a ladybug (Jane Leeves), and a glowworm (Miriam Margolyes). Like James, they dream of getting out of his aunt's place in England and heading to New York City where his parents always dreamed of going. And that's exactly what they do through a series of elaborate, fanciful scenarios such as rolling away into the Atlantic Ocean, using Miss Spider's silk to capture and tie a hundred seagulls to the peach stem so the peach can fly, and battling a mechanical shark and skeleton pirates under the icy seas of the Arctic Ocean. Whether you like this children's fantasy or not, there are certain things about this picture that you got to give the film credit for. For one thing, regardless of how implausible the story can be most of the time, I do respect the creativity and the imagination that was incorporated into this story. I admire how this film had the courage to simply let its imagination run wild regardless of our skepticism and our knowledge that no such scenarios could take place in real life. The stop-motion animation is impressive in its own right particularly with the highly detailed and imaginative character designs. The voice-over work from the likes of Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, and Susan Sarandon are very well done and truly bring these characters to life. The songs by Randy Newman, with the exception of "My Name is James" which I thought had embarrassing lyrics, are pretty solid with the standouts being "Family" and "Good News". Like much of the best films made by the Disney Company, the strength of the film lies in the visuals and the audio. Now I will say that the storytelling in this film is not very consistent and is filled with major plot flaws that can't be glossed over. For example, I think that the film's writers made the aunt characters way too evil. If any parents of a child knew they had relatives who treated children the way these two aunts did, they should not have even allowed custody of the child to these people in the first place. Let me put this in another way, anyone who has relatives who taunt a child over the death of their parents or starve the child to death by feeding them non-food should not just simply pretend they don't exist, they need to have an intervention with them immediately for the benefit of the child. There are also some scenes that don't really go anywhere story wise. For example, the dream sequence with James as a caterpillar being chased by his aunts and the rhino that killed his parents is pretty pointless. To be fair though, there have been dream sequences in other films that are much worse than this, and they at least prepare us ahead of time for that type of scene. While the battles between the shark as well as the underwater skeleton pirates are decent, they both go by a little too quickly and neither leaves much of an impact. As long as you leave your common sense and logic out the door, James and the Giant Peach will fill the bill just fine as far as family entertainment goes. Kids and adults alike can admire the creativity of the story, the unique animation in the tradition of The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), the colorful characters including the centipede and the grasshopper, and maybe find one or two good tunes out of it as well. It's far from the Disney Company's greatest picture, but it's an interesting one at that.

On James's birthday, they plan to go to New York City. However, his parents are later killed by a ghostly rhinoceros from the sky and finds himself living with his two cruel aunts, Spiker and Sponge. He is forced to work all day and they threaten him with beatings to keep him in line and taunt him about the mysterious rhino and other hazards if he tries to leave. While rescuing a spider from being squashed by his aunts, James meets a mysterious man with a bag of magic greens, which he gives to James to make his life better When James is returning to the house, he trips and the green beans escape into the ground. One peach is soon found on a withered old tree, and it grows. The aunts use the giant peach as an attraction, making lots of money as James watches from the house, not allowed to leave. That night, James is sent to pick up the garbage. While doing so, he grabs a chunk of the peach to eat. A large hole appears inside the peach and James ventures inside, were he finds and befriends a group of life-size anthropomorphic bugs who also dream of an ideal home and decide to travel to New York. I think if I saw this as a kid, I would've adored it. As an adult, I see that there scenes that lead to no where and there are some things that are not explained in the film that are explained in the book. I remember reading the book in elementary school and if you didn't read the book, I think you would be totally lost with the whole killer rhino ordeal. Also the aunts are so one note, first off, how is it this kid has the kindest parents in the world with the nastiest sisters who are extremely ugly and obviously hate kids? Yeah, I'm sure when the parents were writing their wills they said "Now, if something happens to us, who will take care of James""How about your parents who call and write letters daily and adore him?""No, I don't think they'll like him living with them""True, how about your 2 evil ugly sisters who hate him and love to beat him?""Perfect!". However, the animation is absolutely wonderful and really takes you back into Nightmare Before Christmas, in fact, there is even a cameo appearance by Jack Skeleton. The songs are charming and all of the characters are great too, even if not consistent. Like I don't get how the spider says she doesn't like socializing with anyone, but is clearly singing and dancing with them in the next scene without complaint. But for the kids, this is a great film that gives them hope to dream. I wish I would've seen it as a kid. But I still like it despite the flaws, considering that I think I'm just nitpicking at this point. I can understand why James and the Giant Peach found it's audience and where it will end up in the classics one day. 7/10

    I first saw this soon after it first came out, when I was about 11 or 12. I was really disappointed in it then - I couldn't get over all the changes from the book. Fifteen or so years later, I've rewatched it, having become familiar with Henry Selick's other work. And this time I really enjoyed it. The animation is high quality, despite being less ambitious than Selick's two other major films (the animated parts of James and the Giant Peach make up a film only about half the length of Coraline, and there aren't any of the huge crowds of characters that filled The Nightmare Before Christmas). The songs, however, are nowhere near as good as those of The Nightmare Before Christmas. The less said about James' solo song at the start of the film the better. The only really good song in the movie also happens to be the only one that takes its lyrics from a rhyme in Dahl's book. Now that this film has surprised me by being better than I remembered, despite its big changes from the book, perhaps I should give Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory another chance to do the same...

    A British orphan's, James Henry Trotter, dreams of emigrating to New York City are scuppered when his parents are killed surprisingly by a rhinoceros who appears 'from nowhere'. As a result, he is forced to live with his two spiteful aunts, Spiker & Sponge, who treat him like a labourer and feed him very bad food. One day, James receives a peach from a mysterious stranger. He explores the inside and enters in a strange world, which may lead to his dreams coming true again. James & The Giant Peach is based on Roald Dahl's weakest novel. Tim Burton and Henry Sellick's film adaption is a larger disappointment compared to the book. I, of course, mean no offence to them as their other films, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline prove a lot better than this garbage. Here are the reasons why James & The Giant Peach is toxic. What you, as a viewer, are analysing as you watch the film is a synopsis which is exactly the same as in the novel; completely random, lost and quite frankly, dumb. There is no reason why a rhino would eat a human being (or two as shown in the film), and in England as well. I'd probably understand if it was from a zoo, but that's where the characters belong. This brings me onto the next bad point; the acting. It is abysmal. There are too many repeated lines i.e. the aunts stating, 'Work, work, work' and lines such as 'How dare you disagree' said over and over again. Anybody who writes a screenplay needs to think carefully about the dialogue you use. Joanna Lumley was so much better as Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous and Victoria's mother in The Corpse Bride. But it's Paul Terry who makes a huge mess of the film. He overacts and quotes some of the worst lines in cinematic history. Even the songs cannot grow any excitement. Instead they include the most overrated melodies and over-repeated songs. That's The Life? It'll tire anybody sitting on a seat in a cinema and cause butt-ache. The songs are absolutely abysmal and the film is simply the worst to have been associated with Walt Disney Pictures (distributor), the second being the equally toxic Pocahontas, whose songs ain't as bad as on this. Good animation work though.

    Before we can go on a journey with the Giant Peach however, first Little James have to be orphaned. And he is, in a matter of fact voice-over that makes for a surprise element here. A bold way to get the plot in motion, and it works ! Many keep on wandering what or who that rhino was, that took the life of the parents just like that, on a whim. Well, anybody can be swept away by the rhino in the sky, or so the nasty aunties will have you believe anyway... The visuals are stunning, the dialogues are bubbling fizzing electrical fun and brought wonderfully and lovingly by a great cast, and direction is clear cut, sharp and focused. A lovely film, that makes you wonder what is Selnick & Burton and what's genuine Roald Dahl. A splendid film that makes you go out and want to read a great book (again). What more can we possibly ask of a peach? Hmmm, well ... about that Rhino in the stormy clouds ... Maybe ... If it's based in Britain, couldn't we tempt it to take a holiday somewhere in, say, Bora Bora or the Halls of Montezuma ? The English are quite accustomed to their climate, but their rhino gives us, here in the Lowlands, more than our share of rain and sleet too !!!

    I wanted to watch this movie for a while. There are not many around animated this way and I did love The Nightmare before Christmas and Coraline. So, I finally gave it a try. I was not particularly impressed. I found the story somehow bland and uninspiring. Also, any little moral message in it is basically lost in a number of events that I presume are supposed to be exciting but are rather dull. The songs are not really bad, although they don't save the film. Perhaps I'm just too old for this, although I still love other family films like the ones mentioned at the beginning. I find this film just OK, I wouldn't watch it again.

    James and the Giant Peach is a stop motion/live action adaptation of the late Roald Dahl's book in the early 60s when being transitioned into film (like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The BFG, The Witches, Matilda, and The Fantastic Mr. Fox) about a young boy named James, who climbs into the peach and meets anthropomorphic stop-motion insects and stumbles upon an adventure of a lifetime. Many critics and fans of Roald Dahl alike were amazed about how faithful this movie was to the book, but there are two problems that I do have with this adaptation. 1) The beginning was quite dark and might frighten younger kids along with other scenes. 2) The rhino in the sky and the scene where James battles it wasn't explained enough. That's it for the criticism. The positive aspects of this movie were excellent. The live action sets and the stop-motion animation have an astounding charm to the book. The character designs are pretty unique and the Jack Skellington cameo as the captain of the skeletons was amazing. The acting is very superb. The stop-motion insects were good, the two mean aunts named Spike and Sponge were tolerable, and the main character James is very likable. Even the action is very good. Music/songs written by Randy Newman (The Toy Story trilogy, The Princess and the Frog) were surprising good. Although not a masterpiece, James and the Giant Peach is an enjoyable family entertainment that stays faithful to the story from a great author. 8/10

    In the beginning, Roald Dahl wrote a book called, "James and the Giant Peach". In 1996, "James and the Giant Peach", was turned into a live-action/stop-motion animated film. The movie was directed by Henry Selick and produced by Tim Burton (They both worked on The Nightmare Before Christmas). This is one of my favorite movies. The story was good, the character's were likable, and the animation was great. It combines computer-animation with stop-motion animation. But what also make's this movie really great is Randy Newmans song's in the movie. They were fun and memorable. Overall, "James and the Giant Peach", is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. 5/5
