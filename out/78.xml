 <sinopse>
  When a boy learns that a beloved killer whale is to be killed by the aquarium owners, the boy risks everything to free the whale.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Fishermen separate a young orca whale (Willy) from his parents and he ends up in a fish bowl at a marina. Meanwhile, a street kid runs afoul of the law and gets caught vandalising the marina, but his social worker gets him off the hook (so to speak) provided he cleans up his mess at the marina. While there, he befriends the whale and teaches him tricks, something the trainer hasn't been able to do. But when Willy is a dud in front of the audience, the marina owner plans some bad things, and the boy and his friends must try to (*** MAJOR SPOILERS ***) free Willy.

    Although we could not deny that there are many other films that feature aquatic animals, what makes Free Willy different from other related films are its twists, distorted character profiles, and exciting plot. Why would the director or the writer even think of having Jesse's mind baffled instead of just making it smoother by having Jesse focused on what he is doing? But those flabbergasting twists are what makes Free Willy a good movie. It never ran out of good ideas to convolute the screen portrayal so that the audience may be stimulated. In fact, boredom seldom touched me, being an audience and a critic. There were just some scenes that irritates me because I believe that the producers could have intensified these sequences even more by adding some action scenes so that they may be able to add a greater tension on the viewers and that the audience may really feel and take in what is happening on screen. The animatronic stand-in that was used in most close-up scenes of Willy also was quite good. There was never a time when the CGIs (Computer Generated Effects) failed. They really looked like real and natural. And the stunts made, although was created with the extensive use of CGI, was perfect and was pleasing to the eyes. The screen portrayal of the actors and actresses also were quite good and was enough to please the audience. The musical scoring of the movie was satisfactory, nevertheless. It was good especially during the crises of the movie, but I was expecting for more since musical scoring are a great factor to catch the audience. I guess there's not much to say about this movie because I believe that its succeeding sequels are enough to prove how successful the movie is and that couldn't have been achieved if the quality was poor. All in all, congratulations to the movie and the people behind its production. 8 out of 10 for you guys!

    OK, so "Free Willy" makes a point about animal rights, but it really could've dealt with the topic more seriously. I later saw Keiko while he was in the Oregon aquarium (and he showed the audience a little more than they bargained for, let's just say). They later moved him to Iceland, where he died in 2003. Personally, I don't think that they had to compose a new song for the movie, since the previous 25 years had produced a number of environmental songs (one of the best was Joan Baez's theme song for "Silent Running", a movie that now seems so realistic as to be redundant). But anyway, the movie is worth seeing. Oh, and props to Groucho Marx for the pun that I used in the review title.

    This movie practically -is- my childhood. I watched it every single day, wore out two VHS tapes, and now have the DVD. I think the acting is great, especially Jason James Richter's performance as Jesse. He did a fantastic job at displaying all of the emotions Jesse felt throughout the movie, especially in the ending. I always cry at the end of this movie and I honestly believe that if it weren't for Richter's acting, I might not be as effected by this movie. He does a magnificent job at portraying the character development and changes in Jesse. The storyline itself is pretty believable, until the jump at the ending, but its obvious that it isn't meant to be realistic, but inspiring. The bond between Jesse and Willy feels very powerful in this movie, more so than in the second and third, in my opinion. When watching, I can't help but feel like there's a genuine connection between Richter and Keiko. Overall, a very heartwarming, inspiring story about what friendship can accomplish, and that its always best to do what's right, even if its painful (Jesse didn't want to say goodbye for Willy, but "had to look out for him and do what's best for him"). One of the best movies about the bond between a child and an animal.

    I loved this movie as a kid, watched it over and over and it always made me cry at the end again. Now, several years later, I bought it again on DVD just yesterday. I watched it back, and even though it's clearly a children's movie, I was filled with nostalgia and I fell in love with this movie again, even through an adults view. The concept of a friendship with an animal that wild, powerful, big, gracious and un-pet-like, used to stimulate my imagination as a kid, and the movie still knew how to charm me. To see how the connection between Willy and Jesse develops is a moving thing to see. So it's not true that only kids can enjoy it, I still loved it even now. You should judge it in the perspective of the target age group it's meant for, it's a great children's movie. One of the greatest, if you ask me. They don't make 'em like these anymore. Main actor Jason James Richter is great as Jesse, he has a lot of charisma, and his acting is very natural. I also have always liked the character Randolph, the wise Indian guy. He just makes the Free-Willy-picture complete somehow. Moving story, and fantastically performed. Show your kids this one, and not the remake. It's a pleasure to all the family.

    This is a perfect example of a family film that knows exactly what it's doing. While a little too clich&eacute;d and some of the villainy is a tad overdone, Free Willy is still very entertaining and touching. The cinematography is lovely and the scenery is beautiful, but the combining of animatronic shots and of Keiko the killer whale is astoundingly good. Simon Wincer directs efficiently, the family-bonding scenes are nice and sweet, the soundtrack is delightful and the script has its touches of honesty and humour. The acting is good too, it is wonderful to see Michael Madson again and he is excellent, and Jason James Richter is believable as Jesse. However, it is killer whale Keiko as Willy who makes the movie, for a killer whale, Willy is very cute and endearing, and the scenes with Richter are irresistible. Overall, just an entertaining family film. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Flipper. The Black Stallion. Gentle Ben. the list goes on. What is this list? a list of films where boys and animals become best friends, but yet it seems someone's trying to tear them apart. there is such a case with Free Willy, a film that opened the eyes of millions of people, calling the number at the end of the film, donating 20 million smackeroos so whales could remain free. Jesse is a boy with a dream. his dream? that one day his mother will return for him ever since being abandoned as a child. he hates his foster parents, he hates his life. but one day he stumbles into the display of the great killer whale, Willy (played by Keiko) and then becomes inseparable to him. along with Rae, a marine biologist with the same love of whales (And a love for sports bras in public.) and the wise native, Randolph. Let me tell you a story. my parents hated this film. why? cause of the native guy's prayer - Salanaa eiyung ayesis. No clue what it means, but it freaked my hardcore Christian parents in '93. so it's been about 15 years since i've seen this film. and about 15 years since i heard Michael Jackson sing the theme to it. that always stood out. the Free Willy theme, "will you be there?" Bottom line, a pretty good family flick. i suggest you buy it. there's usually 10 or so VHS copies in Thrift stores.

    I'm not entirely sure why this movie has the low rating that it does because I really feel that "Free Willy" is a pretty entertaining kids movie. I first watched this film in the theater when I was ten years old. I really enjoyed it at the time. However I could not remember it all too well so I decided to watch it again sixteen years later and I still thought it was a pretty good kids movie. When you watch this you must keep in mind that it is intended to be for kids, not adults. It's not something like "The Brave Little Toaster", which is a kids movie but can also be thoroughly enjoyed by adults. "Free Willy" is just a bit too silly to be taken seriously by adults. I mean, stealing a whale and driving all over town with him in the back of your truck? I think that just about sums up how ridiculous this movie gets. But kids do think about things like that. It's a good plot for a child. I think the 5.2 rating on IMDb is not a just one, but at the same time this film is not one of the best kids movies I have seen. I would recommend showing it to your child though.

    I'm so sick of the reviews that go around about this being the greatest family film ever made, blah blah blah, it goes on and on. Like the fact that it's a family film is a sign of greatness or something. The Michael Jackson soundtrack is a joke, the whale who plays Willy unimpressive and the main star is horrible. Michael Madsen and Lori Petty are embarrassing in their supporting roles. One of the worst of the 90's. And because of IMDb's ten lines roles, I have to fill this space with useless crap about the movie and how bad it is. It's bad. I'd give it less than a star if I could. And they're making a Free Willy 4 next year. That's how bad it is. Somebody needs to free me from seeing these piece of crap films.

    Ahh, screw it. This movie is a total guilty pleasure but at the same time is a very complete dramatic feature. I won't get into specific details but I can tell you that the movie is not only about a social message; it deals with an intense problematic about animal rights plus the relationship (magical) between a young boy and a whale. I was really convinced that this movie was only to cash some money but the truth is that is a very powerful film experience. I watched it on theaters and it made me feel really good, powerful at some aspects. Plus the movie's main song courtesy of Michael Jackson is really haunting. A movie not to be missed and a classic of 90's Cinema.

    This renowned PG-rated family flick was released when I was around seven years old. I didn't see it in the theatre, but I don't think it was too long afterwards when I saw some of it in the VHS format. I don't recall ever seeing the whole thing during my childhood, though I did see the first of the two sequels, "Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home", from start to finish one time. When I rented the original "Free Willy" just yesterday, I could only remember a little bit of it from what I saw back in the 90's. After all these years, I've finally seen the entire film. However, as much as a fair number of other people seem to like it, I definitely didn't find it as entertaining and touching as many have made it out to be, which didn't surprise me after seeing its mediocre rating here first. Jesse is a troubled 12 year old boy who was abandoned by his mother years ago. One night, while getting into mischief with a group of friends, he is caught by the police after vandalizing an aquatic park. His social worker, Dwight Mercer, manages to get him off the hook, provided he cleans up the mess he has made at the park. As Jesse works at the park, he looks in the tank and sees an orca whale named Willy, who was sadly separated from his family in the ocean recently and brought here. The 12 year old boy befriends this whale, and manages to teach him tricks, which nobody else has succeeded in doing. However, it turns out that Willy won't do these tricks in front of a big audience, with kids banging on the tank windows. Dial, the park owner, has an evil plan, and the homesick orca whale's life is in danger! The beginning of the film, showing whales in the ocean, may not be that bad at first, but it's a little too long. After the capture, we are introduced to Jesse, played by Jason James Richter, and it doesn't exactly improve here, which leads me to another slight problem I have with this movie. This problem is the characters. This includes the main kid. At the beginning, he's one rotten little brat, but I guess that can easily happen with the kind of childhood he's had. Yes, much of the film is supposed to be extremely touching, and clearly is to some people, but to me, it just seemed a little too phony. The story may have some occasional mildly touching moments, but they are very brief. There may be a bit of excitement as well, but in the end, despite the fact that I wasn't completely bored throughout, I was still left with indifference. Nothing too overwhelming. I know this is a film about saving whales, and I assure you, I do not approve of the captivity of marine animals. They're meant to live in the ocean, not chlorinated tanks. Still, this movie just didn't quite do it for me. I also know I'm writing this just a couple days after the death of Michael Jackson, who sang the closing theme, "Will You Be There", for this movie, but that is of mere coincidence. I didn't know he sang the theme song, nor did I even know what this movie's theme song was, before I rented it yesterday! If I had seen the entire film from start to finish during my childhood, it just might have been a more entertaining and memorable experience than it was for me watching it after growing up. "Free Willy" should be a nice, moving family drama, but somehow, it fails. Many kids might like it, and adults as well, but in my opinion, it's far from the perfect, heartwarming family film it seems to have often been considered.

    This renowned PG-rated family flick was released when I was around seven years old. I didn't see it in the theatre, but I don't think it was too long afterwards when I saw some of it in the VHS format. I don't recall ever seeing the whole thing during my childhood, though I did see the first of the two sequels, "Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home", from start to finish one time. When I rented the original "Free Willy" just yesterday, I could only remember a little bit of it from what I saw back in the 90's. After all these years, I've finally seen the entire film. However, as much as a fair number of other people seem to like it, I definitely didn't find it as entertaining and touching as many have made it out to be, which didn't surprise me after seeing its mediocre rating here first. Jesse is a troubled 12 year old boy who was abandoned by his mother years ago. One night, while getting into mischief with a group of friends, he is caught by the police after vandalizing an aquatic park. His social worker, Dwight Mercer, manages to get him off the hook, provided he cleans up the mess he has made at the park. As Jesse works at the park, he looks in the tank and sees an orca whale named Willy, who was sadly separated from his family in the ocean recently and brought here. The 12 year old boy befriends this whale, and manages to teach him tricks, which nobody else has succeeded in doing. However, it turns out that Willy won't do these tricks in front of a big audience, with kids banging on the tank windows. Dial, the park owner, has an evil plan, and the homesick orca whale's life is in danger! The beginning of the film, showing whales in the ocean, may not be that bad at first, but it's a little too long. After the capture, we are introduced to Jesse, played by Jason James Richter, and it doesn't exactly improve here, which leads me to another slight problem I have with this movie. This problem is the characters. This includes the main kid. At the beginning, he's one rotten little brat, but I guess that can easily happen with the kind of childhood he's had. Yes, much of the film is supposed to be extremely touching, and clearly is to some people, but to me, it just seemed a little too phony. The story may have some occasional mildly touching moments, but they are very brief. There may be a bit of excitement as well, but in the end, despite the fact that I wasn't completely bored throughout, I was still left with indifference. Nothing too overwhelming. I know this is a film about saving whales, and I assure you, I do not approve of the captivity of marine animals. They're meant to live in the ocean, not chlorinated tanks. Still, this movie just didn't quite do it for me. I also know I'm writing this just a couple days after the death of Michael Jackson, who sang the closing theme, "Will You Be There", for this movie, but that is of mere coincidence. I didn't know he sang the theme song, nor did I even know what this movie's theme song was, before I rented it yesterday! If I had seen the entire film from start to finish during my childhood, it just might have been a more entertaining and memorable experience than it was for me watching it after growing up. "Free Willy" should be a nice, moving family drama, but somehow, it fails. Many kids might like it, and adults as well, but in my opinion, it's far from the perfect, heartwarming family film it seems to have often been considered.

    Although we could not deny that there are many other films that feature aquatic animals, what makes Free Willy different from other related films are its twists, distorted character profiles, and exciting plot. Why would the director or the writer even think of having Jesse's mind baffled instead of just making it smoother by having Jesse focused on what he is doing? But those flabbergasting twists are what makes Free Willy a good movie. It never ran out of good ideas to convolute the screen portrayal so that the audience may be stimulated. In fact, boredom seldom touched me, being an audience and a critic. There were just some scenes that irritates me because I believe that the producers could have intensified these sequences even more by adding some action scenes so that they may be able to add a greater tension on the viewers and that the audience may really feel and take in what is happening on screen. The animatronic stand-in that was used in most close-up scenes of Willy also was quite good. There was never a time when the CGIs (Computer Generated Effects) failed. They really looked like real and natural. And the stunts made, although was created with the extensive use of CGI, was perfect and was pleasing to the eyes. The screen portrayal of the actors and actresses also were quite good and was enough to please the audience. The musical scoring of the movie was satisfactory, nevertheless. It was good especially during the crises of the movie, but I was expecting for more since musical scoring are a great factor to catch the audience. I guess there's not much to say about this movie because I believe that its succeeding sequels are enough to prove how successful the movie is and that couldn't have been achieved if the quality was poor. All in all, congratulations to the movie and the people behind its production. 8 out of 10 for you guys!

    OK, so "Free Willy" makes a point about animal rights, but it really could've dealt with the topic more seriously. I later saw Keiko while he was in the Oregon aquarium (and he showed the audience a little more than they bargained for, let's just say). They later moved him to Iceland, where he died in 2003. Personally, I don't think that they had to compose a new song for the movie, since the previous 25 years had produced a number of environmental songs (one of the best was Joan Baez's theme song for "Silent Running", a movie that now seems so realistic as to be redundant). But anyway, the movie is worth seeing. Oh, and props to Groucho Marx for the pun that I used in the review title.

    This movie practically -is- my childhood. I watched it every single day, wore out two VHS tapes, and now have the DVD. I think the acting is great, especially Jason James Richter's performance as Jesse. He did a fantastic job at displaying all of the emotions Jesse felt throughout the movie, especially in the ending. I always cry at the end of this movie and I honestly believe that if it weren't for Richter's acting, I might not be as effected by this movie. He does a magnificent job at portraying the character development and changes in Jesse. The storyline itself is pretty believable, until the jump at the ending, but its obvious that it isn't meant to be realistic, but inspiring. The bond between Jesse and Willy feels very powerful in this movie, more so than in the second and third, in my opinion. When watching, I can't help but feel like there's a genuine connection between Richter and Keiko. Overall, a very heartwarming, inspiring story about what friendship can accomplish, and that its always best to do what's right, even if its painful (Jesse didn't want to say goodbye for Willy, but "had to look out for him and do what's best for him"). One of the best movies about the bond between a child and an animal.

    I loved this movie as a kid, watched it over and over and it always made me cry at the end again. Now, several years later, I bought it again on DVD just yesterday. I watched it back, and even though it's clearly a children's movie, I was filled with nostalgia and I fell in love with this movie again, even through an adults view. The concept of a friendship with an animal that wild, powerful, big, gracious and un-pet-like, used to stimulate my imagination as a kid, and the movie still knew how to charm me. To see how the connection between Willy and Jesse develops is a moving thing to see. So it's not true that only kids can enjoy it, I still loved it even now. You should judge it in the perspective of the target age group it's meant for, it's a great children's movie. One of the greatest, if you ask me. They don't make 'em like these anymore. Main actor Jason James Richter is great as Jesse, he has a lot of charisma, and his acting is very natural. I also have always liked the character Randolph, the wise Indian guy. He just makes the Free-Willy-picture complete somehow. Moving story, and fantastically performed. Show your kids this one, and not the remake. It's a pleasure to all the family.

    This is a perfect example of a family film that knows exactly what it's doing. While a little too clich&eacute;d and some of the villainy is a tad overdone, Free Willy is still very entertaining and touching. The cinematography is lovely and the scenery is beautiful, but the combining of animatronic shots and of Keiko the killer whale is astoundingly good. Simon Wincer directs efficiently, the family-bonding scenes are nice and sweet, the soundtrack is delightful and the script has its touches of honesty and humour. The acting is good too, it is wonderful to see Michael Madson again and he is excellent, and Jason James Richter is believable as Jesse. However, it is killer whale Keiko as Willy who makes the movie, for a killer whale, Willy is very cute and endearing, and the scenes with Richter are irresistible. Overall, just an entertaining family film. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Flipper. The Black Stallion. Gentle Ben. the list goes on. What is this list? a list of films where boys and animals become best friends, but yet it seems someone's trying to tear them apart. there is such a case with Free Willy, a film that opened the eyes of millions of people, calling the number at the end of the film, donating 20 million smackeroos so whales could remain free. Jesse is a boy with a dream. his dream? that one day his mother will return for him ever since being abandoned as a child. he hates his foster parents, he hates his life. but one day he stumbles into the display of the great killer whale, Willy (played by Keiko) and then becomes inseparable to him. along with Rae, a marine biologist with the same love of whales (And a love for sports bras in public.) and the wise native, Randolph. Let me tell you a story. my parents hated this film. why? cause of the native guy's prayer - Salanaa eiyung ayesis. No clue what it means, but it freaked my hardcore Christian parents in '93. so it's been about 15 years since i've seen this film. and about 15 years since i heard Michael Jackson sing the theme to it. that always stood out. the Free Willy theme, "will you be there?" Bottom line, a pretty good family flick. i suggest you buy it. there's usually 10 or so VHS copies in Thrift stores.

    I'm not entirely sure why this movie has the low rating that it does because I really feel that "Free Willy" is a pretty entertaining kids movie. I first watched this film in the theater when I was ten years old. I really enjoyed it at the time. However I could not remember it all too well so I decided to watch it again sixteen years later and I still thought it was a pretty good kids movie. When you watch this you must keep in mind that it is intended to be for kids, not adults. It's not something like "The Brave Little Toaster", which is a kids movie but can also be thoroughly enjoyed by adults. "Free Willy" is just a bit too silly to be taken seriously by adults. I mean, stealing a whale and driving all over town with him in the back of your truck? I think that just about sums up how ridiculous this movie gets. But kids do think about things like that. It's a good plot for a child. I think the 5.2 rating on IMDb is not a just one, but at the same time this film is not one of the best kids movies I have seen. I would recommend showing it to your child though.

    I'm so sick of the reviews that go around about this being the greatest family film ever made, blah blah blah, it goes on and on. Like the fact that it's a family film is a sign of greatness or something. The Michael Jackson soundtrack is a joke, the whale who plays Willy unimpressive and the main star is horrible. Michael Madsen and Lori Petty are embarrassing in their supporting roles. One of the worst of the 90's. And because of IMDb's ten lines roles, I have to fill this space with useless crap about the movie and how bad it is. It's bad. I'd give it less than a star if I could. And they're making a Free Willy 4 next year. That's how bad it is. Somebody needs to free me from seeing these piece of crap films.

    Ahh, screw it. This movie is a total guilty pleasure but at the same time is a very complete dramatic feature. I won't get into specific details but I can tell you that the movie is not only about a social message; it deals with an intense problematic about animal rights plus the relationship (magical) between a young boy and a whale. I was really convinced that this movie was only to cash some money but the truth is that is a very powerful film experience. I watched it on theaters and it made me feel really good, powerful at some aspects. Plus the movie's main song courtesy of Michael Jackson is really haunting. A movie not to be missed and a classic of 90's Cinema.

And because of IMDb's ten lines roles, I have to fill this space with useless crap about the movie and how bad it is. It's bad. I'd give it less than a star if I could. And they're making a Free Willy 4 next year. That's how bad it is. Somebody needs to free me from seeing these piece of crap films.

    Ahh, screw it. This movie is a total guilty pleasure but at the same time is a very complete dramatic feature. I won't get into specific details but I can tell you that the movie is not only about a social message; it deals with an intense problematic about animal rights plus the relationship (magical) between a young boy and a whale. I was really convinced that this movie was only to cash some money but the truth is that is a very powerful film experience. I watched it on theaters and it made me feel really good, powerful at some aspects. Plus the movie's main song courtesy of Michael Jackson is really haunting. A movie not to be missed and a classic of 90's Cinema.

    This renowned PG-rated family flick was released when I was around seven years old. I didn't see it in the theatre, but I don't think it was too long afterwards when I saw some of it in the VHS format. I don't recall ever seeing the whole thing during my childhood, though I did see the first of the two sequels, "Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home", from start to finish one time. When I rented the original "Free Willy" just yesterday, I could only remember a little bit of it from what I saw back in the 90's. After all these years, I've finally seen the entire film. However, as much as a fair number of other people seem to like it, I definitely didn't find it as entertaining and touching as many have made it out to be, which didn't surprise me after seeing its mediocre rating here first. Jesse is a troubled 12 year old boy who was abandoned by his mother years ago. One night, while getting into mischief with a group of friends, he is caught by the police after vandalizing an aquatic park. His social worker, Dwight Mercer, manages to get him off the hook, provided he cleans up the mess he has made at the park. As Jesse works at the park, he looks in the tank and sees an orca whale named Willy, who was sadly separated from his family in the ocean recently and brought here. The 12 year old boy befriends this whale, and manages to teach him tricks, which nobody else has succeeded in doing. However, it turns out that Willy won't do these tricks in front of a big audience, with kids banging on the tank windows. Dial, the park owner, has an evil plan, and the homesick orca whale's life is in danger! The beginning of the film, showing whales in the ocean, may not be that bad at first, but it's a little too long. After the capture, we are introduced to Jesse, played by Jason James Richter, and it doesn't exactly improve here, which leads me to another slight problem I have with this movie. This problem is the characters. This includes the main kid. At the beginning, he's one rotten little brat, but I guess that can easily happen with the kind of childhood he's had. Yes, much of the film is supposed to be extremely touching, and clearly is to some people, but to me, it just seemed a little too phony. The story may have some occasional mildly touching moments, but they are very brief. There may be a bit of excitement as well, but in the end, despite the fact that I wasn't completely bored throughout, I was still left with indifference. Nothing too overwhelming. I know this is a film about saving whales, and I assure you, I do not approve of the captivity of marine animals. They're meant to live in the ocean, not chlorinated tanks. Still, this movie just didn't quite do it for me. I also know I'm writing this just a couple days after the death of Michael Jackson, who sang the closing theme, "Will You Be There", for this movie, but that is of mere coincidence. I didn't know he sang the theme song, nor did I even know what this movie's theme song was, before I rented it yesterday! If I had seen the entire film from start to finish during my childhood, it just might have been a more entertaining and memorable experience than it was for me watching it after growing up. "Free Willy" should be a nice, moving family drama, but somehow, it fails. Many kids might like it, and adults as well, but in my opinion, it's far from the perfect, heartwarming family film it seems to have often been considered.

    Although we could not deny that there are many other films that feature aquatic animals, what makes Free Willy different from other related films are its twists, distorted character profiles, and exciting plot. Why would the director or the writer even think of having Jesse's mind baffled instead of just making it smoother by having Jesse focused on what he is doing? But those flabbergasting twists are what makes Free Willy a good movie. It never ran out of good ideas to convolute the screen portrayal so that the audience may be stimulated. In fact, boredom seldom touched me, being an audience and a critic. There were just some scenes that irritates me because I believe that the producers could have intensified these sequences even more by adding some action scenes so that they may be able to add a greater tension on the viewers and that the audience may really feel and take in what is happening on screen. The animatronic stand-in that was used in most close-up scenes of Willy also was quite good. There was never a time when the CGIs (Computer Generated Effects) failed. They really looked like real and natural. And the stunts made, although was created with the extensive use of CGI, was perfect and was pleasing to the eyes. The screen portrayal of the actors and actresses also were quite good and was enough to please the audience. The musical scoring of the movie was satisfactory, nevertheless. It was good especially during the crises of the movie, but I was expecting for more since musical scoring are a great factor to catch the audience. I guess there's not much to say about this movie because I believe that its succeeding sequels are enough to prove how successful the movie is and that couldn't have been achieved if the quality was poor. All in all, congratulations to the movie and the people behind its production. 8 out of 10 for you guys!

    OK, so "Free Willy" makes a point about animal rights, but it really could've dealt with the topic more seriously. I later saw Keiko while he was in the Oregon aquarium (and he showed the audience a little more than they bargained for, let's just say). They later moved him to Iceland, where he died in 2003. Personally, I don't think that they had to compose a new song for the movie, since the previous 25 years had produced a number of environmental songs (one of the best was Joan Baez's theme song for "Silent Running", a movie that now seems so realistic as to be redundant). But anyway, the movie is worth seeing. Oh, and props to Groucho Marx for the pun that I used in the review title.

    This movie practically -is- my childhood. I watched it every single day, wore out two VHS tapes, and now have the DVD. I think the acting is great, especially Jason James Richter's performance as Jesse. He did a fantastic job at displaying all of the emotions Jesse felt throughout the movie, especially in the ending. I always cry at the end of this movie and I honestly believe that if it weren't for Richter's acting, I might not be as effected by this movie. He does a magnificent job at portraying the character development and changes in Jesse. The storyline itself is pretty believable, until the jump at the ending, but its obvious that it isn't meant to be realistic, but inspiring. The bond between Jesse and Willy feels very powerful in this movie, more so than in the second and third, in my opinion. When watching, I can't help but feel like there's a genuine connection between Richter and Keiko. Overall, a very heartwarming, inspiring story about what friendship can accomplish, and that its always best to do what's right, even if its painful (Jesse didn't want to say goodbye for Willy, but "had to look out for him and do what's best for him"). One of the best movies about the bond between a child and an animal.

    I loved this movie as a kid, watched it over and over and it always made me cry at the end again. Now, several years later, I bought it again on DVD just yesterday. I watched it back, and even though it's clearly a children's movie, I was filled with nostalgia and I fell in love with this movie again, even through an adults view. The concept of a friendship with an animal that wild, powerful, big, gracious and un-pet-like, used to stimulate my imagination as a kid, and the movie still knew how to charm me. To see how the connection between Willy and Jesse develops is a moving thing to see. So it's not true that only kids can enjoy it, I still loved it even now. You should judge it in the perspective of the target age group it's meant for, it's a great children's movie. One of the greatest, if you ask me. They don't make 'em like these anymore. Main actor Jason James Richter is great as Jesse, he has a lot of charisma, and his acting is very natural. I also have always liked the character Randolph, the wise Indian guy. He just makes the Free-Willy-picture complete somehow. Moving story, and fantastically performed. Show your kids this one, and not the remake. It's a pleasure to all the family.

    This is a perfect example of a family film that knows exactly what it's doing. While a little too clich&eacute;d and some of the villainy is a tad overdone, Free Willy is still very entertaining and touching. The cinematography is lovely and the scenery is beautiful, but the combining of animatronic shots and of Keiko the killer whale is astoundingly good. Simon Wincer directs efficiently, the family-bonding scenes are nice and sweet, the soundtrack is delightful and the script has its touches of honesty and humour. The acting is good too, it is wonderful to see Michael Madson again and he is excellent, and Jason James Richter is believable as Jesse. However, it is killer whale Keiko as Willy who makes the movie, for a killer whale, Willy is very cute and endearing, and the scenes with Richter are irresistible. Overall, just an entertaining family film. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Flipper. The Black Stallion. Gentle Ben. the list goes on. What is this list? a list of films where boys and animals become best friends, but yet it seems someone's trying to tear them apart. there is such a case with Free Willy, a film that opened the eyes of millions of people, calling the number at the end of the film, donating 20 million smackeroos so whales could remain free. Jesse is a boy with a dream. his dream? that one day his mother will return for him ever since being abandoned as a child. he hates his foster parents, he hates his life. but one day he stumbles into the display of the great killer whale, Willy (played by Keiko) and then becomes inseparable to him. along with Rae, a marine biologist with the same love of whales (And a love for sports bras in public.) and the wise native, Randolph. Let me tell you a story. my parents hated this film. why? cause of the native guy's prayer - Salanaa eiyung ayesis. No clue what it means, but it freaked my hardcore Christian parents in '93. so it's been about 15 years since i've seen this film. and about 15 years since i heard Michael Jackson sing the theme to it. that always stood out. the Free Willy theme, "will you be there?" Bottom line, a pretty good family flick. i suggest you buy it. there's usually 10 or so VHS copies in Thrift stores.

    I'm not entirely sure why this movie has the low rating that it does because I really feel that "Free Willy" is a pretty entertaining kids movie. I first watched this film in the theater when I was ten years old. I really enjoyed it at the time. However I could not remember it all too well so I decided to watch it again sixteen years later and I still thought it was a pretty good kids movie. When you watch this you must keep in mind that it is intended to be for kids, not adults. It's not something like "The Brave Little Toaster", which is a kids movie but can also be thoroughly enjoyed by adults. "Free Willy" is just a bit too silly to be taken seriously by adults. I mean, stealing a whale and driving all over town with him in the back of your truck? I think that just about sums up how ridiculous this movie gets. But kids do think about things like that. It's a good plot for a child. I think the 5.2 rating on IMDb is not a just one, but at the same time this film is not one of the best kids movies I have seen. I would recommend showing it to your child though.
