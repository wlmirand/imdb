    Peter Sellers returns as Inspector Clouseau after an 11 year absence, in this amusing sequel which finds the Pink Panther diamond being stolen again, and Clouseau is convinced that suspected jewel thief the Phantom is behind it, which means Sir Charles Litton(Christopher Plummer taking over from David Niven) is the prime suspect, along with his beautiful wife(played by Catherine Schell, though oddly, despite the end of the original film, doesn't seem to be Clouseau's ex-wife?) Herbert Lom again plays Dreyfeuss, and is portrayed as being on the verge of insanity. Burt Kwouk plays Cato, still trying to combat his employer Clouseau! Funny film has lots of inspired scenes, as Clouseau's disguises start to become elaborate. Leads directly into "...Strikes Again!"

    The third installment in the series begins when Inspector Clouseau is put on the case when the Pink Panther diamond is stolen, with the Phantom's trademark glove the only clue. Eleven years after the comedic masterpiece A Shot In The Dark, Peter Sellers returns as the bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau in another hysterical series of misadventures, that is known as, The Return Of The Pink Panther. In this movie, The Pink Panther returns...and so do the laughs! The third installment of the comedy series is a hysterical laugh fest, and that's not joke, the movie has got a lot of laughs, and when I mean laughs, I mean big laughs! The scenes in which Clouseau and Cato get into their brawls are hysterical enough, the scenes where Dreyfus keeps shooting himself are laugh filled too, and not to mention the scene where Clouseau is vacuuming the room and disaster ensues! In short, disaster ensues all over the place, it is the quintessential Pink Panther comedy film starring Peter Sellers! All in all, this is another big one for Peter Sellers, and Blake Edwards too! As he was in the two previous films, Peter Sellers is hilarious as the clumsy and bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau, who is trying to find The Pink Panther, and runs into mishaps at just about every turn! Christopher Plummer replaces David Niven as Sir Charles Litton, The Phantom. While Plummer was great, he in my opinion was a little too young for the role. Don't get me wrong, Plummer was great, but Niven was better. And of course, the late Herbert Lom delivers a wonderful performance as Clouseau's superior, Charles Dreyfus. By this time, Dreyfus is trying to get rid of Clouseau. And when I saw that, I don't mean firing him, I mean he wants to KILL him! In short, everybody in this movie is wonderful, with Sellers and Lom standing out the most. And as usual, the writing and directing from Blake Edwards is superb too. Blake Edwards was a comedic genius, and so was Peter Sellers, and when they worked together on this movie, they created another comedic masterpiece! All in all, The Return Of The Pink Panther is another great installment in the franchise, and it is another comedy gem brought to you by Blake Edwards (may he rest in peace). The series was great up until after Revenge Of The Pink Panther. After that, the series was finished, because Peter Sellers had died from a sudden heart attack. There is just no replacing Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau, there is only one Inspector Clouseau, and that is Peter Sellers. Even Blake Edwards said that it was a mistake to go on without Sellers. But anyway, this movie is hysterical, if you loved The Pink Panther and A Shot In The Dark, then what are you waiting for, you've got to see this hysterical third installment, as it will have you laughing yourself silly! You'll split your sides as you watch Inspector Clouseau get himself into a whole lot of trouble and mishaps, and you'll laugh even more when you see him trying to get out of them! 10/10

    Here is more like it, a true comedy with a screenplay that doesn't look ludicrous like that of A Shot In The Dark, and a plot that is so solid that makes you linger till the end to see what the outcome will be. Written, directed and produced by Blake Edwards this 1975 film in The Pink Panther series is breath taking funny and stands as one I will always remember. Inspector Clouseau fake exaggerated French accent is more pronounced in this movie, The Return of the Pink Panther than the previous and Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus mishaps were funnier than expected, that i found myself looking forward to his next unfortunate mishap. The chief instrument of his (other than the existence of Clouseasu) was his inability to tell which he was holding a gun or a lighter. The film stars Peter Sellers who reprises his role as Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The Return of the Pink Panther also stars the 84th Academy Award (2012) winner for best supporting actor (who became the oldest actor to win the award at age 82) Christopher Plummer who replaced David Niven as Sir Charles Lytton (the notorious Phantom). In this flick the Pink Panther diamond is now back in focus as it gets stolen again, and the man who was part responsible for finding it when it got stolen the first time, was called back to help recover the stolen diamond. The movie plot is funny to the core, with screenplays that will make you hold your ribs from bursting free. The late Blake Edwards (died in 2010) is known primarily for his comedies and this movie shows us why. The plot began in the fictional country of Lugash, a mysterious thief breaks into the National Museum, avoiding all the security pitfalls that were set in place for any prospective thief and steals the Pink Panther diamond. The mysterious thief left behind a calling card, which was a white monogrammed glove with a gold-tinted "P" on it. Feeling outwitted by the thief who was able to get pass the elaborated security system, put in place to secure the diamond, the Shah of Lugash requests the assistance of Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) to help them as they try to recover their national treasure. Clouseau on the other hand had been demoted to a beat cop, to patrol the streets. This was done by his boss, Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who despises Clouseau with a passion and dreams daily of killing him. This movie I do recommend to comedy lovers and I will proudly say this movie is better than the remake done by Steve Martin and Jean Reno in both 2006 and 2008. www.lagsreviews.com

    Return of the Pink Panther (1975) Complete with the great Mancini sax theme, the nutty smart Blake Edwards directing, the sassy cartoon panther himself, and of course Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau (taking on many absurd disguises). This is the third of the original Pink Panther movies series (omitting the oddball fourth one from 1968 that didn't have Mancini, Sellers, or Edwards), and it comes over a decade after the first two. Was the public interested? Yes--it did well. It was a great formula. Is it still a good formula in 2012? Good question. It depends on your taste. But surely the names repeated above are all cinema greats that, like Chaplin, rise above their time. But of course, Sellers, as terrific as he was, was no Charles Chaplin. At his best, the comedy is hilarious. And that makes the movie worth watching for sure. But he is sometimes a bit off in his timing, or is stuck playing a stunt that isn't worthy of him. There's also a lag in the filler material, the scenes between the great stuff. Some marginal characters (including the leading woman, who is totally a late 60s type, not a 1975 type, and she feels oddly unnecessary) don't command their parts, or their scenes. The drift begins to drift. And then you realize there isn't much of a plot. The whole recovery (sort of) of the famous Pink Panther diamond after an elaborate theft isn't really the driving force of the movie. What takes its place is a slow interplay of the characters all stumbling over each other trying to trick the perpetrator into revealing the gem. So then you are back to the stumbling as comedy, and sometimes it's great. There are so many ridiculous moments with Sellers being a bumbling fool like no one, you are sure to laugh. And that's what you're here for. "The Pink Panther" is the original, and at times also a bit sluggish, but it's the first. And "A Shot in the Dark" is the best of the three, I think. But if you like them, you'll be just fine here. If you haven't seen any, you might go in order, since the sets and music are really spot on in the first two, and a bit more transporting. There is something a little off kilter here that make it an awkward, but decent, third.

    Ironically, the best part of the movie isn't any of the comic scenes, but the part at the beginning depicting the elaborate way the thief gets past all the traps to steal the Pink Panther jewel. While the comic scenes with Clouseau are funny, they don't all necessarily add to the storyline. In "A Shot In The Dark", Clouseau's repeated gaffes serve to ultimately drive Commissioner Dreyfus crazy; in this movie, most of them seem to just serve as filler entertainment, such as the part where he is disguised as a hotel room cleaner and has everything go wrong when he tries to do that job. The movie's other major problem is that Christopher Plummer was a poor substitute for David Niven as the Phantom. Niven was suave and cool; Plummer was a thuggish brute who resorted to breaking bones-rather unlike how a suave cat burglar is supposed to behave. This could have been a much better movie than it was.

    As a preamble I must confess that Sellers' mere appearance on screen as the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau reduces me to tears of laughter. My dear late wife would admonish me when often I alone in the theater would burst into laughter when Clouseau would merely saunter onto the screen in his smug superior fashion as in the beginning of this movie in the organ grinder scene. Sellers, in the sequels to the Shot in the Dark movie really camped up Clouseau, especially the fractured "French" accent which even the other characters cannot fathom. Make no mistake, this movie is all about Sellers and Clouseau doing physical, farcical, and dialog comedy. Also hilarious is Herbert Lom's portrayal of Dreyfous, Clouseau's boss, who is eventually driven literally mad by Clouseau as the Panther movies progress. This movie is superior to the later sequels and even if you are not a Sellers fan worth seeing. For those of you who are fans of Sellers, this is a must see movie revolving around one of the most funny, iconic, comedic characters ever portrayed on film.

    I enjoy a vast majority of the Pink Panther movies with Peter Sellars, with A Shot in the Dark being my personal favourite. The Return of the Pink Panther is for me the second best of the series, and one of the funnier entries. The production values are wonderful with striking cinematography and elegant locations and costumes. And who can forget Henry Mancini's iconic music and the opening sequence? The story is interesting, it isn't as slow as The Pink Panther or as ridiculous as Revenge of the Pink Panther which I did appreciate. The cast and comedy were what elevated this film though. The dialogue is very inspired especially Clousseau's wooing of Catherine Schell's Claudine with his chat up lines that are oddly reminiscent of the style of Humphrey Bogart. The slapstick is bumbling and always delivered, with the best scenes being Lytton's escape from the thugs, Clousseau's distraction during the bank robbery, Clousseau posing as a telephone repair man and especially the scene with the runaway vacuum cleaner. The characters are wonderfully crazy, and the acting is very good, as good as Catherine Schell, Herbert Lom(with his mental breakdown another highlight) and Christopher Plummer are, it is Peter Sellars who steals the show, his Clousseau as always is a riot. Overall, a great comedy and film. If there was anything that wasn't as good with the film, it was perhaps the length, the film could've done with being 5-10 minutes shorter. But it is a genuinely funny and well performed film and for me one of the better entries of the series. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    Picking up the role of Inspector Clouseau over a decade after A Shot in the Dark, Peter Sellers in this movie makes you wish he hadn't done something else for all that time. Though terribly plotted, The Return of the Pink Panther is filled with enough genuine hilarity that you won't really mind. The story is almost too simple. The legendary Pink Panther diamond is stolen from its home in the Middle Eastern country of Lugash, with evidence left behind implicating the almost-as-legendary jewel thief "The Phantom". The man who retrieved the diamond the first time it was stolen by The Phantom, Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers), is called into action, much to the chagrin of his dementedly frustrated boss, Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom). But it turns out that Sir Charles Litton (Christopher Plummer), the man who was The Phantom before retiring to please his young wife Claudine (Catherine Schell), is not responsible for the theft. Litton decides to head to Lugash to get to the bottom of the mystery while Clouseau is left to follow the Lady Litton to Switzerland as part of his own investigation. These Pink Panther movies are easy to review. Peter Sellers gives one of the greatest slapstick performances in cinema history as Clouseau, but there's not much else here. This one is essentially split in two, with Christopher Plummer doing a fairly good impersonation of Roger Moore, if James Bond were an international jewel thief, and Sellers just left to his own devices as Catherine Schell does little more than laugh at Clouseau's antics. Things are spiced up a bit with Herbert Lom's twitchy portrayal of Dreyfus' decent into madness over the colossal incompetence of his subordinate. I haven't the slightest idea why Blake Edwards thought anyone cared about Sir Charles Litton as much as Clouseau and while Edwards has his virtues as a storyteller, a sharp sense of pacing isn't one of them. This movie has a bloated and slack feel to it. Sellers is also noticeably less spry in the mid 70s than he was in the mid 60s. None of it matters all that much, because The Return of the Pink Panther has more than enough laughs, particularly Clouseau's battles with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk) and an epic struggle of Man vs. Lamp. This is a funny, family-friendly movie you should definitely watch with your kids when they're little.

    Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards reunite in this riotous comedy that is by far one of the better Pink Panther films. Sellers is on top form as Clouseau and nails every joke that Edwards sets up for them. A lot has been said about the relationship between the great actor and director but this film is a testament to how good they were together when on form. As always Herbert Lom is fantastic as Dreyfus and Burt Kwonk makes the martial art scenes a scream. Overall a fantastic entry to one of the best film comedy series of all time.

    Where Blake Edwards was once a handler of comedies combining slapstick, sophisticated wit, melancholia and social criticism, which was nearly forgotten by the time he's sold out this far into the eponymous franchise, because this one is just slapstick. Nothing else. He's mostly celebrated as the creator of the Pink Panther series. But this one's problem is how it drags. There isn't any anticipation felt or even created, any comic anguish, that nearly Hitchcockian suspense where time suddenly dilates to allow a burst of laughter. Other than the usual homage to the silent cinema of Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Leo McCarey, the Clouseau films seem to reveal preoccupations that come up again and again in Edwards' work. Clouseau is very much a hysterical white male and much of the series' humor comes from the ludicrous gap between his presumptions of cultural superiority and his idiotic behavior. He feels free to treat his Asian manservant Cato brutally, and proclaims his mastery over women, yet he is spectacularly inept at everything he attempts and is constantly humiliated. Clouseau's humiliations are particularly evident in a subtext of the films involving his predominant sexual embarrassment and failure. An elaborately original cartoon throughout the opening credits gets this amusingly distracting movie off to a lighthearted start before the bungling Inspector is asked by an Arab government to help them trace the Pink Panther diamond, which has been stolen from their theoretically impenetrable national museum. Clouseau deems the burglary to be the graft of Sir Charles Litton, a.k.a. The Phantom. To facilitate his own protection, the cunning Litton embarks on his own to recover the offender while his wife Claudine deflects Clouseau. The action is not so much a slapstick aficionado's ice cream castle as a slapstick aficionado's house of Cheetos. Our inelegant star is disengaged by defective vehicles, a telephone, a doorbell, revolving doors, a vacuum cleaner, a lamp, a parrot, and the exceedingly fanatical Cado who is provided with secret hiding places and surprise Kung Fu assaults. The sight gags come on like lightning and frantically, but the story line flies in several directions at once, where the original Pink Panther and A Shot in the Dark were methodically clever caper plots constructed out of their slapstick scenarios. Return of the Pink Panther is constructed right in synch with the brain's most rudimentary wavelengths, which is perhaps why it's a good house of Cheetos, a vegging-out flick.

    The third installment in the series begins when Inspector Clouseau is put on the case when the Pink Panther diamond is stolen, with the Phantom's trademark glove the only clue. Eleven years after the comedic masterpiece A Shot In The Dark, Peter Sellers returns as the bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau in another hysterical series of misadventures, that is known as, The Return Of The Pink Panther. In this movie, The Pink Panther returns...and so do the laughs! The third installment of the comedy series is a hysterical laugh fest, and that's not joke, the movie has got a lot of laughs, and when I mean laughs, I mean big laughs! The scenes in which Clouseau and Cato get into their brawls are hysterical enough, the scenes where Dreyfus keeps shooting himself are laugh filled too, and not to mention the scene where Clouseau is vacuuming the room and disaster ensues! In short, disaster ensues all over the place, it is the quintessential Pink Panther comedy film starring Peter Sellers! All in all, this is another big one for Peter Sellers, and Blake Edwards too! As he was in the two previous films, Peter Sellers is hilarious as the clumsy and bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau, who is trying to find The Pink Panther, and runs into mishaps at just about every turn! Christopher Plummer replaces David Niven as Sir Charles Litton, The Phantom. While Plummer was great, he in my opinion was a little too young for the role. Don't get me wrong, Plummer was great, but Niven was better. And of course, the late Herbert Lom delivers a wonderful performance as Clouseau's superior, Charles Dreyfus. By this time, Dreyfus is trying to get rid of Clouseau. And when I saw that, I don't mean firing him, I mean he wants to KILL him! In short, everybody in this movie is wonderful, with Sellers and Lom standing out the most. And as usual, the writing and directing from Blake Edwards is superb too.

The series was great up until after Revenge Of The Pink Panther. After that, the series was finished, because Peter Sellers had died from a sudden heart attack. There is just no replacing Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau, there is only one Inspector Clouseau, and that is Peter Sellers. Even Blake Edwards said that it was a mistake to go on without Sellers. But anyway, this movie is hysterical, if you loved The Pink Panther and A Shot In The Dark, then what are you waiting for, you've got to see this hysterical third installment, as it will have you laughing yourself silly! You'll split your sides as you watch Inspector Clouseau get himself into a whole lot of trouble and mishaps, and you'll laugh even more when you see him trying to get out of them! 10/10

While the comic scenes with Clouseau are funny, they don't all necessarily add to the storyline. In "A Shot In The Dark", Clouseau's repeated gaffes serve to ultimately drive Commissioner Dreyfus crazy; in this movie, most of them seem to just serve as filler entertainment, such as the part where he is disguised as a hotel room cleaner and has everything go wrong when he tries to do that job. The movie's other major problem is that Christopher Plummer was a poor substitute for David Niven as the Phantom. Niven was suave and cool; Plummer was a thuggish brute who resorted to breaking bones-rather unlike how a suave cat burglar is supposed to behave. This could have been a much better movie than it was.

    As a preamble I must confess that Sellers' mere appearance on screen as the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau reduces me to tears of laughter. My dear late wife would admonish me when often I alone in the theater would burst into laughter when Clouseau would merely saunter onto the screen in his smug superior fashion as in the beginning of this movie in the organ grinder scene. Sellers, in the sequels to the Shot in the Dark movie really camped up Clouseau, especially the fractured "French" accent which even the other characters cannot fathom. Make no mistake, this movie is all about Sellers and Clouseau doing physical, farcical, and dialog comedy. Also hilarious is Herbert Lom's portrayal of Dreyfous, Clouseau's boss, who is eventually driven literally mad by Clouseau as the Panther movies progress. This movie is superior to the later sequels and even if you are not a Sellers fan worth seeing. For those of you who are fans of Sellers, this is a must see movie revolving around one of the most funny, iconic, comedic characters ever portrayed on film.

    I enjoy a vast majority of the Pink Panther movies with Peter Sellars, with A Shot in the Dark being my personal favourite. The Return of the Pink Panther is for me the second best of the series, and one of the funnier entries. The production values are wonderful with striking cinematography and elegant locations and costumes. And who can forget Henry Mancini's iconic music and the opening sequence? The story is interesting, it isn't as slow as The Pink Panther or as ridiculous as Revenge of the Pink Panther which I did appreciate. The cast and comedy were what elevated this film though. The dialogue is very inspired especially Clousseau's wooing of Catherine Schell's Claudine with his chat up lines that are oddly reminiscent of the style of Humphrey Bogart. The slapstick is bumbling and always delivered, with the best scenes being Lytton's escape from the thugs, Clousseau's distraction during the bank robbery, Clousseau posing as a telephone repair man and especially the scene with the runaway vacuum cleaner. The characters are wonderfully crazy, and the acting is very good, as good as Catherine Schell, Herbert Lom(with his mental breakdown another highlight) and Christopher Plummer are, it is Peter Sellars who steals the show, his Clousseau as always is a riot. Overall, a great comedy and film. If there was anything that wasn't as good with the film, it was perhaps the length, the film could've done with being 5-10 minutes shorter. But it is a genuinely funny and well performed film and for me one of the better entries of the series. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    Picking up the role of Inspector Clouseau over a decade after A Shot in the Dark, Peter Sellers in this movie makes you wish he hadn't done something else for all that time. Though terribly plotted, The Return of the Pink Panther is filled with enough genuine hilarity that you won't really mind. The story is almost too simple. The legendary Pink Panther diamond is stolen from its home in the Middle Eastern country of Lugash, with evidence left behind implicating the almost-as-legendary jewel thief "The Phantom". The man who retrieved the diamond the first time it was stolen by The Phantom, Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers), is called into action, much to the chagrin of his dementedly frustrated boss, Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom). But it turns out that Sir Charles Litton (Christopher Plummer), the man who was The Phantom before retiring to please his young wife Claudine (Catherine Schell), is not responsible for the theft. Litton decides to head to Lugash to get to the bottom of the mystery while Clouseau is left to follow the Lady Litton to Switzerland as part of his own investigation. These Pink Panther movies are easy to review. Peter Sellers gives one of the greatest slapstick performances in cinema history as Clouseau, but there's not much else here. This one is essentially split in two, with Christopher Plummer doing a fairly good impersonation of Roger Moore, if James Bond were an international jewel thief, and Sellers just left to his own devices as Catherine Schell does little more than laugh at Clouseau's antics. Things are spiced up a bit with Herbert Lom's twitchy portrayal of Dreyfus' decent into madness over the colossal incompetence of his subordinate. I haven't the slightest idea why Blake Edwards thought anyone cared about Sir Charles Litton as much as Clouseau and while Edwards has his virtues as a storyteller, a sharp sense of pacing isn't one of them. This movie has a bloated and slack feel to it. Sellers is also noticeably less spry in the mid 70s than he was in the mid 60s. None of it matters all that much, because The Return of the Pink Panther has more than enough laughs, particularly Clouseau's battles with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk) and an epic struggle of Man vs. Lamp. This is a funny, family-friendly movie you should definitely watch with your kids when they're little.

    Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards reunite in this riotous comedy that is by far one of the better Pink Panther films. Sellers is on top form as Clouseau and nails every joke that Edwards sets up for them. A lot has been said about the relationship between the great actor and director but this film is a testament to how good they were together when on form. As always Herbert Lom is fantastic as Dreyfus and Burt Kwonk makes the martial art scenes a scream. Overall a fantastic entry to one of the best film comedy series of all time.

    Where Blake Edwards was once a handler of comedies combining slapstick, sophisticated wit, melancholia and social criticism, which was nearly forgotten by the time he's sold out this far into the eponymous franchise, because this one is just slapstick. Nothing else. He's mostly celebrated as the creator of the Pink Panther series. But this one's problem is how it drags. There isn't any anticipation felt or even created, any comic anguish, that nearly Hitchcockian suspense where time suddenly dilates to allow a burst of laughter. Other than the usual homage to the silent cinema of Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Leo McCarey, the Clouseau films seem to reveal preoccupations that come up again and again in Edwards' work. Clouseau is very much a hysterical white male and much of the series' humor comes from the ludicrous gap between his presumptions of cultural superiority and his idiotic behavior. He feels free to treat his Asian manservant Cato brutally, and proclaims his mastery over women, yet he is spectacularly inept at everything he attempts and is constantly humiliated. Clouseau's humiliations are particularly evident in a subtext of the films involving his predominant sexual embarrassment and failure. An elaborately original cartoon throughout the opening credits gets this amusingly distracting movie off to a lighthearted start before the bungling Inspector is asked by an Arab government to help them trace the Pink Panther diamond, which has been stolen from their theoretically impenetrable national museum. Clouseau deems the burglary to be the graft of Sir Charles Litton, a.k.a. The Phantom. To facilitate his own protection, the cunning Litton embarks on his own to recover the offender while his wife Claudine deflects Clouseau. The action is not so much a slapstick aficionado's ice cream castle as a slapstick aficionado's house of Cheetos. Our inelegant star is disengaged by defective vehicles, a telephone, a doorbell, revolving doors, a vacuum cleaner, a lamp, a parrot, and the exceedingly fanatical Cado who is provided with secret hiding places and surprise Kung Fu assaults. The sight gags come on like lightning and frantically, but the story line flies in several directions at once, where the original Pink Panther and A Shot in the Dark were methodically clever caper plots constructed out of their slapstick scenarios. Return of the Pink Panther is constructed right in synch with the brain's most rudimentary wavelengths, which is perhaps why it's a good house of Cheetos, a vegging-out flick.

    Peter Sellers returns as Inspector Clouseau after an 11 year absence, in this amusing sequel which finds the Pink Panther diamond being stolen again, and Clouseau is convinced that suspected jewel thief the Phantom is behind it, which means Sir Charles Litton(Christopher Plummer taking over from David Niven) is the prime suspect, along with his beautiful wife(played by Catherine Schell, though oddly, despite the end of the original film, doesn't seem to be Clouseau's ex-wife?) Herbert Lom again plays Dreyfeuss, and is portrayed as being on the verge of insanity. Burt Kwouk plays Cato, still trying to combat his employer Clouseau! Funny film has lots of inspired scenes, as Clouseau's disguises start to become elaborate. Leads directly into "...Strikes Again!"

    The third installment in the series begins when Inspector Clouseau is put on the case when the Pink Panther diamond is stolen, with the Phantom's trademark glove the only clue. Eleven years after the comedic masterpiece A Shot In The Dark, Peter Sellers returns as the bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau in another hysterical series of misadventures, that is known as, The Return Of The Pink Panther. In this movie, The Pink Panther returns...and so do the laughs! The third installment of the comedy series is a hysterical laugh fest, and that's not joke, the movie has got a lot of laughs, and when I mean laughs, I mean big laughs! The scenes in which Clouseau and Cato get into their brawls are hysterical enough, the scenes where Dreyfus keeps shooting himself are laugh filled too, and not to mention the scene where Clouseau is vacuuming the room and disaster ensues! In short, disaster ensues all over the place, it is the quintessential Pink Panther comedy film starring Peter Sellers! All in all, this is another big one for Peter Sellers, and Blake Edwards too! As he was in the two previous films, Peter Sellers is hilarious as the clumsy and bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau, who is trying to find The Pink Panther, and runs into mishaps at just about every turn! Christopher Plummer replaces David Niven as Sir Charles Litton, The Phantom. While Plummer was great, he in my opinion was a little too young for the role. Don't get me wrong, Plummer was great, but Niven was better. And of course, the late Herbert Lom delivers a wonderful performance as Clouseau's superior, Charles Dreyfus. By this time, Dreyfus is trying to get rid of Clouseau. And when I saw that, I don't mean firing him, I mean he wants to KILL him! In short, everybody in this movie is wonderful, with Sellers and Lom standing out the most. And as usual, the writing and directing from Blake Edwards is superb too. Blake Edwards was a comedic genius, and so was Peter Sellers, and when they worked together on this movie, they created another comedic masterpiece! All in all, The Return Of The Pink Panther is another great installment in the franchise, and it is another comedy gem brought to you by Blake Edwards (may he rest in peace). The series was great up until after Revenge Of The Pink Panther. After that, the series was finished, because Peter Sellers had died from a sudden heart attack. There is just no replacing Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau, there is only one Inspector Clouseau, and that is Peter Sellers. Even Blake Edwards said that it was a mistake to go on without Sellers. But anyway, this movie is hysterical, if you loved The Pink Panther and A Shot In The Dark, then what are you waiting for, you've got to see this hysterical third installment, as it will have you laughing yourself silly! You'll split your sides as you watch Inspector Clouseau get himself into a whole lot of trouble and mishaps, and you'll laugh even more when you see him trying to get out of them! 10/10

    Here is more like it, a true comedy with a screenplay that doesn't look ludicrous like that of A Shot In The Dark, and a plot that is so solid that makes you linger till the end to see what the outcome will be. Written, directed and produced by Blake Edwards this 1975 film in The Pink Panther series is breath taking funny and stands as one I will always remember. Inspector Clouseau fake exaggerated French accent is more pronounced in this movie, The Return of the Pink Panther than the previous and Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus mishaps were funnier than expected, that i found myself looking forward to his next unfortunate mishap. The chief instrument of his (other than the existence of Clouseasu) was his inability to tell which he was holding a gun or a lighter. The film stars Peter Sellers who reprises his role as Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The Return of the Pink Panther also stars the 84th Academy Award (2012) winner for best supporting actor (who became the oldest actor to win the award at age 82) Christopher Plummer who replaced David Niven as Sir Charles Lytton (the notorious Phantom). In this flick the Pink Panther diamond is now back in focus as it gets stolen again, and the man who was part responsible for finding it when it got stolen the first time, was called back to help recover the stolen diamond. The movie plot is funny to the core, with screenplays that will make you hold your ribs from bursting free. The late Blake Edwards (died in 2010) is known primarily for his comedies and this movie shows us why. The plot began in the fictional country of Lugash, a mysterious thief breaks into the National Museum, avoiding all the security pitfalls that were set in place for any prospective thief and steals the Pink Panther diamond. The mysterious thief left behind a calling card, which was a white monogrammed glove with a gold-tinted "P" on it. Feeling outwitted by the thief who was able to get pass the elaborated security system, put in place to secure the diamond, the Shah of Lugash requests the assistance of Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) to help them as they try to recover their national treasure. Clouseau on the other hand had been demoted to a beat cop, to patrol the streets. This was done by his boss, Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who despises Clouseau with a passion and dreams daily of killing him. This movie I do recommend to comedy lovers and I will proudly say this movie is better than the remake done by Steve Martin and Jean Reno in both 2006 and 2008. www.lagsreviews.com

    Return of the Pink Panther (1975) Complete with the great Mancini sax theme, the nutty smart Blake Edwards directing, the sassy cartoon panther himself, and of course Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau (taking on many absurd disguises). This is the third of the original Pink Panther movies series (omitting the oddball fourth one from 1968 that didn't have Mancini, Sellers, or Edwards), and it comes over a decade after the first two. Was the public interested? Yes--it did well. It was a great formula. Is it still a good formula in 2012? Good question. It depends on your taste. But surely the names repeated above are all cinema greats that, like Chaplin, rise above their time. But of course, Sellers, as terrific as he was, was no Charles Chaplin. At his best, the comedy is hilarious. And that makes the movie worth watching for sure. But he is sometimes a bit off in his timing, or is stuck playing a stunt that isn't worthy of him. There's also a lag in the filler material, the scenes between the great stuff. Some marginal characters (including the leading woman, who is totally a late 60s type, not a 1975 type, and she feels oddly unnecessary) don't command their parts, or their scenes. The drift begins to drift. And then you realize there isn't much of a plot. The whole recovery (sort of) of the famous Pink Panther diamond after an elaborate theft isn't really the driving force of the movie. What takes its place is a slow interplay of the characters all stumbling over each other trying to trick the perpetrator into revealing the gem. So then you are back to the stumbling as comedy, and sometimes it's great. There are so many ridiculous moments with Sellers being a bumbling fool like no one, you are sure to laugh. And that's what you're here for. "The Pink Panther" is the original, and at times also a bit sluggish, but it's the first. And "A Shot in the Dark" is the best of the three, I think. But if you like them, you'll be just fine here. If you haven't seen any, you might go in order, since the sets and music are really spot on in the first two, and a bit more transporting. There is something a little off kilter here that make it an awkward, but decent, third.

    The third installment in the series begins when Inspector Clouseau is put on the case when the Pink Panther diamond is stolen, with the Phantom's trademark glove the only clue. Eleven years after the comedic masterpiece A Shot In The Dark, Peter Sellers returns as the bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau in another hysterical series of misadventures, that is known as, The Return Of The Pink Panther. In this movie, The Pink Panther returns...and so do the laughs! The third installment of the comedy series is a hysterical laugh fest, and that's not joke, the movie has got a lot of laughs, and when I mean laughs, I mean big laughs! The scenes in which Clouseau and Cato get into their brawls are hysterical enough, the scenes where Dreyfus keeps shooting himself are laugh filled too, and not to mention the scene where Clouseau is vacuuming the room and disaster ensues! In short, disaster ensues all over the place, it is the quintessential Pink Panther comedy film starring Peter Sellers! All in all, this is another big one for Peter Sellers, and Blake Edwards too! As he was in the two previous films, Peter Sellers is hilarious as the clumsy and bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau, who is trying to find The Pink Panther, and runs into mishaps at just about every turn! Christopher Plummer replaces David Niven as Sir Charles Litton, The Phantom. While Plummer was great, he in my opinion was a little too young for the role. Don't get me wrong, Plummer was great, but Niven was better. And of course, the late Herbert Lom delivers a wonderful performance as Clouseau's superior, Charles Dreyfus. By this time, Dreyfus is trying to get rid of Clouseau. And when I saw that, I don't mean firing him, I mean he wants to KILL him! In short, everybody in this movie is wonderful, with Sellers and Lom standing out the most. And as usual, the writing and directing from Blake Edwards is superb too. Blake Edwards was a comedic genius, and so was Peter Sellers, and when they worked together on this movie, they created another comedic masterpiece! All in all, The Return Of The Pink Panther is another great installment in the franchise, and it is another comedy gem brought to you by Blake Edwards (may he rest in peace). The series was great up until after Revenge Of The Pink Panther. After that, the series was finished, because Peter Sellers had died from a sudden heart attack. There is just no replacing Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau, there is only one Inspector Clouseau, and that is Peter Sellers. Even Blake Edwards said that it was a mistake to go on without Sellers. But anyway, this movie is hysterical, if you loved The Pink Panther and A Shot In The Dark, then what are you waiting for, you've got to see this hysterical third installment, as it will have you laughing yourself silly! You'll split your sides as you watch Inspector Clouseau get himself into a whole lot of trouble and mishaps, and you'll laugh even more when you see him trying to get out of them! 10/10

    Here is more like it, a true comedy with a screenplay that doesn't look ludicrous like that of A Shot In The Dark, and a plot that is so solid that makes you linger till the end to see what the outcome will be. Written, directed and produced by Blake Edwards this 1975 film in The Pink Panther series is breath taking funny and stands as one I will always remember. Inspector Clouseau fake exaggerated French accent is more pronounced in this movie, The Return of the Pink Panther than the previous and Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus mishaps were funnier than expected, that i found myself looking forward to his next unfortunate mishap. The chief instrument of his (other than the existence of Clouseasu) was his inability to tell which he was holding a gun or a lighter. The film stars Peter Sellers who reprises his role as Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The Return of the Pink Panther also stars the 84th Academy Award (2012) winner for best supporting actor (who became the oldest actor to win the award at age 82) Christopher Plummer who replaced David Niven as Sir Charles Lytton (the notorious Phantom). In this flick the Pink Panther diamond is now back in focus as it gets stolen again, and the man who was part responsible for finding it when it got stolen the first time, was called back to help recover the stolen diamond. The movie plot is funny to the core, with screenplays that will make you hold your ribs from bursting free. The late Blake Edwards (died in 2010) is known primarily for his comedies and this movie shows us why. The plot began in the fictional country of Lugash, a mysterious thief breaks into the National Museum, avoiding all the security pitfalls that were set in place for any prospective thief and steals the Pink Panther diamond. The mysterious thief left behind a calling card, which was a white monogrammed glove with a gold-tinted "P" on it. Feeling outwitted by the thief who was able to get pass the elaborated security system, put in place to secure the diamond, the Shah of Lugash requests the assistance of Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) to help them as they try to recover their national treasure. Clouseau on the other hand had been demoted to a beat cop, to patrol the streets. This was done by his boss, Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who despises Clouseau with a passion and dreams daily of killing him. This movie I do recommend to comedy lovers and I will proudly say this movie is better than the remake done by Steve Martin and Jean Reno in both 2006 and 2008. www.lagsreviews.com

    Return of the Pink Panther (1975) Complete with the great Mancini sax theme, the nutty smart Blake Edwards directing, the sassy cartoon panther himself, and of course Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau (taking on many absurd disguises). This is the third of the original Pink Panther movies series (omitting the oddball fourth one from 1968 that didn't have Mancini, Sellers, or Edwards), and it comes over a decade after the first two. Was the public interested? Yes--it did well. It was a great formula. Is it still a good formula in 2012? Good question. It depends on your taste. But surely the names repeated above are all cinema greats that, like Chaplin, rise above their time. But of course, Sellers, as terrific as he was, was no Charles Chaplin. At his best, the comedy is hilarious. And that makes the movie worth watching for sure. But he is sometimes a bit off in his timing, or is stuck playing a stunt that isn't worthy of him. There's also a lag in the filler material, the scenes between the great stuff. Some marginal characters (including the leading woman, who is totally a late 60s type, not a 1975 type, and she feels oddly unnecessary) don't command their parts, or their scenes. The drift begins to drift. And then you realize there isn't much of a plot. The whole recovery (sort of) of the famous Pink Panther diamond after an elaborate theft isn't really the driving force of the movie. What takes its place is a slow interplay of the characters all stumbling over each other trying to trick the perpetrator into revealing the gem. So then you are back to the stumbling as comedy, and sometimes it's great. There are so many ridiculous moments with Sellers being a bumbling fool like no one, you are sure to laugh. And that's what you're here for. "The Pink Panther" is the original, and at times also a bit sluggish, but it's the first. And "A Shot in the Dark" is the best of the three, I think. But if you like them, you'll be just fine here. If you haven't seen any, you might go in order, since the sets and music are really spot on in the first two, and a bit more transporting. There is something a little off kilter here that make it an awkward, but decent, third.

    Ironically, the best part of the movie isn't any of the comic scenes, but the part at the beginning depicting the elaborate way the thief gets past all the traps to steal the Pink Panther jewel. While the comic scenes with Clouseau are funny, they don't all necessarily add to the storyline. In "A Shot In The Dark", Clouseau's repeated gaffes serve to ultimately drive Commissioner Dreyfus crazy; in this movie, most of them seem to just serve as filler entertainment, such as the part where he is disguised as a hotel room cleaner and has everything go wrong when he tries to do that job. The movie's other major problem is that Christopher Plummer was a poor substitute for David Niven as the Phantom. Niven was suave and cool; Plummer was a thuggish brute who resorted to breaking bones-rather unlike how a suave cat burglar is supposed to behave. This could have been a much better movie than it was.

    As a preamble I must confess that Sellers' mere appearance on screen as the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau reduces me to tears of laughter. My dear late wife would admonish me when often I alone in the theater would burst into laughter when Clouseau would merely saunter onto the screen in his smug superior fashion as in the beginning of this movie in the organ grinder scene. Sellers, in the sequels to the Shot in the Dark movie really camped up Clouseau, especially the fractured "French" accent which even the other characters cannot fathom. Make no mistake, this movie is all about Sellers and Clouseau doing physical, farcical, and dialog comedy. Also hilarious is Herbert Lom's portrayal of Dreyfous, Clouseau's boss, who is eventually driven literally mad by Clouseau as the Panther movies progress. This movie is superior to the later sequels and even if you are not a Sellers fan worth seeing. For those of you who are fans of Sellers, this is a must see movie revolving around one of the most funny, iconic, comedic characters ever portrayed on film.

    I enjoy a vast majority of the Pink Panther movies with Peter Sellars, with A Shot in the Dark being my personal favourite. The Return of the Pink Panther is for me the second best of the series, and one of the funnier entries. The production values are wonderful with striking cinematography and elegant locations and costumes. And who can forget Henry Mancini's iconic music and the opening sequence? The story is interesting, it isn't as slow as The Pink Panther or as ridiculous as Revenge of the Pink Panther which I did appreciate. The cast and comedy were what elevated this film though. The dialogue is very inspired especially Clousseau's wooing of Catherine Schell's Claudine with his chat up lines that are oddly reminiscent of the style of Humphrey Bogart. The slapstick is bumbling and always delivered, with the best scenes being Lytton's escape from the thugs, Clousseau's distraction during the bank robbery, Clousseau posing as a telephone repair man and especially the scene with the runaway vacuum cleaner. The characters are wonderfully crazy, and the acting is very good, as good as Catherine Schell, Herbert Lom(with his mental breakdown another highlight) and Christopher Plummer are, it is Peter Sellars who steals the show, his Clousseau as always is a riot. Overall, a great comedy and film. If there was anything that wasn't as good with the film, it was perhaps the length, the film could've done with being 5-10 minutes shorter. But it is a genuinely funny and well performed film and for me one of the better entries of the series. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    Picking up the role of Inspector Clouseau over a decade after A Shot in the Dark, Peter Sellers in this movie makes you wish he hadn't done something else for all that time. Though terribly plotted, The Return of the Pink Panther is filled with enough genuine hilarity that you won't really mind. The story is almost too simple. The legendary Pink Panther diamond is stolen from its home in the Middle Eastern country of Lugash, with evidence left behind implicating the almost-as-legendary jewel thief "The Phantom". The man who retrieved the diamond the first time it was stolen by The Phantom, Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers), is called into action, much to the chagrin of his dementedly frustrated boss, Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom). But it turns out that Sir Charles Litton (Christopher Plummer), the man who was The Phantom before retiring to please his young wife Claudine (Catherine Schell), is not responsible for the theft. Litton decides to head to Lugash to get to the bottom of the mystery while Clouseau is left to follow the Lady Litton to Switzerland as part of his own investigation. These Pink Panther movies are easy to review. Peter Sellers gives one of the greatest slapstick performances in cinema history as Clouseau, but there's not much else here. This one is essentially split in two, with Christopher Plummer doing a fairly good impersonation of Roger Moore, if James Bond were an international jewel thief, and Sellers just left to his own devices as Catherine Schell does little more than laugh at Clouseau's antics. Things are spiced up a bit with Herbert Lom's twitchy portrayal of Dreyfus' decent into madness over the colossal incompetence of his subordinate. I haven't the slightest idea why Blake Edwards thought anyone cared about Sir Charles Litton as much as Clouseau and while Edwards has his virtues as a storyteller, a sharp sense of pacing isn't one of them. This movie has a bloated and slack feel to it. Sellers is also noticeably less spry in the mid 70s than he was in the mid 60s. None of it matters all that much, because The Return of the Pink Panther has more than enough laughs, particularly Clouseau's battles with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk) and an epic struggle of Man vs. Lamp. This is a funny, family-friendly movie you should definitely watch with your kids when they're little.

    Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards reunite in this riotous comedy that is by far one of the better Pink Panther films. Sellers is on top form as Clouseau and nails every joke that Edwards sets up for them. A lot has been said about the relationship between the great actor and director but this film is a testament to how good they were together when on form. As always Herbert Lom is fantastic as Dreyfus and Burt Kwonk makes the martial art scenes a scream. Overall a fantastic entry to one of the best film comedy series of all time.

    Where Blake Edwards was once a handler of comedies combining slapstick, sophisticated wit, melancholia and social criticism, which was nearly forgotten by the time he's sold out this far into the eponymous franchise, because this one is just slapstick. Nothing else. He's mostly celebrated as the creator of the Pink Panther series. But this one's problem is how it drags. There isn't any anticipation felt or even created, any comic anguish, that nearly Hitchcockian suspense where time suddenly dilates to allow a burst of laughter. Other than the usual homage to the silent cinema of Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Leo McCarey, the Clouseau films seem to reveal preoccupations that come up again and again in Edwards' work. Clouseau is very much a hysterical white male and much of the series' humor comes from the ludicrous gap between his presumptions of cultural superiority and his idiotic behavior. He feels free to treat his Asian manservant Cato brutally, and proclaims his mastery over women, yet he is spectacularly inept at everything he attempts and is constantly humiliated. Clouseau's humiliations are particularly evident in a subtext of the films involving his predominant sexual embarrassment and failure. An elaborately original cartoon throughout the opening credits gets this amusingly distracting movie off to a lighthearted start before the bungling Inspector is asked by an Arab government to help them trace the Pink Panther diamond, which has been stolen from their theoretically impenetrable national museum. Clouseau deems the burglary to be the graft of Sir Charles Litton, a.k.a. The Phantom. To facilitate his own protection, the cunning Litton embarks on his own to recover the offender while his wife Claudine deflects Clouseau. The action is not so much a slapstick aficionado's ice cream castle as a slapstick aficionado's house of Cheetos. Our inelegant star is disengaged by defective vehicles, a telephone, a doorbell, revolving doors, a vacuum cleaner, a lamp, a parrot, and the exceedingly fanatical Cado who is provided with secret hiding places and surprise Kung Fu assaults. The sight gags come on like lightning and frantically, but the story line flies in several directions at once, where the original Pink Panther and A Shot in the Dark were methodically clever caper plots constructed out of their slapstick scenarios. Return of the Pink Panther is constructed right in synch with the brain's most rudimentary wavelengths, which is perhaps why it's a good house of Cheetos, a vegging-out flick.

    Peter Sellers returns as Inspector Clouseau after an 11 year absence, in this amusing sequel which finds the Pink Panther diamond being stolen again, and Clouseau is convinced that suspected jewel thief the Phantom is behind it, which means Sir Charles Litton(Christopher Plummer taking over from David Niven) is the prime suspect, along with his beautiful wife(played by Catherine Schell, though oddly, despite the end of the original film, doesn't seem to be Clouseau's ex-wife?) Herbert Lom again plays Dreyfeuss, and is portrayed as being on the verge of insanity. Burt Kwouk plays Cato, still trying to combat his employer Clouseau! Funny film has lots of inspired scenes, as Clouseau's disguises start to become elaborate. Leads directly into "...Strikes Again!"

    The third installment in the series begins when Inspector Clouseau is put on the case when the Pink Panther diamond is stolen, with the Phantom's trademark glove the only clue. Eleven years after the comedic masterpiece A Shot In The Dark, Peter Sellers returns as the bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau in another hysterical series of misadventures, that is known as, The Return Of The Pink Panther. In this movie, The Pink Panther returns...and so do the laughs! The third installment of the comedy series is a hysterical laugh fest, and that's not joke, the movie has got a lot of laughs, and when I mean laughs, I mean big laughs! The scenes in which Clouseau and Cato get into their brawls are hysterical enough, the scenes where Dreyfus keeps shooting himself are laugh filled too, and not to mention the scene where Clouseau is vacuuming the room and disaster ensues! In short, disaster ensues all over the place, it is the quintessential Pink Panther comedy film starring Peter Sellers! All in all, this is another big one for Peter Sellers, and Blake Edwards too! As he was in the two previous films, Peter Sellers is hilarious as the clumsy and bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau, who is trying to find The Pink Panther, and runs into mishaps at just about every turn! Christopher Plummer replaces David Niven as Sir Charles Litton, The Phantom. While Plummer was great, he in my opinion was a little too young for the role. Don't get me wrong, Plummer was great, but Niven was better. And of course, the late Herbert Lom delivers a wonderful performance as Clouseau's superior, Charles Dreyfus. By this time, Dreyfus is trying to get rid of Clouseau. And when I saw that, I don't mean firing him, I mean he wants to KILL him! In short, everybody in this movie is wonderful, with Sellers and Lom standing out the most. And as usual, the writing and directing from Blake Edwards is superb too. Blake Edwards was a comedic genius, and so was Peter Sellers, and when they worked together on this movie, they created another comedic masterpiece! All in all, The Return Of The Pink Panther is another great installment in the franchise, and it is another comedy gem brought to you by Blake Edwards (may he rest in peace). The series was great up until after Revenge Of The Pink Panther. After that, the series was finished, because Peter Sellers had died from a sudden heart attack. There is just no replacing Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau, there is only one Inspector Clouseau, and that is Peter Sellers. Even Blake Edwards said that it was a mistake to go on without Sellers. But anyway, this movie is hysterical, if you loved The Pink Panther and A Shot In The Dark, then what are you waiting for, you've got to see this hysterical third installment, as it will have you laughing yourself silly! You'll split your sides as you watch Inspector Clouseau get himself into a whole lot of trouble and mishaps, and you'll laugh even more when you see him trying to get out of them! 10/10

    Picking up the role of Inspector Clouseau over a decade after A Shot in the Dark, Peter Sellers in this movie makes you wish he hadn't done something else for all that time. Though terribly plotted, The Return of the Pink Panther is filled with enough genuine hilarity that you won't really mind. The story is almost too simple. The legendary Pink Panther diamond is stolen from its home in the Middle Eastern country of Lugash, with evidence left behind implicating the almost-as-legendary jewel thief "The Phantom". The man who retrieved the diamond the first time it was stolen by The Phantom, Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers), is called into action, much to the chagrin of his dementedly frustrated boss, Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom). But it turns out that Sir Charles Litton (Christopher Plummer), the man who was The Phantom before retiring to please his young wife Claudine (Catherine Schell), is not responsible for the theft. Litton decides to head to Lugash to get to the bottom of the mystery while Clouseau is left to follow the Lady Litton to Switzerland as part of his own investigation. These Pink Panther movies are easy to review. Peter Sellers gives one of the greatest slapstick performances in cinema history as Clouseau, but there's not much else here. This one is essentially split in two, with Christopher Plummer doing a fairly good impersonation of Roger Moore, if James Bond were an international jewel thief, and Sellers just left to his own devices as Catherine Schell does little more than laugh at Clouseau's antics. Things are spiced up a bit with Herbert Lom's twitchy portrayal of Dreyfus' decent into madness over the colossal incompetence of his subordinate. I haven't the slightest idea why Blake Edwards thought anyone cared about Sir Charles Litton as much as Clouseau and while Edwards has his virtues as a storyteller, a sharp sense of pacing isn't one of them. This movie has a bloated and slack feel to it. Sellers is also noticeably less spry in the mid 70s than he was in the mid 60s. None of it matters all that much, because The Return of the Pink Panther has more than enough laughs, particularly Clouseau's battles with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk) and an epic struggle of Man vs. Lamp. This is a funny, family-friendly movie you should definitely watch with your kids when they're little.

    Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards reunite in this riotous comedy that is by far one of the better Pink Panther films. Sellers is on top form as Clouseau and nails every joke that Edwards sets up for them. A lot has been said about the relationship between the great actor and director but this film is a testament to how good they were together when on form. As always Herbert Lom is fantastic as Dreyfus and Burt Kwonk makes the martial art scenes a scream. Overall a fantastic entry to one of the best film comedy series of all time.

    Where Blake Edwards was once a handler of comedies combining slapstick, sophisticated wit, melancholia and social criticism, which was nearly forgotten by the time he's sold out this far into the eponymous franchise, because this one is just slapstick. Nothing else. He's mostly celebrated as the creator of the Pink Panther series. But this one's problem is how it drags. There isn't any anticipation felt or even created, any comic anguish, that nearly Hitchcockian suspense where time suddenly dilates to allow a burst of laughter. Other than the usual homage to the silent cinema of Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Leo McCarey, the Clouseau films seem to reveal preoccupations that come up again and again in Edwards' work. Clouseau is very much a hysterical white male and much of the series' humor comes from the ludicrous gap between his presumptions of cultural superiority and his idiotic behavior. He feels free to treat his Asian manservant Cato brutally, and proclaims his mastery over women, yet he is spectacularly inept at everything he attempts and is constantly humiliated. Clouseau's humiliations are particularly evident in a subtext of the films involving his predominant sexual embarrassment and failure. An elaborately original cartoon throughout the opening credits gets this amusingly distracting movie off to a lighthearted start before the bungling Inspector is asked by an Arab government to help them trace the Pink Panther diamond, which has been stolen from their theoretically impenetrable national museum. Clouseau deems the burglary to be the graft of Sir Charles Litton, a.k.a. The Phantom. To facilitate his own protection, the cunning Litton embarks on his own to recover the offender while his wife Claudine deflects Clouseau. The action is not so much a slapstick aficionado's ice cream castle as a slapstick aficionado's house of Cheetos. Our inelegant star is disengaged by defective vehicles, a telephone, a doorbell, revolving doors, a vacuum cleaner, a lamp, a parrot, and the exceedingly fanatical Cado who is provided with secret hiding places and surprise Kung Fu assaults. The sight gags come on like lightning and frantically, but the story line flies in several directions at once, where the original Pink Panther and A Shot in the Dark were methodically clever caper plots constructed out of their slapstick scenarios. Return of the Pink Panther is constructed right in synch with the brain's most rudimentary wavelengths, which is perhaps why it's a good house of Cheetos, a vegging-out flick.

    Peter Sellers returns as Inspector Clouseau after an 11 year absence, in this amusing sequel which finds the Pink Panther diamond being stolen again, and Clouseau is convinced that suspected jewel thief the Phantom is behind it, which means Sir Charles Litton(Christopher Plummer taking over from David Niven) is the prime suspect, along with his beautiful wife(played by Catherine Schell, though oddly, despite the end of the original film, doesn't seem to be Clouseau's ex-wife?) Herbert Lom again plays Dreyfeuss, and is portrayed as being on the verge of insanity. Burt Kwouk plays Cato, still trying to combat his employer Clouseau! Funny film has lots of inspired scenes, as Clouseau's disguises start to become elaborate. Leads directly into "...Strikes Again!"

    The third installment in the series begins when Inspector Clouseau is put on the case when the Pink Panther diamond is stolen, with the Phantom's trademark glove the only clue. Eleven years after the comedic masterpiece A Shot In The Dark, Peter Sellers returns as the bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau in another hysterical series of misadventures, that is known as, The Return Of The Pink Panther. In this movie, The Pink Panther returns...and so do the laughs! The third installment of the comedy series is a hysterical laugh fest, and that's not joke, the movie has got a lot of laughs, and when I mean laughs, I mean big laughs! The scenes in which Clouseau and Cato get into their brawls are hysterical enough, the scenes where Dreyfus keeps shooting himself are laugh filled too, and not to mention the scene where Clouseau is vacuuming the room and disaster ensues! In short, disaster ensues all over the place, it is the quintessential Pink Panther comedy film starring Peter Sellers! All in all, this is another big one for Peter Sellers, and Blake Edwards too! As he was in the two previous films, Peter Sellers is hilarious as the clumsy and bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau, who is trying to find The Pink Panther, and runs into mishaps at just about every turn! Christopher Plummer replaces David Niven as Sir Charles Litton, The Phantom. While Plummer was great, he in my opinion was a little too young for the role. Don't get me wrong, Plummer was great, but Niven was better. And of course, the late Herbert Lom delivers a wonderful performance as Clouseau's superior, Charles Dreyfus. By this time, Dreyfus is trying to get rid of Clouseau. And when I saw that, I don't mean firing him, I mean he wants to KILL him! In short, everybody in this movie is wonderful, with Sellers and Lom standing out the most. And as usual, the writing and directing from Blake Edwards is superb too. Blake Edwards was a comedic genius, and so was Peter Sellers, and when they worked together on this movie, they created another comedic masterpiece! All in all, The Return Of The Pink Panther is another great installment in the franchise, and it is another comedy gem brought to you by Blake Edwards (may he rest in peace). The series was great up until after Revenge Of The Pink Panther. After that, the series was finished, because Peter Sellers had died from a sudden heart attack. There is just no replacing Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau, there is only one Inspector Clouseau, and that is Peter Sellers. Even Blake Edwards said that it was a mistake to go on without Sellers. But anyway, this movie is hysterical, if you loved The Pink Panther and A Shot In The Dark, then what are you waiting for, you've got to see this hysterical third installment, as it will have you laughing yourself silly! You'll split your sides as you watch Inspector Clouseau get himself into a whole lot of trouble and mishaps, and you'll laugh even more when you see him trying to get out of them! 10/10

    Here is more like it, a true comedy with a screenplay that doesn't look ludicrous like that of A Shot In The Dark, and a plot that is so solid that makes you linger till the end to see what the outcome will be. Written, directed and produced by Blake Edwards this 1975 film in The Pink Panther series is breath taking funny and stands as one I will always remember. Inspector Clouseau fake exaggerated French accent is more pronounced in this movie, The Return of the Pink Panther than the previous and Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus mishaps were funnier than expected, that i found myself looking forward to his next unfortunate mishap. The chief instrument of his (other than the existence of Clouseasu) was his inability to tell which he was holding a gun or a lighter. The film stars Peter Sellers who reprises his role as Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The Return of the Pink Panther also stars the 84th Academy Award (2012) winner for best supporting actor (who became the oldest actor to win the award at age 82) Christopher Plummer who replaced David Niven as Sir Charles Lytton (the notorious Phantom). In this flick the Pink Panther diamond is now back in focus as it gets stolen again, and the man who was part responsible for finding it when it got stolen the first time, was called back to help recover the stolen diamond. The movie plot is funny to the core, with screenplays that will make you hold your ribs from bursting free. The late Blake Edwards (died in 2010) is known primarily for his comedies and this movie shows us why. The plot began in the fictional country of Lugash, a mysterious thief breaks into the National Museum, avoiding all the security pitfalls that were set in place for any prospective thief and steals the Pink Panther diamond. The mysterious thief left behind a calling card, which was a white monogrammed glove with a gold-tinted "P" on it. Feeling outwitted by the thief who was able to get pass the elaborated security system, put in place to secure the diamond, the Shah of Lugash requests the assistance of Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) to help them as they try to recover their national treasure. Clouseau on the other hand had been demoted to a beat cop, to patrol the streets. This was done by his boss, Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who despises Clouseau with a passion and dreams daily of killing him. This movie I do recommend to comedy lovers and I will proudly say this movie is better than the remake done by Steve Martin and Jean Reno in both 2006 and 2008. www.lagsreviews.com

    Return of the Pink Panther (1975) Complete with the great Mancini sax theme, the nutty smart Blake Edwards directing, the sassy cartoon panther himself, and of course Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau (taking on many absurd disguises). This is the third of the original Pink Panther movies series (omitting the oddball fourth one from 1968 that didn't have Mancini, Sellers, or Edwards), and it comes over a decade after the first two. Was the public interested? Yes--it did well. It was a great formula. Is it still a good formula in 2012? Good question. It depends on your taste. But surely the names repeated above are all cinema greats that, like Chaplin, rise above their time. But of course, Sellers, as terrific as he was, was no Charles Chaplin. At his best, the comedy is hilarious. And that makes the movie worth watching for sure. But he is sometimes a bit off in his timing, or is stuck playing a stunt that isn't worthy of him. There's also a lag in the filler material, the scenes between the great stuff. Some marginal characters (including the leading woman, who is totally a late 60s type, not a 1975 type, and she feels oddly unnecessary) don't command their parts, or their scenes. The drift begins to drift. And then you realize there isn't much of a plot. The whole recovery (sort of) of the famous Pink Panther diamond after an elaborate theft isn't really the driving force of the movie. What takes its place is a slow interplay of the characters all stumbling over each other trying to trick the perpetrator into revealing the gem. So then you are back to the stumbling as comedy, and sometimes it's great. There are so many ridiculous moments with Sellers being a bumbling fool like no one, you are sure to laugh. And that's what you're here for. "The Pink Panther" is the original, and at times also a bit sluggish, but it's the first. And "A Shot in the Dark" is the best of the three, I think. But if you like them, you'll be just fine here. If you haven't seen any, you might go in order, since the sets and music are really spot on in the first two, and a bit more transporting. There is something a little off kilter here that make it an awkward, but decent, third.

    Ironically, the best part of the movie isn't any of the comic scenes, but the part at the beginning depicting the elaborate way the thief gets past all the traps to steal the Pink Panther jewel. While the comic scenes with Clouseau are funny, they don't all necessarily add to the storyline. In "A Shot In The Dark", Clouseau's repeated gaffes serve to ultimately drive Commissioner Dreyfus crazy; in this movie, most of them seem to just serve as filler entertainment, such as the part where he is disguised as a hotel room cleaner and has everything go wrong when he tries to do that job. The movie's other major problem is that Christopher Plummer was a poor substitute for David Niven as the Phantom. Niven was suave and cool; Plummer was a thuggish brute who resorted to breaking bones-rather unlike how a suave cat burglar is supposed to behave. This could have been a much better movie than it was.

    As a preamble I must confess that Sellers' mere appearance on screen as the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau reduces me to tears of laughter. My dear late wife would admonish me when often I alone in the theater would burst into laughter when Clouseau would merely saunter onto the screen in his smug superior fashion as in the beginning of this movie in the organ grinder scene. Sellers, in the sequels to the Shot in the Dark movie really camped up Clouseau, especially the fractured "French" accent which even the other characters cannot fathom. Make no mistake, this movie is all about Sellers and Clouseau doing physical, farcical, and dialog comedy. Also hilarious is Herbert Lom's portrayal of Dreyfous, Clouseau's boss, who is eventually driven literally mad by Clouseau as the Panther movies progress. This movie is superior to the later sequels and even if you are not a Sellers fan worth seeing. For those of you who are fans of Sellers, this is a must see movie revolving around one of the most funny, iconic, comedic characters ever portrayed on film.

    I enjoy a vast majority of the Pink Panther movies with Peter Sellars, with A Shot in the Dark being my personal favourite. The Return of the Pink Panther is for me the second best of the series, and one of the funnier entries. The production values are wonderful with striking cinematography and elegant locations and costumes. And who can forget Henry Mancini's iconic music and the opening sequence? The story is interesting, it isn't as slow as The Pink Panther or as ridiculous as Revenge of the Pink Panther which I did appreciate. The cast and comedy were what elevated this film though. The dialogue is very inspired especially Clousseau's wooing of Catherine Schell's Claudine with his chat up lines that are oddly reminiscent of the style of Humphrey Bogart. The slapstick is bumbling and always delivered, with the best scenes being Lytton's escape from the thugs, Clousseau's distraction during the bank robbery, Clousseau posing as a telephone repair man and especially the scene with the runaway vacuum cleaner. The characters are wonderfully crazy, and the acting is very good, as good as Catherine Schell, Herbert Lom(with his mental breakdown another highlight) and Christopher Plummer are, it is Peter Sellars who steals the show, his Clousseau as always is a riot. Overall, a great comedy and film. If there was anything that wasn't as good with the film, it was perhaps the length, the film could've done with being 5-10 minutes shorter. But it is a genuinely funny and well performed film and for me one of the better entries of the series. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    The third installment in the series begins when Inspector Clouseau is put on the case when the Pink Panther diamond is stolen, with the Phantom's trademark glove the only clue. Eleven years after the comedic masterpiece A Shot In The Dark, Peter Sellers returns as the bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau in another hysterical series of misadventures, that is known as, The Return Of The Pink Panther. In this movie, The Pink Panther returns...and so do the laughs! The third installment of the comedy series is a hysterical laugh fest, and that's not joke, the movie has got a lot of laughs, and when I mean laughs, I mean big laughs! The scenes in which Clouseau and Cato get into their brawls are hysterical enough, the scenes where Dreyfus keeps shooting himself are laugh filled too, and not to mention the scene where Clouseau is vacuuming the room and disaster ensues! In short, disaster ensues all over the place, it is the quintessential Pink Panther comedy film starring Peter Sellers! All in all, this is another big one for Peter Sellers, and Blake Edwards too! As he was in the two previous films, Peter Sellers is hilarious as the clumsy and bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau, who is trying to find The Pink Panther, and runs into mishaps at just about every turn! Christopher Plummer replaces David Niven as Sir Charles Litton, The Phantom. While Plummer was great, he in my opinion was a little too young for the role. Don't get me wrong, Plummer was great, but Niven was better. And of course, the late Herbert Lom delivers a wonderful performance as Clouseau's superior, Charles Dreyfus. By this time, Dreyfus is trying to get rid of Clouseau. And when I saw that, I don't mean firing him, I mean he wants to KILL him! In short, everybody in this movie is wonderful, with Sellers and Lom standing out the most. And as usual, the writing and directing from Blake Edwards is superb too. Blake Edwards was a comedic genius, and so was Peter Sellers, and when they worked together on this movie, they created another comedic masterpiece! All in all, The Return Of The Pink Panther is another great installment in the franchise, and it is another comedy gem brought to you by Blake Edwards (may he rest in peace). The series was great up until after Revenge Of The Pink Panther. After that, the series was finished, because Peter Sellers had died from a sudden heart attack. There is just no replacing Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau, there is only one Inspector Clouseau, and that is Peter Sellers. Even Blake Edwards said that it was a mistake to go on without Sellers. But anyway, this movie is hysterical, if you loved The Pink Panther and A Shot In The Dark, then what are you waiting for, you've got to see this hysterical third installment, as it will have you laughing yourself silly! You'll split your sides as you watch Inspector Clouseau get himself into a whole lot of trouble and mishaps, and you'll laugh even more when you see him trying to get out of them! 10/10

    Here is more like it, a true comedy with a screenplay that doesn't look ludicrous like that of A Shot In The Dark, and a plot that is so solid that makes you linger till the end to see what the outcome will be.

Clouseau on the other hand had been demoted to a beat cop, to patrol the streets. This was done by his boss, Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who despises Clouseau with a passion and dreams daily of killing him. This movie I do recommend to comedy lovers and I will proudly say this movie is better than the remake done by Steve Martin and Jean Reno in both 2006 and 2008. www.lagsreviews.com

    Return of the Pink Panther (1975) Complete with the great Mancini sax theme, the nutty smart Blake Edwards directing, the sassy cartoon panther himself, and of course Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau (taking on many absurd disguises). This is the third of the original Pink Panther movies series (omitting the oddball fourth one from 1968 that didn't have Mancini, Sellers, or Edwards), and it comes over a decade after the first two. Was the public interested? Yes--it did well. It was a great formula. Is it still a good formula in 2012? Good question. It depends on your taste. But surely the names repeated above are all cinema greats that, like Chaplin, rise above their time. But of course, Sellers, as terrific as he was, was no Charles Chaplin. At his best, the comedy is hilarious. And that makes the movie worth watching for sure. But he is sometimes a bit off in his timing, or is stuck playing a stunt that isn't worthy of him. There's also a lag in the filler material, the scenes between the great stuff. Some marginal characters (including the leading woman, who is totally a late 60s type, not a 1975 type, and she feels oddly unnecessary) don't command their parts, or their scenes. The drift begins to drift. And then you realize there isn't much of a plot. The whole recovery (sort of) of the famous Pink Panther diamond after an elaborate theft isn't really the driving force of the movie. What takes its place is a slow interplay of the characters all stumbling over each other trying to trick the perpetrator into revealing the gem. So then you are back to the stumbling as comedy, and sometimes it's great. There are so many ridiculous moments with Sellers being a bumbling fool like no one, you are sure to laugh. And that's what you're here for. "The Pink Panther" is the original, and at times also a bit sluggish, but it's the first. And "A Shot in the Dark" is the best of the three, I think. But if you like them, you'll be just fine here. If you haven't seen any, you might go in order, since the sets and music are really spot on in the first two, and a bit more transporting. There is something a little off kilter here that make it an awkward, but decent, third.

    Ironically, the best part of the movie isn't any of the comic scenes, but the part at the beginning depicting the elaborate way the thief gets past all the traps to steal the Pink Panther jewel. While the comic scenes with Clouseau are funny, they don't all necessarily add to the storyline. In "A Shot In The Dark", Clouseau's repeated gaffes serve to ultimately drive Commissioner Dreyfus crazy; in this movie, most of them seem to just serve as filler entertainment, such as the part where he is disguised as a hotel room cleaner and has everything go wrong when he tries to do that job. The movie's other major problem is that Christopher Plummer was a poor substitute for David Niven as the Phantom. Niven was suave and cool; Plummer was a thuggish brute who resorted to breaking bones-rather unlike how a suave cat burglar is supposed to behave. This could have been a much better movie than it was.

    As a preamble I must confess that Sellers' mere appearance on screen as the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau reduces me to tears of laughter. My dear late wife would admonish me when often I alone in the theater would burst into laughter when Clouseau would merely saunter onto the screen in his smug superior fashion as in the beginning of this movie in the organ grinder scene. Sellers, in the sequels to the Shot in the Dark movie really camped up Clouseau, especially the fractured "French" accent which even the other characters cannot fathom. Make no mistake, this movie is all about Sellers and Clouseau doing physical, farcical, and dialog comedy. Also hilarious is Herbert Lom's portrayal of Dreyfous, Clouseau's boss, who is eventually driven literally mad by Clouseau as the Panther movies progress. This movie is superior to the later sequels and even if you are not a Sellers fan worth seeing. For those of you who are fans of Sellers, this is a must see movie revolving around one of the most funny, iconic, comedic characters ever portrayed on film.

    I enjoy a vast majority of the Pink Panther movies with Peter Sellars, with A Shot in the Dark being my personal favourite. The Return of the Pink Panther is for me the second best of the series, and one of the funnier entries. The production values are wonderful with striking cinematography and elegant locations and costumes. And who can forget Henry Mancini's iconic music and the opening sequence? The story is interesting, it isn't as slow as The Pink Panther or as ridiculous as Revenge of the Pink Panther which I did appreciate. The cast and comedy were what elevated this film though. The dialogue is very inspired especially Clousseau's wooing of Catherine Schell's Claudine with his chat up lines that are oddly reminiscent of the style of Humphrey Bogart. The slapstick is bumbling and always delivered, with the best scenes being Lytton's escape from the thugs, Clousseau's distraction during the bank robbery, Clousseau posing as a telephone repair man and especially the scene with the runaway vacuum cleaner. The characters are wonderfully crazy, and the acting is very good, as good as Catherine Schell, Herbert Lom(with his mental breakdown another highlight) and Christopher Plummer are, it is Peter Sellars who steals the show, his Clousseau as always is a riot. Overall, a great comedy and film. If there was anything that wasn't as good with the film, it was perhaps the length, the film could've done with being 5-10 minutes shorter. But it is a genuinely funny and well performed film and for me one of the better entries of the series. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    Picking up the role of Inspector Clouseau over a decade after A Shot in the Dark, Peter Sellers in this movie makes you wish he hadn't done something else for all that time. Though terribly plotted, The Return of the Pink Panther is filled with enough genuine hilarity that you won't really mind. The story is almost too simple. The legendary Pink Panther diamond is stolen from its home in the Middle Eastern country of Lugash, with evidence left behind implicating the almost-as-legendary jewel thief "The Phantom". The man who retrieved the diamond the first time it was stolen by The Phantom, Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers), is called into action, much to the chagrin of his dementedly frustrated boss, Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom). But it turns out that Sir Charles Litton (Christopher Plummer), the man who was The Phantom before retiring to please his young wife Claudine (Catherine Schell), is not responsible for the theft. Litton decides to head to Lugash to get to the bottom of the mystery while Clouseau is left to follow the Lady Litton to Switzerland as part of his own investigation. These Pink Panther movies are easy to review. Peter Sellers gives one of the greatest slapstick performances in cinema history as Clouseau, but there's not much else here. This one is essentially split in two, with Christopher Plummer doing a fairly good impersonation of Roger Moore, if James Bond were an international jewel thief, and Sellers just left to his own devices as Catherine Schell does little more than laugh at Clouseau's antics. Things are spiced up a bit with Herbert Lom's twitchy portrayal of Dreyfus' decent into madness over the colossal incompetence of his subordinate. I haven't the slightest idea why Blake Edwards thought anyone cared about Sir Charles Litton as much as Clouseau and while Edwards has his virtues as a storyteller, a sharp sense of pacing isn't one of them. This movie has a bloated and slack feel to it. Sellers is also noticeably less spry in the mid 70s than he was in the mid 60s. None of it matters all that much, because The Return of the Pink Panther has more than enough laughs, particularly Clouseau's battles with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk) and an epic struggle of Man vs. Lamp. This is a funny, family-friendly movie you should definitely watch with your kids when they're little.

    Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards reunite in this riotous comedy that is by far one of the better Pink Panther films. Sellers is on top form as Clouseau and nails every joke that Edwards sets up for them. A lot has been said about the relationship between the great actor and director but this film is a testament to how good they were together when on form. As always Herbert Lom is fantastic as Dreyfus and Burt Kwonk makes the martial art scenes a scream. Overall a fantastic entry to one of the best film comedy series of all time.

    Where Blake Edwards was once a handler of comedies combining slapstick, sophisticated wit, melancholia and social criticism, which was nearly forgotten by the time he's sold out this far into the eponymous franchise, because this one is just slapstick. Nothing else. He's mostly celebrated as the creator of the Pink Panther series. But this one's problem is how it drags. There isn't any anticipation felt or even created, any comic anguish, that nearly Hitchcockian suspense where time suddenly dilates to allow a burst of laughter. Other than the usual homage to the silent cinema of Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Leo McCarey, the Clouseau films seem to reveal preoccupations that come up again and again in Edwards' work. Clouseau is very much a hysterical white male and much of the series' humor comes from the ludicrous gap between his presumptions of cultural superiority and his idiotic behavior. He feels free to treat his Asian manservant Cato brutally, and proclaims his mastery over women, yet he is spectacularly inept at everything he attempts and is constantly humiliated. Clouseau's humiliations are particularly evident in a subtext of the films involving his predominant sexual embarrassment and failure. An elaborately original cartoon throughout the opening credits gets this amusingly distracting movie off to a lighthearted start before the bungling Inspector is asked by an Arab government to help them trace the Pink Panther diamond, which has been stolen from their theoretically impenetrable national museum. Clouseau deems the burglary to be the graft of Sir Charles Litton, a.k.a. The Phantom. To facilitate his own protection, the cunning Litton embarks on his own to recover the offender while his wife Claudine deflects Clouseau. The action is not so much a slapstick aficionado's ice cream castle as a slapstick aficionado's house of Cheetos. Our inelegant star is disengaged by defective vehicles, a telephone, a doorbell, revolving doors, a vacuum cleaner, a lamp, a parrot, and the exceedingly fanatical Cado who is provided with secret hiding places and surprise Kung Fu assaults. The sight gags come on like lightning and frantically, but the story line flies in several directions at once, where the original Pink Panther and A Shot in the Dark were methodically clever caper plots constructed out of their slapstick scenarios. Return of the Pink Panther is constructed right in synch with the brain's most rudimentary wavelengths, which is perhaps why it's a good house of Cheetos, a vegging-out flick.

    Peter Sellers returns as Inspector Clouseau after an 11 year absence, in this amusing sequel which finds the Pink Panther diamond being stolen again, and Clouseau is convinced that suspected jewel thief the Phantom is behind it, which means Sir Charles Litton(Christopher Plummer taking over from David Niven) is the prime suspect, along with his beautiful wife(played by Catherine Schell, though oddly, despite the end of the original film, doesn't seem to be Clouseau's ex-wife?) Herbert Lom again plays Dreyfeuss, and is portrayed as being on the verge of insanity. Burt Kwouk plays Cato, still trying to combat his employer Clouseau! Funny film has lots of inspired scenes, as Clouseau's disguises start to become elaborate. Leads directly into "...Strikes Again!"

    The third installment in the series begins when Inspector Clouseau is put on the case when the Pink Panther diamond is stolen, with the Phantom's trademark glove the only clue. Eleven years after the comedic masterpiece A Shot In The Dark, Peter Sellers returns as the bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau in another hysterical series of misadventures, that is known as, The Return Of The Pink Panther. In this movie, The Pink Panther returns...and so do the laughs! The third installment of the comedy series is a hysterical laugh fest, and that's not joke, the movie has got a lot of laughs, and when I mean laughs, I mean big laughs! The scenes in which Clouseau and Cato get into their brawls are hysterical enough, the scenes where Dreyfus keeps shooting himself are laugh filled too, and not to mention the scene where Clouseau is vacuuming the room and disaster ensues! In short, disaster ensues all over the place, it is the quintessential Pink Panther comedy film starring Peter Sellers! All in all, this is another big one for Peter Sellers, and Blake Edwards too! As he was in the two previous films, Peter Sellers is hilarious as the clumsy and bumbling but lovable Inspector Clouseau, who is trying to find The Pink Panther, and runs into mishaps at just about every turn! Christopher Plummer replaces David Niven as Sir Charles Litton, The Phantom. While Plummer was great, he in my opinion was a little too young for the role. Don't get me wrong, Plummer was great, but Niven was better. And of course, the late Herbert Lom delivers a wonderful performance as Clouseau's superior, Charles Dreyfus. By this time, Dreyfus is trying to get rid of Clouseau. And when I saw that, I don't mean firing him, I mean he wants to KILL him! In short, everybody in this movie is wonderful, with Sellers and Lom standing out the most. And as usual, the writing and directing from Blake Edwards is superb too. Blake Edwards was a comedic genius, and so was Peter Sellers, and when they worked together on this movie, they created another comedic masterpiece! All in all, The Return Of The Pink Panther is another great installment in the franchise, and it is another comedy gem brought to you by Blake Edwards (may he rest in peace). The series was great up until after Revenge Of The Pink Panther. After that, the series was finished, because Peter Sellers had died from a sudden heart attack. There is just no replacing Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau, there is only one Inspector Clouseau, and that is Peter Sellers. Even Blake Edwards said that it was a mistake to go on without Sellers. But anyway, this movie is hysterical, if you loved The Pink Panther and A Shot In The Dark, then what are you waiting for, you've got to see this hysterical third installment, as it will have you laughing yourself silly! You'll split your sides as you watch Inspector Clouseau get himself into a whole lot of trouble and mishaps, and you'll laugh even more when you see him trying to get out of them! 10/10

    Here is more like it, a true comedy with a screenplay that doesn't look ludicrous like that of A Shot In The Dark, and a plot that is so solid that makes you linger till the end to see what the outcome will be. Written, directed and produced by Blake Edwards this 1975 film in The Pink Panther series is breath taking funny and stands as one I will always remember. Inspector Clouseau fake exaggerated French accent is more pronounced in this movie, The Return of the Pink Panther than the previous and Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus mishaps were funnier than expected, that i found myself looking forward to his next unfortunate mishap. The chief instrument of his (other than the existence of Clouseasu) was his inability to tell which he was holding a gun or a lighter. The film stars Peter Sellers who reprises his role as Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The Return of the Pink Panther also stars the 84th Academy Award (2012) winner for best supporting actor (who became the oldest actor to win the award at age 82) Christopher Plummer who replaced David Niven as Sir Charles Lytton (the notorious Phantom). In this flick the Pink Panther diamond is now back in focus as it gets stolen again, and the man who was part responsible for finding it when it got stolen the first time, was called back to help recover the stolen diamond. The movie plot is funny to the core, with screenplays that will make you hold your ribs from bursting free. The late Blake Edwards (died in 2010) is known primarily for his comedies and this movie shows us why. The plot began in the fictional country of Lugash, a mysterious thief breaks into the National Museum, avoiding all the security pitfalls that were set in place for any prospective thief and steals the Pink Panther diamond. The mysterious thief left behind a calling card, which was a white monogrammed glove with a gold-tinted "P" on it. Feeling outwitted by the thief who was able to get pass the elaborated security system, put in place to secure the diamond, the Shah of Lugash requests the assistance of Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) to help them as they try to recover their national treasure. Clouseau on the other hand had been demoted to a beat cop, to patrol the streets. This was done by his boss, Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who despises Clouseau with a passion and dreams daily of killing him. This movie I do recommend to comedy lovers and I will proudly say this movie is better than the remake done by Steve Martin and Jean Reno in both 2006 and 2008. www.lagsreviews.com

Clouseau is very much a hysterical white male and much of the series' humor comes from the ludicrous gap between his presumptions of cultural superiority and his idiotic behavior. He feels free to treat his Asian manservant Cato brutally, and proclaims his mastery over women, yet he is spectacularly inept at everything he attempts and is constantly humiliated. Clouseau's humiliations are particularly evident in a subtext of the films involving his predominant sexual embarrassment and failure. An elaborately original cartoon throughout the opening credits gets this amusingly distracting movie off to a lighthearted start before the bungling Inspector is asked by an Arab government to help them trace the Pink Panther diamond, which has been stolen from their theoretically impenetrable national museum. Clouseau deems the burglary to be the graft of Sir Charles Litton, a.k.a. The Phantom. To facilitate his own protection, the cunning Litton embarks on his own to recover the offender while his wife Claudine deflects Clouseau. The action is not so much a slapstick aficionado's ice cream castle as a slapstick aficionado's house of Cheetos. Our inelegant star is disengaged by defective vehicles, a telephone, a doorbell, revolving doors, a vacuum cleaner, a lamp, a parrot, and the exceedingly fanatical Cado who is provided with secret hiding places and surprise Kung Fu assaults. The sight gags come on like lightning and frantically, but the story line flies in several directions at once, where the original Pink Panther and A Shot in the Dark were methodically clever caper plots constructed out of their slapstick scenarios. Return of the Pink Panther is constructed right in synch with the brain's most rudimentary wavelengths, which is perhaps why it's a good house of Cheetos, a vegging-out flick.
