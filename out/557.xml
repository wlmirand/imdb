    Farinelli may not to me be perfect, the sex scenes do get too much and I didn't find the lip synching to be anywhere near convincing as you can tell that the singing was not coming out of the actor. There are plenty of positives though. I personally did find the drama engrossing, true it isn't faithful from a historical standpoint, then again I can't think of any biopic of a musician or composer that didn't take some kind of liberty with the truth, but Farinelli is an emotionally-charged film and there was plenty of that. That is also true of the writing, which flows well and didn't feel jarring. The film looks spectacular, the costumes and sets are gorgeous to look at and is shot and directed beautifully. I have no faults with the music either, it is so good that my appreciation for early music further grew. The singing is equally wonderful, the scene in the theatre with the long high note was unbelievable. Stefano Dionisi is magnetic in the title role, Enrico Lo Verso brings intensity to the role of the "less talented" brother, Marianne Cellier has a very expressive face and Jereon Knabbe gives one of his best ever performances positively relishing his role as Handel(even if you question whether Handel was really like that). All in all, a very good film, fascinating and a visual and musical feast. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    reconstruction of a period. eulogy to an artist. impressive picture. and new film with old ingredients. maybe, not accuracy is its virtue. or the performance who may be admirable. the story - in few extraordinary moments. the art of director - yes, it is OK. but more important is the flavor. the touch of things, the silk of gestures, the cotton of words, the feeling to be part of action and the final impression , after the lost of fairy-tale skin, to discover a parable. this is great director secret - an universal lesson about yourself. instrument - magnificent music and a remarkable cast. a large light circle. and a wonderful science of detail. An Italian word says - Si non e vero, e ben trovato ( even it is not true, it is conceived ). in this case, it is perfect definition.

    In the 18th century, long before modern music could be canned for mass consumption, there existed a life-style which could only be sculpted from the unfortunate lives of prepubescent boys of Europe. This movie called " Farinelli " is the finest example of what was once deemed a most unique form of Opera. The story is based on the true story of two brothers who's father fettered them to a life of music and composition. Stefano Dionisi plays Carlo Broschi, AKA as Farinelli and his brother Riccardo Broschi (Enrico Lo Verso). Together they travel far and wide seeking not only an Opera loving audience, but also a rich patron who could afford their talent. The time of our story is set during the Baroque heyday of Frideric Handel (Jeroen Krabbe) who's great Classical music became the epitome of royalty and high society alike. The elder Broschi believes he did the right thing by suffering his younger brother to the excruciating pain of being castrated. However, he is then haunted by the fact his tortured brother has nightmares from the incident. Travel as the two boys do throughout the film, the story becomes more a testament of conscience, than one dealing with the audience appreciation of the day. Still, for Opera lovers or for those who enjoy good operatic theater, this movie delivers a cornucopia of both, with great period costumes and superior acting. Indeed, Stefano Dionisi and Jeroen Krabb&eacute; are superb as their lives play against each another. ****

    This film is a very correct biography of Carlo Broschi, the most famous castrato-countertenor of the 18th century, and of all times. Not only is it told in a simple and romantisized way, so that everyone can relate to it, but it explains what made him stand out above all the other superstar-castrati of that time, either in Italy and anywhere else. The writers of the story, Ren&eacute;e and G&eacute;rard Corbiau, use historical figures to make this clear, much the same way the author of Amadeus did: In reality, Antonio Salieri did NOT kill nor try to nor thought he did kill Mozart; he wasn't jealous of him at all, nor did he despise his personality or thought he didn't deserve the great talent he had received from God. In fact, Salieri, much like everybody else in Europe, was quite besotted about Wolfgang. He wasn't considered stupid nor vulgar (well, okay, he was, a bit; but people found that very funny in the 18th century), nor lacking merit. The author of 'Amadeus' simply used Salieri in order to show us how enormous Mozart's genius was, in a way he couldn't have done by merely tell the story of his life. The latter has been done several times, as a matter of fact, without ever having had the huge impact the film Amadeus had. But by doing it this way, it did the real Antonio Salieri great injustice. He used him as a character, not as a historical figure. In quite the same manner, the Corbiaus used George Friedrich Heandel and Ricardo Broschi, who in reality were both perfectly honorable and decent people and massively gifted composers; not to tell how great THEY were, but how great Farinelli was. Big brother Ricardo comes across, in this film, as a user, who profits from his exploited little brother both romantically, financially and musically, by first having him study music, having him castrated, writing mediocre music for him merely meant to demonstrate his extraordinary voice, much like a trained monkey. Ricardo, in this film, represents the popular music industry, which still exists today and is much the same: more interested in money and other gain than in beauty, art and perfection. This Ricardo has nothing in common with the real Ricardo Broschi, who took great care of his little brother after the untimely demise of their parents, was a mother and a father to him, hesitated painfully to give his permission for the castration (which was never performed unless at the distinct and repeated plead of the young singer himself), and finally wrote beautiful music. The Heandel-character on the other hand, represents an other group of people: the musical snobs, who DO know about beauty and perfection, but who let themselves be blinded by despising prejudice towards popular artists, whom the simple people worship. Those who think: if it's commercially successful, it can't possibly be anything but bad! The Heandel in "Farinelli", although formidably interpreted by Jeroen Krabb&eacute;, couldn't be further away from the real Heandel, who loved and respected his interpretors, who (like everybody else) was in awe before the dazzling talent of Carlo Broschi. Farinelli most probably would have become a great opera singer even without having been castrated: he would have been a tenor, maybe, or a countertenor, even a baritone, who will know? But in any case his love and comprehension of music and beauty, his soul was so great, he would have been a god of song anyways. No, in the story, poor Heandel is badly abused; this is however not the real Heandel. That one, the real one, is in the divine music filling this film to the rim. That's where the real Heandel and the real Ricardo Broschi are given the honor they deserve. 'Farinelli' tells how a gifted, but shallow pop star slowly evolves into a fantastic virtuoso, who forces the respect of everyone, and leaves all mediocrity behind. The performances are extraordinary. I think Carlo Broschi would have been pleased with this film about his life. It's not just a long ode to his greatness: it's a tale of the struggle a little boy has to go through to reach the top of his capabilities, accepting every suffering, every humiliation, every sacrifice it takes to get there.

    This was a fascinating story. I find myself very drawn to the kinky drama of the castrato singer -- and longing to hear what his voice really sounded like. I've been listening to recordings of Mozart's "Queen of the Night" aria recorded by women and boys nowadays and frustrated that everyone who sings it sounds strained and harsh -- wondering what Farinelli, the greatest singer in opera history, would have sounded like singing it. Unfortunately, I don't think the voice or the body in this movie were accurate. A castrato singer would have the lightness of a boy's voice. Sometimes the synthesized voice in this movie captured that, but generally it was too heavy. I sort of imagine a castrato soprano sounding more like Michael Jackson in "Little Susie," only probably higher. Also, this actor had a prominent Adam's apple, heavy bony structure around the eyes and jaw, and rippling muscles all over his body. A castrato, a person who had lacked testosterone since childhood, would lack all these things. He would have an angelic face, with childlike eyes -- more like the boy actor used for Farinelli before castration. The castrato would also have few visible muscles -- and certainly no visible Adam's apple. He might have enjoyed sex, but would have been unlikely to be so aggressive as this character was. Also, the idea that castrati could not achieve climax, as indicated in this movie was likely wrong. Moreover, not having gone through puberty, the castrato would likely have had a more gentle, childlike personality than this character, also endearing him to women. Women reportedly fainted when listening to the castrati sing. No one would have really fainted for the character in this movie. He just did not have the kind of eyes or the kind of voice to make a woman faint. It's as if the people who did the movie just were clueless. At the high point of the castrati, they were castrating 4,000 boys a year in Italy, supposedly. Presumably they were drawn to all that barbarism because the voices were really extraordinary, not merely high but of a quality to be drug-like in their beauty. I hope someone will try again -- and do better on the casting and synthesized singing this time. I want to be drawn into the vocal experience that was so amazing that they would castrate little boys to achieve it.

    The sets and costumes are magnificent and give a 21st century viewer a glimpse of what life must have been like for the fortunate wealthy in the days of the baroque composers, but the story is confusing and there was far too much gratuitous sex. It was as if the filmmakers did not think that the beautiful music and sumptuous settings could carry the film. I don't know if something was lost in the subtitling, or whether too much film was left on he cutting room floor, but I was baffled by a number of the characters. Who was Benjamin and why did he wear a body brace? Who were Alexandra and Margareth? The characters simply seemed to be a device to move the story along to the bizarre and unnecessary sex scenes. My biggest problem was with the poor lip synching, which was so obvious that it distracted and spoiled the flow of the film. It was not just that the facial mannerisms did not match the voice, but that the volume actually dropped to the extent that the voice seemed to be coming from off stage. Nowhere was this worse than the trumpet scene at the beginning. The castrati had very powerful voices, but Farinelli's voice sounds like a far-off squeak. Synching has been done very successfully in the past, most notably by Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady and Ava Gardner is Show Boat, and most famously by Edmund Purdom in the Student Prince, so it should not be beyond the capability of film makers 40 or more years later. I felt that the film would have been more convincing if Farinelli had been played by a soprano doing her own singing, and had concentrated more on the relationship with the brother who was riding on Farinelli's coat tails. How often have we seen a partnership where one half is nothing without the other, and knows it. As for the comparison with the decadent rock star life style, that is how the castrati stars allegedly lived in the hedonistic 18th-century. I am not sure either that the castrati strutted around the stage like drag queens as they were supposed to be playing the women's parts as women. Given Ken Russell’s record of appallingly bad taste portrayals of musicians, it is surprising that he never attempted this one. It was right up his street. Opera lovers would be better served by listening to recordings of Handels operas.

    This movie has something of a kinship with "Amadeus," portraying as it does the important cultural significance of music in a very different time and place - far more significant than music is today - but it's a much darker movie than "Amadeus" (which itself has some dark undertones.) The movie gives a glimpse into the life of Carlo Roschi (better known as Farinelli) - one of the great opera singers of the 18th century. Farinelli (played by Stefano Dionisi) was a castrato - castrated as a young boy in order to preserve his brilliant soprano voice. Admittedly, it's a bit off putting to see a male portrayed as singing soprano (I say portrayed, because I assume Dionisi was lip-synching, since we don't have castratos today.) But while Farinelli's singing was the centerpiece of the movie, what's really being portrayed here (and, from what I've been able to glean, not entirely accurately, although I'm no expert on 18th century opera singers!) are the complex relationships in Farinelli's life - especially his relationship with his brother Riccardo (Enrico Lo Verso.) Carlo was the brilliant singer; Riccardo seems to have been a rather average composer - but, trying to keep a promise made to their father, they work as a team. The relationship is bizarre, and sometimes even vaguely erotic. Riccardo describes a love between them more passionate than that between lovers - and perhaps because of that passion there are huge amounts of jealousy and anger as well as love. The two brothers share everything - including women, in what are portrayed as strange tag-team sorts of sexual encounters, where - to put it bluntly - Riccardo finishes what Carlo can only start. There's also an interesting exploration of Farinelli's relationship with the great composer Handel (Jeroen Krabbe), which revolves around their work for rival opera houses in London. It's really very interesting. The movie is mostly in Italian and French, which necessitates subtitles for English speakers, which I always find a bit distracting. I was also disappointed that the movie depicts virtually nothing of Farinelli's time in the Spanish court, where Farinelli became court musician to King Philip V - and apparently very influential, as well. Still, it's very well done, and you don't have to be a fan of opera to enjoy this. 8/10

    Be prepared for something different, disturbing, and with a history lesson that is completely inaccurate. In fact, it is a blatantly convoluted tale that looks more like a Cinderella story than actual accounts of history. Director Gerard Corbiau's Farinelli is 'all that' but it also is visually stunning and represents castrati singing with richness and clarity. Farinelli is the artistic name of castrato (a male castrated at a young age) Carlo Broschi (Stefano Dionisi), a handsome young choir boy who was accidentally castrated at the age of 10 purportedly due to a riding accident. Ill and under the influence of powerful drugs (opium) at the time, Carlo has no recollection of his unfortunate accident. His brother Riccardo (Enrico Lo Verso), seven years his senior, tells him repeatedly the story of how he was riding a beautiful white horse from which he was thrown, causing an injury that led to his castration. Throughout his life, Carlo has a recurring nightmare about riding the white horse but in his dream he never falls off. The conflict between Carlo's dreams and Riccardo's stories hints at the horrible secret between the brothers that is ultimately revealed near the end of the film. Carlo's astonishing soprano voice (a digitized composition of the voices of Derek Lee Ragin and Ewa Mallas Godlewska) eventually makes him and his brother who composes mediocre operatic scores for Carlo to perform, a phenomenal success. Carlo relinquishes his born name with his professional name Farinelli. Although Carlo suspects that his brother had something to do with his childhood emasculation, he continues to perform his brothers badly written operas. Both brothers are aware that Carlo's superior talent is being undermined by performing Riccardo's operas. An ill-fated meeting with Maestro George Frederick Handel (Jeroen Krabb&eacute;), who desired a contract with Carlo, begins a contentious battle between the two for the lion's share of audience. Carlo turns down Maestro Handel's offer is hired to perform in a London theater to draw audiences away from Handel's operas. Farinelli performs wonderfully and eventually takes virtually all of the audience away from Handel. Carlo's looks, fantastic voice, and range make female audience members faint dead away. One woman tells Carlo that he is responsible for her first musical orgasm! A pact between brothers where women are concerned creates titillating m&eacute;nage a trios scenes which earned the film its R rating. Carlo soon realizes that performing Handel's operas are so desirable to him that he tries to convince Handel to take him in. The rest of the story reveals the tragic secret that Carlo has always known but in the end brings brothers together for one more m&eacute;nage a trios that would leave Carlo to become a father; the one gift that was taken away from him as a child. I really enjoyed this film and the music that accompanied it. I commend the director for his efforts to take a difficult subject matter and turn it into a story that is both entertaining and titillating at times. However, the early-on innuendo that Riccardo was somehow responsible for Carlo's difficult life took away the endings potential climax that could have left the audience hanging. --Lewis Saettel 2007

    How could I dislike most opera, and LIKE this film? The sets, costumes, and period attitudes were amazing. The Castrato voice was amazing. Do I wish I'd lived in that world? NO! But... the "Castrati" singers were a serious cultural phenomenon, and an odd, interesting, self centered, sad, twisted human "invention" that leave you wondering if there's another species you'd rather join. This is a true story, which adds credibility to its bizarreness. It's about the rise a Europe's most popular  dare I say "Superstar"? - Castrato, "Farinelli", who became all the rage. He was wined, dined, and sexed by anyone who could get near him, and yet, like so many superstars, life was not what it seemed. His relationship to Handel is an interesting one, but not equal to that with his brother. The story unfolds exactly like one of the operas  with all the drama and flourishes one would expect from that time. When you're in the mood to enter a VERY different world that existed on THIS planet, "Farinelli" should be on that list.

    This movie has made a bigger impact on me than any other movie, music, book, you name it,- has ever had! It was shown to me by my teacher in culture history in a lecture a few years ago. Before showing this movie, he talked a little bit about what "castrati" means and is about, which I think everybody should know before seeing it so I highly recommend to read about it before watching this movie, to achieve best understanding. I only saw 20 minutes of the film because after 20 minutes of seeing it, my vision had gotten intensively impaired and was getting worse by the second! Then my throat started to close up, similar to asthmatic attacks which I do not have, and other students in the classroom noticed my odd behavior and before I knew it, all eyes were on me... I managed to stand up only to recklessly wander out in the hall, bouncing back and forth on the walls! Within seconds I lost consciousness and fell to the ground! I hadn't ever lost consciousness before so the feelings just before loosing consciousness was new to my mind and normally, I would be terrified and panicking but I was calm as a flower in windless weather! All I thought about, whilst freaking out other kids in the halls as if I was a drunk rapist, was this movie! The power of it! The beauty of it! The seductive tantalization of it! The school nurses and an educated doctor, couldn't find any cause why this would happen since I'm a healthy eating/living guy! But I knew all along, the hours on the hospital was in vain because it wasn't physical... It was...Farinelli...

The Heandel-character on the other hand, represents an other group of people: the musical snobs, who DO know about beauty and perfection, but who let themselves be blinded by despising prejudice towards popular artists, whom the simple people worship. Those who think: if it's commercially successful, it can't possibly be anything but bad! The Heandel in "Farinelli", although formidably interpreted by Jeroen Krabb&eacute;, couldn't be further away from the real Heandel, who loved and respected his interpretors, who (like everybody else) was in awe before the dazzling talent of Carlo Broschi. Farinelli most probably would have become a great opera singer even without having been castrated: he would have been a tenor, maybe, or a countertenor, even a baritone, who will know? But in any case his love and comprehension of music and beauty, his soul was so great, he would have been a god of song anyways. No, in the story, poor Heandel is badly abused; this is however not the real Heandel. That one, the real one, is in the divine music filling this film to the rim. That's where the real Heandel and the real Ricardo Broschi are given the honor they deserve. 'Farinelli' tells how a gifted, but shallow pop star slowly evolves into a fantastic virtuoso, who forces the respect of everyone, and leaves all mediocrity behind. The performances are extraordinary. I think Carlo Broschi would have been pleased with this film about his life. It's not just a long ode to his greatness: it's a tale of the struggle a little boy has to go through to reach the top of his capabilities, accepting every suffering, every humiliation, every sacrifice it takes to get there.

    This was a fascinating story. I find myself very drawn to the kinky drama of the castrato singer -- and longing to hear what his voice really sounded like. I've been listening to recordings of Mozart's "Queen of the Night" aria recorded by women and boys nowadays and frustrated that everyone who sings it sounds strained and harsh -- wondering what Farinelli, the greatest singer in opera history, would have sounded like singing it. Unfortunately, I don't think the voice or the body in this movie were accurate. A castrato singer would have the lightness of a boy's voice. Sometimes the synthesized voice in this movie captured that, but generally it was too heavy. I sort of imagine a castrato soprano sounding more like Michael Jackson in "Little Susie," only probably higher. Also, this actor had a prominent Adam's apple, heavy bony structure around the eyes and jaw, and rippling muscles all over his body. A castrato, a person who had lacked testosterone since childhood, would lack all these things. He would have an angelic face, with childlike eyes -- more like the boy actor used for Farinelli before castration. The castrato would also have few visible muscles -- and certainly no visible Adam's apple. He might have enjoyed sex, but would have been unlikely to be so aggressive as this character was. Also, the idea that castrati could not achieve climax, as indicated in this movie was likely wrong. Moreover, not having gone through puberty, the castrato would likely have had a more gentle, childlike personality than this character, also endearing him to women. Women reportedly fainted when listening to the castrati sing. No one would have really fainted for the character in this movie. He just did not have the kind of eyes or the kind of voice to make a woman faint. It's as if the people who did the movie just were clueless. At the high point of the castrati, they were castrating 4,000 boys a year in Italy, supposedly. Presumably they were drawn to all that barbarism because the voices were really extraordinary, not merely high but of a quality to be drug-like in their beauty. I hope someone will try again -- and do better on the casting and synthesized singing this time. I want to be drawn into the vocal experience that was so amazing that they would castrate little boys to achieve it.

    The sets and costumes are magnificent and give a 21st century viewer a glimpse of what life must have been like for the fortunate wealthy in the days of the baroque composers, but the story is confusing and there was far too much gratuitous sex. It was as if the filmmakers did not think that the beautiful music and sumptuous settings could carry the film. I don't know if something was lost in the subtitling, or whether too much film was left on he cutting room floor, but I was baffled by a number of the characters. Who was Benjamin and why did he wear a body brace? Who were Alexandra and Margareth? The characters simply seemed to be a device to move the story along to the bizarre and unnecessary sex scenes. My biggest problem was with the poor lip synching, which was so obvious that it distracted and spoiled the flow of the film. It was not just that the facial mannerisms did not match the voice, but that the volume actually dropped to the extent that the voice seemed to be coming from off stage. Nowhere was this worse than the trumpet scene at the beginning. The castrati had very powerful voices, but Farinelli's voice sounds like a far-off squeak. Synching has been done very successfully in the past, most notably by Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady and Ava Gardner is Show Boat, and most famously by Edmund Purdom in the Student Prince, so it should not be beyond the capability of film makers 40 or more years later. I felt that the film would have been more convincing if Farinelli had been played by a soprano doing her own singing, and had concentrated more on the relationship with the brother who was riding on Farinelli's coat tails. How often have we seen a partnership where one half is nothing without the other, and knows it. As for the comparison with the decadent rock star life style, that is how the castrati stars allegedly lived in the hedonistic 18th-century. I am not sure either that the castrati strutted around the stage like drag queens as they were supposed to be playing the women's parts as women. Given Ken Russell’s record of appallingly bad taste portrayals of musicians, it is surprising that he never attempted this one. It was right up his street. Opera lovers would be better served by listening to recordings of Handels operas.

    This movie has something of a kinship with "Amadeus," portraying as it does the important cultural significance of music in a very different time and place - far more significant than music is today - but it's a much darker movie than "Amadeus" (which itself has some dark undertones.) The movie gives a glimpse into the life of Carlo Roschi (better known as Farinelli) - one of the great opera singers of the 18th century. Farinelli (played by Stefano Dionisi) was a castrato - castrated as a young boy in order to preserve his brilliant soprano voice. Admittedly, it's a bit off putting to see a male portrayed as singing soprano (I say portrayed, because I assume Dionisi was lip-synching, since we don't have castratos today.) But while Farinelli's singing was the centerpiece of the movie, what's really being portrayed here (and, from what I've been able to glean, not entirely accurately, although I'm no expert on 18th century opera singers!) are the complex relationships in Farinelli's life - especially his relationship with his brother Riccardo (Enrico Lo Verso.) Carlo was the brilliant singer; Riccardo seems to have been a rather average composer - but, trying to keep a promise made to their father, they work as a team. The relationship is bizarre, and sometimes even vaguely erotic. Riccardo describes a love between them more passionate than that between lovers - and perhaps because of that passion there are huge amounts of jealousy and anger as well as love. The two brothers share everything - including women, in what are portrayed as strange tag-team sorts of sexual encounters, where - to put it bluntly - Riccardo finishes what Carlo can only start. There's also an interesting exploration of Farinelli's relationship with the great composer Handel (Jeroen Krabbe), which revolves around their work for rival opera houses in London. It's really very interesting. The movie is mostly in Italian and French, which necessitates subtitles for English speakers, which I always find a bit distracting. I was also disappointed that the movie depicts virtually nothing of Farinelli's time in the Spanish court, where Farinelli became court musician to King Philip V - and apparently very influential, as well. Still, it's very well done, and you don't have to be a fan of opera to enjoy this. 8/10

    Be prepared for something different, disturbing, and with a history lesson that is completely inaccurate. In fact, it is a blatantly convoluted tale that looks more like a Cinderella story than actual accounts of history. Director Gerard Corbiau's Farinelli is 'all that' but it also is visually stunning and represents castrati singing with richness and clarity. Farinelli is the artistic name of castrato (a male castrated at a young age) Carlo Broschi (Stefano Dionisi), a handsome young choir boy who was accidentally castrated at the age of 10 purportedly due to a riding accident. Ill and under the influence of powerful drugs (opium) at the time, Carlo has no recollection of his unfortunate accident. His brother Riccardo (Enrico Lo Verso), seven years his senior, tells him repeatedly the story of how he was riding a beautiful white horse from which he was thrown, causing an injury that led to his castration. Throughout his life, Carlo has a recurring nightmare about riding the white horse but in his dream he never falls off. The conflict between Carlo's dreams and Riccardo's stories hints at the horrible secret between the brothers that is ultimately revealed near the end of the film. Carlo's astonishing soprano voice (a digitized composition of the voices of Derek Lee Ragin and Ewa Mallas Godlewska) eventually makes him and his brother who composes mediocre operatic scores for Carlo to perform, a phenomenal success. Carlo relinquishes his born name with his professional name Farinelli. Although Carlo suspects that his brother had something to do with his childhood emasculation, he continues to perform his brothers badly written operas. Both brothers are aware that Carlo's superior talent is being undermined by performing Riccardo's operas. An ill-fated meeting with Maestro George Frederick Handel (Jeroen Krabb&eacute;), who desired a contract with Carlo, begins a contentious battle between the two for the lion's share of audience. Carlo turns down Maestro Handel's offer is hired to perform in a London theater to draw audiences away from Handel's operas. Farinelli performs wonderfully and eventually takes virtually all of the audience away from Handel. Carlo's looks, fantastic voice, and range make female audience members faint dead away. One woman tells Carlo that he is responsible for her first musical orgasm! A pact between brothers where women are concerned creates titillating m&eacute;nage a trios scenes which earned the film its R rating. Carlo soon realizes that performing Handel's operas are so desirable to him that he tries to convince Handel to take him in. The rest of the story reveals the tragic secret that Carlo has always known but in the end brings brothers together for one more m&eacute;nage a trios that would leave Carlo to become a father; the one gift that was taken away from him as a child. I really enjoyed this film and the music that accompanied it. I commend the director for his efforts to take a difficult subject matter and turn it into a story that is both entertaining and titillating at times. However, the early-on innuendo that Riccardo was somehow responsible for Carlo's difficult life took away the endings potential climax that could have left the audience hanging. --Lewis Saettel 2007

    How could I dislike most opera, and LIKE this film? The sets, costumes, and period attitudes were amazing. The Castrato voice was amazing. Do I wish I'd lived in that world? NO! But... the "Castrati" singers were a serious cultural phenomenon, and an odd, interesting, self centered, sad, twisted human "invention" that leave you wondering if there's another species you'd rather join. This is a true story, which adds credibility to its bizarreness. It's about the rise a Europe's most popular  dare I say "Superstar"? - Castrato, "Farinelli", who became all the rage. He was wined, dined, and sexed by anyone who could get near him, and yet, like so many superstars, life was not what it seemed. His relationship to Handel is an interesting one, but not equal to that with his brother. The story unfolds exactly like one of the operas  with all the drama and flourishes one would expect from that time. When you're in the mood to enter a VERY different world that existed on THIS planet, "Farinelli" should be on that list.

    This movie has made a bigger impact on me than any other movie, music, book, you name it,- has ever had! It was shown to me by my teacher in culture history in a lecture a few years ago. Before showing this movie, he talked a little bit about what "castrati" means and is about, which I think everybody should know before seeing it so I highly recommend to read about it before watching this movie, to achieve best understanding. I only saw 20 minutes of the film because after 20 minutes of seeing it, my vision had gotten intensively impaired and was getting worse by the second! Then my throat started to close up, similar to asthmatic attacks which I do not have, and other students in the classroom noticed my odd behavior and before I knew it, all eyes were on me... I managed to stand up only to recklessly wander out in the hall, bouncing back and forth on the walls! Within seconds I lost consciousness and fell to the ground! I hadn't ever lost consciousness before so the feelings just before loosing consciousness was new to my mind and normally, I would be terrified and panicking but I was calm as a flower in windless weather! All I thought about, whilst freaking out other kids in the halls as if I was a drunk rapist, was this movie! The power of it! The beauty of it! The seductive tantalization of it! The school nurses and an educated doctor, couldn't find any cause why this would happen since I'm a healthy eating/living guy! But I knew all along, the hours on the hospital was in vain because it wasn't physical... It was...Farinelli...

    Farinelli may not to me be perfect, the sex scenes do get too much and I didn't find the lip synching to be anywhere near convincing as you can tell that the singing was not coming out of the actor. There are plenty of positives though. I personally did find the drama engrossing, true it isn't faithful from a historical standpoint, then again I can't think of any biopic of a musician or composer that didn't take some kind of liberty with the truth, but Farinelli is an emotionally-charged film and there was plenty of that. That is also true of the writing, which flows well and didn't feel jarring. The film looks spectacular, the costumes and sets are gorgeous to look at and is shot and directed beautifully. I have no faults with the music either, it is so good that my appreciation for early music further grew. The singing is equally wonderful, the scene in the theatre with the long high note was unbelievable. Stefano Dionisi is magnetic in the title role, Enrico Lo Verso brings intensity to the role of the "less talented" brother, Marianne Cellier has a very expressive face and Jereon Knabbe gives one of his best ever performances positively relishing his role as Handel(even if you question whether Handel was really like that). All in all, a very good film, fascinating and a visual and musical feast. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    reconstruction of a period. eulogy to an artist. impressive picture. and new film with old ingredients. maybe, not accuracy is its virtue. or the performance who may be admirable. the story - in few extraordinary moments. the art of director - yes, it is OK. but more important is the flavor. the touch of things, the silk of gestures, the cotton of words, the feeling to be part of action and the final impression , after the lost of fairy-tale skin, to discover a parable. this is great director secret - an universal lesson about yourself. instrument - magnificent music and a remarkable cast. a large light circle. and a wonderful science of detail. An Italian word says - Si non e vero, e ben trovato ( even it is not true, it is conceived ). in this case, it is perfect definition.

    In the 18th century, long before modern music could be canned for mass consumption, there existed a life-style which could only be sculpted from the unfortunate lives of prepubescent boys of Europe. This movie called " Farinelli " is the finest example of what was once deemed a most unique form of Opera. The story is based on the true story of two brothers who's father fettered them to a life of music and composition. Stefano Dionisi plays Carlo Broschi, AKA as Farinelli and his brother Riccardo Broschi (Enrico Lo Verso). Together they travel far and wide seeking not only an Opera loving audience, but also a rich patron who could afford their talent. The time of our story is set during the Baroque heyday of Frideric Handel (Jeroen Krabbe) who's great Classical music became the epitome of royalty and high society alike. The elder Broschi believes he did the right thing by suffering his younger brother to the excruciating pain of being castrated. However, he is then haunted by the fact his tortured brother has nightmares from the incident. Travel as the two boys do throughout the film, the story becomes more a testament of conscience, than one dealing with the audience appreciation of the day. Still, for Opera lovers or for those who enjoy good operatic theater, this movie delivers a cornucopia of both, with great period costumes and superior acting. Indeed, Stefano Dionisi and Jeroen Krabb&eacute; are superb as their lives play against each another. ****

    This film is a very correct biography of Carlo Broschi, the most famous castrato-countertenor of the 18th century, and of all times. Not only is it told in a simple and romantisized way, so that everyone can relate to it, but it explains what made him stand out above all the other superstar-castrati of that time, either in Italy and anywhere else. The writers of the story, Ren&eacute;e and G&eacute;rard Corbiau, use historical figures to make this clear, much the same way the author of Amadeus did: In reality, Antonio Salieri did NOT kill nor try to nor thought he did kill Mozart; he wasn't jealous of him at all, nor did he despise his personality or thought he didn't deserve the great talent he had received from God. In fact, Salieri, much like everybody else in Europe, was quite besotted about Wolfgang. He wasn't considered stupid nor vulgar (well, okay, he was, a bit; but people found that very funny in the 18th century), nor lacking merit. The author of 'Amadeus' simply used Salieri in order to show us how enormous Mozart's genius was, in a way he couldn't have done by merely tell the story of his life. The latter has been done several times, as a matter of fact, without ever having had the huge impact the film Amadeus had. But by doing it this way, it did the real Antonio Salieri great injustice. He used him as a character, not as a historical figure. In quite the same manner, the Corbiaus used George Friedrich Heandel and Ricardo Broschi, who in reality were both perfectly honorable and decent people and massively gifted composers; not to tell how great THEY were, but how great Farinelli was. Big brother Ricardo comes across, in this film, as a user, who profits from his exploited little brother both romantically, financially and musically, by first having him study music, having him castrated, writing mediocre music for him merely meant to demonstrate his extraordinary voice, much like a trained monkey. Ricardo, in this film, represents the popular music industry, which still exists today and is much the same: more interested in money and other gain than in beauty, art and perfection. This Ricardo has nothing in common with the real Ricardo Broschi, who took great care of his little brother after the untimely demise of their parents, was a mother and a father to him, hesitated painfully to give his permission for the castration (which was never performed unless at the distinct and repeated plead of the young singer himself), and finally wrote beautiful music. The Heandel-character on the other hand, represents an other group of people: the musical snobs, who DO know about beauty and perfection, but who let themselves be blinded by despising prejudice towards popular artists, whom the simple people worship. Those who think: if it's commercially successful, it can't possibly be anything but bad! The Heandel in "Farinelli", although formidably interpreted by Jeroen Krabb&eacute;, couldn't be further away from the real Heandel, who loved and respected his interpretors, who (like everybody else) was in awe before the dazzling talent of Carlo Broschi. Farinelli most probably would have become a great opera singer even without having been castrated: he would have been a tenor, maybe, or a countertenor, even a baritone, who will know? But in any case his love and comprehension of music and beauty, his soul was so great, he would have been a god of song anyways. No, in the story, poor Heandel is badly abused; this is however not the real Heandel. That one, the real one, is in the divine music filling this film to the rim. That's where the real Heandel and the real Ricardo Broschi are given the honor they deserve. 'Farinelli' tells how a gifted, but shallow pop star slowly evolves into a fantastic virtuoso, who forces the respect of everyone, and leaves all mediocrity behind. The performances are extraordinary. I think Carlo Broschi would have been pleased with this film about his life. It's not just a long ode to his greatness: it's a tale of the struggle a little boy has to go through to reach the top of his capabilities, accepting every suffering, every humiliation, every sacrifice it takes to get there.

    Be prepared for something different, disturbing, and with a history lesson that is completely inaccurate. In fact, it is a blatantly convoluted tale that looks more like a Cinderella story than actual accounts of history. Director Gerard Corbiau's Farinelli is 'all that' but it also is visually stunning and represents castrati singing with richness and clarity. Farinelli is the artistic name of castrato (a male castrated at a young age) Carlo Broschi (Stefano Dionisi), a handsome young choir boy who was accidentally castrated at the age of 10 purportedly due to a riding accident. Ill and under the influence of powerful drugs (opium) at the time, Carlo has no recollection of his unfortunate accident. His brother Riccardo (Enrico Lo Verso), seven years his senior, tells him repeatedly the story of how he was riding a beautiful white horse from which he was thrown, causing an injury that led to his castration. Throughout his life, Carlo has a recurring nightmare about riding the white horse but in his dream he never falls off. The conflict between Carlo's dreams and Riccardo's stories hints at the horrible secret between the brothers that is ultimately revealed near the end of the film. Carlo's astonishing soprano voice (a digitized composition of the voices of Derek Lee Ragin and Ewa Mallas Godlewska) eventually makes him and his brother who composes mediocre operatic scores for Carlo to perform, a phenomenal success. Carlo relinquishes his born name with his professional name Farinelli. Although Carlo suspects that his brother had something to do with his childhood emasculation, he continues to perform his brothers badly written operas. Both brothers are aware that Carlo's superior talent is being undermined by performing Riccardo's operas. An ill-fated meeting with Maestro George Frederick Handel (Jeroen Krabb&eacute;), who desired a contract with Carlo, begins a contentious battle between the two for the lion's share of audience. Carlo turns down Maestro Handel's offer is hired to perform in a London theater to draw audiences away from Handel's operas. Farinelli performs wonderfully and eventually takes virtually all of the audience away from Handel. Carlo's looks, fantastic voice, and range make female audience members faint dead away. One woman tells Carlo that he is responsible for her first musical orgasm! A pact between brothers where women are concerned creates titillating m&eacute;nage a trios scenes which earned the film its R rating. Carlo soon realizes that performing Handel's operas are so desirable to him that he tries to convince Handel to take him in. The rest of the story reveals the tragic secret that Carlo has always known but in the end brings brothers together for one more m&eacute;nage a trios that would leave Carlo to become a father; the one gift that was taken away from him as a child. I really enjoyed this film and the music that accompanied it. I commend the director for his efforts to take a difficult subject matter and turn it into a story that is both entertaining and titillating at times. However, the early-on innuendo that Riccardo was somehow responsible for Carlo's difficult life took away the endings potential climax that could have left the audience hanging. --Lewis Saettel 2007

    How could I dislike most opera, and LIKE this film? The sets, costumes, and period attitudes were amazing. The Castrato voice was amazing. Do I wish I'd lived in that world? NO! But... the "Castrati" singers were a serious cultural phenomenon, and an odd, interesting, self centered, sad, twisted human "invention" that leave you wondering if there's another species you'd rather join. This is a true story, which adds credibility to its bizarreness. It's about the rise a Europe's most popular  dare I say "Superstar"? - Castrato, "Farinelli", who became all the rage. He was wined, dined, and sexed by anyone who could get near him, and yet, like so many superstars, life was not what it seemed. His relationship to Handel is an interesting one, but not equal to that with his brother. The story unfolds exactly like one of the operas  with all the drama and flourishes one would expect from that time. When you're in the mood to enter a VERY different world that existed on THIS planet, "Farinelli" should be on that list.

    This movie has made a bigger impact on me than any other movie, music, book, you name it,- has ever had! It was shown to me by my teacher in culture history in a lecture a few years ago. Before showing this movie, he talked a little bit about what "castrati" means and is about, which I think everybody should know before seeing it so I highly recommend to read about it before watching this movie, to achieve best understanding. I only saw 20 minutes of the film because after 20 minutes of seeing it, my vision had gotten intensively impaired and was getting worse by the second! Then my throat started to close up, similar to asthmatic attacks which I do not have, and other students in the classroom noticed my odd behavior and before I knew it, all eyes were on me... I managed to stand up only to recklessly wander out in the hall, bouncing back and forth on the walls! Within seconds I lost consciousness and fell to the ground! I hadn't ever lost consciousness before so the feelings just before loosing consciousness was new to my mind and normally, I would be terrified and panicking but I was calm as a flower in windless weather! All I thought about, whilst freaking out other kids in the halls as if I was a drunk rapist, was this movie! The power of it! The beauty of it! The seductive tantalization of it! The school nurses and an educated doctor, couldn't find any cause why this would happen since I'm a healthy eating/living guy! But I knew all along, the hours on the hospital was in vain because it wasn't physical... It was...Farinelli...

    Farinelli may not to me be perfect, the sex scenes do get too much and I didn't find the lip synching to be anywhere near convincing as you can tell that the singing was not coming out of the actor. There are plenty of positives though. I personally did find the drama engrossing, true it isn't faithful from a historical standpoint, then again I can't think of any biopic of a musician or composer that didn't take some kind of liberty with the truth, but Farinelli is an emotionally-charged film and there was plenty of that. That is also true of the writing, which flows well and didn't feel jarring. The film looks spectacular, the costumes and sets are gorgeous to look at and is shot and directed beautifully. I have no faults with the music either, it is so good that my appreciation for early music further grew. The singing is equally wonderful, the scene in the theatre with the long high note was unbelievable. Stefano Dionisi is magnetic in the title role, Enrico Lo Verso brings intensity to the role of the "less talented" brother, Marianne Cellier has a very expressive face and Jereon Knabbe gives one of his best ever performances positively relishing his role as Handel(even if you question whether Handel was really like that). All in all, a very good film, fascinating and a visual and musical feast. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    reconstruction of a period. eulogy to an artist. impressive picture. and new film with old ingredients. maybe, not accuracy is its virtue. or the performance who may be admirable. the story - in few extraordinary moments. the art of director - yes, it is OK. but more important is the flavor. the touch of things, the silk of gestures, the cotton of words, the feeling to be part of action and the final impression , after the lost of fairy-tale skin, to discover a parable. this is great director secret - an universal lesson about yourself. instrument - magnificent music and a remarkable cast. a large light circle. and a wonderful science of detail. An Italian word says - Si non e vero, e ben trovato ( even it is not true, it is conceived ). in this case, it is perfect definition.

    In the 18th century, long before modern music could be canned for mass consumption, there existed a life-style which could only be sculpted from the unfortunate lives of prepubescent boys of Europe. This movie called " Farinelli " is the finest example of what was once deemed a most unique form of Opera. The story is based on the true story of two brothers who's father fettered them to a life of music and composition. Stefano Dionisi plays Carlo Broschi, AKA as Farinelli and his brother Riccardo Broschi (Enrico Lo Verso). Together they travel far and wide seeking not only an Opera loving audience, but also a rich patron who could afford their talent. The time of our story is set during the Baroque heyday of Frideric Handel (Jeroen Krabbe) who's great Classical music became the epitome of royalty and high society alike. The elder Broschi believes he did the right thing by suffering his younger brother to the excruciating pain of being castrated. However, he is then haunted by the fact his tortured brother has nightmares from the incident. Travel as the two boys do throughout the film, the story becomes more a testament of conscience, than one dealing with the audience appreciation of the day. Still, for Opera lovers or for those who enjoy good operatic theater, this movie delivers a cornucopia of both, with great period costumes and superior acting. Indeed, Stefano Dionisi and Jeroen Krabb&eacute; are superb as their lives play against each another. ****

    This film is a very correct biography of Carlo Broschi, the most famous castrato-countertenor of the 18th century, and of all times. Not only is it told in a simple and romantisized way, so that everyone can relate to it, but it explains what made him stand out above all the other superstar-castrati of that time, either in Italy and anywhere else. The writers of the story, Ren&eacute;e and G&eacute;rard Corbiau, use historical figures to make this clear, much the same way the author of Amadeus did: In reality, Antonio Salieri did NOT kill nor try to nor thought he did kill Mozart; he wasn't jealous of him at all, nor did he despise his personality or thought he didn't deserve the great talent he had received from God. In fact, Salieri, much like everybody else in Europe, was quite besotted about Wolfgang. He wasn't considered stupid nor vulgar (well, okay, he was, a bit; but people found that very funny in the 18th century), nor lacking merit. The author of 'Amadeus' simply used Salieri in order to show us how enormous Mozart's genius was, in a way he couldn't have done by merely tell the story of his life. The latter has been done several times, as a matter of fact, without ever having had the huge impact the film Amadeus had. But by doing it this way, it did the real Antonio Salieri great injustice. He used him as a character, not as a historical figure. In quite the same manner, the Corbiaus used George Friedrich Heandel and Ricardo Broschi, who in reality were both perfectly honorable and decent people and massively gifted composers; not to tell how great THEY were, but how great Farinelli was. Big brother Ricardo comes across, in this film, as a user, who profits from his exploited little brother both romantically, financially and musically, by first having him study music, having him castrated, writing mediocre music for him merely meant to demonstrate his extraordinary voice, much like a trained monkey. Ricardo, in this film, represents the popular music industry, which still exists today and is much the same: more interested in money and other gain than in beauty, art and perfection. This Ricardo has nothing in common with the real Ricardo Broschi, who took great care of his little brother after the untimely demise of their parents, was a mother and a father to him, hesitated painfully to give his permission for the castration (which was never performed unless at the distinct and repeated plead of the young singer himself), and finally wrote beautiful music. The Heandel-character on the other hand, represents an other group of people: the musical snobs, who DO know about beauty and perfection, but who let themselves be blinded by despising prejudice towards popular artists, whom the simple people worship. Those who think: if it's commercially successful, it can't possibly be anything but bad! The Heandel in "Farinelli", although formidably interpreted by Jeroen Krabb&eacute;, couldn't be further away from the real Heandel, who loved and respected his interpretors, who (like everybody else) was in awe before the dazzling talent of Carlo Broschi. Farinelli most probably would have become a great opera singer even without having been castrated: he would have been a tenor, maybe, or a countertenor, even a baritone, who will know? But in any case his love and comprehension of music and beauty, his soul was so great, he would have been a god of song anyways. No, in the story, poor Heandel is badly abused; this is however not the real Heandel. That one, the real one, is in the divine music filling this film to the rim. That's where the real Heandel and the real Ricardo Broschi are given the honor they deserve. 'Farinelli' tells how a gifted, but shallow pop star slowly evolves into a fantastic virtuoso, who forces the respect of everyone, and leaves all mediocrity behind. The performances are extraordinary. I think Carlo Broschi would have been pleased with this film about his life. It's not just a long ode to his greatness: it's a tale of the struggle a little boy has to go through to reach the top of his capabilities, accepting every suffering, every humiliation, every sacrifice it takes to get there.

    This was a fascinating story. I find myself very drawn to the kinky drama of the castrato singer -- and longing to hear what his voice really sounded like. I've been listening to recordings of Mozart's "Queen of the Night" aria recorded by women and boys nowadays and frustrated that everyone who sings it sounds strained and harsh -- wondering what Farinelli, the greatest singer in opera history, would have sounded like singing it. Unfortunately, I don't think the voice or the body in this movie were accurate. A castrato singer would have the lightness of a boy's voice. Sometimes the synthesized voice in this movie captured that, but generally it was too heavy. I sort of imagine a castrato soprano sounding more like Michael Jackson in "Little Susie," only probably higher. Also, this actor had a prominent Adam's apple, heavy bony structure around the eyes and jaw, and rippling muscles all over his body. A castrato, a person who had lacked testosterone since childhood, would lack all these things. He would have an angelic face, with childlike eyes -- more like the boy actor used for Farinelli before castration. The castrato would also have few visible muscles -- and certainly no visible Adam's apple. He might have enjoyed sex, but would have been unlikely to be so aggressive as this character was. Also, the idea that castrati could not achieve climax, as indicated in this movie was likely wrong. Moreover, not having gone through puberty, the castrato would likely have had a more gentle, childlike personality than this character, also endearing him to women. Women reportedly fainted when listening to the castrati sing. No one would have really fainted for the character in this movie. He just did not have the kind of eyes or the kind of voice to make a woman faint. It's as if the people who did the movie just were clueless. At the high point of the castrati, they were castrating 4,000 boys a year in Italy, supposedly. Presumably they were drawn to all that barbarism because the voices were really extraordinary, not merely high but of a quality to be drug-like in their beauty. I hope someone will try again -- and do better on the casting and synthesized singing this time. I want to be drawn into the vocal experience that was so amazing that they would castrate little boys to achieve it.

    The sets and costumes are magnificent and give a 21st century viewer a glimpse of what life must have been like for the fortunate wealthy in the days of the baroque composers, but the story is confusing and there was far too much gratuitous sex. It was as if the filmmakers did not think that the beautiful music and sumptuous settings could carry the film. I don't know if something was lost in the subtitling, or whether too much film was left on he cutting room floor, but I was baffled by a number of the characters. Who was Benjamin and why did he wear a body brace? Who were Alexandra and Margareth? The characters simply seemed to be a device to move the story along to the bizarre and unnecessary sex scenes. My biggest problem was with the poor lip synching, which was so obvious that it distracted and spoiled the flow of the film. It was not just that the facial mannerisms did not match the voice, but that the volume actually dropped to the extent that the voice seemed to be coming from off stage. Nowhere was this worse than the trumpet scene at the beginning. The castrati had very powerful voices, but Farinelli's voice sounds like a far-off squeak. Synching has been done very successfully in the past, most notably by Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady and Ava Gardner is Show Boat, and most famously by Edmund Purdom in the Student Prince, so it should not be beyond the capability of film makers 40 or more years later. I felt that the film would have been more convincing if Farinelli had been played by a soprano doing her own singing, and had concentrated more on the relationship with the brother who was riding on Farinelli's coat tails. How often have we seen a partnership where one half is nothing without the other, and knows it. As for the comparison with the decadent rock star life style, that is how the castrati stars allegedly lived in the hedonistic 18th-century. I am not sure either that the castrati strutted around the stage like drag queens as they were supposed to be playing the women's parts as women. Given Ken Russell’s record of appallingly bad taste portrayals of musicians, it is surprising that he never attempted this one. It was right up his street. Opera lovers would be better served by listening to recordings of Handels operas.

    This movie has something of a kinship with "Amadeus," portraying as it does the important cultural significance of music in a very different time and place - far more significant than music is today - but it's a much darker movie than "Amadeus" (which itself has some dark undertones.) The movie gives a glimpse into the life of Carlo Roschi (better known as Farinelli) - one of the great opera singers of the 18th century. Farinelli (played by Stefano Dionisi) was a castrato - castrated as a young boy in order to preserve his brilliant soprano voice. Admittedly, it's a bit off putting to see a male portrayed as singing soprano (I say portrayed, because I assume Dionisi was lip-synching, since we don't have castratos today.) But while Farinelli's singing was the centerpiece of the movie, what's really being portrayed here (and, from what I've been able to glean, not entirely accurately, although I'm no expert on 18th century opera singers!) are the complex relationships in Farinelli's life - especially his relationship with his brother Riccardo (Enrico Lo Verso.) Carlo was the brilliant singer; Riccardo seems to have been a rather average composer - but, trying to keep a promise made to their father, they work as a team. The relationship is bizarre, and sometimes even vaguely erotic. Riccardo describes a love between them more passionate than that between lovers - and perhaps because of that passion there are huge amounts of jealousy and anger as well as love. The two brothers share everything - including women, in what are portrayed as strange tag-team sorts of sexual encounters, where - to put it bluntly - Riccardo finishes what Carlo can only start. There's also an interesting exploration of Farinelli's relationship with the great composer Handel (Jeroen Krabbe), which revolves around their work for rival opera houses in London. It's really very interesting. The movie is mostly in Italian and French, which necessitates subtitles for English speakers, which I always find a bit distracting. I was also disappointed that the movie depicts virtually nothing of Farinelli's time in the Spanish court, where Farinelli became court musician to King Philip V - and apparently very influential, as well. Still, it's very well done, and you don't have to be a fan of opera to enjoy this. 8/10
