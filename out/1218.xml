    Friday is one of the greatest and funniest Comedies of all time,an excellent Comedy that mixes hilarious scenes,great characters,quotable dialog and a great soundtrack. All of those combinations make Friday a Cult Classic,Comedy Classic and one of my favorite Comedies and favorite films of all time. Set in a neighborhood in South Central,Los Angeles,Friday tells the story of Craig(Ice Cube)and his weed smoking drug dealing best friend Smokey(Chris Tucker)who hangout on Craig's porch talking,getting high and dealing with various characters while getting into funny situations and showing that a lot of things can happen between Thursday and Saturday. Friday is an excellent Comedy and a Cult classic that had to be made and came out at the right time in 1995 and it was needed for South Central Los Angeles. Before Friday,the city of L.A was almost in a frozen state at the time because of the L.A Riots in 1992 and urban classics like Boyz N The Hood and Menace II Society gave movie goers dark visions of African-Americans growing in SC L.A where in those films it was always death and doom and gloom with no since of hope and at the time with the exception of the House Party films and a few others Black urban Comedies we're few and far between in the early to mid-90s. Friday took a different and much lighter approach to urban films and basically said while living in the ghetto or hood can be depressing and said,it can also be funny as well giving us one of the funniest films of all time and when you watch the film on cable,video or DVD you never turn it off. One of the many reasons that Friday is such an excellent and hilarious movie is because the situations and dialog are funny and real,because if you grew up in the ghetto you have seen characters in the film in everyday life and it will relate to viewers. The Comedy in the film works so well because the Comedy just strikes a perfect balance between hilarious character driven dialog and at times over the top Humor. The screenplay by Ice Cube and D.J Pooh is wonderful,giving the characters in the film memorable dialog and great moments that don't feel forced or fake,but feel very real and very authentic. I love movies that are set in 24 hours or movies that are set in one day and Friday is one of the best films set in one single day and like the best films set in 24 hours there is Comedy but there's also some lessons learned. While Friday is hilarious and filled with great Humor the film takes a little time to talk about some of the harsh realities of living in the hood and what happens in South Central so while Friday is a Comedy and a very funny one at that it is also morality tale as well but it's not a sad or bleak morality tale like Boyz N The Hood or Menace II Society were. Craig and Smokey are a classic duo because like most great duo's there is a funny character and there is the straight forward character that is serious and the back and forth dialog and banter between the two is classic and iconic. You can tell that Craig and Smokey genuinely care for one another and will do anything for each other and as funny as the characters are they are well developed and likable. Like Craig and Smokey we are watching and seeing the things going on in their own neighborhood which for them is a normal thing,but to most viewers is hilarious and insane. The ending of the film is a classic conclusion that is funny and intense at the same time and after you look at this film you will never look at the day Friday the same way again. The cast is excellent in their roles. Ice Cube is great and funny as Craig,with Cube playing it straight and real. Chris Tucker is hilarious and excellent in his star making performance as Smokey,with Tucker saying funny lines,talking at fast paced and having great chemistry with Cube. Nia Long is wonderful and sexy as Debbie,Craig's love interest. Tiny 'Zeus' Lister Jr. is menacing and great as Deebo,the neighborhood bully. John Witherspoon is funny as always as Mr.Jones, Jones,Craig's Father. Faizon Love(Big Worm),Anthony Johnson(Ezal),Regina King(Dana),Anna Maria Horsford(Mrs. Jones),Paula Jai Parker(Joi),Bernie Mac(Pastor Clever),DJ Pooh(Red),Yvette Wilson(Rita),Ronn Riser(Stanley),Angela Means(Felisha),Kathleen Bradley(Mrs. Parker),Tony Cox(Mr. Parker),Demetrius Navarro(Hector),Jason Bose Smith(Lil' Chris)and Vickilyn Reynolds(Joann)give fun performances as well. The direction by F.Gary Gray is simple,yet great with Gray pointing and shooting,but at the same time still moving the camera and giving the film an a great energy and pace. Great direction,Gray. The score by Frank Fitzpatrick,Simon Franglen and Chuck Wild is is great and memorable and fits with the film's tone. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs from Dr. Dre(Keep Their Heads Ringin),Ice Cube(Friday),The Isley Brothers(Trying' To See Another Day)as well as classics from Curtis Mayfield(Freddie's Dead,Little Child,Running Wild),The Temptations(The Way You Do Things You Do),James Brown(Get Up(I Feel Like Being A Sex Machine),Rose Royce(I Wanna Get Next To You),Rick James(Mary Jane)and War(Low Rider)and other great songs Excellent soundtrack. In final word,if you love Comedy films,Urban films,Stoner films,Hip-Hop,Rap or films in general, I highly suggest you see Friday,a classic Comedy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended 10/10.

    My feelings towards the movie "Friday" is excitement. The film's quality and enjoyment level is high. It's not quite a family movie but it has adult fun in it. The film, which stars a cast of great African American actors such as Ice Cube, Chris Tucker, John Witherspoon and Bernie Mac, was directed by Gary Gray. A young man who just lost his job gets the help of his best friend to make a quick buck. But this experience is not what either of them expected to go through. They are hassled, hustled, chased, robbed and beat up but still stuck together. The comedy level in this film is through the roof. A true classic movie at its best, the lessons taught in the movie are also good. Ice Cube, who played Craig, was the main actor. His portrayal of a young man who just lost his job and has the pressure of his family on his back was great. Craig's friend in the movie was Smokey, Co-starred by Chris Tucker. His role was to be the joke telling, crazy, loose cannon friend we all have. The films use of small side stories and background stories into the key actor's lives was an eye opener for the viewer. It gave the plot depth and stability. The music choices weren't that important into the story, there really wasn't a soundtrack to the film. Even though this was a comedy, the few serious or important moments were enhanced so that the viewer would sense the importance of that scene. I personal recommend this movie to all who likes adult comedy. This film is a classic and its sequels even deserve a chance. Also the turn at the end is one to remember. My overall feeling towards this movie is a great two thumbs up.

    I'm going to keep this short and sweet, enough people have already gave the rundown of characters, summary and their thoughts on movie. But I felt i needed to write this due to Critics speaking so badly about this Classic Movie. This movie is amazing and there's nothing else to possibly say. I give it 100/100 and I prefer watching it if you haven't already. I have seen this movie over 50+ times and it never gets old to me. Well all i have to say and I'm pretty sure others will agree. Chris Tucker played a excellent role in the movie and with Ice Cube in it it just made the movie that much better. I love this movie and honestly I think this is the ONLY Friday that I like. This was simple, funny and just always entertaining to watch.

    This is one of the few good comedies to ever come out of the 90's. The film is about Craig played by Ice Cube and his buddy Smokey played by Chris Tucker who are faced with the dilemma of paying Smokey's boss $200 by the end of the day or they are dead. And that's just about it. While this film is simple I enjoyed and laughed frequently. The neighborhood has a lot of colorful Characters and Chris Tucker steals the whole show. Sorry this one is short but There is just not a lot to write about this film. Rated R For Pervasive Strong Language And Drug Use, And For A Brutal Fight. Theatrical Cut: 1hr 31min/91min. Director's Cut: 1hr 37min/97min. 85 uses of the F-word. ****/****

    1995's "Friday" is one of the best comedies to feature an entirely black cast of actors from the '90s. "Friday" has been a long-time personal favorite of mine since about 1999 - four years after this film's original 1995 theatrical release and just one year before the release of its sequel "Next Friday" (2000). Following in the footsteps of neo-blaxploitation 'hood movies from the early '90s, "Friday" is somewhat of a parody of films such as "Boyz N the Hood" (1991) and "Menace II Society" (1993), but with a Cheech & Chong-styled, urban stoner twist. It comes in between the seriousness of "Boyz" and "Menace" (but before the 'hood-movie silliness of 1996's "Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood") and the PC 21st-century preachiness of Tyler Perry. But that doesn't mean that "Friday" still isn't saying SOMETHING meaningful. In its own unique, un-preachy way, "Friday" critiques the (still-relevant) epidemic of unemployment in the black community while also throwing wickedly pointed barbs at U.S. drug laws (particularly as they pertain to marijuana). A Lot Can And Does Go Down Between Thursday And Saturday in "Friday," which marked the big-screen debut of former music video director F. Gary Gray. On one particularly eventful Friday in South Central Los Angeles, recently unemployed Craig Jones (rapper Ice Cube) wakes up with no job, nowhere to go, and nothing to do. The plot is pretty thin as he and best bud Smokey (hilarious Chris Tucker) observe the goings-on in their neighborhood and all of the film's colorful cast of neighborhood characters. Things get really going when Smokey suddenly becomes indebted to local drug dealer Big Worm (Faizon Love) for $200 after smoking up the same merchandise that he was supposed to be selling, which also leads to a violent ending confrontation with towering neighborhood bully Deebo (Tiny "Zeus" Lister, Jr.). "Friday" really does breeze through its plot and characters and does so with a funny, laugh-a-minute script penned by none other than Ice Cube himself and co-screenwriter DJ Pooh (who also appears in the film as Craig's co-worker Red). Chris Tucker's Smokey seems to get the best laughs and one-liners here. With his nasal, high-pitched voice and manic mannerisms, he proves to be a reliable comic foil to Ice Cube's more level-headed Everyman Craig and is the film's comedic centerpiece. John Witherspoon brings a seasoned maturity to his role as Craig's Dad, a hilarious cameo by the late Bernic Mac as Pastor Clever is perfectly timed, and Nia Long livens up any scene she appears as the girl next door Debbie. Since F. Gary Gray is a former music video director making his big debut here, the movie does also have a wonderful hip-hop/'70s soul soundtrack that features Ice Cube himself, Dr. Dre (still riding high at the time on the popularity of his trademarked "G"-funk sound), Cypress Hill, Scarface (of Geto Boys), Mack 10 and 2 Live Crew, plus old-school funk/R & B talents such as the late Rick James, Bootsy Collins & Bernie Worrell, and The Isley Brothers. Such a selection of artists proves he knows his black music very well. 10/10

    Proof positive that you don't need a big budget and special effects to make a great movie. "Friday" is all about comedy, the characters, and great storytelling. This movie is a classic comedy that stars Ice Cube, John Witherspoon, Nia Long, the late Bernie Mac, Regina King, Anna Maria Horsford and Chris Tucker in his breakthrough role as Smokie. It follows a day (Friday) in the life of Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and his best friend Smokie, who in my opinion, steals the show. This is the movie that would define the rest of Chris Tucker's career. You know that the film is low-budget, but F. Gary Gary's experience as video director shows here with his ability to tell a story on a small budget. The pace of the movie is flawless, as we me from one funny incident to the next. All the elements of the subplots get intertwined together for the climax of the film. It's executed brilliantly. I have this movie in my DVD collect and have seen it at least two dozen times. I know all the words to the dialogue by heart. It's just that good! The two sequels to this film, "Next Friday" and "Friday After Next" were bigger box office hits, but they also had bigger budgets. Still, these two pale in comparison to the original when it comes to great movie making. Not even Rebecca Black can foul this "Friday".

    This movie gets better every time I watch it simply because how well it's written. The acting is great for a comedy film and the story is smoothly played out in the course of one day. Friday is one of those films that doesn't try to be obnoxiously funny every second (like Step Brothers) and because of this, it's funnier than most comedy movies that come out today. Also because it is just plain hilarious all around. The actors were chosen wisely and all do their part great. The story is interesting and funny while not being too crazy in order to generate laughs (like The Hangover Part II, which I still love anyway) There isn't much to say about this movie besides the fact that it's hilarious, quotable and overall very memorable. This is like the Pineapple Express of the 90's. So if you're looking for a funny ass movie, go find it and watch it. You wont regret it.

    OPEN LETTER: I have been watching this movie since I was 6 years old.This movie? This movie right here? I can watch this movie over and over and I still laugh. ALL my friends love it. White, Black, Asian - It's great and funny! It can be defined in one word: CLASSIC! ACTUAL REVIEW: Wanna laugh? Watch this. Classic characters, classic soundtrack , classic tale, classic LINES! It is also very relate-able. We all know a Smokey "the pothead" or a Craig "the responsible one." Even though it was made in the 90's, this movie defies generations because of that fact. It is truly underrated by A LOT of critics! IN THE END... WATCH IT! RENT IT! BUY IT! STEAL IT! (okay don't do the last one) But just watch it! I give it 9 out of 10 stars.

    Watched the movie 15 years after its release and enjoyed it to its bone. Rent it and watch it in the late afternoons of the summer kind of a movie. The characters in the movie are real funny and the actors have done a good job. Personally i feel this is one of the funniest black movie of all times.Chris's character has pulled off the movie, a smoke head getting in all sorts of trouble not as Chong but saner and much more funnier. This is one of the movies that you want to watch again and again. Ice Cube has done a great job with the script. With a serious situation on the hands of ghetto guys where one is doped and care free, and the other unlucky, find out ways to sort one problem after the other. I don't understand why Chris hasn't done more films, good actor, not bad at all. You watch this and you go to the store looking for more of Chris to find almost nothing except Rush Hour.

    1995's "Friday" is one of the best comedies to feature an entirely black cast of actors from the '90s. "Friday" has been a long-time personal favorite of mine since about 1999 - four years after this film's original 1995 theatrical release and just one year before the release of its sequel "Next Friday" (2000). Following in the footsteps of neo-blaxploitation 'hood movies from the early '90s, "Friday" is somewhat of a parody of films such as "Boyz N the Hood" (1991) and "Menace II Society" (1993), but with a Cheech & Chong-styled, urban stoner twist. It comes in between the seriousness of "Boyz" and "Menace" (but before the 'hood-movie silliness of 1996's "Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood") and the PC 21st-century preachiness of Tyler Perry. But that doesn't mean that "Friday" still isn't saying SOMETHING meaningful. In its own unique, un-preachy way, "Friday" critiques the (still-relevant) epidemic of unemployment in the black community while also throwing wickedly pointed barbs at U.S. drug laws (particularly as they pertain to marijuana). A Lot Can And Does Go Down Between Thursday And Saturday in "Friday," which marked the big-screen debut of former music video director F. Gary Gray. On one particularly eventful Friday in South Central Los Angeles, recently unemployed Craig Jones (rapper Ice Cube) wakes up with no job, nowhere to go, and nothing to do. The plot is pretty thin as he and best bud Smokey (hilarious Chris Tucker) observe the goings-on in their neighborhood and all of the film's colorful cast of neighborhood characters. Things get really going when Smokey suddenly becomes indebted to local drug dealer Big Worm (Faizon Love) for $200 after smoking up the same merchandise that he was supposed to be selling, which also leads to a violent ending confrontation with towering neighborhood bully Deebo (Tiny "Zeus" Lister, Jr.). "Friday" really does breeze through its plot and characters and does so with a funny, laugh-a-minute script penned by none other than Ice Cube himself and co-screenwriter DJ Pooh (who also appears in the film as Craig's co-worker Red). Chris Tucker's Smokey seems to get the best laughs and one-liners here. With his nasal, high-pitched voice and manic mannerisms, he proves to be a reliable comic foil to Ice Cube's more level-headed Everyman Craig and is the film's comedic centerpiece. John Witherspoon brings a seasoned maturity to his role as Craig's Dad, a hilarious cameo by the late Bernic Mac as Pastor Clever is perfectly timed, and Nia Long livens up any scene she appears as the girl next door Debbie. Since F. Gary Gray is a former music video director making his big debut here, the movie does also have a wonderful hip-hop/'70s soul soundtrack that features Ice Cube himself, Dr. Dre (still riding high at the time on the popularity of his trademarked "G"-funk sound), Cypress Hill, Scarface (of Geto Boys), Mack 10 and 2 Live Crew, plus old-school funk/R & B talents such as the late Rick James, Bootsy Collins & Bernie Worrell, and The Isley Brothers. Such a selection of artists proves he knows his black music very well. 10/10

    Proof positive that you don't need a big budget and special effects to make a great movie. "Friday" is all about comedy, the characters, and great storytelling. This movie is a classic comedy that stars Ice Cube, John Witherspoon, Nia Long, the late Bernie Mac, Regina King, Anna Maria Horsford and Chris Tucker in his breakthrough role as Smokie. It follows a day (Friday) in the life of Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and his best friend Smokie, who in my opinion, steals the show. This is the movie that would define the rest of Chris Tucker's career. You know that the film is low-budget, but F. Gary Gary's experience as video director shows here with his ability to tell a story on a small budget. The pace of the movie is flawless, as we me from one funny incident to the next. All the elements of the subplots get intertwined together for the climax of the film. It's executed brilliantly. I have this movie in my DVD collect and have seen it at least two dozen times. I know all the words to the dialogue by heart. It's just that good! The two sequels to this film, "Next Friday" and "Friday After Next" were bigger box office hits, but they also had bigger budgets. Still, these two pale in comparison to the original when it comes to great movie making. Not even Rebecca Black can foul this "Friday".

    This movie gets better every time I watch it simply because how well it's written. The acting is great for a comedy film and the story is smoothly played out in the course of one day. Friday is one of those films that doesn't try to be obnoxiously funny every second (like Step Brothers) and because of this, it's funnier than most comedy movies that come out today. Also because it is just plain hilarious all around. The actors were chosen wisely and all do their part great. The story is interesting and funny while not being too crazy in order to generate laughs (like The Hangover Part II, which I still love anyway) There isn't much to say about this movie besides the fact that it's hilarious, quotable and overall very memorable. This is like the Pineapple Express of the 90's. So if you're looking for a funny ass movie, go find it and watch it. You wont regret it.

    OPEN LETTER: I have been watching this movie since I was 6 years old.This movie? This movie right here? I can watch this movie over and over and I still laugh. ALL my friends love it. White, Black, Asian - It's great and funny! It can be defined in one word: CLASSIC! ACTUAL REVIEW: Wanna laugh? Watch this. Classic characters, classic soundtrack , classic tale, classic LINES! It is also very relate-able. We all know a Smokey "the pothead" or a Craig "the responsible one." Even though it was made in the 90's, this movie defies generations because of that fact. It is truly underrated by A LOT of critics! IN THE END... WATCH IT! RENT IT! BUY IT! STEAL IT! (okay don't do the last one) But just watch it! I give it 9 out of 10 stars.

    Watched the movie 15 years after its release and enjoyed it to its bone. Rent it and watch it in the late afternoons of the summer kind of a movie. The characters in the movie are real funny and the actors have done a good job. Personally i feel this is one of the funniest black movie of all times.Chris's character has pulled off the movie, a smoke head getting in all sorts of trouble not as Chong but saner and much more funnier. This is one of the movies that you want to watch again and again. Ice Cube has done a great job with the script. With a serious situation on the hands of ghetto guys where one is doped and care free, and the other unlucky, find out ways to sort one problem after the other. I don't understand why Chris hasn't done more films, good actor, not bad at all. You watch this and you go to the store looking for more of Chris to find almost nothing except Rush Hour.

    Friday is one of the greatest and funniest Comedies of all time,an excellent Comedy that mixes hilarious scenes,great characters,quotable dialog and a great soundtrack. All of those combinations make Friday a Cult Classic,Comedy Classic and one of my favorite Comedies and favorite films of all time. Set in a neighborhood in South Central,Los Angeles,Friday tells the story of Craig(Ice Cube)and his weed smoking drug dealing best friend Smokey(Chris Tucker)who hangout on Craig's porch talking,getting high and dealing with various characters while getting into funny situations and showing that a lot of things can happen between Thursday and Saturday. Friday is an excellent Comedy and a Cult classic that had to be made and came out at the right time in 1995 and it was needed for South Central Los Angeles. Before Friday,the city of L.A was almost in a frozen state at the time because of the L.A Riots in 1992 and urban classics like Boyz N The Hood and Menace II Society gave movie goers dark visions of African-Americans growing in SC L.A where in those films it was always death and doom and gloom with no since of hope and at the time with the exception of the House Party films and a few others Black urban Comedies we're few and far between in the early to mid-90s. Friday took a different and much lighter approach to urban films and basically said while living in the ghetto or hood can be depressing and said,it can also be funny as well giving us one of the funniest films of all time and when you watch the film on cable,video or DVD you never turn it off. One of the many reasons that Friday is such an excellent and hilarious movie is because the situations and dialog are funny and real,because if you grew up in the ghetto you have seen characters in the film in everyday life and it will relate to viewers. The Comedy in the film works so well because the Comedy just strikes a perfect balance between hilarious character driven dialog and at times over the top Humor. The screenplay by Ice Cube and D.J Pooh is wonderful,giving the characters in the film memorable dialog and great moments that don't feel forced or fake,but feel very real and very authentic. I love movies that are set in 24 hours or movies that are set in one day and Friday is one of the best films set in one single day and like the best films set in 24 hours there is Comedy but there's also some lessons learned. While Friday is hilarious and filled with great Humor the film takes a little time to talk about some of the harsh realities of living in the hood and what happens in South Central so while Friday is a Comedy and a very funny one at that it is also morality tale as well but it's not a sad or bleak morality tale like Boyz N The Hood or Menace II Society were. Craig and Smokey are a classic duo because like most great duo's there is a funny character and there is the straight forward character that is serious and the back and forth dialog and banter between the two is classic and iconic. You can tell that Craig and Smokey genuinely care for one another and will do anything for each other and as funny as the characters are they are well developed and likable. Like Craig and Smokey we are watching and seeing the things going on in their own neighborhood which for them is a normal thing,but to most viewers is hilarious and insane. The ending of the film is a classic conclusion that is funny and intense at the same time and after you look at this film you will never look at the day Friday the same way again. The cast is excellent in their roles. Ice Cube is great and funny as Craig,with Cube playing it straight and real. Chris Tucker is hilarious and excellent in his star making performance as Smokey,with Tucker saying funny lines,talking at fast paced and having great chemistry with Cube. Nia Long is wonderful and sexy as Debbie,Craig's love interest. Tiny 'Zeus' Lister Jr. is menacing and great as Deebo,the neighborhood bully. John Witherspoon is funny as always as Mr.Jones, Jones,Craig's Father. Faizon Love(Big Worm),Anthony Johnson(Ezal),Regina King(Dana),Anna Maria Horsford(Mrs. Jones),Paula Jai Parker(Joi),Bernie Mac(Pastor Clever),DJ Pooh(Red),Yvette Wilson(Rita),Ronn Riser(Stanley),Angela Means(Felisha),Kathleen Bradley(Mrs. Parker),Tony Cox(Mr. Parker),Demetrius Navarro(Hector),Jason Bose Smith(Lil' Chris)and Vickilyn Reynolds(Joann)give fun performances as well. The direction by F.Gary Gray is simple,yet great with Gray pointing and shooting,but at the same time still moving the camera and giving the film an a great energy and pace. Great direction,Gray. The score by Frank Fitzpatrick,Simon Franglen and Chuck Wild is is great and memorable and fits with the film's tone. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs from Dr. Dre(Keep Their Heads Ringin),Ice Cube(Friday),The Isley Brothers(Trying' To See Another Day)as well as classics from Curtis Mayfield(Freddie's Dead,Little Child,Running Wild),The Temptations(The Way You Do Things You Do),James Brown(Get Up(I Feel Like Being A Sex Machine),Rose Royce(I Wanna Get Next To You),Rick James(Mary Jane)and War(Low Rider)and other great songs Excellent soundtrack. In final word,if you love Comedy films,Urban films,Stoner films,Hip-Hop,Rap or films in general, I highly suggest you see Friday,a classic Comedy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended 10/10.

    My feelings towards the movie "Friday" is excitement. The film's quality and enjoyment level is high. It's not quite a family movie but it has adult fun in it. The film, which stars a cast of great African American actors such as Ice Cube, Chris Tucker, John Witherspoon and Bernie Mac, was directed by Gary Gray. A young man who just lost his job gets the help of his best friend to make a quick buck. But this experience is not what either of them expected to go through. They are hassled, hustled, chased, robbed and beat up but still stuck together. The comedy level in this film is through the roof. A true classic movie at its best, the lessons taught in the movie are also good. Ice Cube, who played Craig, was the main actor. His portrayal of a young man who just lost his job and has the pressure of his family on his back was great. Craig's friend in the movie was Smokey, Co-starred by Chris Tucker. His role was to be the joke telling, crazy, loose cannon friend we all have. The films use of small side stories and background stories into the key actor's lives was an eye opener for the viewer. It gave the plot depth and stability. The music choices weren't that important into the story, there really wasn't a soundtrack to the film. Even though this was a comedy, the few serious or important moments were enhanced so that the viewer would sense the importance of that scene. I personal recommend this movie to all who likes adult comedy. This film is a classic and its sequels even deserve a chance. Also the turn at the end is one to remember. My overall feeling towards this movie is a great two thumbs up.

    I'm going to keep this short and sweet, enough people have already gave the rundown of characters, summary and their thoughts on movie. But I felt i needed to write this due to Critics speaking so badly about this Classic Movie. This movie is amazing and there's nothing else to possibly say. I give it 100/100 and I prefer watching it if you haven't already. I have seen this movie over 50+ times and it never gets old to me. Well all i have to say and I'm pretty sure others will agree. Chris Tucker played a excellent role in the movie and with Ice Cube in it it just made the movie that much better. I love this movie and honestly I think this is the ONLY Friday that I like. This was simple, funny and just always entertaining to watch.

    This is one of the few good comedies to ever come out of the 90's. The film is about Craig played by Ice Cube and his buddy Smokey played by Chris Tucker who are faced with the dilemma of paying Smokey's boss $200 by the end of the day or they are dead. And that's just about it. While this film is simple I enjoyed and laughed frequently. The neighborhood has a lot of colorful Characters and Chris Tucker steals the whole show. Sorry this one is short but There is just not a lot to write about this film. Rated R For Pervasive Strong Language And Drug Use, And For A Brutal Fight. Theatrical Cut: 1hr 31min/91min. Director's Cut: 1hr 37min/97min. 85 uses of the F-word. ****/****

    One of the funniest/greatest films ever made, i mean this was Ice Cubes first written movie. I read on the internet that John Singleton told Ice Cube if he can write music he can write movies and ice Cube did a Fantastic JOB. Ice Cube wrote a classic. out of all the movies i watched Friday is the most watched.I have a VCR/DVD thing and on weekday nights i put Friday in or even on the weekends, and i just laugh. Smokey got Craig high and they just had fun on a Friday. Directed by DJ pooh/written by Ice Cube. This movie is a 10/10

    Friday is one of the greatest and funniest Comedies of all time,an excellent Comedy that mixes hilarious scenes,great characters,quotable dialog and a great soundtrack. All of those combinations make Friday a Cult Classic,Comedy Classic and one of my favorite Comedies and favorite films of all time.

Nia Long is wonderful and sexy as Debbie,Craig's love interest. Tiny 'Zeus' Lister Jr. is menacing and great as Deebo,the neighborhood bully. John Witherspoon is funny as always as Mr.Jones, Jones,Craig's Father. Faizon Love(Big Worm),Anthony Johnson(Ezal),Regina King(Dana),Anna Maria Horsford(Mrs. Jones),Paula Jai Parker(Joi),Bernie Mac(Pastor Clever),DJ Pooh(Red),Yvette Wilson(Rita),Ronn Riser(Stanley),Angela Means(Felisha),Kathleen Bradley(Mrs. Parker),Tony Cox(Mr. Parker),Demetrius Navarro(Hector),Jason Bose Smith(Lil' Chris)and Vickilyn Reynolds(Joann)give fun performances as well. The direction by F.Gary Gray is simple,yet great with Gray pointing and shooting,but at the same time still moving the camera and giving the film an a great energy and pace. Great direction,Gray. The score by Frank Fitzpatrick,Simon Franglen and Chuck Wild is is great and memorable and fits with the film's tone. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs from Dr. Dre(Keep Their Heads Ringin),Ice Cube(Friday),The Isley Brothers(Trying' To See Another Day)as well as classics from Curtis Mayfield(Freddie's Dead,Little Child,Running Wild),The Temptations(The Way You Do Things You Do),James Brown(Get Up(I Feel Like Being A Sex Machine),Rose Royce(I Wanna Get Next To You),Rick James(Mary Jane)and War(Low Rider)and other great songs Excellent soundtrack. In final word,if you love Comedy films,Urban films,Stoner films,Hip-Hop,Rap or films in general, I highly suggest you see Friday,a classic Comedy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended 10/10.

    My feelings towards the movie "Friday" is excitement. The film's quality and enjoyment level is high. It's not quite a family movie but it has adult fun in it. The film, which stars a cast of great African American actors such as Ice Cube, Chris Tucker, John Witherspoon and Bernie Mac, was directed by Gary Gray. A young man who just lost his job gets the help of his best friend to make a quick buck. But this experience is not what either of them expected to go through. They are hassled, hustled, chased, robbed and beat up but still stuck together. The comedy level in this film is through the roof. A true classic movie at its best, the lessons taught in the movie are also good. Ice Cube, who played Craig, was the main actor. His portrayal of a young man who just lost his job and has the pressure of his family on his back was great. Craig's friend in the movie was Smokey, Co-starred by Chris Tucker. His role was to be the joke telling, crazy, loose cannon friend we all have. The films use of small side stories and background stories into the key actor's lives was an eye opener for the viewer. It gave the plot depth and stability. The music choices weren't that important into the story, there really wasn't a soundtrack to the film. Even though this was a comedy, the few serious or important moments were enhanced so that the viewer would sense the importance of that scene. I personal recommend this movie to all who likes adult comedy. This film is a classic and its sequels even deserve a chance. Also the turn at the end is one to remember. My overall feeling towards this movie is a great two thumbs up.

    I'm going to keep this short and sweet, enough people have already gave the rundown of characters, summary and their thoughts on movie. But I felt i needed to write this due to Critics speaking so badly about this Classic Movie. This movie is amazing and there's nothing else to possibly say. I give it 100/100 and I prefer watching it if you haven't already. I have seen this movie over 50+ times and it never gets old to me. Well all i have to say and I'm pretty sure others will agree. Chris Tucker played a excellent role in the movie and with Ice Cube in it it just made the movie that much better. I love this movie and honestly I think this is the ONLY Friday that I like. This was simple, funny and just always entertaining to watch.

    This is one of the few good comedies to ever come out of the 90's. The film is about Craig played by Ice Cube and his buddy Smokey played by Chris Tucker who are faced with the dilemma of paying Smokey's boss $200 by the end of the day or they are dead. And that's just about it. While this film is simple I enjoyed and laughed frequently. The neighborhood has a lot of colorful Characters and Chris Tucker steals the whole show. Sorry this one is short but There is just not a lot to write about this film. Rated R For Pervasive Strong Language And Drug Use, And For A Brutal Fight. Theatrical Cut: 1hr 31min/91min. Director's Cut: 1hr 37min/97min. 85 uses of the F-word. ****/****

    1995's "Friday" is one of the best comedies to feature an entirely black cast of actors from the '90s. "Friday" has been a long-time personal favorite of mine since about 1999 - four years after this film's original 1995 theatrical release and just one year before the release of its sequel "Next Friday" (2000). Following in the footsteps of neo-blaxploitation 'hood movies from the early '90s, "Friday" is somewhat of a parody of films such as "Boyz N the Hood" (1991) and "Menace II Society" (1993), but with a Cheech & Chong-styled, urban stoner twist. It comes in between the seriousness of "Boyz" and "Menace" (but before the 'hood-movie silliness of 1996's "Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood") and the PC 21st-century preachiness of Tyler Perry. But that doesn't mean that "Friday" still isn't saying SOMETHING meaningful. In its own unique, un-preachy way, "Friday" critiques the (still-relevant) epidemic of unemployment in the black community while also throwing wickedly pointed barbs at U.S. drug laws (particularly as they pertain to marijuana). A Lot Can And Does Go Down Between Thursday And Saturday in "Friday," which marked the big-screen debut of former music video director F. Gary Gray. On one particularly eventful Friday in South Central Los Angeles, recently unemployed Craig Jones (rapper Ice Cube) wakes up with no job, nowhere to go, and nothing to do. The plot is pretty thin as he and best bud Smokey (hilarious Chris Tucker) observe the goings-on in their neighborhood and all of the film's colorful cast of neighborhood characters. Things get really going when Smokey suddenly becomes indebted to local drug dealer Big Worm (Faizon Love) for $200 after smoking up the same merchandise that he was supposed to be selling, which also leads to a violent ending confrontation with towering neighborhood bully Deebo (Tiny "Zeus" Lister, Jr.). "Friday" really does breeze through its plot and characters and does so with a funny, laugh-a-minute script penned by none other than Ice Cube himself and co-screenwriter DJ Pooh (who also appears in the film as Craig's co-worker Red). Chris Tucker's Smokey seems to get the best laughs and one-liners here. With his nasal, high-pitched voice and manic mannerisms, he proves to be a reliable comic foil to Ice Cube's more level-headed Everyman Craig and is the film's comedic centerpiece. John Witherspoon brings a seasoned maturity to his role as Craig's Dad, a hilarious cameo by the late Bernic Mac as Pastor Clever is perfectly timed, and Nia Long livens up any scene she appears as the girl next door Debbie. Since F. Gary Gray is a former music video director making his big debut here, the movie does also have a wonderful hip-hop/'70s soul soundtrack that features Ice Cube himself, Dr. Dre (still riding high at the time on the popularity of his trademarked "G"-funk sound), Cypress Hill, Scarface (of Geto Boys), Mack 10 and 2 Live Crew, plus old-school funk/R & B talents such as the late Rick James, Bootsy Collins & Bernie Worrell, and The Isley Brothers. Such a selection of artists proves he knows his black music very well. 10/10

    Proof positive that you don't need a big budget and special effects to make a great movie. "Friday" is all about comedy, the characters, and great storytelling. This movie is a classic comedy that stars Ice Cube, John Witherspoon, Nia Long, the late Bernie Mac, Regina King, Anna Maria Horsford and Chris Tucker in his breakthrough role as Smokie. It follows a day (Friday) in the life of Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and his best friend Smokie, who in my opinion, steals the show. This is the movie that would define the rest of Chris Tucker's career. You know that the film is low-budget, but F. Gary Gary's experience as video director shows here with his ability to tell a story on a small budget. The pace of the movie is flawless, as we me from one funny incident to the next. All the elements of the subplots get intertwined together for the climax of the film. It's executed brilliantly. I have this movie in my DVD collect and have seen it at least two dozen times. I know all the words to the dialogue by heart. It's just that good! The two sequels to this film, "Next Friday" and "Friday After Next" were bigger box office hits, but they also had bigger budgets. Still, these two pale in comparison to the original when it comes to great movie making. Not even Rebecca Black can foul this "Friday".

    This movie gets better every time I watch it simply because how well it's written. The acting is great for a comedy film and the story is smoothly played out in the course of one day. Friday is one of those films that doesn't try to be obnoxiously funny every second (like Step Brothers) and because of this, it's funnier than most comedy movies that come out today. Also because it is just plain hilarious all around. The actors were chosen wisely and all do their part great. The story is interesting and funny while not being too crazy in order to generate laughs (like The Hangover Part II, which I still love anyway) There isn't much to say about this movie besides the fact that it's hilarious, quotable and overall very memorable. This is like the Pineapple Express of the 90's. So if you're looking for a funny ass movie, go find it and watch it. You wont regret it.

    OPEN LETTER: I have been watching this movie since I was 6 years old.This movie? This movie right here? I can watch this movie over and over and I still laugh. ALL my friends love it. White, Black, Asian - It's great and funny! It can be defined in one word: CLASSIC! ACTUAL REVIEW: Wanna laugh? Watch this. Classic characters, classic soundtrack , classic tale, classic LINES! It is also very relate-able. We all know a Smokey "the pothead" or a Craig "the responsible one." Even though it was made in the 90's, this movie defies generations because of that fact. It is truly underrated by A LOT of critics! IN THE END... WATCH IT! RENT IT! BUY IT! STEAL IT! (okay don't do the last one) But just watch it! I give it 9 out of 10 stars.

    Watched the movie 15 years after its release and enjoyed it to its bone. Rent it and watch it in the late afternoons of the summer kind of a movie. The characters in the movie are real funny and the actors have done a good job. Personally i feel this is one of the funniest black movie of all times.Chris's character has pulled off the movie, a smoke head getting in all sorts of trouble not as Chong but saner and much more funnier. This is one of the movies that you want to watch again and again. Ice Cube has done a great job with the script. With a serious situation on the hands of ghetto guys where one is doped and care free, and the other unlucky, find out ways to sort one problem after the other. I don't understand why Chris hasn't done more films, good actor, not bad at all. You watch this and you go to the store looking for more of Chris to find almost nothing except Rush Hour.

    Friday is one of the greatest and funniest Comedies of all time,an excellent Comedy that mixes hilarious scenes,great characters,quotable dialog and a great soundtrack. All of those combinations make Friday a Cult Classic,Comedy Classic and one of my favorite Comedies and favorite films of all time. Set in a neighborhood in South Central,Los Angeles,Friday tells the story of Craig(Ice Cube)and his weed smoking drug dealing best friend Smokey(Chris Tucker)who hangout on Craig's porch talking,getting high and dealing with various characters while getting into funny situations and showing that a lot of things can happen between Thursday and Saturday. Friday is an excellent Comedy and a Cult classic that had to be made and came out at the right time in 1995 and it was needed for South Central Los Angeles. Before Friday,the city of L.A was almost in a frozen state at the time because of the L.A Riots in 1992 and urban classics like Boyz N The Hood and Menace II Society gave movie goers dark visions of African-Americans growing in SC L.A where in those films it was always death and doom and gloom with no since of hope and at the time with the exception of the House Party films and a few others Black urban Comedies we're few and far between in the early to mid-90s. Friday took a different and much lighter approach to urban films and basically said while living in the ghetto or hood can be depressing and said,it can also be funny as well giving us one of the funniest films of all time and when you watch the film on cable,video or DVD you never turn it off. One of the many reasons that Friday is such an excellent and hilarious movie is because the situations and dialog are funny and real,because if you grew up in the ghetto you have seen characters in the film in everyday life and it will relate to viewers. The Comedy in the film works so well because the Comedy just strikes a perfect balance between hilarious character driven dialog and at times over the top Humor. The screenplay by Ice Cube and D.J Pooh is wonderful,giving the characters in the film memorable dialog and great moments that don't feel forced or fake,but feel very real and very authentic. I love movies that are set in 24 hours or movies that are set in one day and Friday is one of the best films set in one single day and like the best films set in 24 hours there is Comedy but there's also some lessons learned. While Friday is hilarious and filled with great Humor the film takes a little time to talk about some of the harsh realities of living in the hood and what happens in South Central so while Friday is a Comedy and a very funny one at that it is also morality tale as well but it's not a sad or bleak morality tale like Boyz N The Hood or Menace II Society were. Craig and Smokey are a classic duo because like most great duo's there is a funny character and there is the straight forward character that is serious and the back and forth dialog and banter between the two is classic and iconic. You can tell that Craig and Smokey genuinely care for one another and will do anything for each other and as funny as the characters are they are well developed and likable. Like Craig and Smokey we are watching and seeing the things going on in their own neighborhood which for them is a normal thing,but to most viewers is hilarious and insane. The ending of the film is a classic conclusion that is funny and intense at the same time and after you look at this film you will never look at the day Friday the same way again. The cast is excellent in their roles. Ice Cube is great and funny as Craig,with Cube playing it straight and real. Chris Tucker is hilarious and excellent in his star making performance as Smokey,with Tucker saying funny lines,talking at fast paced and having great chemistry with Cube. Nia Long is wonderful and sexy as Debbie,Craig's love interest. Tiny 'Zeus' Lister Jr. is menacing and great as Deebo,the neighborhood bully. John Witherspoon is funny as always as Mr.Jones, Jones,Craig's Father. Faizon Love(Big Worm),Anthony Johnson(Ezal),Regina King(Dana),Anna Maria Horsford(Mrs. Jones),Paula Jai Parker(Joi),Bernie Mac(Pastor Clever),DJ Pooh(Red),Yvette Wilson(Rita),Ronn Riser(Stanley),Angela Means(Felisha),Kathleen Bradley(Mrs. Parker),Tony Cox(Mr. Parker),Demetrius Navarro(Hector),Jason Bose Smith(Lil' Chris)and Vickilyn Reynolds(Joann)give fun performances as well. The direction by F.Gary Gray is simple,yet great with Gray pointing and shooting,but at the same time still moving the camera and giving the film an a great energy and pace. Great direction,Gray. The score by Frank Fitzpatrick,Simon Franglen and Chuck Wild is is great and memorable and fits with the film's tone. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs from Dr. Dre(Keep Their Heads Ringin),Ice Cube(Friday),The Isley Brothers(Trying' To See Another Day)as well as classics from Curtis Mayfield(Freddie's Dead,Little Child,Running Wild),The Temptations(The Way You Do Things You Do),James Brown(Get Up(I Feel Like Being A Sex Machine),Rose Royce(I Wanna Get Next To You),Rick James(Mary Jane)and War(Low Rider)and other great songs Excellent soundtrack. In final word,if you love Comedy films,Urban films,Stoner films,Hip-Hop,Rap or films in general, I highly suggest you see Friday,a classic Comedy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended 10/10.

    This movie gets better every time I watch it simply because how well it's written. The acting is great for a comedy film and the story is smoothly played out in the course of one day. Friday is one of those films that doesn't try to be obnoxiously funny every second (like Step Brothers) and because of this, it's funnier than most comedy movies that come out today. Also because it is just plain hilarious all around. The actors were chosen wisely and all do their part great. The story is interesting and funny while not being too crazy in order to generate laughs (like The Hangover Part II, which I still love anyway) There isn't much to say about this movie besides the fact that it's hilarious, quotable and overall very memorable. This is like the Pineapple Express of the 90's. So if you're looking for a funny ass movie, go find it and watch it. You wont regret it.

    OPEN LETTER: I have been watching this movie since I was 6 years old.This movie? This movie right here? I can watch this movie over and over and I still laugh. ALL my friends love it. White, Black, Asian - It's great and funny! It can be defined in one word: CLASSIC! ACTUAL REVIEW: Wanna laugh? Watch this. Classic characters, classic soundtrack , classic tale, classic LINES! It is also very relate-able. We all know a Smokey "the pothead" or a Craig "the responsible one." Even though it was made in the 90's, this movie defies generations because of that fact. It is truly underrated by A LOT of critics! IN THE END... WATCH IT! RENT IT! BUY IT! STEAL IT! (okay don't do the last one) But just watch it! I give it 9 out of 10 stars.

    Watched the movie 15 years after its release and enjoyed it to its bone. Rent it and watch it in the late afternoons of the summer kind of a movie. The characters in the movie are real funny and the actors have done a good job. Personally i feel this is one of the funniest black movie of all times.Chris's character has pulled off the movie, a smoke head getting in all sorts of trouble not as Chong but saner and much more funnier. This is one of the movies that you want to watch again and again. Ice Cube has done a great job with the script. With a serious situation on the hands of ghetto guys where one is doped and care free, and the other unlucky, find out ways to sort one problem after the other. I don't understand why Chris hasn't done more films, good actor, not bad at all. You watch this and you go to the store looking for more of Chris to find almost nothing except Rush Hour.

    Friday is one of the greatest and funniest Comedies of all time,an excellent Comedy that mixes hilarious scenes,great characters,quotable dialog and a great soundtrack. All of those combinations make Friday a Cult Classic,Comedy Classic and one of my favorite Comedies and favorite films of all time. Set in a neighborhood in South Central,Los Angeles,Friday tells the story of Craig(Ice Cube)and his weed smoking drug dealing best friend Smokey(Chris Tucker)who hangout on Craig's porch talking,getting high and dealing with various characters while getting into funny situations and showing that a lot of things can happen between Thursday and Saturday. Friday is an excellent Comedy and a Cult classic that had to be made and came out at the right time in 1995 and it was needed for South Central Los Angeles. Before Friday,the city of L.A was almost in a frozen state at the time because of the L.A Riots in 1992 and urban classics like Boyz N The Hood and Menace II Society gave movie goers dark visions of African-Americans growing in SC L.A where in those films it was always death and doom and gloom with no since of hope and at the time with the exception of the House Party films and a few others Black urban Comedies we're few and far between in the early to mid-90s. Friday took a different and much lighter approach to urban films and basically said while living in the ghetto or hood can be depressing and said,it can also be funny as well giving us one of the funniest films of all time and when you watch the film on cable,video or DVD you never turn it off. One of the many reasons that Friday is such an excellent and hilarious movie is because the situations and dialog are funny and real,because if you grew up in the ghetto you have seen characters in the film in everyday life and it will relate to viewers. The Comedy in the film works so well because the Comedy just strikes a perfect balance between hilarious character driven dialog and at times over the top Humor. The screenplay by Ice Cube and D.J Pooh is wonderful,giving the characters in the film memorable dialog and great moments that don't feel forced or fake,but feel very real and very authentic. I love movies that are set in 24 hours or movies that are set in one day and Friday is one of the best films set in one single day and like the best films set in 24 hours there is Comedy but there's also some lessons learned. While Friday is hilarious and filled with great Humor the film takes a little time to talk about some of the harsh realities of living in the hood and what happens in South Central so while Friday is a Comedy and a very funny one at that it is also morality tale as well but it's not a sad or bleak morality tale like Boyz N The Hood or Menace II Society were. Craig and Smokey are a classic duo because like most great duo's there is a funny character and there is the straight forward character that is serious and the back and forth dialog and banter between the two is classic and iconic. You can tell that Craig and Smokey genuinely care for one another and will do anything for each other and as funny as the characters are they are well developed and likable. Like Craig and Smokey we are watching and seeing the things going on in their own neighborhood which for them is a normal thing,but to most viewers is hilarious and insane. The ending of the film is a classic conclusion that is funny and intense at the same time and after you look at this film you will never look at the day Friday the same way again. The cast is excellent in their roles. Ice Cube is great and funny as Craig,with Cube playing it straight and real. Chris Tucker is hilarious and excellent in his star making performance as Smokey,with Tucker saying funny lines,talking at fast paced and having great chemistry with Cube. Nia Long is wonderful and sexy as Debbie,Craig's love interest. Tiny 'Zeus' Lister Jr. is menacing and great as Deebo,the neighborhood bully. John Witherspoon is funny as always as Mr.Jones, Jones,Craig's Father. Faizon Love(Big Worm),Anthony Johnson(Ezal),Regina King(Dana),Anna Maria Horsford(Mrs. Jones),Paula Jai Parker(Joi),Bernie Mac(Pastor Clever),DJ Pooh(Red),Yvette Wilson(Rita),Ronn Riser(Stanley),Angela Means(Felisha),Kathleen Bradley(Mrs. Parker),Tony Cox(Mr. Parker),Demetrius Navarro(Hector),Jason Bose Smith(Lil' Chris)and Vickilyn Reynolds(Joann)give fun performances as well. The direction by F.Gary Gray is simple,yet great with Gray pointing and shooting,but at the same time still moving the camera and giving the film an a great energy and pace. Great direction,Gray. The score by Frank Fitzpatrick,Simon Franglen and Chuck Wild is is great and memorable and fits with the film's tone. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs from Dr. Dre(Keep Their Heads Ringin),Ice Cube(Friday),The Isley Brothers(Trying' To See Another Day)as well as classics from Curtis Mayfield(Freddie's Dead,Little Child,Running Wild),The Temptations(The Way You Do Things You Do),James Brown(Get Up(I Feel Like Being A Sex Machine),Rose Royce(I Wanna Get Next To You),Rick James(Mary Jane)and War(Low Rider)and other great songs Excellent soundtrack. In final word,if you love Comedy films,Urban films,Stoner films,Hip-Hop,Rap or films in general, I highly suggest you see Friday,a classic Comedy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended 10/10.

    My feelings towards the movie "Friday" is excitement. The film's quality and enjoyment level is high. It's not quite a family movie but it has adult fun in it. The film, which stars a cast of great African American actors such as Ice Cube, Chris Tucker, John Witherspoon and Bernie Mac, was directed by Gary Gray. A young man who just lost his job gets the help of his best friend to make a quick buck. But this experience is not what either of them expected to go through. They are hassled, hustled, chased, robbed and beat up but still stuck together. The comedy level in this film is through the roof. A true classic movie at its best, the lessons taught in the movie are also good. Ice Cube, who played Craig, was the main actor. His portrayal of a young man who just lost his job and has the pressure of his family on his back was great. Craig's friend in the movie was Smokey, Co-starred by Chris Tucker. His role was to be the joke telling, crazy, loose cannon friend we all have. The films use of small side stories and background stories into the key actor's lives was an eye opener for the viewer. It gave the plot depth and stability. The music choices weren't that important into the story, there really wasn't a soundtrack to the film. Even though this was a comedy, the few serious or important moments were enhanced so that the viewer would sense the importance of that scene. I personal recommend this movie to all who likes adult comedy. This film is a classic and its sequels even deserve a chance. Also the turn at the end is one to remember. My overall feeling towards this movie is a great two thumbs up.

    I'm going to keep this short and sweet, enough people have already gave the rundown of characters, summary and their thoughts on movie. But I felt i needed to write this due to Critics speaking so badly about this Classic Movie. This movie is amazing and there's nothing else to possibly say. I give it 100/100 and I prefer watching it if you haven't already. I have seen this movie over 50+ times and it never gets old to me. Well all i have to say and I'm pretty sure others will agree. Chris Tucker played a excellent role in the movie and with Ice Cube in it it just made the movie that much better. I love this movie and honestly I think this is the ONLY Friday that I like. This was simple, funny and just always entertaining to watch.

    This is one of the few good comedies to ever come out of the 90's. The film is about Craig played by Ice Cube and his buddy Smokey played by Chris Tucker who are faced with the dilemma of paying Smokey's boss $200 by the end of the day or they are dead. And that's just about it. While this film is simple I enjoyed and laughed frequently. The neighborhood has a lot of colorful Characters and Chris Tucker steals the whole show. Sorry this one is short but There is just not a lot to write about this film. Rated R For Pervasive Strong Language And Drug Use, And For A Brutal Fight. Theatrical Cut: 1hr 31min/91min. Director's Cut: 1hr 37min/97min. 85 uses of the F-word. ****/****

    One of the funniest/greatest films ever made, i mean this was Ice Cubes first written movie. I read on the internet that John Singleton told Ice Cube if he can write music he can write movies and ice Cube did a Fantastic JOB. Ice Cube wrote a classic. out of all the movies i watched Friday is the most watched.I have a VCR/DVD thing and on weekday nights i put Friday in or even on the weekends, and i just laugh. Smokey got Craig high and they just had fun on a Friday. Directed by DJ pooh/written by Ice Cube. This movie is a 10/10

    1995's "Friday" is one of the best comedies to feature an entirely black cast of actors from the '90s. "Friday" has been a long-time personal favorite of mine since about 1999 - four years after this film's original 1995 theatrical release and just one year before the release of its sequel "Next Friday" (2000). Following in the footsteps of neo-blaxploitation 'hood movies from the early '90s, "Friday" is somewhat of a parody of films such as "Boyz N the Hood" (1991) and "Menace II Society" (1993), but with a Cheech & Chong-styled, urban stoner twist. It comes in between the seriousness of "Boyz" and "Menace" (but before the 'hood-movie silliness of 1996's "Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood") and the PC 21st-century preachiness of Tyler Perry. But that doesn't mean that "Friday" still isn't saying SOMETHING meaningful. In its own unique, un-preachy way, "Friday" critiques the (still-relevant) epidemic of unemployment in the black community while also throwing wickedly pointed barbs at U.S. drug laws (particularly as they pertain to marijuana). A Lot Can And Does Go Down Between Thursday And Saturday in "Friday," which marked the big-screen debut of former music video director F. Gary Gray. On one particularly eventful Friday in South Central Los Angeles, recently unemployed Craig Jones (rapper Ice Cube) wakes up with no job, nowhere to go, and nothing to do. The plot is pretty thin as he and best bud Smokey (hilarious Chris Tucker) observe the goings-on in their neighborhood and all of the film's colorful cast of neighborhood characters. Things get really going when Smokey suddenly becomes indebted to local drug dealer Big Worm (Faizon Love) for $200 after smoking up the same merchandise that he was supposed to be selling, which also leads to a violent ending confrontation with towering neighborhood bully Deebo (Tiny "Zeus" Lister, Jr.). "Friday" really does breeze through its plot and characters and does so with a funny, laugh-a-minute script penned by none other than Ice Cube himself and co-screenwriter DJ Pooh (who also appears in the film as Craig's co-worker Red). Chris Tucker's Smokey seems to get the best laughs and one-liners here. With his nasal, high-pitched voice and manic mannerisms, he proves to be a reliable comic foil to Ice Cube's more level-headed Everyman Craig and is the film's comedic centerpiece. John Witherspoon brings a seasoned maturity to his role as Craig's Dad, a hilarious cameo by the late Bernic Mac as Pastor Clever is perfectly timed, and Nia Long livens up any scene she appears as the girl next door Debbie. Since F. Gary Gray is a former music video director making his big debut here, the movie does also have a wonderful hip-hop/'70s soul soundtrack that features Ice Cube himself, Dr. Dre (still riding high at the time on the popularity of his trademarked "G"-funk sound), Cypress Hill, Scarface (of Geto Boys), Mack 10 and 2 Live Crew, plus old-school funk/R & B talents such as the late Rick James, Bootsy Collins & Bernie Worrell, and The Isley Brothers. Such a selection of artists proves he knows his black music very well. 10/10

    Proof positive that you don't need a big budget and special effects to make a great movie. "Friday" is all about comedy, the characters, and great storytelling. This movie is a classic comedy that stars Ice Cube, John Witherspoon, Nia Long, the late Bernie Mac, Regina King, Anna Maria Horsford and Chris Tucker in his breakthrough role as Smokie. It follows a day (Friday) in the life of Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and his best friend Smokie, who in my opinion, steals the show. This is the movie that would define the rest of Chris Tucker's career. You know that the film is low-budget, but F. Gary Gary's experience as video director shows here with his ability to tell a story on a small budget. The pace of the movie is flawless, as we me from one funny incident to the next. All the elements of the subplots get intertwined together for the climax of the film. It's executed brilliantly. I have this movie in my DVD collect and have seen it at least two dozen times. I know all the words to the dialogue by heart. It's just that good! The two sequels to this film, "Next Friday" and "Friday After Next" were bigger box office hits, but they also had bigger budgets. Still, these two pale in comparison to the original when it comes to great movie making. Not even Rebecca Black can foul this "Friday".

Sorry this one is short but There is just not a lot to write about this film. Rated R For Pervasive Strong Language And Drug Use, And For A Brutal Fight. Theatrical Cut: 1hr 31min/91min. Director's Cut: 1hr 37min/97min. 85 uses of the F-word. ****/****

    One of the funniest/greatest films ever made, i mean this was Ice Cubes first written movie. I read on the internet that John Singleton told Ice Cube if he can write music he can write movies and ice Cube did a Fantastic JOB. Ice Cube wrote a classic. out of all the movies i watched Friday is the most watched.I have a VCR/DVD thing and on weekday nights i put Friday in or even on the weekends, and i just laugh. Smokey got Craig high and they just had fun on a Friday. Directed by DJ pooh/written by Ice Cube. This movie is a 10/10

    1995's "Friday" is one of the best comedies to feature an entirely black cast of actors from the '90s. "Friday" has been a long-time personal favorite of mine since about 1999 - four years after this film's original 1995 theatrical release and just one year before the release of its sequel "Next Friday" (2000). Following in the footsteps of neo-blaxploitation 'hood movies from the early '90s, "Friday" is somewhat of a parody of films such as "Boyz N the Hood" (1991) and "Menace II Society" (1993), but with a Cheech & Chong-styled, urban stoner twist. It comes in between the seriousness of "Boyz" and "Menace" (but before the 'hood-movie silliness of 1996's "Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood") and the PC 21st-century preachiness of Tyler Perry. But that doesn't mean that "Friday" still isn't saying SOMETHING meaningful. In its own unique, un-preachy way, "Friday" critiques the (still-relevant) epidemic of unemployment in the black community while also throwing wickedly pointed barbs at U.S. drug laws (particularly as they pertain to marijuana). A Lot Can And Does Go Down Between Thursday And Saturday in "Friday," which marked the big-screen debut of former music video director F. Gary Gray. On one particularly eventful Friday in South Central Los Angeles, recently unemployed Craig Jones (rapper Ice Cube) wakes up with no job, nowhere to go, and nothing to do. The plot is pretty thin as he and best bud Smokey (hilarious Chris Tucker) observe the goings-on in their neighborhood and all of the film's colorful cast of neighborhood characters. Things get really going when Smokey suddenly becomes indebted to local drug dealer Big Worm (Faizon Love) for $200 after smoking up the same merchandise that he was supposed to be selling, which also leads to a violent ending confrontation with towering neighborhood bully Deebo (Tiny "Zeus" Lister, Jr.). "Friday" really does breeze through its plot and characters and does so with a funny, laugh-a-minute script penned by none other than Ice Cube himself and co-screenwriter DJ Pooh (who also appears in the film as Craig's co-worker Red). Chris Tucker's Smokey seems to get the best laughs and one-liners here. With his nasal, high-pitched voice and manic mannerisms, he proves to be a reliable comic foil to Ice Cube's more level-headed Everyman Craig and is the film's comedic centerpiece. John Witherspoon brings a seasoned maturity to his role as Craig's Dad, a hilarious cameo by the late Bernic Mac as Pastor Clever is perfectly timed, and Nia Long livens up any scene she appears as the girl next door Debbie. Since F. Gary Gray is a former music video director making his big debut here, the movie does also have a wonderful hip-hop/'70s soul soundtrack that features Ice Cube himself, Dr. Dre (still riding high at the time on the popularity of his trademarked "G"-funk sound), Cypress Hill, Scarface (of Geto Boys), Mack 10 and 2 Live Crew, plus old-school funk/R & B talents such as the late Rick James, Bootsy Collins & Bernie Worrell, and The Isley Brothers. Such a selection of artists proves he knows his black music very well. 10/10

    Proof positive that you don't need a big budget and special effects to make a great movie. "Friday" is all about comedy, the characters, and great storytelling. This movie is a classic comedy that stars Ice Cube, John Witherspoon, Nia Long, the late Bernie Mac, Regina King, Anna Maria Horsford and Chris Tucker in his breakthrough role as Smokie. It follows a day (Friday) in the life of Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and his best friend Smokie, who in my opinion, steals the show. This is the movie that would define the rest of Chris Tucker's career. You know that the film is low-budget, but F. Gary Gary's experience as video director shows here with his ability to tell a story on a small budget. The pace of the movie is flawless, as we me from one funny incident to the next. All the elements of the subplots get intertwined together for the climax of the film. It's executed brilliantly. I have this movie in my DVD collect and have seen it at least two dozen times. I know all the words to the dialogue by heart. It's just that good! The two sequels to this film, "Next Friday" and "Friday After Next" were bigger box office hits, but they also had bigger budgets. Still, these two pale in comparison to the original when it comes to great movie making. Not even Rebecca Black can foul this "Friday".

    This movie gets better every time I watch it simply because how well it's written. The acting is great for a comedy film and the story is smoothly played out in the course of one day. Friday is one of those films that doesn't try to be obnoxiously funny every second (like Step Brothers) and because of this, it's funnier than most comedy movies that come out today. Also because it is just plain hilarious all around. The actors were chosen wisely and all do their part great. The story is interesting and funny while not being too crazy in order to generate laughs (like The Hangover Part II, which I still love anyway) There isn't much to say about this movie besides the fact that it's hilarious, quotable and overall very memorable. This is like the Pineapple Express of the 90's. So if you're looking for a funny ass movie, go find it and watch it. You wont regret it.

White, Black, Asian - It's great and funny! It can be defined in one word: CLASSIC! ACTUAL REVIEW: Wanna laugh? Watch this. Classic characters, classic soundtrack , classic tale, classic LINES! It is also very relate-able. We all know a Smokey "the pothead" or a Craig "the responsible one." Even though it was made in the 90's, this movie defies generations because of that fact. It is truly underrated by A LOT of critics! IN THE END... WATCH IT! RENT IT! BUY IT! STEAL IT! (okay don't do the last one) But just watch it! I give it 9 out of 10 stars.

    Watched the movie 15 years after its release and enjoyed it to its bone. Rent it and watch it in the late afternoons of the summer kind of a movie. The characters in the movie are real funny and the actors have done a good job. Personally i feel this is one of the funniest black movie of all times.Chris's character has pulled off the movie, a smoke head getting in all sorts of trouble not as Chong but saner and much more funnier. This is one of the movies that you want to watch again and again. Ice Cube has done a great job with the script. With a serious situation on the hands of ghetto guys where one is doped and care free, and the other unlucky, find out ways to sort one problem after the other. I don't understand why Chris hasn't done more films, good actor, not bad at all. You watch this and you go to the store looking for more of Chris to find almost nothing except Rush Hour.

    Friday is one of the greatest and funniest Comedies of all time,an excellent Comedy that mixes hilarious scenes,great characters,quotable dialog and a great soundtrack. All of those combinations make Friday a Cult Classic,Comedy Classic and one of my favorite Comedies and favorite films of all time. Set in a neighborhood in South Central,Los Angeles,Friday tells the story of Craig(Ice Cube)and his weed smoking drug dealing best friend Smokey(Chris Tucker)who hangout on Craig's porch talking,getting high and dealing with various characters while getting into funny situations and showing that a lot of things can happen between Thursday and Saturday. Friday is an excellent Comedy and a Cult classic that had to be made and came out at the right time in 1995 and it was needed for South Central Los Angeles. Before Friday,the city of L.A was almost in a frozen state at the time because of the L.A Riots in 1992 and urban classics like Boyz N The Hood and Menace II Society gave movie goers dark visions of African-Americans growing in SC L.A where in those films it was always death and doom and gloom with no since of hope and at the time with the exception of the House Party films and a few others Black urban Comedies we're few and far between in the early to mid-90s. Friday took a different and much lighter approach to urban films and basically said while living in the ghetto or hood can be depressing and said,it can also be funny as well giving us one of the funniest films of all time and when you watch the film on cable,video or DVD you never turn it off. One of the many reasons that Friday is such an excellent and hilarious movie is because the situations and dialog are funny and real,because if you grew up in the ghetto you have seen characters in the film in everyday life and it will relate to viewers. The Comedy in the film works so well because the Comedy just strikes a perfect balance between hilarious character driven dialog and at times over the top Humor. The screenplay by Ice Cube and D.J Pooh is wonderful,giving the characters in the film memorable dialog and great moments that don't feel forced or fake,but feel very real and very authentic. I love movies that are set in 24 hours or movies that are set in one day and Friday is one of the best films set in one single day and like the best films set in 24 hours there is Comedy but there's also some lessons learned. While Friday is hilarious and filled with great Humor the film takes a little time to talk about some of the harsh realities of living in the hood and what happens in South Central so while Friday is a Comedy and a very funny one at that it is also morality tale as well but it's not a sad or bleak morality tale like Boyz N The Hood or Menace II Society were. Craig and Smokey are a classic duo because like most great duo's there is a funny character and there is the straight forward character that is serious and the back and forth dialog and banter between the two is classic and iconic. You can tell that Craig and Smokey genuinely care for one another and will do anything for each other and as funny as the characters are they are well developed and likable. Like Craig and Smokey we are watching and seeing the things going on in their own neighborhood which for them is a normal thing,but to most viewers is hilarious and insane. The ending of the film is a classic conclusion that is funny and intense at the same time and after you look at this film you will never look at the day Friday the same way again. The cast is excellent in their roles. Ice Cube is great and funny as Craig,with Cube playing it straight and real. Chris Tucker is hilarious and excellent in his star making performance as Smokey,with Tucker saying funny lines,talking at fast paced and having great chemistry with Cube. Nia Long is wonderful and sexy as Debbie,Craig's love interest. Tiny 'Zeus' Lister Jr. is menacing and great as Deebo,the neighborhood bully. John Witherspoon is funny as always as Mr.Jones, Jones,Craig's Father. Faizon Love(Big Worm),Anthony Johnson(Ezal),Regina King(Dana),Anna Maria Horsford(Mrs. Jones),Paula Jai Parker(Joi),Bernie Mac(Pastor Clever),DJ Pooh(Red),Yvette Wilson(Rita),Ronn Riser(Stanley),Angela Means(Felisha),Kathleen Bradley(Mrs. Parker),Tony Cox(Mr. Parker),Demetrius Navarro(Hector),Jason Bose Smith(Lil' Chris)and Vickilyn Reynolds(Joann)give fun performances as well. The direction by F.Gary Gray is simple,yet great with Gray pointing and shooting,but at the same time still moving the camera and giving the film an a great energy and pace. Great direction,Gray. The score by Frank Fitzpatrick,Simon Franglen and Chuck Wild is is great and memorable and fits with the film's tone. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs from Dr. Dre(Keep Their Heads Ringin),Ice Cube(Friday),The Isley Brothers(Trying' To See Another Day)as well as classics from Curtis Mayfield(Freddie's Dead,Little Child,Running Wild),The Temptations(The Way You Do Things You Do),James Brown(Get Up(I Feel Like Being A Sex Machine),Rose Royce(I Wanna Get Next To You),Rick James(Mary Jane)and War(Low Rider)and other great songs Excellent soundtrack. In final word,if you love Comedy films,Urban films,Stoner films,Hip-Hop,Rap or films in general, I highly suggest you see Friday,a classic Comedy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended 10/10.

    My feelings towards the movie "Friday" is excitement. The film's quality and enjoyment level is high. It's not quite a family movie but it has adult fun in it. The film, which stars a cast of great African American actors such as Ice Cube, Chris Tucker, John Witherspoon and Bernie Mac, was directed by Gary Gray. A young man who just lost his job gets the help of his best friend to make a quick buck. But this experience is not what either of them expected to go through. They are hassled, hustled, chased, robbed and beat up but still stuck together. The comedy level in this film is through the roof. A true classic movie at its best, the lessons taught in the movie are also good. Ice Cube, who played Craig, was the main actor. His portrayal of a young man who just lost his job and has the pressure of his family on his back was great. Craig's friend in the movie was Smokey, Co-starred by Chris Tucker. His role was to be the joke telling, crazy, loose cannon friend we all have. The films use of small side stories and background stories into the key actor's lives was an eye opener for the viewer. It gave the plot depth and stability. The music choices weren't that important into the story, there really wasn't a soundtrack to the film. Even though this was a comedy, the few serious or important moments were enhanced so that the viewer would sense the importance of that scene. I personal recommend this movie to all who likes adult comedy. This film is a classic and its sequels even deserve a chance. Also the turn at the end is one to remember. My overall feeling towards this movie is a great two thumbs up.

    I'm going to keep this short and sweet, enough people have already gave the rundown of characters, summary and their thoughts on movie. But I felt i needed to write this due to Critics speaking so badly about this Classic Movie. This movie is amazing and there's nothing else to possibly say. I give it 100/100 and I prefer watching it if you haven't already. I have seen this movie over 50+ times and it never gets old to me. Well all i have to say and I'm pretty sure others will agree. Chris Tucker played a excellent role in the movie and with Ice Cube in it it just made the movie that much better. I love this movie and honestly I think this is the ONLY Friday that I like. This was simple, funny and just always entertaining to watch.

The Comedy in the film works so well because the Comedy just strikes a perfect balance between hilarious character driven dialog and at times over the top Humor. The screenplay by Ice Cube and D.J Pooh is wonderful,giving the characters in the film memorable dialog and great moments that don't feel forced or fake,but feel very real and very authentic. I love movies that are set in 24 hours or movies that are set in one day and Friday is one of the best films set in one single day and like the best films set in 24 hours there is Comedy but there's also some lessons learned. While Friday is hilarious and filled with great Humor the film takes a little time to talk about some of the harsh realities of living in the hood and what happens in South Central so while Friday is a Comedy and a very funny one at that it is also morality tale as well but it's not a sad or bleak morality tale like Boyz N The Hood or Menace II Society were. Craig and Smokey are a classic duo because like most great duo's there is a funny character and there is the straight forward character that is serious and the back and forth dialog and banter between the two is classic and iconic. You can tell that Craig and Smokey genuinely care for one another and will do anything for each other and as funny as the characters are they are well developed and likable. Like Craig and Smokey we are watching and seeing the things going on in their own neighborhood which for them is a normal thing,but to most viewers is hilarious and insane. The ending of the film is a classic conclusion that is funny and intense at the same time and after you look at this film you will never look at the day Friday the same way again. The cast is excellent in their roles. Ice Cube is great and funny as Craig,with Cube playing it straight and real. Chris Tucker is hilarious and excellent in his star making performance as Smokey,with Tucker saying funny lines,talking at fast paced and having great chemistry with Cube. Nia Long is wonderful and sexy as Debbie,Craig's love interest. Tiny 'Zeus' Lister Jr. is menacing and great as Deebo,the neighborhood bully. John Witherspoon is funny as always as Mr.Jones, Jones,Craig's Father. Faizon Love(Big Worm),Anthony Johnson(Ezal),Regina King(Dana),Anna Maria Horsford(Mrs. Jones),Paula Jai Parker(Joi),Bernie Mac(Pastor Clever),DJ Pooh(Red),Yvette Wilson(Rita),Ronn Riser(Stanley),Angela Means(Felisha),Kathleen Bradley(Mrs. Parker),Tony Cox(Mr. Parker),Demetrius Navarro(Hector),Jason Bose Smith(Lil' Chris)and Vickilyn Reynolds(Joann)give fun performances as well. The direction by F.Gary Gray is simple,yet great with Gray pointing and shooting,but at the same time still moving the camera and giving the film an a great energy and pace. Great direction,Gray. The score by Frank Fitzpatrick,Simon Franglen and Chuck Wild is is great and memorable and fits with the film's tone. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs from Dr. Dre(Keep Their Heads Ringin),Ice Cube(Friday),The Isley Brothers(Trying' To See Another Day)as well as classics from Curtis Mayfield(Freddie's Dead,Little Child,Running Wild),The Temptations(The Way You Do Things You Do),James Brown(Get Up(I Feel Like Being A Sex Machine),Rose Royce(I Wanna Get Next To You),Rick James(Mary Jane)and War(Low Rider)and other great songs Excellent soundtrack. In final word,if you love Comedy films,Urban films,Stoner films,Hip-Hop,Rap or films in general, I highly suggest you see Friday,a classic Comedy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended 10/10.

    My feelings towards the movie "Friday" is excitement. The film's quality and enjoyment level is high. It's not quite a family movie but it has adult fun in it. The film, which stars a cast of great African American actors such as Ice Cube, Chris Tucker, John Witherspoon and Bernie Mac, was directed by Gary Gray. A young man who just lost his job gets the help of his best friend to make a quick buck. But this experience is not what either of them expected to go through. They are hassled, hustled, chased, robbed and beat up but still stuck together. The comedy level in this film is through the roof. A true classic movie at its best, the lessons taught in the movie are also good. Ice Cube, who played Craig, was the main actor. His portrayal of a young man who just lost his job and has the pressure of his family on his back was great. Craig's friend in the movie was Smokey, Co-starred by Chris Tucker. His role was to be the joke telling, crazy, loose cannon friend we all have. The films use of small side stories and background stories into the key actor's lives was an eye opener for the viewer. It gave the plot depth and stability. The music choices weren't that important into the story, there really wasn't a soundtrack to the film. Even though this was a comedy, the few serious or important moments were enhanced so that the viewer would sense the importance of that scene. I personal recommend this movie to all who likes adult comedy. This film is a classic and its sequels even deserve a chance. Also the turn at the end is one to remember. My overall feeling towards this movie is a great two thumbs up.

    I'm going to keep this short and sweet, enough people have already gave the rundown of characters, summary and their thoughts on movie. But I felt i needed to write this due to Critics speaking so badly about this Classic Movie. This movie is amazing and there's nothing else to possibly say. I give it 100/100 and I prefer watching it if you haven't already. I have seen this movie over 50+ times and it never gets old to me. Well all i have to say and I'm pretty sure others will agree. Chris Tucker played a excellent role in the movie and with Ice Cube in it it just made the movie that much better. I love this movie and honestly I think this is the ONLY Friday that I like. This was simple, funny and just always entertaining to watch.

    This is one of the few good comedies to ever come out of the 90's. The film is about Craig played by Ice Cube and his buddy Smokey played by Chris Tucker who are faced with the dilemma of paying Smokey's boss $200 by the end of the day or they are dead. And that's just about it. While this film is simple I enjoyed and laughed frequently. The neighborhood has a lot of colorful Characters and Chris Tucker steals the whole show. Sorry this one is short but There is just not a lot to write about this film. Rated R For Pervasive Strong Language And Drug Use, And For A Brutal Fight. Theatrical Cut: 1hr 31min/91min. Director's Cut: 1hr 37min/97min. 85 uses of the F-word. ****/****

    1995's "Friday" is one of the best comedies to feature an entirely black cast of actors from the '90s. "Friday" has been a long-time personal favorite of mine since about 1999 - four years after this film's original 1995 theatrical release and just one year before the release of its sequel "Next Friday" (2000). Following in the footsteps of neo-blaxploitation 'hood movies from the early '90s, "Friday" is somewhat of a parody of films such as "Boyz N the Hood" (1991) and "Menace II Society" (1993), but with a Cheech & Chong-styled, urban stoner twist. It comes in between the seriousness of "Boyz" and "Menace" (but before the 'hood-movie silliness of 1996's "Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood") and the PC 21st-century preachiness of Tyler Perry. But that doesn't mean that "Friday" still isn't saying SOMETHING meaningful. In its own unique, un-preachy way, "Friday" critiques the (still-relevant) epidemic of unemployment in the black community while also throwing wickedly pointed barbs at U.S. drug laws (particularly as they pertain to marijuana). A Lot Can And Does Go Down Between Thursday And Saturday in "Friday," which marked the big-screen debut of former music video director F. Gary Gray. On one particularly eventful Friday in South Central Los Angeles, recently unemployed Craig Jones (rapper Ice Cube) wakes up with no job, nowhere to go, and nothing to do. The plot is pretty thin as he and best bud Smokey (hilarious Chris Tucker) observe the goings-on in their neighborhood and all of the film's colorful cast of neighborhood characters. Things get really going when Smokey suddenly becomes indebted to local drug dealer Big Worm (Faizon Love) for $200 after smoking up the same merchandise that he was supposed to be selling, which also leads to a violent ending confrontation with towering neighborhood bully Deebo (Tiny "Zeus" Lister, Jr.). "Friday" really does breeze through its plot and characters and does so with a funny, laugh-a-minute script penned by none other than Ice Cube himself and co-screenwriter DJ Pooh (who also appears in the film as Craig's co-worker Red). Chris Tucker's Smokey seems to get the best laughs and one-liners here. With his nasal, high-pitched voice and manic mannerisms, he proves to be a reliable comic foil to Ice Cube's more level-headed Everyman Craig and is the film's comedic centerpiece. John Witherspoon brings a seasoned maturity to his role as Craig's Dad, a hilarious cameo by the late Bernic Mac as Pastor Clever is perfectly timed, and Nia Long livens up any scene she appears as the girl next door Debbie. Since F. Gary Gray is a former music video director making his big debut here, the movie does also have a wonderful hip-hop/'70s soul soundtrack that features Ice Cube himself, Dr. Dre (still riding high at the time on the popularity of his trademarked "G"-funk sound), Cypress Hill, Scarface (of Geto Boys), Mack 10 and 2 Live Crew, plus old-school funk/R & B talents such as the late Rick James, Bootsy Collins & Bernie Worrell, and The Isley Brothers. Such a selection of artists proves he knows his black music very well. 10/10

    Proof positive that you don't need a big budget and special effects to make a great movie. "Friday" is all about comedy, the characters, and great storytelling. This movie is a classic comedy that stars Ice Cube, John Witherspoon, Nia Long, the late Bernie Mac, Regina King, Anna Maria Horsford and Chris Tucker in his breakthrough role as Smokie. It follows a day (Friday) in the life of Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and his best friend Smokie, who in my opinion, steals the show. This is the movie that would define the rest of Chris Tucker's career. You know that the film is low-budget, but F. Gary Gary's experience as video director shows here with his ability to tell a story on a small budget. The pace of the movie is flawless, as we me from one funny incident to the next. All the elements of the subplots get intertwined together for the climax of the film. It's executed brilliantly. I have this movie in my DVD collect and have seen it at least two dozen times. I know all the words to the dialogue by heart. It's just that good! The two sequels to this film, "Next Friday" and "Friday After Next" were bigger box office hits, but they also had bigger budgets. Still, these two pale in comparison to the original when it comes to great movie making. Not even Rebecca Black can foul this "Friday".

    This movie gets better every time I watch it simply because how well it's written. The acting is great for a comedy film and the story is smoothly played out in the course of one day. Friday is one of those films that doesn't try to be obnoxiously funny every second (like Step Brothers) and because of this, it's funnier than most comedy movies that come out today. Also because it is just plain hilarious all around. The actors were chosen wisely and all do their part great. The story is interesting and funny while not being too crazy in order to generate laughs (like The Hangover Part II, which I still love anyway) There isn't much to say about this movie besides the fact that it's hilarious, quotable and overall very memorable. This is like the Pineapple Express of the 90's. So if you're looking for a funny ass movie, go find it and watch it. You wont regret it.

    OPEN LETTER: I have been watching this movie since I was 6 years old.This movie? This movie right here? I can watch this movie over and over and I still laugh. ALL my friends love it. White, Black, Asian - It's great and funny! It can be defined in one word: CLASSIC! ACTUAL REVIEW: Wanna laugh? Watch this. Classic characters, classic soundtrack , classic tale, classic LINES! It is also very relate-able. We all know a Smokey "the pothead" or a Craig "the responsible one." Even though it was made in the 90's, this movie defies generations because of that fact. It is truly underrated by A LOT of critics! IN THE END... WATCH IT! RENT IT! BUY IT! STEAL IT! (okay don't do the last one) But just watch it! I give it 9 out of 10 stars.

    Watched the movie 15 years after its release and enjoyed it to its bone. Rent it and watch it in the late afternoons of the summer kind of a movie. The characters in the movie are real funny and the actors have done a good job. Personally i feel this is one of the funniest black movie of all times.Chris's character has pulled off the movie, a smoke head getting in all sorts of trouble not as Chong but saner and much more funnier. This is one of the movies that you want to watch again and again. Ice Cube has done a great job with the script. With a serious situation on the hands of ghetto guys where one is doped and care free, and the other unlucky, find out ways to sort one problem after the other. I don't understand why Chris hasn't done more films, good actor, not bad at all. You watch this and you go to the store looking for more of Chris to find almost nothing except Rush Hour.

    Friday is one of the greatest and funniest Comedies of all time,an excellent Comedy that mixes hilarious scenes,great characters,quotable dialog and a great soundtrack. All of those combinations make Friday a Cult Classic,Comedy Classic and one of my favorite Comedies and favorite films of all time. Set in a neighborhood in South Central,Los Angeles,Friday tells the story of Craig(Ice Cube)and his weed smoking drug dealing best friend Smokey(Chris Tucker)who hangout on Craig's porch talking,getting high and dealing with various characters while getting into funny situations and showing that a lot of things can happen between Thursday and Saturday. Friday is an excellent Comedy and a Cult classic that had to be made and came out at the right time in 1995 and it was needed for South Central Los Angeles. Before Friday,the city of L.A was almost in a frozen state at the time because of the L.A Riots in 1992 and urban classics like Boyz N The Hood and Menace II Society gave movie goers dark visions of African-Americans growing in SC L.A where in those films it was always death and doom and gloom with no since of hope and at the time with the exception of the House Party films and a few others Black urban Comedies we're few and far between in the early to mid-90s. Friday took a different and much lighter approach to urban films and basically said while living in the ghetto or hood can be depressing and said,it can also be funny as well giving us one of the funniest films of all time and when you watch the film on cable,video or DVD you never turn it off. One of the many reasons that Friday is such an excellent and hilarious movie is because the situations and dialog are funny and real,because if you grew up in the ghetto you have seen characters in the film in everyday life and it will relate to viewers. The Comedy in the film works so well because the Comedy just strikes a perfect balance between hilarious character driven dialog and at times over the top Humor. The screenplay by Ice Cube and D.J Pooh is wonderful,giving the characters in the film memorable dialog and great moments that don't feel forced or fake,but feel very real and very authentic. I love movies that are set in 24 hours or movies that are set in one day and Friday is one of the best films set in one single day and like the best films set in 24 hours there is Comedy but there's also some lessons learned. While Friday is hilarious and filled with great Humor the film takes a little time to talk about some of the harsh realities of living in the hood and what happens in South Central so while Friday is a Comedy and a very funny one at that it is also morality tale as well but it's not a sad or bleak morality tale like Boyz N The Hood or Menace II Society were. Craig and Smokey are a classic duo because like most great duo's there is a funny character and there is the straight forward character that is serious and the back and forth dialog and banter between the two is classic and iconic.

The cast is excellent in their roles. Ice Cube is great and funny as Craig,with Cube playing it straight and real. Chris Tucker is hilarious and excellent in his star making performance as Smokey,with Tucker saying funny lines,talking at fast paced and having great chemistry with Cube. Nia Long is wonderful and sexy as Debbie,Craig's love interest. Tiny 'Zeus' Lister Jr. is menacing and great as Deebo,the neighborhood bully. John Witherspoon is funny as always as Mr.Jones, Jones,Craig's Father. Faizon Love(Big Worm),Anthony Johnson(Ezal),Regina King(Dana),Anna Maria Horsford(Mrs. Jones),Paula Jai Parker(Joi),Bernie Mac(Pastor Clever),DJ Pooh(Red),Yvette Wilson(Rita),Ronn Riser(Stanley),Angela Means(Felisha),Kathleen Bradley(Mrs. Parker),Tony Cox(Mr. Parker),Demetrius Navarro(Hector),Jason Bose Smith(Lil' Chris)and Vickilyn Reynolds(Joann)give fun performances as well. The direction by F.Gary Gray is simple,yet great with Gray pointing and shooting,but at the same time still moving the camera and giving the film an a great energy and pace. Great direction,Gray. The score by Frank Fitzpatrick,Simon Franglen and Chuck Wild is is great and memorable and fits with the film's tone. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs from Dr. Dre(Keep Their Heads Ringin),Ice Cube(Friday),The Isley Brothers(Trying' To See Another Day)as well as classics from Curtis Mayfield(Freddie's Dead,Little Child,Running Wild),The Temptations(The Way You Do Things You Do),James Brown(Get Up(I Feel Like Being A Sex Machine),Rose Royce(I Wanna Get Next To You),Rick James(Mary Jane)and War(Low Rider)and other great songs Excellent soundtrack. In final word,if you love Comedy films,Urban films,Stoner films,Hip-Hop,Rap or films in general, I highly suggest you see Friday,a classic Comedy that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended 10/10.

    Proof positive that you don't need a big budget and special effects to make a great movie. "Friday" is all about comedy, the characters, and great storytelling. This movie is a classic comedy that stars Ice Cube, John Witherspoon, Nia Long, the late Bernie Mac, Regina King, Anna Maria Horsford and Chris Tucker in his breakthrough role as Smokie. It follows a day (Friday) in the life of Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and his best friend Smokie, who in my opinion, steals the show. This is the movie that would define the rest of Chris Tucker's career. You know that the film is low-budget, but F. Gary Gary's experience as video director shows here with his ability to tell a story on a small budget. The pace of the movie is flawless, as we me from one funny incident to the next. All the elements of the subplots get intertwined together for the climax of the film. It's executed brilliantly. I have this movie in my DVD collect and have seen it at least two dozen times. I know all the words to the dialogue by heart. It's just that good! The two sequels to this film, "Next Friday" and "Friday After Next" were bigger box office hits, but they also had bigger budgets. Still, these two pale in comparison to the original when it comes to great movie making. Not even Rebecca Black can foul this "Friday".

    This movie gets better every time I watch it simply because how well it's written. The acting is great for a comedy film and the story is smoothly played out in the course of one day. Friday is one of those films that doesn't try to be obnoxiously funny every second (like Step Brothers) and because of this, it's funnier than most comedy movies that come out today. Also because it is just plain hilarious all around. The actors were chosen wisely and all do their part great. The story is interesting and funny while not being too crazy in order to generate laughs (like The Hangover Part II, which I still love anyway) There isn't much to say about this movie besides the fact that it's hilarious, quotable and overall very memorable. This is like the Pineapple Express of the 90's. So if you're looking for a funny ass movie, go find it and watch it. You wont regret it.

    OPEN LETTER: I have been watching this movie since I was 6 years old.This movie? This movie right here? I can watch this movie over and over and I still laugh. ALL my friends love it. White, Black, Asian - It's great and funny! It can be defined in one word: CLASSIC! ACTUAL REVIEW: Wanna laugh? Watch this. Classic characters, classic soundtrack , classic tale, classic LINES! It is also very relate-able. We all know a Smokey "the pothead" or a Craig "the responsible one." Even though it was made in the 90's, this movie defies generations because of that fact. It is truly underrated by A LOT of critics! IN THE END... WATCH IT! RENT IT! BUY IT! STEAL IT! (okay don't do the last one) But just watch it! I give it 9 out of 10 stars.

    Watched the movie 15 years after its release and enjoyed it to its bone. Rent it and watch it in the late afternoons of the summer kind of a movie. The characters in the movie are real funny and the actors have done a good job. Personally i feel this is one of the funniest black movie of all times.Chris's character has pulled off the movie, a smoke head getting in all sorts of trouble not as Chong but saner and much more funnier. This is one of the movies that you want to watch again and again. Ice Cube has done a great job with the script. With a serious situation on the hands of ghetto guys where one is doped and care free, and the other unlucky, find out ways to sort one problem after the other. I don't understand why Chris hasn't done more films, good actor, not bad at all. You watch this and you go to the store looking for more of Chris to find almost nothing except Rush Hour.
