 <sinopse>
  A man who has failed as a father and husband commits a heist to make money for his fledging business, but things become complicated when his wife interferes.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Bob Rafelson has stated that this is the final part of an informal trilogy he started with "Five Easy Pieces" and continued with "The King Of Marvin Gardens". In the three, Nicholson has now played son, brother and father. In this one, Nicholson is a wealthy wine dealer who has distanced himself from his wife with his philandering and from his son with his negligence. After he steals a diamond necklace with the help of a safecracker partner, Victor, things start coming apart. His wife sets out to interrupt what she thinks is another one of his weekend dalliances, but is really his trip to pawn the jewels.

    Here's a pretty good movie with some name stars in it. Jack Nicholson plays a wine dealer who plans to turn around his failing business by stealing diamonds from a rich client. He's also having a fling with their nanny, played by a not yet famous Jennifer Lopez. However, his family takes the diamonds unknowingly, setting up chases and conflicts. The performances are tight, and it's a gritty movie. Nicholson plays a truly detestable character. Michael Caine plays his rather sad partner, who is dying of cancer and trying to get one last score so he can die in comfort. Lopez is actually pretty good, it's before they actually gave her control over her productions.

    Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson supported each others careers in the 70s with movies like 'The king of Marvin gardens' and 'Five easy pieces'. 'Blood and wine' was the third part in the trilogy. Rafelson's movies were very unique in their own way with Nicholson. His movies were very highly focused on relationships and this formed the core in every movie. In 'Blood and wine' Nicholson is playing the father and son and again delivers another fantastic performance. Regardless of the role, Nicholson is always in top form and most times has the ability carry the movie independently. The noir atmosphere is not continuously present in the movie. The theme of betrayal, greed and loyalty is common to all in this genre and the movie covers this field on a large scale. The only noir factor that missing is the femme fa tale element. However this does not take away any charm from the movie. Many intriguing and suspenseful moments are directed in a unique way that makes the movie's routine theme appear eye capturing. In the initial phase of the movie one would immediately assume that this is a heist movie. However the second half dispels all doubts. The basic theme revolves around the theft of a expensive diamond necklace and how bitter relations leads the characters in to a game of cat and mouse. The character interactions in the second half progresses the movie steadily and there is never a irrelevant segment. In terms of plot, the writer (Nick Viltues) has accomplished some good writing but many criticised the movie for it's lack of character depth and even for it's climax. In my opinion only on a re watch the movie's real quality can be appreciated. If one views the movie with concentration and focus, he/she will realise that the u.s.p of the movie is in the performances and dialogues. 'Blood and wine' is not a classic but truly a milestone for introducing the noir genre in to the nineties. Later movies like 'U Turn' and 'Lost Highway' followed. SPOILERS AHEAD Nicholson plays a wine merchant who is having a bitter relationship with his wife (Davis) and son (Dorff). His neglecting attitude has created a rift in relations in the household. He and Caine who plays a ageing safe-cracker on parole plan to steal a expensive necklace from the a rich family's residence while they are on vacation. They aim to achieve to do this with the help of a maid played by (Lopez). On the day they plan to steal they discover the maid has lost her job, however with a little inconvenience the pair still manage to get their hands on the necklace. Nicholson plans to travel to New York to sale it for a good price. He books a flight with Lopez who he is having an affair with. Unfortunately his wife discovers this which leads to a brawl and Nicholson becomes unconscious. Dorff arrives on the scene and him and his mother escape. Later Nicholson awakes and finds out that they took the suitcase that the necklace was hidden in. Him and Caine try to locate the mother and son but a high speed pursuit turns nasty which leads to the death of Dorff's mother. After this Dorff decides to get revenge with genius methods. He pits Caine against Nicholson and attempts to lure Nicholson with the necklace with the aid of Lopez. END OF SPOILERS For a small thriller the movie extracts brilliant performances from all involved. This element is the core of the movie and brings out life from a routine script. Plot twists are at a minimum however this does not deters ones' enjoyment from the movie. Every clever surprising plot development that occurs happens to the viewer's attention. Bob Rafelson's direction is standard and is in tone with the movies theme. Many close up shots of the character's faces are mesmerising. It captures feelings and emotions very realistically. Florida has become a common setting for movies of this nature. Body Heat, Palmetto and Wild things too used this location. This is another highlight for the movie but many scenes are shot indoors so outdoor scenery is restricted to a certain extent. The background score is very thin. It is not used at every point. Music is incorporated at moments when it can feel most effective with the scene. This was the first time pairing of Micheal Caine and Jack Nicholson. They are legends in their own right and make the movie worthy of watching whenever they appear on screen together. Their interactions and witticism are a highlight in the movie. Nicholson impresses in a negative role. This is something that he very renowned for. Stephen Dorff is commendable in the second half as his involvement is greater. He was an upcoming star and his facial and emotional expressions are on the mark. Jennifer Lopez was at the early stages of her career with this small role but her role serves it's purpose at the very end. Her Cuban accent attempt is was very charming. For those that enjoy cinema with a distinctive noir taste, this is highly recommended as performances are impressive.

    With the talent on board, Jack Nicholson, Michael Cane, Jennifer Lopez, and Stephen Dorff, "Blood and Wine" must be regarded as a misfire. The film seems strangely detached, with no real involvement for the audience. Jennife Lopez especially comes across as if she wasn't sure how to present herself. What you get are domestic disputes, disappearing diamonds, and disagreements among thieves, none of which are particularly interesting. Even the heist is depicted as an afterthought. With no likable characters, a script that seems underdeveloped, and little reason for the viewer to care about any of this, everything just sort of drifts along to nowhere. - MERK

    A terrific cast consisting of Jack Nicholson, Michael Caine, Judy Davis, Steven Dorff, and Jennifer Lopez star in "Blood & Wine," a 1996 film noir directed by Bob Rafelson. Nicholson is a wine dealer in a bad marriage with Judy Davis. He and a partner, Victor (Michael Caine) steal a diamond necklace. Nicholson's wife wants to catch him cheating on her, but what she interrupts is his trip to pawn the necklace. Things go bad from there. Despite the great cast and strong direction, this noir doesn't quite hang together. The talent is there, so perhaps the script could have been stronger. It does hold one's interest, however, and some nice twists. It's downbeat for sure, with flawed characters. Not quite up to Nicholson-Rafelson collaborations of the past, but okay.

    'Blood and Wine' has a sort of film noire feel to it. It reminds one of the Humphrey Bogart and Alfred Hitchcock classics. Though it's not as stylish a film Rafelson does make good use of the Florida locations. Some of the dialogues are interesting too. The element of suspense is well maintained but what really works for 'Blood and Wine' is the unusual cast. Jack Nicholson is not very different from his other films but it suits Alex Gates. Michael Caine is a knockout as the murderer with a bad cold. He's quite the scene-stealer. Judy Davis is first rate. Stephen Dorff plays holds his own. Jennifer Lopez is stunning. What is most striking is her natural beauty combined with a natural performance. She more than holds her own and brings a certain humanness and courage to an otherwise fragile Gabriella. Overall, Rafelson's is an intriguing little thriller with a fantastic cast.

    The story involves the theft of a multi-million-dollar necklace by thieves Jack Nicholson, who runs a wine shop in Miami, and Michael Caine, a safe cracker on parole. Nicholson packs his suitcase intending to leave his wife, Judy Davis, and his stepson, Steven Dorff, and run off to New York with his innocent girl friend, Jennifer Lopez. In New York, he intends to sell the hot ice to a fence and return to split the cash with Caine. At the last moment, Nicholson has an argument with his wife, she clobbers him with a poker, frantically throws some clothes into Nicholson's suitcase, and drives off with her son. The necklace is stashed in a compartment of the suitcase, although neither she nor Dorff knows it. They find out soon enough. Nicholson and Caine track them to Key Largo and there are arguments, fights, a car chase, until Davis and Caine wind up dead, Dorff takes off in his new boat for the horizon, Lopez drives off alone with one of the stones, and Nicholson winds up in the hands of the law. It has a lot going for it. Nicholson and Caine rarely go wrong. Judy Davis does hysteria well. Jennifer Lopez is a natural actress, a beautiful young woman with a cantilevered rear end. The locations include some of the more colorful parts of Florida. And there's one effective action scene during, and immediately after, the car chase. So why doesn't it work any better than it does? It's a mean-spirited movie. Every character seems greedy, spiteful, and deceitful. There's nobody to root for. It's easy to argue that this is rather more like real life than having good and evil splashed across the screen, but the values don't go much beyond that. No one has any particularly generous impulses. If someone dies, they simply disappear from the story. The only scene in which a genuine conflict of motives appears is when Nicholson is rooting around the bloodied body of his dying wife in an overturned car, searching desperately for the stupid necklace and sobbing with remorse at the same time. And even this is undercut by pettiness. Her last words to Nicholson: "**** you." The ill-considered roles cripple the performances too. Nobody is poor, but no one has a chance to do much more than try to outwit the others. It's also disturbing to see actors we like, like Caine and Nicholson, in parts so petty. They're fine when they are outrageously malignant and venomous. (Nicholson ululating hoarsely and limping through the snow with an ax in his hands.) But realistically, as reprobate as the rest of us? Nope. I also can't understand why the location shooting doesn't take advantage of Miami and the Keys, where it was clearly shot. We see mostly interiors and back yards. Even a fishing boat in the Gulf of Florida feels claustrophobic. There's no sense of space or even of the city. And the photography doesn't help, somehow nudging a viewer into the perception that southern Florida is chilly rather than shimmering in humidity and heat. Where's the sweat? John Huston's "Key Largo" was all shot on a Warner Brothers' sound stage and does a better job of establishing the atmosphere. Finally, the MacGuffin -- that million-dollar necklace -- bespeaking a lack of imagination. Sounds like a job for Charlie Chan. Well, I don't mean to be too harsh. It's not badly done. It's just that so many opportunities for it to have been better were missed in the script and in the direction. Disappointing.

    Again, a stellar cast cannot help this miserable film. Jack Nicholson and Michael Caine are on a caper to steal a necklace. Nicholson seems to be in a very bad marriage with Judy Davis. Davis is the bright moment in this otherwise uneven drama. She is explosive and pulls out all the stops in her violent scenes with "husband" Nicholson. Caine coughs up a storm here as the dying thief. At least, he got his wish by not dying in prison. Jennifer Lopez appears as the love interest of Nicholson and his stepson-the son of Davis. The films tends to become overly violent. There are frequent uses of sticks to do the beating. Someone should have taken a stick to this film.

    This movie leaves a totally pointless impression. It adds noting new or original to the genre and on top of that the movie is just not a well made one. They desperately tried to make things more interesting with its script but the movie in fact remains nothing more but a generic genre movie, that unnecessarily makes things hard on itself with its script and redundant characters. The story also doesn't always flow, which is due to some bad pacing and editing. At times it feels like sequences are missing and things occur too fast after each other. The story lacks proper back-story for the characters and when the movie tries to put in some emotions they work out blank and come over as artificial and forced and completely unrealistic or believable. You can also blame the director for this. I'll bet the movie would had been way better if it didn't took itself as serious as it did. Some more 'fun' wouldn't had damaged the movie. Because of the failed script not much works out in the movie. It's not tense, it's not mysterious, it's not surprising. The action feels lame and the love-story misplaced and unrealistic. Some of the dialog is horrendous and it makes the characters at times seem like dumb Neanderthalers. A real offense to the viewer's intelligence. Despite the fact that the movie is filled with stars, the movie still is miscast. In all fairness, I think Jennifer Lopez is a good actress but it just doesn't show in this movie, in which she plays a character with a thick Cuban accent, who is supposed to be the love interest of the movie of the two main characters. Stephen Dorff feels out of place since he's only ever real good and convincing as an actor when he plays a villain, which is mostly due to his looks. Still it's interesting to see Jack Nicholson and Michael Caine as partners in crime. Especially Nicholson makes the movie worthwhile at times and his character is perhaps the only real good and enjoyable one of the movie. Though Caine is also good at times but mostly when he acts as a different person in the movie. A movie to forget really fast. 4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I'm not sure why I haven't seen Blood and Wine from start to finish up until today, but it has always been intriguing as that one Jack Nicholson movie I would see in bits and pieces on TV, with J-Lo in an early supporting role as the not-quite femme fatale, and Michael Caine as a guy with a very bad cough. Seeing it today I'm reminded of the classic work Bob Rafelson, director, and Nicholson did back in the 70s, even if they already reached their peak on their first film, Five Easy Pieces. But at the least Blood and Wine represents a return to form for Nicholson under the director he worked with most, either as actor or writer (he co-wrote Head), especially in the F.E.P. role of a SOB, which, of course, is usually as easy for Nicholson as raising up his eyebrows. His character, Alex, is a criminal, but not a very good one, as he isn't entirely able to balance out his goals as a jewel thief and as an adulterer with Lopez's Gabriella. It doesn't help that his wife (Judy Davis) has a son from a previous marriage (Stephen Dorff), who has it in for Alex big-time. Meanwhile, that jewel necklace is almost up in the air, and all his craggy partner, Vic (Michael Caine), can do is cough a lot and act more as a dumb muscle than as a consummate professional. So in these ingredients, Rafelson and his writers have a classic, cooked-up noir with enough style by its actors and locale to make up for what would be considered 'too violent' to show back in the forties (probably too sexy too, what with Lopez's 'assets'). Rafelson knows this material needs the best cast, and assembled is the best cast for the job, where desperation, greed, proper morality and just a moment of piece of mind get shifted around but are always the constants that all these characters. Nicholson is, well, Nicholson, cold to the bone but also a great liar, violent, passionate, but won't stop till he gets his way. He's not breaking new ground or setting up himself for the usual awards circuits, but it's still very cool to see him playing Alex as believable work of sleaze, almost in the tradition of Bogart (he actually does just as good, if not better, here than he did in Rafelson's 'Postman' remake). Dorff, meanwhile, could be considered the weakest link with a cast like this, but he holds his own fairly well within his character's basic lines, especially when considering the roles he'd have to take later on. Caine is a natural at playing against "type", which doesn't really exist for him, and disappears into this pragmatic but vicious parolee. And actresses like Davis and Lopez fit into their roles in the "noir" mood with equal levels of ease. I wish I could see Lopez in more roles like this where we might not believe totally her intentions for either of the men in her life, but is not necessarily cruel like the old femme fatales either. Released, as they say, under the radar back in 96, Blood and Wine uses its Miami and Florida locales like they're still lush and lustful and engaging, and the danger here isn't diminished from what's usually expected in the urban cities and dark alleys. Rafelson's got his A-game on here with an enjoyable story where we can guess pretty much where it will lead- the wills of men tested head-to-head- but it's a lot of harsh fun getting there.

The element of suspense is well maintained but what really works for 'Blood and Wine' is the unusual cast. Jack Nicholson is not very different from his other films but it suits Alex Gates. Michael Caine is a knockout as the murderer with a bad cold. He's quite the scene-stealer. Judy Davis is first rate. Stephen Dorff plays holds his own. Jennifer Lopez is stunning. What is most striking is her natural beauty combined with a natural performance. She more than holds her own and brings a certain humanness and courage to an otherwise fragile Gabriella. Overall, Rafelson's is an intriguing little thriller with a fantastic cast.

    The story involves the theft of a multi-million-dollar necklace by thieves Jack Nicholson, who runs a wine shop in Miami, and Michael Caine, a safe cracker on parole. Nicholson packs his suitcase intending to leave his wife, Judy Davis, and his stepson, Steven Dorff, and run off to New York with his innocent girl friend, Jennifer Lopez. In New York, he intends to sell the hot ice to a fence and return to split the cash with Caine. At the last moment, Nicholson has an argument with his wife, she clobbers him with a poker, frantically throws some clothes into Nicholson's suitcase, and drives off with her son. The necklace is stashed in a compartment of the suitcase, although neither she nor Dorff knows it. They find out soon enough. Nicholson and Caine track them to Key Largo and there are arguments, fights, a car chase, until Davis and Caine wind up dead, Dorff takes off in his new boat for the horizon, Lopez drives off alone with one of the stones, and Nicholson winds up in the hands of the law. It has a lot going for it. Nicholson and Caine rarely go wrong. Judy Davis does hysteria well. Jennifer Lopez is a natural actress, a beautiful young woman with a cantilevered rear end. The locations include some of the more colorful parts of Florida. And there's one effective action scene during, and immediately after, the car chase. So why doesn't it work any better than it does? It's a mean-spirited movie. Every character seems greedy, spiteful, and deceitful. There's nobody to root for. It's easy to argue that this is rather more like real life than having good and evil splashed across the screen, but the values don't go much beyond that. No one has any particularly generous impulses. If someone dies, they simply disappear from the story. The only scene in which a genuine conflict of motives appears is when Nicholson is rooting around the bloodied body of his dying wife in an overturned car, searching desperately for the stupid necklace and sobbing with remorse at the same time. And even this is undercut by pettiness. Her last words to Nicholson: "**** you." The ill-considered roles cripple the performances too. Nobody is poor, but no one has a chance to do much more than try to outwit the others. It's also disturbing to see actors we like, like Caine and Nicholson, in parts so petty. They're fine when they are outrageously malignant and venomous. (Nicholson ululating hoarsely and limping through the snow with an ax in his hands.) But realistically, as reprobate as the rest of us? Nope. I also can't understand why the location shooting doesn't take advantage of Miami and the Keys, where it was clearly shot. We see mostly interiors and back yards. Even a fishing boat in the Gulf of Florida feels claustrophobic. There's no sense of space or even of the city. And the photography doesn't help, somehow nudging a viewer into the perception that southern Florida is chilly rather than shimmering in humidity and heat. Where's the sweat? John Huston's "Key Largo" was all shot on a Warner Brothers' sound stage and does a better job of establishing the atmosphere. Finally, the MacGuffin -- that million-dollar necklace -- bespeaking a lack of imagination. Sounds like a job for Charlie Chan. Well, I don't mean to be too harsh. It's not badly done. It's just that so many opportunities for it to have been better were missed in the script and in the direction. Disappointing.

    Again, a stellar cast cannot help this miserable film. Jack Nicholson and Michael Caine are on a caper to steal a necklace. Nicholson seems to be in a very bad marriage with Judy Davis. Davis is the bright moment in this otherwise uneven drama. She is explosive and pulls out all the stops in her violent scenes with "husband" Nicholson. Caine coughs up a storm here as the dying thief. At least, he got his wish by not dying in prison. Jennifer Lopez appears as the love interest of Nicholson and his stepson-the son of Davis. The films tends to become overly violent. There are frequent uses of sticks to do the beating. Someone should have taken a stick to this film.

    This movie leaves a totally pointless impression. It adds noting new or original to the genre and on top of that the movie is just not a well made one. They desperately tried to make things more interesting with its script but the movie in fact remains nothing more but a generic genre movie, that unnecessarily makes things hard on itself with its script and redundant characters. The story also doesn't always flow, which is due to some bad pacing and editing. At times it feels like sequences are missing and things occur too fast after each other. The story lacks proper back-story for the characters and when the movie tries to put in some emotions they work out blank and come over as artificial and forced and completely unrealistic or believable. You can also blame the director for this. I'll bet the movie would had been way better if it didn't took itself as serious as it did. Some more 'fun' wouldn't had damaged the movie. Because of the failed script not much works out in the movie. It's not tense, it's not mysterious, it's not surprising. The action feels lame and the love-story misplaced and unrealistic. Some of the dialog is horrendous and it makes the characters at times seem like dumb Neanderthalers. A real offense to the viewer's intelligence. Despite the fact that the movie is filled with stars, the movie still is miscast. In all fairness, I think Jennifer Lopez is a good actress but it just doesn't show in this movie, in which she plays a character with a thick Cuban accent, who is supposed to be the love interest of the movie of the two main characters. Stephen Dorff feels out of place since he's only ever real good and convincing as an actor when he plays a villain, which is mostly due to his looks. Still it's interesting to see Jack Nicholson and Michael Caine as partners in crime. Especially Nicholson makes the movie worthwhile at times and his character is perhaps the only real good and enjoyable one of the movie. Though Caine is also good at times but mostly when he acts as a different person in the movie. A movie to forget really fast. 4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I'm not sure why I haven't seen Blood and Wine from start to finish up until today, but it has always been intriguing as that one Jack Nicholson movie I would see in bits and pieces on TV, with J-Lo in an early supporting role as the not-quite femme fatale, and Michael Caine as a guy with a very bad cough. Seeing it today I'm reminded of the classic work Bob Rafelson, director, and Nicholson did back in the 70s, even if they already reached their peak on their first film, Five Easy Pieces. But at the least Blood and Wine represents a return to form for Nicholson under the director he worked with most, either as actor or writer (he co-wrote Head), especially in the F.E.P. role of a SOB, which, of course, is usually as easy for Nicholson as raising up his eyebrows. His character, Alex, is a criminal, but not a very good one, as he isn't entirely able to balance out his goals as a jewel thief and as an adulterer with Lopez's Gabriella. It doesn't help that his wife (Judy Davis) has a son from a previous marriage (Stephen Dorff), who has it in for Alex big-time. Meanwhile, that jewel necklace is almost up in the air, and all his craggy partner, Vic (Michael Caine), can do is cough a lot and act more as a dumb muscle than as a consummate professional. So in these ingredients, Rafelson and his writers have a classic, cooked-up noir with enough style by its actors and locale to make up for what would be considered 'too violent' to show back in the forties (probably too sexy too, what with Lopez's 'assets'). Rafelson knows this material needs the best cast, and assembled is the best cast for the job, where desperation, greed, proper morality and just a moment of piece of mind get shifted around but are always the constants that all these characters. Nicholson is, well, Nicholson, cold to the bone but also a great liar, violent, passionate, but won't stop till he gets his way. He's not breaking new ground or setting up himself for the usual awards circuits, but it's still very cool to see him playing Alex as believable work of sleaze, almost in the tradition of Bogart (he actually does just as good, if not better, here than he did in Rafelson's 'Postman' remake). Dorff, meanwhile, could be considered the weakest link with a cast like this, but he holds his own fairly well within his character's basic lines, especially when considering the roles he'd have to take later on. Caine is a natural at playing against "type", which doesn't really exist for him, and disappears into this pragmatic but vicious parolee. And actresses like Davis and Lopez fit into their roles in the "noir" mood with equal levels of ease. I wish I could see Lopez in more roles like this where we might not believe totally her intentions for either of the men in her life, but is not necessarily cruel like the old femme fatales either. Released, as they say, under the radar back in 96, Blood and Wine uses its Miami and Florida locales like they're still lush and lustful and engaging, and the danger here isn't diminished from what's usually expected in the urban cities and dark alleys. Rafelson's got his A-game on here with an enjoyable story where we can guess pretty much where it will lead- the wills of men tested head-to-head- but it's a lot of harsh fun getting there.

    Here's a pretty good movie with some name stars in it. Jack Nicholson plays a wine dealer who plans to turn around his failing business by stealing diamonds from a rich client. He's also having a fling with their nanny, played by a not yet famous Jennifer Lopez. However, his family takes the diamonds unknowingly, setting up chases and conflicts. The performances are tight, and it's a gritty movie. Nicholson plays a truly detestable character. Michael Caine plays his rather sad partner, who is dying of cancer and trying to get one last score so he can die in comfort. Lopez is actually pretty good, it's before they actually gave her control over her productions.

    Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson supported each others careers in the 70s with movies like 'The king of Marvin gardens' and 'Five easy pieces'. 'Blood and wine' was the third part in the trilogy. Rafelson's movies were very unique in their own way with Nicholson. His movies were very highly focused on relationships and this formed the core in every movie. In 'Blood and wine' Nicholson is playing the father and son and again delivers another fantastic performance. Regardless of the role, Nicholson is always in top form and most times has the ability carry the movie independently. The noir atmosphere is not continuously present in the movie. The theme of betrayal, greed and loyalty is common to all in this genre and the movie covers this field on a large scale. The only noir factor that missing is the femme fa tale element. However this does not take away any charm from the movie. Many intriguing and suspenseful moments are directed in a unique way that makes the movie's routine theme appear eye capturing. In the initial phase of the movie one would immediately assume that this is a heist movie. However the second half dispels all doubts. The basic theme revolves around the theft of a expensive diamond necklace and how bitter relations leads the characters in to a game of cat and mouse. The character interactions in the second half progresses the movie steadily and there is never a irrelevant segment. In terms of plot, the writer (Nick Viltues) has accomplished some good writing but many criticised the movie for it's lack of character depth and even for it's climax. In my opinion only on a re watch the movie's real quality can be appreciated. If one views the movie with concentration and focus, he/she will realise that the u.s.p of the movie is in the performances and dialogues. 'Blood and wine' is not a classic but truly a milestone for introducing the noir genre in to the nineties. Later movies like 'U Turn' and 'Lost Highway' followed. SPOILERS AHEAD Nicholson plays a wine merchant who is having a bitter relationship with his wife (Davis) and son (Dorff). His neglecting attitude has created a rift in relations in the household. He and Caine who plays a ageing safe-cracker on parole plan to steal a expensive necklace from the a rich family's residence while they are on vacation. They aim to achieve to do this with the help of a maid played by (Lopez). On the day they plan to steal they discover the maid has lost her job, however with a little inconvenience the pair still manage to get their hands on the necklace. Nicholson plans to travel to New York to sale it for a good price. He books a flight with Lopez who he is having an affair with. Unfortunately his wife discovers this which leads to a brawl and Nicholson becomes unconscious. Dorff arrives on the scene and him and his mother escape. Later Nicholson awakes and finds out that they took the suitcase that the necklace was hidden in. Him and Caine try to locate the mother and son but a high speed pursuit turns nasty which leads to the death of Dorff's mother. After this Dorff decides to get revenge with genius methods. He pits Caine against Nicholson and attempts to lure Nicholson with the necklace with the aid of Lopez. END OF SPOILERS For a small thriller the movie extracts brilliant performances from all involved. This element is the core of the movie and brings out life from a routine script. Plot twists are at a minimum however this does not deters ones' enjoyment from the movie. Every clever surprising plot development that occurs happens to the viewer's attention. Bob Rafelson's direction is standard and is in tone with the movies theme. Many close up shots of the character's faces are mesmerising. It captures feelings and emotions very realistically. Florida has become a common setting for movies of this nature. Body Heat, Palmetto and Wild things too used this location. This is another highlight for the movie but many scenes are shot indoors so outdoor scenery is restricted to a certain extent. The background score is very thin. It is not used at every point. Music is incorporated at moments when it can feel most effective with the scene. This was the first time pairing of Micheal Caine and Jack Nicholson. They are legends in their own right and make the movie worthy of watching whenever they appear on screen together. Their interactions and witticism are a highlight in the movie. Nicholson impresses in a negative role. This is something that he very renowned for. Stephen Dorff is commendable in the second half as his involvement is greater. He was an upcoming star and his facial and emotional expressions are on the mark. Jennifer Lopez was at the early stages of her career with this small role but her role serves it's purpose at the very end. Her Cuban accent attempt is was very charming. For those that enjoy cinema with a distinctive noir taste, this is highly recommended as performances are impressive.

    With the talent on board, Jack Nicholson, Michael Cane, Jennifer Lopez, and Stephen Dorff, "Blood and Wine" must be regarded as a misfire. The film seems strangely detached, with no real involvement for the audience. Jennife Lopez especially comes across as if she wasn't sure how to present herself. What you get are domestic disputes, disappearing diamonds, and disagreements among thieves, none of which are particularly interesting. Even the heist is depicted as an afterthought. With no likable characters, a script that seems underdeveloped, and little reason for the viewer to care about any of this, everything just sort of drifts along to nowhere. - MERK

    A terrific cast consisting of Jack Nicholson, Michael Caine, Judy Davis, Steven Dorff, and Jennifer Lopez star in "Blood & Wine," a 1996 film noir directed by Bob Rafelson. Nicholson is a wine dealer in a bad marriage with Judy Davis. He and a partner, Victor (Michael Caine) steal a diamond necklace. Nicholson's wife wants to catch him cheating on her, but what she interrupts is his trip to pawn the necklace. Things go bad from there. Despite the great cast and strong direction, this noir doesn't quite hang together. The talent is there, so perhaps the script could have been stronger. It does hold one's interest, however, and some nice twists. It's downbeat for sure, with flawed characters. Not quite up to Nicholson-Rafelson collaborations of the past, but okay.

    Here's a pretty good movie with some name stars in it. Jack Nicholson plays a wine dealer who plans to turn around his failing business by stealing diamonds from a rich client. He's also having a fling with their nanny, played by a not yet famous Jennifer Lopez. However, his family takes the diamonds unknowingly, setting up chases and conflicts. The performances are tight, and it's a gritty movie. Nicholson plays a truly detestable character. Michael Caine plays his rather sad partner, who is dying of cancer and trying to get one last score so he can die in comfort. Lopez is actually pretty good, it's before they actually gave her control over her productions.

    Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson supported each others careers in the 70s with movies like 'The king of Marvin gardens' and 'Five easy pieces'. 'Blood and wine' was the third part in the trilogy. Rafelson's movies were very unique in their own way with Nicholson. His movies were very highly focused on relationships and this formed the core in every movie. In 'Blood and wine' Nicholson is playing the father and son and again delivers another fantastic performance. Regardless of the role, Nicholson is always in top form and most times has the ability carry the movie independently. The noir atmosphere is not continuously present in the movie. The theme of betrayal, greed and loyalty is common to all in this genre and the movie covers this field on a large scale. The only noir factor that missing is the femme fa tale element. However this does not take away any charm from the movie. Many intriguing and suspenseful moments are directed in a unique way that makes the movie's routine theme appear eye capturing. In the initial phase of the movie one would immediately assume that this is a heist movie. However the second half dispels all doubts. The basic theme revolves around the theft of a expensive diamond necklace and how bitter relations leads the characters in to a game of cat and mouse. The character interactions in the second half progresses the movie steadily and there is never a irrelevant segment. In terms of plot, the writer (Nick Viltues) has accomplished some good writing but many criticised the movie for it's lack of character depth and even for it's climax. In my opinion only on a re watch the movie's real quality can be appreciated. If one views the movie with concentration and focus, he/she will realise that the u.s.p of the movie is in the performances and dialogues. 'Blood and wine' is not a classic but truly a milestone for introducing the noir genre in to the nineties. Later movies like 'U Turn' and 'Lost Highway' followed. SPOILERS AHEAD Nicholson plays a wine merchant who is having a bitter relationship with his wife (Davis) and son (Dorff). His neglecting attitude has created a rift in relations in the household. He and Caine who plays a ageing safe-cracker on parole plan to steal a expensive necklace from the a rich family's residence while they are on vacation. They aim to achieve to do this with the help of a maid played by (Lopez). On the day they plan to steal they discover the maid has lost her job, however with a little inconvenience the pair still manage to get their hands on the necklace. Nicholson plans to travel to New York to sale it for a good price. He books a flight with Lopez who he is having an affair with. Unfortunately his wife discovers this which leads to a brawl and Nicholson becomes unconscious. Dorff arrives on the scene and him and his mother escape. Later Nicholson awakes and finds out that they took the suitcase that the necklace was hidden in. Him and Caine try to locate the mother and son but a high speed pursuit turns nasty which leads to the death of Dorff's mother. After this Dorff decides to get revenge with genius methods. He pits Caine against Nicholson and attempts to lure Nicholson with the necklace with the aid of Lopez. END OF SPOILERS For a small thriller the movie extracts brilliant performances from all involved. This element is the core of the movie and brings out life from a routine script. Plot twists are at a minimum however this does not deters ones' enjoyment from the movie. Every clever surprising plot development that occurs happens to the viewer's attention. Bob Rafelson's direction is standard and is in tone with the movies theme. Many close up shots of the character's faces are mesmerising. It captures feelings and emotions very realistically. Florida has become a common setting for movies of this nature. Body Heat, Palmetto and Wild things too used this location. This is another highlight for the movie but many scenes are shot indoors so outdoor scenery is restricted to a certain extent. The background score is very thin. It is not used at every point. Music is incorporated at moments when it can feel most effective with the scene. This was the first time pairing of Micheal Caine and Jack Nicholson. They are legends in their own right and make the movie worthy of watching whenever they appear on screen together. Their interactions and witticism are a highlight in the movie. Nicholson impresses in a negative role. This is something that he very renowned for. Stephen Dorff is commendable in the second half as his involvement is greater. He was an upcoming star and his facial and emotional expressions are on the mark. Jennifer Lopez was at the early stages of her career with this small role but her role serves it's purpose at the very end. Her Cuban accent attempt is was very charming. For those that enjoy cinema with a distinctive noir taste, this is highly recommended as performances are impressive.

    With the talent on board, Jack Nicholson, Michael Cane, Jennifer Lopez, and Stephen Dorff, "Blood and Wine" must be regarded as a misfire. The film seems strangely detached, with no real involvement for the audience. Jennife Lopez especially comes across as if she wasn't sure how to present herself. What you get are domestic disputes, disappearing diamonds, and disagreements among thieves, none of which are particularly interesting. Even the heist is depicted as an afterthought. With no likable characters, a script that seems underdeveloped, and little reason for the viewer to care about any of this, everything just sort of drifts along to nowhere. - MERK

    A terrific cast consisting of Jack Nicholson, Michael Caine, Judy Davis, Steven Dorff, and Jennifer Lopez star in "Blood & Wine," a 1996 film noir directed by Bob Rafelson. Nicholson is a wine dealer in a bad marriage with Judy Davis. He and a partner, Victor (Michael Caine) steal a diamond necklace. Nicholson's wife wants to catch him cheating on her, but what she interrupts is his trip to pawn the necklace. Things go bad from there. Despite the great cast and strong direction, this noir doesn't quite hang together. The talent is there, so perhaps the script could have been stronger. It does hold one's interest, however, and some nice twists. It's downbeat for sure, with flawed characters. Not quite up to Nicholson-Rafelson collaborations of the past, but okay.

    'Blood and Wine' has a sort of film noire feel to it. It reminds one of the Humphrey Bogart and Alfred Hitchcock classics. Though it's not as stylish a film Rafelson does make good use of the Florida locations. Some of the dialogues are interesting too. The element of suspense is well maintained but what really works for 'Blood and Wine' is the unusual cast. Jack Nicholson is not very different from his other films but it suits Alex Gates. Michael Caine is a knockout as the murderer with a bad cold. He's quite the scene-stealer. Judy Davis is first rate. Stephen Dorff plays holds his own. Jennifer Lopez is stunning. What is most striking is her natural beauty combined with a natural performance. She more than holds her own and brings a certain humanness and courage to an otherwise fragile Gabriella. Overall, Rafelson's is an intriguing little thriller with a fantastic cast.

    The story involves the theft of a multi-million-dollar necklace by thieves Jack Nicholson, who runs a wine shop in Miami, and Michael Caine, a safe cracker on parole. Nicholson packs his suitcase intending to leave his wife, Judy Davis, and his stepson, Steven Dorff, and run off to New York with his innocent girl friend, Jennifer Lopez. In New York, he intends to sell the hot ice to a fence and return to split the cash with Caine. At the last moment, Nicholson has an argument with his wife, she clobbers him with a poker, frantically throws some clothes into Nicholson's suitcase, and drives off with her son. The necklace is stashed in a compartment of the suitcase, although neither she nor Dorff knows it. They find out soon enough. Nicholson and Caine track them to Key Largo and there are arguments, fights, a car chase, until Davis and Caine wind up dead, Dorff takes off in his new boat for the horizon, Lopez drives off alone with one of the stones, and Nicholson winds up in the hands of the law. It has a lot going for it. Nicholson and Caine rarely go wrong. Judy Davis does hysteria well. Jennifer Lopez is a natural actress, a beautiful young woman with a cantilevered rear end. The locations include some of the more colorful parts of Florida. And there's one effective action scene during, and immediately after, the car chase. So why doesn't it work any better than it does? It's a mean-spirited movie. Every character seems greedy, spiteful, and deceitful. There's nobody to root for. It's easy to argue that this is rather more like real life than having good and evil splashed across the screen, but the values don't go much beyond that. No one has any particularly generous impulses. If someone dies, they simply disappear from the story. The only scene in which a genuine conflict of motives appears is when Nicholson is rooting around the bloodied body of his dying wife in an overturned car, searching desperately for the stupid necklace and sobbing with remorse at the same time. And even this is undercut by pettiness. Her last words to Nicholson: "**** you." The ill-considered roles cripple the performances too. Nobody is poor, but no one has a chance to do much more than try to outwit the others. It's also disturbing to see actors we like, like Caine and Nicholson, in parts so petty. They're fine when they are outrageously malignant and venomous. (Nicholson ululating hoarsely and limping through the snow with an ax in his hands.) But realistically, as reprobate as the rest of us? Nope. I also can't understand why the location shooting doesn't take advantage of Miami and the Keys, where it was clearly shot. We see mostly interiors and back yards. Even a fishing boat in the Gulf of Florida feels claustrophobic. There's no sense of space or even of the city. And the photography doesn't help, somehow nudging a viewer into the perception that southern Florida is chilly rather than shimmering in humidity and heat. Where's the sweat? John Huston's "Key Largo" was all shot on a Warner Brothers' sound stage and does a better job of establishing the atmosphere. Finally, the MacGuffin -- that million-dollar necklace -- bespeaking a lack of imagination. Sounds like a job for Charlie Chan. Well, I don't mean to be too harsh. It's not badly done. It's just that so many opportunities for it to have been better were missed in the script and in the direction. Disappointing.

    Again, a stellar cast cannot help this miserable film. Jack Nicholson and Michael Caine are on a caper to steal a necklace. Nicholson seems to be in a very bad marriage with Judy Davis. Davis is the bright moment in this otherwise uneven drama. She is explosive and pulls out all the stops in her violent scenes with "husband" Nicholson. Caine coughs up a storm here as the dying thief. At least, he got his wish by not dying in prison. Jennifer Lopez appears as the love interest of Nicholson and his stepson-the son of Davis. The films tends to become overly violent. There are frequent uses of sticks to do the beating. Someone should have taken a stick to this film.

    This movie leaves a totally pointless impression. It adds noting new or original to the genre and on top of that the movie is just not a well made one. They desperately tried to make things more interesting with its script but the movie in fact remains nothing more but a generic genre movie, that unnecessarily makes things hard on itself with its script and redundant characters. The story also doesn't always flow, which is due to some bad pacing and editing. At times it feels like sequences are missing and things occur too fast after each other. The story lacks proper back-story for the characters and when the movie tries to put in some emotions they work out blank and come over as artificial and forced and completely unrealistic or believable. You can also blame the director for this. I'll bet the movie would had been way better if it didn't took itself as serious as it did. Some more 'fun' wouldn't had damaged the movie. Because of the failed script not much works out in the movie. It's not tense, it's not mysterious, it's not surprising. The action feels lame and the love-story misplaced and unrealistic. Some of the dialog is horrendous and it makes the characters at times seem like dumb Neanderthalers. A real offense to the viewer's intelligence. Despite the fact that the movie is filled with stars, the movie still is miscast. In all fairness, I think Jennifer Lopez is a good actress but it just doesn't show in this movie, in which she plays a character with a thick Cuban accent, who is supposed to be the love interest of the movie of the two main characters. Stephen Dorff feels out of place since he's only ever real good and convincing as an actor when he plays a villain, which is mostly due to his looks. Still it's interesting to see Jack Nicholson and Michael Caine as partners in crime. Especially Nicholson makes the movie worthwhile at times and his character is perhaps the only real good and enjoyable one of the movie. Though Caine is also good at times but mostly when he acts as a different person in the movie. A movie to forget really fast. 4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I'm not sure why I haven't seen Blood and Wine from start to finish up until today, but it has always been intriguing as that one Jack Nicholson movie I would see in bits and pieces on TV, with J-Lo in an early supporting role as the not-quite femme fatale, and Michael Caine as a guy with a very bad cough. Seeing it today I'm reminded of the classic work Bob Rafelson, director, and Nicholson did back in the 70s, even if they already reached their peak on their first film, Five Easy Pieces. But at the least Blood and Wine represents a return to form for Nicholson under the director he worked with most, either as actor or writer (he co-wrote Head), especially in the F.E.P. role of a SOB, which, of course, is usually as easy for Nicholson as raising up his eyebrows. His character, Alex, is a criminal, but not a very good one, as he isn't entirely able to balance out his goals as a jewel thief and as an adulterer with Lopez's Gabriella. It doesn't help that his wife (Judy Davis) has a son from a previous marriage (Stephen Dorff), who has it in for Alex big-time. Meanwhile, that jewel necklace is almost up in the air, and all his craggy partner, Vic (Michael Caine), can do is cough a lot and act more as a dumb muscle than as a consummate professional. So in these ingredients, Rafelson and his writers have a classic, cooked-up noir with enough style by its actors and locale to make up for what would be considered 'too violent' to show back in the forties (probably too sexy too, what with Lopez's 'assets'). Rafelson knows this material needs the best cast, and assembled is the best cast for the job, where desperation, greed, proper morality and just a moment of piece of mind get shifted around but are always the constants that all these characters. Nicholson is, well, Nicholson, cold to the bone but also a great liar, violent, passionate, but won't stop till he gets his way. He's not breaking new ground or setting up himself for the usual awards circuits, but it's still very cool to see him playing Alex as believable work of sleaze, almost in the tradition of Bogart (he actually does just as good, if not better, here than he did in Rafelson's 'Postman' remake). Dorff, meanwhile, could be considered the weakest link with a cast like this, but he holds his own fairly well within his character's basic lines, especially when considering the roles he'd have to take later on. Caine is a natural at playing against "type", which doesn't really exist for him, and disappears into this pragmatic but vicious parolee. And actresses like Davis and Lopez fit into their roles in the "noir" mood with equal levels of ease. I wish I could see Lopez in more roles like this where we might not believe totally her intentions for either of the men in her life, but is not necessarily cruel like the old femme fatales either. Released, as they say, under the radar back in 96, Blood and Wine uses its Miami and Florida locales like they're still lush and lustful and engaging, and the danger here isn't diminished from what's usually expected in the urban cities and dark alleys. Rafelson's got his A-game on here with an enjoyable story where we can guess pretty much where it will lead- the wills of men tested head-to-head- but it's a lot of harsh fun getting there.

And even this is undercut by pettiness. Her last words to Nicholson: "**** you." The ill-considered roles cripple the performances too. Nobody is poor, but no one has a chance to do much more than try to outwit the others. It's also disturbing to see actors we like, like Caine and Nicholson, in parts so petty. They're fine when they are outrageously malignant and venomous. (Nicholson ululating hoarsely and limping through the snow with an ax in his hands.) But realistically, as reprobate as the rest of us? Nope. I also can't understand why the location shooting doesn't take advantage of Miami and the Keys, where it was clearly shot. We see mostly interiors and back yards. Even a fishing boat in the Gulf of Florida feels claustrophobic. There's no sense of space or even of the city. And the photography doesn't help, somehow nudging a viewer into the perception that southern Florida is chilly rather than shimmering in humidity and heat. Where's the sweat? John Huston's "Key Largo" was all shot on a Warner Brothers' sound stage and does a better job of establishing the atmosphere. Finally, the MacGuffin -- that million-dollar necklace -- bespeaking a lack of imagination. Sounds like a job for Charlie Chan. Well, I don't mean to be too harsh. It's not badly done. It's just that so many opportunities for it to have been better were missed in the script and in the direction. Disappointing.

    Again, a stellar cast cannot help this miserable film. Jack Nicholson and Michael Caine are on a caper to steal a necklace. Nicholson seems to be in a very bad marriage with Judy Davis. Davis is the bright moment in this otherwise uneven drama. She is explosive and pulls out all the stops in her violent scenes with "husband" Nicholson. Caine coughs up a storm here as the dying thief. At least, he got his wish by not dying in prison. Jennifer Lopez appears as the love interest of Nicholson and his stepson-the son of Davis. The films tends to become overly violent. There are frequent uses of sticks to do the beating. Someone should have taken a stick to this film.

    This movie leaves a totally pointless impression. It adds noting new or original to the genre and on top of that the movie is just not a well made one. They desperately tried to make things more interesting with its script but the movie in fact remains nothing more but a generic genre movie, that unnecessarily makes things hard on itself with its script and redundant characters. The story also doesn't always flow, which is due to some bad pacing and editing. At times it feels like sequences are missing and things occur too fast after each other. The story lacks proper back-story for the characters and when the movie tries to put in some emotions they work out blank and come over as artificial and forced and completely unrealistic or believable. You can also blame the director for this. I'll bet the movie would had been way better if it didn't took itself as serious as it did. Some more 'fun' wouldn't had damaged the movie. Because of the failed script not much works out in the movie. It's not tense, it's not mysterious, it's not surprising. The action feels lame and the love-story misplaced and unrealistic. Some of the dialog is horrendous and it makes the characters at times seem like dumb Neanderthalers. A real offense to the viewer's intelligence. Despite the fact that the movie is filled with stars, the movie still is miscast. In all fairness, I think Jennifer Lopez is a good actress but it just doesn't show in this movie, in which she plays a character with a thick Cuban accent, who is supposed to be the love interest of the movie of the two main characters. Stephen Dorff feels out of place since he's only ever real good and convincing as an actor when he plays a villain, which is mostly due to his looks. Still it's interesting to see Jack Nicholson and Michael Caine as partners in crime. Especially Nicholson makes the movie worthwhile at times and his character is perhaps the only real good and enjoyable one of the movie. Though Caine is also good at times but mostly when he acts as a different person in the movie. A movie to forget really fast. 4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I'm not sure why I haven't seen Blood and Wine from start to finish up until today, but it has always been intriguing as that one Jack Nicholson movie I would see in bits and pieces on TV, with J-Lo in an early supporting role as the not-quite femme fatale, and Michael Caine as a guy with a very bad cough. Seeing it today I'm reminded of the classic work Bob Rafelson, director, and Nicholson did back in the 70s, even if they already reached their peak on their first film, Five Easy Pieces. But at the least Blood and Wine represents a return to form for Nicholson under the director he worked with most, either as actor or writer (he co-wrote Head), especially in the F.E.P. role of a SOB, which, of course, is usually as easy for Nicholson as raising up his eyebrows. His character, Alex, is a criminal, but not a very good one, as he isn't entirely able to balance out his goals as a jewel thief and as an adulterer with Lopez's Gabriella. It doesn't help that his wife (Judy Davis) has a son from a previous marriage (Stephen Dorff), who has it in for Alex big-time. Meanwhile, that jewel necklace is almost up in the air, and all his craggy partner, Vic (Michael Caine), can do is cough a lot and act more as a dumb muscle than as a consummate professional. So in these ingredients, Rafelson and his writers have a classic, cooked-up noir with enough style by its actors and locale to make up for what would be considered 'too violent' to show back in the forties (probably too sexy too, what with Lopez's 'assets'). Rafelson knows this material needs the best cast, and assembled is the best cast for the job, where desperation, greed, proper morality and just a moment of piece of mind get shifted around but are always the constants that all these characters. Nicholson is, well, Nicholson, cold to the bone but also a great liar, violent, passionate, but won't stop till he gets his way. He's not breaking new ground or setting up himself for the usual awards circuits, but it's still very cool to see him playing Alex as believable work of sleaze, almost in the tradition of Bogart (he actually does just as good, if not better, here than he did in Rafelson's 'Postman' remake). Dorff, meanwhile, could be considered the weakest link with a cast like this, but he holds his own fairly well within his character's basic lines, especially when considering the roles he'd have to take later on. Caine is a natural at playing against "type", which doesn't really exist for him, and disappears into this pragmatic but vicious parolee. And actresses like Davis and Lopez fit into their roles in the "noir" mood with equal levels of ease. I wish I could see Lopez in more roles like this where we might not believe totally her intentions for either of the men in her life, but is not necessarily cruel like the old femme fatales either. Released, as they say, under the radar back in 96, Blood and Wine uses its Miami and Florida locales like they're still lush and lustful and engaging, and the danger here isn't diminished from what's usually expected in the urban cities and dark alleys. Rafelson's got his A-game on here with an enjoyable story where we can guess pretty much where it will lead- the wills of men tested head-to-head- but it's a lot of harsh fun getting there.

    Here's a pretty good movie with some name stars in it. Jack Nicholson plays a wine dealer who plans to turn around his failing business by stealing diamonds from a rich client. He's also having a fling with their nanny, played by a not yet famous Jennifer Lopez. However, his family takes the diamonds unknowingly, setting up chases and conflicts. The performances are tight, and it's a gritty movie. Nicholson plays a truly detestable character. Michael Caine plays his rather sad partner, who is dying of cancer and trying to get one last score so he can die in comfort. Lopez is actually pretty good, it's before they actually gave her control over her productions.

    Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson supported each others careers in the 70s with movies like 'The king of Marvin gardens' and 'Five easy pieces'. 'Blood and wine' was the third part in the trilogy. Rafelson's movies were very unique in their own way with Nicholson. His movies were very highly focused on relationships and this formed the core in every movie. In 'Blood and wine' Nicholson is playing the father and son and again delivers another fantastic performance. Regardless of the role, Nicholson is always in top form and most times has the ability carry the movie independently. The noir atmosphere is not continuously present in the movie. The theme of betrayal, greed and loyalty is common to all in this genre and the movie covers this field on a large scale. The only noir factor that missing is the femme fa tale element. However this does not take away any charm from the movie. Many intriguing and suspenseful moments are directed in a unique way that makes the movie's routine theme appear eye capturing. In the initial phase of the movie one would immediately assume that this is a heist movie. However the second half dispels all doubts. The basic theme revolves around the theft of a expensive diamond necklace and how bitter relations leads the characters in to a game of cat and mouse. The character interactions in the second half progresses the movie steadily and there is never a irrelevant segment. In terms of plot, the writer (Nick Viltues) has accomplished some good writing but many criticised the movie for it's lack of character depth and even for it's climax. In my opinion only on a re watch the movie's real quality can be appreciated. If one views the movie with concentration and focus, he/she will realise that the u.s.p of the movie is in the performances and dialogues. 'Blood and wine' is not a classic but truly a milestone for introducing the noir genre in to the nineties. Later movies like 'U Turn' and 'Lost Highway' followed. SPOILERS AHEAD Nicholson plays a wine merchant who is having a bitter relationship with his wife (Davis) and son (Dorff). His neglecting attitude has created a rift in relations in the household. He and Caine who plays a ageing safe-cracker on parole plan to steal a expensive necklace from the a rich family's residence while they are on vacation. They aim to achieve to do this with the help of a maid played by (Lopez). On the day they plan to steal they discover the maid has lost her job, however with a little inconvenience the pair still manage to get their hands on the necklace. Nicholson plans to travel to New York to sale it for a good price. He books a flight with Lopez who he is having an affair with. Unfortunately his wife discovers this which leads to a brawl and Nicholson becomes unconscious. Dorff arrives on the scene and him and his mother escape. Later Nicholson awakes and finds out that they took the suitcase that the necklace was hidden in. Him and Caine try to locate the mother and son but a high speed pursuit turns nasty which leads to the death of Dorff's mother. After this Dorff decides to get revenge with genius methods. He pits Caine against Nicholson and attempts to lure Nicholson with the necklace with the aid of Lopez. END OF SPOILERS For a small thriller the movie extracts brilliant performances from all involved. This element is the core of the movie and brings out life from a routine script. Plot twists are at a minimum however this does not deters ones' enjoyment from the movie. Every clever surprising plot development that occurs happens to the viewer's attention. Bob Rafelson's direction is standard and is in tone with the movies theme. Many close up shots of the character's faces are mesmerising. It captures feelings and emotions very realistically. Florida has become a common setting for movies of this nature. Body Heat, Palmetto and Wild things too used this location. This is another highlight for the movie but many scenes are shot indoors so outdoor scenery is restricted to a certain extent. The background score is very thin. It is not used at every point. Music is incorporated at moments when it can feel most effective with the scene. This was the first time pairing of Micheal Caine and Jack Nicholson. They are legends in their own right and make the movie worthy of watching whenever they appear on screen together. Their interactions and witticism are a highlight in the movie. Nicholson impresses in a negative role. This is something that he very renowned for. Stephen Dorff is commendable in the second half as his involvement is greater. He was an upcoming star and his facial and emotional expressions are on the mark. Jennifer Lopez was at the early stages of her career with this small role but her role serves it's purpose at the very end. Her Cuban accent attempt is was very charming. For those that enjoy cinema with a distinctive noir taste, this is highly recommended as performances are impressive.

    With the talent on board, Jack Nicholson, Michael Cane, Jennifer Lopez, and Stephen Dorff, "Blood and Wine" must be regarded as a misfire. The film seems strangely detached, with no real involvement for the audience. Jennife Lopez especially comes across as if she wasn't sure how to present herself. What you get are domestic disputes, disappearing diamonds, and disagreements among thieves, none of which are particularly interesting. Even the heist is depicted as an afterthought. With no likable characters, a script that seems underdeveloped, and little reason for the viewer to care about any of this, everything just sort of drifts along to nowhere. - MERK

    A terrific cast consisting of Jack Nicholson, Michael Caine, Judy Davis, Steven Dorff, and Jennifer Lopez star in "Blood & Wine," a 1996 film noir directed by Bob Rafelson. Nicholson is a wine dealer in a bad marriage with Judy Davis. He and a partner, Victor (Michael Caine) steal a diamond necklace. Nicholson's wife wants to catch him cheating on her, but what she interrupts is his trip to pawn the necklace. Things go bad from there. Despite the great cast and strong direction, this noir doesn't quite hang together. The talent is there, so perhaps the script could have been stronger. It does hold one's interest, however, and some nice twists. It's downbeat for sure, with flawed characters. Not quite up to Nicholson-Rafelson collaborations of the past, but okay.

    'Blood and Wine' has a sort of film noire feel to it. It reminds one of the Humphrey Bogart and Alfred Hitchcock classics. Though it's not as stylish a film Rafelson does make good use of the Florida locations. Some of the dialogues are interesting too. The element of suspense is well maintained but what really works for 'Blood and Wine' is the unusual cast. Jack Nicholson is not very different from his other films but it suits Alex Gates. Michael Caine is a knockout as the murderer with a bad cold. He's quite the scene-stealer. Judy Davis is first rate. Stephen Dorff plays holds his own. Jennifer Lopez is stunning. What is most striking is her natural beauty combined with a natural performance. She more than holds her own and brings a certain humanness and courage to an otherwise fragile Gabriella. Overall, Rafelson's is an intriguing little thriller with a fantastic cast.

    The story involves the theft of a multi-million-dollar necklace by thieves Jack Nicholson, who runs a wine shop in Miami, and Michael Caine, a safe cracker on parole. Nicholson packs his suitcase intending to leave his wife, Judy Davis, and his stepson, Steven Dorff, and run off to New York with his innocent girl friend, Jennifer Lopez. In New York, he intends to sell the hot ice to a fence and return to split the cash with Caine. At the last moment, Nicholson has an argument with his wife, she clobbers him with a poker, frantically throws some clothes into Nicholson's suitcase, and drives off with her son. The necklace is stashed in a compartment of the suitcase, although neither she nor Dorff knows it. They find out soon enough. Nicholson and Caine track them to Key Largo and there are arguments, fights, a car chase, until Davis and Caine wind up dead, Dorff takes off in his new boat for the horizon, Lopez drives off alone with one of the stones, and Nicholson winds up in the hands of the law. It has a lot going for it. Nicholson and Caine rarely go wrong. Judy Davis does hysteria well. Jennifer Lopez is a natural actress, a beautiful young woman with a cantilevered rear end. The locations include some of the more colorful parts of Florida. And there's one effective action scene during, and immediately after, the car chase. So why doesn't it work any better than it does? It's a mean-spirited movie. Every character seems greedy, spiteful, and deceitful. There's nobody to root for. It's easy to argue that this is rather more like real life than having good and evil splashed across the screen, but the values don't go much beyond that. No one has any particularly generous impulses. If someone dies, they simply disappear from the story. The only scene in which a genuine conflict of motives appears is when Nicholson is rooting around the bloodied body of his dying wife in an overturned car, searching desperately for the stupid necklace and sobbing with remorse at the same time. And even this is undercut by pettiness. Her last words to Nicholson: "**** you." The ill-considered roles cripple the performances too.
