    Black Sheep The hardest part of life on the campaign trail for most candidates must be keeping themselves from forcing the media bus into a ravine. However that scene is a possibility with the simpleton sibling of a governor hopeful in this comedy. To keep his blundering brother Mike (Chris Farley) from ruining his candidacy, Al (Tim Matheson) assigns low-level aide Steve (David Spade) to baby-sit him on his canvassing duties. Meanwhile the incumbent Governor Tracy (Christine Ebersole) releases photos implementing Mike in an arson case. Costing his brother the election, Mike makes amends by discovering inconsistencies in Tracy's vote count. A feeble attempt to build on Spade and Farley's comedic chemistry, Black Sheep fails to capture their previous magic: the characters are hollow, the script is clich&eacute;d and the jokes are abysmal. Besides, every politician already knows to simply appoint any possibly embarrassing relatives to the position of official food taster. (Red Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

    Starring Chris Farley and David Spade, "Black Sheep" is yet another SNL-like comedy produced by creator Lorne Michaels. The movie starts with Mike Donnelly, portrayed by Chris Farley, whose brother is running for governor of Washington, but it turns out that his crazy shenanigans is ruining the campaign. So his brother sends out his personal assistant, portrayed by David Spade, to help keep Mike under control before the big campaign. "Black Sheep" is not a sequel to "Tommy Boy", even though they are both produced by Lorne Michaels, and they both have a special SNL quality to it, and the duo of Chris Farley and David Spade are back, only they are in different roles this time. This movie does have the same formula, but even if it's funny and enjoying, this is not as good as it's previous competition. It was glad to see Farley and Spade back on screen together after they previously worked with each other on "Tommy Boy". They are still wacky and funny like always, and it was really nice to see these two maniacs on screen. But neither one of them brings a unique or really good performance. But I would rather like to see these guys bullying each other, and bond with one quick one-liner after another, like in "Tommy Boy". But they don't accomplish that this time. I did laugh out loud at times, but it was just until later in the movie where almost everything becomes less funny. But let's not forget that Gary Busey, with two horrible-looking buck front teeth, makes an appearance in this movie, and it's just flat-out-weird. "Black Sheep" may be considered as one of the 90s worst movies to others. But I knew what I wanted to see, and I enjoyed another SNL Farley-Spade duo motion picture. "Black Sheep", in my review, "completely untraditional, but somewhat hilarious".

    'Black Sheep' is a decent comedy from the 1990's, that offers laughter here and there. But, the main reason why I really enjoyed this film was - The Great Chris Farley. In the lead role, the late legend delivers a lovable performance, that only goes onto to say, what a talent he was! 'Black Sheep' Synopsis: A gubernatorial candidate hires a wormy special assistant whose only job is to make sure the candidate's well-meaning but incompetent brother doesn't ruin the election. Fred Wolf's Screenplay is funny in parts. However, the writing could've been tighter & more cohesive. Penelope Spheeris Directs this Light-Hearted Comedy, ably. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are ordinary. Performance-Wise: It's Farley all the way. He delivers, as mentioned, a lovable performance. Also, he suits the role perfectly. David Spade contributes nicely in some sequences. Tim Matheson is perfect. Christine Ebersole is fair. Gary Busey & Grant Heslov are as usual. On the whole, 'Black Sheep' is a decent comedy, with Farley ruling the show.

    Black Sheep reminds us of Tommy Boy, another Farley and Spade comedy, released in 1995 and inevitably suffers by comparison. While continuing to elaborate and put emphasis on Farley and Spade's impressive chemistry, the film lacks the fun and adventures had by both the men in Tommy Boy. This is another entry in the "maximum antics, minimum laughter" genre of comedy where a film gets to caught up in over-the-top, slapsticky antics that it forgets in order to be acceptable they have to be funny. Somehow, that just doesn't register with Black Sheep. It continues the same tired antics we saw previously in Tommy Boy. Some of the funniest scenes are when Chris Farley and David Spade are just having a calm talk, but with Farley's persona you can tell how rare those moments are. The story seems to have tried its absolute hardest to distance itself from the formula of Tommy Boy, but it doesn't completely. Mike Donnelly (Farley) is the brother of Al Donnelly (Matheson), who is running for governor of Washington. Mike is told to help campaign for Al, but as you can expect, he can't stop running into goofy situations. Not to mention, Mike keeps finding ways to get into trouble by either getting his picture taken near a recreational center fire or holding a beer and a marijuana joint, further jeopardizing his brother's plans of winning. To prevent any mishaps from his brother, Al hires Steve Dodds (Spade), a giddy man hoping to take a place on Al's staff after the election. Mike and Steve then go out to a remote cabin in the middle of nowhere, and, do I even need to continue? Penelope Spheeris, who directed Wayne's World, doesn't provide the same care and attention to Black Sheep as she did that fantastic rock comedy. But it's the writing that fails the film the most. In Tommy Boy (there I go again), the funny thing was David Spade's Richard character was actually smarter and more intellectual than Farley's Tommy character. In Black Sheep, David Spade's Steve acts as an intellectual, when he isn't much sharper than the crayon he he picks on. Black Sheep is cute, but sour in more places that I would've liked. The plot is tired, the antics are rowdy but only a few funny, and no one looks optimistic about the performance of the project. Starring: Chris Farley, David Spade, Tim Matheson, and Gary Busey. Directed by: Penelope Spheeris.

    You need to take this film at face value. It is not trying to be clever. It is simply out and out slap stick routine stretched out through decently scripted film. This films simple premise is to make you laugh. It certainly made me laugh. The over the top jokes, scenarios and pain really brought this to life as a silly belly laughfest. Nice light hearted comedy offering a laugh to all ages. I think a no brainer comedy is a good thing to lift spirits and raise a smile. I cant imagine anyone not finding this film funny in one way or another. If you like the comedy style of Jim Carey and movement of Lee Evans or Rowan Atkinson then I recommend you give this a go. Enjoy

    In his famous TV show, At The Movies, film critic Gene Siskel said that this was the first film he walked out on in 26 years of reviewing movies. Well, maybe he was having intestinal problem at the moment ! When an important critic says that, it doesn't mean necessarily that he's right. Originally, you are the one who can make Siskel's reviews, or else's, look right or not. Because, any film critic is speaking his own mind, not yours. Sometimes it's the same thing. And sometimes it isn't. This time, obviously for me, it isn't ! Simply this is not a bad movie. The word "intolerable" got no relation with it whatsoever. It's a light and sweet slapstick. Nothing is too goofy or too zany. No one showed ridiculous performance. It reminded me with the work of Laurel & Hardy, yet in colors and with somehow thrilling plot. Chris Farley is doing his routine, and the chemistry between him and David Spade is working. The actual problem is that this movie came after (Tommy Boy  1995) which's a better movie. So the disappointment must be powerful. And yes, you've got to ask yourself; why after a comic detailed breakthrough such as (Tommy..) the new dual goes and make something which's clearly not better (or as good) ?! I believe the studio didn't know how to deal with the newly born star. So, they handled him any script just to exploit his success. But that wasn't for the sake of his career, us, and them; since the movie didn't hit the mark as its precedent. The easy plan to invest Farley this time was by the reoccurrence of (Tommy..)'s factors. And sorrowfully Farley accepted it. Therefore some gags from the original (Tommy Boy) were recycled however on a poor level with not much to support it either (the idea of idiot Farley and rational Spade, the problem of their sleep, even David Spade got nothing new to show this round; he was repeating the whole thing yet weakly !). And for some it was hard to believe that the tongue-in-cheek was the movie's main, or only, goods ! Though, Black Sheep isn't really a Black Sheep. It is relaxingly uncomplicated, and has its moments. Just imagine that it was made before (Tommy..) and they had to release it later, and everything will be fine ! I loved its innocent cartoonish sense, its running gags, the character of the old lunatic veteran (Oh God ! So Gary Busey CAN do comedy !! WAW as long as you live, as along as you see and be surprised !) and the whole wacky time of it, where I didn't feel a single second of cheesiness or repulsiveness or bore. Dear late Gene Siskel. I admire many of your opinions. But, you were totally unfair towards this one. 1996 got some of the real agonizing comedies. Kingpin, The Cable Guy, Larger Than Life are little examples. Sometimes the critic, even the ordinary viewer, stands many movies good or bad one after another, to have no patience for more. So walking out on a movie could mean that one critic is being tortured by one movie. Or that one critic just, for a reason out of the movie, can't have a good time.

    Chris Farley portrayed likable, stoner humor, as in Tommy Boy. This time It's Mike Donnelly (Chris Farley) and Steve Dodds (David Spade) this is better, simply because David Spade's character wasn't so mean or razor sharp sarcastic, like in Tommy Boy. It is set in Washington, where I used to live. Tommy Boy was a virtual remake of Planes, Trains and Automobiles, and instead of the brutally sarcastic David Spade, sarcastic at times, the movie has mostly physical humor and "butt-head humor". More like Laurel and Hardy trying to straighten out corruption in the state election, as he is a target who is set up to ruin his brother's election, and Gary Busey plays a weapon crazy, backwoods war monger, who is a bad guy until near the end of the movie when he is impressed with Mike's combat moves when he saved Steve from being murdered, and he becomes their sort of ally in further action. The type of stupid humor we see include the temporary house in the wilderness losing its roof with a storm following hail and Mike on the top bunk crashes down on Steve. The Fridge slides towards the door and crashes into Mike and he thinks he got pudding in his pants, only there wasn't any in the fridge, possible toilet humor and Mike at an MTV election promotion getting stoned with reefers and protesting on live TV almost ruining his brother. David Spade, is actually funny when he's not sarcastic, such as when the bursting nitro booster gets them high while driving a police car.

    I have been reading some of the comments about the movie "Black Sheep" that people have put up, praising this movie and saying that its funny and Good for civics classes and after careful deliberation I am forced to the conclusion to ask anyone that thinks along these lines, as delicately and dispasionately as possible....You can not be serious. Black Sheep was one of the worst so-called comedies I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing! Let me set you guys straight. Nothing, Repeat, NOTHING funny came out of this movie. The jokes were stale as two week old bread, the directing was uneven and cockeyed, the writing was painfully inept, and the performances, if you can call them that, were a complete waste of time. David Spade is dull and uninteresting as the campaign manager assistant, or whatever he was, to the point were he just seems to standing around in a stupor of some kind. Tim Matheson and The rest of the cast bring absolutely nothing to the table. However, I have saved the Worst for last, Chris Farley. Oh..My...GAAAWWWDD!!!! His acting, If you can call it that, is so over-the-top, overdone, overwrought, overacted, overweight, that it boggles the mind. Now, I now Farley whole shtick on SNL and in his movies his his wild, boisterous personality and to be fair, It worked, to a certain degree in his other movies like "Tommy Boy". However, Tommy Boy, was Oscar worthy material compared to this Craptacular eye-sore of a movie. Here he is not funny at all, he is not even acting bad enough to make fun of! It gets real old real fast and you start to get more and more angry at his ridiculous outbursts. One final observation, There was a point in the movie where they go up to a cabin in the woods were presumably, Comedic Wackieness will ensue, It doesn't. In fact, I actually wondered if the writers had a brief moment of clarity and realized the disaster they were creating and went on strike. So the director and actors tried to improvise around the cabin scenario. In any event, The point in the movie showed, the utter desperation these performers must have been feeling. I say they new what they were doing, but either they didn't know how to salvage it or they just didn't care. Shame on all of them.

    Chris Farley, the man who brought so many laughs with his physical comedy, made a lot of people laugh. And this movie is no different. Instead of Farley working to save his dad'd company with David Spade, he is working to save his brother's campaign with David Spade. Lots of memorable moments with the squad car, the TV trucks, holding Spade hostage, fighting Gary Busey - it just goes on. Sometimes the jokes relied entirely on the response of Farley, which was usually good. But other moments, like at the end with the plane, the joke got a little old and less funny. Overall, I say that the movie is positive. So have a go with Farley. "B+"

    I recently showed Black Sheep to my AP Government Class. Not only did they love it they learned a lot of valuable information about the American Political system. I would highly recommend that Mrs. Knapp show this movie to her AP Government Classes. I have always been a fan of the late Chris Farley and David Spade. This is just another great example of great comedy. As a Doctor in Political Science and a 15 year career in teaching, I can not recommend this movie highly enough. What I am pretty much saying is that it would be really cool if we could watch this movie. And by really cool, I mean really really cool. Go Packers, Go Jeans, Go Farve!

    Chris Farley portrayed likable, stoner humor, as in Tommy Boy. This time It's Mike Donnelly (Chris Farley) and Steve Dodds (David Spade) this is better, simply because David Spade's character wasn't so mean or razor sharp sarcastic, like in Tommy Boy. It is set in Washington, where I used to live. Tommy Boy was a virtual remake of Planes, Trains and Automobiles, and instead of the brutally sarcastic David Spade, sarcastic at times, the movie has mostly physical humor and "butt-head humor". More like Laurel and Hardy trying to straighten out corruption in the state election, as he is a target who is set up to ruin his brother's election, and Gary Busey plays a weapon crazy, backwoods war monger, who is a bad guy until near the end of the movie when he is impressed with Mike's combat moves when he saved Steve from being murdered, and he becomes their sort of ally in further action. The type of stupid humor we see include the temporary house in the wilderness losing its roof with a storm following hail and Mike on the top bunk crashes down on Steve. The Fridge slides towards the door and crashes into Mike and he thinks he got pudding in his pants, only there wasn't any in the fridge, possible toilet humor and Mike at an MTV election promotion getting stoned with reefers and protesting on live TV almost ruining his brother. David Spade, is actually funny when he's not sarcastic, such as when the bursting nitro booster gets them high while driving a police car.

    I have been reading some of the comments about the movie "Black Sheep" that people have put up, praising this movie and saying that its funny and Good for civics classes and after careful deliberation I am forced to the conclusion to ask anyone that thinks along these lines, as delicately and dispasionately as possible....You can not be serious. Black Sheep was one of the worst so-called comedies I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing! Let me set you guys straight. Nothing, Repeat, NOTHING funny came out of this movie. The jokes were stale as two week old bread, the directing was uneven and cockeyed, the writing was painfully inept, and the performances, if you can call them that, were a complete waste of time. David Spade is dull and uninteresting as the campaign manager assistant, or whatever he was, to the point were he just seems to standing around in a stupor of some kind. Tim Matheson and The rest of the cast bring absolutely nothing to the table. However, I have saved the Worst for last, Chris Farley. Oh..My...GAAAWWWDD!!!! His acting, If you can call it that, is so over-the-top, overdone, overwrought, overacted, overweight, that it boggles the mind. Now, I now Farley whole shtick on SNL and in his movies his his wild, boisterous personality and to be fair, It worked, to a certain degree in his other movies like "Tommy Boy". However, Tommy Boy, was Oscar worthy material compared to this Craptacular eye-sore of a movie. Here he is not funny at all, he is not even acting bad enough to make fun of! It gets real old real fast and you start to get more and more angry at his ridiculous outbursts. One final observation, There was a point in the movie where they go up to a cabin in the woods were presumably, Comedic Wackieness will ensue, It doesn't. In fact, I actually wondered if the writers had a brief moment of clarity and realized the disaster they were creating and went on strike. So the director and actors tried to improvise around the cabin scenario. In any event, The point in the movie showed, the utter desperation these performers must have been feeling. I say they new what they were doing, but either they didn't know how to salvage it or they just didn't care. Shame on all of them.

    Chris Farley, the man who brought so many laughs with his physical comedy, made a lot of people laugh. And this movie is no different. Instead of Farley working to save his dad'd company with David Spade, he is working to save his brother's campaign with David Spade. Lots of memorable moments with the squad car, the TV trucks, holding Spade hostage, fighting Gary Busey - it just goes on. Sometimes the jokes relied entirely on the response of Farley, which was usually good. But other moments, like at the end with the plane, the joke got a little old and less funny. Overall, I say that the movie is positive. So have a go with Farley. "B+"

    I recently showed Black Sheep to my AP Government Class. Not only did they love it they learned a lot of valuable information about the American Political system. I would highly recommend that Mrs. Knapp show this movie to her AP Government Classes. I have always been a fan of the late Chris Farley and David Spade. This is just another great example of great comedy. As a Doctor in Political Science and a 15 year career in teaching, I can not recommend this movie highly enough. What I am pretty much saying is that it would be really cool if we could watch this movie. And by really cool, I mean really really cool. Go Packers, Go Jeans, Go Farve! Sincerely, Dr. Evan M Hanchett: PhD in Political Science

    Black Sheep The hardest part of life on the campaign trail for most candidates must be keeping themselves from forcing the media bus into a ravine. However that scene is a possibility with the simpleton sibling of a governor hopeful in this comedy. To keep his blundering brother Mike (Chris Farley) from ruining his candidacy, Al (Tim Matheson) assigns low-level aide Steve (David Spade) to baby-sit him on his canvassing duties. Meanwhile the incumbent Governor Tracy (Christine Ebersole) releases photos implementing Mike in an arson case. Costing his brother the election, Mike makes amends by discovering inconsistencies in Tracy's vote count. A feeble attempt to build on Spade and Farley's comedic chemistry, Black Sheep fails to capture their previous magic: the characters are hollow, the script is clich&eacute;d and the jokes are abysmal. Besides, every politician already knows to simply appoint any possibly embarrassing relatives to the position of official food taster. (Red Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

    Starring Chris Farley and David Spade, "Black Sheep" is yet another SNL-like comedy produced by creator Lorne Michaels. The movie starts with Mike Donnelly, portrayed by Chris Farley, whose brother is running for governor of Washington, but it turns out that his crazy shenanigans is ruining the campaign. So his brother sends out his personal assistant, portrayed by David Spade, to help keep Mike under control before the big campaign. "Black Sheep" is not a sequel to "Tommy Boy", even though they are both produced by Lorne Michaels, and they both have a special SNL quality to it, and the duo of Chris Farley and David Spade are back, only they are in different roles this time. This movie does have the same formula, but even if it's funny and enjoying, this is not as good as it's previous competition. It was glad to see Farley and Spade back on screen together after they previously worked with each other on "Tommy Boy". They are still wacky and funny like always, and it was really nice to see these two maniacs on screen. But neither one of them brings a unique or really good performance. But I would rather like to see these guys bullying each other, and bond with one quick one-liner after another, like in "Tommy Boy". But they don't accomplish that this time. I did laugh out loud at times, but it was just until later in the movie where almost everything becomes less funny. But let's not forget that Gary Busey, with two horrible-looking buck front teeth, makes an appearance in this movie, and it's just flat-out-weird. "Black Sheep" may be considered as one of the 90s worst movies to others. But I knew what I wanted to see, and I enjoyed another SNL Farley-Spade duo motion picture. "Black Sheep", in my review, "completely untraditional, but somewhat hilarious".

    'Black Sheep' is a decent comedy from the 1990's, that offers laughter here and there. But, the main reason why I really enjoyed this film was - The Great Chris Farley. In the lead role, the late legend delivers a lovable performance, that only goes onto to say, what a talent he was! 'Black Sheep' Synopsis: A gubernatorial candidate hires a wormy special assistant whose only job is to make sure the candidate's well-meaning but incompetent brother doesn't ruin the election. Fred Wolf's Screenplay is funny in parts. However, the writing could've been tighter & more cohesive. Penelope Spheeris Directs this Light-Hearted Comedy, ably. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are ordinary. Performance-Wise: It's Farley all the way. He delivers, as mentioned, a lovable performance. Also, he suits the role perfectly. David Spade contributes nicely in some sequences. Tim Matheson is perfect. Christine Ebersole is fair. Gary Busey & Grant Heslov are as usual. On the whole, 'Black Sheep' is a decent comedy, with Farley ruling the show.

    Black Sheep reminds us of Tommy Boy, another Farley and Spade comedy, released in 1995 and inevitably suffers by comparison. While continuing to elaborate and put emphasis on Farley and Spade's impressive chemistry, the film lacks the fun and adventures had by both the men in Tommy Boy. This is another entry in the "maximum antics, minimum laughter" genre of comedy where a film gets to caught up in over-the-top, slapsticky antics that it forgets in order to be acceptable they have to be funny. Somehow, that just doesn't register with Black Sheep. It continues the same tired antics we saw previously in Tommy Boy. Some of the funniest scenes are when Chris Farley and David Spade are just having a calm talk, but with Farley's persona you can tell how rare those moments are. The story seems to have tried its absolute hardest to distance itself from the formula of Tommy Boy, but it doesn't completely. Mike Donnelly (Farley) is the brother of Al Donnelly (Matheson), who is running for governor of Washington. Mike is told to help campaign for Al, but as you can expect, he can't stop running into goofy situations. Not to mention, Mike keeps finding ways to get into trouble by either getting his picture taken near a recreational center fire or holding a beer and a marijuana joint, further jeopardizing his brother's plans of winning. To prevent any mishaps from his brother, Al hires Steve Dodds (Spade), a giddy man hoping to take a place on Al's staff after the election. Mike and Steve then go out to a remote cabin in the middle of nowhere, and, do I even need to continue? Penelope Spheeris, who directed Wayne's World, doesn't provide the same care and attention to Black Sheep as she did that fantastic rock comedy. But it's the writing that fails the film the most. In Tommy Boy (there I go again), the funny thing was David Spade's Richard character was actually smarter and more intellectual than Farley's Tommy character. In Black Sheep, David Spade's Steve acts as an intellectual, when he isn't much sharper than the crayon he he picks on. Black Sheep is cute, but sour in more places that I would've liked. The plot is tired, the antics are rowdy but only a few funny, and no one looks optimistic about the performance of the project. Starring: Chris Farley, David Spade, Tim Matheson, and Gary Busey. Directed by: Penelope Spheeris.

    You need to take this film at face value. It is not trying to be clever. It is simply out and out slap stick routine stretched out through decently scripted film. This films simple premise is to make you laugh. It certainly made me laugh. The over the top jokes, scenarios and pain really brought this to life as a silly belly laughfest. Nice light hearted comedy offering a laugh to all ages. I think a no brainer comedy is a good thing to lift spirits and raise a smile. I cant imagine anyone not finding this film funny in one way or another. If you like the comedy style of Jim Carey and movement of Lee Evans or Rowan Atkinson then I recommend you give this a go. Enjoy

    In his famous TV show, At The Movies, film critic Gene Siskel said that this was the first film he walked out on in 26 years of reviewing movies. Well, maybe he was having intestinal problem at the moment ! When an important critic says that, it doesn't mean necessarily that he's right. Originally, you are the one who can make Siskel's reviews, or else's, look right or not. Because, any film critic is speaking his own mind, not yours. Sometimes it's the same thing. And sometimes it isn't. This time, obviously for me, it isn't ! Simply this is not a bad movie. The word "intolerable" got no relation with it whatsoever. It's a light and sweet slapstick. Nothing is too goofy or too zany. No one showed ridiculous performance. It reminded me with the work of Laurel & Hardy, yet in colors and with somehow thrilling plot. Chris Farley is doing his routine, and the chemistry between him and David Spade is working. The actual problem is that this movie came after (Tommy Boy  1995) which's a better movie. So the disappointment must be powerful. And yes, you've got to ask yourself; why after a comic detailed breakthrough such as (Tommy..) the new dual goes and make something which's clearly not better (or as good) ?! I believe the studio didn't know how to deal with the newly born star. So, they handled him any script just to exploit his success. But that wasn't for the sake of his career, us, and them; since the movie didn't hit the mark as its precedent. The easy plan to invest Farley this time was by the reoccurrence of (Tommy..)'s factors. And sorrowfully Farley accepted it. Therefore some gags from the original (Tommy Boy) were recycled however on a poor level with not much to support it either (the idea of idiot Farley and rational Spade, the problem of their sleep, even David Spade got nothing new to show this round; he was repeating the whole thing yet weakly !). And for some it was hard to believe that the tongue-in-cheek was the movie's main, or only, goods ! Though, Black Sheep isn't really a Black Sheep. It is relaxingly uncomplicated, and has its moments. Just imagine that it was made before (Tommy..) and they had to release it later, and everything will be fine ! I loved its innocent cartoonish sense, its running gags, the character of the old lunatic veteran (Oh God ! So Gary Busey CAN do comedy !! WAW as long as you live, as along as you see and be surprised !) and the whole wacky time of it, where I didn't feel a single second of cheesiness or repulsiveness or bore. Dear late Gene Siskel. I admire many of your opinions. But, you were totally unfair towards this one. 1996 got some of the real agonizing comedies. Kingpin, The Cable Guy, Larger Than Life are little examples. Sometimes the critic, even the ordinary viewer, stands many movies good or bad one after another, to have no patience for more. So walking out on a movie could mean that one critic is being tortured by one movie. Or that one critic just, for a reason out of the movie, can't have a good time.

    You need to take this film at face value. It is not trying to be clever. It is simply out and out slap stick routine stretched out through decently scripted film. This films simple premise is to make you laugh. It certainly made me laugh. The over the top jokes, scenarios and pain really brought this to life as a silly belly laughfest. Nice light hearted comedy offering a laugh to all ages. I think a no brainer comedy is a good thing to lift spirits and raise a smile. I cant imagine anyone not finding this film funny in one way or another. If you like the comedy style of Jim Carey and movement of Lee Evans or Rowan Atkinson then I recommend you give this a go. Enjoy

    In his famous TV show, At The Movies, film critic Gene Siskel said that this was the first film he walked out on in 26 years of reviewing movies. Well, maybe he was having intestinal problem at the moment ! When an important critic says that, it doesn't mean necessarily that he's right. Originally, you are the one who can make Siskel's reviews, or else's, look right or not. Because, any film critic is speaking his own mind, not yours. Sometimes it's the same thing. And sometimes it isn't. This time, obviously for me, it isn't ! Simply this is not a bad movie. The word "intolerable" got no relation with it whatsoever. It's a light and sweet slapstick. Nothing is too goofy or too zany. No one showed ridiculous performance. It reminded me with the work of Laurel & Hardy, yet in colors and with somehow thrilling plot. Chris Farley is doing his routine, and the chemistry between him and David Spade is working. The actual problem is that this movie came after (Tommy Boy  1995) which's a better movie. So the disappointment must be powerful. And yes, you've got to ask yourself; why after a comic detailed breakthrough such as (Tommy..) the new dual goes and make something which's clearly not better (or as good) ?! I believe the studio didn't know how to deal with the newly born star. So, they handled him any script just to exploit his success. But that wasn't for the sake of his career, us, and them; since the movie didn't hit the mark as its precedent. The easy plan to invest Farley this time was by the reoccurrence of (Tommy..)'s factors. And sorrowfully Farley accepted it. Therefore some gags from the original (Tommy Boy) were recycled however on a poor level with not much to support it either (the idea of idiot Farley and rational Spade, the problem of their sleep, even David Spade got nothing new to show this round; he was repeating the whole thing yet weakly !). And for some it was hard to believe that the tongue-in-cheek was the movie's main, or only, goods ! Though, Black Sheep isn't really a Black Sheep. It is relaxingly uncomplicated, and has its moments. Just imagine that it was made before (Tommy..) and they had to release it later, and everything will be fine ! I loved its innocent cartoonish sense, its running gags, the character of the old lunatic veteran (Oh God ! So Gary Busey CAN do comedy !! WAW as long as you live, as along as you see and be surprised !) and the whole wacky time of it, where I didn't feel a single second of cheesiness or repulsiveness or bore. Dear late Gene Siskel. I admire many of your opinions. But, you were totally unfair towards this one. 1996 got some of the real agonizing comedies. Kingpin, The Cable Guy, Larger Than Life are little examples. Sometimes the critic, even the ordinary viewer, stands many movies good or bad one after another, to have no patience for more. So walking out on a movie could mean that one critic is being tortured by one movie. Or that one critic just, for a reason out of the movie, can't have a good time.

    Chris Farley portrayed likable, stoner humor, as in Tommy Boy. This time It's Mike Donnelly (Chris Farley) and Steve Dodds (David Spade) this is better, simply because David Spade's character wasn't so mean or razor sharp sarcastic, like in Tommy Boy. It is set in Washington, where I used to live. Tommy Boy was a virtual remake of Planes, Trains and Automobiles, and instead of the brutally sarcastic David Spade, sarcastic at times, the movie has mostly physical humor and "butt-head humor". More like Laurel and Hardy trying to straighten out corruption in the state election, as he is a target who is set up to ruin his brother's election, and Gary Busey plays a weapon crazy, backwoods war monger, who is a bad guy until near the end of the movie when he is impressed with Mike's combat moves when he saved Steve from being murdered, and he becomes their sort of ally in further action. The type of stupid humor we see include the temporary house in the wilderness losing its roof with a storm following hail and Mike on the top bunk crashes down on Steve. The Fridge slides towards the door and crashes into Mike and he thinks he got pudding in his pants, only there wasn't any in the fridge, possible toilet humor and Mike at an MTV election promotion getting stoned with reefers and protesting on live TV almost ruining his brother. David Spade, is actually funny when he's not sarcastic, such as when the bursting nitro booster gets them high while driving a police car.

    I have been reading some of the comments about the movie "Black Sheep" that people have put up, praising this movie and saying that its funny and Good for civics classes and after careful deliberation I am forced to the conclusion to ask anyone that thinks along these lines, as delicately and dispasionately as possible....You can not be serious. Black Sheep was one of the worst so-called comedies I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing! Let me set you guys straight. Nothing, Repeat, NOTHING funny came out of this movie. The jokes were stale as two week old bread, the directing was uneven and cockeyed, the writing was painfully inept, and the performances, if you can call them that, were a complete waste of time. David Spade is dull and uninteresting as the campaign manager assistant, or whatever he was, to the point were he just seems to standing around in a stupor of some kind. Tim Matheson and The rest of the cast bring absolutely nothing to the table. However, I have saved the Worst for last, Chris Farley. Oh..My...GAAAWWWDD!!!! His acting, If you can call it that, is so over-the-top, overdone, overwrought, overacted, overweight, that it boggles the mind. Now, I now Farley whole shtick on SNL and in his movies his his wild, boisterous personality and to be fair, It worked, to a certain degree in his other movies like "Tommy Boy". However, Tommy Boy, was Oscar worthy material compared to this Craptacular eye-sore of a movie. Here he is not funny at all, he is not even acting bad enough to make fun of! It gets real old real fast and you start to get more and more angry at his ridiculous outbursts. One final observation, There was a point in the movie where they go up to a cabin in the woods were presumably, Comedic Wackieness will ensue, It doesn't. In fact, I actually wondered if the writers had a brief moment of clarity and realized the disaster they were creating and went on strike. So the director and actors tried to improvise around the cabin scenario. In any event, The point in the movie showed, the utter desperation these performers must have been feeling. I say they new what they were doing, but either they didn't know how to salvage it or they just didn't care. Shame on all of them.

    Chris Farley, the man who brought so many laughs with his physical comedy, made a lot of people laugh. And this movie is no different. Instead of Farley working to save his dad'd company with David Spade, he is working to save his brother's campaign with David Spade. Lots of memorable moments with the squad car, the TV trucks, holding Spade hostage, fighting Gary Busey - it just goes on. Sometimes the jokes relied entirely on the response of Farley, which was usually good. But other moments, like at the end with the plane, the joke got a little old and less funny. Overall, I say that the movie is positive. So have a go with Farley. "B+"

    I recently showed Black Sheep to my AP Government Class. Not only did they love it they learned a lot of valuable information about the American Political system. I would highly recommend that Mrs. Knapp show this movie to her AP Government Classes. I have always been a fan of the late Chris Farley and David Spade. This is just another great example of great comedy. As a Doctor in Political Science and a 15 year career in teaching, I can not recommend this movie highly enough. What I am pretty much saying is that it would be really cool if we could watch this movie. And by really cool, I mean really really cool. Go Packers, Go Jeans, Go Farve!

    Black Sheep The hardest part of life on the campaign trail for most candidates must be keeping themselves from forcing the media bus into a ravine. However that scene is a possibility with the simpleton sibling of a governor hopeful in this comedy. To keep his blundering brother Mike (Chris Farley) from ruining his candidacy, Al (Tim Matheson) assigns low-level aide Steve (David Spade) to baby-sit him on his canvassing duties. Meanwhile the incumbent Governor Tracy (Christine Ebersole) releases photos implementing Mike in an arson case. Costing his brother the election, Mike makes amends by discovering inconsistencies in Tracy's vote count. A feeble attempt to build on Spade and Farley's comedic chemistry, Black Sheep fails to capture their previous magic: the characters are hollow, the script is clich&eacute;d and the jokes are abysmal. Besides, every politician already knows to simply appoint any possibly embarrassing relatives to the position of official food taster. (Red Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

    Starring Chris Farley and David Spade, "Black Sheep" is yet another SNL-like comedy produced by creator Lorne Michaels. The movie starts with Mike Donnelly, portrayed by Chris Farley, whose brother is running for governor of Washington, but it turns out that his crazy shenanigans is ruining the campaign. So his brother sends out his personal assistant, portrayed by David Spade, to help keep Mike under control before the big campaign. "Black Sheep" is not a sequel to "Tommy Boy", even though they are both produced by Lorne Michaels, and they both have a special SNL quality to it, and the duo of Chris Farley and David Spade are back, only they are in different roles this time. This movie does have the same formula, but even if it's funny and enjoying, this is not as good as it's previous competition. It was glad to see Farley and Spade back on screen together after they previously worked with each other on "Tommy Boy". They are still wacky and funny like always, and it was really nice to see these two maniacs on screen. But neither one of them brings a unique or really good performance. But I would rather like to see these guys bullying each other, and bond with one quick one-liner after another, like in "Tommy Boy". But they don't accomplish that this time. I did laugh out loud at times, but it was just until later in the movie where almost everything becomes less funny. But let's not forget that Gary Busey, with two horrible-looking buck front teeth, makes an appearance in this movie, and it's just flat-out-weird. "Black Sheep" may be considered as one of the 90s worst movies to others. But I knew what I wanted to see, and I enjoyed another SNL Farley-Spade duo motion picture. "Black Sheep", in my review, "completely untraditional, but somewhat hilarious".

    'Black Sheep' is a decent comedy from the 1990's, that offers laughter here and there. But, the main reason why I really enjoyed this film was - The Great Chris Farley. In the lead role, the late legend delivers a lovable performance, that only goes onto to say, what a talent he was! 'Black Sheep' Synopsis: A gubernatorial candidate hires a wormy special assistant whose only job is to make sure the candidate's well-meaning but incompetent brother doesn't ruin the election. Fred Wolf's Screenplay is funny in parts. However, the writing could've been tighter & more cohesive. Penelope Spheeris Directs this Light-Hearted Comedy, ably. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are ordinary. Performance-Wise: It's Farley all the way. He delivers, as mentioned, a lovable performance. Also, he suits the role perfectly. David Spade contributes nicely in some sequences. Tim Matheson is perfect. Christine Ebersole is fair. Gary Busey & Grant Heslov are as usual. On the whole, 'Black Sheep' is a decent comedy, with Farley ruling the show.

    Black Sheep reminds us of Tommy Boy, another Farley and Spade comedy, released in 1995 and inevitably suffers by comparison. While continuing to elaborate and put emphasis on Farley and Spade's impressive chemistry, the film lacks the fun and adventures had by both the men in Tommy Boy. This is another entry in the "maximum antics, minimum laughter" genre of comedy where a film gets to caught up in over-the-top, slapsticky antics that it forgets in order to be acceptable they have to be funny. Somehow, that just doesn't register with Black Sheep. It continues the same tired antics we saw previously in Tommy Boy. Some of the funniest scenes are when Chris Farley and David Spade are just having a calm talk, but with Farley's persona you can tell how rare those moments are. The story seems to have tried its absolute hardest to distance itself from the formula of Tommy Boy, but it doesn't completely. Mike Donnelly (Farley) is the brother of Al Donnelly (Matheson), who is running for governor of Washington. Mike is told to help campaign for Al, but as you can expect, he can't stop running into goofy situations. Not to mention, Mike keeps finding ways to get into trouble by either getting his picture taken near a recreational center fire or holding a beer and a marijuana joint, further jeopardizing his brother's plans of winning. To prevent any mishaps from his brother, Al hires Steve Dodds (Spade), a giddy man hoping to take a place on Al's staff after the election. Mike and Steve then go out to a remote cabin in the middle of nowhere, and, do I even need to continue? Penelope Spheeris, who directed Wayne's World, doesn't provide the same care and attention to Black Sheep as she did that fantastic rock comedy. But it's the writing that fails the film the most. In Tommy Boy (there I go again), the funny thing was David Spade's Richard character was actually smarter and more intellectual than Farley's Tommy character. In Black Sheep, David Spade's Steve acts as an intellectual, when he isn't much sharper than the crayon he he picks on. Black Sheep is cute, but sour in more places that I would've liked. The plot is tired, the antics are rowdy but only a few funny, and no one looks optimistic about the performance of the project. Starring: Chris Farley, David Spade, Tim Matheson, and Gary Busey. Directed by: Penelope Spheeris.

"Black Sheep", in my review, "completely untraditional, but somewhat hilarious".

    'Black Sheep' is a decent comedy from the 1990's, that offers laughter here and there. But, the main reason why I really enjoyed this film was - The Great Chris Farley. In the lead role, the late legend delivers a lovable performance, that only goes onto to say, what a talent he was! 'Black Sheep' Synopsis: A gubernatorial candidate hires a wormy special assistant whose only job is to make sure the candidate's well-meaning but incompetent brother doesn't ruin the election. Fred Wolf's Screenplay is funny in parts. However, the writing could've been tighter & more cohesive. Penelope Spheeris Directs this Light-Hearted Comedy, ably. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are ordinary. Performance-Wise: It's Farley all the way. He delivers, as mentioned, a lovable performance. Also, he suits the role perfectly. David Spade contributes nicely in some sequences. Tim Matheson is perfect. Christine Ebersole is fair. Gary Busey & Grant Heslov are as usual. On the whole, 'Black Sheep' is a decent comedy, with Farley ruling the show.

    Black Sheep reminds us of Tommy Boy, another Farley and Spade comedy, released in 1995 and inevitably suffers by comparison. While continuing to elaborate and put emphasis on Farley and Spade's impressive chemistry, the film lacks the fun and adventures had by both the men in Tommy Boy. This is another entry in the "maximum antics, minimum laughter" genre of comedy where a film gets to caught up in over-the-top, slapsticky antics that it forgets in order to be acceptable they have to be funny. Somehow, that just doesn't register with Black Sheep. It continues the same tired antics we saw previously in Tommy Boy. Some of the funniest scenes are when Chris Farley and David Spade are just having a calm talk, but with Farley's persona you can tell how rare those moments are. The story seems to have tried its absolute hardest to distance itself from the formula of Tommy Boy, but it doesn't completely. Mike Donnelly (Farley) is the brother of Al Donnelly (Matheson), who is running for governor of Washington. Mike is told to help campaign for Al, but as you can expect, he can't stop running into goofy situations. Not to mention, Mike keeps finding ways to get into trouble by either getting his picture taken near a recreational center fire or holding a beer and a marijuana joint, further jeopardizing his brother's plans of winning. To prevent any mishaps from his brother, Al hires Steve Dodds (Spade), a giddy man hoping to take a place on Al's staff after the election. Mike and Steve then go out to a remote cabin in the middle of nowhere, and, do I even need to continue? Penelope Spheeris, who directed Wayne's World, doesn't provide the same care and attention to Black Sheep as she did that fantastic rock comedy. But it's the writing that fails the film the most. In Tommy Boy (there I go again), the funny thing was David Spade's Richard character was actually smarter and more intellectual than Farley's Tommy character. In Black Sheep, David Spade's Steve acts as an intellectual, when he isn't much sharper than the crayon he he picks on. Black Sheep is cute, but sour in more places that I would've liked. The plot is tired, the antics are rowdy but only a few funny, and no one looks optimistic about the performance of the project. Starring: Chris Farley, David Spade, Tim Matheson, and Gary Busey. Directed by: Penelope Spheeris.

    You need to take this film at face value. It is not trying to be clever. It is simply out and out slap stick routine stretched out through decently scripted film. This films simple premise is to make you laugh. It certainly made me laugh. The over the top jokes, scenarios and pain really brought this to life as a silly belly laughfest. Nice light hearted comedy offering a laugh to all ages. I think a no brainer comedy is a good thing to lift spirits and raise a smile. I cant imagine anyone not finding this film funny in one way or another. If you like the comedy style of Jim Carey and movement of Lee Evans or Rowan Atkinson then I recommend you give this a go. Enjoy

    In his famous TV show, At The Movies, film critic Gene Siskel said that this was the first film he walked out on in 26 years of reviewing movies. Well, maybe he was having intestinal problem at the moment ! When an important critic says that, it doesn't mean necessarily that he's right. Originally, you are the one who can make Siskel's reviews, or else's, look right or not. Because, any film critic is speaking his own mind, not yours. Sometimes it's the same thing. And sometimes it isn't. This time, obviously for me, it isn't ! Simply this is not a bad movie. The word "intolerable" got no relation with it whatsoever. It's a light and sweet slapstick. Nothing is too goofy or too zany. No one showed ridiculous performance. It reminded me with the work of Laurel & Hardy, yet in colors and with somehow thrilling plot. Chris Farley is doing his routine, and the chemistry between him and David Spade is working. The actual problem is that this movie came after (Tommy Boy  1995) which's a better movie. So the disappointment must be powerful. And yes, you've got to ask yourself; why after a comic detailed breakthrough such as (Tommy..) the new dual goes and make something which's clearly not better (or as good) ?! I believe the studio didn't know how to deal with the newly born star. So, they handled him any script just to exploit his success. But that wasn't for the sake of his career, us, and them; since the movie didn't hit the mark as its precedent. The easy plan to invest Farley this time was by the reoccurrence of (Tommy..)'s factors. And sorrowfully Farley accepted it. Therefore some gags from the original (Tommy Boy) were recycled however on a poor level with not much to support it either (the idea of idiot Farley and rational Spade, the problem of their sleep, even David Spade got nothing new to show this round; he was repeating the whole thing yet weakly !). And for some it was hard to believe that the tongue-in-cheek was the movie's main, or only, goods ! Though, Black Sheep isn't really a Black Sheep. It is relaxingly uncomplicated, and has its moments. Just imagine that it was made before (Tommy..) and they had to release it later, and everything will be fine ! I loved its innocent cartoonish sense, its running gags, the character of the old lunatic veteran (Oh God ! So Gary Busey CAN do comedy !! WAW as long as you live, as along as you see and be surprised !) and the whole wacky time of it, where I didn't feel a single second of cheesiness or repulsiveness or bore. Dear late Gene Siskel. I admire many of your opinions. But, you were totally unfair towards this one. 1996 got some of the real agonizing comedies. Kingpin, The Cable Guy, Larger Than Life are little examples. Sometimes the critic, even the ordinary viewer, stands many movies good or bad one after another, to have no patience for more. So walking out on a movie could mean that one critic is being tortured by one movie. Or that one critic just, for a reason out of the movie, can't have a good time.

    Chris Farley portrayed likable, stoner humor, as in Tommy Boy. This time It's Mike Donnelly (Chris Farley) and Steve Dodds (David Spade) this is better, simply because David Spade's character wasn't so mean or razor sharp sarcastic, like in Tommy Boy. It is set in Washington, where I used to live. Tommy Boy was a virtual remake of Planes, Trains and Automobiles, and instead of the brutally sarcastic David Spade, sarcastic at times, the movie has mostly physical humor and "butt-head humor". More like Laurel and Hardy trying to straighten out corruption in the state election, as he is a target who is set up to ruin his brother's election, and Gary Busey plays a weapon crazy, backwoods war monger, who is a bad guy until near the end of the movie when he is impressed with Mike's combat moves when he saved Steve from being murdered, and he becomes their sort of ally in further action. The type of stupid humor we see include the temporary house in the wilderness losing its roof with a storm following hail and Mike on the top bunk crashes down on Steve. The Fridge slides towards the door and crashes into Mike and he thinks he got pudding in his pants, only there wasn't any in the fridge, possible toilet humor and Mike at an MTV election promotion getting stoned with reefers and protesting on live TV almost ruining his brother. David Spade, is actually funny when he's not sarcastic, such as when the bursting nitro booster gets them high while driving a police car.

    I have been reading some of the comments about the movie "Black Sheep" that people have put up, praising this movie and saying that its funny and Good for civics classes and after careful deliberation I am forced to the conclusion to ask anyone that thinks along these lines, as delicately and dispasionately as possible....You can not be serious. Black Sheep was one of the worst so-called comedies I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing! Let me set you guys straight. Nothing, Repeat, NOTHING funny came out of this movie. The jokes were stale as two week old bread, the directing was uneven and cockeyed, the writing was painfully inept, and the performances, if you can call them that, were a complete waste of time. David Spade is dull and uninteresting as the campaign manager assistant, or whatever he was, to the point were he just seems to standing around in a stupor of some kind. Tim Matheson and The rest of the cast bring absolutely nothing to the table. However, I have saved the Worst for last, Chris Farley. Oh..My...GAAAWWWDD!!!! His acting, If you can call it that, is so over-the-top, overdone, overwrought, overacted, overweight, that it boggles the mind. Now, I now Farley whole shtick on SNL and in his movies his his wild, boisterous personality and to be fair, It worked, to a certain degree in his other movies like "Tommy Boy". However, Tommy Boy, was Oscar worthy material compared to this Craptacular eye-sore of a movie. Here he is not funny at all, he is not even acting bad enough to make fun of! It gets real old real fast and you start to get more and more angry at his ridiculous outbursts. One final observation, There was a point in the movie where they go up to a cabin in the woods were presumably, Comedic Wackieness will ensue, It doesn't. In fact, I actually wondered if the writers had a brief moment of clarity and realized the disaster they were creating and went on strike. So the director and actors tried to improvise around the cabin scenario. In any event, The point in the movie showed, the utter desperation these performers must have been feeling. I say they new what they were doing, but either they didn't know how to salvage it or they just didn't care. Shame on all of them.

    Chris Farley, the man who brought so many laughs with his physical comedy, made a lot of people laugh. And this movie is no different. Instead of Farley working to save his dad'd company with David Spade, he is working to save his brother's campaign with David Spade. Lots of memorable moments with the squad car, the TV trucks, holding Spade hostage, fighting Gary Busey - it just goes on. Sometimes the jokes relied entirely on the response of Farley, which was usually good. But other moments, like at the end with the plane, the joke got a little old and less funny. Overall, I say that the movie is positive. So have a go with Farley. "B+"

    I recently showed Black Sheep to my AP Government Class. Not only did they love it they learned a lot of valuable information about the American Political system. I would highly recommend that Mrs. Knapp show this movie to her AP Government Classes. I have always been a fan of the late Chris Farley and David Spade. This is just another great example of great comedy. As a Doctor in Political Science and a 15 year career in teaching, I can not recommend this movie highly enough. What I am pretty much saying is that it would be really cool if we could watch this movie. And by really cool, I mean really really cool. Go Packers, Go Jeans, Go Farve!

    Black Sheep The hardest part of life on the campaign trail for most candidates must be keeping themselves from forcing the media bus into a ravine. However that scene is a possibility with the simpleton sibling of a governor hopeful in this comedy. To keep his blundering brother Mike (Chris Farley) from ruining his candidacy, Al (Tim Matheson) assigns low-level aide Steve (David Spade) to baby-sit him on his canvassing duties. Meanwhile the incumbent Governor Tracy (Christine Ebersole) releases photos implementing Mike in an arson case. Costing his brother the election, Mike makes amends by discovering inconsistencies in Tracy's vote count. A feeble attempt to build on Spade and Farley's comedic chemistry, Black Sheep fails to capture their previous magic: the characters are hollow, the script is clich&eacute;d and the jokes are abysmal. Besides, every politician already knows to simply appoint any possibly embarrassing relatives to the position of official food taster. (Red Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

    Starring Chris Farley and David Spade, "Black Sheep" is yet another SNL-like comedy produced by creator Lorne Michaels. The movie starts with Mike Donnelly, portrayed by Chris Farley, whose brother is running for governor of Washington, but it turns out that his crazy shenanigans is ruining the campaign. So his brother sends out his personal assistant, portrayed by David Spade, to help keep Mike under control before the big campaign. "Black Sheep" is not a sequel to "Tommy Boy", even though they are both produced by Lorne Michaels, and they both have a special SNL quality to it, and the duo of Chris Farley and David Spade are back, only they are in different roles this time. This movie does have the same formula, but even if it's funny and enjoying, this is not as good as it's previous competition. It was glad to see Farley and Spade back on screen together after they previously worked with each other on "Tommy Boy". They are still wacky and funny like always, and it was really nice to see these two maniacs on screen. But neither one of them brings a unique or really good performance. But I would rather like to see these guys bullying each other, and bond with one quick one-liner after another, like in "Tommy Boy". But they don't accomplish that this time. I did laugh out loud at times, but it was just until later in the movie where almost everything becomes less funny. But let's not forget that Gary Busey, with two horrible-looking buck front teeth, makes an appearance in this movie, and it's just flat-out-weird. "Black Sheep" may be considered as one of the 90s worst movies to others. But I knew what I wanted to see, and I enjoyed another SNL Farley-Spade duo motion picture. "Black Sheep", in my review, "completely untraditional, but somewhat hilarious".

Sometimes the jokes relied entirely on the response of Farley, which was usually good. But other moments, like at the end with the plane, the joke got a little old and less funny. Overall, I say that the movie is positive. So have a go with Farley. "B+"

    I recently showed Black Sheep to my AP Government Class. Not only did they love it they learned a lot of valuable information about the American Political system. I would highly recommend that Mrs. Knapp show this movie to her AP Government Classes. I have always been a fan of the late Chris Farley and David Spade. This is just another great example of great comedy. As a Doctor in Political Science and a 15 year career in teaching, I can not recommend this movie highly enough. What I am pretty much saying is that it would be really cool if we could watch this movie. And by really cool, I mean really really cool. Go Packers, Go Jeans, Go Farve!

    Black Sheep The hardest part of life on the campaign trail for most candidates must be keeping themselves from forcing the media bus into a ravine. However that scene is a possibility with the simpleton sibling of a governor hopeful in this comedy. To keep his blundering brother Mike (Chris Farley) from ruining his candidacy, Al (Tim Matheson) assigns low-level aide Steve (David Spade) to baby-sit him on his canvassing duties. Meanwhile the incumbent Governor Tracy (Christine Ebersole) releases photos implementing Mike in an arson case. Costing his brother the election, Mike makes amends by discovering inconsistencies in Tracy's vote count. A feeble attempt to build on Spade and Farley's comedic chemistry, Black Sheep fails to capture their previous magic: the characters are hollow, the script is clich&eacute;d and the jokes are abysmal. Besides, every politician already knows to simply appoint any possibly embarrassing relatives to the position of official food taster. (Red Light) vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

    Starring Chris Farley and David Spade, "Black Sheep" is yet another SNL-like comedy produced by creator Lorne Michaels. The movie starts with Mike Donnelly, portrayed by Chris Farley, whose brother is running for governor of Washington, but it turns out that his crazy shenanigans is ruining the campaign. So his brother sends out his personal assistant, portrayed by David Spade, to help keep Mike under control before the big campaign. "Black Sheep" is not a sequel to "Tommy Boy", even though they are both produced by Lorne Michaels, and they both have a special SNL quality to it, and the duo of Chris Farley and David Spade are back, only they are in different roles this time. This movie does have the same formula, but even if it's funny and enjoying, this is not as good as it's previous competition. It was glad to see Farley and Spade back on screen together after they previously worked with each other on "Tommy Boy". They are still wacky and funny like always, and it was really nice to see these two maniacs on screen. But neither one of them brings a unique or really good performance. But I would rather like to see these guys bullying each other, and bond with one quick one-liner after another, like in "Tommy Boy". But they don't accomplish that this time. I did laugh out loud at times, but it was just until later in the movie where almost everything becomes less funny. But let's not forget that Gary Busey, with two horrible-looking buck front teeth, makes an appearance in this movie, and it's just flat-out-weird. "Black Sheep" may be considered as one of the 90s worst movies to others. But I knew what I wanted to see, and I enjoyed another SNL Farley-Spade duo motion picture. "Black Sheep", in my review, "completely untraditional, but somewhat hilarious".

    'Black Sheep' is a decent comedy from the 1990's, that offers laughter here and there. But, the main reason why I really enjoyed this film was - The Great Chris Farley. In the lead role, the late legend delivers a lovable performance, that only goes onto to say, what a talent he was! 'Black Sheep' Synopsis: A gubernatorial candidate hires a wormy special assistant whose only job is to make sure the candidate's well-meaning but incompetent brother doesn't ruin the election. Fred Wolf's Screenplay is funny in parts. However, the writing could've been tighter & more cohesive. Penelope Spheeris Directs this Light-Hearted Comedy, ably. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are ordinary. Performance-Wise: It's Farley all the way. He delivers, as mentioned, a lovable performance. Also, he suits the role perfectly. David Spade contributes nicely in some sequences. Tim Matheson is perfect. Christine Ebersole is fair. Gary Busey & Grant Heslov are as usual. On the whole, 'Black Sheep' is a decent comedy, with Farley ruling the show.

    Black Sheep reminds us of Tommy Boy, another Farley and Spade comedy, released in 1995 and inevitably suffers by comparison. While continuing to elaborate and put emphasis on Farley and Spade's impressive chemistry, the film lacks the fun and adventures had by both the men in Tommy Boy. This is another entry in the "maximum antics, minimum laughter" genre of comedy where a film gets to caught up in over-the-top, slapsticky antics that it forgets in order to be acceptable they have to be funny. Somehow, that just doesn't register with Black Sheep. It continues the same tired antics we saw previously in Tommy Boy. Some of the funniest scenes are when Chris Farley and David Spade are just having a calm talk, but with Farley's persona you can tell how rare those moments are. The story seems to have tried its absolute hardest to distance itself from the formula of Tommy Boy, but it doesn't completely. Mike Donnelly (Farley) is the brother of Al Donnelly (Matheson), who is running for governor of Washington. Mike is told to help campaign for Al, but as you can expect, he can't stop running into goofy situations. Not to mention, Mike keeps finding ways to get into trouble by either getting his picture taken near a recreational center fire or holding a beer and a marijuana joint, further jeopardizing his brother's plans of winning. To prevent any mishaps from his brother, Al hires Steve Dodds (Spade), a giddy man hoping to take a place on Al's staff after the election. Mike and Steve then go out to a remote cabin in the middle of nowhere, and, do I even need to continue? Penelope Spheeris, who directed Wayne's World, doesn't provide the same care and attention to Black Sheep as she did that fantastic rock comedy. But it's the writing that fails the film the most. In Tommy Boy (there I go again), the funny thing was David Spade's Richard character was actually smarter and more intellectual than Farley's Tommy character. In Black Sheep, David Spade's Steve acts as an intellectual, when he isn't much sharper than the crayon he he picks on. Black Sheep is cute, but sour in more places that I would've liked. The plot is tired, the antics are rowdy but only a few funny, and no one looks optimistic about the performance of the project. Starring: Chris Farley, David Spade, Tim Matheson, and Gary Busey. Directed by: Penelope Spheeris.

    You need to take this film at face value. It is not trying to be clever. It is simply out and out slap stick routine stretched out through decently scripted film. This films simple premise is to make you laugh. It certainly made me laugh. The over the top jokes, scenarios and pain really brought this to life as a silly belly laughfest. Nice light hearted comedy offering a laugh to all ages. I think a no brainer comedy is a good thing to lift spirits and raise a smile. I cant imagine anyone not finding this film funny in one way or another. If you like the comedy style of Jim Carey and movement of Lee Evans or Rowan Atkinson then I recommend you give this a go. Enjoy

    In his famous TV show, At The Movies, film critic Gene Siskel said that this was the first film he walked out on in 26 years of reviewing movies. Well, maybe he was having intestinal problem at the moment ! When an important critic says that, it doesn't mean necessarily that he's right. Originally, you are the one who can make Siskel's reviews, or else's, look right or not. Because, any film critic is speaking his own mind, not yours. Sometimes it's the same thing. And sometimes it isn't. This time, obviously for me, it isn't ! Simply this is not a bad movie. The word "intolerable" got no relation with it whatsoever. It's a light and sweet slapstick. Nothing is too goofy or too zany. No one showed ridiculous performance. It reminded me with the work of Laurel & Hardy, yet in colors and with somehow thrilling plot. Chris Farley is doing his routine, and the chemistry between him and David Spade is working. The actual problem is that this movie came after (Tommy Boy  1995) which's a better movie. So the disappointment must be powerful. And yes, you've got to ask yourself; why after a comic detailed breakthrough such as (Tommy..) the new dual goes and make something which's clearly not better (or as good) ?! I believe the studio didn't know how to deal with the newly born star. So, they handled him any script just to exploit his success. But that wasn't for the sake of his career, us, and them; since the movie didn't hit the mark as its precedent. The easy plan to invest Farley this time was by the reoccurrence of (Tommy..)'s factors. And sorrowfully Farley accepted it. Therefore some gags from the original (Tommy Boy) were recycled however on a poor level with not much to support it either (the idea of idiot Farley and rational Spade, the problem of their sleep, even David Spade got nothing new to show this round; he was repeating the whole thing yet weakly !). And for some it was hard to believe that the tongue-in-cheek was the movie's main, or only, goods ! Though, Black Sheep isn't really a Black Sheep. It is relaxingly uncomplicated, and has its moments. Just imagine that it was made before (Tommy..) and they had to release it later, and everything will be fine ! I loved its innocent cartoonish sense, its running gags, the character of the old lunatic veteran (Oh God ! So Gary Busey CAN do comedy !! WAW as long as you live, as along as you see and be surprised !) and the whole wacky time of it, where I didn't feel a single second of cheesiness or repulsiveness or bore. Dear late Gene Siskel. I admire many of your opinions. But, you were totally unfair towards this one. 1996 got some of the real agonizing comedies. Kingpin, The Cable Guy, Larger Than Life are little examples. Sometimes the critic, even the ordinary viewer, stands many movies good or bad one after another, to have no patience for more. So walking out on a movie could mean that one critic is being tortured by one movie. Or that one critic just, for a reason out of the movie, can't have a good time.

    Chris Farley portrayed likable, stoner humor, as in Tommy Boy. This time It's Mike Donnelly (Chris Farley) and Steve Dodds (David Spade) this is better, simply because David Spade's character wasn't so mean or razor sharp sarcastic, like in Tommy Boy. It is set in Washington, where I used to live. Tommy Boy was a virtual remake of Planes, Trains and Automobiles, and instead of the brutally sarcastic David Spade, sarcastic at times, the movie has mostly physical humor and "butt-head humor". More like Laurel and Hardy trying to straighten out corruption in the state election, as he is a target who is set up to ruin his brother's election, and Gary Busey plays a weapon crazy, backwoods war monger, who is a bad guy until near the end of the movie when he is impressed with Mike's combat moves when he saved Steve from being murdered, and he becomes their sort of ally in further action. The type of stupid humor we see include the temporary house in the wilderness losing its roof with a storm following hail and Mike on the top bunk crashes down on Steve. The Fridge slides towards the door and crashes into Mike and he thinks he got pudding in his pants, only there wasn't any in the fridge, possible toilet humor and Mike at an MTV election promotion getting stoned with reefers and protesting on live TV almost ruining his brother. David Spade, is actually funny when he's not sarcastic, such as when the bursting nitro booster gets them high while driving a police car.

    I have been reading some of the comments about the movie "Black Sheep" that people have put up, praising this movie and saying that its funny and Good for civics classes and after careful deliberation I am forced to the conclusion to ask anyone that thinks along these lines, as delicately and dispasionately as possible....You can not be serious. Black Sheep was one of the worst so-called comedies I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing! Let me set you guys straight. Nothing, Repeat, NOTHING funny came out of this movie. The jokes were stale as two week old bread, the directing was uneven and cockeyed, the writing was painfully inept, and the performances, if you can call them that, were a complete waste of time. David Spade is dull and uninteresting as the campaign manager assistant, or whatever he was, to the point were he just seems to standing around in a stupor of some kind. Tim Matheson and The rest of the cast bring absolutely nothing to the table. However, I have saved the Worst for last, Chris Farley. Oh..My...GAAAWWWDD!!!! His acting, If you can call it that, is so over-the-top, overdone, overwrought, overacted, overweight, that it boggles the mind. Now, I now Farley whole shtick on SNL and in his movies his his wild, boisterous personality and to be fair, It worked, to a certain degree in his other movies like "Tommy Boy". However, Tommy Boy, was Oscar worthy material compared to this Craptacular eye-sore of a movie. Here he is not funny at all, he is not even acting bad enough to make fun of! It gets real old real fast and you start to get more and more angry at his ridiculous outbursts. One final observation, There was a point in the movie where they go up to a cabin in the woods were presumably, Comedic Wackieness will ensue, It doesn't. In fact, I actually wondered if the writers had a brief moment of clarity and realized the disaster they were creating and went on strike. So the director and actors tried to improvise around the cabin scenario. In any event, The point in the movie showed, the utter desperation these performers must have been feeling. I say they new what they were doing, but either they didn't know how to salvage it or they just didn't care. Shame on all of them.
