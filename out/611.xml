  Detective Mark McPherson investigates the killing of Laura, found dead on her apartment floor before the movie starts.

    This movie fits on all counts but one! you could have a wild guess who the killer is, while the director tries to provide you with alternative versions to distract you. The movie starts out with the death of a Laura (Gene Tierney), and Detective Mc Pherson (Dana Andrews) trying to investigate the murder. The movie then goes on along McP's collection and rechecking evidence. He tries to soften the suspects by trash talk and trying to read into their reactions. Waldo and Shelby are both in the doubting list and confront McP many times. However, what follows is a classic Noir genre. The twist and the motives are good, effective and worth the 7/10. Looking back at the times when this movie was made, it deserves more than a 7! Hope you enjoy this as much as I have!

    LAURA is a really solid murder mystery with lots of clever dialog most of which are uttered by Clifton Webb's character. Gene Tierney oozes sex even though she is fully clothed all the time. Dana Andrews is tough as nails but his detective character wasn't too well developed. We know he isn't exactly a feminist (When a dame gets killed, she doesn't worry about how she looks.) And him falling in love with Laura was a bit hard to digest. The sinister ending is worth the price of admission. This is a great murder mystery. Obviously some of the characters are there just to make the plot more complicated. (7/10)

    I probably saw this first on TV as early as the 1950's. Have seen it many times since and can probably recite much of the dialog by heart. I agree with most of the positive reviews and I'm glad it has stood the test of time (considering the times in which it was made). I was a young girl so impressed, I named my first daughter, "Laura" -- as much for the beautiful theme as for the character. I also found and read the novel at a used book sale in the late '60s and owned an original copy of the sheet music. I was surprised to find out that this is considered a film noir classic. A film noir with a happy ending? Just the type of old classic movie to thrill a young girl's heart. My impressions then: Laura was a glamorous career woman -- even for the 1950's when I first encountered her, but I enjoyed Gene Tierney's movies, because I could identify with her. Much is said about her socialite and high class background and demure; however, she had an every girl quality too and many educated young women fancied themselves quite sophisticated a la Tierney. Beautiful yes, but there were many actresses even more beautiful. Don't forget the overbite. I most recently saw this movie in the past few years. Clifton Webb is the star of this movie -- a fine actor -- but he had the best lines by far. Vincent Price overacted (as he always did), and Dana Andrews literally sleepwalked (nothing new). Gene Tierney just glowed with star quality as ever. I love when old movies can just suggest what's happened thru dialog and acting, instead of beating you over the head and rubbing your face in it. But I did wonder, this time, what Mark and Laura would have in common or even to talk about once they rolled out of bed. Laura is a perfect movie for its time, but I don't believe it would impress my daughter. It would probably be a yawn.

    Laura was a project, based on a pulpy novel by Vera Caspery, that director Otto Preminger had to fight 20th Century Fox Mogul, Daryl Zanuck, to get made. It was a film that everyone else involved in did not believe in and assumed would be a failure. Yet the film went on to be a huge success and was a source of influence for countless film makers and endures as a classic of the golden era of Hollywood. On the face of it, Laura was in the mode of film noir, with the conventional detective investigating the murder of a glamorous and enthralling woman- as-femme-fatale; the film offers the usual twists in narrative structure and the dubious relationships and men surrounding the central figure, and their obsessions, or neuroses; but visually the film separates itself from the dark shadows and brooding atmosphere of the conventional noir films, and brings an obsessive, illuminating Freudian drama of sexual emasculation and the fundamental flaws of masculine desire. Dana Andrews's investigating detective McPherson, is assigned to the murder case of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), an assured, successful woman, surrounded by seemingly rich and powerful men, who was gunned down in her apartment. As he uncovers information about Laura, helped by a portrait hanging on her living room wall, McPherson, like the men he interviews, becomes obsessed with the woman, as her delightful character, and her determined but innocent-like attractiveness envelops him. Clifton Webb's overtly dandy Waldo, a successful columnist, displays his love of Laura through his detailed recollections of their relationship, whilst the charming yet alarmingly vacant Shelby (Vincent Price), a man having affairs with noticeably more than one woman, is the more darkly sinister of the two, and often (perhaps innocently) implicates himself in the murder. About halfway through the film there is a huge narrative shift, which at first is jarring, as the audience is not sure if this is the fantasy or dream of McPherson, but the revelation shifts the story, questioning the reality of the two main suspects. As McPherson is drawn into the elusive Laura's lifestyle, the central focus of much of the narrative is set in the presence of a painting of Laura hanging in her room. It is an idealisation of the woman - she appears dominating in the picture - an image that is captured not by Laura, but by the men around her. This image is easier to handle that the real thing, it is a passive version of the woman. Whilst a lot is put upon the sexual power that Laura has on these men, it is the neuroses and imbalanced psyches of the men. But Laura, as we discover, is a more individual, independent woman, who perhaps does not require the desire of others. So the fantasised painted version of her can be contained and controlled. A reading could suggest that the power that Laura has over these men somehow perpetuates the incitement to murder, but in fact it would be easier to read that it is the breakdown of the masculine that is the determining factor in murder, and not necessarily a woman who is unsure of her decisions when it comes to settling. The performances are phenomenal here. Andrew's hard-boiled detective is excellent, with his proto-Columbo style of investigation, playing games with the suspects, and forcing them into corners. Price and Webb are brilliantly over-the-top - Price giving a sinister performance through the disguise of charisma. But, inevitably, the titular character, through the mysterious, seductive beauty of Tierney, is awesome in a tricksy way. She is not necessarily the traditional femme fatale, she is not consciously playing these men, yet at times the audience is unsure. Is she twisting the delusions of these men to her will? Or is she as sweet as she sometimes appears? It is an almost perfect performance. The influence of this film is undisputed. The James Elroy novel, The Black Dahlia, whilst loosely based on a true-life crime, was undoubtedly broadened by Laura's influence. The Black Dahlia has the central theme of the obsession by an investigator of a dead woman. These themes of obsession must have been directly correlated by David Lynch and Mark Frost when they wrote and conceived of Twin Peaks which began with the death of a high school girl, and the subsequent investigation unravels levels of obsession in a small community, much of which extended from this one girl. It's a wonderful, twisty, and often surprising story that illustrates that the power of women is not always a product of feminine knowing, but the failures and compulsions of weak, lonely men. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Let me horrify you from my first lines, so you can decide right now if you go on reading this review or you'll just pass: Laura is above all about sexual repression in the social upper crust in the 40s. Truth is, I've never seen a flick where it appears so evident that none of the main characters are doing it; or that they are doing it in a enjoyable way. Even worse, they are sublimating their libidosthat one I learned it in Secondary III, in Psychology class--falling in love, or fantasizing, about unreachable ones. If you don't believe it, just mention me a single occasion here where, as the saying goes, two sets of eyes find each other across a crowded room; when a man looks at a woman with lust in his eyes; when two hands rub each other by accident, trying to reach an astray for ex., and faces go red, hands tremble. Nope, there's absolutely no sexual tension in any scene here, no hint that any of these people have normal sexual lives. All you hear in its 87 min. is talk, talk, talk--which is the easiest way of getting rid of the excess libido. But, you'll argue, the same can be said of many flicks; like say, Guns of Navarone. That's true--but people there had good reasons as they were using their libidos to try to win a war. The difference in Laura is, all here are blatantly showcasing their needs, while at the same time trying by all means to have a substitute which would allow them the release without having to go through the experience itself. At its core, Laura is a scathing portrait of how unfulfilling the sex life of this crowd was at that epoch, despite all the ritzy appearances. Here the main focus of sublimated lust of every Joe is Laura herself, the incredibly beautiful yet sexually neutral, anodyne goddess to fantasize about but who'll turn into ashes--or stone?-as soon as you touch her.(this is not meant to be a criticism of Tierney, truly, but if she was such a hot ticket then is because her aseptic beauty fitted best the tastes and conventions of those puritanical, pre--Marilyn times in Hollywood). And of course women will fantasize about men they can't have. At the end the only real crime committed here is having them all licking their chops while not getting any. (BTW, in the original script Laura really died, which means McPherson fell in love with her portrait, following the norm). Now, about the technical aspect, the package, the cinematography, I'm not the first one to say it: Laura is all about style, about beautiful people in beautiful clothes parading in elegant surroundings, drinking champagne and carrying on their beautiful conversations. Speaking of which, I've never seen a flick with more contrived, unnatural, lines of dialog. I was checking all along and I could barely find any case in which a character was taken off guard by someone else's remark and had to pause, think, before giving an answer. It was just like a tennis match, snappy lines coming and going, as if the characters were all reading their lines which of course reveals the artificiality of the whole thing. As for Waldo I can't believe his insulting invectives could pass for witticism at any time, context, social milieu. Are they sure they consulted the right entry in Webster's? And man, does he sound like something is wrong with him. If someone came nowadays talking like that to a hotel desk they would make him lie down, give him some air and call a doctor. Where do they talk like that, in Mensa meetings, in the Save the Platypus organization?. And frankly I don't see this one as a noir. Rather as a flick that purposely started trying to be a noir only to lose its way going there and becoming entangled in a mess of assorted things: drama de moeurs (as the French say), faux--romance, crime thriller, social commentary. The only linking element being, as said, that the characters are not getting any. Noir characters need a least some depth, some dramatic reach, and these here are unbelievable in their shallowness and artificiality, more cardboard cuts than real people. Neither there's any atmosphere, no ambiance, no feel of impending doom. I didn't even feel for Laura when she was "arrested", as at that point I wasn't even looking at her as a real person, just as an image on a screen. Despite it all Laura is half-heartedly recommended, if only to know what the fuss is about. As a plus you have the typical Preminger direction, with his meticulous setting & framing of sceneswith his proverbial economy of shots, as we know--with his expert use of full bodied blacks along with resplendent whites. Most of the action unfolds in interiors, giving him the chance for indulging in luxurious surroundings--gorgeous sculptures, Ming vases, invaluable paintingsto the point that Laura's apartment looks like the ballroom of the Titanic. Or that was Waldo's bathroom...In any case, don't look for emotion, for sexual tension or for depth here. There's no one single relationship having any of that; they all look contrived, specially that of the leads. Just picture it: Laura sees as proof of the cop's love the fact that he arrests her for murder, so he can show her his feelings "in an more official setting". If that doesn't turn you away, then give it a try. 6.0/10.

    This is definitely one of the finest crime thrillers of its times. Otto Preminger was able to direct a movie that is gripping and very mysterious because of the storyline, and at the same time tremendously dialogue-oriented, because of its structure. He gave this noir movie a fine European touch, mainly due to the fact that there aren't any spectacular gun fights, chases or on-screen murders, but the emphasis is put on dialogues, which encourage one's imagination to produce vivid images of the crime. It's a tale of brutal murder, and huge obsession that lead to it. However, the unexpected turn, placed brilliantly somewhere in the middle of the movie, makes it even more suspenseful. The film makes a great use of various flashbacks to show the roots of this enormous obsession and jealousy coming from the side of Waldo Lydecker. Fine narrative voice-over that is somehow very similar to the one used later in Sunset Boulevard. It is supposed to set the mood and impose an intrigue that will satisfy the viewer and make him concentrated on every detail of the story. You can see the director's professionalism in every aspect of the film. For one, he makes a fascinating use of symbolism, and various elements that come with it (namely the two clocks), which ultimately lead to an important discovery, providing the horrifying explanation of this tough case. Dana Andrews is fantastic as a detective, who is serious about his job, but at the same time inescapably falls in love with the girl, whose murder he is investigating. He wants to show how tough and unemotional he can be when it comes to his line of work, but after some time the only thing he cares about is Laura and her safety. Talking about the titular girl: Gene Tierney is really appealing and convincing as pure, seemingly innocent and very amiable Laura. Her mesmerizing beauty makes it very easy to believe that every man falls in love with her right away and wants to have her only to himself. Clifton Webb is great as this really clever and wise writer, who with a little help of his huge intelligence and cunningness is able to convince everyone that he should be the least suspected person in the whole case. All in all, Laura is a very fine thriller with a properly developed plot and well-selected cast of characters. Everyone can be a suspect, just like in all the decent detective tale that you will find. But the somber atmosphere surrounding the story and incredible jealousy and obsessive behavior depicted in it provide for a noir title that everybody should see at least once.

    Laura Hunt is a young, beautiful, hugely successful New York advertising executive. Or rather she was those things. Because as this movie opens Laura is dead. Murdered, a shotgun blast to the face. So who was Laura really? What do we really know about her? Those are intriguing questions. But this movie's big question is of course who killed her? The mystery unfolds with a small handful of suspects and an at times rather peculiar investigation. Along the way we have some flashbacks to help establish who Laura was, how our suspects were connected to her, and why anyone could have possibly wanted to blow this seemingly innocent woman's head off. Because on the surface her murder makes very little sense. As you try to make some sense of it all the movie has some big surprises in store for you. Dana Andrews plays the role of detective Mark McPherson, who in the course of his investigation does some rather unusual things. Things which quite frankly no detective would ever actually do. But we will see he must do these things to move the movie's plot forward. Without this series of contrivances there would be no movie. Rather sloppy plotting it must be said but not so bad as to greatly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. One of McPherson's absurd actions is to allow one of his prime suspects to tag along for interrogations of his other prime suspects. A very contrived way to get all the key players in a room together. That prime suspect is newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker, the man responsible for making Laura who she was. Just ask him, he'll tell you. He loves talking about himself that's for sure. Clifton Webb plays this flamboyant, rather effeminate character. Waldo prances through the movie like a queen but it is apparent that he was quite in love with Laura. Which makes the fact that Laura was about to marry another man quite unacceptable in Waldo's eyes. The man Laura intended to marry is Shelby Carpenter, a not particularly intelligent country bumpkin who somehow finds himself moving in Manhattan's highest social circles. But did Laura really intend to marry Shelby? Waldo would have you believe she was reconsidering the marriage. If Shelby knew that he might certainly have a motive for the murder. Meanwhile Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell, has a thing for Shelby so maybe she wanted Laura out of the way. And Laura's maid also seemed to have an unusually strong affection for Laura. So there are the suspects. The movie then goes through a series of twists and turns, one of which is a real doozy, before all will finally be revealed. This is an intriguing movie but perhaps not quite as engrossing as it may have been. Even at less than ninety minutes the movie seems a bit slow and labored at times. The fact that some of the key story elements are scarcely believable doesn't help. Andrews does an OK job in playing the movie's detective but the fact that detective does so many frankly stupid things sometimes makes it hard to take the guy seriously. Webb floats through the movie on a cloud, chewing as much scenery as he can swallow. But his performance does make for a memorable character. The problem is that when you see Webb's 50-something Waldo with Gene Tierney's beautiful 20-something Laura the love story doesn't ring true. The oddest of odd couples. Then again while Laura had affection for Waldo she was after all intending to marry another man. So it's apparently unrequited love on Waldo's part. That other man, Shelby, is played by Vincent Price. It's not always easy playing a hapless dunce and that's pretty much what Shelby is. But Price does very well in the role. As the aunt and the maid Judith Anderson and Dorothy Adams respectively have less to do. They're pushed forward as possible suspects but the movie focuses most of its attention on Waldo and Shelby. Laura herself gets a little lost but Tierney certainly holds her own when she gets her opportunities. This is a movie which wants to keep you guessing but it doesn't always succeed in that. It certainly surprises you here and there but by the end there's a creeping sense of inevitability. Most in the audience will probably guess the murderer's identity before the movie's detective does. When we get to that ending we find it's just as contrived as much of what has preceded it. Instead of going out with a bang the movie fizzles out in what is slightly disappointing fashion. This isn't a bad murder mystery but it would be hard to call it a truly great one. It has its intriguing elements but the whole ends up being a little less than the sum of its parts.

    Provocative Mystery and Stylish Glamour; Glorious Portrait and Haunting Score

    A portrait, a painting, a piece of art have always played a decisive role in addressing our emotions and leading our thoughts to some 'idealized reality.' A beautiful woman in the painting has been a focus of interest...men admired her, women envied her; yet both have been affected by her glamor, mystery, detail and style. "A passion for the unavailable," as Petrarch once described the name Laura, is precisely what we encounter in this powerful film noir of the 1940s where one of the most beautiful actresses, Gene Tierney, at last decided to "play a painting." But is it only the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who makes this film one of the most aesthetic and fabulous screen productions? Is the widespread appreciation and applause dedicated only to her? All the merits of the film appear to focus on PORTRAIT, SCORE and ATMOSPHERE. These three aspects, as certain details, seem to create the harmony of the general conclusion after viewing LAURA. As a film noir (one of its very best manifestations), LAURA emphasizes the portrait of "a woman of mystery and glamor" (Gene Tierney)...an advertising executive whom we get to know with New York police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews). Just for curiosity, the portrait was initially painted by director Rouben Mamoulian's wife (first director of the movie) but...as a matter of fact, what we actually find in the movie is a blowup of Gene Tierney's photograph. The portrait leads us to the specific atmosphere of tension, suspicion, glamor, haunt, mystery and the unpredictable effects of murder investigation...the atmosphere at its best! This atmosphere is enriched by magnificent score, a unique work by David Raksin, a novelty at that time promoted by the composer for Fox studio Alfred Newman. His score supplies us with unforgettable feelings while watching the movie and helps the viewers keep interest and suspicion. It beautifully adapts detective elements, sexual references and a sentiment to the scenes. To enrich the atmosphere, we also need to add the flashbacks that play an important role in the movie and explain a lot in discovering the events as well as lead us to a certain reality and emotions. Also, the moody scenes with stunning cinematography add certain moods and resemblance. Another significant aspect of LAURA's artistry are, of course, the performances. Although there are practically not many characters in the movie, casting occurred to be pretty challenging. It is important to keep in mind that the author of the novel, Vera Caspary, badly wanted a screen adaptation but had her word in many decisions, including the portrayals of characters. After the long and tedious process of casting (even Marlene Dietrich was willing to play the lead), the results are fabulous. Gene Tierney portrays a sophisticated woman of the high society, no naive woman, no femme fatale but a strong woman who gets balanced among three men our attention is called upon: the newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) whose vicious charm shapes her decisions and who has, indeed, the strongest power in her life; her fianc&eacute; Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a gentle man who "would not even kill a fly" and the police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) who suspects no one and everyone at the same time. In between the men comes her wealthy aunt, Ann Treadwell memorably portrayed by the highly respected actress whose career illumined both the stage and cinema, Judith Anderson. However, let me consider the male performances in more details. Dana Andrews does a brilliant job as the detective making us not only the observers of the investigation but, thanks to the powerful and effective depiction of indefatigable determination, he lets us into his world where women are 'dames' and where suspicions are daily bread. The most unforgettable scene is when he enters Laura's apartment and the emphasis on details, the dream-like tension and his instantaneous movements occur to be the clarity with no words. Clifton Webb, who portrays the most difficult character, in fact, excellently combines the wretchedness with sympathy, doubt with certainty. He is not a villain and he does not look to be one... He is a man of power, a man of talent, a man of self esteem and mannerisms. He even becomes respectable, even in the eyes of the most suspicious viewers until... Vincent Price has his moments in the film, he is vibrant and genuine in the role; a young and inexperienced in man-woman relation? A little but shy? It occurs quite meaningful to state that both Clifton Webb and Vincent Price started their careers from supporting roles and then became legendary. However, there is yet another legendary name in LAURA that makes this film stand out as a historic production...that is the "tireless" (according to Gene Tierney) director Otto Preminger. Vincent Price memorably stated: "Otto Preminger had an implicit knowledge of pseudo-sophisticated world" and supplied the characters with the 'sense of evil' not making anyone villains. Preminger's great achievement is the fact that he managed to combine a detective story with psychology. His direction makes the film both sophisticated and romantic...I don't doubt that Rouben Mamoulian with his exquisite talents would also have managed that stylish element (he proved that in DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE)...yet, some of his requirements occurred to be of little use for the crew and the author herself. LAURA is a great atmospheric film noir, a provocative mystery combined with the stylish glamor where the haunting score leads us to the glorious portrait of female charm and mystery. 9/10

    Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been murdered, and as New York City Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigates, he finds that everyone seems to be in love with her -- and he, too, gradually falls under her spell. But things aren't always what they seem. Darryl F. Zanuck was opposed to casting Clifton Webb because of his known homosexuality, but Preminger prevailed and the 54-year-old Webb, making his first screen appearance since the silent era, was nominated for an Oscar. Webb really does sell the film, with lines like, "Will you stop calling her a dame? Does this look like the home of a dame? Have you ever known a woman who wasn't a doll or a dame?" Great dignified actor. And speaking of dignified, you have Vincent Price, young and without any facial hair, even before his voice achieved its full distinctiveness. Interestingly, he comes off as a wimp here and seems to go back and forth between stage and screen style acting. (Price always had a very stage quality to his film roles.) Does this film have a connection to "Twin Peaks"? A girl named Laura, murdered, with everyone attracted to her? I do not know... there is no direct connection, but it came to my mind.

    This movie reminds me of Casablanca in that it SHOULD have been just a run-of-the- mill noirish potboiler, but it ends up being so much more than that, thanks to a happy confluence of talents. Just as Bogart and Bergman, with the help of Claude Rains, raise Casablanca to sublimity, so too do Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney raise this material with the considerable help of Clifton Webb. The performances (Vincent Price and Judith Anderson in SUPPORTING roles!?!) mesh together like gears in a Rolex, and it's a pleasure to behold. I know it's been said before, but Gene Tierney's amazing looks make one believe that a detective could fall in love with her portrait. This movie is a superlative exemplar of its genre, and anyone who is a fan of that genre should do themselves a favor and see this film immediately.

    This movie fits on all counts but one! you could have a wild guess who the killer is, while the director tries to provide you with alternative versions to distract you. The movie starts out with the death of a Laura (Gene Tierney), and Detective Mc Pherson (Dana Andrews) trying to investigate the murder. The movie then goes on along McP's collection and rechecking evidence. He tries to soften the suspects by trash talk and trying to read into their reactions. Waldo and Shelby are both in the doubting list and confront McP many times. However, what follows is a classic Noir genre. The twist and the motives are good, effective and worth the 7/10. Looking back at the times when this movie was made, it deserves more than a 7! Hope you enjoy this as much as I have!

    LAURA is a really solid murder mystery with lots of clever dialog most of which are uttered by Clifton Webb's character. Gene Tierney oozes sex even though she is fully clothed all the time. Dana Andrews is tough as nails but his detective character wasn't too well developed. We know he isn't exactly a feminist (When a dame gets killed, she doesn't worry about how she looks.) And him falling in love with Laura was a bit hard to digest. The sinister ending is worth the price of admission. This is a great murder mystery. Obviously some of the characters are there just to make the plot more complicated. (7/10)

    I probably saw this first on TV as early as the 1950's. Have seen it many times since and can probably recite much of the dialog by heart. I agree with most of the positive reviews and I'm glad it has stood the test of time (considering the times in which it was made). I was a young girl so impressed, I named my first daughter, "Laura" -- as much for the beautiful theme as for the character. I also found and read the novel at a used book sale in the late '60s and owned an original copy of the sheet music. I was surprised to find out that this is considered a film noir classic. A film noir with a happy ending? Just the type of old classic movie to thrill a young girl's heart. My impressions then: Laura was a glamorous career woman -- even for the 1950's when I first encountered her, but I enjoyed Gene Tierney's movies, because I could identify with her. Much is said about her socialite and high class background and demure; however, she had an every girl quality too and many educated young women fancied themselves quite sophisticated a la Tierney. Beautiful yes, but there were many actresses even more beautiful. Don't forget the overbite. I most recently saw this movie in the past few years. Clifton Webb is the star of this movie -- a fine actor -- but he had the best lines by far. Vincent Price overacted (as he always did), and Dana Andrews literally sleepwalked (nothing new). Gene Tierney just glowed with star quality as ever. I love when old movies can just suggest what's happened thru dialog and acting, instead of beating you over the head and rubbing your face in it. But I did wonder, this time, what Mark and Laura would have in common or even to talk about once they rolled out of bed. Laura is a perfect movie for its time, but I don't believe it would impress my daughter. It would probably be a yawn.

    Laura was a project, based on a pulpy novel by Vera Caspery, that director Otto Preminger had to fight 20th Century Fox Mogul, Daryl Zanuck, to get made. It was a film that everyone else involved in did not believe in and assumed would be a failure. Yet the film went on to be a huge success and was a source of influence for countless film makers and endures as a classic of the golden era of Hollywood. On the face of it, Laura was in the mode of film noir, with the conventional detective investigating the murder of a glamorous and enthralling woman- as-femme-fatale; the film offers the usual twists in narrative structure and the dubious relationships and men surrounding the central figure, and their obsessions, or neuroses; but visually the film separates itself from the dark shadows and brooding atmosphere of the conventional noir films, and brings an obsessive, illuminating Freudian drama of sexual emasculation and the fundamental flaws of masculine desire. Dana Andrews's investigating detective McPherson, is assigned to the murder case of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), an assured, successful woman, surrounded by seemingly rich and powerful men, who was gunned down in her apartment. As he uncovers information about Laura, helped by a portrait hanging on her living room wall, McPherson, like the men he interviews, becomes obsessed with the woman, as her delightful character, and her determined but innocent-like attractiveness envelops him. Clifton Webb's overtly dandy Waldo, a successful columnist, displays his love of Laura through his detailed recollections of their relationship, whilst the charming yet alarmingly vacant Shelby (Vincent Price), a man having affairs with noticeably more than one woman, is the more darkly sinister of the two, and often (perhaps innocently) implicates himself in the murder. About halfway through the film there is a huge narrative shift, which at first is jarring, as the audience is not sure if this is the fantasy or dream of McPherson, but the revelation shifts the story, questioning the reality of the two main suspects. As McPherson is drawn into the elusive Laura's lifestyle, the central focus of much of the narrative is set in the presence of a painting of Laura hanging in her room. It is an idealisation of the woman - she appears dominating in the picture - an image that is captured not by Laura, but by the men around her. This image is easier to handle that the real thing, it is a passive version of the woman. Whilst a lot is put upon the sexual power that Laura has on these men, it is the neuroses and imbalanced psyches of the men. But Laura, as we discover, is a more individual, independent woman, who perhaps does not require the desire of others. So the fantasised painted version of her can be contained and controlled. A reading could suggest that the power that Laura has over these men somehow perpetuates the incitement to murder, but in fact it would be easier to read that it is the breakdown of the masculine that is the determining factor in murder, and not necessarily a woman who is unsure of her decisions when it comes to settling. The performances are phenomenal here. Andrew's hard-boiled detective is excellent, with his proto-Columbo style of investigation, playing games with the suspects, and forcing them into corners. Price and Webb are brilliantly over-the-top - Price giving a sinister performance through the disguise of charisma. But, inevitably, the titular character, through the mysterious, seductive beauty of Tierney, is awesome in a tricksy way. She is not necessarily the traditional femme fatale, she is not consciously playing these men, yet at times the audience is unsure. Is she twisting the delusions of these men to her will? Or is she as sweet as she sometimes appears? It is an almost perfect performance. The influence of this film is undisputed. The James Elroy novel, The Black Dahlia, whilst loosely based on a true-life crime, was undoubtedly broadened by Laura's influence. The Black Dahlia has the central theme of the obsession by an investigator of a dead woman. These themes of obsession must have been directly correlated by David Lynch and Mark Frost when they wrote and conceived of Twin Peaks which began with the death of a high school girl, and the subsequent investigation unravels levels of obsession in a small community, much of which extended from this one girl. It's a wonderful, twisty, and often surprising story that illustrates that the power of women is not always a product of feminine knowing, but the failures and compulsions of weak, lonely men. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Let me horrify you from my first lines, so you can decide right now if you go on reading this review or you'll just pass: Laura is above all about sexual repression in the social upper crust in the 40s. Truth is, I've never seen a flick where it appears so evident that none of the main characters are doing it; or that they are doing it in a enjoyable way. Even worse, they are sublimating their libidosthat one I learned it in Secondary III, in Psychology class--falling in love, or fantasizing, about unreachable ones. If you don't believe it, just mention me a single occasion here where, as the saying goes, two sets of eyes find each other across a crowded room; when a man looks at a woman with lust in his eyes; when two hands rub each other by accident, trying to reach an astray for ex., and faces go red, hands tremble. Nope, there's absolutely no sexual tension in any scene here, no hint that any of these people have normal sexual lives. All you hear in its 87 min. is talk, talk, talk--which is the easiest way of getting rid of the excess libido. But, you'll argue, the same can be said of many flicks; like say, Guns of Navarone. That's true--but people there had good reasons as they were using their libidos to try to win a war. The difference in Laura is, all here are blatantly showcasing their needs, while at the same time trying by all means to have a substitute which would allow them the release without having to go through the experience itself. At its core, Laura is a scathing portrait of how unfulfilling the sex life of this crowd was at that epoch, despite all the ritzy appearances. Here the main focus of sublimated lust of every Joe is Laura herself, the incredibly beautiful yet sexually neutral, anodyne goddess to fantasize about but who'll turn into ashes--or stone?-as soon as you touch her.(this is not meant to be a criticism of Tierney, truly, but if she was such a hot ticket then is because her aseptic beauty fitted best the tastes and conventions of those puritanical, pre--Marilyn times in Hollywood). And of course women will fantasize about men they can't have. At the end the only real crime committed here is having them all licking their chops while not getting any. (BTW, in the original script Laura really died, which means McPherson fell in love with her portrait, following the norm). Now, about the technical aspect, the package, the cinematography, I'm not the first one to say it: Laura is all about style, about beautiful people in beautiful clothes parading in elegant surroundings, drinking champagne and carrying on their beautiful conversations. Speaking of which, I've never seen a flick with more contrived, unnatural, lines of dialog. I was checking all along and I could barely find any case in which a character was taken off guard by someone else's remark and had to pause, think, before giving an answer. It was just like a tennis match, snappy lines coming and going, as if the characters were all reading their lines which of course reveals the artificiality of the whole thing. As for Waldo I can't believe his insulting invectives could pass for witticism at any time, context, social milieu. Are they sure they consulted the right entry in Webster's? And man, does he sound like something is wrong with him. If someone came nowadays talking like that to a hotel desk they would make him lie down, give him some air and call a doctor. Where do they talk like that, in Mensa meetings, in the Save the Platypus organization?. And frankly I don't see this one as a noir. Rather as a flick that purposely started trying to be a noir only to lose its way going there and becoming entangled in a mess of assorted things: drama de moeurs (as the French say), faux--romance, crime thriller, social commentary. The only linking element being, as said, that the characters are not getting any. Noir characters need a least some depth, some dramatic reach, and these here are unbelievable in their shallowness and artificiality, more cardboard cuts than real people. Neither there's any atmosphere, no ambiance, no feel of impending doom. I didn't even feel for Laura when she was "arrested", as at that point I wasn't even looking at her as a real person, just as an image on a screen. Despite it all Laura is half-heartedly recommended, if only to know what the fuss is about. As a plus you have the typical Preminger direction, with his meticulous setting & framing of sceneswith his proverbial economy of shots, as we know--with his expert use of full bodied blacks along with resplendent whites. Most of the action unfolds in interiors, giving him the chance for indulging in luxurious surroundings--gorgeous sculptures, Ming vases, invaluable paintingsto the point that Laura's apartment looks like the ballroom of the Titanic. Or that was Waldo's bathroom...In any case, don't look for emotion, for sexual tension or for depth here. There's no one single relationship having any of that; they all look contrived, specially that of the leads. Just picture it: Laura sees as proof of the cop's love the fact that he arrests her for murder, so he can show her his feelings "in an more official setting". If that doesn't turn you away, then give it a try. 6.0/10.

    This is definitely one of the finest crime thrillers of its times. Otto Preminger was able to direct a movie that is gripping and very mysterious because of the storyline, and at the same time tremendously dialogue-oriented, because of its structure. He gave this noir movie a fine European touch, mainly due to the fact that there aren't any spectacular gun fights, chases or on-screen murders, but the emphasis is put on dialogues, which encourage one's imagination to produce vivid images of the crime. It's a tale of brutal murder, and huge obsession that lead to it. However, the unexpected turn, placed brilliantly somewhere in the middle of the movie, makes it even more suspenseful. The film makes a great use of various flashbacks to show the roots of this enormous obsession and jealousy coming from the side of Waldo Lydecker. Fine narrative voice-over that is somehow very similar to the one used later in Sunset Boulevard. It is supposed to set the mood and impose an intrigue that will satisfy the viewer and make him concentrated on every detail of the story. You can see the director's professionalism in every aspect of the film. For one, he makes a fascinating use of symbolism, and various elements that come with it (namely the two clocks), which ultimately lead to an important discovery, providing the horrifying explanation of this tough case. Dana Andrews is fantastic as a detective, who is serious about his job, but at the same time inescapably falls in love with the girl, whose murder he is investigating. He wants to show how tough and unemotional he can be when it comes to his line of work, but after some time the only thing he cares about is Laura and her safety. Talking about the titular girl: Gene Tierney is really appealing and convincing as pure, seemingly innocent and very amiable Laura. Her mesmerizing beauty makes it very easy to believe that every man falls in love with her right away and wants to have her only to himself. Clifton Webb is great as this really clever and wise writer, who with a little help of his huge intelligence and cunningness is able to convince everyone that he should be the least suspected person in the whole case. All in all, Laura is a very fine thriller with a properly developed plot and well-selected cast of characters. Everyone can be a suspect, just like in all the decent detective tale that you will find. But the somber atmosphere surrounding the story and incredible jealousy and obsessive behavior depicted in it provide for a noir title that everybody should see at least once.

    Laura Hunt is a young, beautiful, hugely successful New York advertising executive. Or rather she was those things. Because as this movie opens Laura is dead. Murdered, a shotgun blast to the face. So who was Laura really? What do we really know about her? Those are intriguing questions. But this movie's big question is of course who killed her? The mystery unfolds with a small handful of suspects and an at times rather peculiar investigation. Along the way we have some flashbacks to help establish who Laura was, how our suspects were connected to her, and why anyone could have possibly wanted to blow this seemingly innocent woman's head off. Because on the surface her murder makes very little sense. As you try to make some sense of it all the movie has some big surprises in store for you. Dana Andrews plays the role of detective Mark McPherson, who in the course of his investigation does some rather unusual things. Things which quite frankly no detective would ever actually do. But we will see he must do these things to move the movie's plot forward. Without this series of contrivances there would be no movie. Rather sloppy plotting it must be said but not so bad as to greatly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. One of McPherson's absurd actions is to allow one of his prime suspects to tag along for interrogations of his other prime suspects. A very contrived way to get all the key players in a room together. That prime suspect is newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker, the man responsible for making Laura who she was. Just ask him, he'll tell you. He loves talking about himself that's for sure. Clifton Webb plays this flamboyant, rather effeminate character. Waldo prances through the movie like a queen but it is apparent that he was quite in love with Laura. Which makes the fact that Laura was about to marry another man quite unacceptable in Waldo's eyes. The man Laura intended to marry is Shelby Carpenter, a not particularly intelligent country bumpkin who somehow finds himself moving in Manhattan's highest social circles. But did Laura really intend to marry Shelby? Waldo would have you believe she was reconsidering the marriage. If Shelby knew that he might certainly have a motive for the murder. Meanwhile Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell, has a thing for Shelby so maybe she wanted Laura out of the way. And Laura's maid also seemed to have an unusually strong affection for Laura. So there are the suspects. The movie then goes through a series of twists and turns, one of which is a real doozy, before all will finally be revealed. This is an intriguing movie but perhaps not quite as engrossing as it may have been. Even at less than ninety minutes the movie seems a bit slow and labored at times. The fact that some of the key story elements are scarcely believable doesn't help. Andrews does an OK job in playing the movie's detective but the fact that detective does so many frankly stupid things sometimes makes it hard to take the guy seriously. Webb floats through the movie on a cloud, chewing as much scenery as he can swallow. But his performance does make for a memorable character. The problem is that when you see Webb's 50-something Waldo with Gene Tierney's beautiful 20-something Laura the love story doesn't ring true. The oddest of odd couples. Then again while Laura had affection for Waldo she was after all intending to marry another man. So it's apparently unrequited love on Waldo's part. That other man, Shelby, is played by Vincent Price. It's not always easy playing a hapless dunce and that's pretty much what Shelby is. But Price does very well in the role. As the aunt and the maid Judith Anderson and Dorothy Adams respectively have less to do. They're pushed forward as possible suspects but the movie focuses most of its attention on Waldo and Shelby. Laura herself gets a little lost but Tierney certainly holds her own when she gets her opportunities. This is a movie which wants to keep you guessing but it doesn't always succeed in that. It certainly surprises you here and there but by the end there's a creeping sense of inevitability. Most in the audience will probably guess the murderer's identity before the movie's detective does. When we get to that ending we find it's just as contrived as much of what has preceded it. Instead of going out with a bang the movie fizzles out in what is slightly disappointing fashion. This isn't a bad murder mystery but it would be hard to call it a truly great one. It has its intriguing elements but the whole ends up being a little less than the sum of its parts.

    Provocative Mystery and Stylish Glamour; Glorious Portrait and Haunting Score

    A portrait, a painting, a piece of art have always played a decisive role in addressing our emotions and leading our thoughts to some 'idealized reality.' A beautiful woman in the painting has been a focus of interest...men admired her, women envied her; yet both have been affected by her glamor, mystery, detail and style. "A passion for the unavailable," as Petrarch once described the name Laura, is precisely what we encounter in this powerful film noir of the 1940s where one of the most beautiful actresses, Gene Tierney, at last decided to "play a painting." But is it only the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who makes this film one of the most aesthetic and fabulous screen productions? Is the widespread appreciation and applause dedicated only to her? All the merits of the film appear to focus on PORTRAIT, SCORE and ATMOSPHERE. These three aspects, as certain details, seem to create the harmony of the general conclusion after viewing LAURA. As a film noir (one of its very best manifestations), LAURA emphasizes the portrait of "a woman of mystery and glamor" (Gene Tierney)...an advertising executive whom we get to know with New York police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews). Just for curiosity, the portrait was initially painted by director Rouben Mamoulian's wife (first director of the movie) but...as a matter of fact, what we actually find in the movie is a blowup of Gene Tierney's photograph. The portrait leads us to the specific atmosphere of tension, suspicion, glamor, haunt, mystery and the unpredictable effects of murder investigation...the atmosphere at its best! This atmosphere is enriched by magnificent score, a unique work by David Raksin, a novelty at that time promoted by the composer for Fox studio Alfred Newman. His score supplies us with unforgettable feelings while watching the movie and helps the viewers keep interest and suspicion. It beautifully adapts detective elements, sexual references and a sentiment to the scenes. To enrich the atmosphere, we also need to add the flashbacks that play an important role in the movie and explain a lot in discovering the events as well as lead us to a certain reality and emotions. Also, the moody scenes with stunning cinematography add certain moods and resemblance. Another significant aspect of LAURA's artistry are, of course, the performances. Although there are practically not many characters in the movie, casting occurred to be pretty challenging. It is important to keep in mind that the author of the novel, Vera Caspary, badly wanted a screen adaptation but had her word in many decisions, including the portrayals of characters. After the long and tedious process of casting (even Marlene Dietrich was willing to play the lead), the results are fabulous. Gene Tierney portrays a sophisticated woman of the high society, no naive woman, no femme fatale but a strong woman who gets balanced among three men our attention is called upon: the newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) whose vicious charm shapes her decisions and who has, indeed, the strongest power in her life; her fianc&eacute; Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a gentle man who "would not even kill a fly" and the police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) who suspects no one and everyone at the same time. In between the men comes her wealthy aunt, Ann Treadwell memorably portrayed by the highly respected actress whose career illumined both the stage and cinema, Judith Anderson. However, let me consider the male performances in more details. Dana Andrews does a brilliant job as the detective making us not only the observers of the investigation but, thanks to the powerful and effective depiction of indefatigable determination, he lets us into his world where women are 'dames' and where suspicions are daily bread. The most unforgettable scene is when he enters Laura's apartment and the emphasis on details, the dream-like tension and his instantaneous movements occur to be the clarity with no words. Clifton Webb, who portrays the most difficult character, in fact, excellently combines the wretchedness with sympathy, doubt with certainty. He is not a villain and he does not look to be one... He is a man of power, a man of talent, a man of self esteem and mannerisms. He even becomes respectable, even in the eyes of the most suspicious viewers until... Vincent Price has his moments in the film, he is vibrant and genuine in the role; a young and inexperienced in man-woman relation? A little but shy? It occurs quite meaningful to state that both Clifton Webb and Vincent Price started their careers from supporting roles and then became legendary. However, there is yet another legendary name in LAURA that makes this film stand out as a historic production...that is the "tireless" (according to Gene Tierney) director Otto Preminger. Vincent Price memorably stated: "Otto Preminger had an implicit knowledge of pseudo-sophisticated world" and supplied the characters with the 'sense of evil' not making anyone villains. Preminger's great achievement is the fact that he managed to combine a detective story with psychology. His direction makes the film both sophisticated and romantic...I don't doubt that Rouben Mamoulian with his exquisite talents would also have managed that stylish element (he proved that in DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE)...yet, some of his requirements occurred to be of little use for the crew and the author herself. LAURA is a great atmospheric film noir, a provocative mystery combined with the stylish glamor where the haunting score leads us to the glorious portrait of female charm and mystery. 9/10

    Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been murdered, and as New York City Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigates, he finds that everyone seems to be in love with her -- and he, too, gradually falls under her spell. But things aren't always what they seem. Darryl F. Zanuck was opposed to casting Clifton Webb because of his known homosexuality, but Preminger prevailed and the 54-year-old Webb, making his first screen appearance since the silent era, was nominated for an Oscar. Webb really does sell the film, with lines like, "Will you stop calling her a dame? Does this look like the home of a dame? Have you ever known a woman who wasn't a doll or a dame?" Great dignified actor. And speaking of dignified, you have Vincent Price, young and without any facial hair, even before his voice achieved its full distinctiveness. Interestingly, he comes off as a wimp here and seems to go back and forth between stage and screen style acting. (Price always had a very stage quality to his film roles.) Does this film have a connection to "Twin Peaks"? A girl named Laura, murdered, with everyone attracted to her? I do not know... there is no direct connection, but it came to my mind.

    This movie reminds me of Casablanca in that it SHOULD have been just a run-of-the- mill noirish potboiler, but it ends up being so much more than that, thanks to a happy confluence of talents. Just as Bogart and Bergman, with the help of Claude Rains, raise Casablanca to sublimity, so too do Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney raise this material with the considerable help of Clifton Webb. The performances (Vincent Price and Judith Anderson in SUPPORTING roles!?!) mesh together like gears in a Rolex, and it's a pleasure to behold. I know it's been said before, but Gene Tierney's amazing looks make one believe that a detective could fall in love with her portrait. This movie is a superlative exemplar of its genre, and anyone who is a fan of that genre should do themselves a favor and see this film immediately.

    This movie fits on all counts but one! you could have a wild guess who the killer is, while the director tries to provide you with alternative versions to distract you. The movie starts out with the death of a Laura (Gene Tierney), and Detective Mc Pherson (Dana Andrews) trying to investigate the murder. The movie then goes on along McP's collection and rechecking evidence. He tries to soften the suspects by trash talk and trying to read into their reactions. Waldo and Shelby are both in the doubting list and confront McP many times. However, what follows is a classic Noir genre. The twist and the motives are good, effective and worth the 7/10. Looking back at the times when this movie was made, it deserves more than a 7! Hope you enjoy this as much as I have!

    LAURA is a really solid murder mystery with lots of clever dialog most of which are uttered by Clifton Webb's character. Gene Tierney oozes sex even though she is fully clothed all the time. Dana Andrews is tough as nails but his detective character wasn't too well developed. We know he isn't exactly a feminist (When a dame gets killed, she doesn't worry about how she looks.) And him falling in love with Laura was a bit hard to digest. The sinister ending is worth the price of admission. This is a great murder mystery. Obviously some of the characters are there just to make the plot more complicated. (7/10)

    I probably saw this first on TV as early as the 1950's. Have seen it many times since and can probably recite much of the dialog by heart. I agree with most of the positive reviews and I'm glad it has stood the test of time (considering the times in which it was made). I was a young girl so impressed, I named my first daughter, "Laura" -- as much for the beautiful theme as for the character. I also found and read the novel at a used book sale in the late '60s and owned an original copy of the sheet music. I was surprised to find out that this is considered a film noir classic. A film noir with a happy ending? Just the type of old classic movie to thrill a young girl's heart. My impressions then: Laura was a glamorous career woman -- even for the 1950's when I first encountered her, but I enjoyed Gene Tierney's movies, because I could identify with her. Much is said about her socialite and high class background and demure; however, she had an every girl quality too and many educated young women fancied themselves quite sophisticated a la Tierney. Beautiful yes, but there were many actresses even more beautiful. Don't forget the overbite. I most recently saw this movie in the past few years. Clifton Webb is the star of this movie -- a fine actor -- but he had the best lines by far. Vincent Price overacted (as he always did), and Dana Andrews literally sleepwalked (nothing new). Gene Tierney just glowed with star quality as ever. I love when old movies can just suggest what's happened thru dialog and acting, instead of beating you over the head and rubbing your face in it. But I did wonder, this time, what Mark and Laura would have in common or even to talk about once they rolled out of bed. Laura is a perfect movie for its time, but I don't believe it would impress my daughter. It would probably be a yawn.

    Laura was a project, based on a pulpy novel by Vera Caspery, that director Otto Preminger had to fight 20th Century Fox Mogul, Daryl Zanuck, to get made. It was a film that everyone else involved in did not believe in and assumed would be a failure. Yet the film went on to be a huge success and was a source of influence for countless film makers and endures as a classic of the golden era of Hollywood. On the face of it, Laura was in the mode of film noir, with the conventional detective investigating the murder of a glamorous and enthralling woman- as-femme-fatale; the film offers the usual twists in narrative structure and the dubious relationships and men surrounding the central figure, and their obsessions, or neuroses; but visually the film separates itself from the dark shadows and brooding atmosphere of the conventional noir films, and brings an obsessive, illuminating Freudian drama of sexual emasculation and the fundamental flaws of masculine desire. Dana Andrews's investigating detective McPherson, is assigned to the murder case of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), an assured, successful woman, surrounded by seemingly rich and powerful men, who was gunned down in her apartment. As he uncovers information about Laura, helped by a portrait hanging on her living room wall, McPherson, like the men he interviews, becomes obsessed with the woman, as her delightful character, and her determined but innocent-like attractiveness envelops him. Clifton Webb's overtly dandy Waldo, a successful columnist, displays his love of Laura through his detailed recollections of their relationship, whilst the charming yet alarmingly vacant Shelby (Vincent Price), a man having affairs with noticeably more than one woman, is the more darkly sinister of the two, and often (perhaps innocently) implicates himself in the murder. About halfway through the film there is a huge narrative shift, which at first is jarring, as the audience is not sure if this is the fantasy or dream of McPherson, but the revelation shifts the story, questioning the reality of the two main suspects. As McPherson is drawn into the elusive Laura's lifestyle, the central focus of much of the narrative is set in the presence of a painting of Laura hanging in her room. It is an idealisation of the woman - she appears dominating in the picture - an image that is captured not by Laura, but by the men around her. This image is easier to handle that the real thing, it is a passive version of the woman. Whilst a lot is put upon the sexual power that Laura has on these men, it is the neuroses and imbalanced psyches of the men. But Laura, as we discover, is a more individual, independent woman, who perhaps does not require the desire of others. So the fantasised painted version of her can be contained and controlled. A reading could suggest that the power that Laura has over these men somehow perpetuates the incitement to murder, but in fact it would be easier to read that it is the breakdown of the masculine that is the determining factor in murder, and not necessarily a woman who is unsure of her decisions when it comes to settling. The performances are phenomenal here. Andrew's hard-boiled detective is excellent, with his proto-Columbo style of investigation, playing games with the suspects, and forcing them into corners. Price and Webb are brilliantly over-the-top - Price giving a sinister performance through the disguise of charisma. But, inevitably, the titular character, through the mysterious, seductive beauty of Tierney, is awesome in a tricksy way. She is not necessarily the traditional femme fatale, she is not consciously playing these men, yet at times the audience is unsure. Is she twisting the delusions of these men to her will? Or is she as sweet as she sometimes appears? It is an almost perfect performance. The influence of this film is undisputed. The James Elroy novel, The Black Dahlia, whilst loosely based on a true-life crime, was undoubtedly broadened by Laura's influence. The Black Dahlia has the central theme of the obsession by an investigator of a dead woman. These themes of obsession must have been directly correlated by David Lynch and Mark Frost when they wrote and conceived of Twin Peaks which began with the death of a high school girl, and the subsequent investigation unravels levels of obsession in a small community, much of which extended from this one girl. It's a wonderful, twisty, and often surprising story that illustrates that the power of women is not always a product of feminine knowing, but the failures and compulsions of weak, lonely men. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Let me horrify you from my first lines, so you can decide right now if you go on reading this review or you'll just pass: Laura is above all about sexual repression in the social upper crust in the 40s. Truth is, I've never seen a flick where it appears so evident that none of the main characters are doing it; or that they are doing it in a enjoyable way. Even worse, they are sublimating their libidosthat one I learned it in Secondary III, in Psychology class--falling in love, or fantasizing, about unreachable ones. If you don't believe it, just mention me a single occasion here where, as the saying goes, two sets of eyes find each other across a crowded room; when a man looks at a woman with lust in his eyes; when two hands rub each other by accident, trying to reach an astray for ex., and faces go red, hands tremble. Nope, there's absolutely no sexual tension in any scene here, no hint that any of these people have normal sexual lives. All you hear in its 87 min. is talk, talk, talk--which is the easiest way of getting rid of the excess libido. But, you'll argue, the same can be said of many flicks; like say, Guns of Navarone. That's true--but people there had good reasons as they were using their libidos to try to win a war. The difference in Laura is, all here are blatantly showcasing their needs, while at the same time trying by all means to have a substitute which would allow them the release without having to go through the experience itself. At its core, Laura is a scathing portrait of how unfulfilling the sex life of this crowd was at that epoch, despite all the ritzy appearances. Here the main focus of sublimated lust of every Joe is Laura herself, the incredibly beautiful yet sexually neutral, anodyne goddess to fantasize about but who'll turn into ashes--or stone?-as soon as you touch her.(this is not meant to be a criticism of Tierney, truly, but if she was such a hot ticket then is because her aseptic beauty fitted best the tastes and conventions of those puritanical, pre--Marilyn times in Hollywood). And of course women will fantasize about men they can't have. At the end the only real crime committed here is having them all licking their chops while not getting any. (BTW, in the original script Laura really died, which means McPherson fell in love with her portrait, following the norm). Now, about the technical aspect, the package, the cinematography, I'm not the first one to say it: Laura is all about style, about beautiful people in beautiful clothes parading in elegant surroundings, drinking champagne and carrying on their beautiful conversations. Speaking of which, I've never seen a flick with more contrived, unnatural, lines of dialog. I was checking all along and I could barely find any case in which a character was taken off guard by someone else's remark and had to pause, think, before giving an answer. It was just like a tennis match, snappy lines coming and going, as if the characters were all reading their lines which of course reveals the artificiality of the whole thing. As for Waldo I can't believe his insulting invectives could pass for witticism at any time, context, social milieu. Are they sure they consulted the right entry in Webster's? And man, does he sound like something is wrong with him. If someone came nowadays talking like that to a hotel desk they would make him lie down, give him some air and call a doctor. Where do they talk like that, in Mensa meetings, in the Save the Platypus organization?. And frankly I don't see this one as a noir. Rather as a flick that purposely started trying to be a noir only to lose its way going there and becoming entangled in a mess of assorted things: drama de moeurs (as the French say), faux--romance, crime thriller, social commentary. The only linking element being, as said, that the characters are not getting any. Noir characters need a least some depth, some dramatic reach, and these here are unbelievable in their shallowness and artificiality, more cardboard cuts than real people. Neither there's any atmosphere, no ambiance, no feel of impending doom. I didn't even feel for Laura when she was "arrested", as at that point I wasn't even looking at her as a real person, just as an image on a screen. Despite it all Laura is half-heartedly recommended, if only to know what the fuss is about. As a plus you have the typical Preminger direction, with his meticulous setting & framing of sceneswith his proverbial economy of shots, as we know--with his expert use of full bodied blacks along with resplendent whites. Most of the action unfolds in interiors, giving him the chance for indulging in luxurious surroundings--gorgeous sculptures, Ming vases, invaluable paintingsto the point that Laura's apartment looks like the ballroom of the Titanic. Or that was Waldo's bathroom...In any case, don't look for emotion, for sexual tension or for depth here. There's no one single relationship having any of that; they all look contrived, specially that of the leads. Just picture it: Laura sees as proof of the cop's love the fact that he arrests her for murder, so he can show her his feelings "in an more official setting". If that doesn't turn you away, then give it a try. 6.0/10.

    This is definitely one of the finest crime thrillers of its times. Otto Preminger was able to direct a movie that is gripping and very mysterious because of the storyline, and at the same time tremendously dialogue-oriented, because of its structure. He gave this noir movie a fine European touch, mainly due to the fact that there aren't any spectacular gun fights, chases or on-screen murders, but the emphasis is put on dialogues, which encourage one's imagination to produce vivid images of the crime. It's a tale of brutal murder, and huge obsession that lead to it. However, the unexpected turn, placed brilliantly somewhere in the middle of the movie, makes it even more suspenseful. The film makes a great use of various flashbacks to show the roots of this enormous obsession and jealousy coming from the side of Waldo Lydecker. Fine narrative voice-over that is somehow very similar to the one used later in Sunset Boulevard. It is supposed to set the mood and impose an intrigue that will satisfy the viewer and make him concentrated on every detail of the story. You can see the director's professionalism in every aspect of the film. For one, he makes a fascinating use of symbolism, and various elements that come with it (namely the two clocks), which ultimately lead to an important discovery, providing the horrifying explanation of this tough case. Dana Andrews is fantastic as a detective, who is serious about his job, but at the same time inescapably falls in love with the girl, whose murder he is investigating. He wants to show how tough and unemotional he can be when it comes to his line of work, but after some time the only thing he cares about is Laura and her safety. Talking about the titular girl: Gene Tierney is really appealing and convincing as pure, seemingly innocent and very amiable Laura. Her mesmerizing beauty makes it very easy to believe that every man falls in love with her right away and wants to have her only to himself. Clifton Webb is great as this really clever and wise writer, who with a little help of his huge intelligence and cunningness is able to convince everyone that he should be the least suspected person in the whole case. All in all, Laura is a very fine thriller with a properly developed plot and well-selected cast of characters. Everyone can be a suspect, just like in all the decent detective tale that you will find. But the somber atmosphere surrounding the story and incredible jealousy and obsessive behavior depicted in it provide for a noir title that everybody should see at least once.

    Laura Hunt is a young, beautiful, hugely successful New York advertising executive. Or rather she was those things. Because as this movie opens Laura is dead. Murdered, a shotgun blast to the face. So who was Laura really? What do we really know about her? Those are intriguing questions. But this movie's big question is of course who killed her? The mystery unfolds with a small handful of suspects and an at times rather peculiar investigation. Along the way we have some flashbacks to help establish who Laura was, how our suspects were connected to her, and why anyone could have possibly wanted to blow this seemingly innocent woman's head off. Because on the surface her murder makes very little sense. As you try to make some sense of it all the movie has some big surprises in store for you. Dana Andrews plays the role of detective Mark McPherson, who in the course of his investigation does some rather unusual things. Things which quite frankly no detective would ever actually do. But we will see he must do these things to move the movie's plot forward. Without this series of contrivances there would be no movie. Rather sloppy plotting it must be said but not so bad as to greatly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. One of McPherson's absurd actions is to allow one of his prime suspects to tag along for interrogations of his other prime suspects. A very contrived way to get all the key players in a room together. That prime suspect is newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker, the man responsible for making Laura who she was. Just ask him, he'll tell you. He loves talking about himself that's for sure. Clifton Webb plays this flamboyant, rather effeminate character. Waldo prances through the movie like a queen but it is apparent that he was quite in love with Laura. Which makes the fact that Laura was about to marry another man quite unacceptable in Waldo's eyes. The man Laura intended to marry is Shelby Carpenter, a not particularly intelligent country bumpkin who somehow finds himself moving in Manhattan's highest social circles. But did Laura really intend to marry Shelby? Waldo would have you believe she was reconsidering the marriage. If Shelby knew that he might certainly have a motive for the murder. Meanwhile Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell, has a thing for Shelby so maybe she wanted Laura out of the way. And Laura's maid also seemed to have an unusually strong affection for Laura. So there are the suspects. The movie then goes through a series of twists and turns, one of which is a real doozy, before all will finally be revealed. This is an intriguing movie but perhaps not quite as engrossing as it may have been. Even at less than ninety minutes the movie seems a bit slow and labored at times. The fact that some of the key story elements are scarcely believable doesn't help. Andrews does an OK job in playing the movie's detective but the fact that detective does so many frankly stupid things sometimes makes it hard to take the guy seriously. Webb floats through the movie on a cloud, chewing as much scenery as he can swallow. But his performance does make for a memorable character. The problem is that when you see Webb's 50-something Waldo with Gene Tierney's beautiful 20-something Laura the love story doesn't ring true. The oddest of odd couples. Then again while Laura had affection for Waldo she was after all intending to marry another man. So it's apparently unrequited love on Waldo's part. That other man, Shelby, is played by Vincent Price. It's not always easy playing a hapless dunce and that's pretty much what Shelby is. But Price does very well in the role. As the aunt and the maid Judith Anderson and Dorothy Adams respectively have less to do. They're pushed forward as possible suspects but the movie focuses most of its attention on Waldo and Shelby. Laura herself gets a little lost but Tierney certainly holds her own when she gets her opportunities. This is a movie which wants to keep you guessing but it doesn't always succeed in that. It certainly surprises you here and there but by the end there's a creeping sense of inevitability. Most in the audience will probably guess the murderer's identity before the movie's detective does. When we get to that ending we find it's just as contrived as much of what has preceded it. Instead of going out with a bang the movie fizzles out in what is slightly disappointing fashion. This isn't a bad murder mystery but it would be hard to call it a truly great one. It has its intriguing elements but the whole ends up being a little less than the sum of its parts.

    Provocative Mystery and Stylish Glamour; Glorious Portrait and Haunting Score

    A portrait, a painting, a piece of art have always played a decisive role in addressing our emotions and leading our thoughts to some 'idealized reality.' A beautiful woman in the painting has been a focus of interest...men admired her, women envied her; yet both have been affected by her glamor, mystery, detail and style. "A passion for the unavailable," as Petrarch once described the name Laura, is precisely what we encounter in this powerful film noir of the 1940s where one of the most beautiful actresses, Gene Tierney, at last decided to "play a painting." But is it only the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who makes this film one of the most aesthetic and fabulous screen productions? Is the widespread appreciation and applause dedicated only to her? All the merits of the film appear to focus on PORTRAIT, SCORE and ATMOSPHERE. These three aspects, as certain details, seem to create the harmony of the general conclusion after viewing LAURA. As a film noir (one of its very best manifestations), LAURA emphasizes the portrait of "a woman of mystery and glamor" (Gene Tierney)...an advertising executive whom we get to know with New York police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews). Just for curiosity, the portrait was initially painted by director Rouben Mamoulian's wife (first director of the movie) but...as a matter of fact, what we actually find in the movie is a blowup of Gene Tierney's photograph. The portrait leads us to the specific atmosphere of tension, suspicion, glamor, haunt, mystery and the unpredictable effects of murder investigation...the atmosphere at its best! This atmosphere is enriched by magnificent score, a unique work by David Raksin, a novelty at that time promoted by the composer for Fox studio Alfred Newman. His score supplies us with unforgettable feelings while watching the movie and helps the viewers keep interest and suspicion. It beautifully adapts detective elements, sexual references and a sentiment to the scenes. To enrich the atmosphere, we also need to add the flashbacks that play an important role in the movie and explain a lot in discovering the events as well as lead us to a certain reality and emotions. Also, the moody scenes with stunning cinematography add certain moods and resemblance. Another significant aspect of LAURA's artistry are, of course, the performances. Although there are practically not many characters in the movie, casting occurred to be pretty challenging. It is important to keep in mind that the author of the novel, Vera Caspary, badly wanted a screen adaptation but had her word in many decisions, including the portrayals of characters. After the long and tedious process of casting (even Marlene Dietrich was willing to play the lead), the results are fabulous. Gene Tierney portrays a sophisticated woman of the high society, no naive woman, no femme fatale but a strong woman who gets balanced among three men our attention is called upon: the newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) whose vicious charm shapes her decisions and who has, indeed, the strongest power in her life; her fianc&eacute; Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a gentle man who "would not even kill a fly" and the police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) who suspects no one and everyone at the same time. In between the men comes her wealthy aunt, Ann Treadwell memorably portrayed by the highly respected actress whose career illumined both the stage and cinema, Judith Anderson. However, let me consider the male performances in more details. Dana Andrews does a brilliant job as the detective making us not only the observers of the investigation but, thanks to the powerful and effective depiction of indefatigable determination, he lets us into his world where women are 'dames' and where suspicions are daily bread. The most unforgettable scene is when he enters Laura's apartment and the emphasis on details, the dream-like tension and his instantaneous movements occur to be the clarity with no words. Clifton Webb, who portrays the most difficult character, in fact, excellently combines the wretchedness with sympathy, doubt with certainty. He is not a villain and he does not look to be one... He is a man of power, a man of talent, a man of self esteem and mannerisms. He even becomes respectable, even in the eyes of the most suspicious viewers until... Vincent Price has his moments in the film, he is vibrant and genuine in the role; a young and inexperienced in man-woman relation? A little but shy? It occurs quite meaningful to state that both Clifton Webb and Vincent Price started their careers from supporting roles and then became legendary. However, there is yet another legendary name in LAURA that makes this film stand out as a historic production...that is the "tireless" (according to Gene Tierney) director Otto Preminger. Vincent Price memorably stated: "Otto Preminger had an implicit knowledge of pseudo-sophisticated world" and supplied the characters with the 'sense of evil' not making anyone villains. Preminger's great achievement is the fact that he managed to combine a detective story with psychology. His direction makes the film both sophisticated and romantic...I don't doubt that Rouben Mamoulian with his exquisite talents would also have managed that stylish element (he proved that in DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE)...yet, some of his requirements occurred to be of little use for the crew and the author herself. LAURA is a great atmospheric film noir, a provocative mystery combined with the stylish glamor where the haunting score leads us to the glorious portrait of female charm and mystery. 9/10

    Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been murdered, and as New York City Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigates, he finds that everyone seems to be in love with her -- and he, too, gradually falls under her spell. But things aren't always what they seem. Darryl F. Zanuck was opposed to casting Clifton Webb because of his known homosexuality, but Preminger prevailed and the 54-year-old Webb, making his first screen appearance since the silent era, was nominated for an Oscar. Webb really does sell the film, with lines like, "Will you stop calling her a dame? Does this look like the home of a dame? Have you ever known a woman who wasn't a doll or a dame?" Great dignified actor. And speaking of dignified, you have Vincent Price, young and without any facial hair, even before his voice achieved its full distinctiveness. Interestingly, he comes off as a wimp here and seems to go back and forth between stage and screen style acting. (Price always had a very stage quality to his film roles.) Does this film have a connection to "Twin Peaks"? A girl named Laura, murdered, with everyone attracted to her? I do not know... there is no direct connection, but it came to my mind.

    This movie reminds me of Casablanca in that it SHOULD have been just a run-of-the- mill noirish potboiler, but it ends up being so much more than that, thanks to a happy confluence of talents. Just as Bogart and Bergman, with the help of Claude Rains, raise Casablanca to sublimity, so too do Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney raise this material with the considerable help of Clifton Webb. The performances (Vincent Price and Judith Anderson in SUPPORTING roles!?!) mesh together like gears in a Rolex, and it's a pleasure to behold. I know it's been said before, but Gene Tierney's amazing looks make one believe that a detective could fall in love with her portrait. This movie is a superlative exemplar of its genre, and anyone who is a fan of that genre should do themselves a favor and see this film immediately.

    This movie fits on all counts but one! you could have a wild guess who the killer is, while the director tries to provide you with alternative versions to distract you. The movie starts out with the death of a Laura (Gene Tierney), and Detective Mc Pherson (Dana Andrews) trying to investigate the murder. The movie then goes on along McP's collection and rechecking evidence. He tries to soften the suspects by trash talk and trying to read into their reactions. Waldo and Shelby are both in the doubting list and confront McP many times. However, what follows is a classic Noir genre. The twist and the motives are good, effective and worth the 7/10. Looking back at the times when this movie was made, it deserves more than a 7! Hope you enjoy this as much as I have!

    LAURA is a really solid murder mystery with lots of clever dialog most of which are uttered by Clifton Webb's character. Gene Tierney oozes sex even though she is fully clothed all the time. Dana Andrews is tough as nails but his detective character wasn't too well developed. We know he isn't exactly a feminist (When a dame gets killed, she doesn't worry about how she looks.) And him falling in love with Laura was a bit hard to digest. The sinister ending is worth the price of admission. This is a great murder mystery. Obviously some of the characters are there just to make the plot more complicated. (7/10)

    I probably saw this first on TV as early as the 1950's. Have seen it many times since and can probably recite much of the dialog by heart. I agree with most of the positive reviews and I'm glad it has stood the test of time (considering the times in which it was made). I was a young girl so impressed, I named my first daughter, "Laura" -- as much for the beautiful theme as for the character. I also found and read the novel at a used book sale in the late '60s and owned an original copy of the sheet music. I was surprised to find out that this is considered a film noir classic. A film noir with a happy ending? Just the type of old classic movie to thrill a young girl's heart. My impressions then: Laura was a glamorous career woman -- even for the 1950's when I first encountered her, but I enjoyed Gene Tierney's movies, because I could identify with her. Much is said about her socialite and high class background and demure; however, she had an every girl quality too and many educated young women fancied themselves quite sophisticated a la Tierney. Beautiful yes, but there were many actresses even more beautiful. Don't forget the overbite. I most recently saw this movie in the past few years. Clifton Webb is the star of this movie -- a fine actor -- but he had the best lines by far. Vincent Price overacted (as he always did), and Dana Andrews literally sleepwalked (nothing new). Gene Tierney just glowed with star quality as ever. I love when old movies can just suggest what's happened thru dialog and acting, instead of beating you over the head and rubbing your face in it. But I did wonder, this time, what Mark and Laura would have in common or even to talk about once they rolled out of bed. Laura is a perfect movie for its time, but I don't believe it would impress my daughter. It would probably be a yawn.

    Laura was a project, based on a pulpy novel by Vera Caspery, that director Otto Preminger had to fight 20th Century Fox Mogul, Daryl Zanuck, to get made. It was a film that everyone else involved in did not believe in and assumed would be a failure. Yet the film went on to be a huge success and was a source of influence for countless film makers and endures as a classic of the golden era of Hollywood. On the face of it, Laura was in the mode of film noir, with the conventional detective investigating the murder of a glamorous and enthralling woman- as-femme-fatale; the film offers the usual twists in narrative structure and the dubious relationships and men surrounding the central figure, and their obsessions, or neuroses; but visually the film separates itself from the dark shadows and brooding atmosphere of the conventional noir films, and brings an obsessive, illuminating Freudian drama of sexual emasculation and the fundamental flaws of masculine desire. Dana Andrews's investigating detective McPherson, is assigned to the murder case of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), an assured, successful woman, surrounded by seemingly rich and powerful men, who was gunned down in her apartment. As he uncovers information about Laura, helped by a portrait hanging on her living room wall, McPherson, like the men he interviews, becomes obsessed with the woman, as her delightful character, and her determined but innocent-like attractiveness envelops him. Clifton Webb's overtly dandy Waldo, a successful columnist, displays his love of Laura through his detailed recollections of their relationship, whilst the charming yet alarmingly vacant Shelby (Vincent Price), a man having affairs with noticeably more than one woman, is the more darkly sinister of the two, and often (perhaps innocently) implicates himself in the murder. About halfway through the film there is a huge narrative shift, which at first is jarring, as the audience is not sure if this is the fantasy or dream of McPherson, but the revelation shifts the story, questioning the reality of the two main suspects. As McPherson is drawn into the elusive Laura's lifestyle, the central focus of much of the narrative is set in the presence of a painting of Laura hanging in her room. It is an idealisation of the woman - she appears dominating in the picture - an image that is captured not by Laura, but by the men around her. This image is easier to handle that the real thing, it is a passive version of the woman. Whilst a lot is put upon the sexual power that Laura has on these men, it is the neuroses and imbalanced psyches of the men. But Laura, as we discover, is a more individual, independent woman, who perhaps does not require the desire of others. So the fantasised painted version of her can be contained and controlled. A reading could suggest that the power that Laura has over these men somehow perpetuates the incitement to murder, but in fact it would be easier to read that it is the breakdown of the masculine that is the determining factor in murder, and not necessarily a woman who is unsure of her decisions when it comes to settling. The performances are phenomenal here. Andrew's hard-boiled detective is excellent, with his proto-Columbo style of investigation, playing games with the suspects, and forcing them into corners. Price and Webb are brilliantly over-the-top - Price giving a sinister performance through the disguise of charisma. But, inevitably, the titular character, through the mysterious, seductive beauty of Tierney, is awesome in a tricksy way. She is not necessarily the traditional femme fatale, she is not consciously playing these men, yet at times the audience is unsure. Is she twisting the delusions of these men to her will? Or is she as sweet as she sometimes appears? It is an almost perfect performance. The influence of this film is undisputed. The James Elroy novel, The Black Dahlia, whilst loosely based on a true-life crime, was undoubtedly broadened by Laura's influence. The Black Dahlia has the central theme of the obsession by an investigator of a dead woman. These themes of obsession must have been directly correlated by David Lynch and Mark Frost when they wrote and conceived of Twin Peaks which began with the death of a high school girl, and the subsequent investigation unravels levels of obsession in a small community, much of which extended from this one girl. It's a wonderful, twisty, and often surprising story that illustrates that the power of women is not always a product of feminine knowing, but the failures and compulsions of weak, lonely men. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Let me horrify you from my first lines, so you can decide right now if you go on reading this review or you'll just pass: Laura is above all about sexual repression in the social upper crust in the 40s. Truth is, I've never seen a flick where it appears so evident that none of the main characters are doing it; or that they are doing it in a enjoyable way. Even worse, they are sublimating their libidosthat one I learned it in Secondary III, in Psychology class--falling in love, or fantasizing, about unreachable ones. If you don't believe it, just mention me a single occasion here where, as the saying goes, two sets of eyes find each other across a crowded room; when a man looks at a woman with lust in his eyes; when two hands rub each other by accident, trying to reach an astray for ex., and faces go red, hands tremble. Nope, there's absolutely no sexual tension in any scene here, no hint that any of these people have normal sexual lives. All you hear in its 87 min. is talk, talk, talk--which is the easiest way of getting rid of the excess libido. But, you'll argue, the same can be said of many flicks; like say, Guns of Navarone. That's true--but people there had good reasons as they were using their libidos to try to win a war. The difference in Laura is, all here are blatantly showcasing their needs, while at the same time trying by all means to have a substitute which would allow them the release without having to go through the experience itself. At its core, Laura is a scathing portrait of how unfulfilling the sex life of this crowd was at that epoch, despite all the ritzy appearances. Here the main focus of sublimated lust of every Joe is Laura herself, the incredibly beautiful yet sexually neutral, anodyne goddess to fantasize about but who'll turn into ashes--or stone?-as soon as you touch her.(this is not meant to be a criticism of Tierney, truly, but if she was such a hot ticket then is because her aseptic beauty fitted best the tastes and conventions of those puritanical, pre--Marilyn times in Hollywood). And of course women will fantasize about men they can't have. At the end the only real crime committed here is having them all licking their chops while not getting any. (BTW, in the original script Laura really died, which means McPherson fell in love with her portrait, following the norm). Now, about the technical aspect, the package, the cinematography, I'm not the first one to say it: Laura is all about style, about beautiful people in beautiful clothes parading in elegant surroundings, drinking champagne and carrying on their beautiful conversations. Speaking of which, I've never seen a flick with more contrived, unnatural, lines of dialog. I was checking all along and I could barely find any case in which a character was taken off guard by someone else's remark and had to pause, think, before giving an answer. It was just like a tennis match, snappy lines coming and going, as if the characters were all reading their lines which of course reveals the artificiality of the whole thing. As for Waldo I can't believe his insulting invectives could pass for witticism at any time, context, social milieu. Are they sure they consulted the right entry in Webster's? And man, does he sound like something is wrong with him. If someone came nowadays talking like that to a hotel desk they would make him lie down, give him some air and call a doctor. Where do they talk like that, in Mensa meetings, in the Save the Platypus organization?. And frankly I don't see this one as a noir. Rather as a flick that purposely started trying to be a noir only to lose its way going there and becoming entangled in a mess of assorted things: drama de moeurs (as the French say), faux--romance, crime thriller, social commentary. The only linking element being, as said, that the characters are not getting any. Noir characters need a least some depth, some dramatic reach, and these here are unbelievable in their shallowness and artificiality, more cardboard cuts than real people. Neither there's any atmosphere, no ambiance, no feel of impending doom. I didn't even feel for Laura when she was "arrested", as at that point I wasn't even looking at her as a real person, just as an image on a screen. Despite it all Laura is half-heartedly recommended, if only to know what the fuss is about. As a plus you have the typical Preminger direction, with his meticulous setting & framing of sceneswith his proverbial economy of shots, as we know--with his expert use of full bodied blacks along with resplendent whites. Most of the action unfolds in interiors, giving him the chance for indulging in luxurious surroundings--gorgeous sculptures, Ming vases, invaluable paintingsto the point that Laura's apartment looks like the ballroom of the Titanic. Or that was Waldo's bathroom...In any case, don't look for emotion, for sexual tension or for depth here. There's no one single relationship having any of that; they all look contrived, specially that of the leads. Just picture it: Laura sees as proof of the cop's love the fact that he arrests her for murder, so he can show her his feelings "in an more official setting". If that doesn't turn you away, then give it a try. 6.0/10.

    This is definitely one of the finest crime thrillers of its times. Otto Preminger was able to direct a movie that is gripping and very mysterious because of the storyline, and at the same time tremendously dialogue-oriented, because of its structure. He gave this noir movie a fine European touch, mainly due to the fact that there aren't any spectacular gun fights, chases or on-screen murders, but the emphasis is put on dialogues, which encourage one's imagination to produce vivid images of the crime. It's a tale of brutal murder, and huge obsession that lead to it. However, the unexpected turn, placed brilliantly somewhere in the middle of the movie, makes it even more suspenseful. The film makes a great use of various flashbacks to show the roots of this enormous obsession and jealousy coming from the side of Waldo Lydecker. Fine narrative voice-over that is somehow very similar to the one used later in Sunset Boulevard. It is supposed to set the mood and impose an intrigue that will satisfy the viewer and make him concentrated on every detail of the story. You can see the director's professionalism in every aspect of the film. For one, he makes a fascinating use of symbolism, and various elements that come with it (namely the two clocks), which ultimately lead to an important discovery, providing the horrifying explanation of this tough case. Dana Andrews is fantastic as a detective, who is serious about his job, but at the same time inescapably falls in love with the girl, whose murder he is investigating. He wants to show how tough and unemotional he can be when it comes to his line of work, but after some time the only thing he cares about is Laura and her safety. Talking about the titular girl: Gene Tierney is really appealing and convincing as pure, seemingly innocent and very amiable Laura. Her mesmerizing beauty makes it very easy to believe that every man falls in love with her right away and wants to have her only to himself. Clifton Webb is great as this really clever and wise writer, who with a little help of his huge intelligence and cunningness is able to convince everyone that he should be the least suspected person in the whole case. All in all, Laura is a very fine thriller with a properly developed plot and well-selected cast of characters. Everyone can be a suspect, just like in all the decent detective tale that you will find. But the somber atmosphere surrounding the story and incredible jealousy and obsessive behavior depicted in it provide for a noir title that everybody should see at least once.

    Laura Hunt is a young, beautiful, hugely successful New York advertising executive. Or rather she was those things. Because as this movie opens Laura is dead. Murdered, a shotgun blast to the face. So who was Laura really? What do we really know about her? Those are intriguing questions. But this movie's big question is of course who killed her? The mystery unfolds with a small handful of suspects and an at times rather peculiar investigation. Along the way we have some flashbacks to help establish who Laura was, how our suspects were connected to her, and why anyone could have possibly wanted to blow this seemingly innocent woman's head off. Because on the surface her murder makes very little sense. As you try to make some sense of it all the movie has some big surprises in store for you. Dana Andrews plays the role of detective Mark McPherson, who in the course of his investigation does some rather unusual things. Things which quite frankly no detective would ever actually do. But we will see he must do these things to move the movie's plot forward. Without this series of contrivances there would be no movie. Rather sloppy plotting it must be said but not so bad as to greatly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. One of McPherson's absurd actions is to allow one of his prime suspects to tag along for interrogations of his other prime suspects. A very contrived way to get all the key players in a room together. That prime suspect is newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker, the man responsible for making Laura who she was. Just ask him, he'll tell you. He loves talking about himself that's for sure. Clifton Webb plays this flamboyant, rather effeminate character. Waldo prances through the movie like a queen but it is apparent that he was quite in love with Laura. Which makes the fact that Laura was about to marry another man quite unacceptable in Waldo's eyes. The man Laura intended to marry is Shelby Carpenter, a not particularly intelligent country bumpkin who somehow finds himself moving in Manhattan's highest social circles. But did Laura really intend to marry Shelby? Waldo would have you believe she was reconsidering the marriage. If Shelby knew that he might certainly have a motive for the murder. Meanwhile Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell, has a thing for Shelby so maybe she wanted Laura out of the way. And Laura's maid also seemed to have an unusually strong affection for Laura. So there are the suspects. The movie then goes through a series of twists and turns, one of which is a real doozy, before all will finally be revealed. This is an intriguing movie but perhaps not quite as engrossing as it may have been. Even at less than ninety minutes the movie seems a bit slow and labored at times. The fact that some of the key story elements are scarcely believable doesn't help. Andrews does an OK job in playing the movie's detective but the fact that detective does so many frankly stupid things sometimes makes it hard to take the guy seriously. Webb floats through the movie on a cloud, chewing as much scenery as he can swallow. But his performance does make for a memorable character. The problem is that when you see Webb's 50-something Waldo with Gene Tierney's beautiful 20-something Laura the love story doesn't ring true. The oddest of odd couples. Then again while Laura had affection for Waldo she was after all intending to marry another man. So it's apparently unrequited love on Waldo's part. That other man, Shelby, is played by Vincent Price. It's not always easy playing a hapless dunce and that's pretty much what Shelby is. But Price does very well in the role. As the aunt and the maid Judith Anderson and Dorothy Adams respectively have less to do. They're pushed forward as possible suspects but the movie focuses most of its attention on Waldo and Shelby. Laura herself gets a little lost but Tierney certainly holds her own when she gets her opportunities. This is a movie which wants to keep you guessing but it doesn't always succeed in that. It certainly surprises you here and there but by the end there's a creeping sense of inevitability. Most in the audience will probably guess the murderer's identity before the movie's detective does. When we get to that ending we find it's just as contrived as much of what has preceded it. Instead of going out with a bang the movie fizzles out in what is slightly disappointing fashion. This isn't a bad murder mystery but it would be hard to call it a truly great one. It has its intriguing elements but the whole ends up being a little less than the sum of its parts.

    Provocative Mystery and Stylish Glamour; Glorious Portrait and Haunting Score

    A portrait, a painting, a piece of art have always played a decisive role in addressing our emotions and leading our thoughts to some 'idealized reality.' A beautiful woman in the painting has been a focus of interest...men admired her, women envied her; yet both have been affected by her glamor, mystery, detail and style. "A passion for the unavailable," as Petrarch once described the name Laura, is precisely what we encounter in this powerful film noir of the 1940s where one of the most beautiful actresses, Gene Tierney, at last decided to "play a painting." But is it only the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who makes this film one of the most aesthetic and fabulous screen productions? Is the widespread appreciation and applause dedicated only to her? All the merits of the film appear to focus on PORTRAIT, SCORE and ATMOSPHERE. These three aspects, as certain details, seem to create the harmony of the general conclusion after viewing LAURA. As a film noir (one of its very best manifestations), LAURA emphasizes the portrait of "a woman of mystery and glamor" (Gene Tierney)...an advertising executive whom we get to know with New York police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews). Just for curiosity, the portrait was initially painted by director Rouben Mamoulian's wife (first director of the movie) but...as a matter of fact, what we actually find in the movie is a blowup of Gene Tierney's photograph. The portrait leads us to the specific atmosphere of tension, suspicion, glamor, haunt, mystery and the unpredictable effects of murder investigation...the atmosphere at its best! This atmosphere is enriched by magnificent score, a unique work by David Raksin, a novelty at that time promoted by the composer for Fox studio Alfred Newman. His score supplies us with unforgettable feelings while watching the movie and helps the viewers keep interest and suspicion. It beautifully adapts detective elements, sexual references and a sentiment to the scenes. To enrich the atmosphere, we also need to add the flashbacks that play an important role in the movie and explain a lot in discovering the events as well as lead us to a certain reality and emotions. Also, the moody scenes with stunning cinematography add certain moods and resemblance. Another significant aspect of LAURA's artistry are, of course, the performances. Although there are practically not many characters in the movie, casting occurred to be pretty challenging. It is important to keep in mind that the author of the novel, Vera Caspary, badly wanted a screen adaptation but had her word in many decisions, including the portrayals of characters. After the long and tedious process of casting (even Marlene Dietrich was willing to play the lead), the results are fabulous. Gene Tierney portrays a sophisticated woman of the high society, no naive woman, no femme fatale but a strong woman who gets balanced among three men our attention is called upon: the newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) whose vicious charm shapes her decisions and who has, indeed, the strongest power in her life; her fianc&eacute; Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a gentle man who "would not even kill a fly" and the police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) who suspects no one and everyone at the same time. In between the men comes her wealthy aunt, Ann Treadwell memorably portrayed by the highly respected actress whose career illumined both the stage and cinema, Judith Anderson. However, let me consider the male performances in more details. Dana Andrews does a brilliant job as the detective making us not only the observers of the investigation but, thanks to the powerful and effective depiction of indefatigable determination, he lets us into his world where women are 'dames' and where suspicions are daily bread. The most unforgettable scene is when he enters Laura's apartment and the emphasis on details, the dream-like tension and his instantaneous movements occur to be the clarity with no words. Clifton Webb, who portrays the most difficult character, in fact, excellently combines the wretchedness with sympathy, doubt with certainty. He is not a villain and he does not look to be one... He is a man of power, a man of talent, a man of self esteem and mannerisms. He even becomes respectable, even in the eyes of the most suspicious viewers until... Vincent Price has his moments in the film, he is vibrant and genuine in the role; a young and inexperienced in man-woman relation? A little but shy? It occurs quite meaningful to state that both Clifton Webb and Vincent Price started their careers from supporting roles and then became legendary. However, there is yet another legendary name in LAURA that makes this film stand out as a historic production...that is the "tireless" (according to Gene Tierney) director Otto Preminger. Vincent Price memorably stated: "Otto Preminger had an implicit knowledge of pseudo-sophisticated world" and supplied the characters with the 'sense of evil' not making anyone villains. Preminger's great achievement is the fact that he managed to combine a detective story with psychology. His direction makes the film both sophisticated and romantic...I don't doubt that Rouben Mamoulian with his exquisite talents would also have managed that stylish element (he proved that in DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE)...yet, some of his requirements occurred to be of little use for the crew and the author herself. LAURA is a great atmospheric film noir, a provocative mystery combined with the stylish glamor where the haunting score leads us to the glorious portrait of female charm and mystery. 9/10

    Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been murdered, and as New York City Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigates, he finds that everyone seems to be in love with her -- and he, too, gradually falls under her spell. But things aren't always what they seem. Darryl F. Zanuck was opposed to casting Clifton Webb because of his known homosexuality, but Preminger prevailed and the 54-year-old Webb, making his first screen appearance since the silent era, was nominated for an Oscar. Webb really does sell the film, with lines like, "Will you stop calling her a dame? Does this look like the home of a dame? Have you ever known a woman who wasn't a doll or a dame?" Great dignified actor. And speaking of dignified, you have Vincent Price, young and without any facial hair, even before his voice achieved its full distinctiveness. Interestingly, he comes off as a wimp here and seems to go back and forth between stage and screen style acting. (Price always had a very stage quality to his film roles.) Does this film have a connection to "Twin Peaks"? A girl named Laura, murdered, with everyone attracted to her? I do not know... there is no direct connection, but it came to my mind.

    This movie reminds me of Casablanca in that it SHOULD have been just a run-of-the- mill noirish potboiler, but it ends up being so much more than that, thanks to a happy confluence of talents. Just as Bogart and Bergman, with the help of Claude Rains, raise Casablanca to sublimity, so too do Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney raise this material with the considerable help of Clifton Webb. The performances (Vincent Price and Judith Anderson in SUPPORTING roles!?!) mesh together like gears in a Rolex, and it's a pleasure to behold. I know it's been said before, but Gene Tierney's amazing looks make one believe that a detective could fall in love with her portrait. This movie is a superlative exemplar of its genre, and anyone who is a fan of that genre should do themselves a favor and see this film immediately.

    This movie fits on all counts but one! you could have a wild guess who the killer is, while the director tries to provide you with alternative versions to distract you. The movie starts out with the death of a Laura (Gene Tierney), and Detective Mc Pherson (Dana Andrews) trying to investigate the murder. The movie then goes on along McP's collection and rechecking evidence. He tries to soften the suspects by trash talk and trying to read into their reactions. Waldo and Shelby are both in the doubting list and confront McP many times. However, what follows is a classic Noir genre. The twist and the motives are good, effective and worth the 7/10. Looking back at the times when this movie was made, it deserves more than a 7! Hope you enjoy this as much as I have!

    LAURA is a really solid murder mystery with lots of clever dialog most of which are uttered by Clifton Webb's character. Gene Tierney oozes sex even though she is fully clothed all the time. Dana Andrews is tough as nails but his detective character wasn't too well developed. We know he isn't exactly a feminist (When a dame gets killed, she doesn't worry about how she looks.) And him falling in love with Laura was a bit hard to digest. The sinister ending is worth the price of admission. This is a great murder mystery. Obviously some of the characters are there just to make the plot more complicated. (7/10)

    I probably saw this first on TV as early as the 1950's. Have seen it many times since and can probably recite much of the dialog by heart. I agree with most of the positive reviews and I'm glad it has stood the test of time (considering the times in which it was made). I was a young girl so impressed, I named my first daughter, "Laura" -- as much for the beautiful theme as for the character. I also found and read the novel at a used book sale in the late '60s and owned an original copy of the sheet music. I was surprised to find out that this is considered a film noir classic. A film noir with a happy ending? Just the type of old classic movie to thrill a young girl's heart. My impressions then: Laura was a glamorous career woman -- even for the 1950's when I first encountered her, but I enjoyed Gene Tierney's movies, because I could identify with her. Much is said about her socialite and high class background and demure; however, she had an every girl quality too and many educated young women fancied themselves quite sophisticated a la Tierney. Beautiful yes, but there were many actresses even more beautiful. Don't forget the overbite. I most recently saw this movie in the past few years. Clifton Webb is the star of this movie -- a fine actor -- but he had the best lines by far. Vincent Price overacted (as he always did), and Dana Andrews literally sleepwalked (nothing new). Gene Tierney just glowed with star quality as ever. I love when old movies can just suggest what's happened thru dialog and acting, instead of beating you over the head and rubbing your face in it. But I did wonder, this time, what Mark and Laura would have in common or even to talk about once they rolled out of bed. Laura is a perfect movie for its time, but I don't believe it would impress my daughter. It would probably be a yawn.

    Laura was a project, based on a pulpy novel by Vera Caspery, that director Otto Preminger had to fight 20th Century Fox Mogul, Daryl Zanuck, to get made. It was a film that everyone else involved in did not believe in and assumed would be a failure. Yet the film went on to be a huge success and was a source of influence for countless film makers and endures as a classic of the golden era of Hollywood. On the face of it, Laura was in the mode of film noir, with the conventional detective investigating the murder of a glamorous and enthralling woman- as-femme-fatale; the film offers the usual twists in narrative structure and the dubious relationships and men surrounding the central figure, and their obsessions, or neuroses; but visually the film separates itself from the dark shadows and brooding atmosphere of the conventional noir films, and brings an obsessive, illuminating Freudian drama of sexual emasculation and the fundamental flaws of masculine desire. Dana Andrews's investigating detective McPherson, is assigned to the murder case of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), an assured, successful woman, surrounded by seemingly rich and powerful men, who was gunned down in her apartment. As he uncovers information about Laura, helped by a portrait hanging on her living room wall, McPherson, like the men he interviews, becomes obsessed with the woman, as her delightful character, and her determined but innocent-like attractiveness envelops him. Clifton Webb's overtly dandy Waldo, a successful columnist, displays his love of Laura through his detailed recollections of their relationship, whilst the charming yet alarmingly vacant Shelby (Vincent Price), a man having affairs with noticeably more than one woman, is the more darkly sinister of the two, and often (perhaps innocently) implicates himself in the murder. About halfway through the film there is a huge narrative shift, which at first is jarring, as the audience is not sure if this is the fantasy or dream of McPherson, but the revelation shifts the story, questioning the reality of the two main suspects. As McPherson is drawn into the elusive Laura's lifestyle, the central focus of much of the narrative is set in the presence of a painting of Laura hanging in her room. It is an idealisation of the woman - she appears dominating in the picture - an image that is captured not by Laura, but by the men around her. This image is easier to handle that the real thing, it is a passive version of the woman. Whilst a lot is put upon the sexual power that Laura has on these men, it is the neuroses and imbalanced psyches of the men. But Laura, as we discover, is a more individual, independent woman, who perhaps does not require the desire of others. So the fantasised painted version of her can be contained and controlled. A reading could suggest that the power that Laura has over these men somehow perpetuates the incitement to murder, but in fact it would be easier to read that it is the breakdown of the masculine that is the determining factor in murder, and not necessarily a woman who is unsure of her decisions when it comes to settling. The performances are phenomenal here. Andrew's hard-boiled detective is excellent, with his proto-Columbo style of investigation, playing games with the suspects, and forcing them into corners. Price and Webb are brilliantly over-the-top - Price giving a sinister performance through the disguise of charisma. But, inevitably, the titular character, through the mysterious, seductive beauty of Tierney, is awesome in a tricksy way. She is not necessarily the traditional femme fatale, she is not consciously playing these men, yet at times the audience is unsure. Is she twisting the delusions of these men to her will? Or is she as sweet as she sometimes appears? It is an almost perfect performance. The influence of this film is undisputed. The James Elroy novel, The Black Dahlia, whilst loosely based on a true-life crime, was undoubtedly broadened by Laura's influence. The Black Dahlia has the central theme of the obsession by an investigator of a dead woman. These themes of obsession must have been directly correlated by David Lynch and Mark Frost when they wrote and conceived of Twin Peaks which began with the death of a high school girl, and the subsequent investigation unravels levels of obsession in a small community, much of which extended from this one girl. It's a wonderful, twisty, and often surprising story that illustrates that the power of women is not always a product of feminine knowing, but the failures and compulsions of weak, lonely men. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Let me horrify you from my first lines, so you can decide right now if you go on reading this review or you'll just pass: Laura is above all about sexual repression in the social upper crust in the 40s. Truth is, I've never seen a flick where it appears so evident that none of the main characters are doing it; or that they are doing it in a enjoyable way. Even worse, they are sublimating their libidosthat one I learned it in Secondary III, in Psychology class--falling in love, or fantasizing, about unreachable ones. If you don't believe it, just mention me a single occasion here where, as the saying goes, two sets of eyes find each other across a crowded room; when a man looks at a woman with lust in his eyes; when two hands rub each other by accident, trying to reach an astray for ex., and faces go red, hands tremble. Nope, there's absolutely no sexual tension in any scene here, no hint that any of these people have normal sexual lives. All you hear in its 87 min. is talk, talk, talk--which is the easiest way of getting rid of the excess libido. But, you'll argue, the same can be said of many flicks; like say, Guns of Navarone. That's true--but people there had good reasons as they were using their libidos to try to win a war. The difference in Laura is, all here are blatantly showcasing their needs, while at the same time trying by all means to have a substitute which would allow them the release without having to go through the experience itself. At its core, Laura is a scathing portrait of how unfulfilling the sex life of this crowd was at that epoch, despite all the ritzy appearances. Here the main focus of sublimated lust of every Joe is Laura herself, the incredibly beautiful yet sexually neutral, anodyne goddess to fantasize about but who'll turn into ashes--or stone?-as soon as you touch her.(this is not meant to be a criticism of Tierney, truly, but if she was such a hot ticket then is because her aseptic beauty fitted best the tastes and conventions of those puritanical, pre--Marilyn times in Hollywood). And of course women will fantasize about men they can't have. At the end the only real crime committed here is having them all licking their chops while not getting any. (BTW, in the original script Laura really died, which means McPherson fell in love with her portrait, following the norm). Now, about the technical aspect, the package, the cinematography, I'm not the first one to say it: Laura is all about style, about beautiful people in beautiful clothes parading in elegant surroundings, drinking champagne and carrying on their beautiful conversations. Speaking of which, I've never seen a flick with more contrived, unnatural, lines of dialog. I was checking all along and I could barely find any case in which a character was taken off guard by someone else's remark and had to pause, think, before giving an answer. It was just like a tennis match, snappy lines coming and going, as if the characters were all reading their lines which of course reveals the artificiality of the whole thing. As for Waldo I can't believe his insulting invectives could pass for witticism at any time, context, social milieu. Are they sure they consulted the right entry in Webster's? And man, does he sound like something is wrong with him. If someone came nowadays talking like that to a hotel desk they would make him lie down, give him some air and call a doctor. Where do they talk like that, in Mensa meetings, in the Save the Platypus organization?. And frankly I don't see this one as a noir. Rather as a flick that purposely started trying to be a noir only to lose its way going there and becoming entangled in a mess of assorted things: drama de moeurs (as the French say), faux--romance, crime thriller, social commentary. The only linking element being, as said, that the characters are not getting any. Noir characters need a least some depth, some dramatic reach, and these here are unbelievable in their shallowness and artificiality, more cardboard cuts than real people. Neither there's any atmosphere, no ambiance, no feel of impending doom. I didn't even feel for Laura when she was "arrested", as at that point I wasn't even looking at her as a real person, just as an image on a screen. Despite it all Laura is half-heartedly recommended, if only to know what the fuss is about. As a plus you have the typical Preminger direction, with his meticulous setting & framing of sceneswith his proverbial economy of shots, as we know--with his expert use of full bodied blacks along with resplendent whites. Most of the action unfolds in interiors, giving him the chance for indulging in luxurious surroundings--gorgeous sculptures, Ming vases, invaluable paintingsto the point that Laura's apartment looks like the ballroom of the Titanic. Or that was Waldo's bathroom...In any case, don't look for emotion, for sexual tension or for depth here. There's no one single relationship having any of that; they all look contrived, specially that of the leads. Just picture it: Laura sees as proof of the cop's love the fact that he arrests her for murder, so he can show her his feelings "in an more official setting". If that doesn't turn you away, then give it a try. 6.0/10.

    This is definitely one of the finest crime thrillers of its times. Otto Preminger was able to direct a movie that is gripping and very mysterious because of the storyline, and at the same time tremendously dialogue-oriented, because of its structure. He gave this noir movie a fine European touch, mainly due to the fact that there aren't any spectacular gun fights, chases or on-screen murders, but the emphasis is put on dialogues, which encourage one's imagination to produce vivid images of the crime. It's a tale of brutal murder, and huge obsession that lead to it. However, the unexpected turn, placed brilliantly somewhere in the middle of the movie, makes it even more suspenseful. The film makes a great use of various flashbacks to show the roots of this enormous obsession and jealousy coming from the side of Waldo Lydecker. Fine narrative voice-over that is somehow very similar to the one used later in Sunset Boulevard. It is supposed to set the mood and impose an intrigue that will satisfy the viewer and make him concentrated on every detail of the story. You can see the director's professionalism in every aspect of the film. For one, he makes a fascinating use of symbolism, and various elements that come with it (namely the two clocks), which ultimately lead to an important discovery, providing the horrifying explanation of this tough case. Dana Andrews is fantastic as a detective, who is serious about his job, but at the same time inescapably falls in love with the girl, whose murder he is investigating. He wants to show how tough and unemotional he can be when it comes to his line of work, but after some time the only thing he cares about is Laura and her safety. Talking about the titular girl: Gene Tierney is really appealing and convincing as pure, seemingly innocent and very amiable Laura. Her mesmerizing beauty makes it very easy to believe that every man falls in love with her right away and wants to have her only to himself. Clifton Webb is great as this really clever and wise writer, who with a little help of his huge intelligence and cunningness is able to convince everyone that he should be the least suspected person in the whole case. All in all, Laura is a very fine thriller with a properly developed plot and well-selected cast of characters. Everyone can be a suspect, just like in all the decent detective tale that you will find. But the somber atmosphere surrounding the story and incredible jealousy and obsessive behavior depicted in it provide for a noir title that everybody should see at least once.

    Laura Hunt is a young, beautiful, hugely successful New York advertising executive. Or rather she was those things. Because as this movie opens Laura is dead. Murdered, a shotgun blast to the face. So who was Laura really? What do we really know about her? Those are intriguing questions. But this movie's big question is of course who killed her? The mystery unfolds with a small handful of suspects and an at times rather peculiar investigation. Along the way we have some flashbacks to help establish who Laura was, how our suspects were connected to her, and why anyone could have possibly wanted to blow this seemingly innocent woman's head off. Because on the surface her murder makes very little sense. As you try to make some sense of it all the movie has some big surprises in store for you. Dana Andrews plays the role of detective Mark McPherson, who in the course of his investigation does some rather unusual things. Things which quite frankly no detective would ever actually do. But we will see he must do these things to move the movie's plot forward. Without this series of contrivances there would be no movie. Rather sloppy plotting it must be said but not so bad as to greatly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. One of McPherson's absurd actions is to allow one of his prime suspects to tag along for interrogations of his other prime suspects. A very contrived way to get all the key players in a room together. That prime suspect is newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker, the man responsible for making Laura who she was. Just ask him, he'll tell you. He loves talking about himself that's for sure. Clifton Webb plays this flamboyant, rather effeminate character. Waldo prances through the movie like a queen but it is apparent that he was quite in love with Laura. Which makes the fact that Laura was about to marry another man quite unacceptable in Waldo's eyes. The man Laura intended to marry is Shelby Carpenter, a not particularly intelligent country bumpkin who somehow finds himself moving in Manhattan's highest social circles. But did Laura really intend to marry Shelby? Waldo would have you believe she was reconsidering the marriage. If Shelby knew that he might certainly have a motive for the murder. Meanwhile Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell, has a thing for Shelby so maybe she wanted Laura out of the way. And Laura's maid also seemed to have an unusually strong affection for Laura. So there are the suspects. The movie then goes through a series of twists and turns, one of which is a real doozy, before all will finally be revealed. This is an intriguing movie but perhaps not quite as engrossing as it may have been. Even at less than ninety minutes the movie seems a bit slow and labored at times. The fact that some of the key story elements are scarcely believable doesn't help. Andrews does an OK job in playing the movie's detective but the fact that detective does so many frankly stupid things sometimes makes it hard to take the guy seriously. Webb floats through the movie on a cloud, chewing as much scenery as he can swallow. But his performance does make for a memorable character. The problem is that when you see Webb's 50-something Waldo with Gene Tierney's beautiful 20-something Laura the love story doesn't ring true. The oddest of odd couples. Then again while Laura had affection for Waldo she was after all intending to marry another man. So it's apparently unrequited love on Waldo's part. That other man, Shelby, is played by Vincent Price. It's not always easy playing a hapless dunce and that's pretty much what Shelby is. But Price does very well in the role. As the aunt and the maid Judith Anderson and Dorothy Adams respectively have less to do. They're pushed forward as possible suspects but the movie focuses most of its attention on Waldo and Shelby. Laura herself gets a little lost but Tierney certainly holds her own when she gets her opportunities. This is a movie which wants to keep you guessing but it doesn't always succeed in that. It certainly surprises you here and there but by the end there's a creeping sense of inevitability. Most in the audience will probably guess the murderer's identity before the movie's detective does. When we get to that ending we find it's just as contrived as much of what has preceded it. Instead of going out with a bang the movie fizzles out in what is slightly disappointing fashion. This isn't a bad murder mystery but it would be hard to call it a truly great one. It has its intriguing elements but the whole ends up being a little less than the sum of its parts.

    Provocative Mystery and Stylish Glamour; Glorious Portrait and Haunting Score

    A portrait, a painting, a piece of art have always played a decisive role in addressing our emotions and leading our thoughts to some 'idealized reality.' A beautiful woman in the painting has been a focus of interest...men admired her, women envied her; yet both have been affected by her glamor, mystery, detail and style. "A passion for the unavailable," as Petrarch once described the name Laura, is precisely what we encounter in this powerful film noir of the 1940s where one of the most beautiful actresses, Gene Tierney, at last decided to "play a painting." But is it only the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who makes this film one of the most aesthetic and fabulous screen productions? Is the widespread appreciation and applause dedicated only to her? All the merits of the film appear to focus on PORTRAIT, SCORE and ATMOSPHERE. These three aspects, as certain details, seem to create the harmony of the general conclusion after viewing LAURA. As a film noir (one of its very best manifestations), LAURA emphasizes the portrait of "a woman of mystery and glamor" (Gene Tierney)...an advertising executive whom we get to know with New York police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews). Just for curiosity, the portrait was initially painted by director Rouben Mamoulian's wife (first director of the movie) but...as a matter of fact, what we actually find in the movie is a blowup of Gene Tierney's photograph. The portrait leads us to the specific atmosphere of tension, suspicion, glamor, haunt, mystery and the unpredictable effects of murder investigation...the atmosphere at its best! This atmosphere is enriched by magnificent score, a unique work by David Raksin, a novelty at that time promoted by the composer for Fox studio Alfred Newman. His score supplies us with unforgettable feelings while watching the movie and helps the viewers keep interest and suspicion. It beautifully adapts detective elements, sexual references and a sentiment to the scenes. To enrich the atmosphere, we also need to add the flashbacks that play an important role in the movie and explain a lot in discovering the events as well as lead us to a certain reality and emotions. Also, the moody scenes with stunning cinematography add certain moods and resemblance. Another significant aspect of LAURA's artistry are, of course, the performances. Although there are practically not many characters in the movie, casting occurred to be pretty challenging. It is important to keep in mind that the author of the novel, Vera Caspary, badly wanted a screen adaptation but had her word in many decisions, including the portrayals of characters. After the long and tedious process of casting (even Marlene Dietrich was willing to play the lead), the results are fabulous. Gene Tierney portrays a sophisticated woman of the high society, no naive woman, no femme fatale but a strong woman who gets balanced among three men our attention is called upon: the newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) whose vicious charm shapes her decisions and who has, indeed, the strongest power in her life; her fianc&eacute; Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a gentle man who "would not even kill a fly" and the police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) who suspects no one and everyone at the same time. In between the men comes her wealthy aunt, Ann Treadwell memorably portrayed by the highly respected actress whose career illumined both the stage and cinema, Judith Anderson. However, let me consider the male performances in more details. Dana Andrews does a brilliant job as the detective making us not only the observers of the investigation but, thanks to the powerful and effective depiction of indefatigable determination, he lets us into his world where women are 'dames' and where suspicions are daily bread. The most unforgettable scene is when he enters Laura's apartment and the emphasis on details, the dream-like tension and his instantaneous movements occur to be the clarity with no words. Clifton Webb, who portrays the most difficult character, in fact, excellently combines the wretchedness with sympathy, doubt with certainty. He is not a villain and he does not look to be one... He is a man of power, a man of talent, a man of self esteem and mannerisms. He even becomes respectable, even in the eyes of the most suspicious viewers until... Vincent Price has his moments in the film, he is vibrant and genuine in the role; a young and inexperienced in man-woman relation? A little but shy? It occurs quite meaningful to state that both Clifton Webb and Vincent Price started their careers from supporting roles and then became legendary. However, there is yet another legendary name in LAURA that makes this film stand out as a historic production...that is the "tireless" (according to Gene Tierney) director Otto Preminger. Vincent Price memorably stated: "Otto Preminger had an implicit knowledge of pseudo-sophisticated world" and supplied the characters with the 'sense of evil' not making anyone villains. Preminger's great achievement is the fact that he managed to combine a detective story with psychology. His direction makes the film both sophisticated and romantic...I don't doubt that Rouben Mamoulian with his exquisite talents would also have managed that stylish element (he proved that in DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE)...yet, some of his requirements occurred to be of little use for the crew and the author herself. LAURA is a great atmospheric film noir, a provocative mystery combined with the stylish glamor where the haunting score leads us to the glorious portrait of female charm and mystery. 9/10

    Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been murdered, and as New York City Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigates, he finds that everyone seems to be in love with her -- and he, too, gradually falls under her spell. But things aren't always what they seem. Darryl F. Zanuck was opposed to casting Clifton Webb because of his known homosexuality, but Preminger prevailed and the 54-year-old Webb, making his first screen appearance since the silent era, was nominated for an Oscar. Webb really does sell the film, with lines like, "Will you stop calling her a dame? Does this look like the home of a dame? Have you ever known a woman who wasn't a doll or a dame?" Great dignified actor. And speaking of dignified, you have Vincent Price, young and without any facial hair, even before his voice achieved its full distinctiveness. Interestingly, he comes off as a wimp here and seems to go back and forth between stage and screen style acting. (Price always had a very stage quality to his film roles.) Does this film have a connection to "Twin Peaks"? A girl named Laura, murdered, with everyone attracted to her? I do not know... there is no direct connection, but it came to my mind.

    This movie reminds me of Casablanca in that it SHOULD have been just a run-of-the- mill noirish potboiler, but it ends up being so much more than that, thanks to a happy confluence of talents. Just as Bogart and Bergman, with the help of Claude Rains, raise Casablanca to sublimity, so too do Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney raise this material with the considerable help of Clifton Webb. The performances (Vincent Price and Judith Anderson in SUPPORTING roles!?!) mesh together like gears in a Rolex, and it's a pleasure to behold. I know it's been said before, but Gene Tierney's amazing looks make one believe that a detective could fall in love with her portrait. This movie is a superlative exemplar of its genre, and anyone who is a fan of that genre should do themselves a favor and see this film immediately.

    This movie fits on all counts but one! you could have a wild guess who the killer is, while the director tries to provide you with alternative versions to distract you. The movie starts out with the death of a Laura (Gene Tierney), and Detective Mc Pherson (Dana Andrews) trying to investigate the murder. The movie then goes on along McP's collection and rechecking evidence. He tries to soften the suspects by trash talk and trying to read into their reactions. Waldo and Shelby are both in the doubting list and confront McP many times. However, what follows is a classic Noir genre. The twist and the motives are good, effective and worth the 7/10. Looking back at the times when this movie was made, it deserves more than a 7! Hope you enjoy this as much as I have!

    LAURA is a really solid murder mystery with lots of clever dialog most of which are uttered by Clifton Webb's character. Gene Tierney oozes sex even though she is fully clothed all the time. Dana Andrews is tough as nails but his detective character wasn't too well developed. We know he isn't exactly a feminist (When a dame gets killed, she doesn't worry about how she looks.) And him falling in love with Laura was a bit hard to digest. The sinister ending is worth the price of admission. This is a great murder mystery. Obviously some of the characters are there just to make the plot more complicated. (7/10)

    I probably saw this first on TV as early as the 1950's. Have seen it many times since and can probably recite much of the dialog by heart. I agree with most of the positive reviews and I'm glad it has stood the test of time (considering the times in which it was made). I was a young girl so impressed, I named my first daughter, "Laura" -- as much for the beautiful theme as for the character. I also found and read the novel at a used book sale in the late '60s and owned an original copy of the sheet music. I was surprised to find out that this is considered a film noir classic. A film noir with a happy ending? Just the type of old classic movie to thrill a young girl's heart. My impressions then: Laura was a glamorous career woman -- even for the 1950's when I first encountered her, but I enjoyed Gene Tierney's movies, because I could identify with her. Much is said about her socialite and high class background and demure; however, she had an every girl quality too and many educated young women fancied themselves quite sophisticated a la Tierney. Beautiful yes, but there were many actresses even more beautiful. Don't forget the overbite. I most recently saw this movie in the past few years. Clifton Webb is the star of this movie -- a fine actor -- but he had the best lines by far. Vincent Price overacted (as he always did), and Dana Andrews literally sleepwalked (nothing new). Gene Tierney just glowed with star quality as ever. I love when old movies can just suggest what's happened thru dialog and acting, instead of beating you over the head and rubbing your face in it. But I did wonder, this time, what Mark and Laura would have in common or even to talk about once they rolled out of bed. Laura is a perfect movie for its time, but I don't believe it would impress my daughter. It would probably be a yawn.

    Laura was a project, based on a pulpy novel by Vera Caspery, that director Otto Preminger had to fight 20th Century Fox Mogul, Daryl Zanuck, to get made. It was a film that everyone else involved in did not believe in and assumed would be a failure. Yet the film went on to be a huge success and was a source of influence for countless film makers and endures as a classic of the golden era of Hollywood. On the face of it, Laura was in the mode of film noir, with the conventional detective investigating the murder of a glamorous and enthralling woman- as-femme-fatale; the film offers the usual twists in narrative structure and the dubious relationships and men surrounding the central figure, and their obsessions, or neuroses; but visually the film separates itself from the dark shadows and brooding atmosphere of the conventional noir films, and brings an obsessive, illuminating Freudian drama of sexual emasculation and the fundamental flaws of masculine desire. Dana Andrews's investigating detective McPherson, is assigned to the murder case of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), an assured, successful woman, surrounded by seemingly rich and powerful men, who was gunned down in her apartment. As he uncovers information about Laura, helped by a portrait hanging on her living room wall, McPherson, like the men he interviews, becomes obsessed with the woman, as her delightful character, and her determined but innocent-like attractiveness envelops him. Clifton Webb's overtly dandy Waldo, a successful columnist, displays his love of Laura through his detailed recollections of their relationship, whilst the charming yet alarmingly vacant Shelby (Vincent Price), a man having affairs with noticeably more than one woman, is the more darkly sinister of the two, and often (perhaps innocently) implicates himself in the murder. About halfway through the film there is a huge narrative shift, which at first is jarring, as the audience is not sure if this is the fantasy or dream of McPherson, but the revelation shifts the story, questioning the reality of the two main suspects. As McPherson is drawn into the elusive Laura's lifestyle, the central focus of much of the narrative is set in the presence of a painting of Laura hanging in her room. It is an idealisation of the woman - she appears dominating in the picture - an image that is captured not by Laura, but by the men around her. This image is easier to handle that the real thing, it is a passive version of the woman. Whilst a lot is put upon the sexual power that Laura has on these men, it is the neuroses and imbalanced psyches of the men. But Laura, as we discover, is a more individual, independent woman, who perhaps does not require the desire of others. So the fantasised painted version of her can be contained and controlled. A reading could suggest that the power that Laura has over these men somehow perpetuates the incitement to murder, but in fact it would be easier to read that it is the breakdown of the masculine that is the determining factor in murder, and not necessarily a woman who is unsure of her decisions when it comes to settling. The performances are phenomenal here. Andrew's hard-boiled detective is excellent, with his proto-Columbo style of investigation, playing games with the suspects, and forcing them into corners. Price and Webb are brilliantly over-the-top - Price giving a sinister performance through the disguise of charisma. But, inevitably, the titular character, through the mysterious, seductive beauty of Tierney, is awesome in a tricksy way. She is not necessarily the traditional femme fatale, she is not consciously playing these men, yet at times the audience is unsure. Is she twisting the delusions of these men to her will? Or is she as sweet as she sometimes appears? It is an almost perfect performance. The influence of this film is undisputed. The James Elroy novel, The Black Dahlia, whilst loosely based on a true-life crime, was undoubtedly broadened by Laura's influence. The Black Dahlia has the central theme of the obsession by an investigator of a dead woman. These themes of obsession must have been directly correlated by David Lynch and Mark Frost when they wrote and conceived of Twin Peaks which began with the death of a high school girl, and the subsequent investigation unravels levels of obsession in a small community, much of which extended from this one girl. It's a wonderful, twisty, and often surprising story that illustrates that the power of women is not always a product of feminine knowing, but the failures and compulsions of weak, lonely men. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Let me horrify you from my first lines, so you can decide right now if you go on reading this review or you'll just pass: Laura is above all about sexual repression in the social upper crust in the 40s. Truth is, I've never seen a flick where it appears so evident that none of the main characters are doing it; or that they are doing it in a enjoyable way. Even worse, they are sublimating their libidosthat one I learned it in Secondary III, in Psychology class--falling in love, or fantasizing, about unreachable ones. If you don't believe it, just mention me a single occasion here where, as the saying goes, two sets of eyes find each other across a crowded room; when a man looks at a woman with lust in his eyes; when two hands rub each other by accident, trying to reach an astray for ex., and faces go red, hands tremble. Nope, there's absolutely no sexual tension in any scene here, no hint that any of these people have normal sexual lives. All you hear in its 87 min. is talk, talk, talk--which is the easiest way of getting rid of the excess libido. But, you'll argue, the same can be said of many flicks; like say, Guns of Navarone. That's true--but people there had good reasons as they were using their libidos to try to win a war. The difference in Laura is, all here are blatantly showcasing their needs, while at the same time trying by all means to have a substitute which would allow them the release without having to go through the experience itself. At its core, Laura is a scathing portrait of how unfulfilling the sex life of this crowd was at that epoch, despite all the ritzy appearances. Here the main focus of sublimated lust of every Joe is Laura herself, the incredibly beautiful yet sexually neutral, anodyne goddess to fantasize about but who'll turn into ashes--or stone?-as soon as you touch her.(this is not meant to be a criticism of Tierney, truly, but if she was such a hot ticket then is because her aseptic beauty fitted best the tastes and conventions of those puritanical, pre--Marilyn times in Hollywood). And of course women will fantasize about men they can't have. At the end the only real crime committed here is having them all licking their chops while not getting any. (BTW, in the original script Laura really died, which means McPherson fell in love with her portrait, following the norm). Now, about the technical aspect, the package, the cinematography, I'm not the first one to say it: Laura is all about style, about beautiful people in beautiful clothes parading in elegant surroundings, drinking champagne and carrying on their beautiful conversations. Speaking of which, I've never seen a flick with more contrived, unnatural, lines of dialog. I was checking all along and I could barely find any case in which a character was taken off guard by someone else's remark and had to pause, think, before giving an answer. It was just like a tennis match, snappy lines coming and going, as if the characters were all reading their lines which of course reveals the artificiality of the whole thing. As for Waldo I can't believe his insulting invectives could pass for witticism at any time, context, social milieu. Are they sure they consulted the right entry in Webster's? And man, does he sound like something is wrong with him. If someone came nowadays talking like that to a hotel desk they would make him lie down, give him some air and call a doctor. Where do they talk like that, in Mensa meetings, in the Save the Platypus organization?. And frankly I don't see this one as a noir. Rather as a flick that purposely started trying to be a noir only to lose its way going there and becoming entangled in a mess of assorted things: drama de moeurs (as the French say), faux--romance, crime thriller, social commentary. The only linking element being, as said, that the characters are not getting any. Noir characters need a least some depth, some dramatic reach, and these here are unbelievable in their shallowness and artificiality, more cardboard cuts than real people. Neither there's any atmosphere, no ambiance, no feel of impending doom. I didn't even feel for Laura when she was "arrested", as at that point I wasn't even looking at her as a real person, just as an image on a screen. Despite it all Laura is half-heartedly recommended, if only to know what the fuss is about. As a plus you have the typical Preminger direction, with his meticulous setting & framing of sceneswith his proverbial economy of shots, as we know--with his expert use of full bodied blacks along with resplendent whites. Most of the action unfolds in interiors, giving him the chance for indulging in luxurious surroundings--gorgeous sculptures, Ming vases, invaluable paintingsto the point that Laura's apartment looks like the ballroom of the Titanic. Or that was Waldo's bathroom...In any case, don't look for emotion, for sexual tension or for depth here. There's no one single relationship having any of that; they all look contrived, specially that of the leads. Just picture it: Laura sees as proof of the cop's love the fact that he arrests her for murder, so he can show her his feelings "in an more official setting". If that doesn't turn you away, then give it a try. 6.0/10.

    This is definitely one of the finest crime thrillers of its times. Otto Preminger was able to direct a movie that is gripping and very mysterious because of the storyline, and at the same time tremendously dialogue-oriented, because of its structure. He gave this noir movie a fine European touch, mainly due to the fact that there aren't any spectacular gun fights, chases or on-screen murders, but the emphasis is put on dialogues, which encourage one's imagination to produce vivid images of the crime. It's a tale of brutal murder, and huge obsession that lead to it. However, the unexpected turn, placed brilliantly somewhere in the middle of the movie, makes it even more suspenseful. The film makes a great use of various flashbacks to show the roots of this enormous obsession and jealousy coming from the side of Waldo Lydecker. Fine narrative voice-over that is somehow very similar to the one used later in Sunset Boulevard. It is supposed to set the mood and impose an intrigue that will satisfy the viewer and make him concentrated on every detail of the story. You can see the director's professionalism in every aspect of the film. For one, he makes a fascinating use of symbolism, and various elements that come with it (namely the two clocks), which ultimately lead to an important discovery, providing the horrifying explanation of this tough case. Dana Andrews is fantastic as a detective, who is serious about his job, but at the same time inescapably falls in love with the girl, whose murder he is investigating. He wants to show how tough and unemotional he can be when it comes to his line of work, but after some time the only thing he cares about is Laura and her safety. Talking about the titular girl: Gene Tierney is really appealing and convincing as pure, seemingly innocent and very amiable Laura. Her mesmerizing beauty makes it very easy to believe that every man falls in love with her right away and wants to have her only to himself. Clifton Webb is great as this really clever and wise writer, who with a little help of his huge intelligence and cunningness is able to convince everyone that he should be the least suspected person in the whole case. All in all, Laura is a very fine thriller with a properly developed plot and well-selected cast of characters. Everyone can be a suspect, just like in all the decent detective tale that you will find. But the somber atmosphere surrounding the story and incredible jealousy and obsessive behavior depicted in it provide for a noir title that everybody should see at least once.

    Laura Hunt is a young, beautiful, hugely successful New York advertising executive. Or rather she was those things. Because as this movie opens Laura is dead. Murdered, a shotgun blast to the face. So who was Laura really? What do we really know about her? Those are intriguing questions. But this movie's big question is of course who killed her? The mystery unfolds with a small handful of suspects and an at times rather peculiar investigation. Along the way we have some flashbacks to help establish who Laura was, how our suspects were connected to her, and why anyone could have possibly wanted to blow this seemingly innocent woman's head off. Because on the surface her murder makes very little sense. As you try to make some sense of it all the movie has some big surprises in store for you. Dana Andrews plays the role of detective Mark McPherson, who in the course of his investigation does some rather unusual things. Things which quite frankly no detective would ever actually do. But we will see he must do these things to move the movie's plot forward. Without this series of contrivances there would be no movie. Rather sloppy plotting it must be said but not so bad as to greatly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. One of McPherson's absurd actions is to allow one of his prime suspects to tag along for interrogations of his other prime suspects. A very contrived way to get all the key players in a room together. That prime suspect is newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker, the man responsible for making Laura who she was. Just ask him, he'll tell you. He loves talking about himself that's for sure. Clifton Webb plays this flamboyant, rather effeminate character. Waldo prances through the movie like a queen but it is apparent that he was quite in love with Laura. Which makes the fact that Laura was about to marry another man quite unacceptable in Waldo's eyes. The man Laura intended to marry is Shelby Carpenter, a not particularly intelligent country bumpkin who somehow finds himself moving in Manhattan's highest social circles. But did Laura really intend to marry Shelby? Waldo would have you believe she was reconsidering the marriage. If Shelby knew that he might certainly have a motive for the murder. Meanwhile Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell, has a thing for Shelby so maybe she wanted Laura out of the way. And Laura's maid also seemed to have an unusually strong affection for Laura. So there are the suspects. The movie then goes through a series of twists and turns, one of which is a real doozy, before all will finally be revealed. This is an intriguing movie but perhaps not quite as engrossing as it may have been. Even at less than ninety minutes the movie seems a bit slow and labored at times. The fact that some of the key story elements are scarcely believable doesn't help. Andrews does an OK job in playing the movie's detective but the fact that detective does so many frankly stupid things sometimes makes it hard to take the guy seriously. Webb floats through the movie on a cloud, chewing as much scenery as he can swallow. But his performance does make for a memorable character. The problem is that when you see Webb's 50-something Waldo with Gene Tierney's beautiful 20-something Laura the love story doesn't ring true. The oddest of odd couples. Then again while Laura had affection for Waldo she was after all intending to marry another man. So it's apparently unrequited love on Waldo's part. That other man, Shelby, is played by Vincent Price. It's not always easy playing a hapless dunce and that's pretty much what Shelby is. But Price does very well in the role. As the aunt and the maid Judith Anderson and Dorothy Adams respectively have less to do. They're pushed forward as possible suspects but the movie focuses most of its attention on Waldo and Shelby. Laura herself gets a little lost but Tierney certainly holds her own when she gets her opportunities. This is a movie which wants to keep you guessing but it doesn't always succeed in that. It certainly surprises you here and there but by the end there's a creeping sense of inevitability. Most in the audience will probably guess the murderer's identity before the movie's detective does. When we get to that ending we find it's just as contrived as much of what has preceded it. Instead of going out with a bang the movie fizzles out in what is slightly disappointing fashion. This isn't a bad murder mystery but it would be hard to call it a truly great one. It has its intriguing elements but the whole ends up being a little less than the sum of its parts.

    Provocative Mystery and Stylish Glamour; Glorious Portrait and Haunting Score

    A portrait, a painting, a piece of art have always played a decisive role in addressing our emotions and leading our thoughts to some 'idealized reality.' A beautiful woman in the painting has been a focus of interest...men admired her, women envied her; yet both have been affected by her glamor, mystery, detail and style. "A passion for the unavailable," as Petrarch once described the name Laura, is precisely what we encounter in this powerful film noir of the 1940s where one of the most beautiful actresses, Gene Tierney, at last decided to "play a painting." But is it only the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who makes this film one of the most aesthetic and fabulous screen productions? Is the widespread appreciation and applause dedicated only to her? All the merits of the film appear to focus on PORTRAIT, SCORE and ATMOSPHERE. These three aspects, as certain details, seem to create the harmony of the general conclusion after viewing LAURA. As a film noir (one of its very best manifestations), LAURA emphasizes the portrait of "a woman of mystery and glamor" (Gene Tierney)...an advertising executive whom we get to know with New York police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews). Just for curiosity, the portrait was initially painted by director Rouben Mamoulian's wife (first director of the movie) but...as a matter of fact, what we actually find in the movie is a blowup of Gene Tierney's photograph. The portrait leads us to the specific atmosphere of tension, suspicion, glamor, haunt, mystery and the unpredictable effects of murder investigation...the atmosphere at its best! This atmosphere is enriched by magnificent score, a unique work by David Raksin, a novelty at that time promoted by the composer for Fox studio Alfred Newman. His score supplies us with unforgettable feelings while watching the movie and helps the viewers keep interest and suspicion. It beautifully adapts detective elements, sexual references and a sentiment to the scenes. To enrich the atmosphere, we also need to add the flashbacks that play an important role in the movie and explain a lot in discovering the events as well as lead us to a certain reality and emotions. Also, the moody scenes with stunning cinematography add certain moods and resemblance. Another significant aspect of LAURA's artistry are, of course, the performances. Although there are practically not many characters in the movie, casting occurred to be pretty challenging. It is important to keep in mind that the author of the novel, Vera Caspary, badly wanted a screen adaptation but had her word in many decisions, including the portrayals of characters. After the long and tedious process of casting (even Marlene Dietrich was willing to play the lead), the results are fabulous. Gene Tierney portrays a sophisticated woman of the high society, no naive woman, no femme fatale but a strong woman who gets balanced among three men our attention is called upon: the newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) whose vicious charm shapes her decisions and who has, indeed, the strongest power in her life; her fianc&eacute; Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a gentle man who "would not even kill a fly" and the police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) who suspects no one and everyone at the same time. In between the men comes her wealthy aunt, Ann Treadwell memorably portrayed by the highly respected actress whose career illumined both the stage and cinema, Judith Anderson. However, let me consider the male performances in more details. Dana Andrews does a brilliant job as the detective making us not only the observers of the investigation but, thanks to the powerful and effective depiction of indefatigable determination, he lets us into his world where women are 'dames' and where suspicions are daily bread. The most unforgettable scene is when he enters Laura's apartment and the emphasis on details, the dream-like tension and his instantaneous movements occur to be the clarity with no words. Clifton Webb, who portrays the most difficult character, in fact, excellently combines the wretchedness with sympathy, doubt with certainty. He is not a villain and he does not look to be one... He is a man of power, a man of talent, a man of self esteem and mannerisms. He even becomes respectable, even in the eyes of the most suspicious viewers until... Vincent Price has his moments in the film, he is vibrant and genuine in the role; a young and inexperienced in man-woman relation? A little but shy? It occurs quite meaningful to state that both Clifton Webb and Vincent Price started their careers from supporting roles and then became legendary. However, there is yet another legendary name in LAURA that makes this film stand out as a historic production...that is the "tireless" (according to Gene Tierney) director Otto Preminger. Vincent Price memorably stated: "Otto Preminger had an implicit knowledge of pseudo-sophisticated world" and supplied the characters with the 'sense of evil' not making anyone villains. Preminger's great achievement is the fact that he managed to combine a detective story with psychology. His direction makes the film both sophisticated and romantic...I don't doubt that Rouben Mamoulian with his exquisite talents would also have managed that stylish element (he proved that in DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE)...yet, some of his requirements occurred to be of little use for the crew and the author herself. LAURA is a great atmospheric film noir, a provocative mystery combined with the stylish glamor where the haunting score leads us to the glorious portrait of female charm and mystery. 9/10

    Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been murdered, and as New York City Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigates, he finds that everyone seems to be in love with her -- and he, too, gradually falls under her spell. But things aren't always what they seem. Darryl F. Zanuck was opposed to casting Clifton Webb because of his known homosexuality, but Preminger prevailed and the 54-year-old Webb, making his first screen appearance since the silent era, was nominated for an Oscar. Webb really does sell the film, with lines like, "Will you stop calling her a dame? Does this look like the home of a dame? Have you ever known a woman who wasn't a doll or a dame?" Great dignified actor. And speaking of dignified, you have Vincent Price, young and without any facial hair, even before his voice achieved its full distinctiveness. Interestingly, he comes off as a wimp here and seems to go back and forth between stage and screen style acting. (Price always had a very stage quality to his film roles.) Does this film have a connection to "Twin Peaks"? A girl named Laura, murdered, with everyone attracted to her? I do not know... there is no direct connection, but it came to my mind.

    This movie reminds me of Casablanca in that it SHOULD have been just a run-of-the- mill noirish potboiler, but it ends up being so much more than that, thanks to a happy confluence of talents. Just as Bogart and Bergman, with the help of Claude Rains, raise Casablanca to sublimity, so too do Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney raise this material with the considerable help of Clifton Webb. The performances (Vincent Price and Judith Anderson in SUPPORTING roles!?!) mesh together like gears in a Rolex, and it's a pleasure to behold. I know it's been said before, but Gene Tierney's amazing looks make one believe that a detective could fall in love with her portrait. This movie is a superlative exemplar of its genre, and anyone who is a fan of that genre should do themselves a favor and see this film immediately.

    This movie fits on all counts but one! you could have a wild guess who the killer is, while the director tries to provide you with alternative versions to distract you. The movie starts out with the death of a Laura (Gene Tierney), and Detective Mc Pherson (Dana Andrews) trying to investigate the murder. The movie then goes on along McP's collection and rechecking evidence. He tries to soften the suspects by trash talk and trying to read into their reactions. Waldo and Shelby are both in the doubting list and confront McP many times. However, what follows is a classic Noir genre. The twist and the motives are good, effective and worth the 7/10. Looking back at the times when this movie was made, it deserves more than a 7! Hope you enjoy this as much as I have!

    LAURA is a really solid murder mystery with lots of clever dialog most of which are uttered by Clifton Webb's character. Gene Tierney oozes sex even though she is fully clothed all the time. Dana Andrews is tough as nails but his detective character wasn't too well developed. We know he isn't exactly a feminist (When a dame gets killed, she doesn't worry about how she looks.) And him falling in love with Laura was a bit hard to digest. The sinister ending is worth the price of admission. This is a great murder mystery. Obviously some of the characters are there just to make the plot more complicated. (7/10)

    I probably saw this first on TV as early as the 1950's. Have seen it many times since and can probably recite much of the dialog by heart. I agree with most of the positive reviews and I'm glad it has stood the test of time (considering the times in which it was made). I was a young girl so impressed, I named my first daughter, "Laura" -- as much for the beautiful theme as for the character. I also found and read the novel at a used book sale in the late '60s and owned an original copy of the sheet music. I was surprised to find out that this is considered a film noir classic. A film noir with a happy ending? Just the type of old classic movie to thrill a young girl's heart. My impressions then: Laura was a glamorous career woman -- even for the 1950's when I first encountered her, but I enjoyed Gene Tierney's movies, because I could identify with her. Much is said about her socialite and high class background and demure; however, she had an every girl quality too and many educated young women fancied themselves quite sophisticated a la Tierney. Beautiful yes, but there were many actresses even more beautiful. Don't forget the overbite. I most recently saw this movie in the past few years. Clifton Webb is the star of this movie -- a fine actor -- but he had the best lines by far. Vincent Price overacted (as he always did), and Dana Andrews literally sleepwalked (nothing new). Gene Tierney just glowed with star quality as ever. I love when old movies can just suggest what's happened thru dialog and acting, instead of beating you over the head and rubbing your face in it. But I did wonder, this time, what Mark and Laura would have in common or even to talk about once they rolled out of bed. Laura is a perfect movie for its time, but I don't believe it would impress my daughter. It would probably be a yawn.

    Laura was a project, based on a pulpy novel by Vera Caspery, that director Otto Preminger had to fight 20th Century Fox Mogul, Daryl Zanuck, to get made. It was a film that everyone else involved in did not believe in and assumed would be a failure. Yet the film went on to be a huge success and was a source of influence for countless film makers and endures as a classic of the golden era of Hollywood. On the face of it, Laura was in the mode of film noir, with the conventional detective investigating the murder of a glamorous and enthralling woman- as-femme-fatale; the film offers the usual twists in narrative structure and the dubious relationships and men surrounding the central figure, and their obsessions, or neuroses; but visually the film separates itself from the dark shadows and brooding atmosphere of the conventional noir films, and brings an obsessive, illuminating Freudian drama of sexual emasculation and the fundamental flaws of masculine desire. Dana Andrews's investigating detective McPherson, is assigned to the murder case of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), an assured, successful woman, surrounded by seemingly rich and powerful men, who was gunned down in her apartment. As he uncovers information about Laura, helped by a portrait hanging on her living room wall, McPherson, like the men he interviews, becomes obsessed with the woman, as her delightful character, and her determined but innocent-like attractiveness envelops him. Clifton Webb's overtly dandy Waldo, a successful columnist, displays his love of Laura through his detailed recollections of their relationship, whilst the charming yet alarmingly vacant Shelby (Vincent Price), a man having affairs with noticeably more than one woman, is the more darkly sinister of the two, and often (perhaps innocently) implicates himself in the murder. About halfway through the film there is a huge narrative shift, which at first is jarring, as the audience is not sure if this is the fantasy or dream of McPherson, but the revelation shifts the story, questioning the reality of the two main suspects. As McPherson is drawn into the elusive Laura's lifestyle, the central focus of much of the narrative is set in the presence of a painting of Laura hanging in her room. It is an idealisation of the woman - she appears dominating in the picture - an image that is captured not by Laura, but by the men around her. This image is easier to handle that the real thing, it is a passive version of the woman. Whilst a lot is put upon the sexual power that Laura has on these men, it is the neuroses and imbalanced psyches of the men. But Laura, as we discover, is a more individual, independent woman, who perhaps does not require the desire of others. So the fantasised painted version of her can be contained and controlled. A reading could suggest that the power that Laura has over these men somehow perpetuates the incitement to murder, but in fact it would be easier to read that it is the breakdown of the masculine that is the determining factor in murder, and not necessarily a woman who is unsure of her decisions when it comes to settling. The performances are phenomenal here. Andrew's hard-boiled detective is excellent, with his proto-Columbo style of investigation, playing games with the suspects, and forcing them into corners. Price and Webb are brilliantly over-the-top - Price giving a sinister performance through the disguise of charisma. But, inevitably, the titular character, through the mysterious, seductive beauty of Tierney, is awesome in a tricksy way. She is not necessarily the traditional femme fatale, she is not consciously playing these men, yet at times the audience is unsure. Is she twisting the delusions of these men to her will? Or is she as sweet as she sometimes appears? It is an almost perfect performance. The influence of this film is undisputed. The James Elroy novel, The Black Dahlia, whilst loosely based on a true-life crime, was undoubtedly broadened by Laura's influence. The Black Dahlia has the central theme of the obsession by an investigator of a dead woman. These themes of obsession must have been directly correlated by David Lynch and Mark Frost when they wrote and conceived of Twin Peaks which began with the death of a high school girl, and the subsequent investigation unravels levels of obsession in a small community, much of which extended from this one girl. It's a wonderful, twisty, and often surprising story that illustrates that the power of women is not always a product of feminine knowing, but the failures and compulsions of weak, lonely men. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Let me horrify you from my first lines, so you can decide right now if you go on reading this review or you'll just pass: Laura is above all about sexual repression in the social upper crust in the 40s. Truth is, I've never seen a flick where it appears so evident that none of the main characters are doing it; or that they are doing it in a enjoyable way. Even worse, they are sublimating their libidosthat one I learned it in Secondary III, in Psychology class--falling in love, or fantasizing, about unreachable ones. If you don't believe it, just mention me a single occasion here where, as the saying goes, two sets of eyes find each other across a crowded room; when a man looks at a woman with lust in his eyes; when two hands rub each other by accident, trying to reach an astray for ex., and faces go red, hands tremble. Nope, there's absolutely no sexual tension in any scene here, no hint that any of these people have normal sexual lives. All you hear in its 87 min. is talk, talk, talk--which is the easiest way of getting rid of the excess libido. But, you'll argue, the same can be said of many flicks; like say, Guns of Navarone. That's true--but people there had good reasons as they were using their libidos to try to win a war. The difference in Laura is, all here are blatantly showcasing their needs, while at the same time trying by all means to have a substitute which would allow them the release without having to go through the experience itself. At its core, Laura is a scathing portrait of how unfulfilling the sex life of this crowd was at that epoch, despite all the ritzy appearances. Here the main focus of sublimated lust of every Joe is Laura herself, the incredibly beautiful yet sexually neutral, anodyne goddess to fantasize about but who'll turn into ashes--or stone?-as soon as you touch her.(this is not meant to be a criticism of Tierney, truly, but if she was such a hot ticket then is because her aseptic beauty fitted best the tastes and conventions of those puritanical, pre--Marilyn times in Hollywood). And of course women will fantasize about men they can't have. At the end the only real crime committed here is having them all licking their chops while not getting any. (BTW, in the original script Laura really died, which means McPherson fell in love with her portrait, following the norm). Now, about the technical aspect, the package, the cinematography, I'm not the first one to say it: Laura is all about style, about beautiful people in beautiful clothes parading in elegant surroundings, drinking champagne and carrying on their beautiful conversations. Speaking of which, I've never seen a flick with more contrived, unnatural, lines of dialog. I was checking all along and I could barely find any case in which a character was taken off guard by someone else's remark and had to pause, think, before giving an answer. It was just like a tennis match, snappy lines coming and going, as if the characters were all reading their lines which of course reveals the artificiality of the whole thing. As for Waldo I can't believe his insulting invectives could pass for witticism at any time, context, social milieu. Are they sure they consulted the right entry in Webster's? And man, does he sound like something is wrong with him. If someone came nowadays talking like that to a hotel desk they would make him lie down, give him some air and call a doctor. Where do they talk like that, in Mensa meetings, in the Save the Platypus organization?. And frankly I don't see this one as a noir. Rather as a flick that purposely started trying to be a noir only to lose its way going there and becoming entangled in a mess of assorted things: drama de moeurs (as the French say), faux--romance, crime thriller, social commentary. The only linking element being, as said, that the characters are not getting any. Noir characters need a least some depth, some dramatic reach, and these here are unbelievable in their shallowness and artificiality, more cardboard cuts than real people. Neither there's any atmosphere, no ambiance, no feel of impending doom. I didn't even feel for Laura when she was "arrested", as at that point I wasn't even looking at her as a real person, just as an image on a screen. Despite it all Laura is half-heartedly recommended, if only to know what the fuss is about. As a plus you have the typical Preminger direction, with his meticulous setting & framing of sceneswith his proverbial economy of shots, as we know--with his expert use of full bodied blacks along with resplendent whites. Most of the action unfolds in interiors, giving him the chance for indulging in luxurious surroundings--gorgeous sculptures, Ming vases, invaluable paintingsto the point that Laura's apartment looks like the ballroom of the Titanic. Or that was Waldo's bathroom...In any case, don't look for emotion, for sexual tension or for depth here. There's no one single relationship having any of that; they all look contrived, specially that of the leads. Just picture it: Laura sees as proof of the cop's love the fact that he arrests her for murder, so he can show her his feelings "in an more official setting". If that doesn't turn you away, then give it a try. 6.0/10.

    This is definitely one of the finest crime thrillers of its times. Otto Preminger was able to direct a movie that is gripping and very mysterious because of the storyline, and at the same time tremendously dialogue-oriented, because of its structure. He gave this noir movie a fine European touch, mainly due to the fact that there aren't any spectacular gun fights, chases or on-screen murders, but the emphasis is put on dialogues, which encourage one's imagination to produce vivid images of the crime. It's a tale of brutal murder, and huge obsession that lead to it. However, the unexpected turn, placed brilliantly somewhere in the middle of the movie, makes it even more suspenseful. The film makes a great use of various flashbacks to show the roots of this enormous obsession and jealousy coming from the side of Waldo Lydecker. Fine narrative voice-over that is somehow very similar to the one used later in Sunset Boulevard. It is supposed to set the mood and impose an intrigue that will satisfy the viewer and make him concentrated on every detail of the story. You can see the director's professionalism in every aspect of the film. For one, he makes a fascinating use of symbolism, and various elements that come with it (namely the two clocks), which ultimately lead to an important discovery, providing the horrifying explanation of this tough case. Dana Andrews is fantastic as a detective, who is serious about his job, but at the same time inescapably falls in love with the girl, whose murder he is investigating. He wants to show how tough and unemotional he can be when it comes to his line of work, but after some time the only thing he cares about is Laura and her safety. Talking about the titular girl: Gene Tierney is really appealing and convincing as pure, seemingly innocent and very amiable Laura. Her mesmerizing beauty makes it very easy to believe that every man falls in love with her right away and wants to have her only to himself. Clifton Webb is great as this really clever and wise writer, who with a little help of his huge intelligence and cunningness is able to convince everyone that he should be the least suspected person in the whole case. All in all, Laura is a very fine thriller with a properly developed plot and well-selected cast of characters. Everyone can be a suspect, just like in all the decent detective tale that you will find. But the somber atmosphere surrounding the story and incredible jealousy and obsessive behavior depicted in it provide for a noir title that everybody should see at least once.

    Laura Hunt is a young, beautiful, hugely successful New York advertising executive. Or rather she was those things. Because as this movie opens Laura is dead. Murdered, a shotgun blast to the face. So who was Laura really? What do we really know about her? Those are intriguing questions. But this movie's big question is of course who killed her? The mystery unfolds with a small handful of suspects and an at times rather peculiar investigation. Along the way we have some flashbacks to help establish who Laura was, how our suspects were connected to her, and why anyone could have possibly wanted to blow this seemingly innocent woman's head off. Because on the surface her murder makes very little sense. As you try to make some sense of it all the movie has some big surprises in store for you. Dana Andrews plays the role of detective Mark McPherson, who in the course of his investigation does some rather unusual things. Things which quite frankly no detective would ever actually do. But we will see he must do these things to move the movie's plot forward. Without this series of contrivances there would be no movie. Rather sloppy plotting it must be said but not so bad as to greatly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. One of McPherson's absurd actions is to allow one of his prime suspects to tag along for interrogations of his other prime suspects. A very contrived way to get all the key players in a room together. That prime suspect is newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker, the man responsible for making Laura who she was. Just ask him, he'll tell you. He loves talking about himself that's for sure. Clifton Webb plays this flamboyant, rather effeminate character. Waldo prances through the movie like a queen but it is apparent that he was quite in love with Laura. Which makes the fact that Laura was about to marry another man quite unacceptable in Waldo's eyes. The man Laura intended to marry is Shelby Carpenter, a not particularly intelligent country bumpkin who somehow finds himself moving in Manhattan's highest social circles. But did Laura really intend to marry Shelby? Waldo would have you believe she was reconsidering the marriage. If Shelby knew that he might certainly have a motive for the murder. Meanwhile Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell, has a thing for Shelby so maybe she wanted Laura out of the way. And Laura's maid also seemed to have an unusually strong affection for Laura. So there are the suspects. The movie then goes through a series of twists and turns, one of which is a real doozy, before all will finally be revealed. This is an intriguing movie but perhaps not quite as engrossing as it may have been. Even at less than ninety minutes the movie seems a bit slow and labored at times. The fact that some of the key story elements are scarcely believable doesn't help. Andrews does an OK job in playing the movie's detective but the fact that detective does so many frankly stupid things sometimes makes it hard to take the guy seriously. Webb floats through the movie on a cloud, chewing as much scenery as he can swallow. But his performance does make for a memorable character. The problem is that when you see Webb's 50-something Waldo with Gene Tierney's beautiful 20-something Laura the love story doesn't ring true. The oddest of odd couples. Then again while Laura had affection for Waldo she was after all intending to marry another man. So it's apparently unrequited love on Waldo's part. That other man, Shelby, is played by Vincent Price. It's not always easy playing a hapless dunce and that's pretty much what Shelby is. But Price does very well in the role. As the aunt and the maid Judith Anderson and Dorothy Adams respectively have less to do. They're pushed forward as possible suspects but the movie focuses most of its attention on Waldo and Shelby. Laura herself gets a little lost but Tierney certainly holds her own when she gets her opportunities. This is a movie which wants to keep you guessing but it doesn't always succeed in that. It certainly surprises you here and there but by the end there's a creeping sense of inevitability. Most in the audience will probably guess the murderer's identity before the movie's detective does. When we get to that ending we find it's just as contrived as much of what has preceded it. Instead of going out with a bang the movie fizzles out in what is slightly disappointing fashion. This isn't a bad murder mystery but it would be hard to call it a truly great one. It has its intriguing elements but the whole ends up being a little less than the sum of its parts.

    A portrait, a painting, a piece of art have always played a decisive role in addressing our emotions and leading our thoughts to some 'idealized reality.' A beautiful woman in the painting has been a focus of interest...men admired her, women envied her; yet both have been affected by her glamor, mystery, detail and style. "A passion for the unavailable," as Petrarch once described the name Laura, is precisely what we encounter in this powerful film noir of the 1940s where one of the most beautiful actresses, Gene Tierney, at last decided to "play a painting." But is it only the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who makes this film one of the most aesthetic and fabulous screen productions? Is the widespread appreciation and applause dedicated only to her? All the merits of the film appear to focus on PORTRAIT, SCORE and ATMOSPHERE. These three aspects, as certain details, seem to create the harmony of the general conclusion after viewing LAURA. As a film noir (one of its very best manifestations), LAURA emphasizes the portrait of "a woman of mystery and glamor" (Gene Tierney)...an advertising executive whom we get to know with New York police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews). Just for curiosity, the portrait was initially painted by director Rouben Mamoulian's wife (first director of the movie) but...as a matter of fact, what we actually find in the movie is a blowup of Gene Tierney's photograph. The portrait leads us to the specific atmosphere of tension, suspicion, glamor, haunt, mystery and the unpredictable effects of murder investigation...the atmosphere at its best! This atmosphere is enriched by magnificent score, a unique work by David Raksin, a novelty at that time promoted by the composer for Fox studio Alfred Newman. His score supplies us with unforgettable feelings while watching the movie and helps the viewers keep interest and suspicion. It beautifully adapts detective elements, sexual references and a sentiment to the scenes. To enrich the atmosphere, we also need to add the flashbacks that play an important role in the movie and explain a lot in discovering the events as well as lead us to a certain reality and emotions. Also, the moody scenes with stunning cinematography add certain moods and resemblance. Another significant aspect of LAURA's artistry are, of course, the performances. Although there are practically not many characters in the movie, casting occurred to be pretty challenging. It is important to keep in mind that the author of the novel, Vera Caspary, badly wanted a screen adaptation but had her word in many decisions, including the portrayals of characters. After the long and tedious process of casting (even Marlene Dietrich was willing to play the lead), the results are fabulous. Gene Tierney portrays a sophisticated woman of the high society, no naive woman, no femme fatale but a strong woman who gets balanced among three men our attention is called upon: the newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) whose vicious charm shapes her decisions and who has, indeed, the strongest power in her life; her fianc&eacute; Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a gentle man who "would not even kill a fly" and the police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) who suspects no one and everyone at the same time. In between the men comes her wealthy aunt, Ann Treadwell memorably portrayed by the highly respected actress whose career illumined both the stage and cinema, Judith Anderson. However, let me consider the male performances in more details. Dana Andrews does a brilliant job as the detective making us not only the observers of the investigation but, thanks to the powerful and effective depiction of indefatigable determination, he lets us into his world where women are 'dames' and where suspicions are daily bread. The most unforgettable scene is when he enters Laura's apartment and the emphasis on details, the dream-like tension and his instantaneous movements occur to be the clarity with no words. Clifton Webb, who portrays the most difficult character, in fact, excellently combines the wretchedness with sympathy, doubt with certainty. He is not a villain and he does not look to be one... He is a man of power, a man of talent, a man of self esteem and mannerisms. He even becomes respectable, even in the eyes of the most suspicious viewers until... Vincent Price has his moments in the film, he is vibrant and genuine in the role; a young and inexperienced in man-woman relation? A little but shy? It occurs quite meaningful to state that both Clifton Webb and Vincent Price started their careers from supporting roles and then became legendary. However, there is yet another legendary name in LAURA that makes this film stand out as a historic production...that is the "tireless" (according to Gene Tierney) director Otto Preminger. Vincent Price memorably stated: "Otto Preminger had an implicit knowledge of pseudo-sophisticated world" and supplied the characters with the 'sense of evil' not making anyone villains. Preminger's great achievement is the fact that he managed to combine a detective story with psychology. His direction makes the film both sophisticated and romantic...I don't doubt that Rouben Mamoulian with his exquisite talents would also have managed that stylish element (he proved that in DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE)...yet, some of his requirements occurred to be of little use for the crew and the author herself. LAURA is a great atmospheric film noir, a provocative mystery combined with the stylish glamor where the haunting score leads us to the glorious portrait of female charm and mystery. 9/10

    Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been murdered, and as New York City Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigates, he finds that everyone seems to be in love with her -- and he, too, gradually falls under her spell. But things aren't always what they seem. Darryl F. Zanuck was opposed to casting Clifton Webb because of his known homosexuality, but Preminger prevailed and the 54-year-old Webb, making his first screen appearance since the silent era, was nominated for an Oscar. Webb really does sell the film, with lines like, "Will you stop calling her a dame? Does this look like the home of a dame? Have you ever known a woman who wasn't a doll or a dame?" Great dignified actor. And speaking of dignified, you have Vincent Price, young and without any facial hair, even before his voice achieved its full distinctiveness. Interestingly, he comes off as a wimp here and seems to go back and forth between stage and screen style acting. (Price always had a very stage quality to his film roles.) Does this film have a connection to "Twin Peaks"? A girl named Laura, murdered, with everyone attracted to her? I do not know... there is no direct connection, but it came to my mind.

    This movie reminds me of Casablanca in that it SHOULD have been just a run-of-the- mill noirish potboiler, but it ends up being so much more than that, thanks to a happy confluence of talents. Just as Bogart and Bergman, with the help of Claude Rains, raise Casablanca to sublimity, so too do Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney raise this material with the considerable help of Clifton Webb. The performances (Vincent Price and Judith Anderson in SUPPORTING roles!?!) mesh together like gears in a Rolex, and it's a pleasure to behold. I know it's been said before, but Gene Tierney's amazing looks make one believe that a detective could fall in love with her portrait. This movie is a superlative exemplar of its genre, and anyone who is a fan of that genre should do themselves a favor and see this film immediately.

    This movie fits on all counts but one! you could have a wild guess who the killer is, while the director tries to provide you with alternative versions to distract you. The movie starts out with the death of a Laura (Gene Tierney), and Detective Mc Pherson (Dana Andrews) trying to investigate the murder. The movie then goes on along McP's collection and rechecking evidence. He tries to soften the suspects by trash talk and trying to read into their reactions. Waldo and Shelby are both in the doubting list and confront McP many times. However, what follows is a classic Noir genre. The twist and the motives are good, effective and worth the 7/10. Looking back at the times when this movie was made, it deserves more than a 7! Hope you enjoy this as much as I have!

    LAURA is a really solid murder mystery with lots of clever dialog most of which are uttered by Clifton Webb's character. Gene Tierney oozes sex even though she is fully clothed all the time. Dana Andrews is tough as nails but his detective character wasn't too well developed. We know he isn't exactly a feminist (When a dame gets killed, she doesn't worry about how she looks.) And him falling in love with Laura was a bit hard to digest. The sinister ending is worth the price of admission. This is a great murder mystery. Obviously some of the characters are there just to make the plot more complicated. (7/10)

    I probably saw this first on TV as early as the 1950's. Have seen it many times since and can probably recite much of the dialog by heart. I agree with most of the positive reviews and I'm glad it has stood the test of time (considering the times in which it was made). I was a young girl so impressed, I named my first daughter, "Laura" -- as much for the beautiful theme as for the character. I also found and read the novel at a used book sale in the late '60s and owned an original copy of the sheet music. I was surprised to find out that this is considered a film noir classic. A film noir with a happy ending? Just the type of old classic movie to thrill a young girl's heart. My impressions then: Laura was a glamorous career woman -- even for the 1950's when I first encountered her, but I enjoyed Gene Tierney's movies, because I could identify with her. Much is said about her socialite and high class background and demure; however, she had an every girl quality too and many educated young women fancied themselves quite sophisticated a la Tierney. Beautiful yes, but there were many actresses even more beautiful. Don't forget the overbite. I most recently saw this movie in the past few years. Clifton Webb is the star of this movie -- a fine actor -- but he had the best lines by far. Vincent Price overacted (as he always did), and Dana Andrews literally sleepwalked (nothing new). Gene Tierney just glowed with star quality as ever. I love when old movies can just suggest what's happened thru dialog and acting, instead of beating you over the head and rubbing your face in it. But I did wonder, this time, what Mark and Laura would have in common or even to talk about once they rolled out of bed. Laura is a perfect movie for its time, but I don't believe it would impress my daughter. It would probably be a yawn.

    Laura was a project, based on a pulpy novel by Vera Caspery, that director Otto Preminger had to fight 20th Century Fox Mogul, Daryl Zanuck, to get made. It was a film that everyone else involved in did not believe in and assumed would be a failure. Yet the film went on to be a huge success and was a source of influence for countless film makers and endures as a classic of the golden era of Hollywood. On the face of it, Laura was in the mode of film noir, with the conventional detective investigating the murder of a glamorous and enthralling woman- as-femme-fatale; the film offers the usual twists in narrative structure and the dubious relationships and men surrounding the central figure, and their obsessions, or neuroses; but visually the film separates itself from the dark shadows and brooding atmosphere of the conventional noir films, and brings an obsessive, illuminating Freudian drama of sexual emasculation and the fundamental flaws of masculine desire. Dana Andrews's investigating detective McPherson, is assigned to the murder case of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), an assured, successful woman, surrounded by seemingly rich and powerful men, who was gunned down in her apartment. As he uncovers information about Laura, helped by a portrait hanging on her living room wall, McPherson, like the men he interviews, becomes obsessed with the woman, as her delightful character, and her determined but innocent-like attractiveness envelops him. Clifton Webb's overtly dandy Waldo, a successful columnist, displays his love of Laura through his detailed recollections of their relationship, whilst the charming yet alarmingly vacant Shelby (Vincent Price), a man having affairs with noticeably more than one woman, is the more darkly sinister of the two, and often (perhaps innocently) implicates himself in the murder. About halfway through the film there is a huge narrative shift, which at first is jarring, as the audience is not sure if this is the fantasy or dream of McPherson, but the revelation shifts the story, questioning the reality of the two main suspects. As McPherson is drawn into the elusive Laura's lifestyle, the central focus of much of the narrative is set in the presence of a painting of Laura hanging in her room. It is an idealisation of the woman - she appears dominating in the picture - an image that is captured not by Laura, but by the men around her. This image is easier to handle that the real thing, it is a passive version of the woman. Whilst a lot is put upon the sexual power that Laura has on these men, it is the neuroses and imbalanced psyches of the men. But Laura, as we discover, is a more individual, independent woman, who perhaps does not require the desire of others. So the fantasised painted version of her can be contained and controlled. A reading could suggest that the power that Laura has over these men somehow perpetuates the incitement to murder, but in fact it would be easier to read that it is the breakdown of the masculine that is the determining factor in murder, and not necessarily a woman who is unsure of her decisions when it comes to settling. The performances are phenomenal here. Andrew's hard-boiled detective is excellent, with his proto-Columbo style of investigation, playing games with the suspects, and forcing them into corners. Price and Webb are brilliantly over-the-top - Price giving a sinister performance through the disguise of charisma. But, inevitably, the titular character, through the mysterious, seductive beauty of Tierney, is awesome in a tricksy way. She is not necessarily the traditional femme fatale, she is not consciously playing these men, yet at times the audience is unsure. Is she twisting the delusions of these men to her will? Or is she as sweet as she sometimes appears? It is an almost perfect performance. The influence of this film is undisputed. The James Elroy novel, The Black Dahlia, whilst loosely based on a true-life crime, was undoubtedly broadened by Laura's influence. The Black Dahlia has the central theme of the obsession by an investigator of a dead woman. These themes of obsession must have been directly correlated by David Lynch and Mark Frost when they wrote and conceived of Twin Peaks which began with the death of a high school girl, and the subsequent investigation unravels levels of obsession in a small community, much of which extended from this one girl. It's a wonderful, twisty, and often surprising story that illustrates that the power of women is not always a product of feminine knowing, but the failures and compulsions of weak, lonely men. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Let me horrify you from my first lines, so you can decide right now if you go on reading this review or you'll just pass: Laura is above all about sexual repression in the social upper crust in the 40s. Truth is, I've never seen a flick where it appears so evident that none of the main characters are doing it; or that they are doing it in a enjoyable way. Even worse, they are sublimating their libidosthat one I learned it in Secondary III, in Psychology class--falling in love, or fantasizing, about unreachable ones. If you don't believe it, just mention me a single occasion here where, as the saying goes, two sets of eyes find each other across a crowded room; when a man looks at a woman with lust in his eyes; when two hands rub each other by accident, trying to reach an astray for ex., and faces go red, hands tremble. Nope, there's absolutely no sexual tension in any scene here, no hint that any of these people have normal sexual lives. All you hear in its 87 min. is talk, talk, talk--which is the easiest way of getting rid of the excess libido. But, you'll argue, the same can be said of many flicks; like say, Guns of Navarone. That's true--but people there had good reasons as they were using their libidos to try to win a war. The difference in Laura is, all here are blatantly showcasing their needs, while at the same time trying by all means to have a substitute which would allow them the release without having to go through the experience itself. At its core, Laura is a scathing portrait of how unfulfilling the sex life of this crowd was at that epoch, despite all the ritzy appearances. Here the main focus of sublimated lust of every Joe is Laura herself, the incredibly beautiful yet sexually neutral, anodyne goddess to fantasize about but who'll turn into ashes--or stone?-as soon as you touch her.(this is not meant to be a criticism of Tierney, truly, but if she was such a hot ticket then is because her aseptic beauty fitted best the tastes and conventions of those puritanical, pre--Marilyn times in Hollywood). And of course women will fantasize about men they can't have. At the end the only real crime committed here is having them all licking their chops while not getting any. (BTW, in the original script Laura really died, which means McPherson fell in love with her portrait, following the norm). Now, about the technical aspect, the package, the cinematography, I'm not the first one to say it: Laura is all about style, about beautiful people in beautiful clothes parading in elegant surroundings, drinking champagne and carrying on their beautiful conversations. Speaking of which, I've never seen a flick with more contrived, unnatural, lines of dialog. I was checking all along and I could barely find any case in which a character was taken off guard by someone else's remark and had to pause, think, before giving an answer. It was just like a tennis match, snappy lines coming and going, as if the characters were all reading their lines which of course reveals the artificiality of the whole thing. As for Waldo I can't believe his insulting invectives could pass for witticism at any time, context, social milieu. Are they sure they consulted the right entry in Webster's? And man, does he sound like something is wrong with him. If someone came nowadays talking like that to a hotel desk they would make him lie down, give him some air and call a doctor. Where do they talk like that, in Mensa meetings, in the Save the Platypus organization?. And frankly I don't see this one as a noir. Rather as a flick that purposely started trying to be a noir only to lose its way going there and becoming entangled in a mess of assorted things: drama de moeurs (as the French say), faux--romance, crime thriller, social commentary. The only linking element being, as said, that the characters are not getting any. Noir characters need a least some depth, some dramatic reach, and these here are unbelievable in their shallowness and artificiality, more cardboard cuts than real people. Neither there's any atmosphere, no ambiance, no feel of impending doom. I didn't even feel for Laura when she was "arrested", as at that point I wasn't even looking at her as a real person, just as an image on a screen. Despite it all Laura is half-heartedly recommended, if only to know what the fuss is about. As a plus you have the typical Preminger direction, with his meticulous setting & framing of sceneswith his proverbial economy of shots, as we know--with his expert use of full bodied blacks along with resplendent whites. Most of the action unfolds in interiors, giving him the chance for indulging in luxurious surroundings--gorgeous sculptures, Ming vases, invaluable paintingsto the point that Laura's apartment looks like the ballroom of the Titanic. Or that was Waldo's bathroom...In any case, don't look for emotion, for sexual tension or for depth here. There's no one single relationship having any of that; they all look contrived, specially that of the leads. Just picture it: Laura sees as proof of the cop's love the fact that he arrests her for murder, so he can show her his feelings "in an more official setting". If that doesn't turn you away, then give it a try. 6.0/10.

    This is definitely one of the finest crime thrillers of its times. Otto Preminger was able to direct a movie that is gripping and very mysterious because of the storyline, and at the same time tremendously dialogue-oriented, because of its structure. He gave this noir movie a fine European touch, mainly due to the fact that there aren't any spectacular gun fights, chases or on-screen murders, but the emphasis is put on dialogues, which encourage one's imagination to produce vivid images of the crime. It's a tale of brutal murder, and huge obsession that lead to it. However, the unexpected turn, placed brilliantly somewhere in the middle of the movie, makes it even more suspenseful. The film makes a great use of various flashbacks to show the roots of this enormous obsession and jealousy coming from the side of Waldo Lydecker. Fine narrative voice-over that is somehow very similar to the one used later in Sunset Boulevard. It is supposed to set the mood and impose an intrigue that will satisfy the viewer and make him concentrated on every detail of the story. You can see the director's professionalism in every aspect of the film. For one, he makes a fascinating use of symbolism, and various elements that come with it (namely the two clocks), which ultimately lead to an important discovery, providing the horrifying explanation of this tough case. Dana Andrews is fantastic as a detective, who is serious about his job, but at the same time inescapably falls in love with the girl, whose murder he is investigating. He wants to show how tough and unemotional he can be when it comes to his line of work, but after some time the only thing he cares about is Laura and her safety. Talking about the titular girl: Gene Tierney is really appealing and convincing as pure, seemingly innocent and very amiable Laura. Her mesmerizing beauty makes it very easy to believe that every man falls in love with her right away and wants to have her only to himself. Clifton Webb is great as this really clever and wise writer, who with a little help of his huge intelligence and cunningness is able to convince everyone that he should be the least suspected person in the whole case. All in all, Laura is a very fine thriller with a properly developed plot and well-selected cast of characters. Everyone can be a suspect, just like in all the decent detective tale that you will find. But the somber atmosphere surrounding the story and incredible jealousy and obsessive behavior depicted in it provide for a noir title that everybody should see at least once.

    Laura Hunt is a young, beautiful, hugely successful New York advertising executive. Or rather she was those things. Because as this movie opens Laura is dead. Murdered, a shotgun blast to the face. So who was Laura really? What do we really know about her? Those are intriguing questions. But this movie's big question is of course who killed her? The mystery unfolds with a small handful of suspects and an at times rather peculiar investigation. Along the way we have some flashbacks to help establish who Laura was, how our suspects were connected to her, and why anyone could have possibly wanted to blow this seemingly innocent woman's head off. Because on the surface her murder makes very little sense. As you try to make some sense of it all the movie has some big surprises in store for you. Dana Andrews plays the role of detective Mark McPherson, who in the course of his investigation does some rather unusual things. Things which quite frankly no detective would ever actually do. But we will see he must do these things to move the movie's plot forward. Without this series of contrivances there would be no movie. Rather sloppy plotting it must be said but not so bad as to greatly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. One of McPherson's absurd actions is to allow one of his prime suspects to tag along for interrogations of his other prime suspects. A very contrived way to get all the key players in a room together. That prime suspect is newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker, the man responsible for making Laura who she was. Just ask him, he'll tell you. He loves talking about himself that's for sure. Clifton Webb plays this flamboyant, rather effeminate character. Waldo prances through the movie like a queen but it is apparent that he was quite in love with Laura. Which makes the fact that Laura was about to marry another man quite unacceptable in Waldo's eyes. The man Laura intended to marry is Shelby Carpenter, a not particularly intelligent country bumpkin who somehow finds himself moving in Manhattan's highest social circles. But did Laura really intend to marry Shelby? Waldo would have you believe she was reconsidering the marriage. If Shelby knew that he might certainly have a motive for the murder. Meanwhile Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell, has a thing for Shelby so maybe she wanted Laura out of the way. And Laura's maid also seemed to have an unusually strong affection for Laura. So there are the suspects. The movie then goes through a series of twists and turns, one of which is a real doozy, before all will finally be revealed. This is an intriguing movie but perhaps not quite as engrossing as it may have been. Even at less than ninety minutes the movie seems a bit slow and labored at times. The fact that some of the key story elements are scarcely believable doesn't help. Andrews does an OK job in playing the movie's detective but the fact that detective does so many frankly stupid things sometimes makes it hard to take the guy seriously. Webb floats through the movie on a cloud, chewing as much scenery as he can swallow. But his performance does make for a memorable character. The problem is that when you see Webb's 50-something Waldo with Gene Tierney's beautiful 20-something Laura the love story doesn't ring true. The oddest of odd couples. Then again while Laura had affection for Waldo she was after all intending to marry another man. So it's apparently unrequited love on Waldo's part. That other man, Shelby, is played by Vincent Price. It's not always easy playing a hapless dunce and that's pretty much what Shelby is. But Price does very well in the role. As the aunt and the maid Judith Anderson and Dorothy Adams respectively have less to do. They're pushed forward as possible suspects but the movie focuses most of its attention on Waldo and Shelby. Laura herself gets a little lost but Tierney certainly holds her own when she gets her opportunities. This is a movie which wants to keep you guessing but it doesn't always succeed in that. It certainly surprises you here and there but by the end there's a creeping sense of inevitability. Most in the audience will probably guess the murderer's identity before the movie's detective does. When we get to that ending we find it's just as contrived as much of what has preceded it. Instead of going out with a bang the movie fizzles out in what is slightly disappointing fashion. This isn't a bad murder mystery but it would be hard to call it a truly great one. It has its intriguing elements but the whole ends up being a little less than the sum of its parts.

    A portrait, a painting, a piece of art have always played a decisive role in addressing our emotions and leading our thoughts to some 'idealized reality.' A beautiful woman in the painting has been a focus of interest...men admired her, women envied her; yet both have been affected by her glamor, mystery, detail and style. "A passion for the unavailable," as Petrarch once described the name Laura, is precisely what we encounter in this powerful film noir of the 1940s where one of the most beautiful actresses, Gene Tierney, at last decided to "play a painting." But is it only the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who makes this film one of the most aesthetic and fabulous screen productions? Is the widespread appreciation and applause dedicated only to her? All the merits of the film appear to focus on PORTRAIT, SCORE and ATMOSPHERE. These three aspects, as certain details, seem to create the harmony of the general conclusion after viewing LAURA. As a film noir (one of its very best manifestations), LAURA emphasizes the portrait of "a woman of mystery and glamor" (Gene Tierney)...an advertising executive whom we get to know with New York police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews). Just for curiosity, the portrait was initially painted by director Rouben Mamoulian's wife (first director of the movie) but...as a matter of fact, what we actually find in the movie is a blowup of Gene Tierney's photograph. The portrait leads us to the specific atmosphere of tension, suspicion, glamor, haunt, mystery and the unpredictable effects of murder investigation...the atmosphere at its best! This atmosphere is enriched by magnificent score, a unique work by David Raksin, a novelty at that time promoted by the composer for Fox studio Alfred Newman. His score supplies us with unforgettable feelings while watching the movie and helps the viewers keep interest and suspicion. It beautifully adapts detective elements, sexual references and a sentiment to the scenes. To enrich the atmosphere, we also need to add the flashbacks that play an important role in the movie and explain a lot in discovering the events as well as lead us to a certain reality and emotions. Also, the moody scenes with stunning cinematography add certain moods and resemblance. Another significant aspect of LAURA's artistry are, of course, the performances. Although there are practically not many characters in the movie, casting occurred to be pretty challenging. It is important to keep in mind that the author of the novel, Vera Caspary, badly wanted a screen adaptation but had her word in many decisions, including the portrayals of characters. After the long and tedious process of casting (even Marlene Dietrich was willing to play the lead), the results are fabulous. Gene Tierney portrays a sophisticated woman of the high society, no naive woman, no femme fatale but a strong woman who gets balanced among three men our attention is called upon: the newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) whose vicious charm shapes her decisions and who has, indeed, the strongest power in her life; her fianc&eacute; Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a gentle man who "would not even kill a fly" and the police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) who suspects no one and everyone at the same time. In between the men comes her wealthy aunt, Ann Treadwell memorably portrayed by the highly respected actress whose career illumined both the stage and cinema, Judith Anderson. However, let me consider the male performances in more details. Dana Andrews does a brilliant job as the detective making us not only the observers of the investigation but, thanks to the powerful and effective depiction of indefatigable determination, he lets us into his world where women are 'dames' and where suspicions are daily bread. The most unforgettable scene is when he enters Laura's apartment and the emphasis on details, the dream-like tension and his instantaneous movements occur to be the clarity with no words. Clifton Webb, who portrays the most difficult character, in fact, excellently combines the wretchedness with sympathy, doubt with certainty. He is not a villain and he does not look to be one... He is a man of power, a man of talent, a man of self esteem and mannerisms. He even becomes respectable, even in the eyes of the most suspicious viewers until... Vincent Price has his moments in the film, he is vibrant and genuine in the role; a young and inexperienced in man-woman relation? A little but shy? It occurs quite meaningful to state that both Clifton Webb and Vincent Price started their careers from supporting roles and then became legendary. However, there is yet another legendary name in LAURA that makes this film stand out as a historic production...that is the "tireless" (according to Gene Tierney) director Otto Preminger. Vincent Price memorably stated: "Otto Preminger had an implicit knowledge of pseudo-sophisticated world" and supplied the characters with the 'sense of evil' not making anyone villains. Preminger's great achievement is the fact that he managed to combine a detective story with psychology. His direction makes the film both sophisticated and romantic...I don't doubt that Rouben Mamoulian with his exquisite talents would also have managed that stylish element (he proved that in DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE)...yet, some of his requirements occurred to be of little use for the crew and the author herself. LAURA is a great atmospheric film noir, a provocative mystery combined with the stylish glamor where the haunting score leads us to the glorious portrait of female charm and mystery. 9/10

    Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been murdered, and as New York City Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigates, he finds that everyone seems to be in love with her -- and he, too, gradually falls under her spell. But things aren't always what they seem. Darryl F. Zanuck was opposed to casting Clifton Webb because of his known homosexuality, but Preminger prevailed and the 54-year-old Webb, making his first screen appearance since the silent era, was nominated for an Oscar. Webb really does sell the film, with lines like, "Will you stop calling her a dame? Does this look like the home of a dame? Have you ever known a woman who wasn't a doll or a dame?" Great dignified actor. And speaking of dignified, you have Vincent Price, young and without any facial hair, even before his voice achieved its full distinctiveness. Interestingly, he comes off as a wimp here and seems to go back and forth between stage and screen style acting. (Price always had a very stage quality to his film roles.) Does this film have a connection to "Twin Peaks"? A girl named Laura, murdered, with everyone attracted to her? I do not know... there is no direct connection, but it came to my mind.

    This movie reminds me of Casablanca in that it SHOULD have been just a run-of-the- mill noirish potboiler, but it ends up being so much more than that, thanks to a happy confluence of talents. Just as Bogart and Bergman, with the help of Claude Rains, raise Casablanca to sublimity, so too do Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney raise this material with the considerable help of Clifton Webb. The performances (Vincent Price and Judith Anderson in SUPPORTING roles!?!) mesh together like gears in a Rolex, and it's a pleasure to behold. I know it's been said before, but Gene Tierney's amazing looks make one believe that a detective could fall in love with her portrait. This movie is a superlative exemplar of its genre, and anyone who is a fan of that genre should do themselves a favor and see this film immediately.

    This movie fits on all counts but one! you could have a wild guess who the killer is, while the director tries to provide you with alternative versions to distract you. The movie starts out with the death of a Laura (Gene Tierney), and Detective Mc Pherson (Dana Andrews) trying to investigate the murder. The movie then goes on along McP's collection and rechecking evidence. He tries to soften the suspects by trash talk and trying to read into their reactions. Waldo and Shelby are both in the doubting list and confront McP many times. However, what follows is a classic Noir genre. The twist and the motives are good, effective and worth the 7/10. Looking back at the times when this movie was made, it deserves more than a 7! Hope you enjoy this as much as I have!

    LAURA is a really solid murder mystery with lots of clever dialog most of which are uttered by Clifton Webb's character. Gene Tierney oozes sex even though she is fully clothed all the time. Dana Andrews is tough as nails but his detective character wasn't too well developed. We know he isn't exactly a feminist (When a dame gets killed, she doesn't worry about how she looks.) And him falling in love with Laura was a bit hard to digest. The sinister ending is worth the price of admission. This is a great murder mystery. Obviously some of the characters are there just to make the plot more complicated. (7/10)

    I probably saw this first on TV as early as the 1950's. Have seen it many times since and can probably recite much of the dialog by heart. I agree with most of the positive reviews and I'm glad it has stood the test of time (considering the times in which it was made). I was a young girl so impressed, I named my first daughter, "Laura" -- as much for the beautiful theme as for the character. I also found and read the novel at a used book sale in the late '60s and owned an original copy of the sheet music. I was surprised to find out that this is considered a film noir classic. A film noir with a happy ending? Just the type of old classic movie to thrill a young girl's heart. My impressions then: Laura was a glamorous career woman -- even for the 1950's when I first encountered her, but I enjoyed Gene Tierney's movies, because I could identify with her. Much is said about her socialite and high class background and demure; however, she had an every girl quality too and many educated young women fancied themselves quite sophisticated a la Tierney. Beautiful yes, but there were many actresses even more beautiful. Don't forget the overbite. I most recently saw this movie in the past few years. Clifton Webb is the star of this movie -- a fine actor -- but he had the best lines by far. Vincent Price overacted (as he always did), and Dana Andrews literally sleepwalked (nothing new). Gene Tierney just glowed with star quality as ever. I love when old movies can just suggest what's happened thru dialog and acting, instead of beating you over the head and rubbing your face in it. But I did wonder, this time, what Mark and Laura would have in common or even to talk about once they rolled out of bed. Laura is a perfect movie for its time, but I don't believe it would impress my daughter. It would probably be a yawn.

    Laura was a project, based on a pulpy novel by Vera Caspery, that director Otto Preminger had to fight 20th Century Fox Mogul, Daryl Zanuck, to get made. It was a film that everyone else involved in did not believe in and assumed would be a failure. Yet the film went on to be a huge success and was a source of influence for countless film makers and endures as a classic of the golden era of Hollywood. On the face of it, Laura was in the mode of film noir, with the conventional detective investigating the murder of a glamorous and enthralling woman- as-femme-fatale; the film offers the usual twists in narrative structure and the dubious relationships and men surrounding the central figure, and their obsessions, or neuroses; but visually the film separates itself from the dark shadows and brooding atmosphere of the conventional noir films, and brings an obsessive, illuminating Freudian drama of sexual emasculation and the fundamental flaws of masculine desire. Dana Andrews's investigating detective McPherson, is assigned to the murder case of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), an assured, successful woman, surrounded by seemingly rich and powerful men, who was gunned down in her apartment. As he uncovers information about Laura, helped by a portrait hanging on her living room wall, McPherson, like the men he interviews, becomes obsessed with the woman, as her delightful character, and her determined but innocent-like attractiveness envelops him. Clifton Webb's overtly dandy Waldo, a successful columnist, displays his love of Laura through his detailed recollections of their relationship, whilst the charming yet alarmingly vacant Shelby (Vincent Price), a man having affairs with noticeably more than one woman, is the more darkly sinister of the two, and often (perhaps innocently) implicates himself in the murder. About halfway through the film there is a huge narrative shift, which at first is jarring, as the audience is not sure if this is the fantasy or dream of McPherson, but the revelation shifts the story, questioning the reality of the two main suspects. As McPherson is drawn into the elusive Laura's lifestyle, the central focus of much of the narrative is set in the presence of a painting of Laura hanging in her room. It is an idealisation of the woman - she appears dominating in the picture - an image that is captured not by Laura, but by the men around her. This image is easier to handle that the real thing, it is a passive version of the woman. Whilst a lot is put upon the sexual power that Laura has on these men, it is the neuroses and imbalanced psyches of the men. But Laura, as we discover, is a more individual, independent woman, who perhaps does not require the desire of others. So the fantasised painted version of her can be contained and controlled. A reading could suggest that the power that Laura has over these men somehow perpetuates the incitement to murder, but in fact it would be easier to read that it is the breakdown of the masculine that is the determining factor in murder, and not necessarily a woman who is unsure of her decisions when it comes to settling. The performances are phenomenal here. Andrew's hard-boiled detective is excellent, with his proto-Columbo style of investigation, playing games with the suspects, and forcing them into corners. Price and Webb are brilliantly over-the-top - Price giving a sinister performance through the disguise of charisma. But, inevitably, the titular character, through the mysterious, seductive beauty of Tierney, is awesome in a tricksy way. She is not necessarily the traditional femme fatale, she is not consciously playing these men, yet at times the audience is unsure. Is she twisting the delusions of these men to her will? Or is she as sweet as she sometimes appears? It is an almost perfect performance. The influence of this film is undisputed. The James Elroy novel, The Black Dahlia, whilst loosely based on a true-life crime, was undoubtedly broadened by Laura's influence. The Black Dahlia has the central theme of the obsession by an investigator of a dead woman. These themes of obsession must have been directly correlated by David Lynch and Mark Frost when they wrote and conceived of Twin Peaks which began with the death of a high school girl, and the subsequent investigation unravels levels of obsession in a small community, much of which extended from this one girl. It's a wonderful, twisty, and often surprising story that illustrates that the power of women is not always a product of feminine knowing, but the failures and compulsions of weak, lonely men. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Let me horrify you from my first lines, so you can decide right now if you go on reading this review or you'll just pass: Laura is above all about sexual repression in the social upper crust in the 40s. Truth is, I've never seen a flick where it appears so evident that none of the main characters are doing it; or that they are doing it in a enjoyable way. Even worse, they are sublimating their libidosthat one I learned it in Secondary III, in Psychology class--falling in love, or fantasizing, about unreachable ones. If you don't believe it, just mention me a single occasion here where, as the saying goes, two sets of eyes find each other across a crowded room; when a man looks at a woman with lust in his eyes; when two hands rub each other by accident, trying to reach an astray for ex., and faces go red, hands tremble. Nope, there's absolutely no sexual tension in any scene here, no hint that any of these people have normal sexual lives. All you hear in its 87 min. is talk, talk, talk--which is the easiest way of getting rid of the excess libido. But, you'll argue, the same can be said of many flicks; like say, Guns of Navarone. That's true--but people there had good reasons as they were using their libidos to try to win a war. The difference in Laura is, all here are blatantly showcasing their needs, while at the same time trying by all means to have a substitute which would allow them the release without having to go through the experience itself. At its core, Laura is a scathing portrait of how unfulfilling the sex life of this crowd was at that epoch, despite all the ritzy appearances. Here the main focus of sublimated lust of every Joe is Laura herself, the incredibly beautiful yet sexually neutral, anodyne goddess to fantasize about but who'll turn into ashes--or stone?-as soon as you touch her.(this is not meant to be a criticism of Tierney, truly, but if she was such a hot ticket then is because her aseptic beauty fitted best the tastes and conventions of those puritanical, pre--Marilyn times in Hollywood). And of course women will fantasize about men they can't have. At the end the only real crime committed here is having them all licking their chops while not getting any. (BTW, in the original script Laura really died, which means McPherson fell in love with her portrait, following the norm). Now, about the technical aspect, the package, the cinematography, I'm not the first one to say it: Laura is all about style, about beautiful people in beautiful clothes parading in elegant surroundings, drinking champagne and carrying on their beautiful conversations. Speaking of which, I've never seen a flick with more contrived, unnatural, lines of dialog. I was checking all along and I could barely find any case in which a character was taken off guard by someone else's remark and had to pause, think, before giving an answer. It was just like a tennis match, snappy lines coming and going, as if the characters were all reading their lines which of course reveals the artificiality of the whole thing. As for Waldo I can't believe his insulting invectives could pass for witticism at any time, context, social milieu. Are they sure they consulted the right entry in Webster's? And man, does he sound like something is wrong with him. If someone came nowadays talking like that to a hotel desk they would make him lie down, give him some air and call a doctor. Where do they talk like that, in Mensa meetings, in the Save the Platypus organization?. And frankly I don't see this one as a noir. Rather as a flick that purposely started trying to be a noir only to lose its way going there and becoming entangled in a mess of assorted things: drama de moeurs (as the French say), faux--romance, crime thriller, social commentary. The only linking element being, as said, that the characters are not getting any. Noir characters need a least some depth, some dramatic reach, and these here are unbelievable in their shallowness and artificiality, more cardboard cuts than real people. Neither there's any atmosphere, no ambiance, no feel of impending doom. I didn't even feel for Laura when she was "arrested", as at that point I wasn't even looking at her as a real person, just as an image on a screen. Despite it all Laura is half-heartedly recommended, if only to know what the fuss is about. As a plus you have the typical Preminger direction, with his meticulous setting & framing of sceneswith his proverbial economy of shots, as we know--with his expert use of full bodied blacks along with resplendent whites. Most of the action unfolds in interiors, giving him the chance for indulging in luxurious surroundings--gorgeous sculptures, Ming vases, invaluable paintingsto the point that Laura's apartment looks like the ballroom of the Titanic. Or that was Waldo's bathroom...In any case, don't look for emotion, for sexual tension or for depth here. There's no one single relationship having any of that; they all look contrived, specially that of the leads. Just picture it: Laura sees as proof of the cop's love the fact that he arrests her for murder, so he can show her his feelings "in an more official setting". If that doesn't turn you away, then give it a try. 6.0/10.

    This is definitely one of the finest crime thrillers of its times. Otto Preminger was able to direct a movie that is gripping and very mysterious because of the storyline, and at the same time tremendously dialogue-oriented, because of its structure. He gave this noir movie a fine European touch, mainly due to the fact that there aren't any spectacular gun fights, chases or on-screen murders, but the emphasis is put on dialogues, which encourage one's imagination to produce vivid images of the crime. It's a tale of brutal murder, and huge obsession that lead to it. However, the unexpected turn, placed brilliantly somewhere in the middle of the movie, makes it even more suspenseful. The film makes a great use of various flashbacks to show the roots of this enormous obsession and jealousy coming from the side of Waldo Lydecker. Fine narrative voice-over that is somehow very similar to the one used later in Sunset Boulevard. It is supposed to set the mood and impose an intrigue that will satisfy the viewer and make him concentrated on every detail of the story. You can see the director's professionalism in every aspect of the film. For one, he makes a fascinating use of symbolism, and various elements that come with it (namely the two clocks), which ultimately lead to an important discovery, providing the horrifying explanation of this tough case. Dana Andrews is fantastic as a detective, who is serious about his job, but at the same time inescapably falls in love with the girl, whose murder he is investigating. He wants to show how tough and unemotional he can be when it comes to his line of work, but after some time the only thing he cares about is Laura and her safety. Talking about the titular girl: Gene Tierney is really appealing and convincing as pure, seemingly innocent and very amiable Laura. Her mesmerizing beauty makes it very easy to believe that every man falls in love with her right away and wants to have her only to himself. Clifton Webb is great as this really clever and wise writer, who with a little help of his huge intelligence and cunningness is able to convince everyone that he should be the least suspected person in the whole case. All in all, Laura is a very fine thriller with a properly developed plot and well-selected cast of characters. Everyone can be a suspect, just like in all the decent detective tale that you will find. But the somber atmosphere surrounding the story and incredible jealousy and obsessive behavior depicted in it provide for a noir title that everybody should see at least once.

    Laura Hunt is a young, beautiful, hugely successful New York advertising executive. Or rather she was those things. Because as this movie opens Laura is dead. Murdered, a shotgun blast to the face. So who was Laura really? What do we really know about her? Those are intriguing questions. But this movie's big question is of course who killed her? The mystery unfolds with a small handful of suspects and an at times rather peculiar investigation. Along the way we have some flashbacks to help establish who Laura was, how our suspects were connected to her, and why anyone could have possibly wanted to blow this seemingly innocent woman's head off. Because on the surface her murder makes very little sense. As you try to make some sense of it all the movie has some big surprises in store for you. Dana Andrews plays the role of detective Mark McPherson, who in the course of his investigation does some rather unusual things. Things which quite frankly no detective would ever actually do. But we will see he must do these things to move the movie's plot forward. Without this series of contrivances there would be no movie. Rather sloppy plotting it must be said but not so bad as to greatly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. One of McPherson's absurd actions is to allow one of his prime suspects to tag along for interrogations of his other prime suspects. A very contrived way to get all the key players in a room together. That prime suspect is newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker, the man responsible for making Laura who she was. Just ask him, he'll tell you. He loves talking about himself that's for sure. Clifton Webb plays this flamboyant, rather effeminate character. Waldo prances through the movie like a queen but it is apparent that he was quite in love with Laura. Which makes the fact that Laura was about to marry another man quite unacceptable in Waldo's eyes. The man Laura intended to marry is Shelby Carpenter, a not particularly intelligent country bumpkin who somehow finds himself moving in Manhattan's highest social circles. But did Laura really intend to marry Shelby? Waldo would have you believe she was reconsidering the marriage. If Shelby knew that he might certainly have a motive for the murder. Meanwhile Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell, has a thing for Shelby so maybe she wanted Laura out of the way. And Laura's maid also seemed to have an unusually strong affection for Laura. So there are the suspects. The movie then goes through a series of twists and turns, one of which is a real doozy, before all will finally be revealed. This is an intriguing movie but perhaps not quite as engrossing as it may have been. Even at less than ninety minutes the movie seems a bit slow and labored at times. The fact that some of the key story elements are scarcely believable doesn't help. Andrews does an OK job in playing the movie's detective but the fact that detective does so many frankly stupid things sometimes makes it hard to take the guy seriously. Webb floats through the movie on a cloud, chewing as much scenery as he can swallow. But his performance does make for a memorable character. The problem is that when you see Webb's 50-something Waldo with Gene Tierney's beautiful 20-something Laura the love story doesn't ring true. The oddest of odd couples. Then again while Laura had affection for Waldo she was after all intending to marry another man. So it's apparently unrequited love on Waldo's part. That other man, Shelby, is played by Vincent Price. It's not always easy playing a hapless dunce and that's pretty much what Shelby is. But Price does very well in the role. As the aunt and the maid Judith Anderson and Dorothy Adams respectively have less to do. They're pushed forward as possible suspects but the movie focuses most of its attention on Waldo and Shelby. Laura herself gets a little lost but Tierney certainly holds her own when she gets her opportunities. This is a movie which wants to keep you guessing but it doesn't always succeed in that. It certainly surprises you here and there but by the end there's a creeping sense of inevitability. Most in the audience will probably guess the murderer's identity before the movie's detective does. When we get to that ending we find it's just as contrived as much of what has preceded it. Instead of going out with a bang the movie fizzles out in what is slightly disappointing fashion. This isn't a bad murder mystery but it would be hard to call it a truly great one. It has its intriguing elements but the whole ends up being a little less than the sum of its parts.

    A portrait, a painting, a piece of art have always played a decisive role in addressing our emotions and leading our thoughts to some 'idealized reality.' A beautiful woman in the painting has been a focus of interest...men admired her, women envied her; yet both have been affected by her glamor, mystery, detail and style. "A passion for the unavailable," as Petrarch once described the name Laura, is precisely what we encounter in this powerful film noir of the 1940s where one of the most beautiful actresses, Gene Tierney, at last decided to "play a painting." But is it only the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who makes this film one of the most aesthetic and fabulous screen productions? Is the widespread appreciation and applause dedicated only to her? All the merits of the film appear to focus on PORTRAIT, SCORE and ATMOSPHERE. These three aspects, as certain details, seem to create the harmony of the general conclusion after viewing LAURA. As a film noir (one of its very best manifestations), LAURA emphasizes the portrait of "a woman of mystery and glamor" (Gene Tierney)...an advertising executive whom we get to know with New York police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews). Just for curiosity, the portrait was initially painted by director Rouben Mamoulian's wife (first director of the movie) but...as a matter of fact, what we actually find in the movie is a blowup of Gene Tierney's photograph. The portrait leads us to the specific atmosphere of tension, suspicion, glamor, haunt, mystery and the unpredictable effects of murder investigation...the atmosphere at its best! This atmosphere is enriched by magnificent score, a unique work by David Raksin, a novelty at that time promoted by the composer for Fox studio Alfred Newman. His score supplies us with unforgettable feelings while watching the movie and helps the viewers keep interest and suspicion. It beautifully adapts detective elements, sexual references and a sentiment to the scenes. To enrich the atmosphere, we also need to add the flashbacks that play an important role in the movie and explain a lot in discovering the events as well as lead us to a certain reality and emotions. Also, the moody scenes with stunning cinematography add certain moods and resemblance. Another significant aspect of LAURA's artistry are, of course, the performances. Although there are practically not many characters in the movie, casting occurred to be pretty challenging. It is important to keep in mind that the author of the novel, Vera Caspary, badly wanted a screen adaptation but had her word in many decisions, including the portrayals of characters. After the long and tedious process of casting (even Marlene Dietrich was willing to play the lead), the results are fabulous. Gene Tierney portrays a sophisticated woman of the high society, no naive woman, no femme fatale but a strong woman who gets balanced among three men our attention is called upon: the newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) whose vicious charm shapes her decisions and who has, indeed, the strongest power in her life; her fianc&eacute; Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a gentle man who "would not even kill a fly" and the police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) who suspects no one and everyone at the same time. In between the men comes her wealthy aunt, Ann Treadwell memorably portrayed by the highly respected actress whose career illumined both the stage and cinema, Judith Anderson. However, let me consider the male performances in more details. Dana Andrews does a brilliant job as the detective making us not only the observers of the investigation but, thanks to the powerful and effective depiction of indefatigable determination, he lets us into his world where women are 'dames' and where suspicions are daily bread. The most unforgettable scene is when he enters Laura's apartment and the emphasis on details, the dream-like tension and his instantaneous movements occur to be the clarity with no words. Clifton Webb, who portrays the most difficult character, in fact, excellently combines the wretchedness with sympathy, doubt with certainty. He is not a villain and he does not look to be one... He is a man of power, a man of talent, a man of self esteem and mannerisms. He even becomes respectable, even in the eyes of the most suspicious viewers until... Vincent Price has his moments in the film, he is vibrant and genuine in the role; a young and inexperienced in man-woman relation? A little but shy? It occurs quite meaningful to state that both Clifton Webb and Vincent Price started their careers from supporting roles and then became legendary. However, there is yet another legendary name in LAURA that makes this film stand out as a historic production...that is the "tireless" (according to Gene Tierney) director Otto Preminger. Vincent Price memorably stated: "Otto Preminger had an implicit knowledge of pseudo-sophisticated world" and supplied the characters with the 'sense of evil' not making anyone villains. Preminger's great achievement is the fact that he managed to combine a detective story with psychology. His direction makes the film both sophisticated and romantic...I don't doubt that Rouben Mamoulian with his exquisite talents would also have managed that stylish element (he proved that in DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE)...yet, some of his requirements occurred to be of little use for the crew and the author herself. LAURA is a great atmospheric film noir, a provocative mystery combined with the stylish glamor where the haunting score leads us to the glorious portrait of female charm and mystery. 9/10

    Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been murdered, and as New York City Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigates, he finds that everyone seems to be in love with her -- and he, too, gradually falls under her spell. But things aren't always what they seem. Darryl F. Zanuck was opposed to casting Clifton Webb because of his known homosexuality, but Preminger prevailed and the 54-year-old Webb, making his first screen appearance since the silent era, was nominated for an Oscar. Webb really does sell the film, with lines like, "Will you stop calling her a dame? Does this look like the home of a dame? Have you ever known a woman who wasn't a doll or a dame?" Great dignified actor. And speaking of dignified, you have Vincent Price, young and without any facial hair, even before his voice achieved its full distinctiveness. Interestingly, he comes off as a wimp here and seems to go back and forth between stage and screen style acting. (Price always had a very stage quality to his film roles.) Does this film have a connection to "Twin Peaks"? A girl named Laura, murdered, with everyone attracted to her? I do not know... there is no direct connection, but it came to my mind.

    This movie reminds me of Casablanca in that it SHOULD have been just a run-of-the- mill noirish potboiler, but it ends up being so much more than that, thanks to a happy confluence of talents. Just as Bogart and Bergman, with the help of Claude Rains, raise Casablanca to sublimity, so too do Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney raise this material with the considerable help of Clifton Webb. The performances (Vincent Price and Judith Anderson in SUPPORTING roles!?!) mesh together like gears in a Rolex, and it's a pleasure to behold. I know it's been said before, but Gene Tierney's amazing looks make one believe that a detective could fall in love with her portrait. This movie is a superlative exemplar of its genre, and anyone who is a fan of that genre should do themselves a favor and see this film immediately.

    This movie fits on all counts but one! you could have a wild guess who the killer is, while the director tries to provide you with alternative versions to distract you. The movie starts out with the death of a Laura (Gene Tierney), and Detective Mc Pherson (Dana Andrews) trying to investigate the murder. The movie then goes on along McP's collection and rechecking evidence. He tries to soften the suspects by trash talk and trying to read into their reactions. Waldo and Shelby are both in the doubting list and confront McP many times. However, what follows is a classic Noir genre. The twist and the motives are good, effective and worth the 7/10. Looking back at the times when this movie was made, it deserves more than a 7! Hope you enjoy this as much as I have!

    LAURA is a really solid murder mystery with lots of clever dialog most of which are uttered by Clifton Webb's character. Gene Tierney oozes sex even though she is fully clothed all the time. Dana Andrews is tough as nails but his detective character wasn't too well developed. We know he isn't exactly a feminist (When a dame gets killed, she doesn't worry about how she looks.) And him falling in love with Laura was a bit hard to digest. The sinister ending is worth the price of admission. This is a great murder mystery. Obviously some of the characters are there just to make the plot more complicated. (7/10)

    I probably saw this first on TV as early as the 1950's. Have seen it many times since and can probably recite much of the dialog by heart. I agree with most of the positive reviews and I'm glad it has stood the test of time (considering the times in which it was made). I was a young girl so impressed, I named my first daughter, "Laura" -- as much for the beautiful theme as for the character. I also found and read the novel at a used book sale in the late '60s and owned an original copy of the sheet music. I was surprised to find out that this is considered a film noir classic. A film noir with a happy ending? Just the type of old classic movie to thrill a young girl's heart. My impressions then: Laura was a glamorous career woman -- even for the 1950's when I first encountered her, but I enjoyed Gene Tierney's movies, because I could identify with her. Much is said about her socialite and high class background and demure; however, she had an every girl quality too and many educated young women fancied themselves quite sophisticated a la Tierney. Beautiful yes, but there were many actresses even more beautiful. Don't forget the overbite. I most recently saw this movie in the past few years. Clifton Webb is the star of this movie -- a fine actor -- but he had the best lines by far. Vincent Price overacted (as he always did), and Dana Andrews literally sleepwalked (nothing new). Gene Tierney just glowed with star quality as ever. I love when old movies can just suggest what's happened thru dialog and acting, instead of beating you over the head and rubbing your face in it. But I did wonder, this time, what Mark and Laura would have in common or even to talk about once they rolled out of bed. Laura is a perfect movie for its time, but I don't believe it would impress my daughter. It would probably be a yawn.

    Laura was a project, based on a pulpy novel by Vera Caspery, that director Otto Preminger had to fight 20th Century Fox Mogul, Daryl Zanuck, to get made. It was a film that everyone else involved in did not believe in and assumed would be a failure. Yet the film went on to be a huge success and was a source of influence for countless film makers and endures as a classic of the golden era of Hollywood. On the face of it, Laura was in the mode of film noir, with the conventional detective investigating the murder of a glamorous and enthralling woman- as-femme-fatale; the film offers the usual twists in narrative structure and the dubious relationships and men surrounding the central figure, and their obsessions, or neuroses; but visually the film separates itself from the dark shadows and brooding atmosphere of the conventional noir films, and brings an obsessive, illuminating Freudian drama of sexual emasculation and the fundamental flaws of masculine desire. Dana Andrews's investigating detective McPherson, is assigned to the murder case of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), an assured, successful woman, surrounded by seemingly rich and powerful men, who was gunned down in her apartment. As he uncovers information about Laura, helped by a portrait hanging on her living room wall, McPherson, like the men he interviews, becomes obsessed with the woman, as her delightful character, and her determined but innocent-like attractiveness envelops him. Clifton Webb's overtly dandy Waldo, a successful columnist, displays his love of Laura through his detailed recollections of their relationship, whilst the charming yet alarmingly vacant Shelby (Vincent Price), a man having affairs with noticeably more than one woman, is the more darkly sinister of the two, and often (perhaps innocently) implicates himself in the murder. About halfway through the film there is a huge narrative shift, which at first is jarring, as the audience is not sure if this is the fantasy or dream of McPherson, but the revelation shifts the story, questioning the reality of the two main suspects. As McPherson is drawn into the elusive Laura's lifestyle, the central focus of much of the narrative is set in the presence of a painting of Laura hanging in her room. It is an idealisation of the woman - she appears dominating in the picture - an image that is captured not by Laura, but by the men around her. This image is easier to handle that the real thing, it is a passive version of the woman. Whilst a lot is put upon the sexual power that Laura has on these men, it is the neuroses and imbalanced psyches of the men. But Laura, as we discover, is a more individual, independent woman, who perhaps does not require the desire of others. So the fantasised painted version of her can be contained and controlled. A reading could suggest that the power that Laura has over these men somehow perpetuates the incitement to murder, but in fact it would be easier to read that it is the breakdown of the masculine that is the determining factor in murder, and not necessarily a woman who is unsure of her decisions when it comes to settling. The performances are phenomenal here. Andrew's hard-boiled detective is excellent, with his proto-Columbo style of investigation, playing games with the suspects, and forcing them into corners. Price and Webb are brilliantly over-the-top - Price giving a sinister performance through the disguise of charisma. But, inevitably, the titular character, through the mysterious, seductive beauty of Tierney, is awesome in a tricksy way. She is not necessarily the traditional femme fatale, she is not consciously playing these men, yet at times the audience is unsure. Is she twisting the delusions of these men to her will? Or is she as sweet as she sometimes appears? It is an almost perfect performance. The influence of this film is undisputed. The James Elroy novel, The Black Dahlia, whilst loosely based on a true-life crime, was undoubtedly broadened by Laura's influence. The Black Dahlia has the central theme of the obsession by an investigator of a dead woman. These themes of obsession must have been directly correlated by David Lynch and Mark Frost when they wrote and conceived of Twin Peaks which began with the death of a high school girl, and the subsequent investigation unravels levels of obsession in a small community, much of which extended from this one girl. It's a wonderful, twisty, and often surprising story that illustrates that the power of women is not always a product of feminine knowing, but the failures and compulsions of weak, lonely men. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com

    Let me horrify you from my first lines, so you can decide right now if you go on reading this review or you'll just pass: Laura is above all about sexual repression in the social upper crust in the 40s. Truth is, I've never seen a flick where it appears so evident that none of the main characters are doing it; or that they are doing it in a enjoyable way. Even worse, they are sublimating their libidosthat one I learned it in Secondary III, in Psychology class--falling in love, or fantasizing, about unreachable ones. If you don't believe it, just mention me a single occasion here where, as the saying goes, two sets of eyes find each other across a crowded room; when a man looks at a woman with lust in his eyes; when two hands rub each other by accident, trying to reach an astray for ex., and faces go red, hands tremble. Nope, there's absolutely no sexual tension in any scene here, no hint that any of these people have normal sexual lives. All you hear in its 87 min. is talk, talk, talk--which is the easiest way of getting rid of the excess libido. But, you'll argue, the same can be said of many flicks; like say, Guns of Navarone. That's true--but people there had good reasons as they were using their libidos to try to win a war. The difference in Laura is, all here are blatantly showcasing their needs, while at the same time trying by all means to have a substitute which would allow them the release without having to go through the experience itself. At its core, Laura is a scathing portrait of how unfulfilling the sex life of this crowd was at that epoch, despite all the ritzy appearances. Here the main focus of sublimated lust of every Joe is Laura herself, the incredibly beautiful yet sexually neutral, anodyne goddess to fantasize about but who'll turn into ashes--or stone?-as soon as you touch her.(this is not meant to be a criticism of Tierney, truly, but if she was such a hot ticket then is because her aseptic beauty fitted best the tastes and conventions of those puritanical, pre--Marilyn times in Hollywood). And of course women will fantasize about men they can't have. At the end the only real crime committed here is having them all licking their chops while not getting any. (BTW, in the original script Laura really died, which means McPherson fell in love with her portrait, following the norm). Now, about the technical aspect, the package, the cinematography, I'm not the first one to say it: Laura is all about style, about beautiful people in beautiful clothes parading in elegant surroundings, drinking champagne and carrying on their beautiful conversations. Speaking of which, I've never seen a flick with more contrived, unnatural, lines of dialog. I was checking all along and I could barely find any case in which a character was taken off guard by someone else's remark and had to pause, think, before giving an answer. It was just like a tennis match, snappy lines coming and going, as if the characters were all reading their lines which of course reveals the artificiality of the whole thing. As for Waldo I can't believe his insulting invectives could pass for witticism at any time, context, social milieu. Are they sure they consulted the right entry in Webster's? And man, does he sound like something is wrong with him. If someone came nowadays talking like that to a hotel desk they would make him lie down, give him some air and call a doctor. Where do they talk like that, in Mensa meetings, in the Save the Platypus organization?. And frankly I don't see this one as a noir. Rather as a flick that purposely started trying to be a noir only to lose its way going there and becoming entangled in a mess of assorted things: drama de moeurs (as the French say), faux--romance, crime thriller, social commentary. The only linking element being, as said, that the characters are not getting any. Noir characters need a least some depth, some dramatic reach, and these here are unbelievable in their shallowness and artificiality, more cardboard cuts than real people. Neither there's any atmosphere, no ambiance, no feel of impending doom. I didn't even feel for Laura when she was "arrested", as at that point I wasn't even looking at her as a real person, just as an image on a screen. Despite it all Laura is half-heartedly recommended, if only to know what the fuss is about. As a plus you have the typical Preminger direction, with his meticulous setting & framing of sceneswith his proverbial economy of shots, as we know--with his expert use of full bodied blacks along with resplendent whites. Most of the action unfolds in interiors, giving him the chance for indulging in luxurious surroundings--gorgeous sculptures, Ming vases, invaluable paintingsto the point that Laura's apartment looks like the ballroom of the Titanic. Or that was Waldo's bathroom...In any case, don't look for emotion, for sexual tension or for depth here. There's no one single relationship having any of that; they all look contrived, specially that of the leads. Just picture it: Laura sees as proof of the cop's love the fact that he arrests her for murder, so he can show her his feelings "in an more official setting". If that doesn't turn you away, then give it a try. 6.0/10.

    This is definitely one of the finest crime thrillers of its times. Otto Preminger was able to direct a movie that is gripping and very mysterious because of the storyline, and at the same time tremendously dialogue-oriented, because of its structure. He gave this noir movie a fine European touch, mainly due to the fact that there aren't any spectacular gun fights, chases or on-screen murders, but the emphasis is put on dialogues, which encourage one's imagination to produce vivid images of the crime. It's a tale of brutal murder, and huge obsession that lead to it. However, the unexpected turn, placed brilliantly somewhere in the middle of the movie, makes it even more suspenseful. The film makes a great use of various flashbacks to show the roots of this enormous obsession and jealousy coming from the side of Waldo Lydecker. Fine narrative voice-over that is somehow very similar to the one used later in Sunset Boulevard. It is supposed to set the mood and impose an intrigue that will satisfy the viewer and make him concentrated on every detail of the story. You can see the director's professionalism in every aspect of the film. For one, he makes a fascinating use of symbolism, and various elements that come with it (namely the two clocks), which ultimately lead to an important discovery, providing the horrifying explanation of this tough case. Dana Andrews is fantastic as a detective, who is serious about his job, but at the same time inescapably falls in love with the girl, whose murder he is investigating. He wants to show how tough and unemotional he can be when it comes to his line of work, but after some time the only thing he cares about is Laura and her safety. Talking about the titular girl: Gene Tierney is really appealing and convincing as pure, seemingly innocent and very amiable Laura. Her mesmerizing beauty makes it very easy to believe that every man falls in love with her right away and wants to have her only to himself. Clifton Webb is great as this really clever and wise writer, who with a little help of his huge intelligence and cunningness is able to convince everyone that he should be the least suspected person in the whole case. All in all, Laura is a very fine thriller with a properly developed plot and well-selected cast of characters. Everyone can be a suspect, just like in all the decent detective tale that you will find. But the somber atmosphere surrounding the story and incredible jealousy and obsessive behavior depicted in it provide for a noir title that everybody should see at least once.

    Laura Hunt is a young, beautiful, hugely successful New York advertising executive. Or rather she was those things. Because as this movie opens Laura is dead. Murdered, a shotgun blast to the face. So who was Laura really? What do we really know about her? Those are intriguing questions. But this movie's big question is of course who killed her? The mystery unfolds with a small handful of suspects and an at times rather peculiar investigation. Along the way we have some flashbacks to help establish who Laura was, how our suspects were connected to her, and why anyone could have possibly wanted to blow this seemingly innocent woman's head off. Because on the surface her murder makes very little sense. As you try to make some sense of it all the movie has some big surprises in store for you. Dana Andrews plays the role of detective Mark McPherson, who in the course of his investigation does some rather unusual things. Things which quite frankly no detective would ever actually do. But we will see he must do these things to move the movie's plot forward. Without this series of contrivances there would be no movie. Rather sloppy plotting it must be said but not so bad as to greatly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. One of McPherson's absurd actions is to allow one of his prime suspects to tag along for interrogations of his other prime suspects. A very contrived way to get all the key players in a room together. That prime suspect is newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker, the man responsible for making Laura who she was. Just ask him, he'll tell you. He loves talking about himself that's for sure. Clifton Webb plays this flamboyant, rather effeminate character. Waldo prances through the movie like a queen but it is apparent that he was quite in love with Laura. Which makes the fact that Laura was about to marry another man quite unacceptable in Waldo's eyes. The man Laura intended to marry is Shelby Carpenter, a not particularly intelligent country bumpkin who somehow finds himself moving in Manhattan's highest social circles. But did Laura really intend to marry Shelby? Waldo would have you believe she was reconsidering the marriage. If Shelby knew that he might certainly have a motive for the murder. Meanwhile Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell, has a thing for Shelby so maybe she wanted Laura out of the way. And Laura's maid also seemed to have an unusually strong affection for Laura. So there are the suspects. The movie then goes through a series of twists and turns, one of which is a real doozy, before all will finally be revealed. This is an intriguing movie but perhaps not quite as engrossing as it may have been. Even at less than ninety minutes the movie seems a bit slow and labored at times. The fact that some of the key story elements are scarcely believable doesn't help. Andrews does an OK job in playing the movie's detective but the fact that detective does so many frankly stupid things sometimes makes it hard to take the guy seriously. Webb floats through the movie on a cloud, chewing as much scenery as he can swallow. But his performance does make for a memorable character. The problem is that when you see Webb's 50-something Waldo with Gene Tierney's beautiful 20-something Laura the love story doesn't ring true. The oddest of odd couples. Then again while Laura had affection for Waldo she was after all intending to marry another man. So it's apparently unrequited love on Waldo's part. That other man, Shelby, is played by Vincent Price. It's not always easy playing a hapless dunce and that's pretty much what Shelby is. But Price does very well in the role. As the aunt and the maid Judith Anderson and Dorothy Adams respectively have less to do. They're pushed forward as possible suspects but the movie focuses most of its attention on Waldo and Shelby. Laura herself gets a little lost but Tierney certainly holds her own when she gets her opportunities. This is a movie which wants to keep you guessing but it doesn't always succeed in that. It certainly surprises you here and there but by the end there's a creeping sense of inevitability. Most in the audience will probably guess the murderer's identity before the movie's detective does. When we get to that ending we find it's just as contrived as much of what has preceded it. Instead of going out with a bang the movie fizzles out in what is slightly disappointing fashion. This isn't a bad murder mystery but it would be hard to call it a truly great one. It has its intriguing elements but the whole ends up being a little less than the sum of its parts.

    Provocative Mystery and Stylish Glamour; Glorious Portrait and Haunting Score

    A portrait, a painting, a piece of art have always played a decisive role in addressing our emotions and leading our thoughts to some 'idealized reality.' A beautiful woman in the painting has been a focus of interest...men admired her, women envied her; yet both have been affected by her glamor, mystery, detail and style. "A passion for the unavailable," as Petrarch once described the name Laura, is precisely what we encounter in this powerful film noir of the 1940s where one of the most beautiful actresses, Gene Tierney, at last decided to "play a painting." But is it only the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who makes this film one of the most aesthetic and fabulous screen productions? Is the widespread appreciation and applause dedicated only to her? All the merits of the film appear to focus on PORTRAIT, SCORE and ATMOSPHERE. These three aspects, as certain details, seem to create the harmony of the general conclusion after viewing LAURA. As a film noir (one of its very best manifestations), LAURA emphasizes the portrait of "a woman of mystery and glamor" (Gene Tierney)...an advertising executive whom we get to know with New York police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews). Just for curiosity, the portrait was initially painted by director Rouben Mamoulian's wife (first director of the movie) but...as a matter of fact, what we actually find in the movie is a blowup of Gene Tierney's photograph. The portrait leads us to the specific atmosphere of tension, suspicion, glamor, haunt, mystery and the unpredictable effects of murder investigation...the atmosphere at its best! This atmosphere is enriched by magnificent score, a unique work by David Raksin, a novelty at that time promoted by the composer for Fox studio Alfred Newman. His score supplies us with unforgettable feelings while watching the movie and helps the viewers keep interest and suspicion. It beautifully adapts detective elements, sexual references and a sentiment to the scenes. To enrich the atmosphere, we also need to add the flashbacks that play an important role in the movie and explain a lot in discovering the events as well as lead us to a certain reality and emotions. Also, the moody scenes with stunning cinematography add certain moods and resemblance. Another significant aspect of LAURA's artistry are, of course, the performances. Although there are practically not many characters in the movie, casting occurred to be pretty challenging. It is important to keep in mind that the author of the novel, Vera Caspary, badly wanted a screen adaptation but had her word in many decisions, including the portrayals of characters. After the long and tedious process of casting (even Marlene Dietrich was willing to play the lead), the results are fabulous. Gene Tierney portrays a sophisticated woman of the high society, no naive woman, no femme fatale but a strong woman who gets balanced among three men our attention is called upon: the newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) whose vicious charm shapes her decisions and who has, indeed, the strongest power in her life; her fianc&eacute; Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a gentle man who "would not even kill a fly" and the police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) who suspects no one and everyone at the same time. In between the men comes her wealthy aunt, Ann Treadwell memorably portrayed by the highly respected actress whose career illumined both the stage and cinema, Judith Anderson. However, let me consider the male performances in more details. Dana Andrews does a brilliant job as the detective making us not only the observers of the investigation but, thanks to the powerful and effective depiction of indefatigable determination, he lets us into his world where women are 'dames' and where suspicions are daily bread. The most unforgettable scene is when he enters Laura's apartment and the emphasis on details, the dream-like tension and his instantaneous movements occur to be the clarity with no words. Clifton Webb, who portrays the most difficult character, in fact, excellently combines the wretchedness with sympathy, doubt with certainty. He is not a villain and he does not look to be one... He is a man of power, a man of talent, a man of self esteem and mannerisms. He even becomes respectable, even in the eyes of the most suspicious viewers until... Vincent Price has his moments in the film, he is vibrant and genuine in the role; a young and inexperienced in man-woman relation? A little but shy? It occurs quite meaningful to state that both Clifton Webb and Vincent Price started their careers from supporting roles and then became legendary. However, there is yet another legendary name in LAURA that makes this film stand out as a historic production...that is the "tireless" (according to Gene Tierney) director Otto Preminger. Vincent Price memorably stated: "Otto Preminger had an implicit knowledge of pseudo-sophisticated world" and supplied the characters with the 'sense of evil' not making anyone villains. Preminger's great achievement is the fact that he managed to combine a detective story with psychology. His direction makes the film both sophisticated and romantic...I don't doubt that Rouben Mamoulian with his exquisite talents would also have managed that stylish element (he proved that in DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE)...yet, some of his requirements occurred to be of little use for the crew and the author herself. LAURA is a great atmospheric film noir, a provocative mystery combined with the stylish glamor where the haunting score leads us to the glorious portrait of female charm and mystery. 9/10

    Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) has been murdered, and as New York City Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigates, he finds that everyone seems to be in love with her -- and he, too, gradually falls under her spell. But things aren't always what they seem. Darryl F. Zanuck was opposed to casting Clifton Webb because of his known homosexuality, but Preminger prevailed and the 54-year-old Webb, making his first screen appearance since the silent era, was nominated for an Oscar. Webb really does sell the film, with lines like, "Will you stop calling her a dame? Does this look like the home of a dame? Have you ever known a woman who wasn't a doll or a dame?" Great dignified actor. And speaking of dignified, you have Vincent Price, young and without any facial hair, even before his voice achieved its full distinctiveness. Interestingly, he comes off as a wimp here and seems to go back and forth between stage and screen style acting. (Price always had a very stage quality to his film roles.) Does this film have a connection to "Twin Peaks"? A girl named Laura, murdered, with everyone attracted to her? I do not know... there is no direct connection, but it came to my mind.

    This movie reminds me of Casablanca in that it SHOULD have been just a run-of-the- mill noirish potboiler, but it ends up being so much more than that, thanks to a happy confluence of talents. Just as Bogart and Bergman, with the help of Claude Rains, raise Casablanca to sublimity, so too do Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney raise this material with the considerable help of Clifton Webb. The performances (Vincent Price and Judith Anderson in SUPPORTING roles!?!) mesh together like gears in a Rolex, and it's a pleasure to behold. I know it's been said before, but Gene Tierney's amazing looks make one believe that a detective could fall in love with her portrait. This movie is a superlative exemplar of its genre, and anyone who is a fan of that genre should do themselves a favor and see this film immediately.
