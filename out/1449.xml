    For twenty whole years of my life I lived in ignorance without having seen the sun or the moon but today I have finally seen the Ray and I feel holy and blessed now. Akira Kurusawa, the man behind Japanese classics like Rashomon and Ran rightly said years ago that living in a world without having seen a Satyajit Ray film is similar to living without having seen the sun or moon; almost every film I've watched feels effete after living in Ray's world. It is a transcending experience watching the late Bengali director's debut effort Pather Panchali, one that deeply impacts the very core of your soul in a way that makes you feel afterwards as though you've lived two lives  one before having watched Pather Panchali and one after. It achieves the remarkable feat of invoking your senses to a higher state of consciousness; the experience watching Pather Panchali is similar to reading Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace or some of William Blake's or Emily Dickinson's finest achievements, or watching Meryl Streep's iconic turn as Sophie Zawistowski in Sophie's Choice. The feeling is so powerful that it took me more than an hour to get back to my original state; the hardest part for me was to return the DVD to the movie rental store because I knew the true worth of what I was holding. May god bless the guy who recognized Pather Panchali's worth years ago and preserved the original prints so the world today can have a chance to be transported to the precious little magical world of Apu, the film's protagonist. This little world is black and white to the outer eye, but the film is so richly filmed and composed that it colors our mind with the most exquisite palette. The opening credits, which wouldn't be understood by anyone who can't read Bengali, still captures the spirit of Pather Panchali though Ravi Shankar's playful, whimsical and yearning tabla beats and sitar strums; only Michael Danna could hypnotize us in 2012's Life of Pi with a similarly evocative score. Ray's world opens not with Apu or his sister Durga but with the film's most antagonistic character, the rancorous neighbor of Apu's family who's worshipping the tulsi plant early in the morning. Satyajit follows her as she notices Durga, the still-unborn Apu's sister, stealing fruits from her courtyard. Durga runs along the woods to her shanty home and hands the fruits to her senescent grandaunt Indir Thakrun after keeping milk for her three little cats. Ray then cuts back to the nagging neighbor who is berating Durga and cursing her family for raising a thief; in an excellently composed sequence, Ray is able to seamlessly capture her, the lady listening in the next house balcony listening to her and Durga's pregnant mother Sarbajaya and her empathic friend collecting water from the well behind the neighbor's house, well within earshot of the woman's bitter rant. Sarbajaya confronts her daughter for stealing fruits and then berates Indir Thakrun for encouraging Durga's bad behavior. Indir Thakrun leaves the house temporarily, frustrated by Sarbajaya's nagging, but returns soon as Sarbajaya gives birth to Apu. A couple of dissolves then takes us some years ahead and we see Apu now as an innocent school-going kid who's most fond of his sister Durga. His family is barely able to fulfill their basic needs, with Apu's soft- mannered father Harihar Roy being too lax about asking his dues from his employer; he is neither able to make much as a playwright. This situation makes it especially tough for Sarbajaya to manage the household needs as she herself doesn't like begging others for monetary or any other help; she therefore is all the more harsh on Indir Thakrun, who sometimes like Durga is wont to taking food items from Sarbajaya's kitchen without permission. There are two sequences at different points in the film which include Harihar and Sarbajaya; both retain the same posture in the sequences but while in the first sequence, Harihar gives a more optimistic image to Sarbajaya to pacify her, in the second he sounds less enthusiastic while Sarbajaya looks more worried for their future. Apu is still too young to be affected by the family problems and we only see him enjoying his childhood days with Durga and his friends. Durga is extremely supportive of everybody including her mother, who reacts violently towards Durga when same neighbor in the beginning accuses Durga of stealing her daughter's beaded necklace. The family's problems persist after Harihar travels to nearby city to find work and tragedies strike one after the other; the family's only hope, as told by Harihar in his letters to Sarbajaya after leaving, is to leave everything to God's Grace keeping in mind that everything happens for the better. To Satyajit Ray, every image and every sound, both on-screen and off- screen matter. It's his craftsmanship as a movie visionary that segues the film so well that you are bemused to hear that it's his debut film. I've read one of his books, a compilation of his essays and theories on film, and he mentions how his inexperienced crew hadn't even operated a camera before filming Pather Panchali and so the first half was a little choppy in editing. I don't have any clue what he's talking here because to my eyes, every image was seamlessly stitched together. To me he didn't capture images but rather created images on film; it's difficult to express just how wonderfully he captures Sarbajaya's gradual breakdown in the film without using superlatives. And his genius picture is complemented by Ravi Shankar's background score, which includes sound of bells that ring during a cheerful sequence with a candy man and also during some of the haunting moments; it reminded me of Edgar Allan Poe's brilliant poem The Bells. Pather Panchali is scintillating, and Satyajit is the Ray of Light.

    In 1956, "Pather panchali" opened to the least possible fanfare at the Cannes Film Festival. It was shown at midnight the same time there was a party in honor of Akira Kurosawa, and only a handful of film critics bothered to attend the screening. We can be thankful for the ones who did, among them Bazin, Moskowitz and Anderson. They demanded the film be shown again, and the rest is history. I paraphrase from the essay "Distant Music" written by Philip Kemp, available in the booklet for "Jalsaghar" ('The Music Room', 1958), released by the Criterion Collection. Ray is absolutely amazing. "Charulata" (1964) was my first love, after which I was able to see this and then "Jalsaghar". Now I've been going through his select filmography, and I'm going to have to visit Charu again in the near future. Just like "Jalsaghar", the three films that are the Apu trilogy are an overwhelmingly sober account of life and death, and everything in between. Each film is structured around death, and normally we would have reconciliation. But here we have perceived reconciliation through death, "perceived" in the sense that each time it's short of complete; something is left unsaid, something is amiss. It's all quite shocking, really. Emotionally very draining, and this is Ray's absolute gift. He is able to touch upon a subject like this and examine it whilst retaining a sense of vitality, allowing him not to succumb to heavy-handed melancholy (something I feel Bergman occasionally swerved to) but instead stay rooted in life &nbsp;bittersweet, full of hope, sometimes unanswered. There are some iconic and haunting images in this film that are yet to be matched in their intensity. A beautiful death poem, and a life poem, as well.

    'Pather Panchali', the first one in Satyajit Ray's 'The Apu Trilogy', is a cinematic masterpiece, and the best one in the trilogy. The story, the characters, the situations, everything in this movie overflows with such excruciating reality and brilliance. It well-deservedly won the 'Best Human Document Award' at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. No matter how old and slow the movie is, it's captivating and extremely absorbing from the very beginning, and shows the heights a film, at its best, is capable of achieving. It stands out because of its poetry, its humanity, its haunting lyric beauty, its imagery, and its remarkable portrayal of a family and a culture. Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's impressive screenplay, along with Satyajit Ray's exceptional direction, portrayed through powerful performances by every actor in the movie, makes it the film that it is. Ray's direction is top-notch and one-of-a-kind. The characters, their hopes and dreams, their behaviour and relationships - everything is shown with such brutal realism, relatability and poignancy. I was really able to empathize, and feel the angst and pain of the characters. And if this is not enough, imagine this was Ray's debut movie, and made on a budget that wouldn't buy a five-star meal these days! The movie proves why Satyajit Ray is referred to as the Grand Master of World Cinema. This first part in the trilogy takes you through the starting years of Apu's childhood when he was living in his ancestral home in Bengal, with his parents and sister. The dual themes of progress and loss form the core of this film, as well as the whole trilogy. On a personal note, this is the best film I've ever seen which explores childhood so stunningly. The movie's places, characters and every other thing reminded me of something from my childhood; it was nostalgic and heart-wrenchingly beautiful. There are so many scenes of the siblings which remind wondrous events from one's childhood: the pursuit of a sweet-seller, running across white fields to catch a glimpse of a moving train, a simple picnic among friends in the forest, playfully getting wet in rain, and hiding some evidence so that the other sibling doesn't into trouble. Even the range of intriguing characters in the film is vast; the hardworking but seldom-present father, the overburdened mother, the innocent siblings exploring the world around them, the always complaining or blaming neighbour/landlord, and the old and usually silent old lady in the neighbourhood who's always in her own world. Even at this age, the Trilogy is considered to be one of the most important and brilliant pieces of Cinematic History. Legendary Japanese Filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once aptly said: "Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon."

    Watching the film, Pather Panchali (Song of the Little Road) directed by Satyajit Ray, you would have thought that Ray was a season veteran director, but in truth, it's his debut work about the life of a family in Bengal living in poverty. Based on the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, when Ray started this film, I think Ray had literally never held a movie camera. I understand that Italian neo-realist films had a big influence on him; all to the better. There are a number of key scenes shot in the film that beholds the beauty and emotional depth in itself. The film never had a complete script; it was made from Ray's drawings and notes. Ray tried to extract and build a simple theme out of the apparently random sequences of significants. Some notable shifts from the novel in the script include the death scenes of key characters, one which occurs quite early in the novel in a village shrine at the presence of some adult members of the family; in the film that key character dies in the open in the presence of the family children, Apu and Durga. The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of the train is not there in the novel, neither child manages to see the train there, although they made an attempt. That scene alone is well played. Such a beautiful scene. I love the sounds of the wind and the hum of the electricity, and the slow, fading edits. It captures perfectly the landscape and the young child's curiosity. The train shows the changes happening in India, and we know the children will grow into a world that is different to their parents. They are left gazing at a thin veil of smoke as the sound of the wind returns. It is very moving. Camera work as usual in Satyajit Ray's film is always brilliant as it has used lot of drifting tracking shot. There almost cosmic emotional power in some other scenes, such as the sunset with Apu and that of the monsoon. The scene from when the snake creeps into an abandoned 'house of sorrows' to their stunned faces on the ox cart was a unforgettable Ravi Shankar theme. I think it foreshadows death. Apu & sister Durga share an intimate bond, they exploring their little world and sharing secrets are the most remarkable aspect of this film. The language might be foreign to me but the emotions were completely native. The film took three years to complete the shooting, and it's was just lucky it got finished with little to no money to product. Pather Panchali was followed by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life 'Aparajito' (The Unvanquished) in 1956 & Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. The only faults I can find in this film is that it's insanely depressing. The movie has a lot of death, and nothing really get any better for the family as the film goes on. There is no happy ever after, as this isn't Slumdog Millionaire. The movie is hard to find, and if found, it's rarely in English subtitles and the video transfer is horrible, the sound transfer only marginally better. Another factor is the disconnection by scene to scene, and gives an all-inclusive quality to the film; yet it is also distracting and contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention as the film pace is slow. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through. It's run time is 122 mins, and there are long periods of time of nothing going on. One can stare in dull amaze for only so long looking at nature. The first half is nearer to social realism, setting out the social hierarchies, introducing characters and their social or family role, defining them against other people, their home and nature. The second half of the film, however, becomes more abstract, even mystical. There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action. Film is still better than 2 most of today's loud, flashy torture bollywood movies. This film is true art.

    Satyajit Ray's debut! A masterpiece. Why? Because it makes you cry. It will make you pull your emotions out. It will do what no other film can do: introspect! Pather Panchali depicts the life and times of a poverty-stricken family, the way the lead lady copes with her life, her kin and her children. The fascination of the kids to see the train pass by, the young girl's eagerness to get married as her friends start settling with their spouses, the little boy's (Apu's) innocent activities will all make you think, think and think. This is not just cinema, this is a wonderful epitome on which we all must try to rely as we continue to lead our lived without meaning. Pather Panchali is EPIC! If you are looking for serious cinema or not, you gotta watch this before you die! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: No Sex: No Mouth-Kiss: No Violence: No Nudity: Women do not wear upper underthings.

    There are movies that you watch and forget even if they were good and then there are some that linger on for some strange reason. This, as expected, was one of those very few. The technical quality can be discounted completely as it was made in the '50s and on a shoestring budget but, what really stands out, is the quality of the content per every minute that the film rolls.... Unbelievable!!! The message that is conveyed is universal and the subtlety is remarkable. I am not saying this because I am from India but for the fact that Ray was as brilliant universally as Bergman and the likes. Watch it with an open mind and you will not be disappointed.

    The film is a true example of presenting the humanity. The film is about a poor Bengali family who is struggling to make their ends meet. Their wishes are very simple and true to the situation. The two children are amazing. First Durga mesmerizes you with her looks and her running styles and then comes Apu, whose eyes say everything. The one who steals the show is the mother of children. Circles around her eyes always say a lot more than she wants to represent. Their father also performs the role very nicely. I was very happy to see the acting. The soundtrack although not too much engaging, at times gives a strange nice feeling. The story is no doubt good but what makes this film more fascinating than it might have been in the book is the ability of a great maestro (Satyajit Ray) to represent them with so profound emotion. The outcome after the difficulties he had faced during the making is truly a treat to watch. MESSAGE: "Life goes on." VERDICT: "A must watch for all cine lovers."

    Pather Panchali marked the introduction of Satyajit Ray, arguably India's finest filmmaker. Pather Panchali, based on Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's identically titled novel, is the story of a small family in a rural Indian setting. Pather Panchali is the first film of the "Apu Trilogy", the three Ray films chronicling the life of Apu, a village boy, over the years. The film bears signs of what would make Ray a renowned name in world cinema in the years to follow. The immensely faithful portrayal of the life of the primary characters, complete with their hopes, dreams, petty troubles and idiosyncrasies, resonated deeply with the psyche of the Indian audience.

    This is one of those movies that, as a lover of film, I felt obliged to watch because of its status in film history rather than any real burning desire on my part. That's what is so wonderful about cinema - it can surprise and beguile you when you least expect it. Pather Panchali, although steeped in Indian culture, tells a universal story of the human condition. Apu is the only son of an impoverished family whose father must leave home for months in order to find work. While he is gone life grows even harder for his wife and two children, Apu and his older sister Durga. Pather Panchali won't appeal to all tastes. It's nothing like the ultra-colourful Bollywood output we're all familiar with to some degree today. No songs or dances, for a start. Instead, it is a measured, contemplative reflection on the beauty that can be found in the world regardless of the hardship of life. Subrata Mitra's reflective camera dwells on something as mundane as gnats skimming across water, for example, and by forcing the viewer's attention in the desired direction, somehow turns them into things of beauty. Similarly, the close relationship between Apu and his ill-fated sister, while as understated as the rest of the film, is both heart-warming and devastating. Definitely one to catch if you can - even if it doesn't really appeal at first glance.

    A deeply emotional story exploring human nature (particularly its weakness), family ties/disconnections and karma which is really well told despite being slow and meandering at times. Black and white definitely adds something to the film. One of the best things about this film is that the interpretation is left up to you - just like life. I get the feeling my empathy will change from one character to another depending on my viewpoint of life. On this occasion I focused on the mother, her isolation, susceptibility to the opinions of others and how this distorted and transformed her intense love for her family into something wicked and ugly. I have huge admiration for the character insight provided by the director always shying away from telling the audience what to think or how to interpret it. Still puzzled by the long scene showing dragonflies and lilies on the pond. It was waaaaaaaay too long. Also the religious references were lost on me.

He is able to touch upon a subject like this and examine it whilst retaining a sense of vitality, allowing him not to succumb to heavy-handed melancholy (something I feel Bergman occasionally swerved to) but instead stay rooted in life &nbsp;bittersweet, full of hope, sometimes unanswered. There are some iconic and haunting images in this film that are yet to be matched in their intensity. A beautiful death poem, and a life poem, as well.

    'Pather Panchali', the first one in Satyajit Ray's 'The Apu Trilogy', is a cinematic masterpiece, and the best one in the trilogy. The story, the characters, the situations, everything in this movie overflows with such excruciating reality and brilliance. It well-deservedly won the 'Best Human Document Award' at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. No matter how old and slow the movie is, it's captivating and extremely absorbing from the very beginning, and shows the heights a film, at its best, is capable of achieving. It stands out because of its poetry, its humanity, its haunting lyric beauty, its imagery, and its remarkable portrayal of a family and a culture. Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's impressive screenplay, along with Satyajit Ray's exceptional direction, portrayed through powerful performances by every actor in the movie, makes it the film that it is. Ray's direction is top-notch and one-of-a-kind. The characters, their hopes and dreams, their behaviour and relationships - everything is shown with such brutal realism, relatability and poignancy. I was really able to empathize, and feel the angst and pain of the characters. And if this is not enough, imagine this was Ray's debut movie, and made on a budget that wouldn't buy a five-star meal these days! The movie proves why Satyajit Ray is referred to as the Grand Master of World Cinema. This first part in the trilogy takes you through the starting years of Apu's childhood when he was living in his ancestral home in Bengal, with his parents and sister. The dual themes of progress and loss form the core of this film, as well as the whole trilogy. On a personal note, this is the best film I've ever seen which explores childhood so stunningly. The movie's places, characters and every other thing reminded me of something from my childhood; it was nostalgic and heart-wrenchingly beautiful. There are so many scenes of the siblings which remind wondrous events from one's childhood: the pursuit of a sweet-seller, running across white fields to catch a glimpse of a moving train, a simple picnic among friends in the forest, playfully getting wet in rain, and hiding some evidence so that the other sibling doesn't into trouble. Even the range of intriguing characters in the film is vast; the hardworking but seldom-present father, the overburdened mother, the innocent siblings exploring the world around them, the always complaining or blaming neighbour/landlord, and the old and usually silent old lady in the neighbourhood who's always in her own world. Even at this age, the Trilogy is considered to be one of the most important and brilliant pieces of Cinematic History. Legendary Japanese Filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once aptly said: "Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon."

    Watching the film, Pather Panchali (Song of the Little Road) directed by Satyajit Ray, you would have thought that Ray was a season veteran director, but in truth, it's his debut work about the life of a family in Bengal living in poverty. Based on the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, when Ray started this film, I think Ray had literally never held a movie camera. I understand that Italian neo-realist films had a big influence on him; all to the better. There are a number of key scenes shot in the film that beholds the beauty and emotional depth in itself. The film never had a complete script; it was made from Ray's drawings and notes. Ray tried to extract and build a simple theme out of the apparently random sequences of significants. Some notable shifts from the novel in the script include the death scenes of key characters, one which occurs quite early in the novel in a village shrine at the presence of some adult members of the family; in the film that key character dies in the open in the presence of the family children, Apu and Durga. The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of the train is not there in the novel, neither child manages to see the train there, although they made an attempt. That scene alone is well played. Such a beautiful scene. I love the sounds of the wind and the hum of the electricity, and the slow, fading edits. It captures perfectly the landscape and the young child's curiosity. The train shows the changes happening in India, and we know the children will grow into a world that is different to their parents. They are left gazing at a thin veil of smoke as the sound of the wind returns. It is very moving. Camera work as usual in Satyajit Ray's film is always brilliant as it has used lot of drifting tracking shot. There almost cosmic emotional power in some other scenes, such as the sunset with Apu and that of the monsoon. The scene from when the snake creeps into an abandoned 'house of sorrows' to their stunned faces on the ox cart was a unforgettable Ravi Shankar theme. I think it foreshadows death. Apu & sister Durga share an intimate bond, they exploring their little world and sharing secrets are the most remarkable aspect of this film. The language might be foreign to me but the emotions were completely native. The film took three years to complete the shooting, and it's was just lucky it got finished with little to no money to product. Pather Panchali was followed by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life 'Aparajito' (The Unvanquished) in 1956 & Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. The only faults I can find in this film is that it's insanely depressing. The movie has a lot of death, and nothing really get any better for the family as the film goes on. There is no happy ever after, as this isn't Slumdog Millionaire. The movie is hard to find, and if found, it's rarely in English subtitles and the video transfer is horrible, the sound transfer only marginally better. Another factor is the disconnection by scene to scene, and gives an all-inclusive quality to the film; yet it is also distracting and contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention as the film pace is slow. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through. It's run time is 122 mins, and there are long periods of time of nothing going on. One can stare in dull amaze for only so long looking at nature. The first half is nearer to social realism, setting out the social hierarchies, introducing characters and their social or family role, defining them against other people, their home and nature. The second half of the film, however, becomes more abstract, even mystical. There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action. Film is still better than 2 most of today's loud, flashy torture bollywood movies. This film is true art.

    Satyajit Ray's debut! A masterpiece. Why? Because it makes you cry. It will make you pull your emotions out. It will do what no other film can do: introspect! Pather Panchali depicts the life and times of a poverty-stricken family, the way the lead lady copes with her life, her kin and her children. The fascination of the kids to see the train pass by, the young girl's eagerness to get married as her friends start settling with their spouses, the little boy's (Apu's) innocent activities will all make you think, think and think. This is not just cinema, this is a wonderful epitome on which we all must try to rely as we continue to lead our lived without meaning. Pather Panchali is EPIC! If you are looking for serious cinema or not, you gotta watch this before you die! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: No Sex: No Mouth-Kiss: No Violence: No Nudity: Women do not wear upper underthings.

    There are movies that you watch and forget even if they were good and then there are some that linger on for some strange reason. This, as expected, was one of those very few. The technical quality can be discounted completely as it was made in the '50s and on a shoestring budget but, what really stands out, is the quality of the content per every minute that the film rolls.... Unbelievable!!! The message that is conveyed is universal and the subtlety is remarkable. I am not saying this because I am from India but for the fact that Ray was as brilliant universally as Bergman and the likes. Watch it with an open mind and you will not be disappointed.

    The film is a true example of presenting the humanity. The film is about a poor Bengali family who is struggling to make their ends meet. Their wishes are very simple and true to the situation. The two children are amazing. First Durga mesmerizes you with her looks and her running styles and then comes Apu, whose eyes say everything. The one who steals the show is the mother of children. Circles around her eyes always say a lot more than she wants to represent. Their father also performs the role very nicely. I was very happy to see the acting. The soundtrack although not too much engaging, at times gives a strange nice feeling. The story is no doubt good but what makes this film more fascinating than it might have been in the book is the ability of a great maestro (Satyajit Ray) to represent them with so profound emotion. The outcome after the difficulties he had faced during the making is truly a treat to watch. MESSAGE: "Life goes on." VERDICT: "A must watch for all cine lovers."

    Pather Panchali marked the introduction of Satyajit Ray, arguably India's finest filmmaker. Pather Panchali, based on Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's identically titled novel, is the story of a small family in a rural Indian setting. Pather Panchali is the first film of the "Apu Trilogy", the three Ray films chronicling the life of Apu, a village boy, over the years. The film bears signs of what would make Ray a renowned name in world cinema in the years to follow. The immensely faithful portrayal of the life of the primary characters, complete with their hopes, dreams, petty troubles and idiosyncrasies, resonated deeply with the psyche of the Indian audience.

    This is one of those movies that, as a lover of film, I felt obliged to watch because of its status in film history rather than any real burning desire on my part. That's what is so wonderful about cinema - it can surprise and beguile you when you least expect it. Pather Panchali, although steeped in Indian culture, tells a universal story of the human condition. Apu is the only son of an impoverished family whose father must leave home for months in order to find work. While he is gone life grows even harder for his wife and two children, Apu and his older sister Durga. Pather Panchali won't appeal to all tastes. It's nothing like the ultra-colourful Bollywood output we're all familiar with to some degree today. No songs or dances, for a start. Instead, it is a measured, contemplative reflection on the beauty that can be found in the world regardless of the hardship of life. Subrata Mitra's reflective camera dwells on something as mundane as gnats skimming across water, for example, and by forcing the viewer's attention in the desired direction, somehow turns them into things of beauty. Similarly, the close relationship between Apu and his ill-fated sister, while as understated as the rest of the film, is both heart-warming and devastating. Definitely one to catch if you can - even if it doesn't really appeal at first glance.

    A deeply emotional story exploring human nature (particularly its weakness), family ties/disconnections and karma which is really well told despite being slow and meandering at times. Black and white definitely adds something to the film. One of the best things about this film is that the interpretation is left up to you - just like life. I get the feeling my empathy will change from one character to another depending on my viewpoint of life. On this occasion I focused on the mother, her isolation, susceptibility to the opinions of others and how this distorted and transformed her intense love for her family into something wicked and ugly. I have huge admiration for the character insight provided by the director always shying away from telling the audience what to think or how to interpret it. Still puzzled by the long scene showing dragonflies and lilies on the pond. It was waaaaaaaay too long. Also the religious references were lost on me.

    For twenty whole years of my life I lived in ignorance without having seen the sun or the moon but today I have finally seen the Ray and I feel holy and blessed now. Akira Kurusawa, the man behind Japanese classics like Rashomon and Ran rightly said years ago that living in a world without having seen a Satyajit Ray film is similar to living without having seen the sun or moon; almost every film I've watched feels effete after living in Ray's world. It is a transcending experience watching the late Bengali director's debut effort Pather Panchali, one that deeply impacts the very core of your soul in a way that makes you feel afterwards as though you've lived two lives  one before having watched Pather Panchali and one after. It achieves the remarkable feat of invoking your senses to a higher state of consciousness; the experience watching Pather Panchali is similar to reading Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace or some of William Blake's or Emily Dickinson's finest achievements, or watching Meryl Streep's iconic turn as Sophie Zawistowski in Sophie's Choice. The feeling is so powerful that it took me more than an hour to get back to my original state; the hardest part for me was to return the DVD to the movie rental store because I knew the true worth of what I was holding. May god bless the guy who recognized Pather Panchali's worth years ago and preserved the original prints so the world today can have a chance to be transported to the precious little magical world of Apu, the film's protagonist. This little world is black and white to the outer eye, but the film is so richly filmed and composed that it colors our mind with the most exquisite palette. The opening credits, which wouldn't be understood by anyone who can't read Bengali, still captures the spirit of Pather Panchali though Ravi Shankar's playful, whimsical and yearning tabla beats and sitar strums; only Michael Danna could hypnotize us in 2012's Life of Pi with a similarly evocative score. Ray's world opens not with Apu or his sister Durga but with the film's most antagonistic character, the rancorous neighbor of Apu's family who's worshipping the tulsi plant early in the morning. Satyajit follows her as she notices Durga, the still-unborn Apu's sister, stealing fruits from her courtyard. Durga runs along the woods to her shanty home and hands the fruits to her senescent grandaunt Indir Thakrun after keeping milk for her three little cats. Ray then cuts back to the nagging neighbor who is berating Durga and cursing her family for raising a thief; in an excellently composed sequence, Ray is able to seamlessly capture her, the lady listening in the next house balcony listening to her and Durga's pregnant mother Sarbajaya and her empathic friend collecting water from the well behind the neighbor's house, well within earshot of the woman's bitter rant. Sarbajaya confronts her daughter for stealing fruits and then berates Indir Thakrun for encouraging Durga's bad behavior. Indir Thakrun leaves the house temporarily, frustrated by Sarbajaya's nagging, but returns soon as Sarbajaya gives birth to Apu. A couple of dissolves then takes us some years ahead and we see Apu now as an innocent school-going kid who's most fond of his sister Durga. His family is barely able to fulfill their basic needs, with Apu's soft- mannered father Harihar Roy being too lax about asking his dues from his employer; he is neither able to make much as a playwright. This situation makes it especially tough for Sarbajaya to manage the household needs as she herself doesn't like begging others for monetary or any other help; she therefore is all the more harsh on Indir Thakrun, who sometimes like Durga is wont to taking food items from Sarbajaya's kitchen without permission. There are two sequences at different points in the film which include Harihar and Sarbajaya; both retain the same posture in the sequences but while in the first sequence, Harihar gives a more optimistic image to Sarbajaya to pacify her, in the second he sounds less enthusiastic while Sarbajaya looks more worried for their future. Apu is still too young to be affected by the family problems and we only see him enjoying his childhood days with Durga and his friends. Durga is extremely supportive of everybody including her mother, who reacts violently towards Durga when same neighbor in the beginning accuses Durga of stealing her daughter's beaded necklace. The family's problems persist after Harihar travels to nearby city to find work and tragedies strike one after the other; the family's only hope, as told by Harihar in his letters to Sarbajaya after leaving, is to leave everything to God's Grace keeping in mind that everything happens for the better. To Satyajit Ray, every image and every sound, both on-screen and off- screen matter. It's his craftsmanship as a movie visionary that segues the film so well that you are bemused to hear that it's his debut film. I've read one of his books, a compilation of his essays and theories on film, and he mentions how his inexperienced crew hadn't even operated a camera before filming Pather Panchali and so the first half was a little choppy in editing. I don't have any clue what he's talking here because to my eyes, every image was seamlessly stitched together. To me he didn't capture images but rather created images on film; it's difficult to express just how wonderfully he captures Sarbajaya's gradual breakdown in the film without using superlatives. And his genius picture is complemented by Ravi Shankar's background score, which includes sound of bells that ring during a cheerful sequence with a candy man and also during some of the haunting moments; it reminded me of Edgar Allan Poe's brilliant poem The Bells. Pather Panchali is scintillating, and Satyajit is the Ray of Light.

    In 1956, "Pather panchali" opened to the least possible fanfare at the Cannes Film Festival. It was shown at midnight the same time there was a party in honor of Akira Kurosawa, and only a handful of film critics bothered to attend the screening. We can be thankful for the ones who did, among them Bazin, Moskowitz and Anderson. They demanded the film be shown again, and the rest is history. I paraphrase from the essay "Distant Music" written by Philip Kemp, available in the booklet for "Jalsaghar" ('The Music Room', 1958), released by the Criterion Collection. Ray is absolutely amazing. "Charulata" (1964) was my first love, after which I was able to see this and then "Jalsaghar". Now I've been going through his select filmography, and I'm going to have to visit Charu again in the near future. Just like "Jalsaghar", the three films that are the Apu trilogy are an overwhelmingly sober account of life and death, and everything in between. Each film is structured around death, and normally we would have reconciliation. But here we have perceived reconciliation through death, "perceived" in the sense that each time it's short of complete; something is left unsaid, something is amiss. It's all quite shocking, really. Emotionally very draining, and this is Ray's absolute gift. He is able to touch upon a subject like this and examine it whilst retaining a sense of vitality, allowing him not to succumb to heavy-handed melancholy (something I feel Bergman occasionally swerved to) but instead stay rooted in life &nbsp;bittersweet, full of hope, sometimes unanswered. There are some iconic and haunting images in this film that are yet to be matched in their intensity. A beautiful death poem, and a life poem, as well.

I am not saying this because I am from India but for the fact that Ray was as brilliant universally as Bergman and the likes. Watch it with an open mind and you will not be disappointed.

    The film is a true example of presenting the humanity. The film is about a poor Bengali family who is struggling to make their ends meet. Their wishes are very simple and true to the situation. The two children are amazing. First Durga mesmerizes you with her looks and her running styles and then comes Apu, whose eyes say everything. The one who steals the show is the mother of children. Circles around her eyes always say a lot more than she wants to represent. Their father also performs the role very nicely. I was very happy to see the acting. The soundtrack although not too much engaging, at times gives a strange nice feeling. The story is no doubt good but what makes this film more fascinating than it might have been in the book is the ability of a great maestro (Satyajit Ray) to represent them with so profound emotion. The outcome after the difficulties he had faced during the making is truly a treat to watch. MESSAGE: "Life goes on." VERDICT: "A must watch for all cine lovers."

    Pather Panchali marked the introduction of Satyajit Ray, arguably India's finest filmmaker. Pather Panchali, based on Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's identically titled novel, is the story of a small family in a rural Indian setting. Pather Panchali is the first film of the "Apu Trilogy", the three Ray films chronicling the life of Apu, a village boy, over the years. The film bears signs of what would make Ray a renowned name in world cinema in the years to follow. The immensely faithful portrayal of the life of the primary characters, complete with their hopes, dreams, petty troubles and idiosyncrasies, resonated deeply with the psyche of the Indian audience.

    This is one of those movies that, as a lover of film, I felt obliged to watch because of its status in film history rather than any real burning desire on my part. That's what is so wonderful about cinema - it can surprise and beguile you when you least expect it. Pather Panchali, although steeped in Indian culture, tells a universal story of the human condition. Apu is the only son of an impoverished family whose father must leave home for months in order to find work. While he is gone life grows even harder for his wife and two children, Apu and his older sister Durga. Pather Panchali won't appeal to all tastes. It's nothing like the ultra-colourful Bollywood output we're all familiar with to some degree today. No songs or dances, for a start. Instead, it is a measured, contemplative reflection on the beauty that can be found in the world regardless of the hardship of life. Subrata Mitra's reflective camera dwells on something as mundane as gnats skimming across water, for example, and by forcing the viewer's attention in the desired direction, somehow turns them into things of beauty. Similarly, the close relationship between Apu and his ill-fated sister, while as understated as the rest of the film, is both heart-warming and devastating. Definitely one to catch if you can - even if it doesn't really appeal at first glance.

    A deeply emotional story exploring human nature (particularly its weakness), family ties/disconnections and karma which is really well told despite being slow and meandering at times. Black and white definitely adds something to the film. One of the best things about this film is that the interpretation is left up to you - just like life. I get the feeling my empathy will change from one character to another depending on my viewpoint of life. On this occasion I focused on the mother, her isolation, susceptibility to the opinions of others and how this distorted and transformed her intense love for her family into something wicked and ugly. I have huge admiration for the character insight provided by the director always shying away from telling the audience what to think or how to interpret it. Still puzzled by the long scene showing dragonflies and lilies on the pond. It was waaaaaaaay too long. Also the religious references were lost on me.

    For twenty whole years of my life I lived in ignorance without having seen the sun or the moon but today I have finally seen the Ray and I feel holy and blessed now. Akira Kurusawa, the man behind Japanese classics like Rashomon and Ran rightly said years ago that living in a world without having seen a Satyajit Ray film is similar to living without having seen the sun or moon; almost every film I've watched feels effete after living in Ray's world. It is a transcending experience watching the late Bengali director's debut effort Pather Panchali, one that deeply impacts the very core of your soul in a way that makes you feel afterwards as though you've lived two lives  one before having watched Pather Panchali and one after. It achieves the remarkable feat of invoking your senses to a higher state of consciousness; the experience watching Pather Panchali is similar to reading Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace or some of William Blake's or Emily Dickinson's finest achievements, or watching Meryl Streep's iconic turn as Sophie Zawistowski in Sophie's Choice. The feeling is so powerful that it took me more than an hour to get back to my original state; the hardest part for me was to return the DVD to the movie rental store because I knew the true worth of what I was holding. May god bless the guy who recognized Pather Panchali's worth years ago and preserved the original prints so the world today can have a chance to be transported to the precious little magical world of Apu, the film's protagonist. This little world is black and white to the outer eye, but the film is so richly filmed and composed that it colors our mind with the most exquisite palette. The opening credits, which wouldn't be understood by anyone who can't read Bengali, still captures the spirit of Pather Panchali though Ravi Shankar's playful, whimsical and yearning tabla beats and sitar strums; only Michael Danna could hypnotize us in 2012's Life of Pi with a similarly evocative score. Ray's world opens not with Apu or his sister Durga but with the film's most antagonistic character, the rancorous neighbor of Apu's family who's worshipping the tulsi plant early in the morning. Satyajit follows her as she notices Durga, the still-unborn Apu's sister, stealing fruits from her courtyard. Durga runs along the woods to her shanty home and hands the fruits to her senescent grandaunt Indir Thakrun after keeping milk for her three little cats. Ray then cuts back to the nagging neighbor who is berating Durga and cursing her family for raising a thief; in an excellently composed sequence, Ray is able to seamlessly capture her, the lady listening in the next house balcony listening to her and Durga's pregnant mother Sarbajaya and her empathic friend collecting water from the well behind the neighbor's house, well within earshot of the woman's bitter rant. Sarbajaya confronts her daughter for stealing fruits and then berates Indir Thakrun for encouraging Durga's bad behavior. Indir Thakrun leaves the house temporarily, frustrated by Sarbajaya's nagging, but returns soon as Sarbajaya gives birth to Apu. A couple of dissolves then takes us some years ahead and we see Apu now as an innocent school-going kid who's most fond of his sister Durga. His family is barely able to fulfill their basic needs, with Apu's soft- mannered father Harihar Roy being too lax about asking his dues from his employer; he is neither able to make much as a playwright. This situation makes it especially tough for Sarbajaya to manage the household needs as she herself doesn't like begging others for monetary or any other help; she therefore is all the more harsh on Indir Thakrun, who sometimes like Durga is wont to taking food items from Sarbajaya's kitchen without permission. There are two sequences at different points in the film which include Harihar and Sarbajaya; both retain the same posture in the sequences but while in the first sequence, Harihar gives a more optimistic image to Sarbajaya to pacify her, in the second he sounds less enthusiastic while Sarbajaya looks more worried for their future. Apu is still too young to be affected by the family problems and we only see him enjoying his childhood days with Durga and his friends. Durga is extremely supportive of everybody including her mother, who reacts violently towards Durga when same neighbor in the beginning accuses Durga of stealing her daughter's beaded necklace. The family's problems persist after Harihar travels to nearby city to find work and tragedies strike one after the other; the family's only hope, as told by Harihar in his letters to Sarbajaya after leaving, is to leave everything to God's Grace keeping in mind that everything happens for the better. To Satyajit Ray, every image and every sound, both on-screen and off- screen matter. It's his craftsmanship as a movie visionary that segues the film so well that you are bemused to hear that it's his debut film. I've read one of his books, a compilation of his essays and theories on film, and he mentions how his inexperienced crew hadn't even operated a camera before filming Pather Panchali and so the first half was a little choppy in editing. I don't have any clue what he's talking here because to my eyes, every image was seamlessly stitched together. To me he didn't capture images but rather created images on film; it's difficult to express just how wonderfully he captures Sarbajaya's gradual breakdown in the film without using superlatives. And his genius picture is complemented by Ravi Shankar's background score, which includes sound of bells that ring during a cheerful sequence with a candy man and also during some of the haunting moments; it reminded me of Edgar Allan Poe's brilliant poem The Bells. Pather Panchali is scintillating, and Satyajit is the Ray of Light.

    In 1956, "Pather panchali" opened to the least possible fanfare at the Cannes Film Festival. It was shown at midnight the same time there was a party in honor of Akira Kurosawa, and only a handful of film critics bothered to attend the screening. We can be thankful for the ones who did, among them Bazin, Moskowitz and Anderson. They demanded the film be shown again, and the rest is history. I paraphrase from the essay "Distant Music" written by Philip Kemp, available in the booklet for "Jalsaghar" ('The Music Room', 1958), released by the Criterion Collection. Ray is absolutely amazing. "Charulata" (1964) was my first love, after which I was able to see this and then "Jalsaghar". Now I've been going through his select filmography, and I'm going to have to visit Charu again in the near future. Just like "Jalsaghar", the three films that are the Apu trilogy are an overwhelmingly sober account of life and death, and everything in between. Each film is structured around death, and normally we would have reconciliation. But here we have perceived reconciliation through death, "perceived" in the sense that each time it's short of complete; something is left unsaid, something is amiss. It's all quite shocking, really. Emotionally very draining, and this is Ray's absolute gift. He is able to touch upon a subject like this and examine it whilst retaining a sense of vitality, allowing him not to succumb to heavy-handed melancholy (something I feel Bergman occasionally swerved to) but instead stay rooted in life &nbsp;bittersweet, full of hope, sometimes unanswered. There are some iconic and haunting images in this film that are yet to be matched in their intensity. A beautiful death poem, and a life poem, as well.

    'Pather Panchali', the first one in Satyajit Ray's 'The Apu Trilogy', is a cinematic masterpiece, and the best one in the trilogy. The story, the characters, the situations, everything in this movie overflows with such excruciating reality and brilliance. It well-deservedly won the 'Best Human Document Award' at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. No matter how old and slow the movie is, it's captivating and extremely absorbing from the very beginning, and shows the heights a film, at its best, is capable of achieving. It stands out because of its poetry, its humanity, its haunting lyric beauty, its imagery, and its remarkable portrayal of a family and a culture. Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's impressive screenplay, along with Satyajit Ray's exceptional direction, portrayed through powerful performances by every actor in the movie, makes it the film that it is. Ray's direction is top-notch and one-of-a-kind. The characters, their hopes and dreams, their behaviour and relationships - everything is shown with such brutal realism, relatability and poignancy. I was really able to empathize, and feel the angst and pain of the characters. And if this is not enough, imagine this was Ray's debut movie, and made on a budget that wouldn't buy a five-star meal these days! The movie proves why Satyajit Ray is referred to as the Grand Master of World Cinema. This first part in the trilogy takes you through the starting years of Apu's childhood when he was living in his ancestral home in Bengal, with his parents and sister. The dual themes of progress and loss form the core of this film, as well as the whole trilogy. On a personal note, this is the best film I've ever seen which explores childhood so stunningly. The movie's places, characters and every other thing reminded me of something from my childhood; it was nostalgic and heart-wrenchingly beautiful. There are so many scenes of the siblings which remind wondrous events from one's childhood: the pursuit of a sweet-seller, running across white fields to catch a glimpse of a moving train, a simple picnic among friends in the forest, playfully getting wet in rain, and hiding some evidence so that the other sibling doesn't into trouble. Even the range of intriguing characters in the film is vast; the hardworking but seldom-present father, the overburdened mother, the innocent siblings exploring the world around them, the always complaining or blaming neighbour/landlord, and the old and usually silent old lady in the neighbourhood who's always in her own world. Even at this age, the Trilogy is considered to be one of the most important and brilliant pieces of Cinematic History. Legendary Japanese Filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once aptly said: "Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon."

    Watching the film, Pather Panchali (Song of the Little Road) directed by Satyajit Ray, you would have thought that Ray was a season veteran director, but in truth, it's his debut work about the life of a family in Bengal living in poverty. Based on the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, when Ray started this film, I think Ray had literally never held a movie camera. I understand that Italian neo-realist films had a big influence on him; all to the better. There are a number of key scenes shot in the film that beholds the beauty and emotional depth in itself. The film never had a complete script; it was made from Ray's drawings and notes. Ray tried to extract and build a simple theme out of the apparently random sequences of significants. Some notable shifts from the novel in the script include the death scenes of key characters, one which occurs quite early in the novel in a village shrine at the presence of some adult members of the family; in the film that key character dies in the open in the presence of the family children, Apu and Durga. The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of the train is not there in the novel, neither child manages to see the train there, although they made an attempt. That scene alone is well played. Such a beautiful scene. I love the sounds of the wind and the hum of the electricity, and the slow, fading edits. It captures perfectly the landscape and the young child's curiosity. The train shows the changes happening in India, and we know the children will grow into a world that is different to their parents. They are left gazing at a thin veil of smoke as the sound of the wind returns. It is very moving. Camera work as usual in Satyajit Ray's film is always brilliant as it has used lot of drifting tracking shot. There almost cosmic emotional power in some other scenes, such as the sunset with Apu and that of the monsoon. The scene from when the snake creeps into an abandoned 'house of sorrows' to their stunned faces on the ox cart was a unforgettable Ravi Shankar theme. I think it foreshadows death. Apu & sister Durga share an intimate bond, they exploring their little world and sharing secrets are the most remarkable aspect of this film. The language might be foreign to me but the emotions were completely native. The film took three years to complete the shooting, and it's was just lucky it got finished with little to no money to product. Pather Panchali was followed by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life 'Aparajito' (The Unvanquished) in 1956 & Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. The only faults I can find in this film is that it's insanely depressing. The movie has a lot of death, and nothing really get any better for the family as the film goes on. There is no happy ever after, as this isn't Slumdog Millionaire. The movie is hard to find, and if found, it's rarely in English subtitles and the video transfer is horrible, the sound transfer only marginally better. Another factor is the disconnection by scene to scene, and gives an all-inclusive quality to the film; yet it is also distracting and contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention as the film pace is slow. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through. It's run time is 122 mins, and there are long periods of time of nothing going on. One can stare in dull amaze for only so long looking at nature. The first half is nearer to social realism, setting out the social hierarchies, introducing characters and their social or family role, defining them against other people, their home and nature. The second half of the film, however, becomes more abstract, even mystical. There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action. Film is still better than 2 most of today's loud, flashy torture bollywood movies. This film is true art.

    Satyajit Ray's debut! A masterpiece. Why? Because it makes you cry. It will make you pull your emotions out. It will do what no other film can do: introspect! Pather Panchali depicts the life and times of a poverty-stricken family, the way the lead lady copes with her life, her kin and her children. The fascination of the kids to see the train pass by, the young girl's eagerness to get married as her friends start settling with their spouses, the little boy's (Apu's) innocent activities will all make you think, think and think. This is not just cinema, this is a wonderful epitome on which we all must try to rely as we continue to lead our lived without meaning. Pather Panchali is EPIC! If you are looking for serious cinema or not, you gotta watch this before you die! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: No Sex: No Mouth-Kiss: No Violence: No Nudity: Women do not wear upper underthings.

Apu is still too young to be affected by the family problems and we only see him enjoying his childhood days with Durga and his friends. Durga is extremely supportive of everybody including her mother, who reacts violently towards Durga when same neighbor in the beginning accuses Durga of stealing her daughter's beaded necklace. The family's problems persist after Harihar travels to nearby city to find work and tragedies strike one after the other; the family's only hope, as told by Harihar in his letters to Sarbajaya after leaving, is to leave everything to God's Grace keeping in mind that everything happens for the better. To Satyajit Ray, every image and every sound, both on-screen and off- screen matter. It's his craftsmanship as a movie visionary that segues the film so well that you are bemused to hear that it's his debut film. I've read one of his books, a compilation of his essays and theories on film, and he mentions how his inexperienced crew hadn't even operated a camera before filming Pather Panchali and so the first half was a little choppy in editing. I don't have any clue what he's talking here because to my eyes, every image was seamlessly stitched together. To me he didn't capture images but rather created images on film; it's difficult to express just how wonderfully he captures Sarbajaya's gradual breakdown in the film without using superlatives. And his genius picture is complemented by Ravi Shankar's background score, which includes sound of bells that ring during a cheerful sequence with a candy man and also during some of the haunting moments; it reminded me of Edgar Allan Poe's brilliant poem The Bells. Pather Panchali is scintillating, and Satyajit is the Ray of Light.

    In 1956, "Pather panchali" opened to the least possible fanfare at the Cannes Film Festival. It was shown at midnight the same time there was a party in honor of Akira Kurosawa, and only a handful of film critics bothered to attend the screening. We can be thankful for the ones who did, among them Bazin, Moskowitz and Anderson. They demanded the film be shown again, and the rest is history. I paraphrase from the essay "Distant Music" written by Philip Kemp, available in the booklet for "Jalsaghar" ('The Music Room', 1958), released by the Criterion Collection. Ray is absolutely amazing. "Charulata" (1964) was my first love, after which I was able to see this and then "Jalsaghar". Now I've been going through his select filmography, and I'm going to have to visit Charu again in the near future. Just like "Jalsaghar", the three films that are the Apu trilogy are an overwhelmingly sober account of life and death, and everything in between. Each film is structured around death, and normally we would have reconciliation. But here we have perceived reconciliation through death, "perceived" in the sense that each time it's short of complete; something is left unsaid, something is amiss. It's all quite shocking, really. Emotionally very draining, and this is Ray's absolute gift. He is able to touch upon a subject like this and examine it whilst retaining a sense of vitality, allowing him not to succumb to heavy-handed melancholy (something I feel Bergman occasionally swerved to) but instead stay rooted in life &nbsp;bittersweet, full of hope, sometimes unanswered. There are some iconic and haunting images in this film that are yet to be matched in their intensity. A beautiful death poem, and a life poem, as well.

    'Pather Panchali', the first one in Satyajit Ray's 'The Apu Trilogy', is a cinematic masterpiece, and the best one in the trilogy. The story, the characters, the situations, everything in this movie overflows with such excruciating reality and brilliance. It well-deservedly won the 'Best Human Document Award' at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. No matter how old and slow the movie is, it's captivating and extremely absorbing from the very beginning, and shows the heights a film, at its best, is capable of achieving. It stands out because of its poetry, its humanity, its haunting lyric beauty, its imagery, and its remarkable portrayal of a family and a culture. Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's impressive screenplay, along with Satyajit Ray's exceptional direction, portrayed through powerful performances by every actor in the movie, makes it the film that it is. Ray's direction is top-notch and one-of-a-kind. The characters, their hopes and dreams, their behaviour and relationships - everything is shown with such brutal realism, relatability and poignancy. I was really able to empathize, and feel the angst and pain of the characters. And if this is not enough, imagine this was Ray's debut movie, and made on a budget that wouldn't buy a five-star meal these days! The movie proves why Satyajit Ray is referred to as the Grand Master of World Cinema. This first part in the trilogy takes you through the starting years of Apu's childhood when he was living in his ancestral home in Bengal, with his parents and sister. The dual themes of progress and loss form the core of this film, as well as the whole trilogy. On a personal note, this is the best film I've ever seen which explores childhood so stunningly. The movie's places, characters and every other thing reminded me of something from my childhood; it was nostalgic and heart-wrenchingly beautiful. There are so many scenes of the siblings which remind wondrous events from one's childhood: the pursuit of a sweet-seller, running across white fields to catch a glimpse of a moving train, a simple picnic among friends in the forest, playfully getting wet in rain, and hiding some evidence so that the other sibling doesn't into trouble. Even the range of intriguing characters in the film is vast; the hardworking but seldom-present father, the overburdened mother, the innocent siblings exploring the world around them, the always complaining or blaming neighbour/landlord, and the old and usually silent old lady in the neighbourhood who's always in her own world. Even at this age, the Trilogy is considered to be one of the most important and brilliant pieces of Cinematic History. Legendary Japanese Filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once aptly said: "Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon."

    Watching the film, Pather Panchali (Song of the Little Road) directed by Satyajit Ray, you would have thought that Ray was a season veteran director, but in truth, it's his debut work about the life of a family in Bengal living in poverty. Based on the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, when Ray started this film, I think Ray had literally never held a movie camera. I understand that Italian neo-realist films had a big influence on him; all to the better. There are a number of key scenes shot in the film that beholds the beauty and emotional depth in itself. The film never had a complete script; it was made from Ray's drawings and notes. Ray tried to extract and build a simple theme out of the apparently random sequences of significants. Some notable shifts from the novel in the script include the death scenes of key characters, one which occurs quite early in the novel in a village shrine at the presence of some adult members of the family; in the film that key character dies in the open in the presence of the family children, Apu and Durga. The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of the train is not there in the novel, neither child manages to see the train there, although they made an attempt. That scene alone is well played. Such a beautiful scene. I love the sounds of the wind and the hum of the electricity, and the slow, fading edits. It captures perfectly the landscape and the young child's curiosity. The train shows the changes happening in India, and we know the children will grow into a world that is different to their parents. They are left gazing at a thin veil of smoke as the sound of the wind returns. It is very moving. Camera work as usual in Satyajit Ray's film is always brilliant as it has used lot of drifting tracking shot. There almost cosmic emotional power in some other scenes, such as the sunset with Apu and that of the monsoon. The scene from when the snake creeps into an abandoned 'house of sorrows' to their stunned faces on the ox cart was a unforgettable Ravi Shankar theme. I think it foreshadows death. Apu & sister Durga share an intimate bond, they exploring their little world and sharing secrets are the most remarkable aspect of this film. The language might be foreign to me but the emotions were completely native. The film took three years to complete the shooting, and it's was just lucky it got finished with little to no money to product. Pather Panchali was followed by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life 'Aparajito' (The Unvanquished) in 1956 & Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. The only faults I can find in this film is that it's insanely depressing. The movie has a lot of death, and nothing really get any better for the family as the film goes on. There is no happy ever after, as this isn't Slumdog Millionaire. The movie is hard to find, and if found, it's rarely in English subtitles and the video transfer is horrible, the sound transfer only marginally better. Another factor is the disconnection by scene to scene, and gives an all-inclusive quality to the film; yet it is also distracting and contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention as the film pace is slow. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through. It's run time is 122 mins, and there are long periods of time of nothing going on. One can stare in dull amaze for only so long looking at nature. The first half is nearer to social realism, setting out the social hierarchies, introducing characters and their social or family role, defining them against other people, their home and nature. The second half of the film, however, becomes more abstract, even mystical. There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action. Film is still better than 2 most of today's loud, flashy torture bollywood movies. This film is true art.

    Satyajit Ray's debut! A masterpiece. Why? Because it makes you cry. It will make you pull your emotions out. It will do what no other film can do: introspect! Pather Panchali depicts the life and times of a poverty-stricken family, the way the lead lady copes with her life, her kin and her children. The fascination of the kids to see the train pass by, the young girl's eagerness to get married as her friends start settling with their spouses, the little boy's (Apu's) innocent activities will all make you think, think and think. This is not just cinema, this is a wonderful epitome on which we all must try to rely as we continue to lead our lived without meaning. Pather Panchali is EPIC! If you are looking for serious cinema or not, you gotta watch this before you die! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: No Sex: No Mouth-Kiss: No Violence: No Nudity: Women do not wear upper underthings.

    There are movies that you watch and forget even if they were good and then there are some that linger on for some strange reason. This, as expected, was one of those very few. The technical quality can be discounted completely as it was made in the '50s and on a shoestring budget but, what really stands out, is the quality of the content per every minute that the film rolls.... Unbelievable!!! The message that is conveyed is universal and the subtlety is remarkable. I am not saying this because I am from India but for the fact that Ray was as brilliant universally as Bergman and the likes. Watch it with an open mind and you will not be disappointed.

    The film is a true example of presenting the humanity. The film is about a poor Bengali family who is struggling to make their ends meet. Their wishes are very simple and true to the situation. The two children are amazing. First Durga mesmerizes you with her looks and her running styles and then comes Apu, whose eyes say everything. The one who steals the show is the mother of children. Circles around her eyes always say a lot more than she wants to represent. Their father also performs the role very nicely. I was very happy to see the acting. The soundtrack although not too much engaging, at times gives a strange nice feeling. The story is no doubt good but what makes this film more fascinating than it might have been in the book is the ability of a great maestro (Satyajit Ray) to represent them with so profound emotion. The outcome after the difficulties he had faced during the making is truly a treat to watch. MESSAGE: "Life goes on." VERDICT: "A must watch for all cine lovers."

    Pather Panchali marked the introduction of Satyajit Ray, arguably India's finest filmmaker. Pather Panchali, based on Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's identically titled novel, is the story of a small family in a rural Indian setting. Pather Panchali is the first film of the "Apu Trilogy", the three Ray films chronicling the life of Apu, a village boy, over the years. The film bears signs of what would make Ray a renowned name in world cinema in the years to follow. The immensely faithful portrayal of the life of the primary characters, complete with their hopes, dreams, petty troubles and idiosyncrasies, resonated deeply with the psyche of the Indian audience.

    This is one of those movies that, as a lover of film, I felt obliged to watch because of its status in film history rather than any real burning desire on my part. That's what is so wonderful about cinema - it can surprise and beguile you when you least expect it. Pather Panchali, although steeped in Indian culture, tells a universal story of the human condition. Apu is the only son of an impoverished family whose father must leave home for months in order to find work. While he is gone life grows even harder for his wife and two children, Apu and his older sister Durga. Pather Panchali won't appeal to all tastes. It's nothing like the ultra-colourful Bollywood output we're all familiar with to some degree today. No songs or dances, for a start. Instead, it is a measured, contemplative reflection on the beauty that can be found in the world regardless of the hardship of life. Subrata Mitra's reflective camera dwells on something as mundane as gnats skimming across water, for example, and by forcing the viewer's attention in the desired direction, somehow turns them into things of beauty. Similarly, the close relationship between Apu and his ill-fated sister, while as understated as the rest of the film, is both heart-warming and devastating. Definitely one to catch if you can - even if it doesn't really appeal at first glance.

    A deeply emotional story exploring human nature (particularly its weakness), family ties/disconnections and karma which is really well told despite being slow and meandering at times. Black and white definitely adds something to the film. One of the best things about this film is that the interpretation is left up to you - just like life. I get the feeling my empathy will change from one character to another depending on my viewpoint of life. On this occasion I focused on the mother, her isolation, susceptibility to the opinions of others and how this distorted and transformed her intense love for her family into something wicked and ugly. I have huge admiration for the character insight provided by the director always shying away from telling the audience what to think or how to interpret it. Still puzzled by the long scene showing dragonflies and lilies on the pond. It was waaaaaaaay too long. Also the religious references were lost on me.

    For twenty whole years of my life I lived in ignorance without having seen the sun or the moon but today I have finally seen the Ray and I feel holy and blessed now. Akira Kurusawa, the man behind Japanese classics like Rashomon and Ran rightly said years ago that living in a world without having seen a Satyajit Ray film is similar to living without having seen the sun or moon; almost every film I've watched feels effete after living in Ray's world. It is a transcending experience watching the late Bengali director's debut effort Pather Panchali, one that deeply impacts the very core of your soul in a way that makes you feel afterwards as though you've lived two lives  one before having watched Pather Panchali and one after. It achieves the remarkable feat of invoking your senses to a higher state of consciousness; the experience watching Pather Panchali is similar to reading Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace or some of William Blake's or Emily Dickinson's finest achievements, or watching Meryl Streep's iconic turn as Sophie Zawistowski in Sophie's Choice. The feeling is so powerful that it took me more than an hour to get back to my original state; the hardest part for me was to return the DVD to the movie rental store because I knew the true worth of what I was holding. May god bless the guy who recognized Pather Panchali's worth years ago and preserved the original prints so the world today can have a chance to be transported to the precious little magical world of Apu, the film's protagonist. This little world is black and white to the outer eye, but the film is so richly filmed and composed that it colors our mind with the most exquisite palette. The opening credits, which wouldn't be understood by anyone who can't read Bengali, still captures the spirit of Pather Panchali though Ravi Shankar's playful, whimsical and yearning tabla beats and sitar strums; only Michael Danna could hypnotize us in 2012's Life of Pi with a similarly evocative score. Ray's world opens not with Apu or his sister Durga but with the film's most antagonistic character, the rancorous neighbor of Apu's family who's worshipping the tulsi plant early in the morning. Satyajit follows her as she notices Durga, the still-unborn Apu's sister, stealing fruits from her courtyard. Durga runs along the woods to her shanty home and hands the fruits to her senescent grandaunt Indir Thakrun after keeping milk for her three little cats. Ray then cuts back to the nagging neighbor who is berating Durga and cursing her family for raising a thief; in an excellently composed sequence, Ray is able to seamlessly capture her, the lady listening in the next house balcony listening to her and Durga's pregnant mother Sarbajaya and her empathic friend collecting water from the well behind the neighbor's house, well within earshot of the woman's bitter rant. Sarbajaya confronts her daughter for stealing fruits and then berates Indir Thakrun for encouraging Durga's bad behavior. Indir Thakrun leaves the house temporarily, frustrated by Sarbajaya's nagging, but returns soon as Sarbajaya gives birth to Apu. A couple of dissolves then takes us some years ahead and we see Apu now as an innocent school-going kid who's most fond of his sister Durga. His family is barely able to fulfill their basic needs, with Apu's soft- mannered father Harihar Roy being too lax about asking his dues from his employer; he is neither able to make much as a playwright. This situation makes it especially tough for Sarbajaya to manage the household needs as she herself doesn't like begging others for monetary or any other help; she therefore is all the more harsh on Indir Thakrun, who sometimes like Durga is wont to taking food items from Sarbajaya's kitchen without permission. There are two sequences at different points in the film which include Harihar and Sarbajaya; both retain the same posture in the sequences but while in the first sequence, Harihar gives a more optimistic image to Sarbajaya to pacify her, in the second he sounds less enthusiastic while Sarbajaya looks more worried for their future. Apu is still too young to be affected by the family problems and we only see him enjoying his childhood days with Durga and his friends. Durga is extremely supportive of everybody including her mother, who reacts violently towards Durga when same neighbor in the beginning accuses Durga of stealing her daughter's beaded necklace. The family's problems persist after Harihar travels to nearby city to find work and tragedies strike one after the other; the family's only hope, as told by Harihar in his letters to Sarbajaya after leaving, is to leave everything to God's Grace keeping in mind that everything happens for the better. To Satyajit Ray, every image and every sound, both on-screen and off- screen matter. It's his craftsmanship as a movie visionary that segues the film so well that you are bemused to hear that it's his debut film. I've read one of his books, a compilation of his essays and theories on film, and he mentions how his inexperienced crew hadn't even operated a camera before filming Pather Panchali and so the first half was a little choppy in editing.

And his genius picture is complemented by Ravi Shankar's background score, which includes sound of bells that ring during a cheerful sequence with a candy man and also during some of the haunting moments; it reminded me of Edgar Allan Poe's brilliant poem The Bells. Pather Panchali is scintillating, and Satyajit is the Ray of Light.

Pather Panchali was followed by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life 'Aparajito' (The Unvanquished) in 1956 & Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. The only faults I can find in this film is that it's insanely depressing. The movie has a lot of death, and nothing really get any better for the family as the film goes on. There is no happy ever after, as this isn't Slumdog Millionaire. The movie is hard to find, and if found, it's rarely in English subtitles and the video transfer is horrible, the sound transfer only marginally better. Another factor is the disconnection by scene to scene, and gives an all-inclusive quality to the film; yet it is also distracting and contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention as the film pace is slow. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through. It's run time is 122 mins, and there are long periods of time of nothing going on. One can stare in dull amaze for only so long looking at nature. The first half is nearer to social realism, setting out the social hierarchies, introducing characters and their social or family role, defining them against other people, their home and nature. The second half of the film, however, becomes more abstract, even mystical. There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action. Film is still better than 2 most of today's loud, flashy torture bollywood movies. This film is true art.

    Satyajit Ray's debut! A masterpiece. Why? Because it makes you cry. It will make you pull your emotions out. It will do what no other film can do: introspect! Pather Panchali depicts the life and times of a poverty-stricken family, the way the lead lady copes with her life, her kin and her children. The fascination of the kids to see the train pass by, the young girl's eagerness to get married as her friends start settling with their spouses, the little boy's (Apu's) innocent activities will all make you think, think and think. This is not just cinema, this is a wonderful epitome on which we all must try to rely as we continue to lead our lived without meaning. Pather Panchali is EPIC! If you are looking for serious cinema or not, you gotta watch this before you die! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: No Sex: No Mouth-Kiss: No Violence: No Nudity: Women do not wear upper underthings.

    There are movies that you watch and forget even if they were good and then there are some that linger on for some strange reason. This, as expected, was one of those very few. The technical quality can be discounted completely as it was made in the '50s and on a shoestring budget but, what really stands out, is the quality of the content per every minute that the film rolls.... Unbelievable!!! The message that is conveyed is universal and the subtlety is remarkable. I am not saying this because I am from India but for the fact that Ray was as brilliant universally as Bergman and the likes. Watch it with an open mind and you will not be disappointed.

    The film is a true example of presenting the humanity. The film is about a poor Bengali family who is struggling to make their ends meet. Their wishes are very simple and true to the situation. The two children are amazing. First Durga mesmerizes you with her looks and her running styles and then comes Apu, whose eyes say everything. The one who steals the show is the mother of children. Circles around her eyes always say a lot more than she wants to represent. Their father also performs the role very nicely. I was very happy to see the acting. The soundtrack although not too much engaging, at times gives a strange nice feeling. The story is no doubt good but what makes this film more fascinating than it might have been in the book is the ability of a great maestro (Satyajit Ray) to represent them with so profound emotion. The outcome after the difficulties he had faced during the making is truly a treat to watch. MESSAGE: "Life goes on." VERDICT: "A must watch for all cine lovers."

    Pather Panchali marked the introduction of Satyajit Ray, arguably India's finest filmmaker. Pather Panchali, based on Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's identically titled novel, is the story of a small family in a rural Indian setting. Pather Panchali is the first film of the "Apu Trilogy", the three Ray films chronicling the life of Apu, a village boy, over the years. The film bears signs of what would make Ray a renowned name in world cinema in the years to follow. The immensely faithful portrayal of the life of the primary characters, complete with their hopes, dreams, petty troubles and idiosyncrasies, resonated deeply with the psyche of the Indian audience.

    This is one of those movies that, as a lover of film, I felt obliged to watch because of its status in film history rather than any real burning desire on my part. That's what is so wonderful about cinema - it can surprise and beguile you when you least expect it. Pather Panchali, although steeped in Indian culture, tells a universal story of the human condition. Apu is the only son of an impoverished family whose father must leave home for months in order to find work. While he is gone life grows even harder for his wife and two children, Apu and his older sister Durga. Pather Panchali won't appeal to all tastes. It's nothing like the ultra-colourful Bollywood output we're all familiar with to some degree today. No songs or dances, for a start. Instead, it is a measured, contemplative reflection on the beauty that can be found in the world regardless of the hardship of life. Subrata Mitra's reflective camera dwells on something as mundane as gnats skimming across water, for example, and by forcing the viewer's attention in the desired direction, somehow turns them into things of beauty. Similarly, the close relationship between Apu and his ill-fated sister, while as understated as the rest of the film, is both heart-warming and devastating. Definitely one to catch if you can - even if it doesn't really appeal at first glance.

    A deeply emotional story exploring human nature (particularly its weakness), family ties/disconnections and karma which is really well told despite being slow and meandering at times. Black and white definitely adds something to the film. One of the best things about this film is that the interpretation is left up to you - just like life. I get the feeling my empathy will change from one character to another depending on my viewpoint of life. On this occasion I focused on the mother, her isolation, susceptibility to the opinions of others and how this distorted and transformed her intense love for her family into something wicked and ugly. I have huge admiration for the character insight provided by the director always shying away from telling the audience what to think or how to interpret it. Still puzzled by the long scene showing dragonflies and lilies on the pond. It was waaaaaaaay too long. Also the religious references were lost on me.

    For twenty whole years of my life I lived in ignorance without having seen the sun or the moon but today I have finally seen the Ray and I feel holy and blessed now. Akira Kurusawa, the man behind Japanese classics like Rashomon and Ran rightly said years ago that living in a world without having seen a Satyajit Ray film is similar to living without having seen the sun or moon; almost every film I've watched feels effete after living in Ray's world. It is a transcending experience watching the late Bengali director's debut effort Pather Panchali, one that deeply impacts the very core of your soul in a way that makes you feel afterwards as though you've lived two lives  one before having watched Pather Panchali and one after. It achieves the remarkable feat of invoking your senses to a higher state of consciousness; the experience watching Pather Panchali is similar to reading Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace or some of William Blake's or Emily Dickinson's finest achievements, or watching Meryl Streep's iconic turn as Sophie Zawistowski in Sophie's Choice. The feeling is so powerful that it took me more than an hour to get back to my original state; the hardest part for me was to return the DVD to the movie rental store because I knew the true worth of what I was holding. May god bless the guy who recognized Pather Panchali's worth years ago and preserved the original prints so the world today can have a chance to be transported to the precious little magical world of Apu, the film's protagonist. This little world is black and white to the outer eye, but the film is so richly filmed and composed that it colors our mind with the most exquisite palette. The opening credits, which wouldn't be understood by anyone who can't read Bengali, still captures the spirit of Pather Panchali though Ravi Shankar's playful, whimsical and yearning tabla beats and sitar strums; only Michael Danna could hypnotize us in 2012's Life of Pi with a similarly evocative score. Ray's world opens not with Apu or his sister Durga but with the film's most antagonistic character, the rancorous neighbor of Apu's family who's worshipping the tulsi plant early in the morning. Satyajit follows her as she notices Durga, the still-unborn Apu's sister, stealing fruits from her courtyard. Durga runs along the woods to her shanty home and hands the fruits to her senescent grandaunt Indir Thakrun after keeping milk for her three little cats. Ray then cuts back to the nagging neighbor who is berating Durga and cursing her family for raising a thief; in an excellently composed sequence, Ray is able to seamlessly capture her, the lady listening in the next house balcony listening to her and Durga's pregnant mother Sarbajaya and her empathic friend collecting water from the well behind the neighbor's house, well within earshot of the woman's bitter rant. Sarbajaya confronts her daughter for stealing fruits and then berates Indir Thakrun for encouraging Durga's bad behavior. Indir Thakrun leaves the house temporarily, frustrated by Sarbajaya's nagging, but returns soon as Sarbajaya gives birth to Apu. A couple of dissolves then takes us some years ahead and we see Apu now as an innocent school-going kid who's most fond of his sister Durga. His family is barely able to fulfill their basic needs, with Apu's soft- mannered father Harihar Roy being too lax about asking his dues from his employer; he is neither able to make much as a playwright. This situation makes it especially tough for Sarbajaya to manage the household needs as she herself doesn't like begging others for monetary or any other help; she therefore is all the more harsh on Indir Thakrun, who sometimes like Durga is wont to taking food items from Sarbajaya's kitchen without permission. There are two sequences at different points in the film which include Harihar and Sarbajaya; both retain the same posture in the sequences but while in the first sequence, Harihar gives a more optimistic image to Sarbajaya to pacify her, in the second he sounds less enthusiastic while Sarbajaya looks more worried for their future. Apu is still too young to be affected by the family problems and we only see him enjoying his childhood days with Durga and his friends. Durga is extremely supportive of everybody including her mother, who reacts violently towards Durga when same neighbor in the beginning accuses Durga of stealing her daughter's beaded necklace. The family's problems persist after Harihar travels to nearby city to find work and tragedies strike one after the other; the family's only hope, as told by Harihar in his letters to Sarbajaya after leaving, is to leave everything to God's Grace keeping in mind that everything happens for the better. To Satyajit Ray, every image and every sound, both on-screen and off- screen matter. It's his craftsmanship as a movie visionary that segues the film so well that you are bemused to hear that it's his debut film. I've read one of his books, a compilation of his essays and theories on film, and he mentions how his inexperienced crew hadn't even operated a camera before filming Pather Panchali and so the first half was a little choppy in editing. I don't have any clue what he's talking here because to my eyes, every image was seamlessly stitched together. To me he didn't capture images but rather created images on film; it's difficult to express just how wonderfully he captures Sarbajaya's gradual breakdown in the film without using superlatives. And his genius picture is complemented by Ravi Shankar's background score, which includes sound of bells that ring during a cheerful sequence with a candy man and also during some of the haunting moments; it reminded me of Edgar Allan Poe's brilliant poem The Bells. Pather Panchali is scintillating, and Satyajit is the Ray of Light.

    In 1956, "Pather panchali" opened to the least possible fanfare at the Cannes Film Festival. It was shown at midnight the same time there was a party in honor of Akira Kurosawa, and only a handful of film critics bothered to attend the screening. We can be thankful for the ones who did, among them Bazin, Moskowitz and Anderson. They demanded the film be shown again, and the rest is history. I paraphrase from the essay "Distant Music" written by Philip Kemp, available in the booklet for "Jalsaghar" ('The Music Room', 1958), released by the Criterion Collection. Ray is absolutely amazing. "Charulata" (1964) was my first love, after which I was able to see this and then "Jalsaghar". Now I've been going through his select filmography, and I'm going to have to visit Charu again in the near future. Just like "Jalsaghar", the three films that are the Apu trilogy are an overwhelmingly sober account of life and death, and everything in between. Each film is structured around death, and normally we would have reconciliation. But here we have perceived reconciliation through death, "perceived" in the sense that each time it's short of complete; something is left unsaid, something is amiss. It's all quite shocking, really. Emotionally very draining, and this is Ray's absolute gift. He is able to touch upon a subject like this and examine it whilst retaining a sense of vitality, allowing him not to succumb to heavy-handed melancholy (something I feel Bergman occasionally swerved to) but instead stay rooted in life &nbsp;bittersweet, full of hope, sometimes unanswered. There are some iconic and haunting images in this film that are yet to be matched in their intensity. A beautiful death poem, and a life poem, as well.

    'Pather Panchali', the first one in Satyajit Ray's 'The Apu Trilogy', is a cinematic masterpiece, and the best one in the trilogy. The story, the characters, the situations, everything in this movie overflows with such excruciating reality and brilliance. It well-deservedly won the 'Best Human Document Award' at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. No matter how old and slow the movie is, it's captivating and extremely absorbing from the very beginning, and shows the heights a film, at its best, is capable of achieving. It stands out because of its poetry, its humanity, its haunting lyric beauty, its imagery, and its remarkable portrayal of a family and a culture. Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's impressive screenplay, along with Satyajit Ray's exceptional direction, portrayed through powerful performances by every actor in the movie, makes it the film that it is. Ray's direction is top-notch and one-of-a-kind. The characters, their hopes and dreams, their behaviour and relationships - everything is shown with such brutal realism, relatability and poignancy. I was really able to empathize, and feel the angst and pain of the characters. And if this is not enough, imagine this was Ray's debut movie, and made on a budget that wouldn't buy a five-star meal these days! The movie proves why Satyajit Ray is referred to as the Grand Master of World Cinema. This first part in the trilogy takes you through the starting years of Apu's childhood when he was living in his ancestral home in Bengal, with his parents and sister. The dual themes of progress and loss form the core of this film, as well as the whole trilogy. On a personal note, this is the best film I've ever seen which explores childhood so stunningly. The movie's places, characters and every other thing reminded me of something from my childhood; it was nostalgic and heart-wrenchingly beautiful. There are so many scenes of the siblings which remind wondrous events from one's childhood: the pursuit of a sweet-seller, running across white fields to catch a glimpse of a moving train, a simple picnic among friends in the forest, playfully getting wet in rain, and hiding some evidence so that the other sibling doesn't into trouble. Even the range of intriguing characters in the film is vast; the hardworking but seldom-present father, the overburdened mother, the innocent siblings exploring the world around them, the always complaining or blaming neighbour/landlord, and the old and usually silent old lady in the neighbourhood who's always in her own world. Even at this age, the Trilogy is considered to be one of the most important and brilliant pieces of Cinematic History. Legendary Japanese Filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once aptly said: "Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon."

    Watching the film, Pather Panchali (Song of the Little Road) directed by Satyajit Ray, you would have thought that Ray was a season veteran director, but in truth, it's his debut work about the life of a family in Bengal living in poverty. Based on the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, when Ray started this film, I think Ray had literally never held a movie camera. I understand that Italian neo-realist films had a big influence on him; all to the better. There are a number of key scenes shot in the film that beholds the beauty and emotional depth in itself. The film never had a complete script; it was made from Ray's drawings and notes. Ray tried to extract and build a simple theme out of the apparently random sequences of significants. Some notable shifts from the novel in the script include the death scenes of key characters, one which occurs quite early in the novel in a village shrine at the presence of some adult members of the family; in the film that key character dies in the open in the presence of the family children, Apu and Durga. The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of the train is not there in the novel, neither child manages to see the train there, although they made an attempt. That scene alone is well played. Such a beautiful scene. I love the sounds of the wind and the hum of the electricity, and the slow, fading edits. It captures perfectly the landscape and the young child's curiosity. The train shows the changes happening in India, and we know the children will grow into a world that is different to their parents. They are left gazing at a thin veil of smoke as the sound of the wind returns. It is very moving. Camera work as usual in Satyajit Ray's film is always brilliant as it has used lot of drifting tracking shot. There almost cosmic emotional power in some other scenes, such as the sunset with Apu and that of the monsoon. The scene from when the snake creeps into an abandoned 'house of sorrows' to their stunned faces on the ox cart was a unforgettable Ravi Shankar theme. I think it foreshadows death. Apu & sister Durga share an intimate bond, they exploring their little world and sharing secrets are the most remarkable aspect of this film. The language might be foreign to me but the emotions were completely native. The film took three years to complete the shooting, and it's was just lucky it got finished with little to no money to product. Pather Panchali was followed by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life 'Aparajito' (The Unvanquished) in 1956 & Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. The only faults I can find in this film is that it's insanely depressing. The movie has a lot of death, and nothing really get any better for the family as the film goes on. There is no happy ever after, as this isn't Slumdog Millionaire. The movie is hard to find, and if found, it's rarely in English subtitles and the video transfer is horrible, the sound transfer only marginally better. Another factor is the disconnection by scene to scene, and gives an all-inclusive quality to the film; yet it is also distracting and contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention as the film pace is slow. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through. It's run time is 122 mins, and there are long periods of time of nothing going on. One can stare in dull amaze for only so long looking at nature. The first half is nearer to social realism, setting out the social hierarchies, introducing characters and their social or family role, defining them against other people, their home and nature. The second half of the film, however, becomes more abstract, even mystical. There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action. Film is still better than 2 most of today's loud, flashy torture bollywood movies. This film is true art.

    For twenty whole years of my life I lived in ignorance without having seen the sun or the moon but today I have finally seen the Ray and I feel holy and blessed now. Akira Kurusawa, the man behind Japanese classics like Rashomon and Ran rightly said years ago that living in a world without having seen a Satyajit Ray film is similar to living without having seen the sun or moon; almost every film I've watched feels effete after living in Ray's world. It is a transcending experience watching the late Bengali director's debut effort Pather Panchali, one that deeply impacts the very core of your soul in a way that makes you feel afterwards as though you've lived two lives  one before having watched Pather Panchali and one after. It achieves the remarkable feat of invoking your senses to a higher state of consciousness; the experience watching Pather Panchali is similar to reading Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace or some of William Blake's or Emily Dickinson's finest achievements, or watching Meryl Streep's iconic turn as Sophie Zawistowski in Sophie's Choice. The feeling is so powerful that it took me more than an hour to get back to my original state; the hardest part for me was to return the DVD to the movie rental store because I knew the true worth of what I was holding. May god bless the guy who recognized Pather Panchali's worth years ago and preserved the original prints so the world today can have a chance to be transported to the precious little magical world of Apu, the film's protagonist. This little world is black and white to the outer eye, but the film is so richly filmed and composed that it colors our mind with the most exquisite palette. The opening credits, which wouldn't be understood by anyone who can't read Bengali, still captures the spirit of Pather Panchali though Ravi Shankar's playful, whimsical and yearning tabla beats and sitar strums; only Michael Danna could hypnotize us in 2012's Life of Pi with a similarly evocative score. Ray's world opens not with Apu or his sister Durga but with the film's most antagonistic character, the rancorous neighbor of Apu's family who's worshipping the tulsi plant early in the morning. Satyajit follows her as she notices Durga, the still-unborn Apu's sister, stealing fruits from her courtyard. Durga runs along the woods to her shanty home and hands the fruits to her senescent grandaunt Indir Thakrun after keeping milk for her three little cats. Ray then cuts back to the nagging neighbor who is berating Durga and cursing her family for raising a thief; in an excellently composed sequence, Ray is able to seamlessly capture her, the lady listening in the next house balcony listening to her and Durga's pregnant mother Sarbajaya and her empathic friend collecting water from the well behind the neighbor's house, well within earshot of the woman's bitter rant. Sarbajaya confronts her daughter for stealing fruits and then berates Indir Thakrun for encouraging Durga's bad behavior. Indir Thakrun leaves the house temporarily, frustrated by Sarbajaya's nagging, but returns soon as Sarbajaya gives birth to Apu. A couple of dissolves then takes us some years ahead and we see Apu now as an innocent school-going kid who's most fond of his sister Durga. His family is barely able to fulfill their basic needs, with Apu's soft- mannered father Harihar Roy being too lax about asking his dues from his employer; he is neither able to make much as a playwright. This situation makes it especially tough for Sarbajaya to manage the household needs as she herself doesn't like begging others for monetary or any other help; she therefore is all the more harsh on Indir Thakrun, who sometimes like Durga is wont to taking food items from Sarbajaya's kitchen without permission. There are two sequences at different points in the film which include Harihar and Sarbajaya; both retain the same posture in the sequences but while in the first sequence, Harihar gives a more optimistic image to Sarbajaya to pacify her, in the second he sounds less enthusiastic while Sarbajaya looks more worried for their future. Apu is still too young to be affected by the family problems and we only see him enjoying his childhood days with Durga and his friends. Durga is extremely supportive of everybody including her mother, who reacts violently towards Durga when same neighbor in the beginning accuses Durga of stealing her daughter's beaded necklace. The family's problems persist after Harihar travels to nearby city to find work and tragedies strike one after the other; the family's only hope, as told by Harihar in his letters to Sarbajaya after leaving, is to leave everything to God's Grace keeping in mind that everything happens for the better. To Satyajit Ray, every image and every sound, both on-screen and off- screen matter. It's his craftsmanship as a movie visionary that segues the film so well that you are bemused to hear that it's his debut film. I've read one of his books, a compilation of his essays and theories on film, and he mentions how his inexperienced crew hadn't even operated a camera before filming Pather Panchali and so the first half was a little choppy in editing. I don't have any clue what he's talking here because to my eyes, every image was seamlessly stitched together. To me he didn't capture images but rather created images on film; it's difficult to express just how wonderfully he captures Sarbajaya's gradual breakdown in the film without using superlatives. And his genius picture is complemented by Ravi Shankar's background score, which includes sound of bells that ring during a cheerful sequence with a candy man and also during some of the haunting moments; it reminded me of Edgar Allan Poe's brilliant poem The Bells. Pather Panchali is scintillating, and Satyajit is the Ray of Light.

    In 1956, "Pather panchali" opened to the least possible fanfare at the Cannes Film Festival. It was shown at midnight the same time there was a party in honor of Akira Kurosawa, and only a handful of film critics bothered to attend the screening. We can be thankful for the ones who did, among them Bazin, Moskowitz and Anderson. They demanded the film be shown again, and the rest is history. I paraphrase from the essay "Distant Music" written by Philip Kemp, available in the booklet for "Jalsaghar" ('The Music Room', 1958), released by the Criterion Collection. Ray is absolutely amazing. "Charulata" (1964) was my first love, after which I was able to see this and then "Jalsaghar". Now I've been going through his select filmography, and I'm going to have to visit Charu again in the near future. Just like "Jalsaghar", the three films that are the Apu trilogy are an overwhelmingly sober account of life and death, and everything in between. Each film is structured around death, and normally we would have reconciliation. But here we have perceived reconciliation through death, "perceived" in the sense that each time it's short of complete; something is left unsaid, something is amiss. It's all quite shocking, really. Emotionally very draining, and this is Ray's absolute gift. He is able to touch upon a subject like this and examine it whilst retaining a sense of vitality, allowing him not to succumb to heavy-handed melancholy (something I feel Bergman occasionally swerved to) but instead stay rooted in life &nbsp;bittersweet, full of hope, sometimes unanswered. There are some iconic and haunting images in this film that are yet to be matched in their intensity. A beautiful death poem, and a life poem, as well.

    'Pather Panchali', the first one in Satyajit Ray's 'The Apu Trilogy', is a cinematic masterpiece, and the best one in the trilogy. The story, the characters, the situations, everything in this movie overflows with such excruciating reality and brilliance. It well-deservedly won the 'Best Human Document Award' at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. No matter how old and slow the movie is, it's captivating and extremely absorbing from the very beginning, and shows the heights a film, at its best, is capable of achieving. It stands out because of its poetry, its humanity, its haunting lyric beauty, its imagery, and its remarkable portrayal of a family and a culture. Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's impressive screenplay, along with Satyajit Ray's exceptional direction, portrayed through powerful performances by every actor in the movie, makes it the film that it is. Ray's direction is top-notch and one-of-a-kind. The characters, their hopes and dreams, their behaviour and relationships - everything is shown with such brutal realism, relatability and poignancy. I was really able to empathize, and feel the angst and pain of the characters. And if this is not enough, imagine this was Ray's debut movie, and made on a budget that wouldn't buy a five-star meal these days! The movie proves why Satyajit Ray is referred to as the Grand Master of World Cinema. This first part in the trilogy takes you through the starting years of Apu's childhood when he was living in his ancestral home in Bengal, with his parents and sister. The dual themes of progress and loss form the core of this film, as well as the whole trilogy. On a personal note, this is the best film I've ever seen which explores childhood so stunningly. The movie's places, characters and every other thing reminded me of something from my childhood; it was nostalgic and heart-wrenchingly beautiful. There are so many scenes of the siblings which remind wondrous events from one's childhood: the pursuit of a sweet-seller, running across white fields to catch a glimpse of a moving train, a simple picnic among friends in the forest, playfully getting wet in rain, and hiding some evidence so that the other sibling doesn't into trouble. Even the range of intriguing characters in the film is vast; the hardworking but seldom-present father, the overburdened mother, the innocent siblings exploring the world around them, the always complaining or blaming neighbour/landlord, and the old and usually silent old lady in the neighbourhood who's always in her own world. Even at this age, the Trilogy is considered to be one of the most important and brilliant pieces of Cinematic History. Legendary Japanese Filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once aptly said: "Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon."

    Watching the film, Pather Panchali (Song of the Little Road) directed by Satyajit Ray, you would have thought that Ray was a season veteran director, but in truth, it's his debut work about the life of a family in Bengal living in poverty. Based on the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, when Ray started this film, I think Ray had literally never held a movie camera. I understand that Italian neo-realist films had a big influence on him; all to the better. There are a number of key scenes shot in the film that beholds the beauty and emotional depth in itself. The film never had a complete script; it was made from Ray's drawings and notes. Ray tried to extract and build a simple theme out of the apparently random sequences of significants. Some notable shifts from the novel in the script include the death scenes of key characters, one which occurs quite early in the novel in a village shrine at the presence of some adult members of the family; in the film that key character dies in the open in the presence of the family children, Apu and Durga. The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of the train is not there in the novel, neither child manages to see the train there, although they made an attempt. That scene alone is well played. Such a beautiful scene. I love the sounds of the wind and the hum of the electricity, and the slow, fading edits. It captures perfectly the landscape and the young child's curiosity. The train shows the changes happening in India, and we know the children will grow into a world that is different to their parents. They are left gazing at a thin veil of smoke as the sound of the wind returns. It is very moving. Camera work as usual in Satyajit Ray's film is always brilliant as it has used lot of drifting tracking shot. There almost cosmic emotional power in some other scenes, such as the sunset with Apu and that of the monsoon. The scene from when the snake creeps into an abandoned 'house of sorrows' to their stunned faces on the ox cart was a unforgettable Ravi Shankar theme. I think it foreshadows death. Apu & sister Durga share an intimate bond, they exploring their little world and sharing secrets are the most remarkable aspect of this film. The language might be foreign to me but the emotions were completely native. The film took three years to complete the shooting, and it's was just lucky it got finished with little to no money to product. Pather Panchali was followed by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life 'Aparajito' (The Unvanquished) in 1956 & Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. The only faults I can find in this film is that it's insanely depressing. The movie has a lot of death, and nothing really get any better for the family as the film goes on. There is no happy ever after, as this isn't Slumdog Millionaire. The movie is hard to find, and if found, it's rarely in English subtitles and the video transfer is horrible, the sound transfer only marginally better. Another factor is the disconnection by scene to scene, and gives an all-inclusive quality to the film; yet it is also distracting and contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention as the film pace is slow. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through. It's run time is 122 mins, and there are long periods of time of nothing going on. One can stare in dull amaze for only so long looking at nature. The first half is nearer to social realism, setting out the social hierarchies, introducing characters and their social or family role, defining them against other people, their home and nature. The second half of the film, however, becomes more abstract, even mystical. There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action. Film is still better than 2 most of today's loud, flashy torture bollywood movies. This film is true art.

    Satyajit Ray's debut! A masterpiece. Why? Because it makes you cry. It will make you pull your emotions out. It will do what no other film can do: introspect! Pather Panchali depicts the life and times of a poverty-stricken family, the way the lead lady copes with her life, her kin and her children. The fascination of the kids to see the train pass by, the young girl's eagerness to get married as her friends start settling with their spouses, the little boy's (Apu's) innocent activities will all make you think, think and think. This is not just cinema, this is a wonderful epitome on which we all must try to rely as we continue to lead our lived without meaning. Pather Panchali is EPIC! If you are looking for serious cinema or not, you gotta watch this before you die! Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES Language: No Sex: No Mouth-Kiss: No Violence: No Nudity: Women do not wear upper underthings.

    There are movies that you watch and forget even if they were good and then there are some that linger on for some strange reason. This, as expected, was one of those very few. The technical quality can be discounted completely as it was made in the '50s and on a shoestring budget but, what really stands out, is the quality of the content per every minute that the film rolls.... Unbelievable!!! The message that is conveyed is universal and the subtlety is remarkable. I am not saying this because I am from India but for the fact that Ray was as brilliant universally as Bergman and the likes. Watch it with an open mind and you will not be disappointed.

    The film is a true example of presenting the humanity. The film is about a poor Bengali family who is struggling to make their ends meet. Their wishes are very simple and true to the situation. The two children are amazing. First Durga mesmerizes you with her looks and her running styles and then comes Apu, whose eyes say everything. The one who steals the show is the mother of children. Circles around her eyes always say a lot more than she wants to represent. Their father also performs the role very nicely. I was very happy to see the acting. The soundtrack although not too much engaging, at times gives a strange nice feeling. The story is no doubt good but what makes this film more fascinating than it might have been in the book is the ability of a great maestro (Satyajit Ray) to represent them with so profound emotion. The outcome after the difficulties he had faced during the making is truly a treat to watch. MESSAGE: "Life goes on." VERDICT: "A must watch for all cine lovers."

    Pather Panchali marked the introduction of Satyajit Ray, arguably India's finest filmmaker. Pather Panchali, based on Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's identically titled novel, is the story of a small family in a rural Indian setting. Pather Panchali is the first film of the "Apu Trilogy", the three Ray films chronicling the life of Apu, a village boy, over the years. The film bears signs of what would make Ray a renowned name in world cinema in the years to follow. The immensely faithful portrayal of the life of the primary characters, complete with their hopes, dreams, petty troubles and idiosyncrasies, resonated deeply with the psyche of the Indian audience.

    This is one of those movies that, as a lover of film, I felt obliged to watch because of its status in film history rather than any real burning desire on my part. That's what is so wonderful about cinema - it can surprise and beguile you when you least expect it. Pather Panchali, although steeped in Indian culture, tells a universal story of the human condition. Apu is the only son of an impoverished family whose father must leave home for months in order to find work. While he is gone life grows even harder for his wife and two children, Apu and his older sister Durga. Pather Panchali won't appeal to all tastes. It's nothing like the ultra-colourful Bollywood output we're all familiar with to some degree today. No songs or dances, for a start. Instead, it is a measured, contemplative reflection on the beauty that can be found in the world regardless of the hardship of life. Subrata Mitra's reflective camera dwells on something as mundane as gnats skimming across water, for example, and by forcing the viewer's attention in the desired direction, somehow turns them into things of beauty. Similarly, the close relationship between Apu and his ill-fated sister, while as understated as the rest of the film, is both heart-warming and devastating. Definitely one to catch if you can - even if it doesn't really appeal at first glance.

    A deeply emotional story exploring human nature (particularly its weakness), family ties/disconnections and karma which is really well told despite being slow and meandering at times. Black and white definitely adds something to the film. One of the best things about this film is that the interpretation is left up to you - just like life. I get the feeling my empathy will change from one character to another depending on my viewpoint of life. On this occasion I focused on the mother, her isolation, susceptibility to the opinions of others and how this distorted and transformed her intense love for her family into something wicked and ugly. I have huge admiration for the character insight provided by the director always shying away from telling the audience what to think or how to interpret it. Still puzzled by the long scene showing dragonflies and lilies on the pond. It was waaaaaaaay too long. Also the religious references were lost on me.
