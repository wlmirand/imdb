    I think that this was a strong and powerful movie. It was able to portray many aspects of the Buddhist culture as well as show people the story of the Buddha. This movie is great for people who have little to no knowledge about the Buddhist culture because it gives a great overview and the story line is very interesting. I think it does a good job of mixing in the story of Siddhartha and the storyline of Jesse Conrad. These two stories are really good parallels of each other. Also, I really appreciated the movie because it didn't have those Hollywood stereotypes of a Buddhist monk. Everything was really natural and simple and very easy to understand. Although this movie is somewhat old, I think it still does a good portrayal of the Buddhist culture. People may think that it is outdated, but I think that if one doesn't want to watch a documentary on Buddhism, then they should really watch this movie because along with a great story line of a Buddhist Lama trying to find the reincarnation of his former teacher, it really does give a good background story of Buddhism.

    The little Buddha is about Lama Norbu and other monks seeking the reincarnation of their teacher, Lama Dorje. In their search, the monks believe that the reincarnation of Lama Dorje is in Seattle and is a little boy named Jesse. Jesse is interested in Buddhism, although, does not know much about it. After being hesitant at first when Lama Norbu asks Jesse to return to Bhutan with him, Jesse's father takes Jesse to Bhutan and Nepal. Once there, Jesse meets the other candidates of Lama Norbu's reincarnation, Gita and Raju. Throughout this journey Jesse learns more and more about Buddhism's history and practices with the book Little Buddha. After watching this movie, I learned how seriously monks take reincarnation. Even though Jesse is an outsider of the Buddhist religion, the monks still go through great lengths to find the reincarnation of Lama Norbu and teach Jesse about Buddhism. I also learned that a reincarnation could be broken up into multiple people. In the end, when we figure out that all three of the candidates make up Lama Dorje, we find out that Raju is the body, Gita is speech, and Jesse is his mind. These three aspects of Lama Dorje are also large aspects in Buddhism. I really enjoyed this movie, and could not find any major imperfections. I enjoyed how the movie showed the storybook, Little Buddha, with Siddhartha's life and Jesse's journey. One thing I would have added is more of an ending of what the children decide to do after finding out they make up Lama Dorje, however, chances are all the children wouldn't stay in Bhutan and it is probably better left hanging then having it be a pointless journey. Overall, I think this movie does a good job teaching the viewers about Buddhism, all while bringing the viewers through Jesse's journey. This movie provides a great opportunity for western audiences to learn about Buddhism. Instead of telling you about Siddhartha, this movie shows you who he was and what he did. Not to mention this movie also has a great story line about a boy's journey with Buddhism and Asian cultures.

    A great story, told by an obviously Mahayana Buddhist, where all the mystical elements were applied, but didn't actually take away from the story of Keanu Reeves as the Buddha. I guess that was the only downside for me. Keanu Reeves as the Buddha. I couldn't stop laughing, all I saw when I looked at him in the movie was him playing in Bill & Teds series. "Be excellent to each other". But for real, a good retell of the buddhas life which is what I was looking for when I started watching this movie. I found it interesting that the director chose to through the buddha's whole story in and it compliments well with the present and the little boy in seattle. I think that a lot of Buddhists would enjoy watching this because of the accuracy of the spiritual representation that makes up Buddhism, such as the Mahayana version of buddhas life, as well as how anyone can be the "Buddha" or in this case a "lama", and that's how the connection between the west and the east occur. Very cheesy movie but for those who want to know what Buddhism in its most basic form is all about, I would highly recommend watching it.

    I must admit it: I'm a sucker for fantasy, historic and religious films: be it Lord of the Rings", The Bible" or Conan the Barbarian", I rarely let one pass me by, and so I was pulled into the cinema to see "Little Buddha". In retrospect, the money could have been spent better. The Buddhist faith has always seemed to inspire faith-seeking westerners; after all: the Dalai Lama seems an amiable chap, Richard Gere has done his share in promotion-work and, let's be honest here: the religion has inspired far less war, genocide and general mayhem than other so-called world-religions. However, I cannot imagine many Buddhists being very happy with having Bertolluci turn their faith into a fairy-tale for jaded Westerners. What would Hindus have thought, had James Cameron turned the Bhagadvad Gita into a 3D action flick? Bertolluci is a very good director, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, he's also a director who takes himself a little too serious at times. Rather than relying on his talent, he tends to ham it up for the greater effect. Why rely on the story and the actors, if you could simply add a more impressive sound and extra color, is the question that Betolluci must have asked himself as he was filming. In essence, that's the difference between good directors like Bertolluci and Coppola, and brilliant directors like Werner Herzog. Now, having mentioned the word "ham", we must now speak of protagonist Keanu Reeves. If the Buddhist ideas of reincarnation are correct, chances are good that Keanu Reeves will be reborn as a ham-sandwich. I clearly recall how the entire cinema broke out in laughter, when Reeves opened his mouth for the first time in "Bram Stokers Dracula", trying to imitate an English accent. When Reeves tried his good luck at an Indian accent, nobody in the cinema was laughing, presumably out of embarrassment. Just my neighbor mumbled the famous Peter Sellers line: "Birdy num-num", summing up all that must be said about Reeves "performance" (and almost causing me to soil my pants). By the end of the film I was thinking about the Islamic creed, which prohibits their prophet from being depicted or heard on any medium. "Little Buddha" would have greatly benefited from a similar policy. 3/10 points because it pains me to give a good director like Bertolluci any less (even though, in the case of "Little Buddha", he would probably have deserved it). Plus, we probably have to thank Bertolluci for making this film before M. Night Shyamalan could get his hands on it (casting himself in the leading role, naturally).

    I don't understand all the haters. This movie was understated and calm because of the subject matter, so what did everyone expect from these actors? Drama? This is an anti-drama film. It's about the birth of Buddhism. And Keanu was delightful as Siddhartha. In fact, from what I read about Keanu Reeves, the person, it is my understanding that he is a lot like this character: polite, soft spoken, sensitive, generous, and highly intelligent, all attributes of an enlightened person. And for those who criticize the acting of Bridget Fonda, having watched most if not all her films, it occurs to me that Ms. Fonda has her own style of acting, which is very understated and natural. She is usually cast in roles that don't showcase her talents, but if anybody ever doubts her abilities, or her versatility, they should watch a film she made where she played an assassin, or an abused wife. In this film, she played a little boy's mother very believably. I do agree Chris Isaak was miscast as her husband. For one thing, Bridget Fonda and Chris Isaak strongly resemble one another and could easily be brother and sister. And Chris Isaak is very wooden in the delivery of his lines, making Ms. Fonda's job more difficult. I found the cinematography beautiful, the music beautiful, and the costumes beautiful. This is my second viewing of the film and I really enjoyed it.

    Little Buddha is in fact a fairly accurate story telling of the belief of reincarnation and the origins of the Buddha. This film is perfect for those who want a place to start learning Buddhism. The clever use of the reincarnation story in an American society rather than a Buddhist one shows how radical reincarnation actually seems to the Western demographic. The notion of reincarnation is further elaborated by the concept of "split rebirths," where one body embodies the mind, other embodies the body, and the last embodies speech. The origin story of the Buddha, Gautama Siddhartha, is told through a storybook towards characters that had close to no knowledge on Buddhism. This method allows audiences, who themselves have might have no knowledge of Buddhism, obtain an understanding of the concepts stated in the film. The characters do a great job of asking questions that audiences might want to know, the concept of reincarnation for example. This film allowed me to gain a better understanding of the concept of reincarnation and the many different forms that it can take (singular or multiple). I highly recommend that people watch this if you want to begin learning Buddhism; it's a good resource of beginning learners.

    Good visuals, but my biggest problem with this movie is the butchered story of Siddhartha Gautama. The changed the story so much and left out important things. Not an extremely accurate retelling of the story. I also don't think Keanu Reeves was a good actor for the part of Siddhartha. This movie is decent for what it is, but if you want an accurate telling of Buddhism and Siddhartha, this isn't the movie you're looking for. I personally believe that the tale of Siddhartha is a beautiful thing that should not be altered and kept true to its origin or it loses its meaning. I also don't think that the true story isn't all that complicated for even children to understand. On a more positive note I was impressed at how true they kept to traditional Tibetan Buddhist beliefs.

    I have been viewing this movie on DVD for 7 years now and I still find it uplifting and enlightening. The story/myth Bertolucci & the script writers wrote mixed the old and the new very effectively. The movie is visually exquisite as is the sound track and score. It is rare to get so much spiritual and philosophical information in a Hollywood movie. I recommend Little Buddha for anyone who is interested in cultural ideas and spirituality. A wonderful family movie. Keanu Reeves makes it a draw and to see him in such a historical role makes it all the more watchable for everyone, not just those interested in Buddhism, Bertolucci, or Keanu Reeves. :)

    Surprisingly terrible film given these same people (Bertolluci for director, Sakamoto for music) made the The Last Emperor. Keanu Reeves is painful to listen to here. He only speaks with an irritating, phoney, attempted Indian accent. Sakamoto made such great music for The Last Emperor that it's one of the few soundtracks I've ever bought. But here, the music didn't move me, and I certainly wasn't rewinding scenes to hear the music again and again. The best aspect of the film is the visual appeal, but even here it's ghoolishly grotesque half the time. Bertolucci uses a cold blue lens for the shots in America, which is depressing, and had me wondering why he's adding this salt to the painful wound he already inflicts on me through the thoughts of two pointless Americans with no appeal or charisma. If I want to feel I'm back in ancient India, where your imagination leads you to see its colours and taste its spice and old world charm, I find reading any children's book of Buddha's life far more enriching and entertaining than this film. If you want an interesting intertwining of modern life and the thoughts of Siddharta Gautama, you might find listen to any talk by Ajahn Brahm on Youtube and it'll be far more enriching.

    Berti's soaring effort gets impinged upon by the money guys. Bertolucci's great moment is the unveiling of Keaunu Reeves. Did any man ever look so ahead of his time in 1993? Sadly, though, the business suits are close by, sipping at flasks and nursing coffees, making sure that a layer of heavy sentiment is laid on here, and only a fragmented picture of Siddhartha's progress into divinity there; and the latter treated with exaggerated reverence. It's a shame they didn't make the whole film tell the life of Siddhartha. The rebirth thing is too bizarre and cultish. I'm as at sea with it as the Dad in the mini-family, played by Chris Isaak. Bad news at the business persuades him to take an absurd two-week trip to Nepal with his boy, while Mum grows pregnantly in Seattle, left out of things. Fortunately, the monks find their lama-laddie elsewhere. It's a mixed film but definitely worth seeing for Bertolucci followers.

If you want an interesting intertwining of modern life and the thoughts of Siddharta Gautama, you might find listen to any talk by Ajahn Brahm on Youtube and it'll be far more enriching.

    Berti's soaring effort gets impinged upon by the money guys. Bertolucci's great moment is the unveiling of Keaunu Reeves. Did any man ever look so ahead of his time in 1993? Sadly, though, the business suits are close by, sipping at flasks and nursing coffees, making sure that a layer of heavy sentiment is laid on here, and only a fragmented picture of Siddhartha's progress into divinity there; and the latter treated with exaggerated reverence. It's a shame they didn't make the whole film tell the life of Siddhartha. The rebirth thing is too bizarre and cultish. I'm as at sea with it as the Dad in the mini-family, played by Chris Isaak. Bad news at the business persuades him to take an absurd two-week trip to Nepal with his boy, while Mum grows pregnantly in Seattle, left out of things. Fortunately, the monks find their lama-laddie elsewhere. It's a mixed film but definitely worth seeing for Bertolucci followers.

    I think that this was a strong and powerful movie. It was able to portray many aspects of the Buddhist culture as well as show people the story of the Buddha. This movie is great for people who have little to no knowledge about the Buddhist culture because it gives a great overview and the story line is very interesting. I think it does a good job of mixing in the story of Siddhartha and the storyline of Jesse Conrad. These two stories are really good parallels of each other. Also, I really appreciated the movie because it didn't have those Hollywood stereotypes of a Buddhist monk. Everything was really natural and simple and very easy to understand. Although this movie is somewhat old, I think it still does a good portrayal of the Buddhist culture. People may think that it is outdated, but I think that if one doesn't want to watch a documentary on Buddhism, then they should really watch this movie because along with a great story line of a Buddhist Lama trying to find the reincarnation of his former teacher, it really does give a good background story of Buddhism.

    The little Buddha is about Lama Norbu and other monks seeking the reincarnation of their teacher, Lama Dorje. In their search, the monks believe that the reincarnation of Lama Dorje is in Seattle and is a little boy named Jesse. Jesse is interested in Buddhism, although, does not know much about it. After being hesitant at first when Lama Norbu asks Jesse to return to Bhutan with him, Jesse's father takes Jesse to Bhutan and Nepal. Once there, Jesse meets the other candidates of Lama Norbu's reincarnation, Gita and Raju. Throughout this journey Jesse learns more and more about Buddhism's history and practices with the book Little Buddha. After watching this movie, I learned how seriously monks take reincarnation. Even though Jesse is an outsider of the Buddhist religion, the monks still go through great lengths to find the reincarnation of Lama Norbu and teach Jesse about Buddhism. I also learned that a reincarnation could be broken up into multiple people. In the end, when we figure out that all three of the candidates make up Lama Dorje, we find out that Raju is the body, Gita is speech, and Jesse is his mind. These three aspects of Lama Dorje are also large aspects in Buddhism. I really enjoyed this movie, and could not find any major imperfections. I enjoyed how the movie showed the storybook, Little Buddha, with Siddhartha's life and Jesse's journey. One thing I would have added is more of an ending of what the children decide to do after finding out they make up Lama Dorje, however, chances are all the children wouldn't stay in Bhutan and it is probably better left hanging then having it be a pointless journey. Overall, I think this movie does a good job teaching the viewers about Buddhism, all while bringing the viewers through Jesse's journey. This movie provides a great opportunity for western audiences to learn about Buddhism. Instead of telling you about Siddhartha, this movie shows you who he was and what he did. Not to mention this movie also has a great story line about a boy's journey with Buddhism and Asian cultures.

    A great story, told by an obviously Mahayana Buddhist, where all the mystical elements were applied, but didn't actually take away from the story of Keanu Reeves as the Buddha. I guess that was the only downside for me. Keanu Reeves as the Buddha. I couldn't stop laughing, all I saw when I looked at him in the movie was him playing in Bill & Teds series. "Be excellent to each other". But for real, a good retell of the buddhas life which is what I was looking for when I started watching this movie. I found it interesting that the director chose to through the buddha's whole story in and it compliments well with the present and the little boy in seattle. I think that a lot of Buddhists would enjoy watching this because of the accuracy of the spiritual representation that makes up Buddhism, such as the Mahayana version of buddhas life, as well as how anyone can be the "Buddha" or in this case a "lama", and that's how the connection between the west and the east occur. Very cheesy movie but for those who want to know what Buddhism in its most basic form is all about, I would highly recommend watching it.

    I must admit it: I'm a sucker for fantasy, historic and religious films: be it Lord of the Rings", The Bible" or Conan the Barbarian", I rarely let one pass me by, and so I was pulled into the cinema to see "Little Buddha". In retrospect, the money could have been spent better. The Buddhist faith has always seemed to inspire faith-seeking westerners; after all: the Dalai Lama seems an amiable chap, Richard Gere has done his share in promotion-work and, let's be honest here: the religion has inspired far less war, genocide and general mayhem than other so-called world-religions. However, I cannot imagine many Buddhists being very happy with having Bertolluci turn their faith into a fairy-tale for jaded Westerners. What would Hindus have thought, had James Cameron turned the Bhagadvad Gita into a 3D action flick? Bertolluci is a very good director, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, he's also a director who takes himself a little too serious at times. Rather than relying on his talent, he tends to ham it up for the greater effect. Why rely on the story and the actors, if you could simply add a more impressive sound and extra color, is the question that Betolluci must have asked himself as he was filming. In essence, that's the difference between good directors like Bertolluci and Coppola, and brilliant directors like Werner Herzog. Now, having mentioned the word "ham", we must now speak of protagonist Keanu Reeves. If the Buddhist ideas of reincarnation are correct, chances are good that Keanu Reeves will be reborn as a ham-sandwich. I clearly recall how the entire cinema broke out in laughter, when Reeves opened his mouth for the first time in "Bram Stokers Dracula", trying to imitate an English accent. When Reeves tried his good luck at an Indian accent, nobody in the cinema was laughing, presumably out of embarrassment. Just my neighbor mumbled the famous Peter Sellers line: "Birdy num-num", summing up all that must be said about Reeves "performance" (and almost causing me to soil my pants). By the end of the film I was thinking about the Islamic creed, which prohibits their prophet from being depicted or heard on any medium. "Little Buddha" would have greatly benefited from a similar policy. 3/10 points because it pains me to give a good director like Bertolluci any less (even though, in the case of "Little Buddha", he would probably have deserved it). Plus, we probably have to thank Bertolluci for making this film before M. Night Shyamalan could get his hands on it (casting himself in the leading role, naturally).

    I don't understand all the haters. This movie was understated and calm because of the subject matter, so what did everyone expect from these actors? Drama? This is an anti-drama film. It's about the birth of Buddhism. And Keanu was delightful as Siddhartha. In fact, from what I read about Keanu Reeves, the person, it is my understanding that he is a lot like this character: polite, soft spoken, sensitive, generous, and highly intelligent, all attributes of an enlightened person. And for those who criticize the acting of Bridget Fonda, having watched most if not all her films, it occurs to me that Ms. Fonda has her own style of acting, which is very understated and natural. She is usually cast in roles that don't showcase her talents, but if anybody ever doubts her abilities, or her versatility, they should watch a film she made where she played an assassin, or an abused wife. In this film, she played a little boy's mother very believably. I do agree Chris Isaak was miscast as her husband. For one thing, Bridget Fonda and Chris Isaak strongly resemble one another and could easily be brother and sister. And Chris Isaak is very wooden in the delivery of his lines, making Ms. Fonda's job more difficult. I found the cinematography beautiful, the music beautiful, and the costumes beautiful. This is my second viewing of the film and I really enjoyed it.

    Little Buddha is in fact a fairly accurate story telling of the belief of reincarnation and the origins of the Buddha. This film is perfect for those who want a place to start learning Buddhism. The clever use of the reincarnation story in an American society rather than a Buddhist one shows how radical reincarnation actually seems to the Western demographic. The notion of reincarnation is further elaborated by the concept of "split rebirths," where one body embodies the mind, other embodies the body, and the last embodies speech. The origin story of the Buddha, Gautama Siddhartha, is told through a storybook towards characters that had close to no knowledge on Buddhism. This method allows audiences, who themselves have might have no knowledge of Buddhism, obtain an understanding of the concepts stated in the film. The characters do a great job of asking questions that audiences might want to know, the concept of reincarnation for example. This film allowed me to gain a better understanding of the concept of reincarnation and the many different forms that it can take (singular or multiple). I highly recommend that people watch this if you want to begin learning Buddhism; it's a good resource of beginning learners.

    Good visuals, but my biggest problem with this movie is the butchered story of Siddhartha Gautama. The changed the story so much and left out important things. Not an extremely accurate retelling of the story. I also don't think Keanu Reeves was a good actor for the part of Siddhartha. This movie is decent for what it is, but if you want an accurate telling of Buddhism and Siddhartha, this isn't the movie you're looking for. I personally believe that the tale of Siddhartha is a beautiful thing that should not be altered and kept true to its origin or it loses its meaning. I also don't think that the true story isn't all that complicated for even children to understand. On a more positive note I was impressed at how true they kept to traditional Tibetan Buddhist beliefs.

    I have been viewing this movie on DVD for 7 years now and I still find it uplifting and enlightening. The story/myth Bertolucci & the script writers wrote mixed the old and the new very effectively. The movie is visually exquisite as is the sound track and score. It is rare to get so much spiritual and philosophical information in a Hollywood movie. I recommend Little Buddha for anyone who is interested in cultural ideas and spirituality. A wonderful family movie. Keanu Reeves makes it a draw and to see him in such a historical role makes it all the more watchable for everyone, not just those interested in Buddhism, Bertolucci, or Keanu Reeves. :)

    Surprisingly terrible film given these same people (Bertolluci for director, Sakamoto for music) made the The Last Emperor. Keanu Reeves is painful to listen to here. He only speaks with an irritating, phoney, attempted Indian accent. Sakamoto made such great music for The Last Emperor that it's one of the few soundtracks I've ever bought. But here, the music didn't move me, and I certainly wasn't rewinding scenes to hear the music again and again. The best aspect of the film is the visual appeal, but even here it's ghoolishly grotesque half the time. Bertolucci uses a cold blue lens for the shots in America, which is depressing, and had me wondering why he's adding this salt to the painful wound he already inflicts on me through the thoughts of two pointless Americans with no appeal or charisma. If I want to feel I'm back in ancient India, where your imagination leads you to see its colours and taste its spice and old world charm, I find reading any children's book of Buddha's life far more enriching and entertaining than this film.

    Berti's soaring effort gets impinged upon by the money guys. Bertolucci's great moment is the unveiling of Keaunu Reeves. Did any man ever look so ahead of his time in 1993? Sadly, though, the business suits are close by, sipping at flasks and nursing coffees, making sure that a layer of heavy sentiment is laid on here, and only a fragmented picture of Siddhartha's progress into divinity there; and the latter treated with exaggerated reverence. It's a shame they didn't make the whole film tell the life of Siddhartha. The rebirth thing is too bizarre and cultish. I'm as at sea with it as the Dad in the mini-family, played by Chris Isaak. Bad news at the business persuades him to take an absurd two-week trip to Nepal with his boy, while Mum grows pregnantly in Seattle, left out of things. Fortunately, the monks find their lama-laddie elsewhere. It's a mixed film but definitely worth seeing for Bertolucci followers.

    I think that this was a strong and powerful movie. It was able to portray many aspects of the Buddhist culture as well as show people the story of the Buddha. This movie is great for people who have little to no knowledge about the Buddhist culture because it gives a great overview and the story line is very interesting. I think it does a good job of mixing in the story of Siddhartha and the storyline of Jesse Conrad. These two stories are really good parallels of each other. Also, I really appreciated the movie because it didn't have those Hollywood stereotypes of a Buddhist monk. Everything was really natural and simple and very easy to understand. Although this movie is somewhat old, I think it still does a good portrayal of the Buddhist culture. People may think that it is outdated, but I think that if one doesn't want to watch a documentary on Buddhism, then they should really watch this movie because along with a great story line of a Buddhist Lama trying to find the reincarnation of his former teacher, it really does give a good background story of Buddhism.

    The little Buddha is about Lama Norbu and other monks seeking the reincarnation of their teacher, Lama Dorje. In their search, the monks believe that the reincarnation of Lama Dorje is in Seattle and is a little boy named Jesse. Jesse is interested in Buddhism, although, does not know much about it. After being hesitant at first when Lama Norbu asks Jesse to return to Bhutan with him, Jesse's father takes Jesse to Bhutan and Nepal. Once there, Jesse meets the other candidates of Lama Norbu's reincarnation, Gita and Raju. Throughout this journey Jesse learns more and more about Buddhism's history and practices with the book Little Buddha. After watching this movie, I learned how seriously monks take reincarnation. Even though Jesse is an outsider of the Buddhist religion, the monks still go through great lengths to find the reincarnation of Lama Norbu and teach Jesse about Buddhism. I also learned that a reincarnation could be broken up into multiple people. In the end, when we figure out that all three of the candidates make up Lama Dorje, we find out that Raju is the body, Gita is speech, and Jesse is his mind. These three aspects of Lama Dorje are also large aspects in Buddhism. I really enjoyed this movie, and could not find any major imperfections. I enjoyed how the movie showed the storybook, Little Buddha, with Siddhartha's life and Jesse's journey. One thing I would have added is more of an ending of what the children decide to do after finding out they make up Lama Dorje, however, chances are all the children wouldn't stay in Bhutan and it is probably better left hanging then having it be a pointless journey. Overall, I think this movie does a good job teaching the viewers about Buddhism, all while bringing the viewers through Jesse's journey. This movie provides a great opportunity for western audiences to learn about Buddhism. Instead of telling you about Siddhartha, this movie shows you who he was and what he did. Not to mention this movie also has a great story line about a boy's journey with Buddhism and Asian cultures.

    A great story, told by an obviously Mahayana Buddhist, where all the mystical elements were applied, but didn't actually take away from the story of Keanu Reeves as the Buddha. I guess that was the only downside for me. Keanu Reeves as the Buddha. I couldn't stop laughing, all I saw when I looked at him in the movie was him playing in Bill & Teds series. "Be excellent to each other". But for real, a good retell of the buddhas life which is what I was looking for when I started watching this movie. I found it interesting that the director chose to through the buddha's whole story in and it compliments well with the present and the little boy in seattle. I think that a lot of Buddhists would enjoy watching this because of the accuracy of the spiritual representation that makes up Buddhism, such as the Mahayana version of buddhas life, as well as how anyone can be the "Buddha" or in this case a "lama", and that's how the connection between the west and the east occur. Very cheesy movie but for those who want to know what Buddhism in its most basic form is all about, I would highly recommend watching it.

    I must admit it: I'm a sucker for fantasy, historic and religious films: be it Lord of the Rings", The Bible" or Conan the Barbarian", I rarely let one pass me by, and so I was pulled into the cinema to see "Little Buddha". In retrospect, the money could have been spent better. The Buddhist faith has always seemed to inspire faith-seeking westerners; after all: the Dalai Lama seems an amiable chap, Richard Gere has done his share in promotion-work and, let's be honest here: the religion has inspired far less war, genocide and general mayhem than other so-called world-religions. However, I cannot imagine many Buddhists being very happy with having Bertolluci turn their faith into a fairy-tale for jaded Westerners. What would Hindus have thought, had James Cameron turned the Bhagadvad Gita into a 3D action flick? Bertolluci is a very good director, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, he's also a director who takes himself a little too serious at times. Rather than relying on his talent, he tends to ham it up for the greater effect. Why rely on the story and the actors, if you could simply add a more impressive sound and extra color, is the question that Betolluci must have asked himself as he was filming. In essence, that's the difference between good directors like Bertolluci and Coppola, and brilliant directors like Werner Herzog. Now, having mentioned the word "ham", we must now speak of protagonist Keanu Reeves. If the Buddhist ideas of reincarnation are correct, chances are good that Keanu Reeves will be reborn as a ham-sandwich. I clearly recall how the entire cinema broke out in laughter, when Reeves opened his mouth for the first time in "Bram Stokers Dracula", trying to imitate an English accent. When Reeves tried his good luck at an Indian accent, nobody in the cinema was laughing, presumably out of embarrassment. Just my neighbor mumbled the famous Peter Sellers line: "Birdy num-num", summing up all that must be said about Reeves "performance" (and almost causing me to soil my pants). By the end of the film I was thinking about the Islamic creed, which prohibits their prophet from being depicted or heard on any medium. "Little Buddha" would have greatly benefited from a similar policy. 3/10 points because it pains me to give a good director like Bertolluci any less (even though, in the case of "Little Buddha", he would probably have deserved it). Plus, we probably have to thank Bertolluci for making this film before M. Night Shyamalan could get his hands on it (casting himself in the leading role, naturally).

    I don't understand all the haters. This movie was understated and calm because of the subject matter, so what did everyone expect from these actors? Drama? This is an anti-drama film. It's about the birth of Buddhism. And Keanu was delightful as Siddhartha. In fact, from what I read about Keanu Reeves, the person, it is my understanding that he is a lot like this character: polite, soft spoken, sensitive, generous, and highly intelligent, all attributes of an enlightened person. And for those who criticize the acting of Bridget Fonda, having watched most if not all her films, it occurs to me that Ms. Fonda has her own style of acting, which is very understated and natural. She is usually cast in roles that don't showcase her talents, but if anybody ever doubts her abilities, or her versatility, they should watch a film she made where she played an assassin, or an abused wife. In this film, she played a little boy's mother very believably. I do agree Chris Isaak was miscast as her husband. For one thing, Bridget Fonda and Chris Isaak strongly resemble one another and could easily be brother and sister. And Chris Isaak is very wooden in the delivery of his lines, making Ms. Fonda's job more difficult. I found the cinematography beautiful, the music beautiful, and the costumes beautiful. This is my second viewing of the film and I really enjoyed it.

    Little Buddha is in fact a fairly accurate story telling of the belief of reincarnation and the origins of the Buddha. This film is perfect for those who want a place to start learning Buddhism. The clever use of the reincarnation story in an American society rather than a Buddhist one shows how radical reincarnation actually seems to the Western demographic. The notion of reincarnation is further elaborated by the concept of "split rebirths," where one body embodies the mind, other embodies the body, and the last embodies speech. The origin story of the Buddha, Gautama Siddhartha, is told through a storybook towards characters that had close to no knowledge on Buddhism. This method allows audiences, who themselves have might have no knowledge of Buddhism, obtain an understanding of the concepts stated in the film. The characters do a great job of asking questions that audiences might want to know, the concept of reincarnation for example. This film allowed me to gain a better understanding of the concept of reincarnation and the many different forms that it can take (singular or multiple). I highly recommend that people watch this if you want to begin learning Buddhism; it's a good resource of beginning learners.

    Good visuals, but my biggest problem with this movie is the butchered story of Siddhartha Gautama. The changed the story so much and left out important things. Not an extremely accurate retelling of the story. I also don't think Keanu Reeves was a good actor for the part of Siddhartha. This movie is decent for what it is, but if you want an accurate telling of Buddhism and Siddhartha, this isn't the movie you're looking for. I personally believe that the tale of Siddhartha is a beautiful thing that should not be altered and kept true to its origin or it loses its meaning. I also don't think that the true story isn't all that complicated for even children to understand. On a more positive note I was impressed at how true they kept to traditional Tibetan Buddhist beliefs.

    I have been viewing this movie on DVD for 7 years now and I still find it uplifting and enlightening. The story/myth Bertolucci & the script writers wrote mixed the old and the new very effectively. The movie is visually exquisite as is the sound track and score. It is rare to get so much spiritual and philosophical information in a Hollywood movie. I recommend Little Buddha for anyone who is interested in cultural ideas and spirituality. A wonderful family movie. Keanu Reeves makes it a draw and to see him in such a historical role makes it all the more watchable for everyone, not just those interested in Buddhism, Bertolucci, or Keanu Reeves. :)

    Surprisingly terrible film given these same people (Bertolluci for director, Sakamoto for music) made the The Last Emperor. Keanu Reeves is painful to listen to here. He only speaks with an irritating, phoney, attempted Indian accent. Sakamoto made such great music for The Last Emperor that it's one of the few soundtracks I've ever bought. But here, the music didn't move me, and I certainly wasn't rewinding scenes to hear the music again and again. The best aspect of the film is the visual appeal, but even here it's ghoolishly grotesque half the time. Bertolucci uses a cold blue lens for the shots in America, which is depressing, and had me wondering why he's adding this salt to the painful wound he already inflicts on me through the thoughts of two pointless Americans with no appeal or charisma. If I want to feel I'm back in ancient India, where your imagination leads you to see its colours and taste its spice and old world charm, I find reading any children's book of Buddha's life far more enriching and entertaining than this film. If you want an interesting intertwining of modern life and the thoughts of Siddharta Gautama, you might find listen to any talk by Ajahn Brahm on Youtube and it'll be far more enriching.

It's a shame they didn't make the whole film tell the life of Siddhartha. The rebirth thing is too bizarre and cultish. I'm as at sea with it as the Dad in the mini-family, played by Chris Isaak. Bad news at the business persuades him to take an absurd two-week trip to Nepal with his boy, while Mum grows pregnantly in Seattle, left out of things. Fortunately, the monks find their lama-laddie elsewhere. It's a mixed film but definitely worth seeing for Bertolucci followers.

    I think that this was a strong and powerful movie. It was able to portray many aspects of the Buddhist culture as well as show people the story of the Buddha. This movie is great for people who have little to no knowledge about the Buddhist culture because it gives a great overview and the story line is very interesting. I think it does a good job of mixing in the story of Siddhartha and the storyline of Jesse Conrad. These two stories are really good parallels of each other. Also, I really appreciated the movie because it didn't have those Hollywood stereotypes of a Buddhist monk. Everything was really natural and simple and very easy to understand. Although this movie is somewhat old, I think it still does a good portrayal of the Buddhist culture. People may think that it is outdated, but I think that if one doesn't want to watch a documentary on Buddhism, then they should really watch this movie because along with a great story line of a Buddhist Lama trying to find the reincarnation of his former teacher, it really does give a good background story of Buddhism.

    The little Buddha is about Lama Norbu and other monks seeking the reincarnation of their teacher, Lama Dorje. In their search, the monks believe that the reincarnation of Lama Dorje is in Seattle and is a little boy named Jesse. Jesse is interested in Buddhism, although, does not know much about it. After being hesitant at first when Lama Norbu asks Jesse to return to Bhutan with him, Jesse's father takes Jesse to Bhutan and Nepal. Once there, Jesse meets the other candidates of Lama Norbu's reincarnation, Gita and Raju. Throughout this journey Jesse learns more and more about Buddhism's history and practices with the book Little Buddha. After watching this movie, I learned how seriously monks take reincarnation. Even though Jesse is an outsider of the Buddhist religion, the monks still go through great lengths to find the reincarnation of Lama Norbu and teach Jesse about Buddhism. I also learned that a reincarnation could be broken up into multiple people. In the end, when we figure out that all three of the candidates make up Lama Dorje, we find out that Raju is the body, Gita is speech, and Jesse is his mind. These three aspects of Lama Dorje are also large aspects in Buddhism. I really enjoyed this movie, and could not find any major imperfections. I enjoyed how the movie showed the storybook, Little Buddha, with Siddhartha's life and Jesse's journey. One thing I would have added is more of an ending of what the children decide to do after finding out they make up Lama Dorje, however, chances are all the children wouldn't stay in Bhutan and it is probably better left hanging then having it be a pointless journey. Overall, I think this movie does a good job teaching the viewers about Buddhism, all while bringing the viewers through Jesse's journey. This movie provides a great opportunity for western audiences to learn about Buddhism. Instead of telling you about Siddhartha, this movie shows you who he was and what he did. Not to mention this movie also has a great story line about a boy's journey with Buddhism and Asian cultures.

    A great story, told by an obviously Mahayana Buddhist, where all the mystical elements were applied, but didn't actually take away from the story of Keanu Reeves as the Buddha. I guess that was the only downside for me. Keanu Reeves as the Buddha. I couldn't stop laughing, all I saw when I looked at him in the movie was him playing in Bill & Teds series. "Be excellent to each other". But for real, a good retell of the buddhas life which is what I was looking for when I started watching this movie. I found it interesting that the director chose to through the buddha's whole story in and it compliments well with the present and the little boy in seattle. I think that a lot of Buddhists would enjoy watching this because of the accuracy of the spiritual representation that makes up Buddhism, such as the Mahayana version of buddhas life, as well as how anyone can be the "Buddha" or in this case a "lama", and that's how the connection between the west and the east occur. Very cheesy movie but for those who want to know what Buddhism in its most basic form is all about, I would highly recommend watching it.

    I must admit it: I'm a sucker for fantasy, historic and religious films: be it Lord of the Rings", The Bible" or Conan the Barbarian", I rarely let one pass me by, and so I was pulled into the cinema to see "Little Buddha". In retrospect, the money could have been spent better. The Buddhist faith has always seemed to inspire faith-seeking westerners; after all: the Dalai Lama seems an amiable chap, Richard Gere has done his share in promotion-work and, let's be honest here: the religion has inspired far less war, genocide and general mayhem than other so-called world-religions. However, I cannot imagine many Buddhists being very happy with having Bertolluci turn their faith into a fairy-tale for jaded Westerners. What would Hindus have thought, had James Cameron turned the Bhagadvad Gita into a 3D action flick? Bertolluci is a very good director, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, he's also a director who takes himself a little too serious at times. Rather than relying on his talent, he tends to ham it up for the greater effect. Why rely on the story and the actors, if you could simply add a more impressive sound and extra color, is the question that Betolluci must have asked himself as he was filming. In essence, that's the difference between good directors like Bertolluci and Coppola, and brilliant directors like Werner Herzog. Now, having mentioned the word "ham", we must now speak of protagonist Keanu Reeves. If the Buddhist ideas of reincarnation are correct, chances are good that Keanu Reeves will be reborn as a ham-sandwich. I clearly recall how the entire cinema broke out in laughter, when Reeves opened his mouth for the first time in "Bram Stokers Dracula", trying to imitate an English accent. When Reeves tried his good luck at an Indian accent, nobody in the cinema was laughing, presumably out of embarrassment. Just my neighbor mumbled the famous Peter Sellers line: "Birdy num-num", summing up all that must be said about Reeves "performance" (and almost causing me to soil my pants). By the end of the film I was thinking about the Islamic creed, which prohibits their prophet from being depicted or heard on any medium. "Little Buddha" would have greatly benefited from a similar policy. 3/10 points because it pains me to give a good director like Bertolluci any less (even though, in the case of "Little Buddha", he would probably have deserved it). Plus, we probably have to thank Bertolluci for making this film before M. Night Shyamalan could get his hands on it (casting himself in the leading role, naturally).

    I don't understand all the haters. This movie was understated and calm because of the subject matter, so what did everyone expect from these actors? Drama? This is an anti-drama film. It's about the birth of Buddhism. And Keanu was delightful as Siddhartha. In fact, from what I read about Keanu Reeves, the person, it is my understanding that he is a lot like this character: polite, soft spoken, sensitive, generous, and highly intelligent, all attributes of an enlightened person. And for those who criticize the acting of Bridget Fonda, having watched most if not all her films, it occurs to me that Ms. Fonda has her own style of acting, which is very understated and natural. She is usually cast in roles that don't showcase her talents, but if anybody ever doubts her abilities, or her versatility, they should watch a film she made where she played an assassin, or an abused wife. In this film, she played a little boy's mother very believably. I do agree Chris Isaak was miscast as her husband. For one thing, Bridget Fonda and Chris Isaak strongly resemble one another and could easily be brother and sister. And Chris Isaak is very wooden in the delivery of his lines, making Ms. Fonda's job more difficult. I found the cinematography beautiful, the music beautiful, and the costumes beautiful. This is my second viewing of the film and I really enjoyed it.

    Little Buddha is in fact a fairly accurate story telling of the belief of reincarnation and the origins of the Buddha. This film is perfect for those who want a place to start learning Buddhism. The clever use of the reincarnation story in an American society rather than a Buddhist one shows how radical reincarnation actually seems to the Western demographic. The notion of reincarnation is further elaborated by the concept of "split rebirths," where one body embodies the mind, other embodies the body, and the last embodies speech. The origin story of the Buddha, Gautama Siddhartha, is told through a storybook towards characters that had close to no knowledge on Buddhism. This method allows audiences, who themselves have might have no knowledge of Buddhism, obtain an understanding of the concepts stated in the film. The characters do a great job of asking questions that audiences might want to know, the concept of reincarnation for example. This film allowed me to gain a better understanding of the concept of reincarnation and the many different forms that it can take (singular or multiple). I highly recommend that people watch this if you want to begin learning Buddhism; it's a good resource of beginning learners.

    Good visuals, but my biggest problem with this movie is the butchered story of Siddhartha Gautama. The changed the story so much and left out important things. Not an extremely accurate retelling of the story. I also don't think Keanu Reeves was a good actor for the part of Siddhartha. This movie is decent for what it is, but if you want an accurate telling of Buddhism and Siddhartha, this isn't the movie you're looking for. I personally believe that the tale of Siddhartha is a beautiful thing that should not be altered and kept true to its origin or it loses its meaning. I also don't think that the true story isn't all that complicated for even children to understand. On a more positive note I was impressed at how true they kept to traditional Tibetan Buddhist beliefs.

    I have been viewing this movie on DVD for 7 years now and I still find it uplifting and enlightening. The story/myth Bertolucci & the script writers wrote mixed the old and the new very effectively. The movie is visually exquisite as is the sound track and score. It is rare to get so much spiritual and philosophical information in a Hollywood movie. I recommend Little Buddha for anyone who is interested in cultural ideas and spirituality. A wonderful family movie. Keanu Reeves makes it a draw and to see him in such a historical role makes it all the more watchable for everyone, not just those interested in Buddhism, Bertolucci, or Keanu Reeves. :)

    Surprisingly terrible film given these same people (Bertolluci for director, Sakamoto for music) made the The Last Emperor. Keanu Reeves is painful to listen to here. He only speaks with an irritating, phoney, attempted Indian accent. Sakamoto made such great music for The Last Emperor that it's one of the few soundtracks I've ever bought. But here, the music didn't move me, and I certainly wasn't rewinding scenes to hear the music again and again. The best aspect of the film is the visual appeal, but even here it's ghoolishly grotesque half the time. Bertolucci uses a cold blue lens for the shots in America, which is depressing, and had me wondering why he's adding this salt to the painful wound he already inflicts on me through the thoughts of two pointless Americans with no appeal or charisma. If I want to feel I'm back in ancient India, where your imagination leads you to see its colours and taste its spice and old world charm, I find reading any children's book of Buddha's life far more enriching and entertaining than this film. If you want an interesting intertwining of modern life and the thoughts of Siddharta Gautama, you might find listen to any talk by Ajahn Brahm on Youtube and it'll be far more enriching.
