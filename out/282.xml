 <sinopse>
  A young lawyer defends a black man accused of murdering two men who raped his 10-year-old daughter, sparking a rebirth of the KKK.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In Canton, Mississippi, 10-year-old Tonya Hailey is viciously brutalized by two white racist rednecks -- James Louis "Pete" Willard and Billy Ray Cobb. Almost immediately after Tonya is found and rushed to a hospital, Pete and Billy Ray are found at a roadside bar, where they had been bragging about what they did to Tonya. Tonya's understandably distraught and enraged father, Carl Lee Hailey, remembers a case from a year ago, when four white men raped an African-American girl in a nearby town, and got acquitted. Carl is determined to not let that happen in this case. While deputy Dwayne Powell Looney is escorting Pete and Billy Ray up a flight of stairs to a court room, Carl emerges from the building's basement with an assault rifle, and he kills Pete and Billy Ray for what they did to Tonya. Carl is later arrested at his house by African-American sheriff Ozzie Walls, and Carl is scheduled to be placed on trial. Despite the efforts of the NAACP and local African-American leaders to ...

    I read the book before I watched the movie. I was disappointed how the movie left out so much detail from the book, or they changed how things happened. Changing these details affected the movie. I know you can't get all of the detail from the book into the movie, especially if you want it a reasonable length, but I feel they focused on unimportant parts, and left out important ones. I feel that I would have appreciated the movie more if I watched it before reading the book. I found myself constantly thinking about how they changed things or completely left them out, instead of being able to fully enjoy the movie.

    First of all I want to say I've seen a number of good films which are great illustrations of racial injustice, and that I was moved by. It is without a doubt a stain on the history of our nation. However, this wasn't one of them. I think its entirely over the top for the times that it was set in. To me it promotes racial division rather than harmony, as well as vigilante justice. I can't envision any prosecutor in the 1990's seeking the gas chamber and first degree murder charges against Carl Lee, nor the reprehensible acts of the two lowlifes who raped his daughter to spark the rebirth of a KKK to defend them or want to avenge their deaths. Yes there will always be idiot racists and lunatic fringe groups, but the fabric of society in this movie would have been a lot more believable had it been set in the 60's. Matthew McConaughey overacted and like many of the others seemed afflicted with a case of sort of over the top white guilt, Sandra Bullock's character was completely pointless and just seemed to be forced into the movie for eye candy purposes, Samuel L Jackson was good portraying a sympathetic character....... but overall it was more everyone's response to the situation that derailed this movie and made it an overdone and overdramatized picture of race relations in 1990's America.

    It is a well made movie, and the acting is generally O.K., but in the Law I know...Samuel Jacksons character..HAD TO BE..found guilty. The McConaughey speech at the end , was very week. By that time, the Director Joel Schmacher must have thought he had his audience in the palm of his hand, so not much thought was put into the most important part of the movie. It is a movie that sets out to say a lot, yet in the end ...we know things wont change in the U. S. of A. I felt i had watched this type of manipulative film many times (and i have)...we all have. The year it is portraying really does not matter. What matters is ...does anyone believe this ? And if you do, you must ask yourself.....WHY..?? (when it is clearly a million miles away from reality).

    A Time to Kill (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Set in a racist South, a young lawyer (Matthew McConaughey) takes the case of a black man (Samuel L. Jackson) who murdered the two white men who raped his ten-year-old daughter. Soon the lawyer comes under attack from the KKK while at the same time he tries to find a way to get his client off. There are certainly flaws to be found in this film but for a mainstream courtroom drama I think it offers enough that makes it highly entertaining. We could debate the political issues in the story for years but I'll freely admit that I agree with what Jackson's character did. I think what makes this film so entertaining is that we're given some very memorable characters and the actors do a terrific job bringing them to life. McConaughey easily became a star thanks to this film and I think he showed a great talent as he really nailed this character and the various emotions that he goes through. Jackson is also very good in his part as the sympathetic father and Sandra Bullock is also terrific in her role as a woman trying to help the case. Donald Sutherland is also very memorable in his supporting role as is his son Kiefer who plays a racist. Kevin Spacey, Oliver Platt, Charles S. Dutton, Brenda Flicker Chris Cooper and Ashley Judd are also very good in their roles. The story itself is one that could cause a heated debate but I thought for the most part it was professionally told by director Joel Schumacher. With that said, I think the director creates some rather not-so-good moments including a few silly close-ups and over-dramatic moments that happen with them. Take a look at the evil juror who wants to fry the Jackson character and during one scene he says something bad and we get a cheap thunder sound effect. Another thing that keeps the film from being perfect is how evil everyone is. I mean there's an evil cop, a cheating D.A., a crooked judge and just about everyone else is guilty of something. I think the story was strong enough without having everyone being dirty of something. At a minute short of 150-minutes, the film runs on a bit too long but thankfully the performances and story are strong enough to carry most of it. A TIME TO KILL is certainly far from perfect but it's certainly entertainment at its highest level.

    I found and read some comments about this movie before watching that this movie is cheap and tasteless, after that I lost interest to watch. But I got more positive comments and finally watched it. Don't know how someone can use words 'cheap and tasteless' about this movie, but I strongly recommend that just watch before reading so many comments. This movie has a strong theme, some fine acting (specially, Matthew McConaughey) and nice screen playing. It would take almost 150 minutes of your time but I think, you should remember this movie for long time after watching.

    Sometimes on IMDb, reviewers take the movies too seriously. They analyze the plot development and plausibility and compare on-screen characters with real life examples such as their next door neighbors or as in the case of "A Time to Kill" the people of the American South. The movie was based on a John Grisham novel of the same name, and this author has become famous for writing engrossing legal thrillers with memorable characters. "A Time to Kill" was one of his more sensational novels and tugs on the heart strings more than the rest, such as "The Client" or "The Rainmaker." Joel Schumacher directed, which gives the movie a popcorn entertainment, comic-book feel. After all, this is the same guy who directed the first two "Men in Black" movies and "Batman Forever/Batman and Robin." He manages to create some stirring images, such as when Carl Lee carries his bloodied daughter Tanya out the front door of the house and toward the ambulance, with the whole neighborhood looking on. Yes, we know that such a thing would never happen in real life (paramedics would have put her on a gurney in the living room) but the anguish and rage on Carl Lee's (Samuel L. Jackson) face packs a wallop. Charles S. Dutton shows the world he can be a tough hombre in his role as Sheriff Walls, an ex NFL player for the Rams. Another powerful scene shows him invading a bar to collect the two boys who have raped and ravaged Tanya. And after Carl Lee has murdered the two boys who have damaged his daughter, Sheriff Walls wearily leads a police motorcade to Carl Lee's house, where the only dialog is "See you Gwen." This movie contains the first major role for Matthew McConnaughey and an Oscar-worthy performance from Kevin Spacey as Rufus Buckley a DA with gubernatorial aspirations. Sparks fly from the screen because of the sexual chemistry between McConnaughey and Sandra Bullock, who plays Ellen Roark, an idealistic law student who volunteers to help with the case. Other surprises include a delightful turn from Oliver Platt as a caddish southern divorce lawyer and Jake Brigance's (McConnaughey) close friend. In other directorial hands, the movie could have been a simple courtroom drama, but Joel Schumacher emphasizes the subplot of the rise of the "new" Ku Klux Klan as a response to the murder of the two boys by a black man. The Klan violently clashes with the townsfolk, a whole National Guard battalion gets called in and "A Time to Kill" ends up filled with the most action ever for a John Grisham adaptation. Of course, the ending satisfies, too. This is the kind of movie that can be watched over and over again the way an intricate painting can be enjoyed over and over again.

    A Time to Kill (1996) What a powerful movie. Yes, it's built on movie-making clich&eacute;s, it manipulates the viewer, and there are excesses and improbabilities. And yes, in fact, it is on some level kind of trashy. But it's extremely well made trash in the hands of director Joel Schumacher. And when you deal with contemporary race relations in Mississippi through a capital murder trial you end up at the extremes of society. All of what happens here makes sense and reveals some remaining strains of bigotry, violence, and personal blindness in society. I don't like the underlying moral logic much, but if you can appreciate American vigilante revenge (I can't, even though it happens in a lot of convincing movies), you'll click with the message here, too. It might slightly help to remember this made a little more sense in 1996. Or maybe 1986, which is when the book was being written. Oddly, and wonderfully, the movie feels like something that wouldn't happen in 2013, when I saw it. Maybe in some ways all of this could still take similar vague form, and I have not doubt about racism being alive in kicking in many places around the country, but what happens here is meant to be the vestiges from 20 years ago of what was once commonplace in the south. Hopefully last vestiges. A cinematic strength here beyond the story of a black man in an essentially white justice system is the rich cast. There are something like seven major stars in various roles, from Matthew McConaughey as the leading defense lawyer who does a good job to Ashley Judd as his wife who isn't given much to do or say and who is surprisingly canned. There is Donald Sutherland as the wise renegade (and disbarred) old lawyer who helps from the background (rather like Preminger's 1959 "Anatomy of Murder") and his son Kiefer as a crazed neo-KKK bigot with a quick tendency to cruelty. Somewhere between is the perp and eventual hero to some played with decent intensity by Samuel L. Jackson, and the bright smart-alecky law clerk in the form of Sandra Bullock. Throw in Kevin Spacey as the haughty D.A and Patrick McGoohan of all people (he's the lead in the great 1960s t.v. series, "The Prisoner") as the judge. Both are terrific. Expect lots of interwoven plots, lots of violence against lots of innocent people, and some speechmaking about how to achieve justice and find the best in people. The movie is designed to make you approve of the revenge killings near the start of the movie, revenge by a father after the brutal rape and torture of his 10 year old daughter. The key defense hinges on the idea that any father would have done the same. It's "justifiable homicide." But to appreciate this is to turn a blind eye to the fact that there might never be such a thing as justifiable homicide. I mean, that's what lynching is based on--and so what one person calls justified is what another calls senseless vendetta-based murderous sin. And the underlying message is that if someone commits a bad enough crime they deserve to die. Without a trial. This is what drives the movie and makes you take sides. It's almost impossible to side with the prosecutor, who makes the simple case that you don't kill people in cold blood in our society. But the common folk of the jury are all twelve swayed in the final four minutes by a heartwrenching and unlikely speech by our young lawyer hero. The KKK finds its comeuppance. The new South is apparently just starting to see the problem with its centuries of racism. The more I write the more I realize the movie is almost shameful. But a well-acted, well directed bit of movie-making shame. Yes it's worth seeing, no matter which side of the morality you are on. It is, to be sure, by the same director who gave us "Falling Down," if you remember that other justification of revenge violence. It is also, luckily, a condemnation of racism in many forms. See it, but give it some thought.

    Although I enjoyed it, I did find this film way too long. It gets lost in too much detail part way through and there is an awful lot of stuff in there that has very little baring on the case in hand. I did also find it a little predictable in places, but then I have seen a few Grisham adaptations and they do tend to follow a similar pattern. As a revenge thriller, it's not all that good, but as a courtroom drama, I found it quite riveting. It's still quite an enjoyable watch, films about justice generally are (I find) and so I can just about deem it RECOMMENDED (even if it's a tad long). My score: 6.5/10 IMDb Score: 7.1/10 (based on 51,195 votes at the time of going to press). MetaScore: 54/100: (Based on 21 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 67/100 (based on 51 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 59/100 'Want to See' (based on 88,981 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

    On what planet does this movie take place? Because it certainly isn't earth. Apparently on this planet, all Southerners are sadistic, racist pigs who delight in hurting other people. Also in this universe, it's OK for a black man to kill two white men if he believes they might get off for the crime they committed, and that everyone who tries to get him off is a hero. Anyone who wants him in jail is racist. Typical extremist liberal schlock with no connection to reality. People who like this movie are the same type of people who think a cop killer like Mumia Abu Jamal should go free, simply because he's black. Don't watch this movie.

    John Grisham novels always have been handled with great respect by Hollywood, and TIME is no exception. An all-star cast and a top-flight director tell the story of a young southern lawyer who defends a black man accused of killing two white men who raped his 10-year-old daughter. Tempers flare, the KKK is reborn and people start getting hurt and dying. Expert witnesses turn out not to be so expert and the young lawyer's house is burned to the ground. The suspense is in high gear throughout, and the script is powerfully written. Matthew M., Sam Jackson, Keifer and Donald Sutherland and Sandra Bullock pull out all the stops. You'll feel like you're right there with them. While the discerning viewer may not buy the saccharine ending -- I sure as hell did not -- the movie nevertheless will sweep you up in its intensity.

Maybe in some ways all of this could still take similar vague form, and I have not doubt about racism being alive in kicking in many places around the country, but what happens here is meant to be the vestiges from 20 years ago of what was once commonplace in the south. Hopefully last vestiges. A cinematic strength here beyond the story of a black man in an essentially white justice system is the rich cast. There are something like seven major stars in various roles, from Matthew McConaughey as the leading defense lawyer who does a good job to Ashley Judd as his wife who isn't given much to do or say and who is surprisingly canned. There is Donald Sutherland as the wise renegade (and disbarred) old lawyer who helps from the background (rather like Preminger's 1959 "Anatomy of Murder") and his son Kiefer as a crazed neo-KKK bigot with a quick tendency to cruelty. Somewhere between is the perp and eventual hero to some played with decent intensity by Samuel L. Jackson, and the bright smart-alecky law clerk in the form of Sandra Bullock. Throw in Kevin Spacey as the haughty D.A and Patrick McGoohan of all people (he's the lead in the great 1960s t.v. series, "The Prisoner") as the judge. Both are terrific. Expect lots of interwoven plots, lots of violence against lots of innocent people, and some speechmaking about how to achieve justice and find the best in people. The movie is designed to make you approve of the revenge killings near the start of the movie, revenge by a father after the brutal rape and torture of his 10 year old daughter. The key defense hinges on the idea that any father would have done the same. It's "justifiable homicide." But to appreciate this is to turn a blind eye to the fact that there might never be such a thing as justifiable homicide. I mean, that's what lynching is based on--and so what one person calls justified is what another calls senseless vendetta-based murderous sin. And the underlying message is that if someone commits a bad enough crime they deserve to die. Without a trial. This is what drives the movie and makes you take sides. It's almost impossible to side with the prosecutor, who makes the simple case that you don't kill people in cold blood in our society. But the common folk of the jury are all twelve swayed in the final four minutes by a heartwrenching and unlikely speech by our young lawyer hero. The KKK finds its comeuppance. The new South is apparently just starting to see the problem with its centuries of racism. The more I write the more I realize the movie is almost shameful. But a well-acted, well directed bit of movie-making shame. Yes it's worth seeing, no matter which side of the morality you are on. It is, to be sure, by the same director who gave us "Falling Down," if you remember that other justification of revenge violence. It is also, luckily, a condemnation of racism in many forms. See it, but give it some thought.

    Although I enjoyed it, I did find this film way too long. It gets lost in too much detail part way through and there is an awful lot of stuff in there that has very little baring on the case in hand. I did also find it a little predictable in places, but then I have seen a few Grisham adaptations and they do tend to follow a similar pattern. As a revenge thriller, it's not all that good, but as a courtroom drama, I found it quite riveting. It's still quite an enjoyable watch, films about justice generally are (I find) and so I can just about deem it RECOMMENDED (even if it's a tad long). My score: 6.5/10 IMDb Score: 7.1/10 (based on 51,195 votes at the time of going to press). MetaScore: 54/100: (Based on 21 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 67/100 (based on 51 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

    On what planet does this movie take place? Because it certainly isn't earth. Apparently on this planet, all Southerners are sadistic, racist pigs who delight in hurting other people. Also in this universe, it's OK for a black man to kill two white men if he believes they might get off for the crime they committed, and that everyone who tries to get him off is a hero. Anyone who wants him in jail is racist. Typical extremist liberal schlock with no connection to reality. People who like this movie are the same type of people who think a cop killer like Mumia Abu Jamal should go free, simply because he's black. Don't watch this movie.

    John Grisham novels always have been handled with great respect by Hollywood, and TIME is no exception. An all-star cast and a top-flight director tell the story of a young southern lawyer who defends a black man accused of killing two white men who raped his 10-year-old daughter. Tempers flare, the KKK is reborn and people start getting hurt and dying. Expert witnesses turn out not to be so expert and the young lawyer's house is burned to the ground. The suspense is in high gear throughout, and the script is powerfully written. Matthew M., Sam Jackson, Keifer and Donald Sutherland and Sandra Bullock pull out all the stops. You'll feel like you're right there with them. While the discerning viewer may not buy the saccharine ending -- I sure as hell did not -- the movie nevertheless will sweep you up in its intensity.

    I read the book before I watched the movie. I was disappointed how the movie left out so much detail from the book, or they changed how things happened. Changing these details affected the movie. I know you can't get all of the detail from the book into the movie, especially if you want it a reasonable length, but I feel they focused on unimportant parts, and left out important ones. I feel that I would have appreciated the movie more if I watched it before reading the book. I found myself constantly thinking about how they changed things or completely left them out, instead of being able to fully enjoy the movie.

    First of all I want to say I've seen a number of good films which are great illustrations of racial injustice, and that I was moved by. It is without a doubt a stain on the history of our nation. However, this wasn't one of them. I think its entirely over the top for the times that it was set in. To me it promotes racial division rather than harmony, as well as vigilante justice. I can't envision any prosecutor in the 1990's seeking the gas chamber and first degree murder charges against Carl Lee, nor the reprehensible acts of the two lowlifes who raped his daughter to spark the rebirth of a KKK to defend them or want to avenge their deaths. Yes there will always be idiot racists and lunatic fringe groups, but the fabric of society in this movie would have been a lot more believable had it been set in the 60's. Matthew McConaughey overacted and like many of the others seemed afflicted with a case of sort of over the top white guilt, Sandra Bullock's character was completely pointless and just seemed to be forced into the movie for eye candy purposes, Samuel L Jackson was good portraying a sympathetic character....... but overall it was more everyone's response to the situation that derailed this movie and made it an overdone and overdramatized picture of race relations in 1990's America.

    It is a well made movie, and the acting is generally O.K., but in the Law I know...Samuel Jacksons character..HAD TO BE..found guilty. The McConaughey speech at the end , was very week. By that time, the Director Joel Schmacher must have thought he had his audience in the palm of his hand, so not much thought was put into the most important part of the movie. It is a movie that sets out to say a lot, yet in the end ...we know things wont change in the U. S. of A. I felt i had watched this type of manipulative film many times (and i have)...we all have. The year it is portraying really does not matter. What matters is ...does anyone believe this ? And if you do, you must ask yourself.....WHY..?? (when it is clearly a million miles away from reality).

    A Time to Kill (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Set in a racist South, a young lawyer (Matthew McConaughey) takes the case of a black man (Samuel L. Jackson) who murdered the two white men who raped his ten-year-old daughter. Soon the lawyer comes under attack from the KKK while at the same time he tries to find a way to get his client off. There are certainly flaws to be found in this film but for a mainstream courtroom drama I think it offers enough that makes it highly entertaining. We could debate the political issues in the story for years but I'll freely admit that I agree with what Jackson's character did. I think what makes this film so entertaining is that we're given some very memorable characters and the actors do a terrific job bringing them to life. McConaughey easily became a star thanks to this film and I think he showed a great talent as he really nailed this character and the various emotions that he goes through. Jackson is also very good in his part as the sympathetic father and Sandra Bullock is also terrific in her role as a woman trying to help the case. Donald Sutherland is also very memorable in his supporting role as is his son Kiefer who plays a racist. Kevin Spacey, Oliver Platt, Charles S. Dutton, Brenda Flicker Chris Cooper and Ashley Judd are also very good in their roles. The story itself is one that could cause a heated debate but I thought for the most part it was professionally told by director Joel Schumacher. With that said, I think the director creates some rather not-so-good moments including a few silly close-ups and over-dramatic moments that happen with them. Take a look at the evil juror who wants to fry the Jackson character and during one scene he says something bad and we get a cheap thunder sound effect. Another thing that keeps the film from being perfect is how evil everyone is. I mean there's an evil cop, a cheating D.A., a crooked judge and just about everyone else is guilty of something. I think the story was strong enough without having everyone being dirty of something. At a minute short of 150-minutes, the film runs on a bit too long but thankfully the performances and story are strong enough to carry most of it. A TIME TO KILL is certainly far from perfect but it's certainly entertainment at its highest level.

    I found and read some comments about this movie before watching that this movie is cheap and tasteless, after that I lost interest to watch. But I got more positive comments and finally watched it. Don't know how someone can use words 'cheap and tasteless' about this movie, but I strongly recommend that just watch before reading so many comments. This movie has a strong theme, some fine acting (specially, Matthew McConaughey) and nice screen playing. It would take almost 150 minutes of your time but I think, you should remember this movie for long time after watching.

    Sometimes on IMDb, reviewers take the movies too seriously. They analyze the plot development and plausibility and compare on-screen characters with real life examples such as their next door neighbors or as in the case of "A Time to Kill" the people of the American South. The movie was based on a John Grisham novel of the same name, and this author has become famous for writing engrossing legal thrillers with memorable characters. "A Time to Kill" was one of his more sensational novels and tugs on the heart strings more than the rest, such as "The Client" or "The Rainmaker." Joel Schumacher directed, which gives the movie a popcorn entertainment, comic-book feel. After all, this is the same guy who directed the first two "Men in Black" movies and "Batman Forever/Batman and Robin." He manages to create some stirring images, such as when Carl Lee carries his bloodied daughter Tanya out the front door of the house and toward the ambulance, with the whole neighborhood looking on. Yes, we know that such a thing would never happen in real life (paramedics would have put her on a gurney in the living room) but the anguish and rage on Carl Lee's (Samuel L. Jackson) face packs a wallop. Charles S. Dutton shows the world he can be a tough hombre in his role as Sheriff Walls, an ex NFL player for the Rams. Another powerful scene shows him invading a bar to collect the two boys who have raped and ravaged Tanya. And after Carl Lee has murdered the two boys who have damaged his daughter, Sheriff Walls wearily leads a police motorcade to Carl Lee's house, where the only dialog is "See you Gwen." This movie contains the first major role for Matthew McConnaughey and an Oscar-worthy performance from Kevin Spacey as Rufus Buckley a DA with gubernatorial aspirations. Sparks fly from the screen because of the sexual chemistry between McConnaughey and Sandra Bullock, who plays Ellen Roark, an idealistic law student who volunteers to help with the case. Other surprises include a delightful turn from Oliver Platt as a caddish southern divorce lawyer and Jake Brigance's (McConnaughey) close friend. In other directorial hands, the movie could have been a simple courtroom drama, but Joel Schumacher emphasizes the subplot of the rise of the "new" Ku Klux Klan as a response to the murder of the two boys by a black man. The Klan violently clashes with the townsfolk, a whole National Guard battalion gets called in and "A Time to Kill" ends up filled with the most action ever for a John Grisham adaptation. Of course, the ending satisfies, too. This is the kind of movie that can be watched over and over again the way an intricate painting can be enjoyed over and over again.

    A Time to Kill (1996) What a powerful movie. Yes, it's built on movie-making clich&eacute;s, it manipulates the viewer, and there are excesses and improbabilities. And yes, in fact, it is on some level kind of trashy. But it's extremely well made trash in the hands of director Joel Schumacher. And when you deal with contemporary race relations in Mississippi through a capital murder trial you end up at the extremes of society. All of what happens here makes sense and reveals some remaining strains of bigotry, violence, and personal blindness in society. I don't like the underlying moral logic much, but if you can appreciate American vigilante revenge (I can't, even though it happens in a lot of convincing movies), you'll click with the message here, too. It might slightly help to remember this made a little more sense in 1996. Or maybe 1986, which is when the book was being written. Oddly, and wonderfully, the movie feels like something that wouldn't happen in 2013, when I saw it. Maybe in some ways all of this could still take similar vague form, and I have not doubt about racism being alive in kicking in many places around the country, but what happens here is meant to be the vestiges from 20 years ago of what was once commonplace in the south. Hopefully last vestiges. A cinematic strength here beyond the story of a black man in an essentially white justice system is the rich cast. There are something like seven major stars in various roles, from Matthew McConaughey as the leading defense lawyer who does a good job to Ashley Judd as his wife who isn't given much to do or say and who is surprisingly canned. There is Donald Sutherland as the wise renegade (and disbarred) old lawyer who helps from the background (rather like Preminger's 1959 "Anatomy of Murder") and his son Kiefer as a crazed neo-KKK bigot with a quick tendency to cruelty. Somewhere between is the perp and eventual hero to some played with decent intensity by Samuel L. Jackson, and the bright smart-alecky law clerk in the form of Sandra Bullock. Throw in Kevin Spacey as the haughty D.A and Patrick McGoohan of all people (he's the lead in the great 1960s t.v. series, "The Prisoner") as the judge. Both are terrific. Expect lots of interwoven plots, lots of violence against lots of innocent people, and some speechmaking about how to achieve justice and find the best in people. The movie is designed to make you approve of the revenge killings near the start of the movie, revenge by a father after the brutal rape and torture of his 10 year old daughter. The key defense hinges on the idea that any father would have done the same. It's "justifiable homicide."

The new South is apparently just starting to see the problem with its centuries of racism. The more I write the more I realize the movie is almost shameful. But a well-acted, well directed bit of movie-making shame. Yes it's worth seeing, no matter which side of the morality you are on. It is, to be sure, by the same director who gave us "Falling Down," if you remember that other justification of revenge violence. It is also, luckily, a condemnation of racism in many forms. See it, but give it some thought.

    Sometimes on IMDb, reviewers take the movies too seriously. They analyze the plot development and plausibility and compare on-screen characters with real life examples such as their next door neighbors or as in the case of "A Time to Kill" the people of the American South. The movie was based on a John Grisham novel of the same name, and this author has become famous for writing engrossing legal thrillers with memorable characters. "A Time to Kill" was one of his more sensational novels and tugs on the heart strings more than the rest, such as "The Client" or "The Rainmaker." Joel Schumacher directed, which gives the movie a popcorn entertainment, comic-book feel. After all, this is the same guy who directed the first two "Men in Black" movies and "Batman Forever/Batman and Robin." He manages to create some stirring images, such as when Carl Lee carries his bloodied daughter Tanya out the front door of the house and toward the ambulance, with the whole neighborhood looking on. Yes, we know that such a thing would never happen in real life (paramedics would have put her on a gurney in the living room) but the anguish and rage on Carl Lee's (Samuel L. Jackson) face packs a wallop. Charles S. Dutton shows the world he can be a tough hombre in his role as Sheriff Walls, an ex NFL player for the Rams. Another powerful scene shows him invading a bar to collect the two boys who have raped and ravaged Tanya. And after Carl Lee has murdered the two boys who have damaged his daughter, Sheriff Walls wearily leads a police motorcade to Carl Lee's house, where the only dialog is "See you Gwen." This movie contains the first major role for Matthew McConnaughey and an Oscar-worthy performance from Kevin Spacey as Rufus Buckley a DA with gubernatorial aspirations. Sparks fly from the screen because of the sexual chemistry between McConnaughey and Sandra Bullock, who plays Ellen Roark, an idealistic law student who volunteers to help with the case. Other surprises include a delightful turn from Oliver Platt as a caddish southern divorce lawyer and Jake Brigance's (McConnaughey) close friend. In other directorial hands, the movie could have been a simple courtroom drama, but Joel Schumacher emphasizes the subplot of the rise of the "new" Ku Klux Klan as a response to the murder of the two boys by a black man. The Klan violently clashes with the townsfolk, a whole National Guard battalion gets called in and "A Time to Kill" ends up filled with the most action ever for a John Grisham adaptation. Of course, the ending satisfies, too. This is the kind of movie that can be watched over and over again the way an intricate painting can be enjoyed over and over again.

    A Time to Kill (1996) What a powerful movie. Yes, it's built on movie-making clich&eacute;s, it manipulates the viewer, and there are excesses and improbabilities. And yes, in fact, it is on some level kind of trashy. But it's extremely well made trash in the hands of director Joel Schumacher. And when you deal with contemporary race relations in Mississippi through a capital murder trial you end up at the extremes of society. All of what happens here makes sense and reveals some remaining strains of bigotry, violence, and personal blindness in society. I don't like the underlying moral logic much, but if you can appreciate American vigilante revenge (I can't, even though it happens in a lot of convincing movies), you'll click with the message here, too. It might slightly help to remember this made a little more sense in 1996. Or maybe 1986, which is when the book was being written. Oddly, and wonderfully, the movie feels like something that wouldn't happen in 2013, when I saw it. Maybe in some ways all of this could still take similar vague form, and I have not doubt about racism being alive in kicking in many places around the country, but what happens here is meant to be the vestiges from 20 years ago of what was once commonplace in the south. Hopefully last vestiges. A cinematic strength here beyond the story of a black man in an essentially white justice system is the rich cast. There are something like seven major stars in various roles, from Matthew McConaughey as the leading defense lawyer who does a good job to Ashley Judd as his wife who isn't given much to do or say and who is surprisingly canned. There is Donald Sutherland as the wise renegade (and disbarred) old lawyer who helps from the background (rather like Preminger's 1959 "Anatomy of Murder") and his son Kiefer as a crazed neo-KKK bigot with a quick tendency to cruelty. Somewhere between is the perp and eventual hero to some played with decent intensity by Samuel L. Jackson, and the bright smart-alecky law clerk in the form of Sandra Bullock. Throw in Kevin Spacey as the haughty D.A and Patrick McGoohan of all people (he's the lead in the great 1960s t.v. series, "The Prisoner") as the judge. Both are terrific. Expect lots of interwoven plots, lots of violence against lots of innocent people, and some speechmaking about how to achieve justice and find the best in people. The movie is designed to make you approve of the revenge killings near the start of the movie, revenge by a father after the brutal rape and torture of his 10 year old daughter. The key defense hinges on the idea that any father would have done the same. It's "justifiable homicide." But to appreciate this is to turn a blind eye to the fact that there might never be such a thing as justifiable homicide. I mean, that's what lynching is based on--and so what one person calls justified is what another calls senseless vendetta-based murderous sin. And the underlying message is that if someone commits a bad enough crime they deserve to die. Without a trial. This is what drives the movie and makes you take sides. It's almost impossible to side with the prosecutor, who makes the simple case that you don't kill people in cold blood in our society. But the common folk of the jury are all twelve swayed in the final four minutes by a heartwrenching and unlikely speech by our young lawyer hero. The KKK finds its comeuppance. The new South is apparently just starting to see the problem with its centuries of racism. The more I write the more I realize the movie is almost shameful. But a well-acted, well directed bit of movie-making shame. Yes it's worth seeing, no matter which side of the morality you are on. It is, to be sure, by the same director who gave us "Falling Down," if you remember that other justification of revenge violence. It is also, luckily, a condemnation of racism in many forms. See it, but give it some thought.

    Although I enjoyed it, I did find this film way too long. It gets lost in too much detail part way through and there is an awful lot of stuff in there that has very little baring on the case in hand. I did also find it a little predictable in places, but then I have seen a few Grisham adaptations and they do tend to follow a similar pattern. As a revenge thriller, it's not all that good, but as a courtroom drama, I found it quite riveting. It's still quite an enjoyable watch, films about justice generally are (I find) and so I can just about deem it RECOMMENDED (even if it's a tad long). My score: 6.5/10 IMDb Score: 7.1/10 (based on 51,195 votes at the time of going to press). MetaScore: 54/100: (Based on 21 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 67/100 (based on 51 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 59/100 'Want to See' (based on 88,981 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

    On what planet does this movie take place? Because it certainly isn't earth. Apparently on this planet, all Southerners are sadistic, racist pigs who delight in hurting other people. Also in this universe, it's OK for a black man to kill two white men if he believes they might get off for the crime they committed, and that everyone who tries to get him off is a hero. Anyone who wants him in jail is racist. Typical extremist liberal schlock with no connection to reality. People who like this movie are the same type of people who think a cop killer like Mumia Abu Jamal should go free, simply because he's black. Don't watch this movie.

    John Grisham novels always have been handled with great respect by Hollywood, and TIME is no exception. An all-star cast and a top-flight director tell the story of a young southern lawyer who defends a black man accused of killing two white men who raped his 10-year-old daughter. Tempers flare, the KKK is reborn and people start getting hurt and dying. Expert witnesses turn out not to be so expert and the young lawyer's house is burned to the ground. The suspense is in high gear throughout, and the script is powerfully written. Matthew M., Sam Jackson, Keifer and Donald Sutherland and Sandra Bullock pull out all the stops. You'll feel like you're right there with them. While the discerning viewer may not buy the saccharine ending -- I sure as hell did not -- the movie nevertheless will sweep you up in its intensity.

    I read the book before I watched the movie. I was disappointed how the movie left out so much detail from the book, or they changed how things happened. Changing these details affected the movie. I know you can't get all of the detail from the book into the movie, especially if you want it a reasonable length, but I feel they focused on unimportant parts, and left out important ones. I feel that I would have appreciated the movie more if I watched it before reading the book. I found myself constantly thinking about how they changed things or completely left them out, instead of being able to fully enjoy the movie.

    First of all I want to say I've seen a number of good films which are great illustrations of racial injustice, and that I was moved by. It is without a doubt a stain on the history of our nation. However, this wasn't one of them. I think its entirely over the top for the times that it was set in. To me it promotes racial division rather than harmony, as well as vigilante justice. I can't envision any prosecutor in the 1990's seeking the gas chamber and first degree murder charges against Carl Lee, nor the reprehensible acts of the two lowlifes who raped his daughter to spark the rebirth of a KKK to defend them or want to avenge their deaths. Yes there will always be idiot racists and lunatic fringe groups, but the fabric of society in this movie would have been a lot more believable had it been set in the 60's. Matthew McConaughey overacted and like many of the others seemed afflicted with a case of sort of over the top white guilt, Sandra Bullock's character was completely pointless and just seemed to be forced into the movie for eye candy purposes, Samuel L Jackson was good portraying a sympathetic character....... but overall it was more everyone's response to the situation that derailed this movie and made it an overdone and overdramatized picture of race relations in 1990's America.

    It is a well made movie, and the acting is generally O.K., but in the Law I know...Samuel Jacksons character..HAD TO BE..found guilty. The McConaughey speech at the end , was very week. By that time, the Director Joel Schmacher must have thought he had his audience in the palm of his hand, so not much thought was put into the most important part of the movie. It is a movie that sets out to say a lot, yet in the end ...we know things wont change in the U. S. of A. I felt i had watched this type of manipulative film many times (and i have)...we all have. The year it is portraying really does not matter. What matters is ...does anyone believe this ? And if you do, you must ask yourself.....WHY..?? (when it is clearly a million miles away from reality).

    A Time to Kill (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Set in a racist South, a young lawyer (Matthew McConaughey) takes the case of a black man (Samuel L. Jackson) who murdered the two white men who raped his ten-year-old daughter. Soon the lawyer comes under attack from the KKK while at the same time he tries to find a way to get his client off. There are certainly flaws to be found in this film but for a mainstream courtroom drama I think it offers enough that makes it highly entertaining. We could debate the political issues in the story for years but I'll freely admit that I agree with what Jackson's character did. I think what makes this film so entertaining is that we're given some very memorable characters and the actors do a terrific job bringing them to life. McConaughey easily became a star thanks to this film and I think he showed a great talent as he really nailed this character and the various emotions that he goes through. Jackson is also very good in his part as the sympathetic father and Sandra Bullock is also terrific in her role as a woman trying to help the case. Donald Sutherland is also very memorable in his supporting role as is his son Kiefer who plays a racist. Kevin Spacey, Oliver Platt, Charles S. Dutton, Brenda Flicker Chris Cooper and Ashley Judd are also very good in their roles. The story itself is one that could cause a heated debate but I thought for the most part it was professionally told by director Joel Schumacher. With that said, I think the director creates some rather not-so-good moments including a few silly close-ups and over-dramatic moments that happen with them. Take a look at the evil juror who wants to fry the Jackson character and during one scene he says something bad and we get a cheap thunder sound effect. Another thing that keeps the film from being perfect is how evil everyone is. I mean there's an evil cop, a cheating D.A., a crooked judge and just about everyone else is guilty of something. I think the story was strong enough without having everyone being dirty of something. At a minute short of 150-minutes, the film runs on a bit too long but thankfully the performances and story are strong enough to carry most of it. A TIME TO KILL is certainly far from perfect but it's certainly entertainment at its highest level.

    I found and read some comments about this movie before watching that this movie is cheap and tasteless, after that I lost interest to watch. But I got more positive comments and finally watched it. Don't know how someone can use words 'cheap and tasteless' about this movie, but I strongly recommend that just watch before reading so many comments. This movie has a strong theme, some fine acting (specially, Matthew McConaughey) and nice screen playing. It would take almost 150 minutes of your time but I think, you should remember this movie for long time after watching.

    A Time to Kill (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Set in a racist South, a young lawyer (Matthew McConaughey) takes the case of a black man (Samuel L. Jackson) who murdered the two white men who raped his ten-year-old daughter. Soon the lawyer comes under attack from the KKK while at the same time he tries to find a way to get his client off. There are certainly flaws to be found in this film but for a mainstream courtroom drama I think it offers enough that makes it highly entertaining. We could debate the political issues in the story for years but I'll freely admit that I agree with what Jackson's character did. I think what makes this film so entertaining is that we're given some very memorable characters and the actors do a terrific job bringing them to life. McConaughey easily became a star thanks to this film and I think he showed a great talent as he really nailed this character and the various emotions that he goes through. Jackson is also very good in his part as the sympathetic father and Sandra Bullock is also terrific in her role as a woman trying to help the case. Donald Sutherland is also very memorable in his supporting role as is his son Kiefer who plays a racist. Kevin Spacey, Oliver Platt, Charles S. Dutton, Brenda Flicker Chris Cooper and Ashley Judd are also very good in their roles. The story itself is one that could cause a heated debate but I thought for the most part it was professionally told by director Joel Schumacher. With that said, I think the director creates some rather not-so-good moments including a few silly close-ups and over-dramatic moments that happen with them. Take a look at the evil juror who wants to fry the Jackson character and during one scene he says something bad and we get a cheap thunder sound effect. Another thing that keeps the film from being perfect is how evil everyone is. I mean there's an evil cop, a cheating D.A., a crooked judge and just about everyone else is guilty of something. I think the story was strong enough without having everyone being dirty of something. At a minute short of 150-minutes, the film runs on a bit too long but thankfully the performances and story are strong enough to carry most of it. A TIME TO KILL is certainly far from perfect but it's certainly entertainment at its highest level.

    I found and read some comments about this movie before watching that this movie is cheap and tasteless, after that I lost interest to watch. But I got more positive comments and finally watched it. Don't know how someone can use words 'cheap and tasteless' about this movie, but I strongly recommend that just watch before reading so many comments. This movie has a strong theme, some fine acting (specially, Matthew McConaughey) and nice screen playing. It would take almost 150 minutes of your time but I think, you should remember this movie for long time after watching.

    Sometimes on IMDb, reviewers take the movies too seriously. They analyze the plot development and plausibility and compare on-screen characters with real life examples such as their next door neighbors or as in the case of "A Time to Kill" the people of the American South. The movie was based on a John Grisham novel of the same name, and this author has become famous for writing engrossing legal thrillers with memorable characters. "A Time to Kill" was one of his more sensational novels and tugs on the heart strings more than the rest, such as "The Client" or "The Rainmaker." Joel Schumacher directed, which gives the movie a popcorn entertainment, comic-book feel. After all, this is the same guy who directed the first two "Men in Black" movies and "Batman Forever/Batman and Robin." He manages to create some stirring images, such as when Carl Lee carries his bloodied daughter Tanya out the front door of the house and toward the ambulance, with the whole neighborhood looking on. Yes, we know that such a thing would never happen in real life (paramedics would have put her on a gurney in the living room) but the anguish and rage on Carl Lee's (Samuel L. Jackson) face packs a wallop. Charles S. Dutton shows the world he can be a tough hombre in his role as Sheriff Walls, an ex NFL player for the Rams. Another powerful scene shows him invading a bar to collect the two boys who have raped and ravaged Tanya. And after Carl Lee has murdered the two boys who have damaged his daughter, Sheriff Walls wearily leads a police motorcade to Carl Lee's house, where the only dialog is "See you Gwen." This movie contains the first major role for Matthew McConnaughey and an Oscar-worthy performance from Kevin Spacey as Rufus Buckley a DA with gubernatorial aspirations. Sparks fly from the screen because of the sexual chemistry between McConnaughey and Sandra Bullock, who plays Ellen Roark, an idealistic law student who volunteers to help with the case. Other surprises include a delightful turn from Oliver Platt as a caddish southern divorce lawyer and Jake Brigance's (McConnaughey) close friend. In other directorial hands, the movie could have been a simple courtroom drama, but Joel Schumacher emphasizes the subplot of the rise of the "new" Ku Klux Klan as a response to the murder of the two boys by a black man. The Klan violently clashes with the townsfolk, a whole National Guard battalion gets called in and "A Time to Kill" ends up filled with the most action ever for a John Grisham adaptation. Of course, the ending satisfies, too. This is the kind of movie that can be watched over and over again the way an intricate painting can be enjoyed over and over again.

    A Time to Kill (1996) What a powerful movie. Yes, it's built on movie-making clich&eacute;s, it manipulates the viewer, and there are excesses and improbabilities. And yes, in fact, it is on some level kind of trashy. But it's extremely well made trash in the hands of director Joel Schumacher. And when you deal with contemporary race relations in Mississippi through a capital murder trial you end up at the extremes of society. All of what happens here makes sense and reveals some remaining strains of bigotry, violence, and personal blindness in society. I don't like the underlying moral logic much, but if you can appreciate American vigilante revenge (I can't, even though it happens in a lot of convincing movies), you'll click with the message here, too. It might slightly help to remember this made a little more sense in 1996. Or maybe 1986, which is when the book was being written. Oddly, and wonderfully, the movie feels like something that wouldn't happen in 2013, when I saw it. Maybe in some ways all of this could still take similar vague form, and I have not doubt about racism being alive in kicking in many places around the country, but what happens here is meant to be the vestiges from 20 years ago of what was once commonplace in the south. Hopefully last vestiges. A cinematic strength here beyond the story of a black man in an essentially white justice system is the rich cast. There are something like seven major stars in various roles, from Matthew McConaughey as the leading defense lawyer who does a good job to Ashley Judd as his wife who isn't given much to do or say and who is surprisingly canned. There is Donald Sutherland as the wise renegade (and disbarred) old lawyer who helps from the background (rather like Preminger's 1959 "Anatomy of Murder") and his son Kiefer as a crazed neo-KKK bigot with a quick tendency to cruelty. Somewhere between is the perp and eventual hero to some played with decent intensity by Samuel L. Jackson, and the bright smart-alecky law clerk in the form of Sandra Bullock. Throw in Kevin Spacey as the haughty D.A and Patrick McGoohan of all people (he's the lead in the great 1960s t.v. series, "The Prisoner") as the judge. Both are terrific. Expect lots of interwoven plots, lots of violence against lots of innocent people, and some speechmaking about how to achieve justice and find the best in people. The movie is designed to make you approve of the revenge killings near the start of the movie, revenge by a father after the brutal rape and torture of his 10 year old daughter. The key defense hinges on the idea that any father would have done the same. It's "justifiable homicide." But to appreciate this is to turn a blind eye to the fact that there might never be such a thing as justifiable homicide. I mean, that's what lynching is based on--and so what one person calls justified is what another calls senseless vendetta-based murderous sin. And the underlying message is that if someone commits a bad enough crime they deserve to die. Without a trial. This is what drives the movie and makes you take sides. It's almost impossible to side with the prosecutor, who makes the simple case that you don't kill people in cold blood in our society. But the common folk of the jury are all twelve swayed in the final four minutes by a heartwrenching and unlikely speech by our young lawyer hero. The KKK finds its comeuppance. The new South is apparently just starting to see the problem with its centuries of racism. The more I write the more I realize the movie is almost shameful. But a well-acted, well directed bit of movie-making shame. Yes it's worth seeing, no matter which side of the morality you are on. It is, to be sure, by the same director who gave us "Falling Down," if you remember that other justification of revenge violence. It is also, luckily, a condemnation of racism in many forms. See it, but give it some thought.

    Although I enjoyed it, I did find this film way too long. It gets lost in too much detail part way through and there is an awful lot of stuff in there that has very little baring on the case in hand. I did also find it a little predictable in places, but then I have seen a few Grisham adaptations and they do tend to follow a similar pattern. As a revenge thriller, it's not all that good, but as a courtroom drama, I found it quite riveting. It's still quite an enjoyable watch, films about justice generally are (I find) and so I can just about deem it RECOMMENDED (even if it's a tad long). My score: 6.5/10 IMDb Score: 7.1/10 (based on 51,195 votes at the time of going to press). MetaScore: 54/100: (Based on 21 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 67/100 (based on 51 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 59/100 'Want to See' (based on 88,981 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

    On what planet does this movie take place? Because it certainly isn't earth. Apparently on this planet, all Southerners are sadistic, racist pigs who delight in hurting other people. Also in this universe, it's OK for a black man to kill two white men if he believes they might get off for the crime they committed, and that everyone who tries to get him off is a hero. Anyone who wants him in jail is racist. Typical extremist liberal schlock with no connection to reality. People who like this movie are the same type of people who think a cop killer like Mumia Abu Jamal should go free, simply because he's black. Don't watch this movie.

    John Grisham novels always have been handled with great respect by Hollywood, and TIME is no exception. An all-star cast and a top-flight director tell the story of a young southern lawyer who defends a black man accused of killing two white men who raped his 10-year-old daughter. Tempers flare, the KKK is reborn and people start getting hurt and dying. Expert witnesses turn out not to be so expert and the young lawyer's house is burned to the ground. The suspense is in high gear throughout, and the script is powerfully written. Matthew M., Sam Jackson, Keifer and Donald Sutherland and Sandra Bullock pull out all the stops. You'll feel like you're right there with them. While the discerning viewer may not buy the saccharine ending -- I sure as hell did not -- the movie nevertheless will sweep you up in its intensity.

    I read the book before I watched the movie. I was disappointed how the movie left out so much detail from the book, or they changed how things happened. Changing these details affected the movie. I know you can't get all of the detail from the book into the movie, especially if you want it a reasonable length, but I feel they focused on unimportant parts, and left out important ones. I feel that I would have appreciated the movie more if I watched it before reading the book. I found myself constantly thinking about how they changed things or completely left them out, instead of being able to fully enjoy the movie.

    First of all I want to say I've seen a number of good films which are great illustrations of racial injustice, and that I was moved by. It is without a doubt a stain on the history of our nation. However, this wasn't one of them. I think its entirely over the top for the times that it was set in. To me it promotes racial division rather than harmony, as well as vigilante justice. I can't envision any prosecutor in the 1990's seeking the gas chamber and first degree murder charges against Carl Lee, nor the reprehensible acts of the two lowlifes who raped his daughter to spark the rebirth of a KKK to defend them or want to avenge their deaths. Yes there will always be idiot racists and lunatic fringe groups, but the fabric of society in this movie would have been a lot more believable had it been set in the 60's. Matthew McConaughey overacted and like many of the others seemed afflicted with a case of sort of over the top white guilt, Sandra Bullock's character was completely pointless and just seemed to be forced into the movie for eye candy purposes, Samuel L Jackson was good portraying a sympathetic character....... but overall it was more everyone's response to the situation that derailed this movie and made it an overdone and overdramatized picture of race relations in 1990's America.

    It is a well made movie, and the acting is generally O.K., but in the Law I know...Samuel Jacksons character..HAD TO BE..found guilty. The McConaughey speech at the end , was very week. By that time, the Director Joel Schmacher must have thought he had his audience in the palm of his hand, so not much thought was put into the most important part of the movie. It is a movie that sets out to say a lot, yet in the end ...we know things wont change in the U. S. of A. I felt i had watched this type of manipulative film many times (and i have)...we all have. The year it is portraying really does not matter. What matters is ...does anyone believe this ? And if you do, you must ask yourself.....WHY..?? (when it is clearly a million miles away from reality).

You'll feel like you're right there with them. While the discerning viewer may not buy the saccharine ending -- I sure as hell did not -- the movie nevertheless will sweep you up in its intensity.

    I read the book before I watched the movie. I was disappointed how the movie left out so much detail from the book, or they changed how things happened. Changing these details affected the movie. I know you can't get all of the detail from the book into the movie, especially if you want it a reasonable length, but I feel they focused on unimportant parts, and left out important ones. I feel that I would have appreciated the movie more if I watched it before reading the book. I found myself constantly thinking about how they changed things or completely left them out, instead of being able to fully enjoy the movie.

    First of all I want to say I've seen a number of good films which are great illustrations of racial injustice, and that I was moved by. It is without a doubt a stain on the history of our nation. However, this wasn't one of them. I think its entirely over the top for the times that it was set in. To me it promotes racial division rather than harmony, as well as vigilante justice. I can't envision any prosecutor in the 1990's seeking the gas chamber and first degree murder charges against Carl Lee, nor the reprehensible acts of the two lowlifes who raped his daughter to spark the rebirth of a KKK to defend them or want to avenge their deaths. Yes there will always be idiot racists and lunatic fringe groups, but the fabric of society in this movie would have been a lot more believable had it been set in the 60's. Matthew McConaughey overacted and like many of the others seemed afflicted with a case of sort of over the top white guilt, Sandra Bullock's character was completely pointless and just seemed to be forced into the movie for eye candy purposes, Samuel L Jackson was good portraying a sympathetic character....... but overall it was more everyone's response to the situation that derailed this movie and made it an overdone and overdramatized picture of race relations in 1990's America.

    It is a well made movie, and the acting is generally O.K., but in the Law I know...Samuel Jacksons character..HAD TO BE..found guilty. The McConaughey speech at the end , was very week. By that time, the Director Joel Schmacher must have thought he had his audience in the palm of his hand, so not much thought was put into the most important part of the movie. It is a movie that sets out to say a lot, yet in the end ...we know things wont change in the U. S. of A. I felt i had watched this type of manipulative film many times (and i have)...we all have. The year it is portraying really does not matter. What matters is ...does anyone believe this ? And if you do, you must ask yourself.....WHY..?? (when it is clearly a million miles away from reality).

    A Time to Kill (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Set in a racist South, a young lawyer (Matthew McConaughey) takes the case of a black man (Samuel L. Jackson) who murdered the two white men who raped his ten-year-old daughter. Soon the lawyer comes under attack from the KKK while at the same time he tries to find a way to get his client off. There are certainly flaws to be found in this film but for a mainstream courtroom drama I think it offers enough that makes it highly entertaining. We could debate the political issues in the story for years but I'll freely admit that I agree with what Jackson's character did. I think what makes this film so entertaining is that we're given some very memorable characters and the actors do a terrific job bringing them to life. McConaughey easily became a star thanks to this film and I think he showed a great talent as he really nailed this character and the various emotions that he goes through. Jackson is also very good in his part as the sympathetic father and Sandra Bullock is also terrific in her role as a woman trying to help the case. Donald Sutherland is also very memorable in his supporting role as is his son Kiefer who plays a racist. Kevin Spacey, Oliver Platt, Charles S. Dutton, Brenda Flicker Chris Cooper and Ashley Judd are also very good in their roles. The story itself is one that could cause a heated debate but I thought for the most part it was professionally told by director Joel Schumacher. With that said, I think the director creates some rather not-so-good moments including a few silly close-ups and over-dramatic moments that happen with them. Take a look at the evil juror who wants to fry the Jackson character and during one scene he says something bad and we get a cheap thunder sound effect. Another thing that keeps the film from being perfect is how evil everyone is. I mean there's an evil cop, a cheating D.A., a crooked judge and just about everyone else is guilty of something. I think the story was strong enough without having everyone being dirty of something. At a minute short of 150-minutes, the film runs on a bit too long but thankfully the performances and story are strong enough to carry most of it. A TIME TO KILL is certainly far from perfect but it's certainly entertainment at its highest level.

    I found and read some comments about this movie before watching that this movie is cheap and tasteless, after that I lost interest to watch. But I got more positive comments and finally watched it. Don't know how someone can use words 'cheap and tasteless' about this movie, but I strongly recommend that just watch before reading so many comments. This movie has a strong theme, some fine acting (specially, Matthew McConaughey) and nice screen playing. It would take almost 150 minutes of your time but I think, you should remember this movie for long time after watching.

    Sometimes on IMDb, reviewers take the movies too seriously. They analyze the plot development and plausibility and compare on-screen characters with real life examples such as their next door neighbors or as in the case of "A Time to Kill" the people of the American South. The movie was based on a John Grisham novel of the same name, and this author has become famous for writing engrossing legal thrillers with memorable characters. "A Time to Kill" was one of his more sensational novels and tugs on the heart strings more than the rest, such as "The Client" or "The Rainmaker." Joel Schumacher directed, which gives the movie a popcorn entertainment, comic-book feel. After all, this is the same guy who directed the first two "Men in Black" movies and "Batman Forever/Batman and Robin." He manages to create some stirring images, such as when Carl Lee carries his bloodied daughter Tanya out the front door of the house and toward the ambulance, with the whole neighborhood looking on. Yes, we know that such a thing would never happen in real life (paramedics would have put her on a gurney in the living room) but the anguish and rage on Carl Lee's (Samuel L. Jackson) face packs a wallop. Charles S. Dutton shows the world he can be a tough hombre in his role as Sheriff Walls, an ex NFL player for the Rams. Another powerful scene shows him invading a bar to collect the two boys who have raped and ravaged Tanya. And after Carl Lee has murdered the two boys who have damaged his daughter, Sheriff Walls wearily leads a police motorcade to Carl Lee's house, where the only dialog is "See you Gwen." This movie contains the first major role for Matthew McConnaughey and an Oscar-worthy performance from Kevin Spacey as Rufus Buckley a DA with gubernatorial aspirations. Sparks fly from the screen because of the sexual chemistry between McConnaughey and Sandra Bullock, who plays Ellen Roark, an idealistic law student who volunteers to help with the case. Other surprises include a delightful turn from Oliver Platt as a caddish southern divorce lawyer and Jake Brigance's (McConnaughey) close friend. In other directorial hands, the movie could have been a simple courtroom drama, but Joel Schumacher emphasizes the subplot of the rise of the "new" Ku Klux Klan as a response to the murder of the two boys by a black man. The Klan violently clashes with the townsfolk, a whole National Guard battalion gets called in and "A Time to Kill" ends up filled with the most action ever for a John Grisham adaptation. Of course, the ending satisfies, too. This is the kind of movie that can be watched over and over again the way an intricate painting can be enjoyed over and over again.

    A Time to Kill (1996) What a powerful movie. Yes, it's built on movie-making clich&eacute;s, it manipulates the viewer, and there are excesses and improbabilities. And yes, in fact, it is on some level kind of trashy. But it's extremely well made trash in the hands of director Joel Schumacher. And when you deal with contemporary race relations in Mississippi through a capital murder trial you end up at the extremes of society. All of what happens here makes sense and reveals some remaining strains of bigotry, violence, and personal blindness in society. I don't like the underlying moral logic much, but if you can appreciate American vigilante revenge (I can't, even though it happens in a lot of convincing movies), you'll click with the message here, too. It might slightly help to remember this made a little more sense in 1996. Or maybe 1986, which is when the book was being written. Oddly, and wonderfully, the movie feels like something that wouldn't happen in 2013, when I saw it. Maybe in some ways all of this could still take similar vague form, and I have not doubt about racism being alive in kicking in many places around the country, but what happens here is meant to be the vestiges from 20 years ago of what was once commonplace in the south. Hopefully last vestiges. A cinematic strength here beyond the story of a black man in an essentially white justice system is the rich cast. There are something like seven major stars in various roles, from Matthew McConaughey as the leading defense lawyer who does a good job to Ashley Judd as his wife who isn't given much to do or say and who is surprisingly canned. There is Donald Sutherland as the wise renegade (and disbarred) old lawyer who helps from the background (rather like Preminger's 1959 "Anatomy of Murder") and his son Kiefer as a crazed neo-KKK bigot with a quick tendency to cruelty. Somewhere between is the perp and eventual hero to some played with decent intensity by Samuel L. Jackson, and the bright smart-alecky law clerk in the form of Sandra Bullock. Throw in Kevin Spacey as the haughty D.A and Patrick McGoohan of all people (he's the lead in the great 1960s t.v. series, "The Prisoner") as the judge. Both are terrific. Expect lots of interwoven plots, lots of violence against lots of innocent people, and some speechmaking about how to achieve justice and find the best in people. The movie is designed to make you approve of the revenge killings near the start of the movie, revenge by a father after the brutal rape and torture of his 10 year old daughter. The key defense hinges on the idea that any father would have done the same. It's "justifiable homicide." But to appreciate this is to turn a blind eye to the fact that there might never be such a thing as justifiable homicide. I mean, that's what lynching is based on--and so what one person calls justified is what another calls senseless vendetta-based murderous sin. And the underlying message is that if someone commits a bad enough crime they deserve to die. Without a trial. This is what drives the movie and makes you take sides. It's almost impossible to side with the prosecutor, who makes the simple case that you don't kill people in cold blood in our society. But the common folk of the jury are all twelve swayed in the final four minutes by a heartwrenching and unlikely speech by our young lawyer hero. The KKK finds its comeuppance. The new South is apparently just starting to see the problem with its centuries of racism. The more I write the more I realize the movie is almost shameful. But a well-acted, well directed bit of movie-making shame. Yes it's worth seeing, no matter which side of the morality you are on. It is, to be sure, by the same director who gave us "Falling Down," if you remember that other justification of revenge violence. It is also, luckily, a condemnation of racism in many forms. See it, but give it some thought.

    Although I enjoyed it, I did find this film way too long. It gets lost in too much detail part way through and there is an awful lot of stuff in there that has very little baring on the case in hand. I did also find it a little predictable in places, but then I have seen a few Grisham adaptations and they do tend to follow a similar pattern. As a revenge thriller, it's not all that good, but as a courtroom drama, I found it quite riveting. It's still quite an enjoyable watch, films about justice generally are (I find) and so I can just about deem it RECOMMENDED (even if it's a tad long). My score: 6.5/10 IMDb Score: 7.1/10 (based on 51,195 votes at the time of going to press). MetaScore: 54/100: (Based on 21 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 67/100 (based on 51 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 59/100 'Want to See' (based on 88,981 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

    On what planet does this movie take place? Because it certainly isn't earth. Apparently on this planet, all Southerners are sadistic, racist pigs who delight in hurting other people. Also in this universe, it's OK for a black man to kill two white men if he believes they might get off for the crime they committed, and that everyone who tries to get him off is a hero. Anyone who wants him in jail is racist. Typical extremist liberal schlock with no connection to reality. People who like this movie are the same type of people who think a cop killer like Mumia Abu Jamal should go free, simply because he's black. Don't watch this movie.

    John Grisham novels always have been handled with great respect by Hollywood, and TIME is no exception. An all-star cast and a top-flight director tell the story of a young southern lawyer who defends a black man accused of killing two white men who raped his 10-year-old daughter. Tempers flare, the KKK is reborn and people start getting hurt and dying. Expert witnesses turn out not to be so expert and the young lawyer's house is burned to the ground. The suspense is in high gear throughout, and the script is powerfully written. Matthew M., Sam Jackson, Keifer and Donald Sutherland and Sandra Bullock pull out all the stops. You'll feel like you're right there with them. While the discerning viewer may not buy the saccharine ending -- I sure as hell did not -- the movie nevertheless will sweep you up in its intensity.

But a well-acted, well directed bit of movie-making shame. Yes it's worth seeing, no matter which side of the morality you are on. It is, to be sure, by the same director who gave us "Falling Down," if you remember that other justification of revenge violence. It is also, luckily, a condemnation of racism in many forms. See it, but give it some thought.

    Although I enjoyed it, I did find this film way too long. It gets lost in too much detail part way through and there is an awful lot of stuff in there that has very little baring on the case in hand. I did also find it a little predictable in places, but then I have seen a few Grisham adaptations and they do tend to follow a similar pattern. As a revenge thriller, it's not all that good, but as a courtroom drama, I found it quite riveting. It's still quite an enjoyable watch, films about justice generally are (I find) and so I can just about deem it RECOMMENDED (even if it's a tad long). My score: 6.5/10 IMDb Score: 7.1/10 (based on 51,195 votes at the time of going to press). MetaScore: 54/100: (Based on 21 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 67/100 (based on 51 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 59/100 'Want to See' (based on 88,981 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).

    On what planet does this movie take place? Because it certainly isn't earth. Apparently on this planet, all Southerners are sadistic, racist pigs who delight in hurting other people. Also in this universe, it's OK for a black man to kill two white men if he believes they might get off for the crime they committed, and that everyone who tries to get him off is a hero. Anyone who wants him in jail is racist. Typical extremist liberal schlock with no connection to reality. People who like this movie are the same type of people who think a cop killer like Mumia Abu Jamal should go free, simply because he's black. Don't watch this movie.

    John Grisham novels always have been handled with great respect by Hollywood, and TIME is no exception. An all-star cast and a top-flight director tell the story of a young southern lawyer who defends a black man accused of killing two white men who raped his 10-year-old daughter. Tempers flare, the KKK is reborn and people start getting hurt and dying. Expert witnesses turn out not to be so expert and the young lawyer's house is burned to the ground. The suspense is in high gear throughout, and the script is powerfully written. Matthew M., Sam Jackson, Keifer and Donald Sutherland and Sandra Bullock pull out all the stops. You'll feel like you're right there with them. While the discerning viewer may not buy the saccharine ending -- I sure as hell did not -- the movie nevertheless will sweep you up in its intensity.

    I read the book before I watched the movie. I was disappointed how the movie left out so much detail from the book, or they changed how things happened. Changing these details affected the movie. I know you can't get all of the detail from the book into the movie, especially if you want it a reasonable length, but I feel they focused on unimportant parts, and left out important ones. I feel that I would have appreciated the movie more if I watched it before reading the book. I found myself constantly thinking about how they changed things or completely left them out, instead of being able to fully enjoy the movie.

    First of all I want to say I've seen a number of good films which are great illustrations of racial injustice, and that I was moved by. It is without a doubt a stain on the history of our nation. However, this wasn't one of them. I think its entirely over the top for the times that it was set in. To me it promotes racial division rather than harmony, as well as vigilante justice. I can't envision any prosecutor in the 1990's seeking the gas chamber and first degree murder charges against Carl Lee, nor the reprehensible acts of the two lowlifes who raped his daughter to spark the rebirth of a KKK to defend them or want to avenge their deaths. Yes there will always be idiot racists and lunatic fringe groups, but the fabric of society in this movie would have been a lot more believable had it been set in the 60's. Matthew McConaughey overacted and like many of the others seemed afflicted with a case of sort of over the top white guilt, Sandra Bullock's character was completely pointless and just seemed to be forced into the movie for eye candy purposes, Samuel L Jackson was good portraying a sympathetic character....... but overall it was more everyone's response to the situation that derailed this movie and made it an overdone and overdramatized picture of race relations in 1990's America.

    It is a well made movie, and the acting is generally O.K., but in the Law I know...Samuel Jacksons character..HAD TO BE..found guilty. The McConaughey speech at the end , was very week. By that time, the Director Joel Schmacher must have thought he had his audience in the palm of his hand, so not much thought was put into the most important part of the movie. It is a movie that sets out to say a lot, yet in the end ...we know things wont change in the U. S. of A. I felt i had watched this type of manipulative film many times (and i have)...we all have. The year it is portraying really does not matter. What matters is ...does anyone believe this ? And if you do, you must ask yourself.....WHY..?? (when it is clearly a million miles away from reality).

    A Time to Kill (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Set in a racist South, a young lawyer (Matthew McConaughey) takes the case of a black man (Samuel L. Jackson) who murdered the two white men who raped his ten-year-old daughter. Soon the lawyer comes under attack from the KKK while at the same time he tries to find a way to get his client off. There are certainly flaws to be found in this film but for a mainstream courtroom drama I think it offers enough that makes it highly entertaining. We could debate the political issues in the story for years but I'll freely admit that I agree with what Jackson's character did. I think what makes this film so entertaining is that we're given some very memorable characters and the actors do a terrific job bringing them to life. McConaughey easily became a star thanks to this film and I think he showed a great talent as he really nailed this character and the various emotions that he goes through. Jackson is also very good in his part as the sympathetic father and Sandra Bullock is also terrific in her role as a woman trying to help the case. Donald Sutherland is also very memorable in his supporting role as is his son Kiefer who plays a racist. Kevin Spacey, Oliver Platt, Charles S. Dutton, Brenda Flicker Chris Cooper and Ashley Judd are also very good in their roles. The story itself is one that could cause a heated debate but I thought for the most part it was professionally told by director Joel Schumacher. With that said, I think the director creates some rather not-so-good moments including a few silly close-ups and over-dramatic moments that happen with them. Take a look at the evil juror who wants to fry the Jackson character and during one scene he says something bad and we get a cheap thunder sound effect. Another thing that keeps the film from being perfect is how evil everyone is. I mean there's an evil cop, a cheating D.A., a crooked judge and just about everyone else is guilty of something. I think the story was strong enough without having everyone being dirty of something. At a minute short of 150-minutes, the film runs on a bit too long but thankfully the performances and story are strong enough to carry most of it. A TIME TO KILL is certainly far from perfect but it's certainly entertainment at its highest level.

    I found and read some comments about this movie before watching that this movie is cheap and tasteless, after that I lost interest to watch. But I got more positive comments and finally watched it. Don't know how someone can use words 'cheap and tasteless' about this movie, but I strongly recommend that just watch before reading so many comments. This movie has a strong theme, some fine acting (specially, Matthew McConaughey) and nice screen playing. It would take almost 150 minutes of your time but I think, you should remember this movie for long time after watching.

    Sometimes on IMDb, reviewers take the movies too seriously. They analyze the plot development and plausibility and compare on-screen characters with real life examples such as their next door neighbors or as in the case of "A Time to Kill" the people of the American South. The movie was based on a John Grisham novel of the same name, and this author has become famous for writing engrossing legal thrillers with memorable characters. "A Time to Kill" was one of his more sensational novels and tugs on the heart strings more than the rest, such as "The Client" or "The Rainmaker." Joel Schumacher directed, which gives the movie a popcorn entertainment, comic-book feel. After all, this is the same guy who directed the first two "Men in Black" movies and "Batman Forever/Batman and Robin." He manages to create some stirring images, such as when Carl Lee carries his bloodied daughter Tanya out the front door of the house and toward the ambulance, with the whole neighborhood looking on. Yes, we know that such a thing would never happen in real life (paramedics would have put her on a gurney in the living room) but the anguish and rage on Carl Lee's (Samuel L. Jackson) face packs a wallop. Charles S. Dutton shows the world he can be a tough hombre in his role as Sheriff Walls, an ex NFL player for the Rams. Another powerful scene shows him invading a bar to collect the two boys who have raped and ravaged Tanya. And after Carl Lee has murdered the two boys who have damaged his daughter, Sheriff Walls wearily leads a police motorcade to Carl Lee's house, where the only dialog is "See you Gwen." This movie contains the first major role for Matthew McConnaughey and an Oscar-worthy performance from Kevin Spacey as Rufus Buckley a DA with gubernatorial aspirations. Sparks fly from the screen because of the sexual chemistry between McConnaughey and Sandra Bullock, who plays Ellen Roark, an idealistic law student who volunteers to help with the case. Other surprises include a delightful turn from Oliver Platt as a caddish southern divorce lawyer and Jake Brigance's (McConnaughey) close friend. In other directorial hands, the movie could have been a simple courtroom drama, but Joel Schumacher emphasizes the subplot of the rise of the "new" Ku Klux Klan as a response to the murder of the two boys by a black man. The Klan violently clashes with the townsfolk, a whole National Guard battalion gets called in and "A Time to Kill" ends up filled with the most action ever for a John Grisham adaptation. Of course, the ending satisfies, too. This is the kind of movie that can be watched over and over again the way an intricate painting can be enjoyed over and over again.

    A Time to Kill (1996) What a powerful movie. Yes, it's built on movie-making clich&eacute;s, it manipulates the viewer, and there are excesses and improbabilities. And yes, in fact, it is on some level kind of trashy. But it's extremely well made trash in the hands of director Joel Schumacher. And when you deal with contemporary race relations in Mississippi through a capital murder trial you end up at the extremes of society. All of what happens here makes sense and reveals some remaining strains of bigotry, violence, and personal blindness in society. I don't like the underlying moral logic much, but if you can appreciate American vigilante revenge (I can't, even though it happens in a lot of convincing movies), you'll click with the message here, too. It might slightly help to remember this made a little more sense in 1996. Or maybe 1986, which is when the book was being written. Oddly, and wonderfully, the movie feels like something that wouldn't happen in 2013, when I saw it. Maybe in some ways all of this could still take similar vague form, and I have not doubt about racism being alive in kicking in many places around the country, but what happens here is meant to be the vestiges from 20 years ago of what was once commonplace in the south. Hopefully last vestiges. A cinematic strength here beyond the story of a black man in an essentially white justice system is the rich cast. There are something like seven major stars in various roles, from Matthew McConaughey as the leading defense lawyer who does a good job to Ashley Judd as his wife who isn't given much to do or say and who is surprisingly canned. There is Donald Sutherland as the wise renegade (and disbarred) old lawyer who helps from the background (rather like Preminger's 1959 "Anatomy of Murder") and his son Kiefer as a crazed neo-KKK bigot with a quick tendency to cruelty. Somewhere between is the perp and eventual hero to some played with decent intensity by Samuel L. Jackson, and the bright smart-alecky law clerk in the form of Sandra Bullock. Throw in Kevin Spacey as the haughty D.A and Patrick McGoohan of all people (he's the lead in the great 1960s t.v. series, "The Prisoner") as the judge. Both are terrific. Expect lots of interwoven plots, lots of violence against lots of innocent people, and some speechmaking about how to achieve justice and find the best in people. The movie is designed to make you approve of the revenge killings near the start of the movie, revenge by a father after the brutal rape and torture of his 10 year old daughter. The key defense hinges on the idea that any father would have done the same. It's "justifiable homicide." But to appreciate this is to turn a blind eye to the fact that there might never be such a thing as justifiable homicide. I mean, that's what lynching is based on--and so what one person calls justified is what another calls senseless vendetta-based murderous sin. And the underlying message is that if someone commits a bad enough crime they deserve to die. Without a trial. This is what drives the movie and makes you take sides. It's almost impossible to side with the prosecutor, who makes the simple case that you don't kill people in cold blood in our society. But the common folk of the jury are all twelve swayed in the final four minutes by a heartwrenching and unlikely speech by our young lawyer hero. The KKK finds its comeuppance. The new South is apparently just starting to see the problem with its centuries of racism. The more I write the more I realize the movie is almost shameful. But a well-acted, well directed bit of movie-making shame. Yes it's worth seeing, no matter which side of the morality you are on. It is, to be sure, by the same director who gave us "Falling Down," if you remember that other justification of revenge violence. It is also, luckily, a condemnation of racism in many forms. See it, but give it some thought.
