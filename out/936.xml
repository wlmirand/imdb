 <sinopse>
  The coal mine in a northern English village may be closing, which would also mean the end of the miners' brass band.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In existence for a hundred years, Grimley Colliery Brass band is as old as the mine. But the miners are now deciding whether to fight to keep the pit open, and the future for town and band looks bleak. Although the arrival of flugelhorn player Gloria injects some life into the players, and bandleader Danny continues to exhort them to continue in the national competition, frictions and pressures are all too evident. And who's side is Gloria actually on?

    I have been watching Waking the Dead, and thought I would explore other works done by it's stars. I'm starting with Eve (Tara Fitzgerald). The star of this film is not Fitzgerald, but Pete Postlethwaite, who was nominated for an Oscar for In the Name of the Father, and also starred in Inception and The Lost World: Jurassic Park, among others. Postlethwaite is trying to keep a brass band together in the face of coal mines being shut down, which will result in the eventual demise of his town. It is a lighthearted, sometimes depressing film which features a love story between young people (Fitzgerald and Ewan McGregor), a crisis involving a married couple (Stephen Tompkinson and Melanie Hill), and a health crisis involving Danny (Postlethwaite). Of course, there is also a national band contest at the Royal Albert Hall. There is also a bit of politics in the film with a couple of rants against Maggie Thatcher. They even managed to work Danny Boy in the film. Great! I am glad that Fitzgerald brought me here, as it was an enjoyable experience.

    *Spoiler/plot- Brassed Off, 1996. A 100 years old coal miners brass band members hit economic and social troubles when their coal mine's labor problems threaten to shut the mine down along with the band organization. *Special Stars- Pete Postlewaite, Ewan McGregor, Jim Carter. *Theme- Taking a social stand and speaking out is as important as making band music. *Trivia/location/goofs- UK, Yorshire. This film's band music caused a resurgence of interest in band music. Wtach this film for first-time on camera performances for many British and Scotish leading character actors. *Emotion- A thoroughly enjoyable character driven film plot about regular people's struggles with work, family and goals. It's a memorable film for it's themes, good casting, writing, and production.

    This is British Cinema at its very best and has been my favourite film of all time since I first saw it on the big screen. I cannot think of two more powerful performances committed to celluloid than those of Peter Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson. There is so much emotion in "Brassed Off" that anyone who fails to be moved must have a heart of stone...if indeed they have a heart at all. People I know (or reviews I have read) that didn't like the film have criticised the intense political messages within it, but in my opinion these folk are missing the point entirely. It's true that there is a fierce undercurrent of anti right wing leaning running through the movie, but to portray the characters any other way would be factually inaccurate. Some may view Thatcher as a Saint, but characters like those in Brassed Off can only ever view her as an evil tyrant. Anyway I'm going off on a tangent now. My point is this: Brassed Off is a very humane picture that paints a picture of early eighties folk who have been robbed of their livelihood, yet still manages to be funny, charming, heartwarming, heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. A truly wonderful film.

    The music was absolutely exquisite and the acting excellent. Felt that some elements could have been left out e.g. God-bashing moments, blasphemy which I thought were totally unnecessary and offensive. Does the director/writer/producer have something against the Catholic Church in particular? The speech at the end was quite disappointing for someone with one foot on the grave and it was lacking some type of closure. Yes, I can imagine the frustration of these coal-mine workers as obviously these things have been happening and are still happening all around the world including Australia in the different industries. I have always loved watching English comedy/drama but, this one put me off somewhat and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone quite honestly. Rather buy a CD with similar music and avoid all the non-sensical things by watching movies such as this one.

    For any American worker who may be feeling a bit under-appreciated  relax! No one does working-class anger and analysis like our British cousins from across the sea. Brassed Off takes place in Grimley, a small mining village in Worchestershire, England, threatened by the possibility of their mine closing. Tara Fitzgerald plays Gloria Mullen, a surveyor for the Grimley Mining Company, whose job is to create a study that she thinks will keep Grimley open and save jobs. "My figures show Grimley has a future. It's a profitable pit," she tells Andy, her friend, fellow band member, and old flame. Ewan MacGregor, as Andy Barrow, is one hard realist who schools her in the ways of management's shady plans over coffee one night. "You're report means as much to them as we do. . . bugger all. . . And those good eggs at the head office think they've done all they can. Oh dear. . . they've been very fair, very reasonable. Done their best, done their sums and - oh dear - they just don't add up! They'll have to close another pit  a shame  and they probably made their decision why you were still in college." Gloria can't understand why Andy will vote to keep the mine open then, if the majority of miners will be voting for "redundancy" - to close the mine and take a buy-out. "No hope  just principles", he replies. Amid the backdrop of this drama, Gloria and Andy's budding relationship suffers a few bumps and bruises along the way. A few of the more vocal Grimley Colliery Brass Band members accuse Andy of being a scab and Gloria a management sellout until almost the bitter end. The film intersperses strike scenes and family crisis's with rousing band numbers, as they practice for a musical competition. The late  and great  Peter Postlethwaite, portrays Danny, the orchestra's leader  in good times and bad. The musical numbers represent the spirit of the town as the villagers grapple with their pressure and problems. He encourages the band members to keep going, no matter what, even if it means the further deterioration of his own poor health. Danny believes that the band can win fist prize, which symbolizes their collective spirit - undaunted and unbowed. During her viability study report to management, Gloria discovers that Andy's predictions are all-too accurate, right down to the timing of their decision to close Grimley. Gloria discovers that she too has principles and resigns her cushy position, which ultimately enables the band to travel to the band finals at Albert Hall. The band plays on, all the way to Albert Hall, even though many of the members are cynical and demoralized, knowing that their lives will be forever changed as a result of management's callous actions. And although Grimley closes, Danny and Gloria are able to rally the Grimley Brass Banders to play their hearts out in London at the National Band Competition, winning first place. Danny: ". . .over the last ten years, this bloody government has systematically destroyed an entire industry. OUR industry. And not just our industry - our communities, our homes, our lives. All in the name of "progress". And for a few lousy bob. I'll tell you something else you might not know, as well. A fortnight ago, this band's pit were closed - another thousand men lost their jobs. And that's not all they lost. Most of them lost the will to win a while ago. A few of them even lost the will to fight. But when it comes to losing the will to live, to breathe, the point is - if this lot were seals or whales, you'd all be up in bloody arms. But their not, are they, no, no they're not. They're just ordinary common-or-garden honest, decent human beings. And not one of them with an ounce of bloody hope left. Oh aye, they can knock out a bloody good tune. But what the f*#k does that matter? And now I'm going to take my boys out onto the town. Thank you." See what I mean?

    BRASSED OFF is a 1996 movie from England - written and directed by Mark Herman - in that tradition of those movies about the working classes attempting to better themselves: THE FULLY MONTY, BILLY ELLIOT and MADE IN DAGENHAM being other prominent examples. At the time it seemed like one of the last nails in the coffin of the outgoing Tory government. It's set in a real-looking Yorkshire mining town a few years after the 1984/85 miners strike, where the local coal mine is about to be closed. The miners (Ewan McGregor, Jim Carter, Stephen Tompkinson and others) find solidarity in their brass band under their conductor - retired miner Danny (the late Pete Postlewaite in his finest screen role), a man for whom music matters above all else. The pit closes, but the band makes it to the national brass band competition final at the Albert Hall. On winning, you expect Danny to make some sentimental speech about how - in spite of everything - music holds the band together. Instead, he delivers probably the explicit political diatribe against the then Conservative government and the devastation unemployment inflicts on people. It's a superb moment in a film with its heart and soul in the dying working class communities of Yorkshire. This isn't a piece of Ken Loach-like realism - it's prettified and sentimentalised for a mainstream audience, yet the movie looses nothing for it. At the close, the brass band play Elgar's Pomp and Circumstace March Number 1 as they pass the Houses of Parliament. It's meant to be ironic but it's also very touching.

    Minor spoilers ahoy... Yes I realise this is more a tribute to the man than the film, but frankly I don't care. Steven Spielberg worked with Pete Postlethwaite on Jurassic Park and is quoted as saying Pete was "probably the best actor in the world" and who can disagree? Brassed Off is on TV right now as I type this, being shown in tribute to Pete and in it I believe he reached the pinnacle of his career. I lived through the Thatcher years with miners strikes and the subsequent closer of the pits and heavy industry putting millions on the dole. I was there at a strike meeting held outside a local heavy industry site where thousands were later thrown on the scrap heap. The speech given by Pete at the end of the film sums it up exactly, he delivers it with such passion, I feel that he actually meant it. The supporting cast are superb, not a weak character or actor, but Pete nails this and it is even more poignant that he played a character riddled with cancer. He will be sadly missed. "Stop this racket, you'll wake up in the next ward". RIP mate.

    May he rest in Peace!This was the best brass music film I have ever seen and it wouldn't be the same without the ill conductor,who overcame his illness and came to conduct the miner's orchestra of the already fired workers of a closed coal mine.The movie enlightens with the beautiful brass music-especially the "William Tell's overture" from Rossini and the spirit of the musicians,who won a nationwide contest of brass orchestras and dedicated their victory to all the miners,who lost their work during the decline of the coal mining in the United Kingdom. The film shows the importance of the art for the existence of the sole human and the society even in times of turmoil.

    I was born into a pit village (Wombwell) and i lived / worked through the miners strike. Not as a miner, but believe me when i say that everyone - EVERYONE who lived in the area at the time was effected in one way or another. The film depicts the relationships that existed at and around the time of the strike and the years that followed. It was a time of turmoil and Brassed Off is spot on in it's depiction of how friends and neighbours / colleagues and workmates / staff employed underground and in management or office roles were at loggerheads. Nothing can ever truly express the feelings and hardship that was the miners strike and the pit closures that followed. Arthur Scargill (figure of hate / love / comedic derision or political leader dependent on your background) was WRONG. Not necessarily in his views but certainly in his prophecy of the future. For even he did not predict the final number of pits that the Thatcherite government would evidentially close. The film is to many a landmark in British movie standards. To pigeon hole this film as a comedy - musical - political dialogue - does not do the film justice. If ever a film ticked all the boxes, this is the one. So sit back and watch a true cinematic epic! And the music (from a heavy metal fan at heart) is fantastic beyond all proportions. If you don't feel overwhelmed by William Tell or if Danny Boy doesn't bring a tear to your eye - then you may as well give up, as the message and the meaning of this film (that the only really important things in life are what you have always taken for granted) are probably why you never understood films such as Kes.

    Brassed Off is a British film about the troubles of a colliery brass band when the coal mines that sponsored the band was forced to close by the government in 1992, the same week the Grimethorpe Colliery Band won the National Brass Band Championship. The closures killed the coal industry in England and forced many miners out of their jobs. "Brassed off" is a British slang expression that means dejected, fed up, upset, which is what the coal miners were when they were forced into retirement, into joblessness, and some even into suicide when the government closed the mines. Between 1990 and 1997, the party in control of the British government was the Conservatives, who were led by John Major, although the film calls them Tories or the Tory party. When the government decided to replace coal with nuclear power as a source of fuel, approximately 140 coal pits, representing more than 200,000 miners' jobs, were deemed redundant. The government offered the workers "redundancy"  forced retirement with severance pay. The film is set in Grimley, a fictitious town that represents the village of Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire, in the early 1990s. In the late 1970s, the European Union named Grimethorpe the poorest village in Britain. The village, however, is still fiercely proud of their brass band that has been in existence since 1881. The film has been criticized by some as a poor imitation of the Yorkshire dialect and accent, but most American audiences wouldn't know the difference. If you like brass band music, you'll enjoy Brassed Off and you'll learn some history about the British government closing the coal mines at the same time (something the U.S. may be forced to do in the not-too-distant future if the environmentalists have their way).

    May he rest in Peace!This was the best brass music film I have ever seen and it wouldn't be the same without the ill conductor,who overcame his illness and came to conduct the miner's orchestra of the already fired workers of a closed coal mine.The movie enlightens with the beautiful brass music-especially the "William Tell's overture" from Rossini and the spirit of the musicians,who won a nationwide contest of brass orchestras and dedicated their victory to all the miners,who lost their work during the decline of the coal mining in the United Kingdom. The film shows the importance of the art for the existence of the sole human and the society even in times of turmoil.

    I was born into a pit village (Wombwell) and i lived / worked through the miners strike. Not as a miner, but believe me when i say that everyone - EVERYONE who lived in the area at the time was effected in one way or another. The film depicts the relationships that existed at and around the time of the strike and the years that followed. It was a time of turmoil and Brassed Off is spot on in it's depiction of how friends and neighbours / colleagues and workmates / staff employed underground and in management or office roles were at loggerheads. Nothing can ever truly express the feelings and hardship that was the miners strike and the pit closures that followed. Arthur Scargill (figure of hate / love / comedic derision or political leader dependent on your background) was WRONG. Not necessarily in his views but certainly in his prophecy of the future. For even he did not predict the final number of pits that the Thatcherite government would evidentially close. The film is to many a landmark in British movie standards. To pigeon hole this film as a comedy - musical - political dialogue - does not do the film justice. If ever a film ticked all the boxes, this is the one. So sit back and watch a true cinematic epic! And the music (from a heavy metal fan at heart) is fantastic beyond all proportions. If you don't feel overwhelmed by William Tell or if Danny Boy doesn't bring a tear to your eye - then you may as well give up, as the message and the meaning of this film (that the only really important things in life are what you have always taken for granted) are probably why you never understood films such as Kes.

    Brassed Off is a British film about the troubles of a colliery brass band when the coal mines that sponsored the band was forced to close by the government in 1992, the same week the Grimethorpe Colliery Band won the National Brass Band Championship. The closures killed the coal industry in England and forced many miners out of their jobs. "Brassed off" is a British slang expression that means dejected, fed up, upset, which is what the coal miners were when they were forced into retirement, into joblessness, and some even into suicide when the government closed the mines. Between 1990 and 1997, the party in control of the British government was the Conservatives, who were led by John Major, although the film calls them Tories or the Tory party. When the government decided to replace coal with nuclear power as a source of fuel, approximately 140 coal pits, representing more than 200,000 miners' jobs, were deemed redundant. The government offered the workers "redundancy"  forced retirement with severance pay. The film is set in Grimley, a fictitious town that represents the village of Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire, in the early 1990s. In the late 1970s, the European Union named Grimethorpe the poorest village in Britain. The village, however, is still fiercely proud of their brass band that has been in existence since 1881. The film has been criticized by some as a poor imitation of the Yorkshire dialect and accent, but most American audiences wouldn't know the difference. If you like brass band music, you'll enjoy Brassed Off and you'll learn some history about the British government closing the coal mines at the same time (something the U.S. may be forced to do in the not-too-distant future if the environmentalists have their way).

    I have been watching Waking the Dead, and thought I would explore other works done by it's stars. I'm starting with Eve (Tara Fitzgerald). The star of this film is not Fitzgerald, but Pete Postlethwaite, who was nominated for an Oscar for In the Name of the Father, and also starred in Inception and The Lost World: Jurassic Park, among others. Postlethwaite is trying to keep a brass band together in the face of coal mines being shut down, which will result in the eventual demise of his town. It is a lighthearted, sometimes depressing film which features a love story between young people (Fitzgerald and Ewan McGregor), a crisis involving a married couple (Stephen Tompkinson and Melanie Hill), and a health crisis involving Danny (Postlethwaite). Of course, there is also a national band contest at the Royal Albert Hall. There is also a bit of politics in the film with a couple of rants against Maggie Thatcher. They even managed to work Danny Boy in the film. Great! I am glad that Fitzgerald brought me here, as it was an enjoyable experience.

    This is British Cinema at its very best and has been my favourite film of all time since I first saw it on the big screen. I cannot think of two more powerful performances committed to celluloid than those of Peter Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson. There is so much emotion in "Brassed Off" that anyone who fails to be moved must have a heart of stone...if indeed they have a heart at all. People I know (or reviews I have read) that didn't like the film have criticised the intense political messages within it, but in my opinion these folk are missing the point entirely. It's true that there is a fierce undercurrent of anti right wing leaning running through the movie, but to portray the characters any other way would be factually inaccurate. Some may view Thatcher as a Saint, but characters like those in Brassed Off can only ever view her as an evil tyrant. Anyway I'm going off on a tangent now. My point is this: Brassed Off is a very humane picture that paints a picture of early eighties folk who have been robbed of their livelihood, yet still manages to be funny, charming, heartwarming, heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. A truly wonderful film.

    The music was absolutely exquisite and the acting excellent. Felt that some elements could have been left out e.g. God-bashing moments, blasphemy which I thought were totally unnecessary and offensive. Does the director/writer/producer have something against the Catholic Church in particular? The speech at the end was quite disappointing for someone with one foot on the grave and it was lacking some type of closure. Yes, I can imagine the frustration of these coal-mine workers as obviously these things have been happening and are still happening all around the world including Australia in the different industries. I have always loved watching English comedy/drama but, this one put me off somewhat and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone quite honestly. Rather buy a CD with similar music and avoid all the non-sensical things by watching movies such as this one.

    For any American worker who may be feeling a bit under-appreciated  relax! No one does working-class anger and analysis like our British cousins from across the sea. Brassed Off takes place in Grimley, a small mining village in Worchestershire, England, threatened by the possibility of their mine closing. Tara Fitzgerald plays Gloria Mullen, a surveyor for the Grimley Mining Company, whose job is to create a study that she thinks will keep Grimley open and save jobs. "My figures show Grimley has a future. It's a profitable pit," she tells Andy, her friend, fellow band member, and old flame. Ewan MacGregor, as Andy Barrow, is one hard realist who schools her in the ways of management's shady plans over coffee one night. "You're report means as much to them as we do. . . bugger all. . . And those good eggs at the head office think they've done all they can. Oh dear. . . they've been very fair, very reasonable. Done their best, done their sums and - oh dear - they just don't add up! They'll have to close another pit  a shame  and they probably made their decision why you were still in college." Gloria can't understand why Andy will vote to keep the mine open then, if the majority of miners will be voting for "redundancy" - to close the mine and take a buy-out. "No hope  just principles", he replies. Amid the backdrop of this drama, Gloria and Andy's budding relationship suffers a few bumps and bruises along the way. A few of the more vocal Grimley Colliery Brass Band members accuse Andy of being a scab and Gloria a management sellout until almost the bitter end. The film intersperses strike scenes and family crisis's with rousing band numbers, as they practice for a musical competition. The late  and great  Peter Postlethwaite, portrays Danny, the orchestra's leader  in good times and bad. The musical numbers represent the spirit of the town as the villagers grapple with their pressure and problems. He encourages the band members to keep going, no matter what, even if it means the further deterioration of his own poor health. Danny believes that the band can win fist prize, which symbolizes their collective spirit - undaunted and unbowed. During her viability study report to management, Gloria discovers that Andy's predictions are all-too accurate, right down to the timing of their decision to close Grimley. Gloria discovers that she too has principles and resigns her cushy position, which ultimately enables the band to travel to the band finals at Albert Hall. The band plays on, all the way to Albert Hall, even though many of the members are cynical and demoralized, knowing that their lives will be forever changed as a result of management's callous actions. And although Grimley closes, Danny and Gloria are able to rally the Grimley Brass Banders to play their hearts out in London at the National Band Competition, winning first place. Danny: ". . .over the last ten years, this bloody government has systematically destroyed an entire industry. OUR industry. And not just our industry - our communities, our homes, our lives. All in the name of "progress". And for a few lousy bob. I'll tell you something else you might not know, as well. A fortnight ago, this band's pit were closed - another thousand men lost their jobs. And that's not all they lost. Most of them lost the will to win a while ago. A few of them even lost the will to fight. But when it comes to losing the will to live, to breathe, the point is - if this lot were seals or whales, you'd all be up in bloody arms. But their not, are they, no, no they're not. They're just ordinary common-or-garden honest, decent human beings. And not one of them with an ounce of bloody hope left. Oh aye, they can knock out a bloody good tune. But what the f*#k does that matter? And now I'm going to take my boys out onto the town. Thank you." See what I mean?

    BRASSED OFF is a 1996 movie from England - written and directed by Mark Herman - in that tradition of those movies about the working classes attempting to better themselves: THE FULLY MONTY, BILLY ELLIOT and MADE IN DAGENHAM being other prominent examples. At the time it seemed like one of the last nails in the coffin of the outgoing Tory government. It's set in a real-looking Yorkshire mining town a few years after the 1984/85 miners strike, where the local coal mine is about to be closed. The miners (Ewan McGregor, Jim Carter, Stephen Tompkinson and others) find solidarity in their brass band under their conductor - retired miner Danny (the late Pete Postlewaite in his finest screen role), a man for whom music matters above all else. The pit closes, but the band makes it to the national brass band competition final at the Albert Hall. On winning, you expect Danny to make some sentimental speech about how - in spite of everything - music holds the band together. Instead, he delivers probably the explicit political diatribe against the then Conservative government and the devastation unemployment inflicts on people. It's a superb moment in a film with its heart and soul in the dying working class communities of Yorkshire. This isn't a piece of Ken Loach-like realism - it's prettified and sentimentalised for a mainstream audience, yet the movie looses nothing for it. At the close, the brass band play Elgar's Pomp and Circumstace March Number 1 as they pass the Houses of Parliament. It's meant to be ironic but it's also very touching.

    Minor spoilers ahoy... Yes I realise this is more a tribute to the man than the film, but frankly I don't care. Steven Spielberg worked with Pete Postlethwaite on Jurassic Park and is quoted as saying Pete was "probably the best actor in the world" and who can disagree? Brassed Off is on TV right now as I type this, being shown in tribute to Pete and in it I believe he reached the pinnacle of his career. I lived through the Thatcher years with miners strikes and the subsequent closer of the pits and heavy industry putting millions on the dole. I was there at a strike meeting held outside a local heavy industry site where thousands were later thrown on the scrap heap. The speech given by Pete at the end of the film sums it up exactly, he delivers it with such passion, I feel that he actually meant it. The supporting cast are superb, not a weak character or actor, but Pete nails this and it is even more poignant that he played a character riddled with cancer. He will be sadly missed. "Stop this racket, you'll wake up in the next ward". RIP mate.

It's set in a real-looking Yorkshire mining town a few years after the 1984/85 miners strike, where the local coal mine is about to be closed. The miners (Ewan McGregor, Jim Carter, Stephen Tompkinson and others) find solidarity in their brass band under their conductor - retired miner Danny (the late Pete Postlewaite in his finest screen role), a man for whom music matters above all else. The pit closes, but the band makes it to the national brass band competition final at the Albert Hall. On winning, you expect Danny to make some sentimental speech about how - in spite of everything - music holds the band together. Instead, he delivers probably the explicit political diatribe against the then Conservative government and the devastation unemployment inflicts on people. It's a superb moment in a film with its heart and soul in the dying working class communities of Yorkshire. This isn't a piece of Ken Loach-like realism - it's prettified and sentimentalised for a mainstream audience, yet the movie looses nothing for it. At the close, the brass band play Elgar's Pomp and Circumstace March Number 1 as they pass the Houses of Parliament. It's meant to be ironic but it's also very touching.

    Minor spoilers ahoy... Yes I realise this is more a tribute to the man than the film, but frankly I don't care. Steven Spielberg worked with Pete Postlethwaite on Jurassic Park and is quoted as saying Pete was "probably the best actor in the world" and who can disagree? Brassed Off is on TV right now as I type this, being shown in tribute to Pete and in it I believe he reached the pinnacle of his career. I lived through the Thatcher years with miners strikes and the subsequent closer of the pits and heavy industry putting millions on the dole. I was there at a strike meeting held outside a local heavy industry site where thousands were later thrown on the scrap heap. The speech given by Pete at the end of the film sums it up exactly, he delivers it with such passion, I feel that he actually meant it. The supporting cast are superb, not a weak character or actor, but Pete nails this and it is even more poignant that he played a character riddled with cancer. He will be sadly missed. "Stop this racket, you'll wake up in the next ward". RIP mate.

    May he rest in Peace!This was the best brass music film I have ever seen and it wouldn't be the same without the ill conductor,who overcame his illness and came to conduct the miner's orchestra of the already fired workers of a closed coal mine.The movie enlightens with the beautiful brass music-especially the "William Tell's overture" from Rossini and the spirit of the musicians,who won a nationwide contest of brass orchestras and dedicated their victory to all the miners,who lost their work during the decline of the coal mining in the United Kingdom. The film shows the importance of the art for the existence of the sole human and the society even in times of turmoil.

    I was born into a pit village (Wombwell) and i lived / worked through the miners strike. Not as a miner, but believe me when i say that everyone - EVERYONE who lived in the area at the time was effected in one way or another. The film depicts the relationships that existed at and around the time of the strike and the years that followed. It was a time of turmoil and Brassed Off is spot on in it's depiction of how friends and neighbours / colleagues and workmates / staff employed underground and in management or office roles were at loggerheads. Nothing can ever truly express the feelings and hardship that was the miners strike and the pit closures that followed. Arthur Scargill (figure of hate / love / comedic derision or political leader dependent on your background) was WRONG. Not necessarily in his views but certainly in his prophecy of the future. For even he did not predict the final number of pits that the Thatcherite government would evidentially close. The film is to many a landmark in British movie standards. To pigeon hole this film as a comedy - musical - political dialogue - does not do the film justice. If ever a film ticked all the boxes, this is the one. So sit back and watch a true cinematic epic! And the music (from a heavy metal fan at heart) is fantastic beyond all proportions. If you don't feel overwhelmed by William Tell or if Danny Boy doesn't bring a tear to your eye - then you may as well give up, as the message and the meaning of this film (that the only really important things in life are what you have always taken for granted) are probably why you never understood films such as Kes.

    Brassed Off is a British film about the troubles of a colliery brass band when the coal mines that sponsored the band was forced to close by the government in 1992, the same week the Grimethorpe Colliery Band won the National Brass Band Championship. The closures killed the coal industry in England and forced many miners out of their jobs. "Brassed off" is a British slang expression that means dejected, fed up, upset, which is what the coal miners were when they were forced into retirement, into joblessness, and some even into suicide when the government closed the mines. Between 1990 and 1997, the party in control of the British government was the Conservatives, who were led by John Major, although the film calls them Tories or the Tory party. When the government decided to replace coal with nuclear power as a source of fuel, approximately 140 coal pits, representing more than 200,000 miners' jobs, were deemed redundant. The government offered the workers "redundancy"  forced retirement with severance pay. The film is set in Grimley, a fictitious town that represents the village of Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire, in the early 1990s. In the late 1970s, the European Union named Grimethorpe the poorest village in Britain. The village, however, is still fiercely proud of their brass band that has been in existence since 1881. The film has been criticized by some as a poor imitation of the Yorkshire dialect and accent, but most American audiences wouldn't know the difference. If you like brass band music, you'll enjoy Brassed Off and you'll learn some history about the British government closing the coal mines at the same time (something the U.S. may be forced to do in the not-too-distant future if the environmentalists have their way).

    I have been watching Waking the Dead, and thought I would explore other works done by it's stars. I'm starting with Eve (Tara Fitzgerald). The star of this film is not Fitzgerald, but Pete Postlethwaite, who was nominated for an Oscar for In the Name of the Father, and also starred in Inception and The Lost World: Jurassic Park, among others. Postlethwaite is trying to keep a brass band together in the face of coal mines being shut down, which will result in the eventual demise of his town. It is a lighthearted, sometimes depressing film which features a love story between young people (Fitzgerald and Ewan McGregor), a crisis involving a married couple (Stephen Tompkinson and Melanie Hill), and a health crisis involving Danny (Postlethwaite). Of course, there is also a national band contest at the Royal Albert Hall. There is also a bit of politics in the film with a couple of rants against Maggie Thatcher. They even managed to work Danny Boy in the film. Great! I am glad that Fitzgerald brought me here, as it was an enjoyable experience.

    This is British Cinema at its very best and has been my favourite film of all time since I first saw it on the big screen. I cannot think of two more powerful performances committed to celluloid than those of Peter Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson. There is so much emotion in "Brassed Off" that anyone who fails to be moved must have a heart of stone...if indeed they have a heart at all. People I know (or reviews I have read) that didn't like the film have criticised the intense political messages within it, but in my opinion these folk are missing the point entirely. It's true that there is a fierce undercurrent of anti right wing leaning running through the movie, but to portray the characters any other way would be factually inaccurate. Some may view Thatcher as a Saint, but characters like those in Brassed Off can only ever view her as an evil tyrant. Anyway I'm going off on a tangent now. My point is this: Brassed Off is a very humane picture that paints a picture of early eighties folk who have been robbed of their livelihood, yet still manages to be funny, charming, heartwarming, heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. A truly wonderful film.

    The music was absolutely exquisite and the acting excellent. Felt that some elements could have been left out e.g. God-bashing moments, blasphemy which I thought were totally unnecessary and offensive. Does the director/writer/producer have something against the Catholic Church in particular? The speech at the end was quite disappointing for someone with one foot on the grave and it was lacking some type of closure. Yes, I can imagine the frustration of these coal-mine workers as obviously these things have been happening and are still happening all around the world including Australia in the different industries. I have always loved watching English comedy/drama but, this one put me off somewhat and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone quite honestly. Rather buy a CD with similar music and avoid all the non-sensical things by watching movies such as this one.

    For any American worker who may be feeling a bit under-appreciated  relax! No one does working-class anger and analysis like our British cousins from across the sea. Brassed Off takes place in Grimley, a small mining village in Worchestershire, England, threatened by the possibility of their mine closing. Tara Fitzgerald plays Gloria Mullen, a surveyor for the Grimley Mining Company, whose job is to create a study that she thinks will keep Grimley open and save jobs. "My figures show Grimley has a future. It's a profitable pit," she tells Andy, her friend, fellow band member, and old flame. Ewan MacGregor, as Andy Barrow, is one hard realist who schools her in the ways of management's shady plans over coffee one night. "You're report means as much to them as we do. . . bugger all. . . And those good eggs at the head office think they've done all they can. Oh dear. . . they've been very fair, very reasonable. Done their best, done their sums and - oh dear - they just don't add up! They'll have to close another pit  a shame  and they probably made their decision why you were still in college." Gloria can't understand why Andy will vote to keep the mine open then, if the majority of miners will be voting for "redundancy" - to close the mine and take a buy-out. "No hope  just principles", he replies. Amid the backdrop of this drama, Gloria and Andy's budding relationship suffers a few bumps and bruises along the way. A few of the more vocal Grimley Colliery Brass Band members accuse Andy of being a scab and Gloria a management sellout until almost the bitter end. The film intersperses strike scenes and family crisis's with rousing band numbers, as they practice for a musical competition. The late  and great  Peter Postlethwaite, portrays Danny, the orchestra's leader  in good times and bad. The musical numbers represent the spirit of the town as the villagers grapple with their pressure and problems. He encourages the band members to keep going, no matter what, even if it means the further deterioration of his own poor health. Danny believes that the band can win fist prize, which symbolizes their collective spirit - undaunted and unbowed. During her viability study report to management, Gloria discovers that Andy's predictions are all-too accurate, right down to the timing of their decision to close Grimley. Gloria discovers that she too has principles and resigns her cushy position, which ultimately enables the band to travel to the band finals at Albert Hall. The band plays on, all the way to Albert Hall, even though many of the members are cynical and demoralized, knowing that their lives will be forever changed as a result of management's callous actions. And although Grimley closes, Danny and Gloria are able to rally the Grimley Brass Banders to play their hearts out in London at the National Band Competition, winning first place. Danny: ". . .over the last ten years, this bloody government has systematically destroyed an entire industry. OUR industry. And not just our industry - our communities, our homes, our lives. All in the name of "progress". And for a few lousy bob. I'll tell you something else you might not know, as well. A fortnight ago, this band's pit were closed - another thousand men lost their jobs. And that's not all they lost. Most of them lost the will to win a while ago. A few of them even lost the will to fight. But when it comes to losing the will to live, to breathe, the point is - if this lot were seals or whales, you'd all be up in bloody arms. But their not, are they, no, no they're not. They're just ordinary common-or-garden honest, decent human beings. And not one of them with an ounce of bloody hope left. Oh aye, they can knock out a bloody good tune. But what the f*#k does that matter? And now I'm going to take my boys out onto the town. Thank you." See what I mean?

    BRASSED OFF is a 1996 movie from England - written and directed by Mark Herman - in that tradition of those movies about the working classes attempting to better themselves: THE FULLY MONTY, BILLY ELLIOT and MADE IN DAGENHAM being other prominent examples. At the time it seemed like one of the last nails in the coffin of the outgoing Tory government. It's set in a real-looking Yorkshire mining town a few years after the 1984/85 miners strike, where the local coal mine is about to be closed. The miners (Ewan McGregor, Jim Carter, Stephen Tompkinson and others) find solidarity in their brass band under their conductor - retired miner Danny (the late Pete Postlewaite in his finest screen role), a man for whom music matters above all else.

It's a superb moment in a film with its heart and soul in the dying working class communities of Yorkshire. This isn't a piece of Ken Loach-like realism - it's prettified and sentimentalised for a mainstream audience, yet the movie looses nothing for it. At the close, the brass band play Elgar's Pomp and Circumstace March Number 1 as they pass the Houses of Parliament. It's meant to be ironic but it's also very touching.

The film intersperses strike scenes and family crisis's with rousing band numbers, as they practice for a musical competition. The late  and great  Peter Postlethwaite, portrays Danny, the orchestra's leader  in good times and bad. The musical numbers represent the spirit of the town as the villagers grapple with their pressure and problems. He encourages the band members to keep going, no matter what, even if it means the further deterioration of his own poor health. Danny believes that the band can win fist prize, which symbolizes their collective spirit - undaunted and unbowed. During her viability study report to management, Gloria discovers that Andy's predictions are all-too accurate, right down to the timing of their decision to close Grimley. Gloria discovers that she too has principles and resigns her cushy position, which ultimately enables the band to travel to the band finals at Albert Hall. The band plays on, all the way to Albert Hall, even though many of the members are cynical and demoralized, knowing that their lives will be forever changed as a result of management's callous actions. And although Grimley closes, Danny and Gloria are able to rally the Grimley Brass Banders to play their hearts out in London at the National Band Competition, winning first place. Danny: ". . .over the last ten years, this bloody government has systematically destroyed an entire industry. OUR industry. And not just our industry - our communities, our homes, our lives. All in the name of "progress". And for a few lousy bob. I'll tell you something else you might not know, as well. A fortnight ago, this band's pit were closed - another thousand men lost their jobs. And that's not all they lost. Most of them lost the will to win a while ago. A few of them even lost the will to fight. But when it comes to losing the will to live, to breathe, the point is - if this lot were seals or whales, you'd all be up in bloody arms. But their not, are they, no, no they're not. They're just ordinary common-or-garden honest, decent human beings. And not one of them with an ounce of bloody hope left. Oh aye, they can knock out a bloody good tune. But what the f*#k does that matter? And now I'm going to take my boys out onto the town. Thank you." See what I mean?

    BRASSED OFF is a 1996 movie from England - written and directed by Mark Herman - in that tradition of those movies about the working classes attempting to better themselves: THE FULLY MONTY, BILLY ELLIOT and MADE IN DAGENHAM being other prominent examples. At the time it seemed like one of the last nails in the coffin of the outgoing Tory government. It's set in a real-looking Yorkshire mining town a few years after the 1984/85 miners strike, where the local coal mine is about to be closed. The miners (Ewan McGregor, Jim Carter, Stephen Tompkinson and others) find solidarity in their brass band under their conductor - retired miner Danny (the late Pete Postlewaite in his finest screen role), a man for whom music matters above all else. The pit closes, but the band makes it to the national brass band competition final at the Albert Hall. On winning, you expect Danny to make some sentimental speech about how - in spite of everything - music holds the band together. Instead, he delivers probably the explicit political diatribe against the then Conservative government and the devastation unemployment inflicts on people. It's a superb moment in a film with its heart and soul in the dying working class communities of Yorkshire. This isn't a piece of Ken Loach-like realism - it's prettified and sentimentalised for a mainstream audience, yet the movie looses nothing for it. At the close, the brass band play Elgar's Pomp and Circumstace March Number 1 as they pass the Houses of Parliament. It's meant to be ironic but it's also very touching.

    Minor spoilers ahoy... Yes I realise this is more a tribute to the man than the film, but frankly I don't care. Steven Spielberg worked with Pete Postlethwaite on Jurassic Park and is quoted as saying Pete was "probably the best actor in the world" and who can disagree? Brassed Off is on TV right now as I type this, being shown in tribute to Pete and in it I believe he reached the pinnacle of his career. I lived through the Thatcher years with miners strikes and the subsequent closer of the pits and heavy industry putting millions on the dole. I was there at a strike meeting held outside a local heavy industry site where thousands were later thrown on the scrap heap. The speech given by Pete at the end of the film sums it up exactly, he delivers it with such passion, I feel that he actually meant it. The supporting cast are superb, not a weak character or actor, but Pete nails this and it is even more poignant that he played a character riddled with cancer. He will be sadly missed. "Stop this racket, you'll wake up in the next ward". RIP mate.

    May he rest in Peace!This was the best brass music film I have ever seen and it wouldn't be the same without the ill conductor,who overcame his illness and came to conduct the miner's orchestra of the already fired workers of a closed coal mine.The movie enlightens with the beautiful brass music-especially the "William Tell's overture" from Rossini and the spirit of the musicians,who won a nationwide contest of brass orchestras and dedicated their victory to all the miners,who lost their work during the decline of the coal mining in the United Kingdom. The film shows the importance of the art for the existence of the sole human and the society even in times of turmoil.

    I was born into a pit village (Wombwell) and i lived / worked through the miners strike. Not as a miner, but believe me when i say that everyone - EVERYONE who lived in the area at the time was effected in one way or another. The film depicts the relationships that existed at and around the time of the strike and the years that followed. It was a time of turmoil and Brassed Off is spot on in it's depiction of how friends and neighbours / colleagues and workmates / staff employed underground and in management or office roles were at loggerheads. Nothing can ever truly express the feelings and hardship that was the miners strike and the pit closures that followed. Arthur Scargill (figure of hate / love / comedic derision or political leader dependent on your background) was WRONG. Not necessarily in his views but certainly in his prophecy of the future. For even he did not predict the final number of pits that the Thatcherite government would evidentially close. The film is to many a landmark in British movie standards. To pigeon hole this film as a comedy - musical - political dialogue - does not do the film justice. If ever a film ticked all the boxes, this is the one. So sit back and watch a true cinematic epic! And the music (from a heavy metal fan at heart) is fantastic beyond all proportions. If you don't feel overwhelmed by William Tell or if Danny Boy doesn't bring a tear to your eye - then you may as well give up, as the message and the meaning of this film (that the only really important things in life are what you have always taken for granted) are probably why you never understood films such as Kes.

    Brassed Off is a British film about the troubles of a colliery brass band when the coal mines that sponsored the band was forced to close by the government in 1992, the same week the Grimethorpe Colliery Band won the National Brass Band Championship. The closures killed the coal industry in England and forced many miners out of their jobs. "Brassed off" is a British slang expression that means dejected, fed up, upset, which is what the coal miners were when they were forced into retirement, into joblessness, and some even into suicide when the government closed the mines. Between 1990 and 1997, the party in control of the British government was the Conservatives, who were led by John Major, although the film calls them Tories or the Tory party. When the government decided to replace coal with nuclear power as a source of fuel, approximately 140 coal pits, representing more than 200,000 miners' jobs, were deemed redundant. The government offered the workers "redundancy"  forced retirement with severance pay. The film is set in Grimley, a fictitious town that represents the village of Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire, in the early 1990s. In the late 1970s, the European Union named Grimethorpe the poorest village in Britain. The village, however, is still fiercely proud of their brass band that has been in existence since 1881. The film has been criticized by some as a poor imitation of the Yorkshire dialect and accent, but most American audiences wouldn't know the difference. If you like brass band music, you'll enjoy Brassed Off and you'll learn some history about the British government closing the coal mines at the same time (something the U.S. may be forced to do in the not-too-distant future if the environmentalists have their way).

    I have been watching Waking the Dead, and thought I would explore other works done by it's stars. I'm starting with Eve (Tara Fitzgerald). The star of this film is not Fitzgerald, but Pete Postlethwaite, who was nominated for an Oscar for In the Name of the Father, and also starred in Inception and The Lost World: Jurassic Park, among others. Postlethwaite is trying to keep a brass band together in the face of coal mines being shut down, which will result in the eventual demise of his town. It is a lighthearted, sometimes depressing film which features a love story between young people (Fitzgerald and Ewan McGregor), a crisis involving a married couple (Stephen Tompkinson and Melanie Hill), and a health crisis involving Danny (Postlethwaite). Of course, there is also a national band contest at the Royal Albert Hall. There is also a bit of politics in the film with a couple of rants against Maggie Thatcher. They even managed to work Danny Boy in the film. Great! I am glad that Fitzgerald brought me here, as it was an enjoyable experience.

    This is British Cinema at its very best and has been my favourite film of all time since I first saw it on the big screen. I cannot think of two more powerful performances committed to celluloid than those of Peter Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson. There is so much emotion in "Brassed Off" that anyone who fails to be moved must have a heart of stone...if indeed they have a heart at all. People I know (or reviews I have read) that didn't like the film have criticised the intense political messages within it, but in my opinion these folk are missing the point entirely. It's true that there is a fierce undercurrent of anti right wing leaning running through the movie, but to portray the characters any other way would be factually inaccurate. Some may view Thatcher as a Saint, but characters like those in Brassed Off can only ever view her as an evil tyrant. Anyway I'm going off on a tangent now. My point is this: Brassed Off is a very humane picture that paints a picture of early eighties folk who have been robbed of their livelihood, yet still manages to be funny, charming, heartwarming, heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. A truly wonderful film.

    The music was absolutely exquisite and the acting excellent. Felt that some elements could have been left out e.g. God-bashing moments, blasphemy which I thought were totally unnecessary and offensive. Does the director/writer/producer have something against the Catholic Church in particular? The speech at the end was quite disappointing for someone with one foot on the grave and it was lacking some type of closure. Yes, I can imagine the frustration of these coal-mine workers as obviously these things have been happening and are still happening all around the world including Australia in the different industries. I have always loved watching English comedy/drama but, this one put me off somewhat and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone quite honestly. Rather buy a CD with similar music and avoid all the non-sensical things by watching movies such as this one.

    For any American worker who may be feeling a bit under-appreciated  relax! No one does working-class anger and analysis like our British cousins from across the sea. Brassed Off takes place in Grimley, a small mining village in Worchestershire, England, threatened by the possibility of their mine closing. Tara Fitzgerald plays Gloria Mullen, a surveyor for the Grimley Mining Company, whose job is to create a study that she thinks will keep Grimley open and save jobs. "My figures show Grimley has a future. It's a profitable pit," she tells Andy, her friend, fellow band member, and old flame. Ewan MacGregor, as Andy Barrow, is one hard realist who schools her in the ways of management's shady plans over coffee one night. "You're report means as much to them as we do. . . bugger all. . . And those good eggs at the head office think they've done all they can. Oh dear. . . they've been very fair, very reasonable. Done their best, done their sums and - oh dear - they just don't add up! They'll have to close another pit  a shame  and they probably made their decision why you were still in college." Gloria can't understand why Andy will vote to keep the mine open then, if the majority of miners will be voting for "redundancy" - to close the mine and take a buy-out. "No hope  just principles", he replies. Amid the backdrop of this drama, Gloria and Andy's budding relationship suffers a few bumps and bruises along the way. A few of the more vocal Grimley Colliery Brass Band members accuse Andy of being a scab and Gloria a management sellout until almost the bitter end. The film intersperses strike scenes and family crisis's with rousing band numbers, as they practice for a musical competition. The late  and great  Peter Postlethwaite, portrays Danny, the orchestra's leader  in good times and bad. The musical numbers represent the spirit of the town as the villagers grapple with their pressure and problems. He encourages the band members to keep going, no matter what, even if it means the further deterioration of his own poor health. Danny believes that the band can win fist prize, which symbolizes their collective spirit - undaunted and unbowed. During her viability study report to management, Gloria discovers that Andy's predictions are all-too accurate, right down to the timing of their decision to close Grimley. Gloria discovers that she too has principles and resigns her cushy position, which ultimately enables the band to travel to the band finals at Albert Hall. The band plays on, all the way to Albert Hall, even though many of the members are cynical and demoralized, knowing that their lives will be forever changed as a result of management's callous actions. And although Grimley closes, Danny and Gloria are able to rally the Grimley Brass Banders to play their hearts out in London at the National Band Competition, winning first place. Danny: ". . .over the last ten years, this bloody government has systematically destroyed an entire industry. OUR industry. And not just our industry - our communities, our homes, our lives. All in the name of "progress". And for a few lousy bob. I'll tell you something else you might not know, as well. A fortnight ago, this band's pit were closed - another thousand men lost their jobs. And that's not all they lost. Most of them lost the will to win a while ago. A few of them even lost the will to fight. But when it comes to losing the will to live, to breathe, the point is - if this lot were seals or whales, you'd all be up in bloody arms. But their not, are they, no, no they're not. They're just ordinary common-or-garden honest, decent human beings. And not one of them with an ounce of bloody hope left. Oh aye, they can knock out a bloody good tune. But what the f*#k does that matter? And now I'm going to take my boys out onto the town. Thank you." See what I mean?

    The music was absolutely exquisite and the acting excellent. Felt that some elements could have been left out e.g. God-bashing moments, blasphemy which I thought were totally unnecessary and offensive. Does the director/writer/producer have something against the Catholic Church in particular? The speech at the end was quite disappointing for someone with one foot on the grave and it was lacking some type of closure. Yes, I can imagine the frustration of these coal-mine workers as obviously these things have been happening and are still happening all around the world including Australia in the different industries. I have always loved watching English comedy/drama but, this one put me off somewhat and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone quite honestly. Rather buy a CD with similar music and avoid all the non-sensical things by watching movies such as this one.

    For any American worker who may be feeling a bit under-appreciated  relax! No one does working-class anger and analysis like our British cousins from across the sea. Brassed Off takes place in Grimley, a small mining village in Worchestershire, England, threatened by the possibility of their mine closing. Tara Fitzgerald plays Gloria Mullen, a surveyor for the Grimley Mining Company, whose job is to create a study that she thinks will keep Grimley open and save jobs. "My figures show Grimley has a future. It's a profitable pit," she tells Andy, her friend, fellow band member, and old flame. Ewan MacGregor, as Andy Barrow, is one hard realist who schools her in the ways of management's shady plans over coffee one night. "You're report means as much to them as we do. . . bugger all. . . And those good eggs at the head office think they've done all they can. Oh dear. . . they've been very fair, very reasonable. Done their best, done their sums and - oh dear - they just don't add up! They'll have to close another pit  a shame  and they probably made their decision why you were still in college." Gloria can't understand why Andy will vote to keep the mine open then, if the majority of miners will be voting for "redundancy" - to close the mine and take a buy-out. "No hope  just principles", he replies. Amid the backdrop of this drama, Gloria and Andy's budding relationship suffers a few bumps and bruises along the way. A few of the more vocal Grimley Colliery Brass Band members accuse Andy of being a scab and Gloria a management sellout until almost the bitter end. The film intersperses strike scenes and family crisis's with rousing band numbers, as they practice for a musical competition. The late  and great  Peter Postlethwaite, portrays Danny, the orchestra's leader  in good times and bad. The musical numbers represent the spirit of the town as the villagers grapple with their pressure and problems. He encourages the band members to keep going, no matter what, even if it means the further deterioration of his own poor health. Danny believes that the band can win fist prize, which symbolizes their collective spirit - undaunted and unbowed. During her viability study report to management, Gloria discovers that Andy's predictions are all-too accurate, right down to the timing of their decision to close Grimley. Gloria discovers that she too has principles and resigns her cushy position, which ultimately enables the band to travel to the band finals at Albert Hall. The band plays on, all the way to Albert Hall, even though many of the members are cynical and demoralized, knowing that their lives will be forever changed as a result of management's callous actions. And although Grimley closes, Danny and Gloria are able to rally the Grimley Brass Banders to play their hearts out in London at the National Band Competition, winning first place. Danny: ". . .over the last ten years, this bloody government has systematically destroyed an entire industry. OUR industry. And not just our industry - our communities, our homes, our lives. All in the name of "progress". And for a few lousy bob. I'll tell you something else you might not know, as well. A fortnight ago, this band's pit were closed - another thousand men lost their jobs. And that's not all they lost. Most of them lost the will to win a while ago. A few of them even lost the will to fight. But when it comes to losing the will to live, to breathe, the point is - if this lot were seals or whales, you'd all be up in bloody arms. But their not, are they, no, no they're not. They're just ordinary common-or-garden honest, decent human beings. And not one of them with an ounce of bloody hope left. Oh aye, they can knock out a bloody good tune. But what the f*#k does that matter? And now I'm going to take my boys out onto the town. Thank you." See what I mean?

    BRASSED OFF is a 1996 movie from England - written and directed by Mark Herman - in that tradition of those movies about the working classes attempting to better themselves: THE FULLY MONTY, BILLY ELLIOT and MADE IN DAGENHAM being other prominent examples. At the time it seemed like one of the last nails in the coffin of the outgoing Tory government. It's set in a real-looking Yorkshire mining town a few years after the 1984/85 miners strike, where the local coal mine is about to be closed. The miners (Ewan McGregor, Jim Carter, Stephen Tompkinson and others) find solidarity in their brass band under their conductor - retired miner Danny (the late Pete Postlewaite in his finest screen role), a man for whom music matters above all else. The pit closes, but the band makes it to the national brass band competition final at the Albert Hall. On winning, you expect Danny to make some sentimental speech about how - in spite of everything - music holds the band together. Instead, he delivers probably the explicit political diatribe against the then Conservative government and the devastation unemployment inflicts on people. It's a superb moment in a film with its heart and soul in the dying working class communities of Yorkshire. This isn't a piece of Ken Loach-like realism - it's prettified and sentimentalised for a mainstream audience, yet the movie looses nothing for it. At the close, the brass band play Elgar's Pomp and Circumstace March Number 1 as they pass the Houses of Parliament. It's meant to be ironic but it's also very touching.

    Minor spoilers ahoy... Yes I realise this is more a tribute to the man than the film, but frankly I don't care. Steven Spielberg worked with Pete Postlethwaite on Jurassic Park and is quoted as saying Pete was "probably the best actor in the world" and who can disagree? Brassed Off is on TV right now as I type this, being shown in tribute to Pete and in it I believe he reached the pinnacle of his career. I lived through the Thatcher years with miners strikes and the subsequent closer of the pits and heavy industry putting millions on the dole. I was there at a strike meeting held outside a local heavy industry site where thousands were later thrown on the scrap heap. The speech given by Pete at the end of the film sums it up exactly, he delivers it with such passion, I feel that he actually meant it. The supporting cast are superb, not a weak character or actor, but Pete nails this and it is even more poignant that he played a character riddled with cancer. He will be sadly missed. "Stop this racket, you'll wake up in the next ward". RIP mate.

    May he rest in Peace!This was the best brass music film I have ever seen and it wouldn't be the same without the ill conductor,who overcame his illness and came to conduct the miner's orchestra of the already fired workers of a closed coal mine.The movie enlightens with the beautiful brass music-especially the "William Tell's overture" from Rossini and the spirit of the musicians,who won a nationwide contest of brass orchestras and dedicated their victory to all the miners,who lost their work during the decline of the coal mining in the United Kingdom. The film shows the importance of the art for the existence of the sole human and the society even in times of turmoil.

    I was born into a pit village (Wombwell) and i lived / worked through the miners strike. Not as a miner, but believe me when i say that everyone - EVERYONE who lived in the area at the time was effected in one way or another. The film depicts the relationships that existed at and around the time of the strike and the years that followed. It was a time of turmoil and Brassed Off is spot on in it's depiction of how friends and neighbours / colleagues and workmates / staff employed underground and in management or office roles were at loggerheads. Nothing can ever truly express the feelings and hardship that was the miners strike and the pit closures that followed. Arthur Scargill (figure of hate / love / comedic derision or political leader dependent on your background) was WRONG. Not necessarily in his views but certainly in his prophecy of the future. For even he did not predict the final number of pits that the Thatcherite government would evidentially close. The film is to many a landmark in British movie standards. To pigeon hole this film as a comedy - musical - political dialogue - does not do the film justice. If ever a film ticked all the boxes, this is the one. So sit back and watch a true cinematic epic! And the music (from a heavy metal fan at heart) is fantastic beyond all proportions. If you don't feel overwhelmed by William Tell or if Danny Boy doesn't bring a tear to your eye - then you may as well give up, as the message and the meaning of this film (that the only really important things in life are what you have always taken for granted) are probably why you never understood films such as Kes.

    Brassed Off is a British film about the troubles of a colliery brass band when the coal mines that sponsored the band was forced to close by the government in 1992, the same week the Grimethorpe Colliery Band won the National Brass Band Championship. The closures killed the coal industry in England and forced many miners out of their jobs. "Brassed off" is a British slang expression that means dejected, fed up, upset, which is what the coal miners were when they were forced into retirement, into joblessness, and some even into suicide when the government closed the mines. Between 1990 and 1997, the party in control of the British government was the Conservatives, who were led by John Major, although the film calls them Tories or the Tory party. When the government decided to replace coal with nuclear power as a source of fuel, approximately 140 coal pits, representing more than 200,000 miners' jobs, were deemed redundant. The government offered the workers "redundancy"  forced retirement with severance pay. The film is set in Grimley, a fictitious town that represents the village of Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire, in the early 1990s. In the late 1970s, the European Union named Grimethorpe the poorest village in Britain. The village, however, is still fiercely proud of their brass band that has been in existence since 1881. The film has been criticized by some as a poor imitation of the Yorkshire dialect and accent, but most American audiences wouldn't know the difference. If you like brass band music, you'll enjoy Brassed Off and you'll learn some history about the British government closing the coal mines at the same time (something the U.S. may be forced to do in the not-too-distant future if the environmentalists have their way).

    I have been watching Waking the Dead, and thought I would explore other works done by it's stars. I'm starting with Eve (Tara Fitzgerald). The star of this film is not Fitzgerald, but Pete Postlethwaite, who was nominated for an Oscar for In the Name of the Father, and also starred in Inception and The Lost World: Jurassic Park, among others. Postlethwaite is trying to keep a brass band together in the face of coal mines being shut down, which will result in the eventual demise of his town. It is a lighthearted, sometimes depressing film which features a love story between young people (Fitzgerald and Ewan McGregor), a crisis involving a married couple (Stephen Tompkinson and Melanie Hill), and a health crisis involving Danny (Postlethwaite). Of course, there is also a national band contest at the Royal Albert Hall. There is also a bit of politics in the film with a couple of rants against Maggie Thatcher. They even managed to work Danny Boy in the film. Great! I am glad that Fitzgerald brought me here, as it was an enjoyable experience.

    *Spoiler/plot- Brassed Off, 1996. A 100 years old coal miners brass band members hit economic and social troubles when their coal mine's labor problems threaten to shut the mine down along with the band organization. *Special Stars- Pete Postlewaite, Ewan McGregor, Jim Carter. *Theme- Taking a social stand and speaking out is as important as making band music. *Trivia/location/goofs- UK, Yorshire. This film's band music caused a resurgence of interest in band music. Wtach this film for first-time on camera performances for many British and Scotish leading character actors. *Emotion- A thoroughly enjoyable character driven film plot about regular people's struggles with work, family and goals. It's a memorable film for it's themes, good casting, writing, and production.

    This is British Cinema at its very best and has been my favourite film of all time since I first saw it on the big screen. I cannot think of two more powerful performances committed to celluloid than those of Peter Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson. There is so much emotion in "Brassed Off" that anyone who fails to be moved must have a heart of stone...if indeed they have a heart at all. People I know (or reviews I have read) that didn't like the film have criticised the intense political messages within it, but in my opinion these folk are missing the point entirely. It's true that there is a fierce undercurrent of anti right wing leaning running through the movie, but to portray the characters any other way would be factually inaccurate. Some may view Thatcher as a Saint, but characters like those in Brassed Off can only ever view her as an evil tyrant. Anyway I'm going off on a tangent now. My point is this: Brassed Off is a very humane picture that paints a picture of early eighties folk who have been robbed of their livelihood, yet still manages to be funny, charming, heartwarming, heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. A truly wonderful film.

    The music was absolutely exquisite and the acting excellent. Felt that some elements could have been left out e.g. God-bashing moments, blasphemy which I thought were totally unnecessary and offensive. Does the director/writer/producer have something against the Catholic Church in particular? The speech at the end was quite disappointing for someone with one foot on the grave and it was lacking some type of closure. Yes, I can imagine the frustration of these coal-mine workers as obviously these things have been happening and are still happening all around the world including Australia in the different industries. I have always loved watching English comedy/drama but, this one put me off somewhat and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone quite honestly.

    This is British Cinema at its very best and has been my favourite film of all time since I first saw it on the big screen. I cannot think of two more powerful performances committed to celluloid than those of Peter Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson. There is so much emotion in "Brassed Off" that anyone who fails to be moved must have a heart of stone...if indeed they have a heart at all. People I know (or reviews I have read) that didn't like the film have criticised the intense political messages within it, but in my opinion these folk are missing the point entirely. It's true that there is a fierce undercurrent of anti right wing leaning running through the movie, but to portray the characters any other way would be factually inaccurate. Some may view Thatcher as a Saint, but characters like those in Brassed Off can only ever view her as an evil tyrant. Anyway I'm going off on a tangent now. My point is this: Brassed Off is a very humane picture that paints a picture of early eighties folk who have been robbed of their livelihood, yet still manages to be funny, charming, heartwarming, heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. A truly wonderful film.

    The music was absolutely exquisite and the acting excellent. Felt that some elements could have been left out e.g. God-bashing moments, blasphemy which I thought were totally unnecessary and offensive. Does the director/writer/producer have something against the Catholic Church in particular? The speech at the end was quite disappointing for someone with one foot on the grave and it was lacking some type of closure. Yes, I can imagine the frustration of these coal-mine workers as obviously these things have been happening and are still happening all around the world including Australia in the different industries. I have always loved watching English comedy/drama but, this one put me off somewhat and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone quite honestly. Rather buy a CD with similar music and avoid all the non-sensical things by watching movies such as this one.

    For any American worker who may be feeling a bit under-appreciated  relax! No one does working-class anger and analysis like our British cousins from across the sea. Brassed Off takes place in Grimley, a small mining village in Worchestershire, England, threatened by the possibility of their mine closing. Tara Fitzgerald plays Gloria Mullen, a surveyor for the Grimley Mining Company, whose job is to create a study that she thinks will keep Grimley open and save jobs. "My figures show Grimley has a future. It's a profitable pit," she tells Andy, her friend, fellow band member, and old flame. Ewan MacGregor, as Andy Barrow, is one hard realist who schools her in the ways of management's shady plans over coffee one night. "You're report means as much to them as we do. . . bugger all. . . And those good eggs at the head office think they've done all they can. Oh dear. . . they've been very fair, very reasonable. Done their best, done their sums and - oh dear - they just don't add up! They'll have to close another pit  a shame  and they probably made their decision why you were still in college." Gloria can't understand why Andy will vote to keep the mine open then, if the majority of miners will be voting for "redundancy" - to close the mine and take a buy-out. "No hope  just principles", he replies. Amid the backdrop of this drama, Gloria and Andy's budding relationship suffers a few bumps and bruises along the way. A few of the more vocal Grimley Colliery Brass Band members accuse Andy of being a scab and Gloria a management sellout until almost the bitter end. The film intersperses strike scenes and family crisis's with rousing band numbers, as they practice for a musical competition. The late  and great  Peter Postlethwaite, portrays Danny, the orchestra's leader  in good times and bad. The musical numbers represent the spirit of the town as the villagers grapple with their pressure and problems. He encourages the band members to keep going, no matter what, even if it means the further deterioration of his own poor health. Danny believes that the band can win fist prize, which symbolizes their collective spirit - undaunted and unbowed. During her viability study report to management, Gloria discovers that Andy's predictions are all-too accurate, right down to the timing of their decision to close Grimley. Gloria discovers that she too has principles and resigns her cushy position, which ultimately enables the band to travel to the band finals at Albert Hall. The band plays on, all the way to Albert Hall, even though many of the members are cynical and demoralized, knowing that their lives will be forever changed as a result of management's callous actions. And although Grimley closes, Danny and Gloria are able to rally the Grimley Brass Banders to play their hearts out in London at the National Band Competition, winning first place. Danny: ". . .over the last ten years, this bloody government has systematically destroyed an entire industry. OUR industry. And not just our industry - our communities, our homes, our lives. All in the name of "progress". And for a few lousy bob. I'll tell you something else you might not know, as well. A fortnight ago, this band's pit were closed - another thousand men lost their jobs. And that's not all they lost. Most of them lost the will to win a while ago. A few of them even lost the will to fight. But when it comes to losing the will to live, to breathe, the point is - if this lot were seals or whales, you'd all be up in bloody arms. But their not, are they, no, no they're not. They're just ordinary common-or-garden honest, decent human beings. And not one of them with an ounce of bloody hope left. Oh aye, they can knock out a bloody good tune. But what the f*#k does that matter? And now I'm going to take my boys out onto the town. Thank you." See what I mean?

    BRASSED OFF is a 1996 movie from England - written and directed by Mark Herman - in that tradition of those movies about the working classes attempting to better themselves: THE FULLY MONTY, BILLY ELLIOT and MADE IN DAGENHAM being other prominent examples. At the time it seemed like one of the last nails in the coffin of the outgoing Tory government. It's set in a real-looking Yorkshire mining town a few years after the 1984/85 miners strike, where the local coal mine is about to be closed. The miners (Ewan McGregor, Jim Carter, Stephen Tompkinson and others) find solidarity in their brass band under their conductor - retired miner Danny (the late Pete Postlewaite in his finest screen role), a man for whom music matters above all else. The pit closes, but the band makes it to the national brass band competition final at the Albert Hall. On winning, you expect Danny to make some sentimental speech about how - in spite of everything - music holds the band together. Instead, he delivers probably the explicit political diatribe against the then Conservative government and the devastation unemployment inflicts on people. It's a superb moment in a film with its heart and soul in the dying working class communities of Yorkshire. This isn't a piece of Ken Loach-like realism - it's prettified and sentimentalised for a mainstream audience, yet the movie looses nothing for it. At the close, the brass band play Elgar's Pomp and Circumstace March Number 1 as they pass the Houses of Parliament. It's meant to be ironic but it's also very touching.

    Minor spoilers ahoy... Yes I realise this is more a tribute to the man than the film, but frankly I don't care. Steven Spielberg worked with Pete Postlethwaite on Jurassic Park and is quoted as saying Pete was "probably the best actor in the world" and who can disagree? Brassed Off is on TV right now as I type this, being shown in tribute to Pete and in it I believe he reached the pinnacle of his career. I lived through the Thatcher years with miners strikes and the subsequent closer of the pits and heavy industry putting millions on the dole. I was there at a strike meeting held outside a local heavy industry site where thousands were later thrown on the scrap heap. The speech given by Pete at the end of the film sums it up exactly, he delivers it with such passion, I feel that he actually meant it. The supporting cast are superb, not a weak character or actor, but Pete nails this and it is even more poignant that he played a character riddled with cancer. He will be sadly missed. "Stop this racket, you'll wake up in the next ward". RIP mate.

    May he rest in Peace!This was the best brass music film I have ever seen and it wouldn't be the same without the ill conductor,who overcame his illness and came to conduct the miner's orchestra of the already fired workers of a closed coal mine.The movie enlightens with the beautiful brass music-especially the "William Tell's overture" from Rossini and the spirit of the musicians,who won a nationwide contest of brass orchestras and dedicated their victory to all the miners,who lost their work during the decline of the coal mining in the United Kingdom. The film shows the importance of the art for the existence of the sole human and the society even in times of turmoil.

    I was born into a pit village (Wombwell) and i lived / worked through the miners strike. Not as a miner, but believe me when i say that everyone - EVERYONE who lived in the area at the time was effected in one way or another. The film depicts the relationships that existed at and around the time of the strike and the years that followed. It was a time of turmoil and Brassed Off is spot on in it's depiction of how friends and neighbours / colleagues and workmates / staff employed underground and in management or office roles were at loggerheads. Nothing can ever truly express the feelings and hardship that was the miners strike and the pit closures that followed. Arthur Scargill (figure of hate / love / comedic derision or political leader dependent on your background) was WRONG. Not necessarily in his views but certainly in his prophecy of the future. For even he did not predict the final number of pits that the Thatcherite government would evidentially close. The film is to many a landmark in British movie standards. To pigeon hole this film as a comedy - musical - political dialogue - does not do the film justice. If ever a film ticked all the boxes, this is the one. So sit back and watch a true cinematic epic! And the music (from a heavy metal fan at heart) is fantastic beyond all proportions. If you don't feel overwhelmed by William Tell or if Danny Boy doesn't bring a tear to your eye - then you may as well give up, as the message and the meaning of this film (that the only really important things in life are what you have always taken for granted) are probably why you never understood films such as Kes.

    Brassed Off is a British film about the troubles of a colliery brass band when the coal mines that sponsored the band was forced to close by the government in 1992, the same week the Grimethorpe Colliery Band won the National Brass Band Championship. The closures killed the coal industry in England and forced many miners out of their jobs. "Brassed off" is a British slang expression that means dejected, fed up, upset, which is what the coal miners were when they were forced into retirement, into joblessness, and some even into suicide when the government closed the mines. Between 1990 and 1997, the party in control of the British government was the Conservatives, who were led by John Major, although the film calls them Tories or the Tory party. When the government decided to replace coal with nuclear power as a source of fuel, approximately 140 coal pits, representing more than 200,000 miners' jobs, were deemed redundant. The government offered the workers "redundancy"  forced retirement with severance pay. The film is set in Grimley, a fictitious town that represents the village of Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire, in the early 1990s. In the late 1970s, the European Union named Grimethorpe the poorest village in Britain. The village, however, is still fiercely proud of their brass band that has been in existence since 1881. The film has been criticized by some as a poor imitation of the Yorkshire dialect and accent, but most American audiences wouldn't know the difference. If you like brass band music, you'll enjoy Brassed Off and you'll learn some history about the British government closing the coal mines at the same time (something the U.S. may be forced to do in the not-too-distant future if the environmentalists have their way).
