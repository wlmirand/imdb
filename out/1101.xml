 <sinopse>
  An affluent New York couple find their lives touched, intruded upon, and compelled by a mysterious young black man who is never quite who he says he is.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  New Yorkers Ouisa and Flan Kittredge are upper class private art dealers, pretentious but compassionate. Their prized possession is a double sided Kandinsky, one side that represents control, the other side chaos. They relay a story to their friends and acquaintances that over time becomes legendary. It is their encounter with a young black man who they had never met or heard of but who comes stumbling upon their front door one evening as they are courting an important investor, Geoffrey Miller, who could make them wealthy beyond what they could have dreamed. That black man is Paul Poitier, who has just arrived in the city, was just mugged outside their building and is sporting a minor knife wound to the abdomen. He is a friend of the Kittredge's children, who are attending Harvard, but more importantly is the son of actor/director . Tomorrow, Paul is meeting up with his father who is in town directing a movie of "Cats". Beyond the attraction of talking Paul into getting...

    Six degrees of separation So there's this guy. He is just right. Then he goes to this couple's house and cooks them dinner and they all have a nice talk about art and books. Ian McClellan is there and he is trying to be South African but knows his accent is bad so doesn't say much. Then it is morning and the woman finds the nice guy bumming a stranger in the bedroom. Then everyone flips out and Donald Sutherland picks up all his trinkets. Then the next hour of the film is the couple telling a story. They tell the story to the kids who are SEETHING about them giving away the pink shirt which was for his new body. So then the newspaper says that the first guy, the nice guy, bummed some other guy and took his money after they danced in the rainbow room which is so unfair because he was just being nice as usual and likes a nice bumming. Then after a few more cocktail parties and stories the nice guy calls up "Weezer" the lady and says, you are my father do you want me to make you dinner again then they get stuck in traffic and Donald Sutherland cares about the nice guy when they see him get arrested but then he doesn't care anymore because really he is heartless and just wants to sell art to foreigners who don't even want to buy the art and just want to hear about the nice boy. Then Weezer is upset because she can't find the nice guy because he is a liar and is schizophrenic and he has hanged himself (probably) with the pink shirt in a prison but she is not family. Then she screams at Donald who tries to say "just let the lady buy the art " but she is having none of it and goes and looks at the flowers and then it ends. 3/10

    Of all the movies I've seen this one has to be the most contrived and pretentious. Like the fast paced and totally unbelievable dialogue for the 60s sitcom "'MASH" this movie is like that on steroids. In a nutshell, PEOPLE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT! The best way to describe is it's a combination of that annoying snappy, quick witted, (again) unrealistic dialogue of Neil Simon AND (try to visualize) Woody Allen lampooning people who are impressed by their own self importance. The characters are either obnoxious or self absorbed. I find all the characters to be incredibly self important. It's a horrible movie and felt the need to shower when it was over, yecccccch. While watching the film I continued to ask myself .."what is this"? Now the good news ,,, it's so bad that its a must see, looking at other reviews on this site I seem to be in the minority. Of. Ourselves it's others who are full of themselves too, Sorry guys I'm right and you're wrong . I grade this movie F? And the F stands for something else

    i voted this film very highly, an 8 to be exact. i might be the only one that thought Will Smith did a fine job within this movie. His character rehearsed his lines, therefore sounding rehearsed. So that robotic argument is virtually out the window, considering that's what his character was to be and sound like. Did anyone write about the possibility of Paul having any mental illness? It seems like people missed that the character of "Paul" needed mental help and that is one main reason louisa or oisa or whatever her name was felt for the kid. She was also impressed with his ability to learn so much and be able to change his way of speech and become so articulate in a matter of just 3 months. Personally, i cant think of a movie i've seen where i thought Donald Sutherland ever did a bad job either. I will agree with one thing though, the acting of the "kids" of each family was god awful.

    Nearly 20 years ago, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION should be regarded as Will Smith's breakthrough role into the mainstream Hollywood, the film is adapted by a renowned play by John Guare, directed by Aussie Fred Schepisi (from A CRY IN THE DARK 1988) and Channing reprises her role in the film edition which has guaranteed her sole Oscar nomination so far. Ever since the opening strain, there are echoes of high-class snootiness abounds which sets the keynote of the whole conversation-foiled phoniness among its quite antipathetic characters, namely the Kittredge couple, then when Will Smith's young intruder emerges, the tension never alleviates although it seems that from the surface the harmony is unfeigned at the beginning and Smith's identity as Sidney Poiter's son is ever questioned, simply since he knows their children's name and his eloquent run-down of his father's filmography, but presented by Smith's black color, the unspeakable sensitivity of racism is well-written and underscored. Added that the paraphrase of CATCHER IN THE RYE is more or less a stratagem of showboating, so when all the boast ends, the ugly truth manifests himself, a satirically comedic story continues with a welter of less spectacular vignettes. Written from a true story, John Guare's screenplay is less staggering than the integral cast, Channing is superb in her final revelation scene but elsewhere, her ability is curbed and sometimes even a bit OTT, Sutherland is more natural and his role is much worse in both moral and ethnic gauges, still another great performance for his undervalued career. Will Smith is the linchpin to influence his low-life leverage onto these upmarket snobs, his performance is not so astonishing on account of the greenness and rawness, but he is luminous in front of cameras, although the fake gay-kiss is a let-down, Hollywood's conservationism is just as dreadful and stinking as its unimaginative blockbuster monopoly. Funny thing is that in the film, Smith make a spiel on the importance of the supremacy of imagination, which plays a grave part in distinguishing human from other species, but now has being over-abused in the mundane media, but the whole theory is too feeble to be taken seriously, neither by upper class nor by those less self-concerned great amount of masses. So who is the real audience of the film? The filmmakers behind it had not a clue! PS: a young J.J. Abrams is in the film as well, as an actor, who could expect that?

    Though "Six Degrees of Separation" is not something I would call extraordinary, the story is no doubt among one of the most creative kind, while the powerful performances are no less important to present such a story. Will Smith plays the mysterious guy, somehow trying to spend a short period of time with people he does not know. Perhaps the purpose is questionable here, but it does not seem fraud is the reason. Somewhere along the line of a creative story, we are given powerful performances. Will Smith is incredible and so is Stockard Channing who plays a wife who comes into contact with the mysterious guy.

    "Six Degrees of Separation" is about a rich fifth avenue couple, the Kittredge's, who are conned by a young black man one night and spend the next few weeks finding out as much as they can about this boy. They go around telling the story to everyone they come across and find friends who went through the same experience days before. The movie is very slow moving, with many of the important scenes carried out through endless dialogue and very little else going on. Originally being a stage piece, the heavy dialogue is to be expected; however, the adaptation to screen leaves you wanting a little more. In spite of it's flaws, "Six Degrees of Separation" gives an interesting insight on how superficial lives can be and how we sometimes take what we have for granted.

    Occupy Wall Street might use this film for fund raisers. It presents the livIng hell of being rich and shallow, and it gives me the creeps much more today than it did when I first saw it. There are some interesting references that date it. For example, the Rainbow Room ejects Will Smith for dancing the tango with a male friend, an act which no such NYC establishment would likely do today. Along those lines, Michael Anthony Hall hands in a very courageous performance as the gay kid who falls for Will and sets his antics in motion. I remember how sensational that kiss between them seemed at the time. Will's character has universal appeal. He is the ultimate con man and hustler, but he is so successful because he is charming. Maybe if rich people today would allow themselves to fall for what is charming, they would delight in helping the struggling people of the world today rather than worrying so much about selling their Kandinskys. Stockard Channing turns in one of the great film performances of the century, showing how a One-Percenter can experience a spiritual epiphany. In this sense, Guare is a modern Dickens, deserving of all the accolades he received for this script and screen play, which reminds us that we are six degrees of separation not only from Kevin Bacon but of every kid in Zuccotti Park or Tahrir Square. "How much of your life can you account for?" With tears in her eyes, Stockard Channing asks Donald Sutherland this question with the same direness in her voice that Jesus must have had when he addressed the rich guys in the Holy Land.

    This is a disgusting movie with so many phony hypocrites in it. If you treat it as a social satire but in reality, you just couldn't find so many disgusting human beings in one city. If New York was targeted as the hypocrites center of the universe as the movie itself described, then you must keep away from this cesspool of phonies. I just couldn't hang on to watch this movie, because almost in any moment I might puke. The characters were so disgusting, so exaggerated, so dramatically ballooned into so self-important pretentious. If rich people could become so disgustingly inhuman, then I'd rather stay in poverty. At first, I thought this movie was with a touch of Woody Allen's movies, but then I've found out this was a totally different beast, a twisted and mutant interpretation of the rich and the rich wannabes. The dialog was just so over-the-top pretentious and obnoxious that hurt every nerve of my hearing. Could be people become so pathetic that they would have to sit down or stand around to listen to the crap of the couple and the phony young guy played by Will Smith? Who would be so stupid to suffer such torment crap out by these people? This movie is a complete ridiculous joke!

    I have gained new respect for Will Smith, as an actor, after this movie. Not that I didn't have much before As much as I adore his personality among other talents, I really didn't expect him to pull off this role with such ease. Considering the difficulty. Paul is one of our main characters, who suddenly appears at a rich couple's home (who are art dealers). He's stabbed after a mugging and dressed in fine clothing, he claims to be the couple's son and daughter's friend from Harvard. After going through detailed knowledge about their children, he woos the dealers and their business guest with his charm, knowledge, and deep insight into the world (at this point Will Smith delivers some great monologue). Later the plot ensues and you find out the Paul is not who he claims to be and the mystery unravels through dinner conversation and anecdote. This movie is based on a play, and through the movie you can clearly see the strength of the dialog carries the story as well as the actors who deliver them. I love the movie for its depth in simplicity. How it uses conversation to draw you in rather than the typical action. It uses conversation to reveal the action and mystery that you so desire. My favorite character in the movie is Ouisa Kittredge played by Stockard Channing. She's the main character who is closest to Paul and grows after this experience with Paul. Do not be mistaken, this movie is NOT about a bunch of rich snobs coming to their way after being exposed to a black boy with promise and potential but no means. No, there is perhaps 5% of that in this movie, and there is no strong pretenses with this film. It goes deeper than just a sympathetic rich white lady, much deeper indeed. This film may not be for everyone, but it is for those who love good dialogs and monologues and for those who love plays ( or at least don't mind them). (the kid's were stupid and pointless one dimensional characters, but that's my only qualm).

    I guess we can see the genius of Will Smith right from the start. This is a film about a chameleon who is able to create for himself identities suited to an intriguing game he is playing. He really wants to be loved, but has become so deeply entrenched in his charade that he soon isn't sure what he wants. He is a master of subterfuge with a smile and a wink. He claims to be the son of someone who is relatively reclusive and unapproachable. This gives him the opportunity to invade people's lives; but for what? It's his "victims" that grow because of him. He is searching for a family but needs so many assurances. He chooses the super-rich, which makes his job much harder. The performances by Donald Sutherland, Stockard Channing, and Smith, himself are quite incredible. I began by absolutely hating these people. They are so smug and pretentious that they make one gag. And that's why their redemption due to this invader is so poignant. They grow to love this young man in their own ways, despite the fact that he appears dangerous (is he; I don't know). Of course, the six degrees is the theory that we are all related in some way if we go back six generations. The thing asked is, how can we then be so different. A real surprise.

He's stabbed after a mugging and dressed in fine clothing, he claims to be the couple's son and daughter's friend from Harvard. After going through detailed knowledge about their children, he woos the dealers and their business guest with his charm, knowledge, and deep insight into the world (at this point Will Smith delivers some great monologue). Later the plot ensues and you find out the Paul is not who he claims to be and the mystery unravels through dinner conversation and anecdote. This movie is based on a play, and through the movie you can clearly see the strength of the dialog carries the story as well as the actors who deliver them. I love the movie for its depth in simplicity. How it uses conversation to draw you in rather than the typical action. It uses conversation to reveal the action and mystery that you so desire. My favorite character in the movie is Ouisa Kittredge played by Stockard Channing. She's the main character who is closest to Paul and grows after this experience with Paul. Do not be mistaken, this movie is NOT about a bunch of rich snobs coming to their way after being exposed to a black boy with promise and potential but no means. No, there is perhaps 5% of that in this movie, and there is no strong pretenses with this film. It goes deeper than just a sympathetic rich white lady, much deeper indeed. This film may not be for everyone, but it is for those who love good dialogs and monologues and for those who love plays ( or at least don't mind them). (the kid's were stupid and pointless one dimensional characters, but that's my only qualm).

    I guess we can see the genius of Will Smith right from the start. This is a film about a chameleon who is able to create for himself identities suited to an intriguing game he is playing. He really wants to be loved, but has become so deeply entrenched in his charade that he soon isn't sure what he wants. He is a master of subterfuge with a smile and a wink. He claims to be the son of someone who is relatively reclusive and unapproachable. This gives him the opportunity to invade people's lives; but for what? It's his "victims" that grow because of him. He is searching for a family but needs so many assurances. He chooses the super-rich, which makes his job much harder. The performances by Donald Sutherland, Stockard Channing, and Smith, himself are quite incredible. I began by absolutely hating these people. They are so smug and pretentious that they make one gag. And that's why their redemption due to this invader is so poignant. They grow to love this young man in their own ways, despite the fact that he appears dangerous (is he; I don't know). Of course, the six degrees is the theory that we are all related in some way if we go back six generations. The thing asked is, how can we then be so different. A real surprise.

    Six degrees of separation So there's this guy. He is just right. Then he goes to this couple's house and cooks them dinner and they all have a nice talk about art and books. Ian McClellan is there and he is trying to be South African but knows his accent is bad so doesn't say much. Then it is morning and the woman finds the nice guy bumming a stranger in the bedroom. Then everyone flips out and Donald Sutherland picks up all his trinkets. Then the next hour of the film is the couple telling a story. They tell the story to the kids who are SEETHING about them giving away the pink shirt which was for his new body. So then the newspaper says that the first guy, the nice guy, bummed some other guy and took his money after they danced in the rainbow room which is so unfair because he was just being nice as usual and likes a nice bumming. Then after a few more cocktail parties and stories the nice guy calls up "Weezer" the lady and says, you are my father do you want me to make you dinner again then they get stuck in traffic and Donald Sutherland cares about the nice guy when they see him get arrested but then he doesn't care anymore because really he is heartless and just wants to sell art to foreigners who don't even want to buy the art and just want to hear about the nice boy. Then Weezer is upset because she can't find the nice guy because he is a liar and is schizophrenic and he has hanged himself (probably) with the pink shirt in a prison but she is not family. Then she screams at Donald who tries to say "just let the lady buy the art " but she is having none of it and goes and looks at the flowers and then it ends. 3/10

    Of all the movies I've seen this one has to be the most contrived and pretentious. Like the fast paced and totally unbelievable dialogue for the 60s sitcom "'MASH" this movie is like that on steroids. In a nutshell, PEOPLE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT! The best way to describe is it's a combination of that annoying snappy, quick witted, (again) unrealistic dialogue of Neil Simon AND (try to visualize) Woody Allen lampooning people who are impressed by their own self importance. The characters are either obnoxious or self absorbed. I find all the characters to be incredibly self important. It's a horrible movie and felt the need to shower when it was over, yecccccch. While watching the film I continued to ask myself .."what is this"? Now the good news ,,, it's so bad that its a must see, looking at other reviews on this site I seem to be in the minority. Of. Ourselves it's others who are full of themselves too, Sorry guys I'm right and you're wrong . I grade this movie F? And the F stands for something else

    i voted this film very highly, an 8 to be exact. i might be the only one that thought Will Smith did a fine job within this movie. His character rehearsed his lines, therefore sounding rehearsed. So that robotic argument is virtually out the window, considering that's what his character was to be and sound like. Did anyone write about the possibility of Paul having any mental illness? It seems like people missed that the character of "Paul" needed mental help and that is one main reason louisa or oisa or whatever her name was felt for the kid. She was also impressed with his ability to learn so much and be able to change his way of speech and become so articulate in a matter of just 3 months. Personally, i cant think of a movie i've seen where i thought Donald Sutherland ever did a bad job either. I will agree with one thing though, the acting of the "kids" of each family was god awful.

    Nearly 20 years ago, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION should be regarded as Will Smith's breakthrough role into the mainstream Hollywood, the film is adapted by a renowned play by John Guare, directed by Aussie Fred Schepisi (from A CRY IN THE DARK 1988) and Channing reprises her role in the film edition which has guaranteed her sole Oscar nomination so far. Ever since the opening strain, there are echoes of high-class snootiness abounds which sets the keynote of the whole conversation-foiled phoniness among its quite antipathetic characters, namely the Kittredge couple, then when Will Smith's young intruder emerges, the tension never alleviates although it seems that from the surface the harmony is unfeigned at the beginning and Smith's identity as Sidney Poiter's son is ever questioned, simply since he knows their children's name and his eloquent run-down of his father's filmography, but presented by Smith's black color, the unspeakable sensitivity of racism is well-written and underscored. Added that the paraphrase of CATCHER IN THE RYE is more or less a stratagem of showboating, so when all the boast ends, the ugly truth manifests himself, a satirically comedic story continues with a welter of less spectacular vignettes. Written from a true story, John Guare's screenplay is less staggering than the integral cast, Channing is superb in her final revelation scene but elsewhere, her ability is curbed and sometimes even a bit OTT, Sutherland is more natural and his role is much worse in both moral and ethnic gauges, still another great performance for his undervalued career. Will Smith is the linchpin to influence his low-life leverage onto these upmarket snobs, his performance is not so astonishing on account of the greenness and rawness, but he is luminous in front of cameras, although the fake gay-kiss is a let-down, Hollywood's conservationism is just as dreadful and stinking as its unimaginative blockbuster monopoly. Funny thing is that in the film, Smith make a spiel on the importance of the supremacy of imagination, which plays a grave part in distinguishing human from other species, but now has being over-abused in the mundane media, but the whole theory is too feeble to be taken seriously, neither by upper class nor by those less self-concerned great amount of masses. So who is the real audience of the film? The filmmakers behind it had not a clue! PS: a young J.J. Abrams is in the film as well, as an actor, who could expect that?

    Though "Six Degrees of Separation" is not something I would call extraordinary, the story is no doubt among one of the most creative kind, while the powerful performances are no less important to present such a story. Will Smith plays the mysterious guy, somehow trying to spend a short period of time with people he does not know. Perhaps the purpose is questionable here, but it does not seem fraud is the reason. Somewhere along the line of a creative story, we are given powerful performances. Will Smith is incredible and so is Stockard Channing who plays a wife who comes into contact with the mysterious guy.

    "Six Degrees of Separation" is about a rich fifth avenue couple, the Kittredge's, who are conned by a young black man one night and spend the next few weeks finding out as much as they can about this boy. They go around telling the story to everyone they come across and find friends who went through the same experience days before. The movie is very slow moving, with many of the important scenes carried out through endless dialogue and very little else going on. Originally being a stage piece, the heavy dialogue is to be expected; however, the adaptation to screen leaves you wanting a little more. In spite of it's flaws, "Six Degrees of Separation" gives an interesting insight on how superficial lives can be and how we sometimes take what we have for granted.

    Occupy Wall Street might use this film for fund raisers. It presents the livIng hell of being rich and shallow, and it gives me the creeps much more today than it did when I first saw it. There are some interesting references that date it. For example, the Rainbow Room ejects Will Smith for dancing the tango with a male friend, an act which no such NYC establishment would likely do today. Along those lines, Michael Anthony Hall hands in a very courageous performance as the gay kid who falls for Will and sets his antics in motion. I remember how sensational that kiss between them seemed at the time. Will's character has universal appeal. He is the ultimate con man and hustler, but he is so successful because he is charming. Maybe if rich people today would allow themselves to fall for what is charming, they would delight in helping the struggling people of the world today rather than worrying so much about selling their Kandinskys. Stockard Channing turns in one of the great film performances of the century, showing how a One-Percenter can experience a spiritual epiphany. In this sense, Guare is a modern Dickens, deserving of all the accolades he received for this script and screen play, which reminds us that we are six degrees of separation not only from Kevin Bacon but of every kid in Zuccotti Park or Tahrir Square. "How much of your life can you account for?" With tears in her eyes, Stockard Channing asks Donald Sutherland this question with the same direness in her voice that Jesus must have had when he addressed the rich guys in the Holy Land.

    This is a disgusting movie with so many phony hypocrites in it. If you treat it as a social satire but in reality, you just couldn't find so many disgusting human beings in one city. If New York was targeted as the hypocrites center of the universe as the movie itself described, then you must keep away from this cesspool of phonies. I just couldn't hang on to watch this movie, because almost in any moment I might puke. The characters were so disgusting, so exaggerated, so dramatically ballooned into so self-important pretentious. If rich people could become so disgustingly inhuman, then I'd rather stay in poverty. At first, I thought this movie was with a touch of Woody Allen's movies, but then I've found out this was a totally different beast, a twisted and mutant interpretation of the rich and the rich wannabes. The dialog was just so over-the-top pretentious and obnoxious that hurt every nerve of my hearing. Could be people become so pathetic that they would have to sit down or stand around to listen to the crap of the couple and the phony young guy played by Will Smith? Who would be so stupid to suffer such torment crap out by these people? This movie is a complete ridiculous joke!

    I have gained new respect for Will Smith, as an actor, after this movie. Not that I didn't have much before As much as I adore his personality among other talents, I really didn't expect him to pull off this role with such ease. Considering the difficulty. Paul is one of our main characters, who suddenly appears at a rich couple's home (who are art dealers).

    I have gained new respect for Will Smith, as an actor, after this movie. Not that I didn't have much before As much as I adore his personality among other talents, I really didn't expect him to pull off this role with such ease. Considering the difficulty. Paul is one of our main characters, who suddenly appears at a rich couple's home (who are art dealers). He's stabbed after a mugging and dressed in fine clothing, he claims to be the couple's son and daughter's friend from Harvard. After going through detailed knowledge about their children, he woos the dealers and their business guest with his charm, knowledge, and deep insight into the world (at this point Will Smith delivers some great monologue). Later the plot ensues and you find out the Paul is not who he claims to be and the mystery unravels through dinner conversation and anecdote. This movie is based on a play, and through the movie you can clearly see the strength of the dialog carries the story as well as the actors who deliver them. I love the movie for its depth in simplicity. How it uses conversation to draw you in rather than the typical action. It uses conversation to reveal the action and mystery that you so desire. My favorite character in the movie is Ouisa Kittredge played by Stockard Channing. She's the main character who is closest to Paul and grows after this experience with Paul. Do not be mistaken, this movie is NOT about a bunch of rich snobs coming to their way after being exposed to a black boy with promise and potential but no means. No, there is perhaps 5% of that in this movie, and there is no strong pretenses with this film. It goes deeper than just a sympathetic rich white lady, much deeper indeed. This film may not be for everyone, but it is for those who love good dialogs and monologues and for those who love plays ( or at least don't mind them). (the kid's were stupid and pointless one dimensional characters, but that's my only qualm).

    I guess we can see the genius of Will Smith right from the start. This is a film about a chameleon who is able to create for himself identities suited to an intriguing game he is playing. He really wants to be loved, but has become so deeply entrenched in his charade that he soon isn't sure what he wants. He is a master of subterfuge with a smile and a wink. He claims to be the son of someone who is relatively reclusive and unapproachable. This gives him the opportunity to invade people's lives; but for what? It's his "victims" that grow because of him. He is searching for a family but needs so many assurances. He chooses the super-rich, which makes his job much harder. The performances by Donald Sutherland, Stockard Channing, and Smith, himself are quite incredible. I began by absolutely hating these people. They are so smug and pretentious that they make one gag. And that's why their redemption due to this invader is so poignant. They grow to love this young man in their own ways, despite the fact that he appears dangerous (is he; I don't know). Of course, the six degrees is the theory that we are all related in some way if we go back six generations. The thing asked is, how can we then be so different. A real surprise.

    Six degrees of separation So there's this guy. He is just right. Then he goes to this couple's house and cooks them dinner and they all have a nice talk about art and books. Ian McClellan is there and he is trying to be South African but knows his accent is bad so doesn't say much. Then it is morning and the woman finds the nice guy bumming a stranger in the bedroom. Then everyone flips out and Donald Sutherland picks up all his trinkets. Then the next hour of the film is the couple telling a story. They tell the story to the kids who are SEETHING about them giving away the pink shirt which was for his new body. So then the newspaper says that the first guy, the nice guy, bummed some other guy and took his money after they danced in the rainbow room which is so unfair because he was just being nice as usual and likes a nice bumming. Then after a few more cocktail parties and stories the nice guy calls up "Weezer" the lady and says, you are my father do you want me to make you dinner again then they get stuck in traffic and Donald Sutherland cares about the nice guy when they see him get arrested but then he doesn't care anymore because really he is heartless and just wants to sell art to foreigners who don't even want to buy the art and just want to hear about the nice boy. Then Weezer is upset because she can't find the nice guy because he is a liar and is schizophrenic and he has hanged himself (probably) with the pink shirt in a prison but she is not family. Then she screams at Donald who tries to say "just let the lady buy the art " but she is having none of it and goes and looks at the flowers and then it ends. 3/10

    Of all the movies I've seen this one has to be the most contrived and pretentious. Like the fast paced and totally unbelievable dialogue for the 60s sitcom "'MASH" this movie is like that on steroids. In a nutshell, PEOPLE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT! The best way to describe is it's a combination of that annoying snappy, quick witted, (again) unrealistic dialogue of Neil Simon AND (try to visualize) Woody Allen lampooning people who are impressed by their own self importance. The characters are either obnoxious or self absorbed. I find all the characters to be incredibly self important. It's a horrible movie and felt the need to shower when it was over, yecccccch. While watching the film I continued to ask myself .."what is this"? Now the good news ,,, it's so bad that its a must see, looking at other reviews on this site I seem to be in the minority. Of. Ourselves it's others who are full of themselves too, Sorry guys I'm right and you're wrong . I grade this movie F? And the F stands for something else

    i voted this film very highly, an 8 to be exact. i might be the only one that thought Will Smith did a fine job within this movie. His character rehearsed his lines, therefore sounding rehearsed. So that robotic argument is virtually out the window, considering that's what his character was to be and sound like. Did anyone write about the possibility of Paul having any mental illness? It seems like people missed that the character of "Paul" needed mental help and that is one main reason louisa or oisa or whatever her name was felt for the kid. She was also impressed with his ability to learn so much and be able to change his way of speech and become so articulate in a matter of just 3 months. Personally, i cant think of a movie i've seen where i thought Donald Sutherland ever did a bad job either. I will agree with one thing though, the acting of the "kids" of each family was god awful.

    Nearly 20 years ago, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION should be regarded as Will Smith's breakthrough role into the mainstream Hollywood, the film is adapted by a renowned play by John Guare, directed by Aussie Fred Schepisi (from A CRY IN THE DARK 1988) and Channing reprises her role in the film edition which has guaranteed her sole Oscar nomination so far. Ever since the opening strain, there are echoes of high-class snootiness abounds which sets the keynote of the whole conversation-foiled phoniness among its quite antipathetic characters, namely the Kittredge couple, then when Will Smith's young intruder emerges, the tension never alleviates although it seems that from the surface the harmony is unfeigned at the beginning and Smith's identity as Sidney Poiter's son is ever questioned, simply since he knows their children's name and his eloquent run-down of his father's filmography, but presented by Smith's black color, the unspeakable sensitivity of racism is well-written and underscored. Added that the paraphrase of CATCHER IN THE RYE is more or less a stratagem of showboating, so when all the boast ends, the ugly truth manifests himself, a satirically comedic story continues with a welter of less spectacular vignettes. Written from a true story, John Guare's screenplay is less staggering than the integral cast, Channing is superb in her final revelation scene but elsewhere, her ability is curbed and sometimes even a bit OTT, Sutherland is more natural and his role is much worse in both moral and ethnic gauges, still another great performance for his undervalued career. Will Smith is the linchpin to influence his low-life leverage onto these upmarket snobs, his performance is not so astonishing on account of the greenness and rawness, but he is luminous in front of cameras, although the fake gay-kiss is a let-down, Hollywood's conservationism is just as dreadful and stinking as its unimaginative blockbuster monopoly. Funny thing is that in the film, Smith make a spiel on the importance of the supremacy of imagination, which plays a grave part in distinguishing human from other species, but now has being over-abused in the mundane media, but the whole theory is too feeble to be taken seriously, neither by upper class nor by those less self-concerned great amount of masses. So who is the real audience of the film? The filmmakers behind it had not a clue! PS: a young J.J. Abrams is in the film as well, as an actor, who could expect that?

    Though "Six Degrees of Separation" is not something I would call extraordinary, the story is no doubt among one of the most creative kind, while the powerful performances are no less important to present such a story. Will Smith plays the mysterious guy, somehow trying to spend a short period of time with people he does not know. Perhaps the purpose is questionable here, but it does not seem fraud is the reason. Somewhere along the line of a creative story, we are given powerful performances. Will Smith is incredible and so is Stockard Channing who plays a wife who comes into contact with the mysterious guy.

    "Six Degrees of Separation" is about a rich fifth avenue couple, the Kittredge's, who are conned by a young black man one night and spend the next few weeks finding out as much as they can about this boy. They go around telling the story to everyone they come across and find friends who went through the same experience days before. The movie is very slow moving, with many of the important scenes carried out through endless dialogue and very little else going on. Originally being a stage piece, the heavy dialogue is to be expected; however, the adaptation to screen leaves you wanting a little more. In spite of it's flaws, "Six Degrees of Separation" gives an interesting insight on how superficial lives can be and how we sometimes take what we have for granted.

    Occupy Wall Street might use this film for fund raisers. It presents the livIng hell of being rich and shallow, and it gives me the creeps much more today than it did when I first saw it. There are some interesting references that date it. For example, the Rainbow Room ejects Will Smith for dancing the tango with a male friend, an act which no such NYC establishment would likely do today. Along those lines, Michael Anthony Hall hands in a very courageous performance as the gay kid who falls for Will and sets his antics in motion. I remember how sensational that kiss between them seemed at the time. Will's character has universal appeal. He is the ultimate con man and hustler, but he is so successful because he is charming. Maybe if rich people today would allow themselves to fall for what is charming, they would delight in helping the struggling people of the world today rather than worrying so much about selling their Kandinskys. Stockard Channing turns in one of the great film performances of the century, showing how a One-Percenter can experience a spiritual epiphany. In this sense, Guare is a modern Dickens, deserving of all the accolades he received for this script and screen play, which reminds us that we are six degrees of separation not only from Kevin Bacon but of every kid in Zuccotti Park or Tahrir Square. "How much of your life can you account for?" With tears in her eyes, Stockard Channing asks Donald Sutherland this question with the same direness in her voice that Jesus must have had when he addressed the rich guys in the Holy Land.

    This is a disgusting movie with so many phony hypocrites in it. If you treat it as a social satire but in reality, you just couldn't find so many disgusting human beings in one city. If New York was targeted as the hypocrites center of the universe as the movie itself described, then you must keep away from this cesspool of phonies. I just couldn't hang on to watch this movie, because almost in any moment I might puke. The characters were so disgusting, so exaggerated, so dramatically ballooned into so self-important pretentious. If rich people could become so disgustingly inhuman, then I'd rather stay in poverty. At first, I thought this movie was with a touch of Woody Allen's movies, but then I've found out this was a totally different beast, a twisted and mutant interpretation of the rich and the rich wannabes. The dialog was just so over-the-top pretentious and obnoxious that hurt every nerve of my hearing. Could be people become so pathetic that they would have to sit down or stand around to listen to the crap of the couple and the phony young guy played by Will Smith? Who would be so stupid to suffer such torment crap out by these people? This movie is a complete ridiculous joke!

Who would be so stupid to suffer such torment crap out by these people? This movie is a complete ridiculous joke!

    I have gained new respect for Will Smith, as an actor, after this movie. Not that I didn't have much before As much as I adore his personality among other talents, I really didn't expect him to pull off this role with such ease. Considering the difficulty. Paul is one of our main characters, who suddenly appears at a rich couple's home (who are art dealers). He's stabbed after a mugging and dressed in fine clothing, he claims to be the couple's son and daughter's friend from Harvard. After going through detailed knowledge about their children, he woos the dealers and their business guest with his charm, knowledge, and deep insight into the world (at this point Will Smith delivers some great monologue). Later the plot ensues and you find out the Paul is not who he claims to be and the mystery unravels through dinner conversation and anecdote. This movie is based on a play, and through the movie you can clearly see the strength of the dialog carries the story as well as the actors who deliver them. I love the movie for its depth in simplicity. How it uses conversation to draw you in rather than the typical action. It uses conversation to reveal the action and mystery that you so desire. My favorite character in the movie is Ouisa Kittredge played by Stockard Channing. She's the main character who is closest to Paul and grows after this experience with Paul. Do not be mistaken, this movie is NOT about a bunch of rich snobs coming to their way after being exposed to a black boy with promise and potential but no means. No, there is perhaps 5% of that in this movie, and there is no strong pretenses with this film. It goes deeper than just a sympathetic rich white lady, much deeper indeed. This film may not be for everyone, but it is for those who love good dialogs and monologues and for those who love plays ( or at least don't mind them). (the kid's were stupid and pointless one dimensional characters, but that's my only qualm).

    I guess we can see the genius of Will Smith right from the start. This is a film about a chameleon who is able to create for himself identities suited to an intriguing game he is playing. He really wants to be loved, but has become so deeply entrenched in his charade that he soon isn't sure what he wants. He is a master of subterfuge with a smile and a wink. He claims to be the son of someone who is relatively reclusive and unapproachable. This gives him the opportunity to invade people's lives; but for what? It's his "victims" that grow because of him. He is searching for a family but needs so many assurances. He chooses the super-rich, which makes his job much harder. The performances by Donald Sutherland, Stockard Channing, and Smith, himself are quite incredible. I began by absolutely hating these people. They are so smug and pretentious that they make one gag. And that's why their redemption due to this invader is so poignant. They grow to love this young man in their own ways, despite the fact that he appears dangerous (is he; I don't know). Of course, the six degrees is the theory that we are all related in some way if we go back six generations. The thing asked is, how can we then be so different. A real surprise.

    Six degrees of separation So there's this guy. He is just right. Then he goes to this couple's house and cooks them dinner and they all have a nice talk about art and books. Ian McClellan is there and he is trying to be South African but knows his accent is bad so doesn't say much. Then it is morning and the woman finds the nice guy bumming a stranger in the bedroom. Then everyone flips out and Donald Sutherland picks up all his trinkets. Then the next hour of the film is the couple telling a story. They tell the story to the kids who are SEETHING about them giving away the pink shirt which was for his new body. So then the newspaper says that the first guy, the nice guy, bummed some other guy and took his money after they danced in the rainbow room which is so unfair because he was just being nice as usual and likes a nice bumming. Then after a few more cocktail parties and stories the nice guy calls up "Weezer" the lady and says, you are my father do you want me to make you dinner again then they get stuck in traffic and Donald Sutherland cares about the nice guy when they see him get arrested but then he doesn't care anymore because really he is heartless and just wants to sell art to foreigners who don't even want to buy the art and just want to hear about the nice boy. Then Weezer is upset because she can't find the nice guy because he is a liar and is schizophrenic and he has hanged himself (probably) with the pink shirt in a prison but she is not family. Then she screams at Donald who tries to say "just let the lady buy the art " but she is having none of it and goes and looks at the flowers and then it ends. 3/10

    Of all the movies I've seen this one has to be the most contrived and pretentious. Like the fast paced and totally unbelievable dialogue for the 60s sitcom "'MASH" this movie is like that on steroids. In a nutshell, PEOPLE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT! The best way to describe is it's a combination of that annoying snappy, quick witted, (again) unrealistic dialogue of Neil Simon AND (try to visualize) Woody Allen lampooning people who are impressed by their own self importance. The characters are either obnoxious or self absorbed. I find all the characters to be incredibly self important. It's a horrible movie and felt the need to shower when it was over, yecccccch. While watching the film I continued to ask myself .."what is this"? Now the good news ,,, it's so bad that its a must see, looking at other reviews on this site I seem to be in the minority. Of. Ourselves it's others who are full of themselves too, Sorry guys I'm right and you're wrong . I grade this movie F? And the F stands for something else

    i voted this film very highly, an 8 to be exact. i might be the only one that thought Will Smith did a fine job within this movie. His character rehearsed his lines, therefore sounding rehearsed. So that robotic argument is virtually out the window, considering that's what his character was to be and sound like. Did anyone write about the possibility of Paul having any mental illness? It seems like people missed that the character of "Paul" needed mental help and that is one main reason louisa or oisa or whatever her name was felt for the kid. She was also impressed with his ability to learn so much and be able to change his way of speech and become so articulate in a matter of just 3 months. Personally, i cant think of a movie i've seen where i thought Donald Sutherland ever did a bad job either. I will agree with one thing though, the acting of the "kids" of each family was god awful.

    Nearly 20 years ago, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION should be regarded as Will Smith's breakthrough role into the mainstream Hollywood, the film is adapted by a renowned play by John Guare, directed by Aussie Fred Schepisi (from A CRY IN THE DARK 1988) and Channing reprises her role in the film edition which has guaranteed her sole Oscar nomination so far. Ever since the opening strain, there are echoes of high-class snootiness abounds which sets the keynote of the whole conversation-foiled phoniness among its quite antipathetic characters, namely the Kittredge couple, then when Will Smith's young intruder emerges, the tension never alleviates although it seems that from the surface the harmony is unfeigned at the beginning and Smith's identity as Sidney Poiter's son is ever questioned, simply since he knows their children's name and his eloquent run-down of his father's filmography, but presented by Smith's black color, the unspeakable sensitivity of racism is well-written and underscored. Added that the paraphrase of CATCHER IN THE RYE is more or less a stratagem of showboating, so when all the boast ends, the ugly truth manifests himself, a satirically comedic story continues with a welter of less spectacular vignettes. Written from a true story, John Guare's screenplay is less staggering than the integral cast, Channing is superb in her final revelation scene but elsewhere, her ability is curbed and sometimes even a bit OTT, Sutherland is more natural and his role is much worse in both moral and ethnic gauges, still another great performance for his undervalued career. Will Smith is the linchpin to influence his low-life leverage onto these upmarket snobs, his performance is not so astonishing on account of the greenness and rawness, but he is luminous in front of cameras, although the fake gay-kiss is a let-down, Hollywood's conservationism is just as dreadful and stinking as its unimaginative blockbuster monopoly. Funny thing is that in the film, Smith make a spiel on the importance of the supremacy of imagination, which plays a grave part in distinguishing human from other species, but now has being over-abused in the mundane media, but the whole theory is too feeble to be taken seriously, neither by upper class nor by those less self-concerned great amount of masses. So who is the real audience of the film? The filmmakers behind it had not a clue! PS: a young J.J. Abrams is in the film as well, as an actor, who could expect that?

    Though "Six Degrees of Separation" is not something I would call extraordinary, the story is no doubt among one of the most creative kind, while the powerful performances are no less important to present such a story. Will Smith plays the mysterious guy, somehow trying to spend a short period of time with people he does not know. Perhaps the purpose is questionable here, but it does not seem fraud is the reason. Somewhere along the line of a creative story, we are given powerful performances. Will Smith is incredible and so is Stockard Channing who plays a wife who comes into contact with the mysterious guy.

    "Six Degrees of Separation" is about a rich fifth avenue couple, the Kittredge's, who are conned by a young black man one night and spend the next few weeks finding out as much as they can about this boy. They go around telling the story to everyone they come across and find friends who went through the same experience days before. The movie is very slow moving, with many of the important scenes carried out through endless dialogue and very little else going on. Originally being a stage piece, the heavy dialogue is to be expected; however, the adaptation to screen leaves you wanting a little more. In spite of it's flaws, "Six Degrees of Separation" gives an interesting insight on how superficial lives can be and how we sometimes take what we have for granted.

    Occupy Wall Street might use this film for fund raisers. It presents the livIng hell of being rich and shallow, and it gives me the creeps much more today than it did when I first saw it. There are some interesting references that date it. For example, the Rainbow Room ejects Will Smith for dancing the tango with a male friend, an act which no such NYC establishment would likely do today. Along those lines, Michael Anthony Hall hands in a very courageous performance as the gay kid who falls for Will and sets his antics in motion. I remember how sensational that kiss between them seemed at the time. Will's character has universal appeal. He is the ultimate con man and hustler, but he is so successful because he is charming. Maybe if rich people today would allow themselves to fall for what is charming, they would delight in helping the struggling people of the world today rather than worrying so much about selling their Kandinskys. Stockard Channing turns in one of the great film performances of the century, showing how a One-Percenter can experience a spiritual epiphany. In this sense, Guare is a modern Dickens, deserving of all the accolades he received for this script and screen play, which reminds us that we are six degrees of separation not only from Kevin Bacon but of every kid in Zuccotti Park or Tahrir Square. "How much of your life can you account for?" With tears in her eyes, Stockard Channing asks Donald Sutherland this question with the same direness in her voice that Jesus must have had when he addressed the rich guys in the Holy Land.

    This is a disgusting movie with so many phony hypocrites in it. If you treat it as a social satire but in reality, you just couldn't find so many disgusting human beings in one city. If New York was targeted as the hypocrites center of the universe as the movie itself described, then you must keep away from this cesspool of phonies. I just couldn't hang on to watch this movie, because almost in any moment I might puke. The characters were so disgusting, so exaggerated, so dramatically ballooned into so self-important pretentious. If rich people could become so disgustingly inhuman, then I'd rather stay in poverty. At first, I thought this movie was with a touch of Woody Allen's movies, but then I've found out this was a totally different beast, a twisted and mutant interpretation of the rich and the rich wannabes. The dialog was just so over-the-top pretentious and obnoxious that hurt every nerve of my hearing. Could be people become so pathetic that they would have to sit down or stand around to listen to the crap of the couple and the phony young guy played by Will Smith? Who would be so stupid to suffer such torment crap out by these people? This movie is a complete ridiculous joke!

The characters were so disgusting, so exaggerated, so dramatically ballooned into so self-important pretentious. If rich people could become so disgustingly inhuman, then I'd rather stay in poverty. At first, I thought this movie was with a touch of Woody Allen's movies, but then I've found out this was a totally different beast, a twisted and mutant interpretation of the rich and the rich wannabes. The dialog was just so over-the-top pretentious and obnoxious that hurt every nerve of my hearing. Could be people become so pathetic that they would have to sit down or stand around to listen to the crap of the couple and the phony young guy played by Will Smith? Who would be so stupid to suffer such torment crap out by these people? This movie is a complete ridiculous joke!

    I have gained new respect for Will Smith, as an actor, after this movie. Not that I didn't have much before As much as I adore his personality among other talents, I really didn't expect him to pull off this role with such ease. Considering the difficulty. Paul is one of our main characters, who suddenly appears at a rich couple's home (who are art dealers). He's stabbed after a mugging and dressed in fine clothing, he claims to be the couple's son and daughter's friend from Harvard. After going through detailed knowledge about their children, he woos the dealers and their business guest with his charm, knowledge, and deep insight into the world (at this point Will Smith delivers some great monologue). Later the plot ensues and you find out the Paul is not who he claims to be and the mystery unravels through dinner conversation and anecdote. This movie is based on a play, and through the movie you can clearly see the strength of the dialog carries the story as well as the actors who deliver them. I love the movie for its depth in simplicity. How it uses conversation to draw you in rather than the typical action. It uses conversation to reveal the action and mystery that you so desire. My favorite character in the movie is Ouisa Kittredge played by Stockard Channing. She's the main character who is closest to Paul and grows after this experience with Paul. Do not be mistaken, this movie is NOT about a bunch of rich snobs coming to their way after being exposed to a black boy with promise and potential but no means. No, there is perhaps 5% of that in this movie, and there is no strong pretenses with this film. It goes deeper than just a sympathetic rich white lady, much deeper indeed. This film may not be for everyone, but it is for those who love good dialogs and monologues and for those who love plays ( or at least don't mind them). (the kid's were stupid and pointless one dimensional characters, but that's my only qualm).

    I guess we can see the genius of Will Smith right from the start. This is a film about a chameleon who is able to create for himself identities suited to an intriguing game he is playing. He really wants to be loved, but has become so deeply entrenched in his charade that he soon isn't sure what he wants. He is a master of subterfuge with a smile and a wink. He claims to be the son of someone who is relatively reclusive and unapproachable. This gives him the opportunity to invade people's lives; but for what? It's his "victims" that grow because of him. He is searching for a family but needs so many assurances. He chooses the super-rich, which makes his job much harder. The performances by Donald Sutherland, Stockard Channing, and Smith, himself are quite incredible. I began by absolutely hating these people. They are so smug and pretentious that they make one gag. And that's why their redemption due to this invader is so poignant. They grow to love this young man in their own ways, despite the fact that he appears dangerous (is he; I don't know). Of course, the six degrees is the theory that we are all related in some way if we go back six generations. The thing asked is, how can we then be so different. A real surprise.

    Six degrees of separation So there's this guy. He is just right. Then he goes to this couple's house and cooks them dinner and they all have a nice talk about art and books. Ian McClellan is there and he is trying to be South African but knows his accent is bad so doesn't say much. Then it is morning and the woman finds the nice guy bumming a stranger in the bedroom. Then everyone flips out and Donald Sutherland picks up all his trinkets. Then the next hour of the film is the couple telling a story. They tell the story to the kids who are SEETHING about them giving away the pink shirt which was for his new body. So then the newspaper says that the first guy, the nice guy, bummed some other guy and took his money after they danced in the rainbow room which is so unfair because he was just being nice as usual and likes a nice bumming. Then after a few more cocktail parties and stories the nice guy calls up "Weezer" the lady and says, you are my father do you want me to make you dinner again then they get stuck in traffic and Donald Sutherland cares about the nice guy when they see him get arrested but then he doesn't care anymore because really he is heartless and just wants to sell art to foreigners who don't even want to buy the art and just want to hear about the nice boy. Then Weezer is upset because she can't find the nice guy because he is a liar and is schizophrenic and he has hanged himself (probably) with the pink shirt in a prison but she is not family. Then she screams at Donald who tries to say "just let the lady buy the art " but she is having none of it and goes and looks at the flowers and then it ends. 3/10

    Of all the movies I've seen this one has to be the most contrived and pretentious. Like the fast paced and totally unbelievable dialogue for the 60s sitcom "'MASH" this movie is like that on steroids. In a nutshell, PEOPLE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT! The best way to describe is it's a combination of that annoying snappy, quick witted, (again) unrealistic dialogue of Neil Simon AND (try to visualize) Woody Allen lampooning people who are impressed by their own self importance. The characters are either obnoxious or self absorbed. I find all the characters to be incredibly self important. It's a horrible movie and felt the need to shower when it was over, yecccccch. While watching the film I continued to ask myself .."what is this"? Now the good news ,,, it's so bad that its a must see, looking at other reviews on this site I seem to be in the minority. Of. Ourselves it's others who are full of themselves too, Sorry guys I'm right and you're wrong . I grade this movie F? And the F stands for something else

    i voted this film very highly, an 8 to be exact. i might be the only one that thought Will Smith did a fine job within this movie. His character rehearsed his lines, therefore sounding rehearsed. So that robotic argument is virtually out the window, considering that's what his character was to be and sound like. Did anyone write about the possibility of Paul having any mental illness? It seems like people missed that the character of "Paul" needed mental help and that is one main reason louisa or oisa or whatever her name was felt for the kid. She was also impressed with his ability to learn so much and be able to change his way of speech and become so articulate in a matter of just 3 months. Personally, i cant think of a movie i've seen where i thought Donald Sutherland ever did a bad job either. I will agree with one thing though, the acting of the "kids" of each family was god awful.

    Nearly 20 years ago, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION should be regarded as Will Smith's breakthrough role into the mainstream Hollywood, the film is adapted by a renowned play by John Guare, directed by Aussie Fred Schepisi (from A CRY IN THE DARK 1988) and Channing reprises her role in the film edition which has guaranteed her sole Oscar nomination so far. Ever since the opening strain, there are echoes of high-class snootiness abounds which sets the keynote of the whole conversation-foiled phoniness among its quite antipathetic characters, namely the Kittredge couple, then when Will Smith's young intruder emerges, the tension never alleviates although it seems that from the surface the harmony is unfeigned at the beginning and Smith's identity as Sidney Poiter's son is ever questioned, simply since he knows their children's name and his eloquent run-down of his father's filmography, but presented by Smith's black color, the unspeakable sensitivity of racism is well-written and underscored. Added that the paraphrase of CATCHER IN THE RYE is more or less a stratagem of showboating, so when all the boast ends, the ugly truth manifests himself, a satirically comedic story continues with a welter of less spectacular vignettes. Written from a true story, John Guare's screenplay is less staggering than the integral cast, Channing is superb in her final revelation scene but elsewhere, her ability is curbed and sometimes even a bit OTT, Sutherland is more natural and his role is much worse in both moral and ethnic gauges, still another great performance for his undervalued career. Will Smith is the linchpin to influence his low-life leverage onto these upmarket snobs, his performance is not so astonishing on account of the greenness and rawness, but he is luminous in front of cameras, although the fake gay-kiss is a let-down, Hollywood's conservationism is just as dreadful and stinking as its unimaginative blockbuster monopoly. Funny thing is that in the film, Smith make a spiel on the importance of the supremacy of imagination, which plays a grave part in distinguishing human from other species, but now has being over-abused in the mundane media, but the whole theory is too feeble to be taken seriously, neither by upper class nor by those less self-concerned great amount of masses. So who is the real audience of the film? The filmmakers behind it had not a clue! PS: a young J.J. Abrams is in the film as well, as an actor, who could expect that?

    Though "Six Degrees of Separation" is not something I would call extraordinary, the story is no doubt among one of the most creative kind, while the powerful performances are no less important to present such a story. Will Smith plays the mysterious guy, somehow trying to spend a short period of time with people he does not know. Perhaps the purpose is questionable here, but it does not seem fraud is the reason. Somewhere along the line of a creative story, we are given powerful performances. Will Smith is incredible and so is Stockard Channing who plays a wife who comes into contact with the mysterious guy.

    "Six Degrees of Separation" is about a rich fifth avenue couple, the Kittredge's, who are conned by a young black man one night and spend the next few weeks finding out as much as they can about this boy. They go around telling the story to everyone they come across and find friends who went through the same experience days before. The movie is very slow moving, with many of the important scenes carried out through endless dialogue and very little else going on. Originally being a stage piece, the heavy dialogue is to be expected; however, the adaptation to screen leaves you wanting a little more. In spite of it's flaws, "Six Degrees of Separation" gives an interesting insight on how superficial lives can be and how we sometimes take what we have for granted.

    Occupy Wall Street might use this film for fund raisers. It presents the livIng hell of being rich and shallow, and it gives me the creeps much more today than it did when I first saw it. There are some interesting references that date it. For example, the Rainbow Room ejects Will Smith for dancing the tango with a male friend, an act which no such NYC establishment would likely do today. Along those lines, Michael Anthony Hall hands in a very courageous performance as the gay kid who falls for Will and sets his antics in motion. I remember how sensational that kiss between them seemed at the time. Will's character has universal appeal. He is the ultimate con man and hustler, but he is so successful because he is charming. Maybe if rich people today would allow themselves to fall for what is charming, they would delight in helping the struggling people of the world today rather than worrying so much about selling their Kandinskys. Stockard Channing turns in one of the great film performances of the century, showing how a One-Percenter can experience a spiritual epiphany. In this sense, Guare is a modern Dickens, deserving of all the accolades he received for this script and screen play, which reminds us that we are six degrees of separation not only from Kevin Bacon but of every kid in Zuccotti Park or Tahrir Square. "How much of your life can you account for?" With tears in her eyes, Stockard Channing asks Donald Sutherland this question with the same direness in her voice that Jesus must have had when he addressed the rich guys in the Holy Land.

    This is a disgusting movie with so many phony hypocrites in it. If you treat it as a social satire but in reality, you just couldn't find so many disgusting human beings in one city. If New York was targeted as the hypocrites center of the universe as the movie itself described, then you must keep away from this cesspool of phonies. I just couldn't hang on to watch this movie, because almost in any moment I might puke. The characters were so disgusting, so exaggerated, so dramatically ballooned into so self-important pretentious. If rich people could become so disgustingly inhuman, then I'd rather stay in poverty.

    This is a disgusting movie with so many phony hypocrites in it. If you treat it as a social satire but in reality, you just couldn't find so many disgusting human beings in one city. If New York was targeted as the hypocrites center of the universe as the movie itself described, then you must keep away from this cesspool of phonies. I just couldn't hang on to watch this movie, because almost in any moment I might puke. The characters were so disgusting, so exaggerated, so dramatically ballooned into so self-important pretentious. If rich people could become so disgustingly inhuman, then I'd rather stay in poverty. At first, I thought this movie was with a touch of Woody Allen's movies, but then I've found out this was a totally different beast, a twisted and mutant interpretation of the rich and the rich wannabes. The dialog was just so over-the-top pretentious and obnoxious that hurt every nerve of my hearing. Could be people become so pathetic that they would have to sit down or stand around to listen to the crap of the couple and the phony young guy played by Will Smith? Who would be so stupid to suffer such torment crap out by these people? This movie is a complete ridiculous joke!

    I have gained new respect for Will Smith, as an actor, after this movie. Not that I didn't have much before As much as I adore his personality among other talents, I really didn't expect him to pull off this role with such ease. Considering the difficulty. Paul is one of our main characters, who suddenly appears at a rich couple's home (who are art dealers). He's stabbed after a mugging and dressed in fine clothing, he claims to be the couple's son and daughter's friend from Harvard. After going through detailed knowledge about their children, he woos the dealers and their business guest with his charm, knowledge, and deep insight into the world (at this point Will Smith delivers some great monologue). Later the plot ensues and you find out the Paul is not who he claims to be and the mystery unravels through dinner conversation and anecdote. This movie is based on a play, and through the movie you can clearly see the strength of the dialog carries the story as well as the actors who deliver them. I love the movie for its depth in simplicity. How it uses conversation to draw you in rather than the typical action. It uses conversation to reveal the action and mystery that you so desire. My favorite character in the movie is Ouisa Kittredge played by Stockard Channing. She's the main character who is closest to Paul and grows after this experience with Paul. Do not be mistaken, this movie is NOT about a bunch of rich snobs coming to their way after being exposed to a black boy with promise and potential but no means. No, there is perhaps 5% of that in this movie, and there is no strong pretenses with this film. It goes deeper than just a sympathetic rich white lady, much deeper indeed. This film may not be for everyone, but it is for those who love good dialogs and monologues and for those who love plays ( or at least don't mind them). (the kid's were stupid and pointless one dimensional characters, but that's my only qualm).

    I guess we can see the genius of Will Smith right from the start. This is a film about a chameleon who is able to create for himself identities suited to an intriguing game he is playing. He really wants to be loved, but has become so deeply entrenched in his charade that he soon isn't sure what he wants. He is a master of subterfuge with a smile and a wink. He claims to be the son of someone who is relatively reclusive and unapproachable. This gives him the opportunity to invade people's lives; but for what? It's his "victims" that grow because of him. He is searching for a family but needs so many assurances. He chooses the super-rich, which makes his job much harder. The performances by Donald Sutherland, Stockard Channing, and Smith, himself are quite incredible. I began by absolutely hating these people. They are so smug and pretentious that they make one gag. And that's why their redemption due to this invader is so poignant. They grow to love this young man in their own ways, despite the fact that he appears dangerous (is he; I don't know). Of course, the six degrees is the theory that we are all related in some way if we go back six generations. The thing asked is, how can we then be so different. A real surprise.
