 <sinopse>
  Shakespeare's comedy of gender confusion, in which a girl disguises herself as a man to be near the count she adores, only to be pursued by the woman he loves.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Brother and sister Viola and Sebastian, who are not only very close but look a great deal alike, are in a shipwreck, and both think the other dead. When she lands in a foreign country, Viola dresses as her brother and adopts the name Cesario, becoming a trusted friend and confidante to the Count Orsino. Orsino is madly in love with the lady Olivia, who is in mourning due to her brother's recent death, which she uses as an excuse to avoid seeing the count, whom she does not love. He sends Cesario to do his wooing, and Olivia falls in love with the disguised maiden. Things get more complicated in this bittersweet Shakespeare comedy when a moronic nobleman, Sir Andrew Aguecheek, and a self-important servant, Malvolio, get caught up in the schemes of Olivia's cousin, the obese, alcoholic Sir Toby, who leads each to believe Olivia loves him. As well, Sebastian surfaces in the area, and of course there is Feste, the wise fool, around to keep everything in perspective and to marvel, like we ...

    Viola and her twin brother Sebastian are divided and both believe the other to be dead. On unfriendly land, she has to become a servant to Orsini, whom she falls for. To work for him, she has to dress up like a boy(thus commenting on the differences between the genders, and how we relate to the same or the opposite sex). And he wants to be with Olivia, who can't imagine being with her(who she thinks is male), when he sends her to court her. Confused? Then I won't go into the subplots. There is enough unrequited love to go around, and that situation is described well. This is kept in Shakespeare's language(with all it's delicious constructions, several of which have become common sayings today), and whilst I have not read the original play and thus cannot say with absolute certainty, it would appear that the story is intact as far as the roughly two hour running time would allow. Nothing set up is denied pay-off. The jokes and gags are obviously aged, as humor has gone through immense changes over time. However, drunkenness and mix-ups are the basis of a lot of them, and those remain sources of laughter today. The prank played on Malvolio seems harsh and uncalled for today, or at least, by some standards. Fine, by those of mine and my girlfriend, then. The characters are memorable and distinct, in spite of there being about a dozen. Dialog is amazing. The acting is great, and a lot of the funniest moments come from this aspect(Imogen Stubbs in particular). Pacing is reasonable. The editing is well-done, interweaving parallel scenes with one another to strong effect. Whether this is true to the source material, I could not say. This is slightly visual, if the filming is never above average(and at times clumsy). I find the best adaptations of this sort are the ones most based on the verbal content, and that does tend to be the approach here. I recommend this to fans of the excellent writer's comedies. 7/10

    I have been reading and loving Shakespeare since year 6 of primary school. At first I didn't understand the language, but the many discussions we had about it while reading aloud improved my understanding and didn't waver my interest. Twelfth Night mayn't have the most plausible story of all the Shakespeare plays, but it is still a lot of fun. This Twelfth Night is more than worthy. It is not thr best Shakespeare film, not like Othello, Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing and Hamlet, but it does boast a strong cast and impeccable production values. If I had any criticisms against this Twelfth Night, they would be that as well shot and as interesting as the beginning scene was, part of me found it unnecessary compared to the rest of the film and it didn't add much to the storytelling, and also it did feel a little sugar-coated towards the end. Criticisms aside, this is a very beautiful-looking Twelfth Night, with the luscious photography, autumnal imagery and scenery and colourful, sumptuous costumes. The music is full of memorable tunes that also do well to enhance each scene. Trevor Nunn's direction is excellent, the dialogue is intelligently woven and delivered, the story while condensed still maintains the play's fun and spirit, all the relationships are intact and done convincingly and the pace is smart and snappy. The acting is just great. Toby Stephens deserves credit for breathing life to Orsino, when he could easily have been bland and Imogen Stubbs is radiant. In the more comic roles, Malvolio, Sir Andrew and especially Sir Toby are hoots, and Imelda Staunton is a memorable Maria. My favourites here are Helena Bonham Carter and Ben Kingsley as Olivia and Feste, Carter is note perfect and Kingsley gives perhaps his best ever support turn. All in all, a lot of fun and very worthy. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    If Shakespeare were this dead, we'd all be reading Ben Jonson instead. Pretty pictures and big names don't guarantee the illusion of life. We need people to move, to have energy, to make us care about what happens to them. It's a comedy, remember? This was more like a glossy coffee-table picture book of fabulous house interiors. An uninhabited house. Shakespeare wrote a whole raft of interesting people. I wanted to get interested in these people up there on the screen, but they were all on life-support, like a group coma punctuated by an occasional wake. "O for a muse of fire!" Or at least a director with some.

    In William Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" (or, "What You Will"), brother and sister twins "Viola" and "Sebastian" are shipwrecked off the shores of "Illyria". "Viola" mistakenly thinks brother "Sebastian" has drowned. She goes to "Illyria" alone; and, she assumes the identity of a young man, "Cesario". In "Illyria", "Cesario" ("Viola") gets a job as gentleman (dresser) for the duke "Orsino". Male (female) "Cesario" ("Viola") falls in love with (male) "Orsino". But, he loves another woman, "Olivia". Meanwhile, "Olivia" falls in love with the female twin "Cesario" ("Viola"), thinking she is a male. Then, real male twin "Sebastian" returns, undead! Then, all's well that ends well. The supporting characters in director Trevor Nunn's cinematic version are all right (actually, they come off better, due to the overall execution of the film). But, mainly, it's about Imogen Stubbs (as Viola aka Cesario), and her interaction with Toby Stephens (as Orsino) and Helena Bonham Carter (as Olivia). This "Twelfth Night" is very well produced. It seems much more dramatic than comic, which is most obvious in the tone-setting opening. The supporting characters and subplots retain the more comic flavor, though. This portends a promising adaptation. But, the film doesn't really end up as you like it. Ms. Stubbs becomes an endearing "Viola". Both Stubbs and Mr. Stephens, and Stubbs and Ms. Bonham Carter are fun to watch "fall in love". The sexual dynamics work; interestingly, each of the performers add some subtleties. Film, of course, picks up its own (different than stage) nuances. The already shaky premise falls apart, however, when "Sebastian" returns; and, the performers lose credibility very quickly. Originally, a male would more convincingly play BOTH twins. It would have been better to have Stubbs (or even Steven Mackintosh) play both roles. This film points in the right direction; but, next time, either go all the way, or leave "Twelfth Night" on the stage. ****** Twelfth Night (1996) Trevor Nunn ~ Imogen Stubbs, Toby Stephens, Helena Bonham Carter

    Viola and Sebastian are siblings who look quite alike and are very close due to being only alone together since the death of their father. They are entertaining on board a ship when a storm sees Viola lost overboard, with Sebastian diving in after her. Separated and each fearing the other lost to the seas, Viola disguises herself as a man, Cesario and wins the confidence and friendship of Duke Orsino, who seeks Viola's help in wooing Lady Olivia. Olivia is wearing the death of her brother like a constant veil to avoid Orsino as she does not love him  however she quickly finds love for her new visitor "Cesario". If that wasn't bad enough, Olivia's cousin Toby Belch conspires to complicate things further by convincing both the simple Sir Andrew Aguecheek and the pompous servant Malvolio that they are both desired by Olivia. Meanwhile, local man Feste looks on at the madness around him. I do enjoy Shakespeare and enjoy nothing more than the occasional evening down the road in the theatres off the river in Stratford-upon-Avon watching the RSC. However, before anyone thinks I am presenting myself as some form of intellectual, I easily struggle to follow the narrative within the language and will often make sure I know the plot before I start the film so that I can get lost in the flow of the dialogue, miss the meaning of some sections but still follow the overall flow. The "best" productions I have seen on stage and film are presented in such a way to make them accessible to the target audience. With this version of Twelfth Night, I did find some parts of the first half of the film a little hard to get into but as the characters and various threads get developed a bit more. At the start the aspects of farce and slight melancholy don't totally work but as it went on and I got into it, I found that it worked better and better. It is worth saying this because some viewers who struggle at first and maybe are not familiar with the story may bail within twenty minutes, however to do so, in my opinion, would be a mistake. Nunn's direction is mostly good but the one big problem I did have with the delivery was the sound quality. The dialogue is hard to follow as it is but in some scenes the large rooms produce an echo effect that makes it slightly difficult to hear.. This is not down to the actors though and indeed if the film has one overriding strength it is the performances, which are roundly engaging and fun. Stubbs leads the cast well but, if you excuse the irony, she has a rather straight role in comparison to majority of the rest. Bonham-Carter is really well cast and does good work in the object of affection. Stephens is solid, as are Mackintosh, Livingstone and Farrell. Smith and Staunton are fun and they work well with the enjoyable pompous Hawthorne. Similarly Grant gives good moron and Kingsley does good work as Feste, making a strong core outside of the thread to some degree. Overall then an enjoyable and engaging version of the Shakespeare. Viewers may find it a bit hard going in the early stages but, aside from the sound issues, it gets increasingly accessible and enjoyable and is a very good adaptation.

    I've always loved this play. The theme of identical twins is delightful and there are so many laughs. I remembered it well from my schooldays when it was obviously a favourite then too. The earlier performances I've seen never, though, came up to the level of this one. I saw a version starring a very short Viola with an appallingly inappropriate halo of fluffy fair hair who looked totally ridiculous as a man and surely must have seemed to Orsino like a 12 year old page. One would hope Orsino wouldn't be falling for a child page!! And could you imagine this short actress in pageboy clothes and looking no more than a child being courted by the adult Olivia? Ridiculous... So it all made a nonsense of this story and when I tried to watch it again after seeing this version, I could only glance at a few scenes (with a very wet and soulful and completely pathetic Orsino mooning about) in horror and then return it hurriedly to the library. So this version has completely spoiled me for anything twee. I couldn't now accept a pretty diminutive Viola. She must be a sensible height to pass for a young man. Perhaps Viola has previously been played as a page rather than a young man being trained in warfare as in this movie but I think the best reading is that Viola is a strongwilled, adventurous young woman who wouldn't want the kind of conventional life Olivia has and with her brother lost seizes the opportunity to try out living a man's life with all the privileges that would bring in Shakespeare's time. So Imogen Stubbs with her beautiful but also strong features and height and perfect voice is ideal for this part. In the same way, Toby Stephens elevates Orsino from the dismal mooning character too often portrayed. Orsino can't be a wet dreamer. He's the leader of his country in war. He's highly respected and an upright person, made clear in the dialogue. His household is only of men and the indication in this play is that he runs a military academy which is surely exactly what we'd expect of a strong leader engaged in a war with a neighbouring state. Stephens is also extremely handsome, which adds plenty of spice to his character! The brother Sebastian, also excellently played and very charming, is amazingly like his twin in this production which is excellent. Of course we viewers can suspend belief when two actors are this much alike. Hard to imagine that in some productions both parts are played by one actress - this seems to me quite ridiculous nowadays although perfectly feasible in Shakespeare's time since women could not act on stage and the same boy could play both parts. Not allowing the twins to come face to face on stage would be completely bizarre. But I think that today this cannot work. We can't accept Viola played by a man. We can't accept Sebastian played by a girl. So better to suspend belief just a little! Sebastian's admirer Antonio is another splendid part excellently portrayed by Nicholas Farrell. Same applies to all the other actors. Sir Toby is portrayed with much wit but also some undertones of seriousness as he occasionally expresses his frustration at being a poor relation dependent on his niece's charity. Maria is not wasted as a silly bumpkin maid but given dignity and a little pathos. Malvolio becomes as I think he should a rather tragic figure, perfectly portrayed by Nigel Hawthorne especially in that "famous scene"! Sir Andrew is really sweet in his silly way. Helena Bonham Carter makes Olivia delightful and youthful, so suitable to fall for "Cesario. "Ben Kingsley rounds it off with a lovely sharp portrayal of Feste and lovely singing.

    A first-rate cast directed by Trevor Nunn, the premier Shakespeare interpreter of our era, makes this version of Twelfth Night a must-see for anyone who loves Shakespeare. The action appears to take place in the 18th or 19th century but the interpretation is otherwise straight-forward. While reduced from the Shakespearean original to a little over two hours, the script contains all of the essential elements. Nunn takes full advantage of the rugged setting to eliminate the proscenium and draws excellent performances from his cast of British-trained stars led by Helena Bonham Carter as Olivia, Imogen Stubbs as Viola (posing as Rosario), Ben Kingsley as Feste, the clown, Nigel Hawthorne as Malvolio, the proud steward, Mel Smith as Sir Toby Belch who combines with Maria, played by Imelda Stuanton, to reduce Malvolio to ridicule and tears. Viola and her twin brother, Sebastian (Steven MacIntosh), are matched in height and coloring but, as is invariably the case in Twelfth Night, it requires the audience to be blind to the fact that there is no way they could be mistaken for one another. "Suspension of disbelief" is what is required and anyone accustomed to Shakespeare's mistaken identities readily provides it. Sebastian, Viola's twin, has a lesser role, of course, but Steven McIntosh fills it nicely as does Nicholas Farrell as Antonio, who rescues Sebastion from the sea when the ship carrying the twins breaks apart, leading each to believe that the other is dead. The lone weak spot in the cast is Toby Stevens as Orsino, too weak a personality to inspire Viola's love (though his spurning as a suitor by Bonham Carter's Olivia is easy to understand). The plot leading up to Malvolio's fall is stylishly executed and his downfall, in Nigel Hawthorne's extraordinarily capable hands, nearly reaches the level of tragedy.

    In one of the DVD extras, a producer praises director Trevor Nunn as knowing more about Shakespeare than any man in England. (Not true, it's John Barton. But that's another story.) Unfortunately, Nunn attempts to demonstrate his erudition in this beautifully photographed, somewhat medicinal misfire. In an attempt to serve up Shakespeare to everyone, he's bogged himself down in self-conscious paralysis. Despite the beautiful images and the star-studded cast, this is an airless, spineless lump. Imogen Stubbs (Mrs. Nunn) is quite fine as Viola, and Richard E. Grant maintains great energy as Sir Andrew Aguecheek. Just about everybody else is sabotaged by a leaden pace and a heavy directorial hand. Nigel Hawthorne's Malvolio is destroyed by the glacial tempo, and Helena Bonham Carter's charm wilts at half speed. Mel Smith is beautifully cast as Sir Toby Belch, but is also just too darn slow. In a major miscalculation, Ben Kingsley's plays Feste as a menacing ex-con, perhaps Abel Magwitch strayed in from "Great Expectations." This is a Killer Klown from Kornwall. And in order to keep things this sluggish, at least a third of the text of the play is missing. It's the language that makes Shakespeare immortal, not the plots. Bad idea.... Oddly enough, in group scenes, actors often lose character, just standing around staring blankly at whoever is talking. You never see this in films, and you shouldn't. It should never happen. There is a 1969 ITV version circulating with Sir Alec Guinness as Malvolio and Sir Ralph Richardson as Sir Toby Belch to remind us of how far we haven't come. But best of all is the 1980 BBC DVD with Felicity Kendall, Sinead Cusack, Alec McCowen, Robert Hardy and Robert Lindsay. That "Twelfth Night" is an ensemble delight from beginning to end, with a full text and virtually flawless in engaging the play successfully on every level at once. Run, don't walk. It's a genuine treat.

    A lively, bubbly production of one of Shakespeare's more difficult plays. It's hard to know just what Shakespeare was getting at with this story. The text doesn't always seem to make sense. That's reflected in this, as well as any other, production. At times, one wonders what the expressions on characters' faces are meant to indicate. Just after Feste has fooled Malvolio with his imitation of the curate, for instance, Maria has a perturbed look on her face. As if the joke that she herself so elaborately designed now troubles her. There's nothing in the text to indicate that her expression should show remorse; and yet Sir Toby soon after says that he's sick of the whole thing. Why? That's one example of the difficulty of the text (which may have been corrupted over the centuries), and how it is manifested in this particular production's choices. I don't know why Sir Toby remarks at this point that he's sick of the joke, nor do I know whether Maria should share his feelings. Another difficulty is the role of Feste. Ben Kingsley fills this role, and because Ben Kingsley is a major star, he magnifies this character (in my opinion) out of all proportion. He becomes a sort of Zen master, pompous and oppressive. His jokes aren't funny (maybe we can't find Shakespeare's jokes funny today, but Kingsley's heavy delivery precludes humor), and his last confrontation with Malvolio comes off as a sort of thundering divine retribution. The entire play, the entire cast, stops dead and Feste takes over as if the whole point of the play has been his apotheosis at the expense of the degraded Malvolio. This surely cannot be what Shakespeare had in mind. Throughout the play he has a disconcerting habit of staring at other characters or the camera with what almost be described as a leer. Maybe Shakespeare would have sighed and commiserated with the producer of this film, because the clowns in his day were also big stars who demanded a lot of meat in their roles. The trouble is that there just isn't much meat in Feste's role according to the text, so we're stuck with leers and thundering retribution and other inventions. Shakespeare had to accommodate his clowns with ever-more important roles, climaxing with characters like Touchstone and Lear's fool. Kingsley is just inventing his own character. At times his work is interesting, but his weight in the production is, as I said, oppressive. Still, his screen time is relatively small, and much of the rest of the play is a joy, even if the point of the story isn't always clear. Bonham-Carter was never more alluring, Hawthorne is priceless as Malvolio (he was born for the role), and Smith and Grant are the perfect combination of Belch and Aguecheek. I suppose you might object that all four of them put their eyebrows to such prodigious use that their acting might be characterized as hamming. But I don't see how any of these characters can be played straight if the play is to work. One thing is for sure, no one would ever accuse this production of bogging down. The pace is lively, the sets and the cinematography are always striking, the score is invigorating, and I suspect that I could watch this film dubbed in Swahili and it would still be a lot of fun. Visually arresting is perhaps the best description.

    This film is absolutely awesome, I recommend everyone see it! The plot is fascinating and fast paced, it really keeps you guessing what's going to happen next. It's about two very similar twins, Viola and Sebsatian, who are caught in a ship wreck and each believe the other dead. Viola, for protection, dresses up as a boy and goes to work for a powerful Duke (a very dashing Toby Stephens). When the Duke sends his new "male" servant to woo his love, Lady Olivia (the glamorous Helena Bonham Carter), all sorts of chaos reigns, especially when Viola's now identically looking twin brother arrives!! The actors give it their all and make the complicated Shakespearian language much easier to follow. The scenery is the breathtakingly beautiful Cornish coast and the overall feel of the play is one that has been made with great care, yet never tires or becomes bogged down with the complicated language. I had no idea of the story before watching, but found this no obstacle, unlike many other Shakespeare film adaptions. I've never been much of a Shakespeare fan and have only read it when made to in school! After watching this film, however, I have been reading the play itself and have really enjoyed studying the original Shakespeare! There are so many different ideas and themes in the original play, all of which are brought effortlessly to life in the screen! The film also treads well the fine line the play expresses between tragedy and comedy. A brilliant treat of a film that is genuinely funny, heart warming and addicting! One of my all time favourite films I can't seem to stop watching!!!

    In William Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" (or, "What You Will"), brother and sister twins "Viola" and "Sebastian" are shipwrecked off the shores of "Illyria". "Viola" mistakenly thinks brother "Sebastian" has drowned. She goes to "Illyria" alone; and, she assumes the identity of a young man, "Cesario". In "Illyria", "Cesario" ("Viola") gets a job as gentleman (dresser) for the duke "Orsino". Male (female) "Cesario" ("Viola") falls in love with (male) "Orsino". But, he loves another woman, "Olivia". Meanwhile, "Olivia" falls in love with the female twin "Cesario" ("Viola"), thinking she is a male. Then, real male twin "Sebastian" returns, undead! Then, all's well that ends well. The supporting characters in director Trevor Nunn's cinematic version are all right (actually, they come off better, due to the overall execution of the film). But, mainly, it's about Imogen Stubbs (as Viola aka Cesario), and her interaction with Toby Stephens (as Orsino) and Helena Bonham Carter (as Olivia). This "Twelfth Night" is very well produced. It seems much more dramatic than comic, which is most obvious in the tone-setting opening. The supporting characters and subplots retain the more comic flavor, though. This portends a promising adaptation. But, the film doesn't really end up as you like it. Ms. Stubbs becomes an endearing "Viola". Both Stubbs and Mr. Stephens, and Stubbs and Ms. Bonham Carter are fun to watch "fall in love". The sexual dynamics work; interestingly, each of the performers add some subtleties. Film, of course, picks up its own (different than stage) nuances. The already shaky premise falls apart, however, when "Sebastian" returns; and, the performers lose credibility very quickly. Originally, a male would more convincingly play BOTH twins. It would have been better to have Stubbs (or even Steven Mackintosh) play both roles. This film points in the right direction; but, next time, either go all the way, or leave "Twelfth Night" on the stage. ****** Twelfth Night (1996) Trevor Nunn ~ Imogen Stubbs, Toby Stephens, Helena Bonham Carter

    Viola and Sebastian are siblings who look quite alike and are very close due to being only alone together since the death of their father. They are entertaining on board a ship when a storm sees Viola lost overboard, with Sebastian diving in after her. Separated and each fearing the other lost to the seas, Viola disguises herself as a man, Cesario and wins the confidence and friendship of Duke Orsino, who seeks Viola's help in wooing Lady Olivia. Olivia is wearing the death of her brother like a constant veil to avoid Orsino as she does not love him  however she quickly finds love for her new visitor "Cesario". If that wasn't bad enough, Olivia's cousin Toby Belch conspires to complicate things further by convincing both the simple Sir Andrew Aguecheek and the pompous servant Malvolio that they are both desired by Olivia. Meanwhile, local man Feste looks on at the madness around him. I do enjoy Shakespeare and enjoy nothing more than the occasional evening down the road in the theatres off the river in Stratford-upon-Avon watching the RSC. However, before anyone thinks I am presenting myself as some form of intellectual, I easily struggle to follow the narrative within the language and will often make sure I know the plot before I start the film so that I can get lost in the flow of the dialogue, miss the meaning of some sections but still follow the overall flow. The "best" productions I have seen on stage and film are presented in such a way to make them accessible to the target audience. With this version of Twelfth Night, I did find some parts of the first half of the film a little hard to get into but as the characters and various threads get developed a bit more. At the start the aspects of farce and slight melancholy don't totally work but as it went on and I got into it, I found that it worked better and better. It is worth saying this because some viewers who struggle at first and maybe are not familiar with the story may bail within twenty minutes, however to do so, in my opinion, would be a mistake. Nunn's direction is mostly good but the one big problem I did have with the delivery was the sound quality. The dialogue is hard to follow as it is but in some scenes the large rooms produce an echo effect that makes it slightly difficult to hear.. This is not down to the actors though and indeed if the film has one overriding strength it is the performances, which are roundly engaging and fun. Stubbs leads the cast well but, if you excuse the irony, she has a rather straight role in comparison to majority of the rest. Bonham-Carter is really well cast and does good work in the object of affection. Stephens is solid, as are Mackintosh, Livingstone and Farrell. Smith and Staunton are fun and they work well with the enjoyable pompous Hawthorne. Similarly Grant gives good moron and Kingsley does good work as Feste, making a strong core outside of the thread to some degree. Overall then an enjoyable and engaging version of the Shakespeare. Viewers may find it a bit hard going in the early stages but, aside from the sound issues, it gets increasingly accessible and enjoyable and is a very good adaptation.

    I've always loved this play. The theme of identical twins is delightful and there are so many laughs. I remembered it well from my schooldays when it was obviously a favourite then too. The earlier performances I've seen never, though, came up to the level of this one. I saw a version starring a very short Viola with an appallingly inappropriate halo of fluffy fair hair who looked totally ridiculous as a man and surely must have seemed to Orsino like a 12 year old page. One would hope Orsino wouldn't be falling for a child page!! And could you imagine this short actress in pageboy clothes and looking no more than a child being courted by the adult Olivia? Ridiculous... So it all made a nonsense of this story and when I tried to watch it again after seeing this version, I could only glance at a few scenes (with a very wet and soulful and completely pathetic Orsino mooning about) in horror and then return it hurriedly to the library. So this version has completely spoiled me for anything twee. I couldn't now accept a pretty diminutive Viola. She must be a sensible height to pass for a young man. Perhaps Viola has previously been played as a page rather than a young man being trained in warfare as in this movie but I think the best reading is that Viola is a strongwilled, adventurous young woman who wouldn't want the kind of conventional life Olivia has and with her brother lost seizes the opportunity to try out living a man's life with all the privileges that would bring in Shakespeare's time. So Imogen Stubbs with her beautiful but also strong features and height and perfect voice is ideal for this part. In the same way, Toby Stephens elevates Orsino from the dismal mooning character too often portrayed. Orsino can't be a wet dreamer. He's the leader of his country in war. He's highly respected and an upright person, made clear in the dialogue. His household is only of men and the indication in this play is that he runs a military academy which is surely exactly what we'd expect of a strong leader engaged in a war with a neighbouring state. Stephens is also extremely handsome, which adds plenty of spice to his character! The brother Sebastian, also excellently played and very charming, is amazingly like his twin in this production which is excellent. Of course we viewers can suspend belief when two actors are this much alike. Hard to imagine that in some productions both parts are played by one actress - this seems to me quite ridiculous nowadays although perfectly feasible in Shakespeare's time since women could not act on stage and the same boy could play both parts. Not allowing the twins to come face to face on stage would be completely bizarre. But I think that today this cannot work. We can't accept Viola played by a man. We can't accept Sebastian played by a girl. So better to suspend belief just a little! Sebastian's admirer Antonio is another splendid part excellently portrayed by Nicholas Farrell. Same applies to all the other actors. Sir Toby is portrayed with much wit but also some undertones of seriousness as he occasionally expresses his frustration at being a poor relation dependent on his niece's charity. Maria is not wasted as a silly bumpkin maid but given dignity and a little pathos. Malvolio becomes as I think he should a rather tragic figure, perfectly portrayed by Nigel Hawthorne especially in that "famous scene"! Sir Andrew is really sweet in his silly way. Helena Bonham Carter makes Olivia delightful and youthful, so suitable to fall for "Cesario. "Ben Kingsley rounds it off with a lovely sharp portrayal of Feste and lovely singing.

    A first-rate cast directed by Trevor Nunn, the premier Shakespeare interpreter of our era, makes this version of Twelfth Night a must-see for anyone who loves Shakespeare. The action appears to take place in the 18th or 19th century but the interpretation is otherwise straight-forward. While reduced from the Shakespearean original to a little over two hours, the script contains all of the essential elements. Nunn takes full advantage of the rugged setting to eliminate the proscenium and draws excellent performances from his cast of British-trained stars led by Helena Bonham Carter as Olivia, Imogen Stubbs as Viola (posing as Rosario), Ben Kingsley as Feste, the clown, Nigel Hawthorne as Malvolio, the proud steward, Mel Smith as Sir Toby Belch who combines with Maria, played by Imelda Stuanton, to reduce Malvolio to ridicule and tears. Viola and her twin brother, Sebastian (Steven MacIntosh), are matched in height and coloring but, as is invariably the case in Twelfth Night, it requires the audience to be blind to the fact that there is no way they could be mistaken for one another. "Suspension of disbelief" is what is required and anyone accustomed to Shakespeare's mistaken identities readily provides it. Sebastian, Viola's twin, has a lesser role, of course, but Steven McIntosh fills it nicely as does Nicholas Farrell as Antonio, who rescues Sebastion from the sea when the ship carrying the twins breaks apart, leading each to believe that the other is dead. The lone weak spot in the cast is Toby Stevens as Orsino, too weak a personality to inspire Viola's love (though his spurning as a suitor by Bonham Carter's Olivia is easy to understand). The plot leading up to Malvolio's fall is stylishly executed and his downfall, in Nigel Hawthorne's extraordinarily capable hands, nearly reaches the level of tragedy.

    In one of the DVD extras, a producer praises director Trevor Nunn as knowing more about Shakespeare than any man in England. (Not true, it's John Barton. But that's another story.) Unfortunately, Nunn attempts to demonstrate his erudition in this beautifully photographed, somewhat medicinal misfire. In an attempt to serve up Shakespeare to everyone, he's bogged himself down in self-conscious paralysis. Despite the beautiful images and the star-studded cast, this is an airless, spineless lump. Imogen Stubbs (Mrs. Nunn) is quite fine as Viola, and Richard E. Grant maintains great energy as Sir Andrew Aguecheek. Just about everybody else is sabotaged by a leaden pace and a heavy directorial hand. Nigel Hawthorne's Malvolio is destroyed by the glacial tempo, and Helena Bonham Carter's charm wilts at half speed. Mel Smith is beautifully cast as Sir Toby Belch, but is also just too darn slow. In a major miscalculation, Ben Kingsley's plays Feste as a menacing ex-con, perhaps Abel Magwitch strayed in from "Great Expectations." This is a Killer Klown from Kornwall. And in order to keep things this sluggish, at least a third of the text of the play is missing. It's the language that makes Shakespeare immortal, not the plots. Bad idea.... Oddly enough, in group scenes, actors often lose character, just standing around staring blankly at whoever is talking. You never see this in films, and you shouldn't. It should never happen. There is a 1969 ITV version circulating with Sir Alec Guinness as Malvolio and Sir Ralph Richardson as Sir Toby Belch to remind us of how far we haven't come. But best of all is the 1980 BBC DVD with Felicity Kendall, Sinead Cusack, Alec McCowen, Robert Hardy and Robert Lindsay. That "Twelfth Night" is an ensemble delight from beginning to end, with a full text and virtually flawless in engaging the play successfully on every level at once. Run, don't walk. It's a genuine treat.

    A lively, bubbly production of one of Shakespeare's more difficult plays. It's hard to know just what Shakespeare was getting at with this story. The text doesn't always seem to make sense. That's reflected in this, as well as any other, production. At times, one wonders what the expressions on characters' faces are meant to indicate. Just after Feste has fooled Malvolio with his imitation of the curate, for instance, Maria has a perturbed look on her face. As if the joke that she herself so elaborately designed now troubles her. There's nothing in the text to indicate that her expression should show remorse; and yet Sir Toby soon after says that he's sick of the whole thing. Why? That's one example of the difficulty of the text (which may have been corrupted over the centuries), and how it is manifested in this particular production's choices. I don't know why Sir Toby remarks at this point that he's sick of the joke, nor do I know whether Maria should share his feelings. Another difficulty is the role of Feste. Ben Kingsley fills this role, and because Ben Kingsley is a major star, he magnifies this character (in my opinion) out of all proportion. He becomes a sort of Zen master, pompous and oppressive. His jokes aren't funny (maybe we can't find Shakespeare's jokes funny today, but Kingsley's heavy delivery precludes humor), and his last confrontation with Malvolio comes off as a sort of thundering divine retribution. The entire play, the entire cast, stops dead and Feste takes over as if the whole point of the play has been his apotheosis at the expense of the degraded Malvolio. This surely cannot be what Shakespeare had in mind. Throughout the play he has a disconcerting habit of staring at other characters or the camera with what almost be described as a leer. Maybe Shakespeare would have sighed and commiserated with the producer of this film, because the clowns in his day were also big stars who demanded a lot of meat in their roles. The trouble is that there just isn't much meat in Feste's role according to the text, so we're stuck with leers and thundering retribution and other inventions. Shakespeare had to accommodate his clowns with ever-more important roles, climaxing with characters like Touchstone and Lear's fool. Kingsley is just inventing his own character. At times his work is interesting, but his weight in the production is, as I said, oppressive. Still, his screen time is relatively small, and much of the rest of the play is a joy, even if the point of the story isn't always clear. Bonham-Carter was never more alluring, Hawthorne is priceless as Malvolio (he was born for the role), and Smith and Grant are the perfect combination of Belch and Aguecheek. I suppose you might object that all four of them put their eyebrows to such prodigious use that their acting might be characterized as hamming. But I don't see how any of these characters can be played straight if the play is to work. One thing is for sure, no one would ever accuse this production of bogging down. The pace is lively, the sets and the cinematography are always striking, the score is invigorating, and I suspect that I could watch this film dubbed in Swahili and it would still be a lot of fun. Visually arresting is perhaps the best description.

    This film is absolutely awesome, I recommend everyone see it! The plot is fascinating and fast paced, it really keeps you guessing what's going to happen next. It's about two very similar twins, Viola and Sebsatian, who are caught in a ship wreck and each believe the other dead. Viola, for protection, dresses up as a boy and goes to work for a powerful Duke (a very dashing Toby Stephens). When the Duke sends his new "male" servant to woo his love, Lady Olivia (the glamorous Helena Bonham Carter), all sorts of chaos reigns, especially when Viola's now identically looking twin brother arrives!! The actors give it their all and make the complicated Shakespearian language much easier to follow. The scenery is the breathtakingly beautiful Cornish coast and the overall feel of the play is one that has been made with great care, yet never tires or becomes bogged down with the complicated language. I had no idea of the story before watching, but found this no obstacle, unlike many other Shakespeare film adaptions. I've never been much of a Shakespeare fan and have only read it when made to in school! After watching this film, however, I have been reading the play itself and have really enjoyed studying the original Shakespeare! There are so many different ideas and themes in the original play, all of which are brought effortlessly to life in the screen! The film also treads well the fine line the play expresses between tragedy and comedy. A brilliant treat of a film that is genuinely funny, heart warming and addicting! One of my all time favourite films I can't seem to stop watching!!!

    Viola and her twin brother Sebastian are divided and both believe the other to be dead. On unfriendly land, she has to become a servant to Orsini, whom she falls for. To work for him, she has to dress up like a boy(thus commenting on the differences between the genders, and how we relate to the same or the opposite sex). And he wants to be with Olivia, who can't imagine being with her(who she thinks is male), when he sends her to court her. Confused? Then I won't go into the subplots. There is enough unrequited love to go around, and that situation is described well. This is kept in Shakespeare's language(with all it's delicious constructions, several of which have become common sayings today), and whilst I have not read the original play and thus cannot say with absolute certainty, it would appear that the story is intact as far as the roughly two hour running time would allow. Nothing set up is denied pay-off. The jokes and gags are obviously aged, as humor has gone through immense changes over time. However, drunkenness and mix-ups are the basis of a lot of them, and those remain sources of laughter today. The prank played on Malvolio seems harsh and uncalled for today, or at least, by some standards. Fine, by those of mine and my girlfriend, then. The characters are memorable and distinct, in spite of there being about a dozen. Dialog is amazing. The acting is great, and a lot of the funniest moments come from this aspect(Imogen Stubbs in particular). Pacing is reasonable. The editing is well-done, interweaving parallel scenes with one another to strong effect. Whether this is true to the source material, I could not say. This is slightly visual, if the filming is never above average(and at times clumsy). I find the best adaptations of this sort are the ones most based on the verbal content, and that does tend to be the approach here. I recommend this to fans of the excellent writer's comedies. 7/10

    I have been reading and loving Shakespeare since year 6 of primary school. At first I didn't understand the language, but the many discussions we had about it while reading aloud improved my understanding and didn't waver my interest. Twelfth Night mayn't have the most plausible story of all the Shakespeare plays, but it is still a lot of fun. This Twelfth Night is more than worthy. It is not thr best Shakespeare film, not like Othello, Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing and Hamlet, but it does boast a strong cast and impeccable production values. If I had any criticisms against this Twelfth Night, they would be that as well shot and as interesting as the beginning scene was, part of me found it unnecessary compared to the rest of the film and it didn't add much to the storytelling, and also it did feel a little sugar-coated towards the end. Criticisms aside, this is a very beautiful-looking Twelfth Night, with the luscious photography, autumnal imagery and scenery and colourful, sumptuous costumes. The music is full of memorable tunes that also do well to enhance each scene. Trevor Nunn's direction is excellent, the dialogue is intelligently woven and delivered, the story while condensed still maintains the play's fun and spirit, all the relationships are intact and done convincingly and the pace is smart and snappy. The acting is just great. Toby Stephens deserves credit for breathing life to Orsino, when he could easily have been bland and Imogen Stubbs is radiant. In the more comic roles, Malvolio, Sir Andrew and especially Sir Toby are hoots, and Imelda Staunton is a memorable Maria. My favourites here are Helena Bonham Carter and Ben Kingsley as Olivia and Feste, Carter is note perfect and Kingsley gives perhaps his best ever support turn. All in all, a lot of fun and very worthy. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    If Shakespeare were this dead, we'd all be reading Ben Jonson instead. Pretty pictures and big names don't guarantee the illusion of life. We need people to move, to have energy, to make us care about what happens to them. It's a comedy, remember? This was more like a glossy coffee-table picture book of fabulous house interiors. An uninhabited house. Shakespeare wrote a whole raft of interesting people. I wanted to get interested in these people up there on the screen, but they were all on life-support, like a group coma punctuated by an occasional wake. "O for a muse of fire!" Or at least a director with some.

Sir Toby is portrayed with much wit but also some undertones of seriousness as he occasionally expresses his frustration at being a poor relation dependent on his niece's charity. Maria is not wasted as a silly bumpkin maid but given dignity and a little pathos. Malvolio becomes as I think he should a rather tragic figure, perfectly portrayed by Nigel Hawthorne especially in that "famous scene"! Sir Andrew is really sweet in his silly way. Helena Bonham Carter makes Olivia delightful and youthful, so suitable to fall for "Cesario. "Ben Kingsley rounds it off with a lovely sharp portrayal of Feste and lovely singing.

    A first-rate cast directed by Trevor Nunn, the premier Shakespeare interpreter of our era, makes this version of Twelfth Night a must-see for anyone who loves Shakespeare. The action appears to take place in the 18th or 19th century but the interpretation is otherwise straight-forward. While reduced from the Shakespearean original to a little over two hours, the script contains all of the essential elements. Nunn takes full advantage of the rugged setting to eliminate the proscenium and draws excellent performances from his cast of British-trained stars led by Helena Bonham Carter as Olivia, Imogen Stubbs as Viola (posing as Rosario), Ben Kingsley as Feste, the clown, Nigel Hawthorne as Malvolio, the proud steward, Mel Smith as Sir Toby Belch who combines with Maria, played by Imelda Stuanton, to reduce Malvolio to ridicule and tears. Viola and her twin brother, Sebastian (Steven MacIntosh), are matched in height and coloring but, as is invariably the case in Twelfth Night, it requires the audience to be blind to the fact that there is no way they could be mistaken for one another. "Suspension of disbelief" is what is required and anyone accustomed to Shakespeare's mistaken identities readily provides it. Sebastian, Viola's twin, has a lesser role, of course, but Steven McIntosh fills it nicely as does Nicholas Farrell as Antonio, who rescues Sebastion from the sea when the ship carrying the twins breaks apart, leading each to believe that the other is dead. The lone weak spot in the cast is Toby Stevens as Orsino, too weak a personality to inspire Viola's love (though his spurning as a suitor by Bonham Carter's Olivia is easy to understand). The plot leading up to Malvolio's fall is stylishly executed and his downfall, in Nigel Hawthorne's extraordinarily capable hands, nearly reaches the level of tragedy.

    In one of the DVD extras, a producer praises director Trevor Nunn as knowing more about Shakespeare than any man in England. (Not true, it's John Barton. But that's another story.) Unfortunately, Nunn attempts to demonstrate his erudition in this beautifully photographed, somewhat medicinal misfire. In an attempt to serve up Shakespeare to everyone, he's bogged himself down in self-conscious paralysis. Despite the beautiful images and the star-studded cast, this is an airless, spineless lump. Imogen Stubbs (Mrs. Nunn) is quite fine as Viola, and Richard E. Grant maintains great energy as Sir Andrew Aguecheek. Just about everybody else is sabotaged by a leaden pace and a heavy directorial hand. Nigel Hawthorne's Malvolio is destroyed by the glacial tempo, and Helena Bonham Carter's charm wilts at half speed. Mel Smith is beautifully cast as Sir Toby Belch, but is also just too darn slow. In a major miscalculation, Ben Kingsley's plays Feste as a menacing ex-con, perhaps Abel Magwitch strayed in from "Great Expectations." This is a Killer Klown from Kornwall. And in order to keep things this sluggish, at least a third of the text of the play is missing. It's the language that makes Shakespeare immortal, not the plots. Bad idea.... Oddly enough, in group scenes, actors often lose character, just standing around staring blankly at whoever is talking. You never see this in films, and you shouldn't. It should never happen. There is a 1969 ITV version circulating with Sir Alec Guinness as Malvolio and Sir Ralph Richardson as Sir Toby Belch to remind us of how far we haven't come. But best of all is the 1980 BBC DVD with Felicity Kendall, Sinead Cusack, Alec McCowen, Robert Hardy and Robert Lindsay. That "Twelfth Night" is an ensemble delight from beginning to end, with a full text and virtually flawless in engaging the play successfully on every level at once. Run, don't walk. It's a genuine treat.

    A lively, bubbly production of one of Shakespeare's more difficult plays. It's hard to know just what Shakespeare was getting at with this story. The text doesn't always seem to make sense. That's reflected in this, as well as any other, production. At times, one wonders what the expressions on characters' faces are meant to indicate. Just after Feste has fooled Malvolio with his imitation of the curate, for instance, Maria has a perturbed look on her face. As if the joke that she herself so elaborately designed now troubles her. There's nothing in the text to indicate that her expression should show remorse; and yet Sir Toby soon after says that he's sick of the whole thing. Why? That's one example of the difficulty of the text (which may have been corrupted over the centuries), and how it is manifested in this particular production's choices. I don't know why Sir Toby remarks at this point that he's sick of the joke, nor do I know whether Maria should share his feelings. Another difficulty is the role of Feste. Ben Kingsley fills this role, and because Ben Kingsley is a major star, he magnifies this character (in my opinion) out of all proportion. He becomes a sort of Zen master, pompous and oppressive. His jokes aren't funny (maybe we can't find Shakespeare's jokes funny today, but Kingsley's heavy delivery precludes humor), and his last confrontation with Malvolio comes off as a sort of thundering divine retribution. The entire play, the entire cast, stops dead and Feste takes over as if the whole point of the play has been his apotheosis at the expense of the degraded Malvolio. This surely cannot be what Shakespeare had in mind. Throughout the play he has a disconcerting habit of staring at other characters or the camera with what almost be described as a leer. Maybe Shakespeare would have sighed and commiserated with the producer of this film, because the clowns in his day were also big stars who demanded a lot of meat in their roles. The trouble is that there just isn't much meat in Feste's role according to the text, so we're stuck with leers and thundering retribution and other inventions. Shakespeare had to accommodate his clowns with ever-more important roles, climaxing with characters like Touchstone and Lear's fool. Kingsley is just inventing his own character. At times his work is interesting, but his weight in the production is, as I said, oppressive. Still, his screen time is relatively small, and much of the rest of the play is a joy, even if the point of the story isn't always clear. Bonham-Carter was never more alluring, Hawthorne is priceless as Malvolio (he was born for the role), and Smith and Grant are the perfect combination of Belch and Aguecheek. I suppose you might object that all four of them put their eyebrows to such prodigious use that their acting might be characterized as hamming. But I don't see how any of these characters can be played straight if the play is to work. One thing is for sure, no one would ever accuse this production of bogging down. The pace is lively, the sets and the cinematography are always striking, the score is invigorating, and I suspect that I could watch this film dubbed in Swahili and it would still be a lot of fun. Visually arresting is perhaps the best description.

    This film is absolutely awesome, I recommend everyone see it! The plot is fascinating and fast paced, it really keeps you guessing what's going to happen next. It's about two very similar twins, Viola and Sebsatian, who are caught in a ship wreck and each believe the other dead. Viola, for protection, dresses up as a boy and goes to work for a powerful Duke (a very dashing Toby Stephens). When the Duke sends his new "male" servant to woo his love, Lady Olivia (the glamorous Helena Bonham Carter), all sorts of chaos reigns, especially when Viola's now identically looking twin brother arrives!! The actors give it their all and make the complicated Shakespearian language much easier to follow. The scenery is the breathtakingly beautiful Cornish coast and the overall feel of the play is one that has been made with great care, yet never tires or becomes bogged down with the complicated language. I had no idea of the story before watching, but found this no obstacle, unlike many other Shakespeare film adaptions. I've never been much of a Shakespeare fan and have only read it when made to in school! After watching this film, however, I have been reading the play itself and have really enjoyed studying the original Shakespeare! There are so many different ideas and themes in the original play, all of which are brought effortlessly to life in the screen! The film also treads well the fine line the play expresses between tragedy and comedy. A brilliant treat of a film that is genuinely funny, heart warming and addicting! One of my all time favourite films I can't seem to stop watching!!!

    Viola and her twin brother Sebastian are divided and both believe the other to be dead. On unfriendly land, she has to become a servant to Orsini, whom she falls for. To work for him, she has to dress up like a boy(thus commenting on the differences between the genders, and how we relate to the same or the opposite sex). And he wants to be with Olivia, who can't imagine being with her(who she thinks is male), when he sends her to court her. Confused? Then I won't go into the subplots. There is enough unrequited love to go around, and that situation is described well. This is kept in Shakespeare's language(with all it's delicious constructions, several of which have become common sayings today), and whilst I have not read the original play and thus cannot say with absolute certainty, it would appear that the story is intact as far as the roughly two hour running time would allow. Nothing set up is denied pay-off. The jokes and gags are obviously aged, as humor has gone through immense changes over time. However, drunkenness and mix-ups are the basis of a lot of them, and those remain sources of laughter today. The prank played on Malvolio seems harsh and uncalled for today, or at least, by some standards. Fine, by those of mine and my girlfriend, then. The characters are memorable and distinct, in spite of there being about a dozen. Dialog is amazing. The acting is great, and a lot of the funniest moments come from this aspect(Imogen Stubbs in particular). Pacing is reasonable. The editing is well-done, interweaving parallel scenes with one another to strong effect. Whether this is true to the source material, I could not say. This is slightly visual, if the filming is never above average(and at times clumsy). I find the best adaptations of this sort are the ones most based on the verbal content, and that does tend to be the approach here. I recommend this to fans of the excellent writer's comedies. 7/10

    I have been reading and loving Shakespeare since year 6 of primary school. At first I didn't understand the language, but the many discussions we had about it while reading aloud improved my understanding and didn't waver my interest. Twelfth Night mayn't have the most plausible story of all the Shakespeare plays, but it is still a lot of fun. This Twelfth Night is more than worthy. It is not thr best Shakespeare film, not like Othello, Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing and Hamlet, but it does boast a strong cast and impeccable production values. If I had any criticisms against this Twelfth Night, they would be that as well shot and as interesting as the beginning scene was, part of me found it unnecessary compared to the rest of the film and it didn't add much to the storytelling, and also it did feel a little sugar-coated towards the end. Criticisms aside, this is a very beautiful-looking Twelfth Night, with the luscious photography, autumnal imagery and scenery and colourful, sumptuous costumes. The music is full of memorable tunes that also do well to enhance each scene. Trevor Nunn's direction is excellent, the dialogue is intelligently woven and delivered, the story while condensed still maintains the play's fun and spirit, all the relationships are intact and done convincingly and the pace is smart and snappy. The acting is just great. Toby Stephens deserves credit for breathing life to Orsino, when he could easily have been bland and Imogen Stubbs is radiant. In the more comic roles, Malvolio, Sir Andrew and especially Sir Toby are hoots, and Imelda Staunton is a memorable Maria. My favourites here are Helena Bonham Carter and Ben Kingsley as Olivia and Feste, Carter is note perfect and Kingsley gives perhaps his best ever support turn. All in all, a lot of fun and very worthy. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    If Shakespeare were this dead, we'd all be reading Ben Jonson instead. Pretty pictures and big names don't guarantee the illusion of life. We need people to move, to have energy, to make us care about what happens to them. It's a comedy, remember? This was more like a glossy coffee-table picture book of fabulous house interiors. An uninhabited house. Shakespeare wrote a whole raft of interesting people. I wanted to get interested in these people up there on the screen, but they were all on life-support, like a group coma punctuated by an occasional wake. "O for a muse of fire!" Or at least a director with some.

    In William Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" (or, "What You Will"), brother and sister twins "Viola" and "Sebastian" are shipwrecked off the shores of "Illyria". "Viola" mistakenly thinks brother "Sebastian" has drowned. She goes to "Illyria" alone; and, she assumes the identity of a young man, "Cesario". In "Illyria", "Cesario" ("Viola") gets a job as gentleman (dresser) for the duke "Orsino". Male (female) "Cesario" ("Viola") falls in love with (male) "Orsino". But, he loves another woman, "Olivia". Meanwhile, "Olivia" falls in love with the female twin "Cesario" ("Viola"), thinking she is a male. Then, real male twin "Sebastian" returns, undead! Then, all's well that ends well. The supporting characters in director Trevor Nunn's cinematic version are all right (actually, they come off better, due to the overall execution of the film). But, mainly, it's about Imogen Stubbs (as Viola aka Cesario), and her interaction with Toby Stephens (as Orsino) and Helena Bonham Carter (as Olivia). This "Twelfth Night" is very well produced. It seems much more dramatic than comic, which is most obvious in the tone-setting opening. The supporting characters and subplots retain the more comic flavor, though. This portends a promising adaptation. But, the film doesn't really end up as you like it. Ms. Stubbs becomes an endearing "Viola". Both Stubbs and Mr. Stephens, and Stubbs and Ms. Bonham Carter are fun to watch "fall in love". The sexual dynamics work; interestingly, each of the performers add some subtleties. Film, of course, picks up its own (different than stage) nuances. The already shaky premise falls apart, however, when "Sebastian" returns; and, the performers lose credibility very quickly. Originally, a male would more convincingly play BOTH twins. It would have been better to have Stubbs (or even Steven Mackintosh) play both roles. This film points in the right direction; but, next time, either go all the way, or leave "Twelfth Night" on the stage. ****** Twelfth Night (1996) Trevor Nunn ~ Imogen Stubbs, Toby Stephens, Helena Bonham Carter

    Viola and Sebastian are siblings who look quite alike and are very close due to being only alone together since the death of their father. They are entertaining on board a ship when a storm sees Viola lost overboard, with Sebastian diving in after her. Separated and each fearing the other lost to the seas, Viola disguises herself as a man, Cesario and wins the confidence and friendship of Duke Orsino, who seeks Viola's help in wooing Lady Olivia. Olivia is wearing the death of her brother like a constant veil to avoid Orsino as she does not love him  however she quickly finds love for her new visitor "Cesario". If that wasn't bad enough, Olivia's cousin Toby Belch conspires to complicate things further by convincing both the simple Sir Andrew Aguecheek and the pompous servant Malvolio that they are both desired by Olivia. Meanwhile, local man Feste looks on at the madness around him. I do enjoy Shakespeare and enjoy nothing more than the occasional evening down the road in the theatres off the river in Stratford-upon-Avon watching the RSC. However, before anyone thinks I am presenting myself as some form of intellectual, I easily struggle to follow the narrative within the language and will often make sure I know the plot before I start the film so that I can get lost in the flow of the dialogue, miss the meaning of some sections but still follow the overall flow. The "best" productions I have seen on stage and film are presented in such a way to make them accessible to the target audience. With this version of Twelfth Night, I did find some parts of the first half of the film a little hard to get into but as the characters and various threads get developed a bit more. At the start the aspects of farce and slight melancholy don't totally work but as it went on and I got into it, I found that it worked better and better. It is worth saying this because some viewers who struggle at first and maybe are not familiar with the story may bail within twenty minutes, however to do so, in my opinion, would be a mistake. Nunn's direction is mostly good but the one big problem I did have with the delivery was the sound quality. The dialogue is hard to follow as it is but in some scenes the large rooms produce an echo effect that makes it slightly difficult to hear.. This is not down to the actors though and indeed if the film has one overriding strength it is the performances, which are roundly engaging and fun. Stubbs leads the cast well but, if you excuse the irony, she has a rather straight role in comparison to majority of the rest. Bonham-Carter is really well cast and does good work in the object of affection. Stephens is solid, as are Mackintosh, Livingstone and Farrell. Smith and Staunton are fun and they work well with the enjoyable pompous Hawthorne. Similarly Grant gives good moron and Kingsley does good work as Feste, making a strong core outside of the thread to some degree. Overall then an enjoyable and engaging version of the Shakespeare. Viewers may find it a bit hard going in the early stages but, aside from the sound issues, it gets increasingly accessible and enjoyable and is a very good adaptation.

    I've always loved this play. The theme of identical twins is delightful and there are so many laughs. I remembered it well from my schooldays when it was obviously a favourite then too. The earlier performances I've seen never, though, came up to the level of this one. I saw a version starring a very short Viola with an appallingly inappropriate halo of fluffy fair hair who looked totally ridiculous as a man and surely must have seemed to Orsino like a 12 year old page. One would hope Orsino wouldn't be falling for a child page!! And could you imagine this short actress in pageboy clothes and looking no more than a child being courted by the adult Olivia? Ridiculous... So it all made a nonsense of this story and when I tried to watch it again after seeing this version, I could only glance at a few scenes (with a very wet and soulful and completely pathetic Orsino mooning about) in horror and then return it hurriedly to the library. So this version has completely spoiled me for anything twee. I couldn't now accept a pretty diminutive Viola. She must be a sensible height to pass for a young man. Perhaps Viola has previously been played as a page rather than a young man being trained in warfare as in this movie but I think the best reading is that Viola is a strongwilled, adventurous young woman who wouldn't want the kind of conventional life Olivia has and with her brother lost seizes the opportunity to try out living a man's life with all the privileges that would bring in Shakespeare's time. So Imogen Stubbs with her beautiful but also strong features and height and perfect voice is ideal for this part. In the same way, Toby Stephens elevates Orsino from the dismal mooning character too often portrayed. Orsino can't be a wet dreamer. He's the leader of his country in war. He's highly respected and an upright person, made clear in the dialogue. His household is only of men and the indication in this play is that he runs a military academy which is surely exactly what we'd expect of a strong leader engaged in a war with a neighbouring state. Stephens is also extremely handsome, which adds plenty of spice to his character! The brother Sebastian, also excellently played and very charming, is amazingly like his twin in this production which is excellent. Of course we viewers can suspend belief when two actors are this much alike. Hard to imagine that in some productions both parts are played by one actress - this seems to me quite ridiculous nowadays although perfectly feasible in Shakespeare's time since women could not act on stage and the same boy could play both parts. Not allowing the twins to come face to face on stage would be completely bizarre. But I think that today this cannot work. We can't accept Viola played by a man. We can't accept Sebastian played by a girl. So better to suspend belief just a little! Sebastian's admirer Antonio is another splendid part excellently portrayed by Nicholas Farrell. Same applies to all the other actors. Sir Toby is portrayed with much wit but also some undertones of seriousness as he occasionally expresses his frustration at being a poor relation dependent on his niece's charity. Maria is not wasted as a silly bumpkin maid but given dignity and a little pathos. Malvolio becomes as I think he should a rather tragic figure, perfectly portrayed by Nigel Hawthorne especially in that "famous scene"! Sir Andrew is really sweet in his silly way. Helena Bonham Carter makes Olivia delightful and youthful, so suitable to fall for "Cesario. "Ben Kingsley rounds it off with a lovely sharp portrayal of Feste and lovely singing.

    This film is absolutely awesome, I recommend everyone see it! The plot is fascinating and fast paced, it really keeps you guessing what's going to happen next. It's about two very similar twins, Viola and Sebsatian, who are caught in a ship wreck and each believe the other dead. Viola, for protection, dresses up as a boy and goes to work for a powerful Duke (a very dashing Toby Stephens). When the Duke sends his new "male" servant to woo his love, Lady Olivia (the glamorous Helena Bonham Carter), all sorts of chaos reigns, especially when Viola's now identically looking twin brother arrives!! The actors give it their all and make the complicated Shakespearian language much easier to follow. The scenery is the breathtakingly beautiful Cornish coast and the overall feel of the play is one that has been made with great care, yet never tires or becomes bogged down with the complicated language. I had no idea of the story before watching, but found this no obstacle, unlike many other Shakespeare film adaptions. I've never been much of a Shakespeare fan and have only read it when made to in school! After watching this film, however, I have been reading the play itself and have really enjoyed studying the original Shakespeare! There are so many different ideas and themes in the original play, all of which are brought effortlessly to life in the screen! The film also treads well the fine line the play expresses between tragedy and comedy. A brilliant treat of a film that is genuinely funny, heart warming and addicting! One of my all time favourite films I can't seem to stop watching!!!

    Viola and her twin brother Sebastian are divided and both believe the other to be dead. On unfriendly land, she has to become a servant to Orsini, whom she falls for. To work for him, she has to dress up like a boy(thus commenting on the differences between the genders, and how we relate to the same or the opposite sex). And he wants to be with Olivia, who can't imagine being with her(who she thinks is male), when he sends her to court her. Confused? Then I won't go into the subplots. There is enough unrequited love to go around, and that situation is described well. This is kept in Shakespeare's language(with all it's delicious constructions, several of which have become common sayings today), and whilst I have not read the original play and thus cannot say with absolute certainty, it would appear that the story is intact as far as the roughly two hour running time would allow. Nothing set up is denied pay-off. The jokes and gags are obviously aged, as humor has gone through immense changes over time. However, drunkenness and mix-ups are the basis of a lot of them, and those remain sources of laughter today. The prank played on Malvolio seems harsh and uncalled for today, or at least, by some standards. Fine, by those of mine and my girlfriend, then. The characters are memorable and distinct, in spite of there being about a dozen. Dialog is amazing. The acting is great, and a lot of the funniest moments come from this aspect(Imogen Stubbs in particular). Pacing is reasonable. The editing is well-done, interweaving parallel scenes with one another to strong effect. Whether this is true to the source material, I could not say. This is slightly visual, if the filming is never above average(and at times clumsy). I find the best adaptations of this sort are the ones most based on the verbal content, and that does tend to be the approach here. I recommend this to fans of the excellent writer's comedies. 7/10

    I have been reading and loving Shakespeare since year 6 of primary school. At first I didn't understand the language, but the many discussions we had about it while reading aloud improved my understanding and didn't waver my interest. Twelfth Night mayn't have the most plausible story of all the Shakespeare plays, but it is still a lot of fun. This Twelfth Night is more than worthy. It is not thr best Shakespeare film, not like Othello, Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing and Hamlet, but it does boast a strong cast and impeccable production values. If I had any criticisms against this Twelfth Night, they would be that as well shot and as interesting as the beginning scene was, part of me found it unnecessary compared to the rest of the film and it didn't add much to the storytelling, and also it did feel a little sugar-coated towards the end. Criticisms aside, this is a very beautiful-looking Twelfth Night, with the luscious photography, autumnal imagery and scenery and colourful, sumptuous costumes. The music is full of memorable tunes that also do well to enhance each scene. Trevor Nunn's direction is excellent, the dialogue is intelligently woven and delivered, the story while condensed still maintains the play's fun and spirit, all the relationships are intact and done convincingly and the pace is smart and snappy. The acting is just great. Toby Stephens deserves credit for breathing life to Orsino, when he could easily have been bland and Imogen Stubbs is radiant. In the more comic roles, Malvolio, Sir Andrew and especially Sir Toby are hoots, and Imelda Staunton is a memorable Maria. My favourites here are Helena Bonham Carter and Ben Kingsley as Olivia and Feste, Carter is note perfect and Kingsley gives perhaps his best ever support turn. All in all, a lot of fun and very worthy. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    If Shakespeare were this dead, we'd all be reading Ben Jonson instead. Pretty pictures and big names don't guarantee the illusion of life. We need people to move, to have energy, to make us care about what happens to them. It's a comedy, remember? This was more like a glossy coffee-table picture book of fabulous house interiors. An uninhabited house. Shakespeare wrote a whole raft of interesting people. I wanted to get interested in these people up there on the screen, but they were all on life-support, like a group coma punctuated by an occasional wake. "O for a muse of fire!" Or at least a director with some.

    In William Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" (or, "What You Will"), brother and sister twins "Viola" and "Sebastian" are shipwrecked off the shores of "Illyria". "Viola" mistakenly thinks brother "Sebastian" has drowned. She goes to "Illyria" alone; and, she assumes the identity of a young man, "Cesario". In "Illyria", "Cesario" ("Viola") gets a job as gentleman (dresser) for the duke "Orsino". Male (female) "Cesario" ("Viola") falls in love with (male) "Orsino". But, he loves another woman, "Olivia". Meanwhile, "Olivia" falls in love with the female twin "Cesario" ("Viola"), thinking she is a male. Then, real male twin "Sebastian" returns, undead! Then, all's well that ends well. The supporting characters in director Trevor Nunn's cinematic version are all right (actually, they come off better, due to the overall execution of the film). But, mainly, it's about Imogen Stubbs (as Viola aka Cesario), and her interaction with Toby Stephens (as Orsino) and Helena Bonham Carter (as Olivia). This "Twelfth Night" is very well produced. It seems much more dramatic than comic, which is most obvious in the tone-setting opening. The supporting characters and subplots retain the more comic flavor, though. This portends a promising adaptation. But, the film doesn't really end up as you like it. Ms. Stubbs becomes an endearing "Viola". Both Stubbs and Mr. Stephens, and Stubbs and Ms. Bonham Carter are fun to watch "fall in love". The sexual dynamics work; interestingly, each of the performers add some subtleties. Film, of course, picks up its own (different than stage) nuances. The already shaky premise falls apart, however, when "Sebastian" returns; and, the performers lose credibility very quickly. Originally, a male would more convincingly play BOTH twins. It would have been better to have Stubbs (or even Steven Mackintosh) play both roles. This film points in the right direction; but, next time, either go all the way, or leave "Twelfth Night" on the stage. ****** Twelfth Night (1996) Trevor Nunn ~ Imogen Stubbs, Toby Stephens, Helena Bonham Carter

    Viola and Sebastian are siblings who look quite alike and are very close due to being only alone together since the death of their father. They are entertaining on board a ship when a storm sees Viola lost overboard, with Sebastian diving in after her. Separated and each fearing the other lost to the seas, Viola disguises herself as a man, Cesario and wins the confidence and friendship of Duke Orsino, who seeks Viola's help in wooing Lady Olivia. Olivia is wearing the death of her brother like a constant veil to avoid Orsino as she does not love him  however she quickly finds love for her new visitor "Cesario". If that wasn't bad enough, Olivia's cousin Toby Belch conspires to complicate things further by convincing both the simple Sir Andrew Aguecheek and the pompous servant Malvolio that they are both desired by Olivia. Meanwhile, local man Feste looks on at the madness around him. I do enjoy Shakespeare and enjoy nothing more than the occasional evening down the road in the theatres off the river in Stratford-upon-Avon watching the RSC. However, before anyone thinks I am presenting myself as some form of intellectual, I easily struggle to follow the narrative within the language and will often make sure I know the plot before I start the film so that I can get lost in the flow of the dialogue, miss the meaning of some sections but still follow the overall flow. The "best" productions I have seen on stage and film are presented in such a way to make them accessible to the target audience. With this version of Twelfth Night, I did find some parts of the first half of the film a little hard to get into but as the characters and various threads get developed a bit more. At the start the aspects of farce and slight melancholy don't totally work but as it went on and I got into it, I found that it worked better and better. It is worth saying this because some viewers who struggle at first and maybe are not familiar with the story may bail within twenty minutes, however to do so, in my opinion, would be a mistake. Nunn's direction is mostly good but the one big problem I did have with the delivery was the sound quality. The dialogue is hard to follow as it is but in some scenes the large rooms produce an echo effect that makes it slightly difficult to hear.. This is not down to the actors though and indeed if the film has one overriding strength it is the performances, which are roundly engaging and fun. Stubbs leads the cast well but, if you excuse the irony, she has a rather straight role in comparison to majority of the rest. Bonham-Carter is really well cast and does good work in the object of affection. Stephens is solid, as are Mackintosh, Livingstone and Farrell. Smith and Staunton are fun and they work well with the enjoyable pompous Hawthorne. Similarly Grant gives good moron and Kingsley does good work as Feste, making a strong core outside of the thread to some degree. Overall then an enjoyable and engaging version of the Shakespeare. Viewers may find it a bit hard going in the early stages but, aside from the sound issues, it gets increasingly accessible and enjoyable and is a very good adaptation.

    I've always loved this play. The theme of identical twins is delightful and there are so many laughs. I remembered it well from my schooldays when it was obviously a favourite then too. The earlier performances I've seen never, though, came up to the level of this one. I saw a version starring a very short Viola with an appallingly inappropriate halo of fluffy fair hair who looked totally ridiculous as a man and surely must have seemed to Orsino like a 12 year old page. One would hope Orsino wouldn't be falling for a child page!! And could you imagine this short actress in pageboy clothes and looking no more than a child being courted by the adult Olivia? Ridiculous... So it all made a nonsense of this story and when I tried to watch it again after seeing this version, I could only glance at a few scenes (with a very wet and soulful and completely pathetic Orsino mooning about) in horror and then return it hurriedly to the library. So this version has completely spoiled me for anything twee. I couldn't now accept a pretty diminutive Viola. She must be a sensible height to pass for a young man. Perhaps Viola has previously been played as a page rather than a young man being trained in warfare as in this movie but I think the best reading is that Viola is a strongwilled, adventurous young woman who wouldn't want the kind of conventional life Olivia has and with her brother lost seizes the opportunity to try out living a man's life with all the privileges that would bring in Shakespeare's time. So Imogen Stubbs with her beautiful but also strong features and height and perfect voice is ideal for this part. In the same way, Toby Stephens elevates Orsino from the dismal mooning character too often portrayed. Orsino can't be a wet dreamer. He's the leader of his country in war. He's highly respected and an upright person, made clear in the dialogue. His household is only of men and the indication in this play is that he runs a military academy which is surely exactly what we'd expect of a strong leader engaged in a war with a neighbouring state. Stephens is also extremely handsome, which adds plenty of spice to his character! The brother Sebastian, also excellently played and very charming, is amazingly like his twin in this production which is excellent. Of course we viewers can suspend belief when two actors are this much alike. Hard to imagine that in some productions both parts are played by one actress - this seems to me quite ridiculous nowadays although perfectly feasible in Shakespeare's time since women could not act on stage and the same boy could play both parts. Not allowing the twins to come face to face on stage would be completely bizarre. But I think that today this cannot work. We can't accept Viola played by a man. We can't accept Sebastian played by a girl. So better to suspend belief just a little! Sebastian's admirer Antonio is another splendid part excellently portrayed by Nicholas Farrell. Same applies to all the other actors. Sir Toby is portrayed with much wit but also some undertones of seriousness as he occasionally expresses his frustration at being a poor relation dependent on his niece's charity. Maria is not wasted as a silly bumpkin maid but given dignity and a little pathos. Malvolio becomes as I think he should a rather tragic figure, perfectly portrayed by Nigel Hawthorne especially in that "famous scene"! Sir Andrew is really sweet in his silly way. Helena Bonham Carter makes Olivia delightful and youthful, so suitable to fall for "Cesario. "Ben Kingsley rounds it off with a lovely sharp portrayal of Feste and lovely singing.

    A first-rate cast directed by Trevor Nunn, the premier Shakespeare interpreter of our era, makes this version of Twelfth Night a must-see for anyone who loves Shakespeare. The action appears to take place in the 18th or 19th century but the interpretation is otherwise straight-forward. While reduced from the Shakespearean original to a little over two hours, the script contains all of the essential elements. Nunn takes full advantage of the rugged setting to eliminate the proscenium and draws excellent performances from his cast of British-trained stars led by Helena Bonham Carter as Olivia, Imogen Stubbs as Viola (posing as Rosario), Ben Kingsley as Feste, the clown, Nigel Hawthorne as Malvolio, the proud steward, Mel Smith as Sir Toby Belch who combines with Maria, played by Imelda Stuanton, to reduce Malvolio to ridicule and tears. Viola and her twin brother, Sebastian (Steven MacIntosh), are matched in height and coloring but, as is invariably the case in Twelfth Night, it requires the audience to be blind to the fact that there is no way they could be mistaken for one another. "Suspension of disbelief" is what is required and anyone accustomed to Shakespeare's mistaken identities readily provides it. Sebastian, Viola's twin, has a lesser role, of course, but Steven McIntosh fills it nicely as does Nicholas Farrell as Antonio, who rescues Sebastion from the sea when the ship carrying the twins breaks apart, leading each to believe that the other is dead. The lone weak spot in the cast is Toby Stevens as Orsino, too weak a personality to inspire Viola's love (though his spurning as a suitor by Bonham Carter's Olivia is easy to understand). The plot leading up to Malvolio's fall is stylishly executed and his downfall, in Nigel Hawthorne's extraordinarily capable hands, nearly reaches the level of tragedy.

    In one of the DVD extras, a producer praises director Trevor Nunn as knowing more about Shakespeare than any man in England. (Not true, it's John Barton. But that's another story.) Unfortunately, Nunn attempts to demonstrate his erudition in this beautifully photographed, somewhat medicinal misfire. In an attempt to serve up Shakespeare to everyone, he's bogged himself down in self-conscious paralysis. Despite the beautiful images and the star-studded cast, this is an airless, spineless lump. Imogen Stubbs (Mrs. Nunn) is quite fine as Viola, and Richard E. Grant maintains great energy as Sir Andrew Aguecheek. Just about everybody else is sabotaged by a leaden pace and a heavy directorial hand. Nigel Hawthorne's Malvolio is destroyed by the glacial tempo, and Helena Bonham Carter's charm wilts at half speed. Mel Smith is beautifully cast as Sir Toby Belch, but is also just too darn slow. In a major miscalculation, Ben Kingsley's plays Feste as a menacing ex-con, perhaps Abel Magwitch strayed in from "Great Expectations." This is a Killer Klown from Kornwall. And in order to keep things this sluggish, at least a third of the text of the play is missing. It's the language that makes Shakespeare immortal, not the plots. Bad idea.... Oddly enough, in group scenes, actors often lose character, just standing around staring blankly at whoever is talking. You never see this in films, and you shouldn't. It should never happen. There is a 1969 ITV version circulating with Sir Alec Guinness as Malvolio and Sir Ralph Richardson as Sir Toby Belch to remind us of how far we haven't come. But best of all is the 1980 BBC DVD with Felicity Kendall, Sinead Cusack, Alec McCowen, Robert Hardy and Robert Lindsay. That "Twelfth Night" is an ensemble delight from beginning to end, with a full text and virtually flawless in engaging the play successfully on every level at once. Run, don't walk. It's a genuine treat.

    A lively, bubbly production of one of Shakespeare's more difficult plays. It's hard to know just what Shakespeare was getting at with this story. The text doesn't always seem to make sense. That's reflected in this, as well as any other, production. At times, one wonders what the expressions on characters' faces are meant to indicate. Just after Feste has fooled Malvolio with his imitation of the curate, for instance, Maria has a perturbed look on her face. As if the joke that she herself so elaborately designed now troubles her. There's nothing in the text to indicate that her expression should show remorse; and yet Sir Toby soon after says that he's sick of the whole thing. Why? That's one example of the difficulty of the text (which may have been corrupted over the centuries), and how it is manifested in this particular production's choices. I don't know why Sir Toby remarks at this point that he's sick of the joke, nor do I know whether Maria should share his feelings. Another difficulty is the role of Feste. Ben Kingsley fills this role, and because Ben Kingsley is a major star, he magnifies this character (in my opinion) out of all proportion. He becomes a sort of Zen master, pompous and oppressive. His jokes aren't funny (maybe we can't find Shakespeare's jokes funny today, but Kingsley's heavy delivery precludes humor), and his last confrontation with Malvolio comes off as a sort of thundering divine retribution. The entire play, the entire cast, stops dead and Feste takes over as if the whole point of the play has been his apotheosis at the expense of the degraded Malvolio. This surely cannot be what Shakespeare had in mind. Throughout the play he has a disconcerting habit of staring at other characters or the camera with what almost be described as a leer. Maybe Shakespeare would have sighed and commiserated with the producer of this film, because the clowns in his day were also big stars who demanded a lot of meat in their roles. The trouble is that there just isn't much meat in Feste's role according to the text, so we're stuck with leers and thundering retribution and other inventions. Shakespeare had to accommodate his clowns with ever-more important roles, climaxing with characters like Touchstone and Lear's fool. Kingsley is just inventing his own character. At times his work is interesting, but his weight in the production is, as I said, oppressive. Still, his screen time is relatively small, and much of the rest of the play is a joy, even if the point of the story isn't always clear. Bonham-Carter was never more alluring, Hawthorne is priceless as Malvolio (he was born for the role), and Smith and Grant are the perfect combination of Belch and Aguecheek. I suppose you might object that all four of them put their eyebrows to such prodigious use that their acting might be characterized as hamming. But I don't see how any of these characters can be played straight if the play is to work. One thing is for sure, no one would ever accuse this production of bogging down. The pace is lively, the sets and the cinematography are always striking, the score is invigorating, and I suspect that I could watch this film dubbed in Swahili and it would still be a lot of fun. Visually arresting is perhaps the best description.

The supporting characters in director Trevor Nunn's cinematic version are all right (actually, they come off better, due to the overall execution of the film). But, mainly, it's about Imogen Stubbs (as Viola aka Cesario), and her interaction with Toby Stephens (as Orsino) and Helena Bonham Carter (as Olivia). This "Twelfth Night" is very well produced. It seems much more dramatic than comic, which is most obvious in the tone-setting opening. The supporting characters and subplots retain the more comic flavor, though. This portends a promising adaptation. But, the film doesn't really end up as you like it. Ms. Stubbs becomes an endearing "Viola". Both Stubbs and Mr. Stephens, and Stubbs and Ms. Bonham Carter are fun to watch "fall in love". The sexual dynamics work; interestingly, each of the performers add some subtleties. Film, of course, picks up its own (different than stage) nuances. The already shaky premise falls apart, however, when "Sebastian" returns; and, the performers lose credibility very quickly. Originally, a male would more convincingly play BOTH twins. It would have been better to have Stubbs (or even Steven Mackintosh) play both roles. This film points in the right direction; but, next time, either go all the way, or leave "Twelfth Night" on the stage. ****** Twelfth Night (1996) Trevor Nunn ~ Imogen Stubbs, Toby Stephens, Helena Bonham Carter

    Viola and Sebastian are siblings who look quite alike and are very close due to being only alone together since the death of their father. They are entertaining on board a ship when a storm sees Viola lost overboard, with Sebastian diving in after her. Separated and each fearing the other lost to the seas, Viola disguises herself as a man, Cesario and wins the confidence and friendship of Duke Orsino, who seeks Viola's help in wooing Lady Olivia. Olivia is wearing the death of her brother like a constant veil to avoid Orsino as she does not love him  however she quickly finds love for her new visitor "Cesario". If that wasn't bad enough, Olivia's cousin Toby Belch conspires to complicate things further by convincing both the simple Sir Andrew Aguecheek and the pompous servant Malvolio that they are both desired by Olivia. Meanwhile, local man Feste looks on at the madness around him. I do enjoy Shakespeare and enjoy nothing more than the occasional evening down the road in the theatres off the river in Stratford-upon-Avon watching the RSC. However, before anyone thinks I am presenting myself as some form of intellectual, I easily struggle to follow the narrative within the language and will often make sure I know the plot before I start the film so that I can get lost in the flow of the dialogue, miss the meaning of some sections but still follow the overall flow. The "best" productions I have seen on stage and film are presented in such a way to make them accessible to the target audience. With this version of Twelfth Night, I did find some parts of the first half of the film a little hard to get into but as the characters and various threads get developed a bit more. At the start the aspects of farce and slight melancholy don't totally work but as it went on and I got into it, I found that it worked better and better. It is worth saying this because some viewers who struggle at first and maybe are not familiar with the story may bail within twenty minutes, however to do so, in my opinion, would be a mistake. Nunn's direction is mostly good but the one big problem I did have with the delivery was the sound quality. The dialogue is hard to follow as it is but in some scenes the large rooms produce an echo effect that makes it slightly difficult to hear.. This is not down to the actors though and indeed if the film has one overriding strength it is the performances, which are roundly engaging and fun. Stubbs leads the cast well but, if you excuse the irony, she has a rather straight role in comparison to majority of the rest. Bonham-Carter is really well cast and does good work in the object of affection. Stephens is solid, as are Mackintosh, Livingstone and Farrell. Smith and Staunton are fun and they work well with the enjoyable pompous Hawthorne. Similarly Grant gives good moron and Kingsley does good work as Feste, making a strong core outside of the thread to some degree. Overall then an enjoyable and engaging version of the Shakespeare. Viewers may find it a bit hard going in the early stages but, aside from the sound issues, it gets increasingly accessible and enjoyable and is a very good adaptation.

    I've always loved this play. The theme of identical twins is delightful and there are so many laughs. I remembered it well from my schooldays when it was obviously a favourite then too. The earlier performances I've seen never, though, came up to the level of this one. I saw a version starring a very short Viola with an appallingly inappropriate halo of fluffy fair hair who looked totally ridiculous as a man and surely must have seemed to Orsino like a 12 year old page. One would hope Orsino wouldn't be falling for a child page!! And could you imagine this short actress in pageboy clothes and looking no more than a child being courted by the adult Olivia? Ridiculous... So it all made a nonsense of this story and when I tried to watch it again after seeing this version, I could only glance at a few scenes (with a very wet and soulful and completely pathetic Orsino mooning about) in horror and then return it hurriedly to the library. So this version has completely spoiled me for anything twee. I couldn't now accept a pretty diminutive Viola. She must be a sensible height to pass for a young man. Perhaps Viola has previously been played as a page rather than a young man being trained in warfare as in this movie but I think the best reading is that Viola is a strongwilled, adventurous young woman who wouldn't want the kind of conventional life Olivia has and with her brother lost seizes the opportunity to try out living a man's life with all the privileges that would bring in Shakespeare's time. So Imogen Stubbs with her beautiful but also strong features and height and perfect voice is ideal for this part. In the same way, Toby Stephens elevates Orsino from the dismal mooning character too often portrayed. Orsino can't be a wet dreamer. He's the leader of his country in war. He's highly respected and an upright person, made clear in the dialogue. His household is only of men and the indication in this play is that he runs a military academy which is surely exactly what we'd expect of a strong leader engaged in a war with a neighbouring state. Stephens is also extremely handsome, which adds plenty of spice to his character! The brother Sebastian, also excellently played and very charming, is amazingly like his twin in this production which is excellent. Of course we viewers can suspend belief when two actors are this much alike. Hard to imagine that in some productions both parts are played by one actress - this seems to me quite ridiculous nowadays although perfectly feasible in Shakespeare's time since women could not act on stage and the same boy could play both parts. Not allowing the twins to come face to face on stage would be completely bizarre. But I think that today this cannot work. We can't accept Viola played by a man. We can't accept Sebastian played by a girl. So better to suspend belief just a little! Sebastian's admirer Antonio is another splendid part excellently portrayed by Nicholas Farrell. Same applies to all the other actors. Sir Toby is portrayed with much wit but also some undertones of seriousness as he occasionally expresses his frustration at being a poor relation dependent on his niece's charity. Maria is not wasted as a silly bumpkin maid but given dignity and a little pathos. Malvolio becomes as I think he should a rather tragic figure, perfectly portrayed by Nigel Hawthorne especially in that "famous scene"! Sir Andrew is really sweet in his silly way. Helena Bonham Carter makes Olivia delightful and youthful, so suitable to fall for "Cesario. "Ben Kingsley rounds it off with a lovely sharp portrayal of Feste and lovely singing.

    A first-rate cast directed by Trevor Nunn, the premier Shakespeare interpreter of our era, makes this version of Twelfth Night a must-see for anyone who loves Shakespeare. The action appears to take place in the 18th or 19th century but the interpretation is otherwise straight-forward. While reduced from the Shakespearean original to a little over two hours, the script contains all of the essential elements. Nunn takes full advantage of the rugged setting to eliminate the proscenium and draws excellent performances from his cast of British-trained stars led by Helena Bonham Carter as Olivia, Imogen Stubbs as Viola (posing as Rosario), Ben Kingsley as Feste, the clown, Nigel Hawthorne as Malvolio, the proud steward, Mel Smith as Sir Toby Belch who combines with Maria, played by Imelda Stuanton, to reduce Malvolio to ridicule and tears. Viola and her twin brother, Sebastian (Steven MacIntosh), are matched in height and coloring but, as is invariably the case in Twelfth Night, it requires the audience to be blind to the fact that there is no way they could be mistaken for one another. "Suspension of disbelief" is what is required and anyone accustomed to Shakespeare's mistaken identities readily provides it. Sebastian, Viola's twin, has a lesser role, of course, but Steven McIntosh fills it nicely as does Nicholas Farrell as Antonio, who rescues Sebastion from the sea when the ship carrying the twins breaks apart, leading each to believe that the other is dead. The lone weak spot in the cast is Toby Stevens as Orsino, too weak a personality to inspire Viola's love (though his spurning as a suitor by Bonham Carter's Olivia is easy to understand). The plot leading up to Malvolio's fall is stylishly executed and his downfall, in Nigel Hawthorne's extraordinarily capable hands, nearly reaches the level of tragedy.

    In one of the DVD extras, a producer praises director Trevor Nunn as knowing more about Shakespeare than any man in England. (Not true, it's John Barton. But that's another story.) Unfortunately, Nunn attempts to demonstrate his erudition in this beautifully photographed, somewhat medicinal misfire. In an attempt to serve up Shakespeare to everyone, he's bogged himself down in self-conscious paralysis. Despite the beautiful images and the star-studded cast, this is an airless, spineless lump. Imogen Stubbs (Mrs. Nunn) is quite fine as Viola, and Richard E. Grant maintains great energy as Sir Andrew Aguecheek. Just about everybody else is sabotaged by a leaden pace and a heavy directorial hand. Nigel Hawthorne's Malvolio is destroyed by the glacial tempo, and Helena Bonham Carter's charm wilts at half speed. Mel Smith is beautifully cast as Sir Toby Belch, but is also just too darn slow. In a major miscalculation, Ben Kingsley's plays Feste as a menacing ex-con, perhaps Abel Magwitch strayed in from "Great Expectations." This is a Killer Klown from Kornwall. And in order to keep things this sluggish, at least a third of the text of the play is missing. It's the language that makes Shakespeare immortal, not the plots. Bad idea.... Oddly enough, in group scenes, actors often lose character, just standing around staring blankly at whoever is talking. You never see this in films, and you shouldn't. It should never happen. There is a 1969 ITV version circulating with Sir Alec Guinness as Malvolio and Sir Ralph Richardson as Sir Toby Belch to remind us of how far we haven't come. But best of all is the 1980 BBC DVD with Felicity Kendall, Sinead Cusack, Alec McCowen, Robert Hardy and Robert Lindsay. That "Twelfth Night" is an ensemble delight from beginning to end, with a full text and virtually flawless in engaging the play successfully on every level at once. Run, don't walk. It's a genuine treat.

    A lively, bubbly production of one of Shakespeare's more difficult plays. It's hard to know just what Shakespeare was getting at with this story. The text doesn't always seem to make sense. That's reflected in this, as well as any other, production. At times, one wonders what the expressions on characters' faces are meant to indicate. Just after Feste has fooled Malvolio with his imitation of the curate, for instance, Maria has a perturbed look on her face. As if the joke that she herself so elaborately designed now troubles her. There's nothing in the text to indicate that her expression should show remorse; and yet Sir Toby soon after says that he's sick of the whole thing. Why? That's one example of the difficulty of the text (which may have been corrupted over the centuries), and how it is manifested in this particular production's choices. I don't know why Sir Toby remarks at this point that he's sick of the joke, nor do I know whether Maria should share his feelings. Another difficulty is the role of Feste. Ben Kingsley fills this role, and because Ben Kingsley is a major star, he magnifies this character (in my opinion) out of all proportion. He becomes a sort of Zen master, pompous and oppressive. His jokes aren't funny (maybe we can't find Shakespeare's jokes funny today, but Kingsley's heavy delivery precludes humor), and his last confrontation with Malvolio comes off as a sort of thundering divine retribution. The entire play, the entire cast, stops dead and Feste takes over as if the whole point of the play has been his apotheosis at the expense of the degraded Malvolio. This surely cannot be what Shakespeare had in mind. Throughout the play he has a disconcerting habit of staring at other characters or the camera with what almost be described as a leer. Maybe Shakespeare would have sighed and commiserated with the producer of this film, because the clowns in his day were also big stars who demanded a lot of meat in their roles. The trouble is that there just isn't much meat in Feste's role according to the text, so we're stuck with leers and thundering retribution and other inventions. Shakespeare had to accommodate his clowns with ever-more important roles, climaxing with characters like Touchstone and Lear's fool. Kingsley is just inventing his own character. At times his work is interesting, but his weight in the production is, as I said, oppressive. Still, his screen time is relatively small, and much of the rest of the play is a joy, even if the point of the story isn't always clear. Bonham-Carter was never more alluring, Hawthorne is priceless as Malvolio (he was born for the role), and Smith and Grant are the perfect combination of Belch and Aguecheek. I suppose you might object that all four of them put their eyebrows to such prodigious use that their acting might be characterized as hamming. But I don't see how any of these characters can be played straight if the play is to work. One thing is for sure, no one would ever accuse this production of bogging down. The pace is lively, the sets and the cinematography are always striking, the score is invigorating, and I suspect that I could watch this film dubbed in Swahili and it would still be a lot of fun. Visually arresting is perhaps the best description.

    The Best Shakespeare Film - Ever!!!

    This film is absolutely awesome, I recommend everyone see it! The plot is fascinating and fast paced, it really keeps you guessing what's going to happen next. It's about two very similar twins, Viola and Sebsatian, who are caught in a ship wreck and each believe the other dead. Viola, for protection, dresses up as a boy and goes to work for a powerful Duke (a very dashing Toby Stephens). When the Duke sends his new "male" servant to woo his love, Lady Olivia (the glamorous Helena Bonham Carter), all sorts of chaos reigns, especially when Viola's now identically looking twin brother arrives!! The actors give it their all and make the complicated Shakespearian language much easier to follow. The scenery is the breathtakingly beautiful Cornish coast and the overall feel of the play is one that has been made with great care, yet never tires or becomes bogged down with the complicated language. I had no idea of the story before watching, but found this no obstacle, unlike many other Shakespeare film adaptions. I've never been much of a Shakespeare fan and have only read it when made to in school! After watching this film, however, I have been reading the play itself and have really enjoyed studying the original Shakespeare! There are so many different ideas and themes in the original play, all of which are brought effortlessly to life in the screen! The film also treads well the fine line the play expresses between tragedy and comedy. A brilliant treat of a film that is genuinely funny, heart warming and addicting! One of my all time favourite films I can't seem to stop watching!!!
