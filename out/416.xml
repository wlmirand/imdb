    I know that many people have a soft place in their heart for "Old Yeller". In fact, the country group Confederate Railroad even sang a song where they lament that they should have KNOWN a woman was no good because 'she didn't cry when Old Yeller died'...and I guess they wouldn't think much of me, either! I did NOT particularly enjoy "Old Yeller" for one very important reason--this Labrador was probably the meanest dog I've ever seen on film! It loved fighting with other animals and when Yeller got rabies and needed to be put down, it was the result of him attacking yet another animal! So, although Disney desperately wanted me to cry along with Yeller's owner at his passing, I just thought it was a blessing! If you DO want to see a film about a boy and his animal, may I suggest a different Disney film? I just saw "So Dear to My Heart" and loved it. It's about a young boy who raises a lamb--and the film is sweet throughout. In fact, this film debuted about a decade BEFORE "Old Yeller" and this later film is an obvious copy. See this other film--you'll see that it's dandy entertainment throughout...and the animal isn't a nasty killing machine!

    Old Yeller is a culture icon, a movie that has stood long and I believe plans to stay that long, as long as no one tries to remake it. Based on a Fred Gipson's 1956 children book of the same name, Old Yeller is about a man's best friend, a dog who was ready to do anything to protect his human family. The movie is somewhat an icon, it has found its way into the homes of many, even those who haven't seen the movie have heard about it, thanks to references in the ever popular F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV series, where Phoebe didn't know that Yeller died in the end (Sorry, Spoiler for all of you who haven't seen the movie yet) or it's reference in Justice League as Green Lantern/John Stewart's favorite movie. The movie features a good cast from the kids to the grown-ups everyone was just perfect; then I have to give Disney a good pat on the back for the dog training. It was just wonderful to see the dog's reactions and his behaviors showed that time went into the training of the dog. Even the child actor who played Arliss was good, he was impressive in his portrayal and I ended up loving him as his pocket never seemed to lack anything but fun. Yeller was a stray dog that happened to come into the life of the Coates family when their father, went out to search for work. His coming was welcomed by the youngest of the Coates, Arliss who always wanted a dog, but the eldest Travis was not so happy to have this new inclusion into the family and was ready to do anything to get Yeller out of the house. Travis changed his mind when one day he was in trouble and there was nobody around but Old Yeller to jump in and save him. (I'm purposely leaving out enough details so that you can enjoy the movie if you have not seen it yet) Walt Disney himself was the producer of this family hit, and it was well received by all who has seen it, the movie can be said to stand as one of the best films about a boy and his dog, although Walt Disney (the company) has tried many other dog and boy movies like Homeward Bound or Savage Sam, but none comes close to the kind of dramatic, adventure fun that Old Yeller delivers. The movie was well received as said and it brought in cash for Disney, so much so that the movie has been re-released, you will always find the DVD of Old Yeller available anywhere, so if like me you waited this long to see it, then maybe you should not wait any longer.

    This is what Disney did best in the 50's and early 60's with their live-action unit-no cynicism, no innuendo, just good family friendly storytelling with high production values and a moral. &nbsp;It is so refreshing to see this sort of movie, a true family movie, not just a 2 hour fart joke like so many kids movies are today. &nbsp;I watched this with my 9 year old daughter the other day, and, somewhat surprisingly, she remained completely engaged and enthralled throughout. &nbsp;I say surprised because so much of what is in the theater and on television for kids these days is just downright lazy, using flash, glitz, and breakneck pacing to distract from the rotten storytelling. &nbsp;Old Yeller, like most good stories, unfolds at a slower pace, but, because of the great storytelling, production, and acting, the payoff is not delayed, and the movie is satisfying throughout. &nbsp;It seems that today there is no true "family movie" category in cinema anymore, just sophomoric garbage for the kids, and empty violence, sex, and superficial titillation for everyone else. &nbsp;That is why it is so great to see movies like Old Yeller, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and other timeless live-action Disney family classics still getting some exposure.

    A boy brings a yellow dog home. The dog loves the family as much as they love him, but can the love last? I first saw this movie an extremely long time ago, and what did I think of it? I'll tell you. I thought that it was a masterpiece. But many years later, it's not a masterpiece, but a good movie. And it is a good movie, with a few flaws in it. What I mean is that there are flaws in this other wise perfect little film. I would have thought that this movie was perfect, but the last fifteen minutes were rather sad to watch. But other than that, I nevertheless thought that this movie was very good and entertaining. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece of a movie, nor would I call it one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen, but nevertheless, it is a very good movie that is worth watching. Old Yeller is a good old fashioned movie that is worth watching. When you watch this movie, you may end up feeling a little bit sad, because there are quite a few rather sad scenes in this film. I won't say anything about them, because it would most likely spoil the movie for you, and I don't want to do that. Could I watch this movie again if I had the chance, I probably would. I'm not saying that Old Yeller is a bad movie, it isn't a bad movie, but it just isn't one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen. On a scale from one to ten, with one being the worst and ten being the best, I will give this movie a rating of eight stars out of ten for being a movie that is not bad but has got a few flaws in it. For one of the very few times that I do so, I have to disagree with Leonard Maltin, this movie isn't one of the best. But don't get me wrong, I still like the movie. So all in all, Old Yeller is not one of the greatest movies ever made, but nevertheless, it is a good way to spend 83 minutes. But do I think that you should watch this movie? Yes I do. Who knows, when you watch this movie, you may think that it is one of the greatest movies that you have ever have seen, you may think that it is one of your all time favorite movies. For me, the main problem was the fact that this movie didn't age that good. I don't mean that it is outdated, but you can tell that it was made in the 1950's. Well anyway, this movie is not a masterpiece of a movie, but it is still a fun and very amusing movie to watch and enjoy, and that's what a movie is for, to watch and enjoy it. And when you watch this movie, you will probably enjoy it. 8/10

    I believe I first heard of this live action Disney movie from the 1950's late in my childhood (I was born nearly thirty years after this film's release), but never saw it until last year. I think it was late last summer when I first watched this adaptation of the "Old Yeller" novel by Fred Gipson, and from what I remember, I was impressed with a lot of it, but later on, I wasn't so sure anymore. I watched "The Shaggy Dog", another live action Disney dog movie from the 50's featuring Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran playing brothers, for the first time just this week. Shortly after watching that film and being fairly impressed with it, I have watched "Old Yeller" for the second time, and would say it was better for me than it was the first time, and also better than the other Disney dog movie I've mentioned, which I was expecting. In 1860's Texas, Jim Coates leaves his ranch to take part in a cattle drive, and won't be back for several months. On the ranch, he leaves behind his wife, Katie, and two sons Travis and Arliss. Travis, the older of the two brothers, is left to take his father's responsibilities. Shortly after his father leaves, Travis happens to be working outside when a stray yellow dog comes, scares the family mule, and makes it knock down the fence! Travis angrily chases this dog away, but the next day, he finds him back on the ranch already! Arliss has decided to adopt this dog, but after the trouble the mutt has already caused, Travis obviously doesn't want him around. However, the older Coates brother begins to have a change of heart when he discovers that the meat he left out overnight has surprisingly not been touched by the dog. It soon turns out that "Old Yeller" is a big help for Travis as he takes on the responsibilities of his absent father, and the two develop a strong bond, but there is some trouble ahead. This movie has a small cast, but most of the few who had roles in it put on decent performances, even if some are slightly flawed. Dorothy McGuire and Fess Parker as the Coates parents, Tommy Kirk as Travis (one of his many Disney roles), and actor/athlete Chuck Connors in the smaller role of Burn Sanderson, are all notable cast performances. On the other hand, I did not care much for Jeff York as the lazy, fast-talking Bud Searcy, or Beverly Washburn as Bud's daughter, Lisbeth, and when these two characters first appear, I've found that they may temporarily bring the entertainment value down a bit, but fortunately, they aren't usually a problem. For the most part, the plot is an intriguing one, with what Travis and Old Yeller go through together and the boy's initial reaction to the dog followed by the strong bond they develop. Obviously, SO many others have pointed this out, but parts of the film certainly are emotional as well, which also helps keep it from being underwhelming and forgettable. They also picked some nice, scenic filming locations for this particular live action Disney film. I'm sure many people through the generations have seen this movie in their childhood, but I didn't, so I obviously don't know what that's like. This certainly isn't the happiest movie a kid could watch, but its reputation shows that it clearly has pleased many of those who saw it as kids, so I guess it has succeeded with that goal as the decades have gone by, and likely continues to do so today. Many adults like this "Old Yeller" adaptation as well, which I can understand after seeing it myself. In my opinion, there are some weaker parts of the film, so I can't rate it as highly as some voters, but overall, it's a solid effort that has aged well. If you haven't seen this successful 1957 Disney animal movie, I will say that should you do decide to watch it, some parts could make you cry if you're an emotional kind of person, or maybe even if you're not that emotional (though I didn't cry), but this is a major reason why it's so widely remembered and praised.

    In 1860s Texas, a youngster must act as man of the house when his rancher-father joins a three-month-long cattle drive; he and his ever-patient, ever-smiling mother take in a lovable stray dog who saves his little brother from a bear, and all grow attached to the mongrel even as a strain of hydrophobia spreads throughout the wildlife. Simple, episodic frontier tale given the Walt Disney touch: lots of cute, heart-tugging sentiment, plus a prescient 'circle of life' message at the end. Tommy Kirk gives arguably his best juvenile performance here, and mom Dorothy McGuire beams commendably without lapsing into syrupy goodness. The gorgeous color photography, the warm family narrative, and a jaunty title song all conspired to make the picture a box-office winner, but the main reason it's called a Disney Classic today is because of that dog. Disney did many things right, one of which was picking the very best animal actors for his live-action comedies and adventures. This lop-eared hound is a beauty to behold, and should enchant even non-dog lovers! **1/2 from ****

    'Old Yeller' is a captivating drama, one of the finest live-action achievements from Disney. Its story is simple, jolly and at the same time sentimental, although the ending is devastating. Not all 'doggy' movies are great. This one is. Expert dog training is notorious, as well as the dog's intelligence. The dog Spike was a superb animal actor and, according to Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran, he was just like his "Old Yeller" character in everything. Of course, the dog's name isn't really "Old Yeller". He's just "Yeller". Like Arliss says, &laquo;He's not an ugly yeller dog! He's a pretty yeller dog!&raquo;. And a very sympathetic one, says I. He's definitely the best Doggone Dog in the West :) Tommy Kirk, Kevin Corcoran, Fess Parker, Dorothy McGuire, Jeff York, Chuck Connors and Beverly Washburn are all fine in their roles. There are few characters (and actors), which isn't the most common thing but works out fine for this film. Burn Sanderson is one of the most interesting: he is a cool chap, like a gentle giant. Bud Searcy is more like an anecdote and hopelessly lazy and boring but still hilarious. However, I think Travis and Katie are harsh on Arliss at times and they don't always give him proper explanations when he's asking a question. Plus, it bothers me a bit that Travis is always the one having the dogs for himself. Katie says that Travis had a dog when he was a child but Arliss didn't. For the 1st time, Arliss gets a dog - Yeller. Travis is a selfish douche towards Yeller at first. He changes a lot, which I think it's very well. But then it's as if he considers the dog as only his. One of Yeller's puppies was gonna be for Travis, but he didn't care so the puppy went for Arliss. Later, Travis apparently claims the puppy as only his. So, it's only the big brother who wins everything for him? What about the little brother? Nevertheless, these details don't interfere significantly in what is a fine movie. The soundtrack is dated but its charm remains intact. The wonderful settings of a very old Texas also help a lot to make this a great film. Title in Portugal: 'O Rapaz e o C&atilde;o'.

    Before I saw Old Yeller, I gave that distinction to the equally wonderful Lassie Come Home. After seeing Old Yeller, I think I have found the ultimate dog movie. Old Yeller for me does for dogs like The Three Lives of Thomasina does for cats and The Red Shoes does for dancing. In short, this film is a classic. It has beautiful cinematography and scenery. It has a beautiful story, and a truly affecting scene that anybody who's seen the movie will know what I'm talking about. It has a wonderfully-trained and adorable dog. It has some nice writing, and a pleasant score, as well as some fine direction and an excellent turn from Dorothy McGuire. I personally liked Kevin Cocoran and Tommy Kirk here, and much preferred them here than I did in Swiss Family Robinson. I didn't mind them then either, but they are more appealing and their characters are more likable in Old Yeller. In conclusion, a classic, moving, sweet and above all beautiful. Not to be missed! 10/10 Bethany Cox

    "Old Yeller" is a prime example of a movie that goes for a sentimental approach but does not overstep itself and condescend into becoming schmaltzy. Sure, most everybody can identify and get involved of the tale about a boy and his dog, but the filmmakers and script-writers have to be conscious enough about what they are doing to pull it off. "Old Yeller" is not a movie that bends down on its knees and pleads for you to like it. It just plays it straight and sweetly and gets the exact effect it wants out of you. In the movie, young but world-conscious Travis Coates (Tommy Kirk) is sad about the passing-away of his previous dog and unwillingly comes upon another companion when a golden retriever comes a-bounding into his life. Travis is initially skeptical of this dog, but is forced to adapt to him when his younger brother wants to adopt him. However, as time goes on, Travis himself becomes more and more attached to the retriever than his brother. And he forms not merely a friendship, but a partnership with this lovable canine, whom he names Old Yeller. There have been many boy-and-dog (or substitute "dog" for any other animal) stories over the years, trying to be "Old Yeller." Some have accomplished it like that wonderful 2000 movie "My Dog Skip." But this incredibly sentimental and heart-warming tale has immortalized itself with its ways of getting the audience involved. I'd be even as daring to say that people who did not growing up with a dog will be undoubtedly moved by this story unless they are a moral-devoid curmudgeon. I won't give away the ending of the movie because of the Internet Movie Database's guidelines, even though I think we all know the way this movie culminates. There's a saying going around that if you did not cry at the end of "Old Yeller" you are either hopelessly lacking a heart or a lousy hypocrite. I mean, how can your heartstrings not be pulled at by the way this movie culminates? Please keep in mind that this review is coming from a 19-year-old college student who re-watched the movie in his early years as an adult, not somebody simply reminiscing about cinema experiences of the past. "Old Yeller" aims for sympathy and it gets it. But it does not overplay its motives and storytelling techniques to the point where it becomes schmaltzy and unpleasantly over-sweet. From my personal experience, after having watched "Old Yeller" for the first time since sixth grade, I wanted nothing more than to walk up to my own dog and embrace him lovingly, which I did. Some movies are influential because of a revolutionary factor. Pictures like this work because they tread upon familiar ground, but do it right. "Old Yeller" is one of the best doggone dog movies in the West, East, North, and South. It's a wonderful little tale.

    In Old yeller, Travis (tommy kirk) is left alone with his ma (Dororthy McGuire) and little brother arliss (Kevin Cocoran) after his pa is off to sell cattle for money, so the family can get through the winter. so while he's gone for 3 months, he has to work like a man to get things done. along the way, he finds a dog. while initially he dislikes the dog for ruining his life, He comes to liking the dog. soon the two of them become inseparable. but will the Problems they face, such as the dog's original owner (played by the awesome chuck Connors) and an incurable contagious disease, tear them apart? I cannot stress this enough, Old Disney is, and will forever be better than the new Disney. It's movies like old yeller that will never be made again without heavy censorship. They would water down the hog attack scene. they would water down the ending. they would water down everything possible. But here's an original piece of work from Disney, and it's well worth buying on DVD or VHS, however you can find it.

I won't say anything about them, because it would most likely spoil the movie for you, and I don't want to do that. Could I watch this movie again if I had the chance, I probably would. I'm not saying that Old Yeller is a bad movie, it isn't a bad movie, but it just isn't one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen. On a scale from one to ten, with one being the worst and ten being the best, I will give this movie a rating of eight stars out of ten for being a movie that is not bad but has got a few flaws in it. For one of the very few times that I do so, I have to disagree with Leonard Maltin, this movie isn't one of the best. But don't get me wrong, I still like the movie. So all in all, Old Yeller is not one of the greatest movies ever made, but nevertheless, it is a good way to spend 83 minutes. But do I think that you should watch this movie? Yes I do. Who knows, when you watch this movie, you may think that it is one of the greatest movies that you have ever have seen, you may think that it is one of your all time favorite movies. For me, the main problem was the fact that this movie didn't age that good. I don't mean that it is outdated, but you can tell that it was made in the 1950's. Well anyway, this movie is not a masterpiece of a movie, but it is still a fun and very amusing movie to watch and enjoy, and that's what a movie is for, to watch and enjoy it. And when you watch this movie, you will probably enjoy it. 8/10

    I believe I first heard of this live action Disney movie from the 1950's late in my childhood (I was born nearly thirty years after this film's release), but never saw it until last year. I think it was late last summer when I first watched this adaptation of the "Old Yeller" novel by Fred Gipson, and from what I remember, I was impressed with a lot of it, but later on, I wasn't so sure anymore. I watched "The Shaggy Dog", another live action Disney dog movie from the 50's featuring Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran playing brothers, for the first time just this week. Shortly after watching that film and being fairly impressed with it, I have watched "Old Yeller" for the second time, and would say it was better for me than it was the first time, and also better than the other Disney dog movie I've mentioned, which I was expecting. In 1860's Texas, Jim Coates leaves his ranch to take part in a cattle drive, and won't be back for several months. On the ranch, he leaves behind his wife, Katie, and two sons Travis and Arliss. Travis, the older of the two brothers, is left to take his father's responsibilities. Shortly after his father leaves, Travis happens to be working outside when a stray yellow dog comes, scares the family mule, and makes it knock down the fence! Travis angrily chases this dog away, but the next day, he finds him back on the ranch already! Arliss has decided to adopt this dog, but after the trouble the mutt has already caused, Travis obviously doesn't want him around. However, the older Coates brother begins to have a change of heart when he discovers that the meat he left out overnight has surprisingly not been touched by the dog. It soon turns out that "Old Yeller" is a big help for Travis as he takes on the responsibilities of his absent father, and the two develop a strong bond, but there is some trouble ahead. This movie has a small cast, but most of the few who had roles in it put on decent performances, even if some are slightly flawed. Dorothy McGuire and Fess Parker as the Coates parents, Tommy Kirk as Travis (one of his many Disney roles), and actor/athlete Chuck Connors in the smaller role of Burn Sanderson, are all notable cast performances. On the other hand, I did not care much for Jeff York as the lazy, fast-talking Bud Searcy, or Beverly Washburn as Bud's daughter, Lisbeth, and when these two characters first appear, I've found that they may temporarily bring the entertainment value down a bit, but fortunately, they aren't usually a problem. For the most part, the plot is an intriguing one, with what Travis and Old Yeller go through together and the boy's initial reaction to the dog followed by the strong bond they develop. Obviously, SO many others have pointed this out, but parts of the film certainly are emotional as well, which also helps keep it from being underwhelming and forgettable. They also picked some nice, scenic filming locations for this particular live action Disney film. I'm sure many people through the generations have seen this movie in their childhood, but I didn't, so I obviously don't know what that's like. This certainly isn't the happiest movie a kid could watch, but its reputation shows that it clearly has pleased many of those who saw it as kids, so I guess it has succeeded with that goal as the decades have gone by, and likely continues to do so today. Many adults like this "Old Yeller" adaptation as well, which I can understand after seeing it myself. In my opinion, there are some weaker parts of the film, so I can't rate it as highly as some voters, but overall, it's a solid effort that has aged well. If you haven't seen this successful 1957 Disney animal movie, I will say that should you do decide to watch it, some parts could make you cry if you're an emotional kind of person, or maybe even if you're not that emotional (though I didn't cry), but this is a major reason why it's so widely remembered and praised.

    In 1860s Texas, a youngster must act as man of the house when his rancher-father joins a three-month-long cattle drive; he and his ever-patient, ever-smiling mother take in a lovable stray dog who saves his little brother from a bear, and all grow attached to the mongrel even as a strain of hydrophobia spreads throughout the wildlife. Simple, episodic frontier tale given the Walt Disney touch: lots of cute, heart-tugging sentiment, plus a prescient 'circle of life' message at the end. Tommy Kirk gives arguably his best juvenile performance here, and mom Dorothy McGuire beams commendably without lapsing into syrupy goodness. The gorgeous color photography, the warm family narrative, and a jaunty title song all conspired to make the picture a box-office winner, but the main reason it's called a Disney Classic today is because of that dog.

    'Old Yeller' is a captivating drama, one of the finest live-action achievements from Disney. Its story is simple, jolly and at the same time sentimental, although the ending is devastating. Not all 'doggy' movies are great. This one is. Expert dog training is notorious, as well as the dog's intelligence. The dog Spike was a superb animal actor and, according to Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran, he was just like his "Old Yeller" character in everything. Of course, the dog's name isn't really "Old Yeller". He's just "Yeller". Like Arliss says, &laquo;He's not an ugly yeller dog! He's a pretty yeller dog!&raquo;. And a very sympathetic one, says I. He's definitely the best Doggone Dog in the West :) Tommy Kirk, Kevin Corcoran, Fess Parker, Dorothy McGuire, Jeff York, Chuck Connors and Beverly Washburn are all fine in their roles. There are few characters (and actors), which isn't the most common thing but works out fine for this film. Burn Sanderson is one of the most interesting: he is a cool chap, like a gentle giant. Bud Searcy is more like an anecdote and hopelessly lazy and boring but still hilarious. However, I think Travis and Katie are harsh on Arliss at times and they don't always give him proper explanations when he's asking a question. Plus, it bothers me a bit that Travis is always the one having the dogs for himself. Katie says that Travis had a dog when he was a child but Arliss didn't. For the 1st time, Arliss gets a dog - Yeller. Travis is a selfish douche towards Yeller at first. He changes a lot, which I think it's very well. But then it's as if he considers the dog as only his. One of Yeller's puppies was gonna be for Travis, but he didn't care so the puppy went for Arliss. Later, Travis apparently claims the puppy as only his. So, it's only the big brother who wins everything for him? What about the little brother? Nevertheless, these details don't interfere significantly in what is a fine movie. The soundtrack is dated but its charm remains intact. The wonderful settings of a very old Texas also help a lot to make this a great film. Title in Portugal: 'O Rapaz e o C&atilde;o'.

    Before I saw Old Yeller, I gave that distinction to the equally wonderful Lassie Come Home. After seeing Old Yeller, I think I have found the ultimate dog movie. Old Yeller for me does for dogs like The Three Lives of Thomasina does for cats and The Red Shoes does for dancing. In short, this film is a classic. It has beautiful cinematography and scenery. It has a beautiful story, and a truly affecting scene that anybody who's seen the movie will know what I'm talking about. It has a wonderfully-trained and adorable dog. It has some nice writing, and a pleasant score, as well as some fine direction and an excellent turn from Dorothy McGuire. I personally liked Kevin Cocoran and Tommy Kirk here, and much preferred them here than I did in Swiss Family Robinson. I didn't mind them then either, but they are more appealing and their characters are more likable in Old Yeller. In conclusion, a classic, moving, sweet and above all beautiful. Not to be missed! 10/10 Bethany Cox

    "Old Yeller" is a prime example of a movie that goes for a sentimental approach but does not overstep itself and condescend into becoming schmaltzy. Sure, most everybody can identify and get involved of the tale about a boy and his dog, but the filmmakers and script-writers have to be conscious enough about what they are doing to pull it off. "Old Yeller" is not a movie that bends down on its knees and pleads for you to like it. It just plays it straight and sweetly and gets the exact effect it wants out of you. In the movie, young but world-conscious Travis Coates (Tommy Kirk) is sad about the passing-away of his previous dog and unwillingly comes upon another companion when a golden retriever comes a-bounding into his life. Travis is initially skeptical of this dog, but is forced to adapt to him when his younger brother wants to adopt him. However, as time goes on, Travis himself becomes more and more attached to the retriever than his brother. And he forms not merely a friendship, but a partnership with this lovable canine, whom he names Old Yeller. There have been many boy-and-dog (or substitute "dog" for any other animal) stories over the years, trying to be "Old Yeller." Some have accomplished it like that wonderful 2000 movie "My Dog Skip." But this incredibly sentimental and heart-warming tale has immortalized itself with its ways of getting the audience involved. I'd be even as daring to say that people who did not growing up with a dog will be undoubtedly moved by this story unless they are a moral-devoid curmudgeon. I won't give away the ending of the movie because of the Internet Movie Database's guidelines, even though I think we all know the way this movie culminates. There's a saying going around that if you did not cry at the end of "Old Yeller" you are either hopelessly lacking a heart or a lousy hypocrite. I mean, how can your heartstrings not be pulled at by the way this movie culminates? Please keep in mind that this review is coming from a 19-year-old college student who re-watched the movie in his early years as an adult, not somebody simply reminiscing about cinema experiences of the past. "Old Yeller" aims for sympathy and it gets it. But it does not overplay its motives and storytelling techniques to the point where it becomes schmaltzy and unpleasantly over-sweet. From my personal experience, after having watched "Old Yeller" for the first time since sixth grade, I wanted nothing more than to walk up to my own dog and embrace him lovingly, which I did. Some movies are influential because of a revolutionary factor. Pictures like this work because they tread upon familiar ground, but do it right. "Old Yeller" is one of the best doggone dog movies in the West, East, North, and South. It's a wonderful little tale.

    In Old yeller, Travis (tommy kirk) is left alone with his ma (Dororthy McGuire) and little brother arliss (Kevin Cocoran) after his pa is off to sell cattle for money, so the family can get through the winter. so while he's gone for 3 months, he has to work like a man to get things done. along the way, he finds a dog. while initially he dislikes the dog for ruining his life, He comes to liking the dog. soon the two of them become inseparable. but will the Problems they face, such as the dog's original owner (played by the awesome chuck Connors) and an incurable contagious disease, tear them apart? I cannot stress this enough, Old Disney is, and will forever be better than the new Disney. It's movies like old yeller that will never be made again without heavy censorship. They would water down the hog attack scene. they would water down the ending. they would water down everything possible. But here's an original piece of work from Disney, and it's well worth buying on DVD or VHS, however you can find it.

    I know that many people have a soft place in their heart for "Old Yeller". In fact, the country group Confederate Railroad even sang a song where they lament that they should have KNOWN a woman was no good because 'she didn't cry when Old Yeller died'...and I guess they wouldn't think much of me, either! I did NOT particularly enjoy "Old Yeller" for one very important reason--this Labrador was probably the meanest dog I've ever seen on film! It loved fighting with other animals and when Yeller got rabies and needed to be put down, it was the result of him attacking yet another animal! So, although Disney desperately wanted me to cry along with Yeller's owner at his passing, I just thought it was a blessing! If you DO want to see a film about a boy and his animal, may I suggest a different Disney film? I just saw "So Dear to My Heart" and loved it. It's about a young boy who raises a lamb--and the film is sweet throughout. In fact, this film debuted about a decade BEFORE "Old Yeller" and this later film is an obvious copy. See this other film--you'll see that it's dandy entertainment throughout...and the animal isn't a nasty killing machine!

    Old Yeller is a culture icon, a movie that has stood long and I believe plans to stay that long, as long as no one tries to remake it. Based on a Fred Gipson's 1956 children book of the same name, Old Yeller is about a man's best friend, a dog who was ready to do anything to protect his human family. The movie is somewhat an icon, it has found its way into the homes of many, even those who haven't seen the movie have heard about it, thanks to references in the ever popular F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV series, where Phoebe didn't know that Yeller died in the end (Sorry, Spoiler for all of you who haven't seen the movie yet) or it's reference in Justice League as Green Lantern/John Stewart's favorite movie. The movie features a good cast from the kids to the grown-ups everyone was just perfect; then I have to give Disney a good pat on the back for the dog training. It was just wonderful to see the dog's reactions and his behaviors showed that time went into the training of the dog. Even the child actor who played Arliss was good, he was impressive in his portrayal and I ended up loving him as his pocket never seemed to lack anything but fun. Yeller was a stray dog that happened to come into the life of the Coates family when their father, went out to search for work. His coming was welcomed by the youngest of the Coates, Arliss who always wanted a dog, but the eldest Travis was not so happy to have this new inclusion into the family and was ready to do anything to get Yeller out of the house. Travis changed his mind when one day he was in trouble and there was nobody around but Old Yeller to jump in and save him. (I'm purposely leaving out enough details so that you can enjoy the movie if you have not seen it yet) Walt Disney himself was the producer of this family hit, and it was well received by all who has seen it, the movie can be said to stand as one of the best films about a boy and his dog, although Walt Disney (the company) has tried many other dog and boy movies like Homeward Bound or Savage Sam, but none comes close to the kind of dramatic, adventure fun that Old Yeller delivers. The movie was well received as said and it brought in cash for Disney, so much so that the movie has been re-released, you will always find the DVD of Old Yeller available anywhere, so if like me you waited this long to see it, then maybe you should not wait any longer.

    This is what Disney did best in the 50's and early 60's with their live-action unit-no cynicism, no innuendo, just good family friendly storytelling with high production values and a moral. &nbsp;It is so refreshing to see this sort of movie, a true family movie, not just a 2 hour fart joke like so many kids movies are today. &nbsp;I watched this with my 9 year old daughter the other day, and, somewhat surprisingly, she remained completely engaged and enthralled throughout. &nbsp;I say surprised because so much of what is in the theater and on television for kids these days is just downright lazy, using flash, glitz, and breakneck pacing to distract from the rotten storytelling. &nbsp;Old Yeller, like most good stories, unfolds at a slower pace, but, because of the great storytelling, production, and acting, the payoff is not delayed, and the movie is satisfying throughout. &nbsp;It seems that today there is no true "family movie" category in cinema anymore, just sophomoric garbage for the kids, and empty violence, sex, and superficial titillation for everyone else. &nbsp;That is why it is so great to see movies like Old Yeller, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and other timeless live-action Disney family classics still getting some exposure.

    A boy brings a yellow dog home. The dog loves the family as much as they love him, but can the love last? I first saw this movie an extremely long time ago, and what did I think of it? I'll tell you. I thought that it was a masterpiece. But many years later, it's not a masterpiece, but a good movie. And it is a good movie, with a few flaws in it. What I mean is that there are flaws in this other wise perfect little film. I would have thought that this movie was perfect, but the last fifteen minutes were rather sad to watch. But other than that, I nevertheless thought that this movie was very good and entertaining. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece of a movie, nor would I call it one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen, but nevertheless, it is a very good movie that is worth watching. Old Yeller is a good old fashioned movie that is worth watching. When you watch this movie, you may end up feeling a little bit sad, because there are quite a few rather sad scenes in this film.

I'm not saying that Old Yeller is a bad movie, it isn't a bad movie, but it just isn't one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen. On a scale from one to ten, with one being the worst and ten being the best, I will give this movie a rating of eight stars out of ten for being a movie that is not bad but has got a few flaws in it. For one of the very few times that I do so, I have to disagree with Leonard Maltin, this movie isn't one of the best. But don't get me wrong, I still like the movie. So all in all, Old Yeller is not one of the greatest movies ever made, but nevertheless, it is a good way to spend 83 minutes. But do I think that you should watch this movie? Yes I do.

For the 1st time, Arliss gets a dog - Yeller. Travis is a selfish douche towards Yeller at first. He changes a lot, which I think it's very well. But then it's as if he considers the dog as only his. One of Yeller's puppies was gonna be for Travis, but he didn't care so the puppy went for Arliss. Later, Travis apparently claims the puppy as only his. So, it's only the big brother who wins everything for him? What about the little brother? Nevertheless, these details don't interfere significantly in what is a fine movie. The soundtrack is dated but its charm remains intact. The wonderful settings of a very old Texas also help a lot to make this a great film. Title in Portugal: 'O Rapaz e o C&atilde;o'.

    Before I saw Old Yeller, I gave that distinction to the equally wonderful Lassie Come Home. After seeing Old Yeller, I think I have found the ultimate dog movie. Old Yeller for me does for dogs like The Three Lives of Thomasina does for cats and The Red Shoes does for dancing. In short, this film is a classic. It has beautiful cinematography and scenery. It has a beautiful story, and a truly affecting scene that anybody who's seen the movie will know what I'm talking about. It has a wonderfully-trained and adorable dog. It has some nice writing, and a pleasant score, as well as some fine direction and an excellent turn from Dorothy McGuire. I personally liked Kevin Cocoran and Tommy Kirk here, and much preferred them here than I did in Swiss Family Robinson. I didn't mind them then either, but they are more appealing and their characters are more likable in Old Yeller. In conclusion, a classic, moving, sweet and above all beautiful. Not to be missed! 10/10 Bethany Cox

    "Old Yeller" is a prime example of a movie that goes for a sentimental approach but does not overstep itself and condescend into becoming schmaltzy. Sure, most everybody can identify and get involved of the tale about a boy and his dog, but the filmmakers and script-writers have to be conscious enough about what they are doing to pull it off. "Old Yeller" is not a movie that bends down on its knees and pleads for you to like it. It just plays it straight and sweetly and gets the exact effect it wants out of you. In the movie, young but world-conscious Travis Coates (Tommy Kirk) is sad about the passing-away of his previous dog and unwillingly comes upon another companion when a golden retriever comes a-bounding into his life. Travis is initially skeptical of this dog, but is forced to adapt to him when his younger brother wants to adopt him. However, as time goes on, Travis himself becomes more and more attached to the retriever than his brother. And he forms not merely a friendship, but a partnership with this lovable canine, whom he names Old Yeller. There have been many boy-and-dog (or substitute "dog" for any other animal) stories over the years, trying to be "Old Yeller." Some have accomplished it like that wonderful 2000 movie "My Dog Skip." But this incredibly sentimental and heart-warming tale has immortalized itself with its ways of getting the audience involved. I'd be even as daring to say that people who did not growing up with a dog will be undoubtedly moved by this story unless they are a moral-devoid curmudgeon. I won't give away the ending of the movie because of the Internet Movie Database's guidelines, even though I think we all know the way this movie culminates. There's a saying going around that if you did not cry at the end of "Old Yeller" you are either hopelessly lacking a heart or a lousy hypocrite. I mean, how can your heartstrings not be pulled at by the way this movie culminates? Please keep in mind that this review is coming from a 19-year-old college student who re-watched the movie in his early years as an adult, not somebody simply reminiscing about cinema experiences of the past. "Old Yeller" aims for sympathy and it gets it. But it does not overplay its motives and storytelling techniques to the point where it becomes schmaltzy and unpleasantly over-sweet. From my personal experience, after having watched "Old Yeller" for the first time since sixth grade, I wanted nothing more than to walk up to my own dog and embrace him lovingly, which I did. Some movies are influential because of a revolutionary factor. Pictures like this work because they tread upon familiar ground, but do it right. "Old Yeller" is one of the best doggone dog movies in the West, East, North, and South. It's a wonderful little tale.

    In Old yeller, Travis (tommy kirk) is left alone with his ma (Dororthy McGuire) and little brother arliss (Kevin Cocoran) after his pa is off to sell cattle for money, so the family can get through the winter. so while he's gone for 3 months, he has to work like a man to get things done. along the way, he finds a dog. while initially he dislikes the dog for ruining his life, He comes to liking the dog. soon the two of them become inseparable. but will the Problems they face, such as the dog's original owner (played by the awesome chuck Connors) and an incurable contagious disease, tear them apart? I cannot stress this enough, Old Disney is, and will forever be better than the new Disney. It's movies like old yeller that will never be made again without heavy censorship. They would water down the hog attack scene. they would water down the ending. they would water down everything possible. But here's an original piece of work from Disney, and it's well worth buying on DVD or VHS, however you can find it.

    I know that many people have a soft place in their heart for "Old Yeller". In fact, the country group Confederate Railroad even sang a song where they lament that they should have KNOWN a woman was no good because 'she didn't cry when Old Yeller died'...and I guess they wouldn't think much of me, either! I did NOT particularly enjoy "Old Yeller" for one very important reason--this Labrador was probably the meanest dog I've ever seen on film! It loved fighting with other animals and when Yeller got rabies and needed to be put down, it was the result of him attacking yet another animal! So, although Disney desperately wanted me to cry along with Yeller's owner at his passing, I just thought it was a blessing! If you DO want to see a film about a boy and his animal, may I suggest a different Disney film? I just saw "So Dear to My Heart" and loved it. It's about a young boy who raises a lamb--and the film is sweet throughout. In fact, this film debuted about a decade BEFORE "Old Yeller" and this later film is an obvious copy. See this other film--you'll see that it's dandy entertainment throughout...and the animal isn't a nasty killing machine!

    Old Yeller is a culture icon, a movie that has stood long and I believe plans to stay that long, as long as no one tries to remake it. Based on a Fred Gipson's 1956 children book of the same name, Old Yeller is about a man's best friend, a dog who was ready to do anything to protect his human family. The movie is somewhat an icon, it has found its way into the homes of many, even those who haven't seen the movie have heard about it, thanks to references in the ever popular F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV series, where Phoebe didn't know that Yeller died in the end (Sorry, Spoiler for all of you who haven't seen the movie yet) or it's reference in Justice League as Green Lantern/John Stewart's favorite movie. The movie features a good cast from the kids to the grown-ups everyone was just perfect; then I have to give Disney a good pat on the back for the dog training. It was just wonderful to see the dog's reactions and his behaviors showed that time went into the training of the dog. Even the child actor who played Arliss was good, he was impressive in his portrayal and I ended up loving him as his pocket never seemed to lack anything but fun. Yeller was a stray dog that happened to come into the life of the Coates family when their father, went out to search for work. His coming was welcomed by the youngest of the Coates, Arliss who always wanted a dog, but the eldest Travis was not so happy to have this new inclusion into the family and was ready to do anything to get Yeller out of the house. Travis changed his mind when one day he was in trouble and there was nobody around but Old Yeller to jump in and save him. (I'm purposely leaving out enough details so that you can enjoy the movie if you have not seen it yet) Walt Disney himself was the producer of this family hit, and it was well received by all who has seen it, the movie can be said to stand as one of the best films about a boy and his dog, although Walt Disney (the company) has tried many other dog and boy movies like Homeward Bound or Savage Sam, but none comes close to the kind of dramatic, adventure fun that Old Yeller delivers. The movie was well received as said and it brought in cash for Disney, so much so that the movie has been re-released, you will always find the DVD of Old Yeller available anywhere, so if like me you waited this long to see it, then maybe you should not wait any longer.

    This is what Disney did best in the 50's and early 60's with their live-action unit-no cynicism, no innuendo, just good family friendly storytelling with high production values and a moral. &nbsp;It is so refreshing to see this sort of movie, a true family movie, not just a 2 hour fart joke like so many kids movies are today. &nbsp;I watched this with my 9 year old daughter the other day, and, somewhat surprisingly, she remained completely engaged and enthralled throughout. &nbsp;I say surprised because so much of what is in the theater and on television for kids these days is just downright lazy, using flash, glitz, and breakneck pacing to distract from the rotten storytelling. &nbsp;Old Yeller, like most good stories, unfolds at a slower pace, but, because of the great storytelling, production, and acting, the payoff is not delayed, and the movie is satisfying throughout. &nbsp;It seems that today there is no true "family movie" category in cinema anymore, just sophomoric garbage for the kids, and empty violence, sex, and superficial titillation for everyone else. &nbsp;That is why it is so great to see movies like Old Yeller, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and other timeless live-action Disney family classics still getting some exposure.

    A boy brings a yellow dog home. The dog loves the family as much as they love him, but can the love last? I first saw this movie an extremely long time ago, and what did I think of it? I'll tell you. I thought that it was a masterpiece. But many years later, it's not a masterpiece, but a good movie. And it is a good movie, with a few flaws in it. What I mean is that there are flaws in this other wise perfect little film. I would have thought that this movie was perfect, but the last fifteen minutes were rather sad to watch. But other than that, I nevertheless thought that this movie was very good and entertaining. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece of a movie, nor would I call it one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen, but nevertheless, it is a very good movie that is worth watching. Old Yeller is a good old fashioned movie that is worth watching. When you watch this movie, you may end up feeling a little bit sad, because there are quite a few rather sad scenes in this film. I won't say anything about them, because it would most likely spoil the movie for you, and I don't want to do that. Could I watch this movie again if I had the chance, I probably would. I'm not saying that Old Yeller is a bad movie, it isn't a bad movie, but it just isn't one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen. On a scale from one to ten, with one being the worst and ten being the best, I will give this movie a rating of eight stars out of ten for being a movie that is not bad but has got a few flaws in it. For one of the very few times that I do so, I have to disagree with Leonard Maltin, this movie isn't one of the best. But don't get me wrong, I still like the movie. So all in all, Old Yeller is not one of the greatest movies ever made, but nevertheless, it is a good way to spend 83 minutes. But do I think that you should watch this movie? Yes I do. Who knows, when you watch this movie, you may think that it is one of the greatest movies that you have ever have seen, you may think that it is one of your all time favorite movies. For me, the main problem was the fact that this movie didn't age that good. I don't mean that it is outdated, but you can tell that it was made in the 1950's. Well anyway, this movie is not a masterpiece of a movie, but it is still a fun and very amusing movie to watch and enjoy, and that's what a movie is for, to watch and enjoy it. And when you watch this movie, you will probably enjoy it. 8/10

    I believe I first heard of this live action Disney movie from the 1950's late in my childhood (I was born nearly thirty years after this film's release), but never saw it until last year. I think it was late last summer when I first watched this adaptation of the "Old Yeller" novel by Fred Gipson, and from what I remember, I was impressed with a lot of it, but later on, I wasn't so sure anymore. I watched "The Shaggy Dog", another live action Disney dog movie from the 50's featuring Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran playing brothers, for the first time just this week. Shortly after watching that film and being fairly impressed with it, I have watched "Old Yeller" for the second time, and would say it was better for me than it was the first time, and also better than the other Disney dog movie I've mentioned, which I was expecting. In 1860's Texas, Jim Coates leaves his ranch to take part in a cattle drive, and won't be back for several months. On the ranch, he leaves behind his wife, Katie, and two sons Travis and Arliss. Travis, the older of the two brothers, is left to take his father's responsibilities. Shortly after his father leaves, Travis happens to be working outside when a stray yellow dog comes, scares the family mule, and makes it knock down the fence! Travis angrily chases this dog away, but the next day, he finds him back on the ranch already! Arliss has decided to adopt this dog, but after the trouble the mutt has already caused, Travis obviously doesn't want him around. However, the older Coates brother begins to have a change of heart when he discovers that the meat he left out overnight has surprisingly not been touched by the dog. It soon turns out that "Old Yeller" is a big help for Travis as he takes on the responsibilities of his absent father, and the two develop a strong bond, but there is some trouble ahead. This movie has a small cast, but most of the few who had roles in it put on decent performances, even if some are slightly flawed. Dorothy McGuire and Fess Parker as the Coates parents, Tommy Kirk as Travis (one of his many Disney roles), and actor/athlete Chuck Connors in the smaller role of Burn Sanderson, are all notable cast performances. On the other hand, I did not care much for Jeff York as the lazy, fast-talking Bud Searcy, or Beverly Washburn as Bud's daughter, Lisbeth, and when these two characters first appear, I've found that they may temporarily bring the entertainment value down a bit, but fortunately, they aren't usually a problem. For the most part, the plot is an intriguing one, with what Travis and Old Yeller go through together and the boy's initial reaction to the dog followed by the strong bond they develop. Obviously, SO many others have pointed this out, but parts of the film certainly are emotional as well, which also helps keep it from being underwhelming and forgettable. They also picked some nice, scenic filming locations for this particular live action Disney film. I'm sure many people through the generations have seen this movie in their childhood, but I didn't, so I obviously don't know what that's like. This certainly isn't the happiest movie a kid could watch, but its reputation shows that it clearly has pleased many of those who saw it as kids, so I guess it has succeeded with that goal as the decades have gone by, and likely continues to do so today. Many adults like this "Old Yeller" adaptation as well, which I can understand after seeing it myself. In my opinion, there are some weaker parts of the film, so I can't rate it as highly as some voters, but overall, it's a solid effort that has aged well. If you haven't seen this successful 1957 Disney animal movie, I will say that should you do decide to watch it, some parts could make you cry if you're an emotional kind of person, or maybe even if you're not that emotional (though I didn't cry), but this is a major reason why it's so widely remembered and praised.

    In 1860s Texas, a youngster must act as man of the house when his rancher-father joins a three-month-long cattle drive; he and his ever-patient, ever-smiling mother take in a lovable stray dog who saves his little brother from a bear, and all grow attached to the mongrel even as a strain of hydrophobia spreads throughout the wildlife. Simple, episodic frontier tale given the Walt Disney touch: lots of cute, heart-tugging sentiment, plus a prescient 'circle of life' message at the end. Tommy Kirk gives arguably his best juvenile performance here, and mom Dorothy McGuire beams commendably without lapsing into syrupy goodness. The gorgeous color photography, the warm family narrative, and a jaunty title song all conspired to make the picture a box-office winner, but the main reason it's called a Disney Classic today is because of that dog. Disney did many things right, one of which was picking the very best animal actors for his live-action comedies and adventures. This lop-eared hound is a beauty to behold, and should enchant even non-dog lovers! **1/2 from ****

    'Old Yeller' is a captivating drama, one of the finest live-action achievements from Disney. Its story is simple, jolly and at the same time sentimental, although the ending is devastating. Not all 'doggy' movies are great. This one is. Expert dog training is notorious, as well as the dog's intelligence. The dog Spike was a superb animal actor and, according to Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran, he was just like his "Old Yeller" character in everything. Of course, the dog's name isn't really "Old Yeller". He's just "Yeller". Like Arliss says, &laquo;He's not an ugly yeller dog! He's a pretty yeller dog!&raquo;. And a very sympathetic one, says I. He's definitely the best Doggone Dog in the West :) Tommy Kirk, Kevin Corcoran, Fess Parker, Dorothy McGuire, Jeff York, Chuck Connors and Beverly Washburn are all fine in their roles. There are few characters (and actors), which isn't the most common thing but works out fine for this film. Burn Sanderson is one of the most interesting: he is a cool chap, like a gentle giant. Bud Searcy is more like an anecdote and hopelessly lazy and boring but still hilarious. However, I think Travis and Katie are harsh on Arliss at times and they don't always give him proper explanations when he's asking a question. Plus, it bothers me a bit that Travis is always the one having the dogs for himself. Katie says that Travis had a dog when he was a child but Arliss didn't. For the 1st time, Arliss gets a dog - Yeller. Travis is a selfish douche towards Yeller at first. He changes a lot, which I think it's very well. But then it's as if he considers the dog as only his. One of Yeller's puppies was gonna be for Travis, but he didn't care so the puppy went for Arliss. Later, Travis apparently claims the puppy as only his. So, it's only the big brother who wins everything for him? What about the little brother? Nevertheless, these details don't interfere significantly in what is a fine movie. The soundtrack is dated but its charm remains intact. The wonderful settings of a very old Texas also help a lot to make this a great film. Title in Portugal: 'O Rapaz e o C&atilde;o'.

The movie features a good cast from the kids to the grown-ups everyone was just perfect; then I have to give Disney a good pat on the back for the dog training. It was just wonderful to see the dog's reactions and his behaviors showed that time went into the training of the dog. Even the child actor who played Arliss was good, he was impressive in his portrayal and I ended up loving him as his pocket never seemed to lack anything but fun. Yeller was a stray dog that happened to come into the life of the Coates family when their father, went out to search for work. His coming was welcomed by the youngest of the Coates, Arliss who always wanted a dog, but the eldest Travis was not so happy to have this new inclusion into the family and was ready to do anything to get Yeller out of the house. Travis changed his mind when one day he was in trouble and there was nobody around but Old Yeller to jump in and save him. (I'm purposely leaving out enough details so that you can enjoy the movie if you have not seen it yet) Walt Disney himself was the producer of this family hit, and it was well received by all who has seen it, the movie can be said to stand as one of the best films about a boy and his dog, although Walt Disney (the company) has tried many other dog and boy movies like Homeward Bound or Savage Sam, but none comes close to the kind of dramatic, adventure fun that Old Yeller delivers. The movie was well received as said and it brought in cash for Disney, so much so that the movie has been re-released, you will always find the DVD of Old Yeller available anywhere, so if like me you waited this long to see it, then maybe you should not wait any longer.

    This is what Disney did best in the 50's and early 60's with their live-action unit-no cynicism, no innuendo, just good family friendly storytelling with high production values and a moral. &nbsp;It is so refreshing to see this sort of movie, a true family movie, not just a 2 hour fart joke like so many kids movies are today. &nbsp;I watched this with my 9 year old daughter the other day, and, somewhat surprisingly, she remained completely engaged and enthralled throughout. &nbsp;I say surprised because so much of what is in the theater and on television for kids these days is just downright lazy, using flash, glitz, and breakneck pacing to distract from the rotten storytelling. &nbsp;Old Yeller, like most good stories, unfolds at a slower pace, but, because of the great storytelling, production, and acting, the payoff is not delayed, and the movie is satisfying throughout. &nbsp;It seems that today there is no true "family movie" category in cinema anymore, just sophomoric garbage for the kids, and empty violence, sex, and superficial titillation for everyone else. &nbsp;That is why it is so great to see movies like Old Yeller, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and other timeless live-action Disney family classics still getting some exposure.

    A boy brings a yellow dog home. The dog loves the family as much as they love him, but can the love last? I first saw this movie an extremely long time ago, and what did I think of it? I'll tell you. I thought that it was a masterpiece. But many years later, it's not a masterpiece, but a good movie. And it is a good movie, with a few flaws in it. What I mean is that there are flaws in this other wise perfect little film. I would have thought that this movie was perfect, but the last fifteen minutes were rather sad to watch. But other than that, I nevertheless thought that this movie was very good and entertaining. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece of a movie, nor would I call it one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen, but nevertheless, it is a very good movie that is worth watching. Old Yeller is a good old fashioned movie that is worth watching. When you watch this movie, you may end up feeling a little bit sad, because there are quite a few rather sad scenes in this film. I won't say anything about them, because it would most likely spoil the movie for you, and I don't want to do that. Could I watch this movie again if I had the chance, I probably would. I'm not saying that Old Yeller is a bad movie, it isn't a bad movie, but it just isn't one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen. On a scale from one to ten, with one being the worst and ten being the best, I will give this movie a rating of eight stars out of ten for being a movie that is not bad but has got a few flaws in it. For one of the very few times that I do so, I have to disagree with Leonard Maltin, this movie isn't one of the best. But don't get me wrong, I still like the movie. So all in all, Old Yeller is not one of the greatest movies ever made, but nevertheless, it is a good way to spend 83 minutes. But do I think that you should watch this movie? Yes I do. Who knows, when you watch this movie, you may think that it is one of the greatest movies that you have ever have seen, you may think that it is one of your all time favorite movies. For me, the main problem was the fact that this movie didn't age that good. I don't mean that it is outdated, but you can tell that it was made in the 1950's. Well anyway, this movie is not a masterpiece of a movie, but it is still a fun and very amusing movie to watch and enjoy, and that's what a movie is for, to watch and enjoy it. And when you watch this movie, you will probably enjoy it. 8/10

    I believe I first heard of this live action Disney movie from the 1950's late in my childhood (I was born nearly thirty years after this film's release), but never saw it until last year. I think it was late last summer when I first watched this adaptation of the "Old Yeller" novel by Fred Gipson, and from what I remember, I was impressed with a lot of it, but later on, I wasn't so sure anymore. I watched "The Shaggy Dog", another live action Disney dog movie from the 50's featuring Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran playing brothers, for the first time just this week. Shortly after watching that film and being fairly impressed with it, I have watched "Old Yeller" for the second time, and would say it was better for me than it was the first time, and also better than the other Disney dog movie I've mentioned, which I was expecting. In 1860's Texas, Jim Coates leaves his ranch to take part in a cattle drive, and won't be back for several months. On the ranch, he leaves behind his wife, Katie, and two sons Travis and Arliss. Travis, the older of the two brothers, is left to take his father's responsibilities. Shortly after his father leaves, Travis happens to be working outside when a stray yellow dog comes, scares the family mule, and makes it knock down the fence! Travis angrily chases this dog away, but the next day, he finds him back on the ranch already! Arliss has decided to adopt this dog, but after the trouble the mutt has already caused, Travis obviously doesn't want him around. However, the older Coates brother begins to have a change of heart when he discovers that the meat he left out overnight has surprisingly not been touched by the dog. It soon turns out that "Old Yeller" is a big help for Travis as he takes on the responsibilities of his absent father, and the two develop a strong bond, but there is some trouble ahead. This movie has a small cast, but most of the few who had roles in it put on decent performances, even if some are slightly flawed. Dorothy McGuire and Fess Parker as the Coates parents, Tommy Kirk as Travis (one of his many Disney roles), and actor/athlete Chuck Connors in the smaller role of Burn Sanderson, are all notable cast performances. On the other hand, I did not care much for Jeff York as the lazy, fast-talking Bud Searcy, or Beverly Washburn as Bud's daughter, Lisbeth, and when these two characters first appear, I've found that they may temporarily bring the entertainment value down a bit, but fortunately, they aren't usually a problem. For the most part, the plot is an intriguing one, with what Travis and Old Yeller go through together and the boy's initial reaction to the dog followed by the strong bond they develop. Obviously, SO many others have pointed this out, but parts of the film certainly are emotional as well, which also helps keep it from being underwhelming and forgettable. They also picked some nice, scenic filming locations for this particular live action Disney film. I'm sure many people through the generations have seen this movie in their childhood, but I didn't, so I obviously don't know what that's like. This certainly isn't the happiest movie a kid could watch, but its reputation shows that it clearly has pleased many of those who saw it as kids, so I guess it has succeeded with that goal as the decades have gone by, and likely continues to do so today. Many adults like this "Old Yeller" adaptation as well, which I can understand after seeing it myself. In my opinion, there are some weaker parts of the film, so I can't rate it as highly as some voters, but overall, it's a solid effort that has aged well. If you haven't seen this successful 1957 Disney animal movie, I will say that should you do decide to watch it, some parts could make you cry if you're an emotional kind of person, or maybe even if you're not that emotional (though I didn't cry), but this is a major reason why it's so widely remembered and praised.

    In 1860s Texas, a youngster must act as man of the house when his rancher-father joins a three-month-long cattle drive; he and his ever-patient, ever-smiling mother take in a lovable stray dog who saves his little brother from a bear, and all grow attached to the mongrel even as a strain of hydrophobia spreads throughout the wildlife. Simple, episodic frontier tale given the Walt Disney touch: lots of cute, heart-tugging sentiment, plus a prescient 'circle of life' message at the end. Tommy Kirk gives arguably his best juvenile performance here, and mom Dorothy McGuire beams commendably without lapsing into syrupy goodness. The gorgeous color photography, the warm family narrative, and a jaunty title song all conspired to make the picture a box-office winner, but the main reason it's called a Disney Classic today is because of that dog. Disney did many things right, one of which was picking the very best animal actors for his live-action comedies and adventures. This lop-eared hound is a beauty to behold, and should enchant even non-dog lovers! **1/2 from ****

    'Old Yeller' is a captivating drama, one of the finest live-action achievements from Disney. Its story is simple, jolly and at the same time sentimental, although the ending is devastating. Not all 'doggy' movies are great. This one is. Expert dog training is notorious, as well as the dog's intelligence. The dog Spike was a superb animal actor and, according to Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran, he was just like his "Old Yeller" character in everything. Of course, the dog's name isn't really "Old Yeller". He's just "Yeller". Like Arliss says, &laquo;He's not an ugly yeller dog! He's a pretty yeller dog!&raquo;. And a very sympathetic one, says I. He's definitely the best Doggone Dog in the West :) Tommy Kirk, Kevin Corcoran, Fess Parker, Dorothy McGuire, Jeff York, Chuck Connors and Beverly Washburn are all fine in their roles. There are few characters (and actors), which isn't the most common thing but works out fine for this film. Burn Sanderson is one of the most interesting: he is a cool chap, like a gentle giant. Bud Searcy is more like an anecdote and hopelessly lazy and boring but still hilarious. However, I think Travis and Katie are harsh on Arliss at times and they don't always give him proper explanations when he's asking a question. Plus, it bothers me a bit that Travis is always the one having the dogs for himself. Katie says that Travis had a dog when he was a child but Arliss didn't. For the 1st time, Arliss gets a dog - Yeller. Travis is a selfish douche towards Yeller at first. He changes a lot, which I think it's very well. But then it's as if he considers the dog as only his. One of Yeller's puppies was gonna be for Travis, but he didn't care so the puppy went for Arliss. Later, Travis apparently claims the puppy as only his. So, it's only the big brother who wins everything for him? What about the little brother? Nevertheless, these details don't interfere significantly in what is a fine movie. The soundtrack is dated but its charm remains intact. The wonderful settings of a very old Texas also help a lot to make this a great film. Title in Portugal: 'O Rapaz e o C&atilde;o'.

    Before I saw Old Yeller, I gave that distinction to the equally wonderful Lassie Come Home. After seeing Old Yeller, I think I have found the ultimate dog movie. Old Yeller for me does for dogs like The Three Lives of Thomasina does for cats and The Red Shoes does for dancing. In short, this film is a classic. It has beautiful cinematography and scenery. It has a beautiful story, and a truly affecting scene that anybody who's seen the movie will know what I'm talking about. It has a wonderfully-trained and adorable dog. It has some nice writing, and a pleasant score, as well as some fine direction and an excellent turn from Dorothy McGuire. I personally liked Kevin Cocoran and Tommy Kirk here, and much preferred them here than I did in Swiss Family Robinson. I didn't mind them then either, but they are more appealing and their characters are more likable in Old Yeller. In conclusion, a classic, moving, sweet and above all beautiful. Not to be missed! 10/10 Bethany Cox

    "Old Yeller" is a prime example of a movie that goes for a sentimental approach but does not overstep itself and condescend into becoming schmaltzy. Sure, most everybody can identify and get involved of the tale about a boy and his dog, but the filmmakers and script-writers have to be conscious enough about what they are doing to pull it off. "Old Yeller" is not a movie that bends down on its knees and pleads for you to like it. It just plays it straight and sweetly and gets the exact effect it wants out of you. In the movie, young but world-conscious Travis Coates (Tommy Kirk) is sad about the passing-away of his previous dog and unwillingly comes upon another companion when a golden retriever comes a-bounding into his life. Travis is initially skeptical of this dog, but is forced to adapt to him when his younger brother wants to adopt him. However, as time goes on, Travis himself becomes more and more attached to the retriever than his brother. And he forms not merely a friendship, but a partnership with this lovable canine, whom he names Old Yeller. There have been many boy-and-dog (or substitute "dog" for any other animal) stories over the years, trying to be "Old Yeller." Some have accomplished it like that wonderful 2000 movie "My Dog Skip." But this incredibly sentimental and heart-warming tale has immortalized itself with its ways of getting the audience involved. I'd be even as daring to say that people who did not growing up with a dog will be undoubtedly moved by this story unless they are a moral-devoid curmudgeon. I won't give away the ending of the movie because of the Internet Movie Database's guidelines, even though I think we all know the way this movie culminates. There's a saying going around that if you did not cry at the end of "Old Yeller" you are either hopelessly lacking a heart or a lousy hypocrite. I mean, how can your heartstrings not be pulled at by the way this movie culminates? Please keep in mind that this review is coming from a 19-year-old college student who re-watched the movie in his early years as an adult, not somebody simply reminiscing about cinema experiences of the past. "Old Yeller" aims for sympathy and it gets it. But it does not overplay its motives and storytelling techniques to the point where it becomes schmaltzy and unpleasantly over-sweet. From my personal experience, after having watched "Old Yeller" for the first time since sixth grade, I wanted nothing more than to walk up to my own dog and embrace him lovingly, which I did. Some movies are influential because of a revolutionary factor. Pictures like this work because they tread upon familiar ground, but do it right. "Old Yeller" is one of the best doggone dog movies in the West, East, North, and South. It's a wonderful little tale.

    In Old yeller, Travis (tommy kirk) is left alone with his ma (Dororthy McGuire) and little brother arliss (Kevin Cocoran) after his pa is off to sell cattle for money, so the family can get through the winter. so while he's gone for 3 months, he has to work like a man to get things done. along the way, he finds a dog. while initially he dislikes the dog for ruining his life, He comes to liking the dog. soon the two of them become inseparable. but will the Problems they face, such as the dog's original owner (played by the awesome chuck Connors) and an incurable contagious disease, tear them apart? I cannot stress this enough, Old Disney is, and will forever be better than the new Disney. It's movies like old yeller that will never be made again without heavy censorship. They would water down the hog attack scene. they would water down the ending. they would water down everything possible. But here's an original piece of work from Disney, and it's well worth buying on DVD or VHS, however you can find it.

    I know that many people have a soft place in their heart for "Old Yeller". In fact, the country group Confederate Railroad even sang a song where they lament that they should have KNOWN a woman was no good because 'she didn't cry when Old Yeller died'...and I guess they wouldn't think much of me, either! I did NOT particularly enjoy "Old Yeller" for one very important reason--this Labrador was probably the meanest dog I've ever seen on film! It loved fighting with other animals and when Yeller got rabies and needed to be put down, it was the result of him attacking yet another animal! So, although Disney desperately wanted me to cry along with Yeller's owner at his passing, I just thought it was a blessing! If you DO want to see a film about a boy and his animal, may I suggest a different Disney film? I just saw "So Dear to My Heart" and loved it. It's about a young boy who raises a lamb--and the film is sweet throughout. In fact, this film debuted about a decade BEFORE "Old Yeller" and this later film is an obvious copy. See this other film--you'll see that it's dandy entertainment throughout...and the animal isn't a nasty killing machine!

    Old Yeller is a culture icon, a movie that has stood long and I believe plans to stay that long, as long as no one tries to remake it. Based on a Fred Gipson's 1956 children book of the same name, Old Yeller is about a man's best friend, a dog who was ready to do anything to protect his human family. The movie is somewhat an icon, it has found its way into the homes of many, even those who haven't seen the movie have heard about it, thanks to references in the ever popular F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV series, where Phoebe didn't know that Yeller died in the end (Sorry, Spoiler for all of you who haven't seen the movie yet) or it's reference in Justice League as Green Lantern/John Stewart's favorite movie.

It was just wonderful to see the dog's reactions and his behaviors showed that time went into the training of the dog. Even the child actor who played Arliss was good, he was impressive in his portrayal and I ended up loving him as his pocket never seemed to lack anything but fun.

For the most part, the plot is an intriguing one, with what Travis and Old Yeller go through together and the boy's initial reaction to the dog followed by the strong bond they develop. Obviously, SO many others have pointed this out, but parts of the film certainly are emotional as well, which also helps keep it from being underwhelming and forgettable. They also picked some nice, scenic filming locations for this particular live action Disney film. I'm sure many people through the generations have seen this movie in their childhood, but I didn't, so I obviously don't know what that's like. This certainly isn't the happiest movie a kid could watch, but its reputation shows that it clearly has pleased many of those who saw it as kids, so I guess it has succeeded with that goal as the decades have gone by, and likely continues to do so today. Many adults like this "Old Yeller" adaptation as well, which I can understand after seeing it myself. In my opinion, there are some weaker parts of the film, so I can't rate it as highly as some voters, but overall, it's a solid effort that has aged well. If you haven't seen this successful 1957 Disney animal movie, I will say that should you do decide to watch it, some parts could make you cry if you're an emotional kind of person, or maybe even if you're not that emotional (though I didn't cry), but this is a major reason why it's so widely remembered and praised.

    In 1860s Texas, a youngster must act as man of the house when his rancher-father joins a three-month-long cattle drive; he and his ever-patient, ever-smiling mother take in a lovable stray dog who saves his little brother from a bear, and all grow attached to the mongrel even as a strain of hydrophobia spreads throughout the wildlife. Simple, episodic frontier tale given the Walt Disney touch: lots of cute, heart-tugging sentiment, plus a prescient 'circle of life' message at the end. Tommy Kirk gives arguably his best juvenile performance here, and mom Dorothy McGuire beams commendably without lapsing into syrupy goodness. The gorgeous color photography, the warm family narrative, and a jaunty title song all conspired to make the picture a box-office winner, but the main reason it's called a Disney Classic today is because of that dog. Disney did many things right, one of which was picking the very best animal actors for his live-action comedies and adventures. This lop-eared hound is a beauty to behold, and should enchant even non-dog lovers! **1/2 from ****

    'Old Yeller' is a captivating drama, one of the finest live-action achievements from Disney. Its story is simple, jolly and at the same time sentimental, although the ending is devastating. Not all 'doggy' movies are great. This one is. Expert dog training is notorious, as well as the dog's intelligence. The dog Spike was a superb animal actor and, according to Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran, he was just like his "Old Yeller" character in everything. Of course, the dog's name isn't really "Old Yeller". He's just "Yeller". Like Arliss says, &laquo;He's not an ugly yeller dog! He's a pretty yeller dog!&raquo;. And a very sympathetic one, says I. He's definitely the best Doggone Dog in the West :) Tommy Kirk, Kevin Corcoran, Fess Parker, Dorothy McGuire, Jeff York, Chuck Connors and Beverly Washburn are all fine in their roles. There are few characters (and actors), which isn't the most common thing but works out fine for this film. Burn Sanderson is one of the most interesting: he is a cool chap, like a gentle giant. Bud Searcy is more like an anecdote and hopelessly lazy and boring but still hilarious. However, I think Travis and Katie are harsh on Arliss at times and they don't always give him proper explanations when he's asking a question. Plus, it bothers me a bit that Travis is always the one having the dogs for himself. Katie says that Travis had a dog when he was a child but Arliss didn't. For the 1st time, Arliss gets a dog - Yeller. Travis is a selfish douche towards Yeller at first. He changes a lot, which I think it's very well. But then it's as if he considers the dog as only his. One of Yeller's puppies was gonna be for Travis, but he didn't care so the puppy went for Arliss. Later, Travis apparently claims the puppy as only his. So, it's only the big brother who wins everything for him? What about the little brother? Nevertheless, these details don't interfere significantly in what is a fine movie. The soundtrack is dated but its charm remains intact. The wonderful settings of a very old Texas also help a lot to make this a great film. Title in Portugal: 'O Rapaz e o C&atilde;o'.

    Before I saw Old Yeller, I gave that distinction to the equally wonderful Lassie Come Home. After seeing Old Yeller, I think I have found the ultimate dog movie. Old Yeller for me does for dogs like The Three Lives of Thomasina does for cats and The Red Shoes does for dancing. In short, this film is a classic. It has beautiful cinematography and scenery. It has a beautiful story, and a truly affecting scene that anybody who's seen the movie will know what I'm talking about. It has a wonderfully-trained and adorable dog. It has some nice writing, and a pleasant score, as well as some fine direction and an excellent turn from Dorothy McGuire. I personally liked Kevin Cocoran and Tommy Kirk here, and much preferred them here than I did in Swiss Family Robinson. I didn't mind them then either, but they are more appealing and their characters are more likable in Old Yeller. In conclusion, a classic, moving, sweet and above all beautiful. Not to be missed! 10/10 Bethany Cox

    "Old Yeller" is a prime example of a movie that goes for a sentimental approach but does not overstep itself and condescend into becoming schmaltzy. Sure, most everybody can identify and get involved of the tale about a boy and his dog, but the filmmakers and script-writers have to be conscious enough about what they are doing to pull it off. "Old Yeller" is not a movie that bends down on its knees and pleads for you to like it. It just plays it straight and sweetly and gets the exact effect it wants out of you. In the movie, young but world-conscious Travis Coates (Tommy Kirk) is sad about the passing-away of his previous dog and unwillingly comes upon another companion when a golden retriever comes a-bounding into his life. Travis is initially skeptical of this dog, but is forced to adapt to him when his younger brother wants to adopt him. However, as time goes on, Travis himself becomes more and more attached to the retriever than his brother. And he forms not merely a friendship, but a partnership with this lovable canine, whom he names Old Yeller. There have been many boy-and-dog (or substitute "dog" for any other animal) stories over the years, trying to be "Old Yeller." Some have accomplished it like that wonderful 2000 movie "My Dog Skip." But this incredibly sentimental and heart-warming tale has immortalized itself with its ways of getting the audience involved. I'd be even as daring to say that people who did not growing up with a dog will be undoubtedly moved by this story unless they are a moral-devoid curmudgeon. I won't give away the ending of the movie because of the Internet Movie Database's guidelines, even though I think we all know the way this movie culminates. There's a saying going around that if you did not cry at the end of "Old Yeller" you are either hopelessly lacking a heart or a lousy hypocrite. I mean, how can your heartstrings not be pulled at by the way this movie culminates? Please keep in mind that this review is coming from a 19-year-old college student who re-watched the movie in his early years as an adult, not somebody simply reminiscing about cinema experiences of the past. "Old Yeller" aims for sympathy and it gets it. But it does not overplay its motives and storytelling techniques to the point where it becomes schmaltzy and unpleasantly over-sweet. From my personal experience, after having watched "Old Yeller" for the first time since sixth grade, I wanted nothing more than to walk up to my own dog and embrace him lovingly, which I did. Some movies are influential because of a revolutionary factor. Pictures like this work because they tread upon familiar ground, but do it right. "Old Yeller" is one of the best doggone dog movies in the West, East, North, and South. It's a wonderful little tale.

    In Old yeller, Travis (tommy kirk) is left alone with his ma (Dororthy McGuire) and little brother arliss (Kevin Cocoran) after his pa is off to sell cattle for money, so the family can get through the winter. so while he's gone for 3 months, he has to work like a man to get things done. along the way, he finds a dog. while initially he dislikes the dog for ruining his life, He comes to liking the dog. soon the two of them become inseparable. but will the Problems they face, such as the dog's original owner (played by the awesome chuck Connors) and an incurable contagious disease, tear them apart? I cannot stress this enough, Old Disney is, and will forever be better than the new Disney. It's movies like old yeller that will never be made again without heavy censorship. They would water down the hog attack scene. they would water down the ending. they would water down everything possible. But here's an original piece of work from Disney, and it's well worth buying on DVD or VHS, however you can find it.
