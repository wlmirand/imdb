 <sinopse>
  The story of the famous and influential 1960's rock band and its lead singer and composer, Jim Morrison.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Oliver Stone's homage to 1960s rock group The Doors also doubles as a biography of the group's late singer, the "Electric Poet" Jim Morrison. The movie follows Morrison from his days as a film student in Los Angeles to his death in Paris in 1971, at the age of 27. The movie features a tour-de-force performance by Val Kilmer, who not only looks like Jim Morrison's long-lost twin brother, but also sounds so much like him that he did much of his own singing. It has been written that even the surviving Doors had trouble distinguishing Kilmer's vocals from Morrison's originals.

    One of the very best films I've seen in a cinema. A brilliant trip through the late sixties in what was tag-lined The Ultimate Story Of Sex, Drugs And Rock'n'Roll. The cinematography is rich in mood and puts you right there among the experience. The soundtrack of Doors tracks is incredibly captivating. The Doors is not a factually-accurate account of the band's history and exploits, as said by many critics including the band's keyboard player Ray Manzarek. Nonetheless, it's a fabulous immersion into the feeling of the wild and hedonistic times the band passed through. Watch it and drown down into it...

    A lot of people (Ray Manzarek & Robby Krieger included... ) didn't like Oliver Stone's 'Doors' film, but I appreciated it, and it's one of the many movies I own. It's not just about the music, it does try to speculate about Jim's psychology as well, and whilst it may not be true, the blend of fact with hypotheses and outright myth does create an intoxicating aura that captures the spirit of what life might have been like during Jim's phase of intense drug use... Sections of it are really trippy, even though I've always watched it straight... so, if you like the idea of The Doors music blended with weird and evocative ideas, then it could well be your thing...

    First of all let me state that I am a HUGE fan of Jim Morrison and The Doors. I have read 5 biography's on Morrison himself, so when I watched this movie for the first time I compared it based off of the pre determined knowledge I gathered of Jim. With that said, let me state that this movie though entertaining and enjoyable should not be taken seriously as a Doors/Morrison biopic. The movie generally portrays only the bad side of Jim Morrison. The drunken babbling leather clad womanizer. However, show's very little of the sensitive, caring, intelligent poetic Morrison. If one were to watch this movie not knowing who Jim Morrison was they would probably walk away with the impression that he was the biggest asshole to ever walk the face of the earth. The movie spans from a time shortly before The Doors were conceived in 1966 all the way to Jim Morrison's untimely death on July 3rd 1971. The best things about this movie is the awesome soundtrack and Val Kilmers performance as Morrison was quite good. Kilmer himself did 90% of the singing for this movie and at times sounds quite close to Morrison's voice. With that said though this movie seems to be mostly Oliver Stones take on who he thought Jim Morrison was, and in his mind how The Doors were conceived. Though I don't think Oliver Stone made this movie with the intention of making Morrison look bad, he kind of did in nonchalant way. If you're like me and a fan of The Doors you'll probably either feel one of two ways about this movie...Either you will watch it and think that Oliver Stone was a total asshole to malportraying Jim Morrison and The Doors...Or you will be like me, and enjoying for being the semi fictional semi none fictional movie it is. If you are new to Jim Morrison and The Doors...DO NOT...I repeat DO NOT take this movie as fact. Much of the movie is Hollywood fiction and there is A lot of things left out about who The Doors were and how they started one of the greatest American rock/blues groups of the 1960s.

    This movie captures the music, the look, and the overall of the Doors through their relatively short career. Oliver Stone is impeccably true to the music and the look - the musical instruments are perfect and authentic, from Ray Manzarek's Vox Organ to Robby Krieger's Gibson guitar. Val Kilmer does an excellent job as Jim, as do the rest of the actors playing the Doors. The performances are believable and true to the essence of the band. The film spends little time on the writing process, with the exception of a highlight of the film, which is the birth of "Light My Fire". The focus is more on the mythology on the band and on Jim himself, the Lizard King. As a Doors' fan, I appreciated the film on many levels, and felt it really got the story right. If you're expecting a detailed biography of the band, you'll be disappointed. However, for an enjoyable story that includes the highlights of the Doors' career, and many of their hits, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Great film!

    ***SPOILERS*** The true an tragic story of psychedelic rock music icon Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer, who together with his group "The Doors" went from the heights of Mt. Olympus to the depths of the Qattara Dpression in less then five years. It was in 1965 when Morrison was attending UCLA Film school that he had a revelation, helped by getting stoned on drugs, in the California Desert that he realized that his true calling was in music not film. Now back in civilization Morrison tried his hand on music and with three of his friends Ray Manzaredk Robbie Krieger & John Densmore, Kyle MacLachian Frank Whaley & Kevin Dillion, formed the rock group "The Doors" and the rest is rock & roll or hard rock history. It what seemed that like almost overnight Morrison's Doors became the most popular singing group in the US! Even eclipsing "The Beatles" & "Rolling Stones" in that they were home grown, born and raised in the USA, unlike their British counterparts. And what's more Jim Morrison & The Doors' music was far more original then any of the English groups. Who for the most part were only singing repackaged 1950's and early 1960's rock & roll bubble-gun music with English accents. It was at the hight of his popularity that Morrison's self-destructive qualities suddenly started to come to the surface. We get to see in the movie how Morrison began to drink and do drugs almost every hour of the day and night as he was preforming both on and off stage. His womanizing didn't help Morrison either in that he ran the risk of being sued in dozen of paternity suites from the women and young girls,as well as their outraged parents, that he engaged with . That lead to his life long woman companion Pamala Courson, Meg Ryan, becoming so depressed over Morrisons affairs, mostly with groupies, that she herself started turning to drugs on an almost daily basis! That ultimately lead to Pamala dying of an heroin overdose in 1974 at age 27. The same age that Morrison passed away from a suspected, no autopsy was preformed on his body, heroin overdose three years earlier! It was in 1969 at a concert in Miami that Morrison burnt out and a shell of his former self finally hit rock bottom and self destructed on stage in front of thousand of his fans. His once trim body bolted from beer & booze as well as being drunk and stoned out of his skull Morrison gave the performance of his life! That lead to his arrest on drug and morals, in exposing himself in public, charges that ended up putting him on ice or out of circulating form almost a year. Still Jim Morrison continued to live the kind of scuzzy and drug addictive life that had even his fellow Door members distance themselves and stopped talking to him. That's until he finally realized that his life won't last long with the damage it was doing to him both physically as well as mentally. In the early summer of 1971 Jim Morrison now trying to get his head back together and turn his already shattered life around traveled to Paris France together with Pamala to either write poetry or paint pictures. It was there that he ended up taking his last breath as well as suspected, but never proved, last mind altering drug trip. Waking up in the early morning of July 3, 1971 Morrison feeling ill and coughing up blood decided to take a hot bath in order to ease the pain. It was there that Pamala found him dead as a doornail a few hours later. Dead from the wild and crazy lifestyle that Jim Morrison lead that both immortalized as well as ended up killing him. P.S Check out the movie's director Oliver Stone as a film professor at the UCLA film school that Jim Morrison attended. There also the famed defense attorney William Kunstler playing himself as Jim Morrison's lawyer at his booze drug & indecent public exposer trail in Miami Florida.

    I never thought much of Val Kilmer, but after watching Oliver Stone's incredible biopic, The Doors, that perception has changed entirely. This is the ultimate story of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. Kilmer plays frontman of the famous 60's rock band The Doors, Jim Morrison. Morrison is a self absorbed, self destructive, self proclaimed poet whose experiences with drugs, sex, and music make him a fascinating mess of a man. Kilmer portrays him to perfection in one of the most immaculate and hypnotic biopics I've ever seen. I will be honest and say that I am pretty much going to enjoy any movie about rock and roll by default. The Commitments, Almost Famous, Pirate Radio, etc. All movies I love. But it doesn't mean that is the only reason I love this film. It is, however, a damn good reason. Stone's rendition of the 60's free love era is as haunting as it is captivating. The concert scenes in this film are astoundingly hypnotic because of the mesmerizing visuals and the dark engulfing Doors music playing so crisp and so beautifully. Kilmer did all of his own singing for this film and as the film progresses you start to wonder whether Morrison himself stepped in to play his own part. Kilmer looks and sounds just like the man. The concert bits of the film are Kilmer's vocals and the soundtrack itself is the original Morrison vocals, yet you could never tell the difference. This may have been the role Kilmer was born to play. At first I was worried I wouldn't like this film by the end because of the character of Jim Morrison. He is this ridiculously self-important, pompous douche that only speaks in poetry, calling himself the Lizard King and practically proclaiming himself as a prophet. But it is these bizarre beginnings that lead to the growth of his character into the self destructive, self loathing maniac we see in the last half of the film. Love him or hate him, he is a fascinating character and watching him grow and witnessing the chaos around him is so engaging and yet so frightening. Morrison, in this film, is the poster child for a man with no limitations. The way he destroys himself through drugs and alcohol is ugly, yet you cannot take your eyes off of it. Morrison's fascination with death and how it drives him to the brink of insanity, almost longing for death because it is the ultimate high, is such an asphyxiated tragedy. As much as we tell ourselves we don't, we long to see the levels this man will stoop to and just how far his psychotic nature will take him. The Doors is a film that satisfies our asphyxiation with tragedy and the unfortunate, while telling the story through such a hypnotic and overwhelming method. I've seen a lot of Oliver Stone films and they are all fantastic, but this one has to be my favorite, thus far. Jim Morrison is just such a deranged yet fascinating man whose story is so engaging and yet so bleak and misguided. There were so many things wrong with this man and this film exemplifies them all and develops the story through such a psychedelic medium. I consider this film a masterful work of art and one of the best biopics I've ever seen. At two hours and twenty minutes, not a second of this film is wasted and I never wanted it to end.

    The only reason I say that is because the movie really wasn't about the Doors and more about Jim Morrison. The excesses of a Man who really didn't wish to be famous for the things he was famous for(Good looks, Long hair Etc). He wished to be famous for the words he created. So the movie tells the story of the spirit of the sixties also the excesses. I just recently re watched this movie. I first saw it in theaters.Although I wasn't very familiar with the Doors I was intrigued and captivated by the portrayal of Jim Morrison. From the very beginning of Jim being in the car with his parents to each time after he is on the screen you almost could feel the heat that was building within this man. As if the Doors were just a backdrop to Jim's artistic masterpiece. I feel that Oliver Stone was simply paying tribute to the man who probably set him on his way movie making destiny. The wild concert scenes were interesting to see that concert going and the way people enjoy themselves at concerts has not changed much. I believed that the Doors were so short lived was because that the band or, Ray Manzarek put so much stock and interest into Jim Morrison's antics and profound words that they didn't pit much effort in making the music just as strong as the words. So in doing so the music became background instead of sharing the spotlight with the words. Do I think Oliver showed that? Well kinda, as in certain scenes he speaks on the division in the band. Such as when they were at Andy Warhol's party. Jim Morrison in this portrayal was simply again everybody but he was more against those that appreciated him than those who didn't. To him everything was a game something to be toyed with and see how far to the thresholds it can be pushed before it pushes back or breaks. Especially the woman in his life. Of course if you are familiar with the Doors you already know what Morrison's outcome was. But,I believe this movie gives more of an insight of just how tortured this soul was and how because of the whole "Free to be me" Sixties maybe if some kind of intervention was imposed we might still have Jim Morrison with us< But would that be a good thing, See the movie and then answer.

    This movie is just plain awesome. Val Kilmer BECAME Jim Morrison. The movie soundtrack is great, the acting is great and this is definitely one of Oliver Stone's best movies. I don't see how Val Kilmer wasn't up for an Academy Award, as he WAS Jim Morrison. No one else can portray Morrison the way Val Kilmer did. NO ONE. This is a must see for all Doors fans.The movie has a great amount of memorable scenes, such as the Warhol party, the desert trip and the blood ritual. Kilmer did a lot of his own singing and he did a great job. This is Val Kilmer's greatest movie ever. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10 stars. GO SEE IT!!

    this movie changed my life.... I being born much after the epoch of the Doors or in fact the whole psychedelic generation was gifted by such a fantastic movie that far outlives all the other attempts at cinematic brilliance of the time period..... wow I found some LSD and I ate it... and I loved the Doors!!! I love everything about this movie! It is Val Kilmers Opus Rex, It is Oliver Stone's Citizen Kane of the 60's... Jim Morrison was and will remain an enigma of that generation!!! His current tax woes make me want to scream "FUCK IT MOVE TO France" and let us start a secret society of Doors fanatics and American expatriats.

    I never thought much of Val Kilmer, but after watching Oliver Stone's incredible biopic, The Doors, that perception has changed entirely. This is the ultimate story of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. Kilmer plays frontman of the famous 60's rock band The Doors, Jim Morrison. Morrison is a self absorbed, self destructive, self proclaimed poet whose experiences with drugs, sex, and music make him a fascinating mess of a man. Kilmer portrays him to perfection in one of the most immaculate and hypnotic biopics I've ever seen. I will be honest and say that I am pretty much going to enjoy any movie about rock and roll by default. The Commitments, Almost Famous, Pirate Radio, etc. All movies I love. But it doesn't mean that is the only reason I love this film. It is, however, a damn good reason. Stone's rendition of the 60's free love era is as haunting as it is captivating. The concert scenes in this film are astoundingly hypnotic because of the mesmerizing visuals and the dark engulfing Doors music playing so crisp and so beautifully. Kilmer did all of his own singing for this film and as the film progresses you start to wonder whether Morrison himself stepped in to play his own part. Kilmer looks and sounds just like the man. The concert bits of the film are Kilmer's vocals and the soundtrack itself is the original Morrison vocals, yet you could never tell the difference. This may have been the role Kilmer was born to play. At first I was worried I wouldn't like this film by the end because of the character of Jim Morrison. He is this ridiculously self-important, pompous douche that only speaks in poetry, calling himself the Lizard King and practically proclaiming himself as a prophet. But it is these bizarre beginnings that lead to the growth of his character into the self destructive, self loathing maniac we see in the last half of the film. Love him or hate him, he is a fascinating character and watching him grow and witnessing the chaos around him is so engaging and yet so frightening. Morrison, in this film, is the poster child for a man with no limitations. The way he destroys himself through drugs and alcohol is ugly, yet you cannot take your eyes off of it. Morrison's fascination with death and how it drives him to the brink of insanity, almost longing for death because it is the ultimate high, is such an asphyxiated tragedy. As much as we tell ourselves we don't, we long to see the levels this man will stoop to and just how far his psychotic nature will take him. The Doors is a film that satisfies our asphyxiation with tragedy and the unfortunate, while telling the story through such a hypnotic and overwhelming method. I've seen a lot of Oliver Stone films and they are all fantastic, but this one has to be my favorite, thus far. Jim Morrison is just such a deranged yet fascinating man whose story is so engaging and yet so bleak and misguided. There were so many things wrong with this man and this film exemplifies them all and develops the story through such a psychedelic medium. I consider this film a masterful work of art and one of the best biopics I've ever seen. At two hours and twenty minutes, not a second of this film is wasted and I never wanted it to end.

    The only reason I say that is because the movie really wasn't about the Doors and more about Jim Morrison. The excesses of a Man who really didn't wish to be famous for the things he was famous for(Good looks, Long hair Etc). He wished to be famous for the words he created. So the movie tells the story of the spirit of the sixties also the excesses. I just recently re watched this movie. I first saw it in theaters.Although I wasn't very familiar with the Doors I was intrigued and captivated by the portrayal of Jim Morrison. From the very beginning of Jim being in the car with his parents to each time after he is on the screen you almost could feel the heat that was building within this man. As if the Doors were just a backdrop to Jim's artistic masterpiece. I feel that Oliver Stone was simply paying tribute to the man who probably set him on his way movie making destiny. The wild concert scenes were interesting to see that concert going and the way people enjoy themselves at concerts has not changed much. I believed that the Doors were so short lived was because that the band or, Ray Manzarek put so much stock and interest into Jim Morrison's antics and profound words that they didn't pit much effort in making the music just as strong as the words. So in doing so the music became background instead of sharing the spotlight with the words. Do I think Oliver showed that? Well kinda, as in certain scenes he speaks on the division in the band. Such as when they were at Andy Warhol's party. Jim Morrison in this portrayal was simply again everybody but he was more against those that appreciated him than those who didn't. To him everything was a game something to be toyed with and see how far to the thresholds it can be pushed before it pushes back or breaks. Especially the woman in his life. Of course if you are familiar with the Doors you already know what Morrison's outcome was. But,I believe this movie gives more of an insight of just how tortured this soul was and how because of the whole "Free to be me" Sixties maybe if some kind of intervention was imposed we might still have Jim Morrison with us< But would that be a good thing, See the movie and then answer.

    This movie is just plain awesome. Val Kilmer BECAME Jim Morrison. The movie soundtrack is great, the acting is great and this is definitely one of Oliver Stone's best movies. I don't see how Val Kilmer wasn't up for an Academy Award, as he WAS Jim Morrison. No one else can portray Morrison the way Val Kilmer did. NO ONE. This is a must see for all Doors fans.The movie has a great amount of memorable scenes, such as the Warhol party, the desert trip and the blood ritual. Kilmer did a lot of his own singing and he did a great job. This is Val Kilmer's greatest movie ever. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10 stars. GO SEE IT!!

    this movie changed my life.... I being born much after the epoch of the Doors or in fact the whole psychedelic generation was gifted by such a fantastic movie that far outlives all the other attempts at cinematic brilliance of the time period..... wow I found some LSD and I ate it... and I loved the Doors!!! I love everything about this movie! It is Val Kilmers Opus Rex, It is Oliver Stone's Citizen Kane of the 60's... Jim Morrison was and will remain an enigma of that generation!!! His current tax woes make me want to scream "FUCK IT MOVE TO France" and let us start a secret society of Doors fanatics and American expatriats.

    One of the very best films I've seen in a cinema. A brilliant trip through the late sixties in what was tag-lined The Ultimate Story Of Sex, Drugs And Rock'n'Roll. The cinematography is rich in mood and puts you right there among the experience. The soundtrack of Doors tracks is incredibly captivating. The Doors is not a factually-accurate account of the band's history and exploits, as said by many critics including the band's keyboard player Ray Manzarek. Nonetheless, it's a fabulous immersion into the feeling of the wild and hedonistic times the band passed through. Watch it and drown down into it...

    A lot of people (Ray Manzarek & Robby Krieger included... ) didn't like Oliver Stone's 'Doors' film, but I appreciated it, and it's one of the many movies I own. It's not just about the music, it does try to speculate about Jim's psychology as well, and whilst it may not be true, the blend of fact with hypotheses and outright myth does create an intoxicating aura that captures the spirit of what life might have been like during Jim's phase of intense drug use... Sections of it are really trippy, even though I've always watched it straight... so, if you like the idea of The Doors music blended with weird and evocative ideas, then it could well be your thing...

    First of all let me state that I am a HUGE fan of Jim Morrison and The Doors. I have read 5 biography's on Morrison himself, so when I watched this movie for the first time I compared it based off of the pre determined knowledge I gathered of Jim. With that said, let me state that this movie though entertaining and enjoyable should not be taken seriously as a Doors/Morrison biopic. The movie generally portrays only the bad side of Jim Morrison. The drunken babbling leather clad womanizer. However, show's very little of the sensitive, caring, intelligent poetic Morrison. If one were to watch this movie not knowing who Jim Morrison was they would probably walk away with the impression that he was the biggest asshole to ever walk the face of the earth. The movie spans from a time shortly before The Doors were conceived in 1966 all the way to Jim Morrison's untimely death on July 3rd 1971. The best things about this movie is the awesome soundtrack and Val Kilmers performance as Morrison was quite good. Kilmer himself did 90% of the singing for this movie and at times sounds quite close to Morrison's voice. With that said though this movie seems to be mostly Oliver Stones take on who he thought Jim Morrison was, and in his mind how The Doors were conceived. Though I don't think Oliver Stone made this movie with the intention of making Morrison look bad, he kind of did in nonchalant way. If you're like me and a fan of The Doors you'll probably either feel one of two ways about this movie...Either you will watch it and think that Oliver Stone was a total asshole to malportraying Jim Morrison and The Doors...Or you will be like me, and enjoying for being the semi fictional semi none fictional movie it is. If you are new to Jim Morrison and The Doors...DO NOT...I repeat DO NOT take this movie as fact. Much of the movie is Hollywood fiction and there is A lot of things left out about who The Doors were and how they started one of the greatest American rock/blues groups of the 1960s.

    This movie captures the music, the look, and the overall of the Doors through their relatively short career. Oliver Stone is impeccably true to the music and the look - the musical instruments are perfect and authentic, from Ray Manzarek's Vox Organ to Robby Krieger's Gibson guitar. Val Kilmer does an excellent job as Jim, as do the rest of the actors playing the Doors. The performances are believable and true to the essence of the band. The film spends little time on the writing process, with the exception of a highlight of the film, which is the birth of "Light My Fire". The focus is more on the mythology on the band and on Jim himself, the Lizard King. As a Doors' fan, I appreciated the film on many levels, and felt it really got the story right. If you're expecting a detailed biography of the band, you'll be disappointed. However, for an enjoyable story that includes the highlights of the Doors' career, and many of their hits, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Great film!

    ***SPOILERS*** The true an tragic story of psychedelic rock music icon Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer, who together with his group "The Doors" went from the heights of Mt. Olympus to the depths of the Qattara Dpression in less then five years. It was in 1965 when Morrison was attending UCLA Film school that he had a revelation, helped by getting stoned on drugs, in the California Desert that he realized that his true calling was in music not film. Now back in civilization Morrison tried his hand on music and with three of his friends Ray Manzaredk Robbie Krieger & John Densmore, Kyle MacLachian Frank Whaley & Kevin Dillion, formed the rock group "The Doors" and the rest is rock & roll or hard rock history. It what seemed that like almost overnight Morrison's Doors became the most popular singing group in the US! Even eclipsing "The Beatles" & "Rolling Stones" in that they were home grown, born and raised in the USA, unlike their British counterparts. And what's more Jim Morrison & The Doors' music was far more original then any of the English groups. Who for the most part were only singing repackaged 1950's and early 1960's rock & roll bubble-gun music with English accents. It was at the hight of his popularity that Morrison's self-destructive qualities suddenly started to come to the surface. We get to see in the movie how Morrison began to drink and do drugs almost every hour of the day and night as he was preforming both on and off stage. His womanizing didn't help Morrison either in that he ran the risk of being sued in dozen of paternity suites from the women and young girls,as well as their outraged parents, that he engaged with . That lead to his life long woman companion Pamala Courson, Meg Ryan, becoming so depressed over Morrisons affairs, mostly with groupies, that she herself started turning to drugs on an almost daily basis! That ultimately lead to Pamala dying of an heroin overdose in 1974 at age 27. The same age that Morrison passed away from a suspected, no autopsy was preformed on his body, heroin overdose three years earlier! It was in 1969 at a concert in Miami that Morrison burnt out and a shell of his former self finally hit rock bottom and self destructed on stage in front of thousand of his fans. His once trim body bolted from beer & booze as well as being drunk and stoned out of his skull Morrison gave the performance of his life! That lead to his arrest on drug and morals, in exposing himself in public, charges that ended up putting him on ice or out of circulating form almost a year. Still Jim Morrison continued to live the kind of scuzzy and drug addictive life that had even his fellow Door members distance themselves and stopped talking to him. That's until he finally realized that his life won't last long with the damage it was doing to him both physically as well as mentally. In the early summer of 1971 Jim Morrison now trying to get his head back together and turn his already shattered life around traveled to Paris France together with Pamala to either write poetry or paint pictures. It was there that he ended up taking his last breath as well as suspected, but never proved, last mind altering drug trip. Waking up in the early morning of July 3, 1971 Morrison feeling ill and coughing up blood decided to take a hot bath in order to ease the pain. It was there that Pamala found him dead as a doornail a few hours later. Dead from the wild and crazy lifestyle that Jim Morrison lead that both immortalized as well as ended up killing him. P.S Check out the movie's director Oliver Stone as a film professor at the UCLA film school that Jim Morrison attended. There also the famed defense attorney William Kunstler playing himself as Jim Morrison's lawyer at his booze drug & indecent public exposer trail in Miami Florida.

    This movie captures the music, the look, and the overall of the Doors through their relatively short career. Oliver Stone is impeccably true to the music and the look - the musical instruments are perfect and authentic, from Ray Manzarek's Vox Organ to Robby Krieger's Gibson guitar. Val Kilmer does an excellent job as Jim, as do the rest of the actors playing the Doors. The performances are believable and true to the essence of the band. The film spends little time on the writing process, with the exception of a highlight of the film, which is the birth of "Light My Fire". The focus is more on the mythology on the band and on Jim himself, the Lizard King. As a Doors' fan, I appreciated the film on many levels, and felt it really got the story right. If you're expecting a detailed biography of the band, you'll be disappointed. However, for an enjoyable story that includes the highlights of the Doors' career, and many of their hits, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Great film!

    ***SPOILERS*** The true an tragic story of psychedelic rock music icon Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer, who together with his group "The Doors" went from the heights of Mt. Olympus to the depths of the Qattara Dpression in less then five years. It was in 1965 when Morrison was attending UCLA Film school that he had a revelation, helped by getting stoned on drugs, in the California Desert that he realized that his true calling was in music not film. Now back in civilization Morrison tried his hand on music and with three of his friends Ray Manzaredk Robbie Krieger & John Densmore, Kyle MacLachian Frank Whaley & Kevin Dillion, formed the rock group "The Doors" and the rest is rock & roll or hard rock history. It what seemed that like almost overnight Morrison's Doors became the most popular singing group in the US! Even eclipsing "The Beatles" & "Rolling Stones" in that they were home grown, born and raised in the USA, unlike their British counterparts. And what's more Jim Morrison & The Doors' music was far more original then any of the English groups. Who for the most part were only singing repackaged 1950's and early 1960's rock & roll bubble-gun music with English accents. It was at the hight of his popularity that Morrison's self-destructive qualities suddenly started to come to the surface. We get to see in the movie how Morrison began to drink and do drugs almost every hour of the day and night as he was preforming both on and off stage. His womanizing didn't help Morrison either in that he ran the risk of being sued in dozen of paternity suites from the women and young girls,as well as their outraged parents, that he engaged with . That lead to his life long woman companion Pamala Courson, Meg Ryan, becoming so depressed over Morrisons affairs, mostly with groupies, that she herself started turning to drugs on an almost daily basis! That ultimately lead to Pamala dying of an heroin overdose in 1974 at age 27. The same age that Morrison passed away from a suspected, no autopsy was preformed on his body, heroin overdose three years earlier! It was in 1969 at a concert in Miami that Morrison burnt out and a shell of his former self finally hit rock bottom and self destructed on stage in front of thousand of his fans. His once trim body bolted from beer & booze as well as being drunk and stoned out of his skull Morrison gave the performance of his life! That lead to his arrest on drug and morals, in exposing himself in public, charges that ended up putting him on ice or out of circulating form almost a year. Still Jim Morrison continued to live the kind of scuzzy and drug addictive life that had even his fellow Door members distance themselves and stopped talking to him. That's until he finally realized that his life won't last long with the damage it was doing to him both physically as well as mentally. In the early summer of 1971 Jim Morrison now trying to get his head back together and turn his already shattered life around traveled to Paris France together with Pamala to either write poetry or paint pictures. It was there that he ended up taking his last breath as well as suspected, but never proved, last mind altering drug trip. Waking up in the early morning of July 3, 1971 Morrison feeling ill and coughing up blood decided to take a hot bath in order to ease the pain. It was there that Pamala found him dead as a doornail a few hours later. Dead from the wild and crazy lifestyle that Jim Morrison lead that both immortalized as well as ended up killing him. P.S Check out the movie's director Oliver Stone as a film professor at the UCLA film school that Jim Morrison attended. There also the famed defense attorney William Kunstler playing himself as Jim Morrison's lawyer at his booze drug & indecent public exposer trail in Miami Florida.

    I never thought much of Val Kilmer, but after watching Oliver Stone's incredible biopic, The Doors, that perception has changed entirely. This is the ultimate story of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. Kilmer plays frontman of the famous 60's rock band The Doors, Jim Morrison. Morrison is a self absorbed, self destructive, self proclaimed poet whose experiences with drugs, sex, and music make him a fascinating mess of a man. Kilmer portrays him to perfection in one of the most immaculate and hypnotic biopics I've ever seen. I will be honest and say that I am pretty much going to enjoy any movie about rock and roll by default. The Commitments, Almost Famous, Pirate Radio, etc. All movies I love. But it doesn't mean that is the only reason I love this film. It is, however, a damn good reason. Stone's rendition of the 60's free love era is as haunting as it is captivating. The concert scenes in this film are astoundingly hypnotic because of the mesmerizing visuals and the dark engulfing Doors music playing so crisp and so beautifully. Kilmer did all of his own singing for this film and as the film progresses you start to wonder whether Morrison himself stepped in to play his own part. Kilmer looks and sounds just like the man. The concert bits of the film are Kilmer's vocals and the soundtrack itself is the original Morrison vocals, yet you could never tell the difference. This may have been the role Kilmer was born to play. At first I was worried I wouldn't like this film by the end because of the character of Jim Morrison. He is this ridiculously self-important, pompous douche that only speaks in poetry, calling himself the Lizard King and practically proclaiming himself as a prophet. But it is these bizarre beginnings that lead to the growth of his character into the self destructive, self loathing maniac we see in the last half of the film. Love him or hate him, he is a fascinating character and watching him grow and witnessing the chaos around him is so engaging and yet so frightening. Morrison, in this film, is the poster child for a man with no limitations. The way he destroys himself through drugs and alcohol is ugly, yet you cannot take your eyes off of it. Morrison's fascination with death and how it drives him to the brink of insanity, almost longing for death because it is the ultimate high, is such an asphyxiated tragedy. As much as we tell ourselves we don't, we long to see the levels this man will stoop to and just how far his psychotic nature will take him. The Doors is a film that satisfies our asphyxiation with tragedy and the unfortunate, while telling the story through such a hypnotic and overwhelming method. I've seen a lot of Oliver Stone films and they are all fantastic, but this one has to be my favorite, thus far. Jim Morrison is just such a deranged yet fascinating man whose story is so engaging and yet so bleak and misguided. There were so many things wrong with this man and this film exemplifies them all and develops the story through such a psychedelic medium. I consider this film a masterful work of art and one of the best biopics I've ever seen. At two hours and twenty minutes, not a second of this film is wasted and I never wanted it to end.

    The only reason I say that is because the movie really wasn't about the Doors and more about Jim Morrison. The excesses of a Man who really didn't wish to be famous for the things he was famous for(Good looks, Long hair Etc). He wished to be famous for the words he created. So the movie tells the story of the spirit of the sixties also the excesses. I just recently re watched this movie. I first saw it in theaters.Although I wasn't very familiar with the Doors I was intrigued and captivated by the portrayal of Jim Morrison. From the very beginning of Jim being in the car with his parents to each time after he is on the screen you almost could feel the heat that was building within this man. As if the Doors were just a backdrop to Jim's artistic masterpiece. I feel that Oliver Stone was simply paying tribute to the man who probably set him on his way movie making destiny. The wild concert scenes were interesting to see that concert going and the way people enjoy themselves at concerts has not changed much. I believed that the Doors were so short lived was because that the band or, Ray Manzarek put so much stock and interest into Jim Morrison's antics and profound words that they didn't pit much effort in making the music just as strong as the words. So in doing so the music became background instead of sharing the spotlight with the words. Do I think Oliver showed that? Well kinda, as in certain scenes he speaks on the division in the band. Such as when they were at Andy Warhol's party. Jim Morrison in this portrayal was simply again everybody but he was more against those that appreciated him than those who didn't. To him everything was a game something to be toyed with and see how far to the thresholds it can be pushed before it pushes back or breaks. Especially the woman in his life. Of course if you are familiar with the Doors you already know what Morrison's outcome was. But,I believe this movie gives more of an insight of just how tortured this soul was and how because of the whole "Free to be me" Sixties maybe if some kind of intervention was imposed we might still have Jim Morrison with us< But would that be a good thing, See the movie and then answer.

    This movie is just plain awesome. Val Kilmer BECAME Jim Morrison. The movie soundtrack is great, the acting is great and this is definitely one of Oliver Stone's best movies. I don't see how Val Kilmer wasn't up for an Academy Award, as he WAS Jim Morrison. No one else can portray Morrison the way Val Kilmer did. NO ONE. This is a must see for all Doors fans.The movie has a great amount of memorable scenes, such as the Warhol party, the desert trip and the blood ritual. Kilmer did a lot of his own singing and he did a great job. This is Val Kilmer's greatest movie ever. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10 stars. GO SEE IT!!

    this movie changed my life.... I being born much after the epoch of the Doors or in fact the whole psychedelic generation was gifted by such a fantastic movie that far outlives all the other attempts at cinematic brilliance of the time period..... wow I found some LSD and I ate it... and I loved the Doors!!! I love everything about this movie! It is Val Kilmers Opus Rex, It is Oliver Stone's Citizen Kane of the 60's... Jim Morrison was and will remain an enigma of that generation!!! His current tax woes make me want to scream "FUCK IT MOVE TO France" and let us start a secret society of Doors fanatics and American expatriats.

    One of the very best films I've seen in a cinema. A brilliant trip through the late sixties in what was tag-lined The Ultimate Story Of Sex, Drugs And Rock'n'Roll. The cinematography is rich in mood and puts you right there among the experience. The soundtrack of Doors tracks is incredibly captivating. The Doors is not a factually-accurate account of the band's history and exploits, as said by many critics including the band's keyboard player Ray Manzarek. Nonetheless, it's a fabulous immersion into the feeling of the wild and hedonistic times the band passed through. Watch it and drown down into it...

    A lot of people (Ray Manzarek & Robby Krieger included... ) didn't like Oliver Stone's 'Doors' film, but I appreciated it, and it's one of the many movies I own. It's not just about the music, it does try to speculate about Jim's psychology as well, and whilst it may not be true, the blend of fact with hypotheses and outright myth does create an intoxicating aura that captures the spirit of what life might have been like during Jim's phase of intense drug use... Sections of it are really trippy, even though I've always watched it straight... so, if you like the idea of The Doors music blended with weird and evocative ideas, then it could well be your thing...

    First of all let me state that I am a HUGE fan of Jim Morrison and The Doors. I have read 5 biography's on Morrison himself, so when I watched this movie for the first time I compared it based off of the pre determined knowledge I gathered of Jim. With that said, let me state that this movie though entertaining and enjoyable should not be taken seriously as a Doors/Morrison biopic. The movie generally portrays only the bad side of Jim Morrison. The drunken babbling leather clad womanizer. However, show's very little of the sensitive, caring, intelligent poetic Morrison. If one were to watch this movie not knowing who Jim Morrison was they would probably walk away with the impression that he was the biggest asshole to ever walk the face of the earth. The movie spans from a time shortly before The Doors were conceived in 1966 all the way to Jim Morrison's untimely death on July 3rd 1971. The best things about this movie is the awesome soundtrack and Val Kilmers performance as Morrison was quite good. Kilmer himself did 90% of the singing for this movie and at times sounds quite close to Morrison's voice. With that said though this movie seems to be mostly Oliver Stones take on who he thought Jim Morrison was, and in his mind how The Doors were conceived. Though I don't think Oliver Stone made this movie with the intention of making Morrison look bad, he kind of did in nonchalant way. If you're like me and a fan of The Doors you'll probably either feel one of two ways about this movie...Either you will watch it and think that Oliver Stone was a total asshole to malportraying Jim Morrison and The Doors...Or you will be like me, and enjoying for being the semi fictional semi none fictional movie it is. If you are new to Jim Morrison and The Doors...DO NOT...I repeat DO NOT take this movie as fact. Much of the movie is Hollywood fiction and there is A lot of things left out about who The Doors were and how they started one of the greatest American rock/blues groups of the 1960s.

    I never thought much of Val Kilmer, but after watching Oliver Stone's incredible biopic, The Doors, that perception has changed entirely. This is the ultimate story of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. Kilmer plays frontman of the famous 60's rock band The Doors, Jim Morrison. Morrison is a self absorbed, self destructive, self proclaimed poet whose experiences with drugs, sex, and music make him a fascinating mess of a man.

    One of the very best films I've seen in a cinema. A brilliant trip through the late sixties in what was tag-lined The Ultimate Story Of Sex, Drugs And Rock'n'Roll. The cinematography is rich in mood and puts you right there among the experience. The soundtrack of Doors tracks is incredibly captivating. The Doors is not a factually-accurate account of the band's history and exploits, as said by many critics including the band's keyboard player Ray Manzarek. Nonetheless, it's a fabulous immersion into the feeling of the wild and hedonistic times the band passed through. Watch it and drown down into it...

    A lot of people (Ray Manzarek & Robby Krieger included... ) didn't like Oliver Stone's 'Doors' film, but I appreciated it, and it's one of the many movies I own. It's not just about the music, it does try to speculate about Jim's psychology as well, and whilst it may not be true, the blend of fact with hypotheses and outright myth does create an intoxicating aura that captures the spirit of what life might have been like during Jim's phase of intense drug use... Sections of it are really trippy, even though I've always watched it straight... so, if you like the idea of The Doors music blended with weird and evocative ideas, then it could well be your thing...

    First of all let me state that I am a HUGE fan of Jim Morrison and The Doors. I have read 5 biography's on Morrison himself, so when I watched this movie for the first time I compared it based off of the pre determined knowledge I gathered of Jim. With that said, let me state that this movie though entertaining and enjoyable should not be taken seriously as a Doors/Morrison biopic. The movie generally portrays only the bad side of Jim Morrison. The drunken babbling leather clad womanizer. However, show's very little of the sensitive, caring, intelligent poetic Morrison. If one were to watch this movie not knowing who Jim Morrison was they would probably walk away with the impression that he was the biggest asshole to ever walk the face of the earth. The movie spans from a time shortly before The Doors were conceived in 1966 all the way to Jim Morrison's untimely death on July 3rd 1971. The best things about this movie is the awesome soundtrack and Val Kilmers performance as Morrison was quite good. Kilmer himself did 90% of the singing for this movie and at times sounds quite close to Morrison's voice. With that said though this movie seems to be mostly Oliver Stones take on who he thought Jim Morrison was, and in his mind how The Doors were conceived. Though I don't think Oliver Stone made this movie with the intention of making Morrison look bad, he kind of did in nonchalant way. If you're like me and a fan of The Doors you'll probably either feel one of two ways about this movie...Either you will watch it and think that Oliver Stone was a total asshole to malportraying Jim Morrison and The Doors...Or you will be like me, and enjoying for being the semi fictional semi none fictional movie it is. If you are new to Jim Morrison and The Doors...DO NOT...I repeat DO NOT take this movie as fact. Much of the movie is Hollywood fiction and there is A lot of things left out about who The Doors were and how they started one of the greatest American rock/blues groups of the 1960s.

    This movie captures the music, the look, and the overall of the Doors through their relatively short career. Oliver Stone is impeccably true to the music and the look - the musical instruments are perfect and authentic, from Ray Manzarek's Vox Organ to Robby Krieger's Gibson guitar. Val Kilmer does an excellent job as Jim, as do the rest of the actors playing the Doors. The performances are believable and true to the essence of the band. The film spends little time on the writing process, with the exception of a highlight of the film, which is the birth of "Light My Fire". The focus is more on the mythology on the band and on Jim himself, the Lizard King. As a Doors' fan, I appreciated the film on many levels, and felt it really got the story right. If you're expecting a detailed biography of the band, you'll be disappointed. However, for an enjoyable story that includes the highlights of the Doors' career, and many of their hits, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Great film!

    ***SPOILERS*** The true an tragic story of psychedelic rock music icon Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer, who together with his group "The Doors" went from the heights of Mt. Olympus to the depths of the Qattara Dpression in less then five years. It was in 1965 when Morrison was attending UCLA Film school that he had a revelation, helped by getting stoned on drugs, in the California Desert that he realized that his true calling was in music not film. Now back in civilization Morrison tried his hand on music and with three of his friends Ray Manzaredk Robbie Krieger & John Densmore, Kyle MacLachian Frank Whaley & Kevin Dillion, formed the rock group "The Doors" and the rest is rock & roll or hard rock history. It what seemed that like almost overnight Morrison's Doors became the most popular singing group in the US! Even eclipsing "The Beatles" & "Rolling Stones" in that they were home grown, born and raised in the USA, unlike their British counterparts. And what's more Jim Morrison & The Doors' music was far more original then any of the English groups. Who for the most part were only singing repackaged 1950's and early 1960's rock & roll bubble-gun music with English accents. It was at the hight of his popularity that Morrison's self-destructive qualities suddenly started to come to the surface. We get to see in the movie how Morrison began to drink and do drugs almost every hour of the day and night as he was preforming both on and off stage. His womanizing didn't help Morrison either in that he ran the risk of being sued in dozen of paternity suites from the women and young girls,as well as their outraged parents, that he engaged with . That lead to his life long woman companion Pamala Courson, Meg Ryan, becoming so depressed over Morrisons affairs, mostly with groupies, that she herself started turning to drugs on an almost daily basis! That ultimately lead to Pamala dying of an heroin overdose in 1974 at age 27. The same age that Morrison passed away from a suspected, no autopsy was preformed on his body, heroin overdose three years earlier! It was in 1969 at a concert in Miami that Morrison burnt out and a shell of his former self finally hit rock bottom and self destructed on stage in front of thousand of his fans. His once trim body bolted from beer & booze as well as being drunk and stoned out of his skull Morrison gave the performance of his life! That lead to his arrest on drug and morals, in exposing himself in public, charges that ended up putting him on ice or out of circulating form almost a year. Still Jim Morrison continued to live the kind of scuzzy and drug addictive life that had even his fellow Door members distance themselves and stopped talking to him. That's until he finally realized that his life won't last long with the damage it was doing to him both physically as well as mentally. In the early summer of 1971 Jim Morrison now trying to get his head back together and turn his already shattered life around traveled to Paris France together with Pamala to either write poetry or paint pictures. It was there that he ended up taking his last breath as well as suspected, but never proved, last mind altering drug trip. Waking up in the early morning of July 3, 1971 Morrison feeling ill and coughing up blood decided to take a hot bath in order to ease the pain. It was there that Pamala found him dead as a doornail a few hours later. Dead from the wild and crazy lifestyle that Jim Morrison lead that both immortalized as well as ended up killing him. P.S Check out the movie's director Oliver Stone as a film professor at the UCLA film school that Jim Morrison attended. There also the famed defense attorney William Kunstler playing himself as Jim Morrison's lawyer at his booze drug & indecent public exposer trail in Miami Florida.

    I never thought much of Val Kilmer, but after watching Oliver Stone's incredible biopic, The Doors, that perception has changed entirely. This is the ultimate story of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. Kilmer plays frontman of the famous 60's rock band The Doors, Jim Morrison. Morrison is a self absorbed, self destructive, self proclaimed poet whose experiences with drugs, sex, and music make him a fascinating mess of a man. Kilmer portrays him to perfection in one of the most immaculate and hypnotic biopics I've ever seen. I will be honest and say that I am pretty much going to enjoy any movie about rock and roll by default. The Commitments, Almost Famous, Pirate Radio, etc. All movies I love. But it doesn't mean that is the only reason I love this film. It is, however, a damn good reason. Stone's rendition of the 60's free love era is as haunting as it is captivating. The concert scenes in this film are astoundingly hypnotic because of the mesmerizing visuals and the dark engulfing Doors music playing so crisp and so beautifully. Kilmer did all of his own singing for this film and as the film progresses you start to wonder whether Morrison himself stepped in to play his own part. Kilmer looks and sounds just like the man. The concert bits of the film are Kilmer's vocals and the soundtrack itself is the original Morrison vocals, yet you could never tell the difference. This may have been the role Kilmer was born to play. At first I was worried I wouldn't like this film by the end because of the character of Jim Morrison. He is this ridiculously self-important, pompous douche that only speaks in poetry, calling himself the Lizard King and practically proclaiming himself as a prophet. But it is these bizarre beginnings that lead to the growth of his character into the self destructive, self loathing maniac we see in the last half of the film. Love him or hate him, he is a fascinating character and watching him grow and witnessing the chaos around him is so engaging and yet so frightening. Morrison, in this film, is the poster child for a man with no limitations. The way he destroys himself through drugs and alcohol is ugly, yet you cannot take your eyes off of it. Morrison's fascination with death and how it drives him to the brink of insanity, almost longing for death because it is the ultimate high, is such an asphyxiated tragedy. As much as we tell ourselves we don't, we long to see the levels this man will stoop to and just how far his psychotic nature will take him. The Doors is a film that satisfies our asphyxiation with tragedy and the unfortunate, while telling the story through such a hypnotic and overwhelming method. I've seen a lot of Oliver Stone films and they are all fantastic, but this one has to be my favorite, thus far. Jim Morrison is just such a deranged yet fascinating man whose story is so engaging and yet so bleak and misguided. There were so many things wrong with this man and this film exemplifies them all and develops the story through such a psychedelic medium. I consider this film a masterful work of art and one of the best biopics I've ever seen. At two hours and twenty minutes, not a second of this film is wasted and I never wanted it to end.

    The only reason I say that is because the movie really wasn't about the Doors and more about Jim Morrison. The excesses of a Man who really didn't wish to be famous for the things he was famous for(Good looks, Long hair Etc). He wished to be famous for the words he created. So the movie tells the story of the spirit of the sixties also the excesses. I just recently re watched this movie. I first saw it in theaters.Although I wasn't very familiar with the Doors I was intrigued and captivated by the portrayal of Jim Morrison. From the very beginning of Jim being in the car with his parents to each time after he is on the screen you almost could feel the heat that was building within this man. As if the Doors were just a backdrop to Jim's artistic masterpiece. I feel that Oliver Stone was simply paying tribute to the man who probably set him on his way movie making destiny. The wild concert scenes were interesting to see that concert going and the way people enjoy themselves at concerts has not changed much. I believed that the Doors were so short lived was because that the band or, Ray Manzarek put so much stock and interest into Jim Morrison's antics and profound words that they didn't pit much effort in making the music just as strong as the words. So in doing so the music became background instead of sharing the spotlight with the words. Do I think Oliver showed that? Well kinda, as in certain scenes he speaks on the division in the band. Such as when they were at Andy Warhol's party. Jim Morrison in this portrayal was simply again everybody but he was more against those that appreciated him than those who didn't. To him everything was a game something to be toyed with and see how far to the thresholds it can be pushed before it pushes back or breaks. Especially the woman in his life. Of course if you are familiar with the Doors you already know what Morrison's outcome was. But,I believe this movie gives more of an insight of just how tortured this soul was and how because of the whole "Free to be me" Sixties maybe if some kind of intervention was imposed we might still have Jim Morrison with us< But would that be a good thing, See the movie and then answer.

    This movie is just plain awesome. Val Kilmer BECAME Jim Morrison. The movie soundtrack is great, the acting is great and this is definitely one of Oliver Stone's best movies. I don't see how Val Kilmer wasn't up for an Academy Award, as he WAS Jim Morrison. No one else can portray Morrison the way Val Kilmer did. NO ONE. This is a must see for all Doors fans.The movie has a great amount of memorable scenes, such as the Warhol party, the desert trip and the blood ritual. Kilmer did a lot of his own singing and he did a great job. This is Val Kilmer's greatest movie ever. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10 stars. GO SEE IT!!

    this movie changed my life.... I being born much after the epoch of the Doors or in fact the whole psychedelic generation was gifted by such a fantastic movie that far outlives all the other attempts at cinematic brilliance of the time period..... wow I found some LSD and I ate it... and I loved the Doors!!! I love everything about this movie! It is Val Kilmers Opus Rex, It is Oliver Stone's Citizen Kane of the 60's... Jim Morrison was and will remain an enigma of that generation!!! His current tax woes make me want to scream "FUCK IT MOVE TO France" and let us start a secret society of Doors fanatics and American expatriats.

    I never thought much of Val Kilmer, but after watching Oliver Stone's incredible biopic, The Doors, that perception has changed entirely. This is the ultimate story of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. Kilmer plays frontman of the famous 60's rock band The Doors, Jim Morrison. Morrison is a self absorbed, self destructive, self proclaimed poet whose experiences with drugs, sex, and music make him a fascinating mess of a man. Kilmer portrays him to perfection in one of the most immaculate and hypnotic biopics I've ever seen. I will be honest and say that I am pretty much going to enjoy any movie about rock and roll by default. The Commitments, Almost Famous, Pirate Radio, etc. All movies I love.

I've seen a lot of Oliver Stone films and they are all fantastic, but this one has to be my favorite, thus far. Jim Morrison is just such a deranged yet fascinating man whose story is so engaging and yet so bleak and misguided. There were so many things wrong with this man and this film exemplifies them all and develops the story through such a psychedelic medium. I consider this film a masterful work of art and one of the best biopics I've ever seen. At two hours and twenty minutes, not a second of this film is wasted and I never wanted it to end.

    The only reason I say that is because the movie really wasn't about the Doors and more about Jim Morrison. The excesses of a Man who really didn't wish to be famous for the things he was famous for(Good looks, Long hair Etc). He wished to be famous for the words he created. So the movie tells the story of the spirit of the sixties also the excesses. I just recently re watched this movie. I first saw it in theaters.Although I wasn't very familiar with the Doors I was intrigued and captivated by the portrayal of Jim Morrison. From the very beginning of Jim being in the car with his parents to each time after he is on the screen you almost could feel the heat that was building within this man. As if the Doors were just a backdrop to Jim's artistic masterpiece. I feel that Oliver Stone was simply paying tribute to the man who probably set him on his way movie making destiny. The wild concert scenes were interesting to see that concert going and the way people enjoy themselves at concerts has not changed much. I believed that the Doors were so short lived was because that the band or, Ray Manzarek put so much stock and interest into Jim Morrison's antics and profound words that they didn't pit much effort in making the music just as strong as the words. So in doing so the music became background instead of sharing the spotlight with the words. Do I think Oliver showed that? Well kinda, as in certain scenes he speaks on the division in the band. Such as when they were at Andy Warhol's party. Jim Morrison in this portrayal was simply again everybody but he was more against those that appreciated him than those who didn't. To him everything was a game something to be toyed with and see how far to the thresholds it can be pushed before it pushes back or breaks. Especially the woman in his life. Of course if you are familiar with the Doors you already know what Morrison's outcome was. But,I believe this movie gives more of an insight of just how tortured this soul was and how because of the whole "Free to be me" Sixties maybe if some kind of intervention was imposed we might still have Jim Morrison with us< But would that be a good thing, See the movie and then answer.

    This movie is just plain awesome. Val Kilmer BECAME Jim Morrison. The movie soundtrack is great, the acting is great and this is definitely one of Oliver Stone's best movies. I don't see how Val Kilmer wasn't up for an Academy Award, as he WAS Jim Morrison. No one else can portray Morrison the way Val Kilmer did. NO ONE. This is a must see for all Doors fans.The movie has a great amount of memorable scenes, such as the Warhol party, the desert trip and the blood ritual. Kilmer did a lot of his own singing and he did a great job. This is Val Kilmer's greatest movie ever. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10 stars. GO SEE IT!!

    this movie changed my life.... I being born much after the epoch of the Doors or in fact the whole psychedelic generation was gifted by such a fantastic movie that far outlives all the other attempts at cinematic brilliance of the time period..... wow I found some LSD and I ate it... and I loved the Doors!!! I love everything about this movie! It is Val Kilmers Opus Rex, It is Oliver Stone's Citizen Kane of the 60's... Jim Morrison was and will remain an enigma of that generation!!! His current tax woes make me want to scream "FUCK IT MOVE TO France" and let us start a secret society of Doors fanatics and American expatriats.

    One of the very best films I've seen in a cinema. A brilliant trip through the late sixties in what was tag-lined The Ultimate Story Of Sex, Drugs And Rock'n'Roll. The cinematography is rich in mood and puts you right there among the experience. The soundtrack of Doors tracks is incredibly captivating. The Doors is not a factually-accurate account of the band's history and exploits, as said by many critics including the band's keyboard player Ray Manzarek. Nonetheless, it's a fabulous immersion into the feeling of the wild and hedonistic times the band passed through. Watch it and drown down into it...

    A lot of people (Ray Manzarek & Robby Krieger included... ) didn't like Oliver Stone's 'Doors' film, but I appreciated it, and it's one of the many movies I own. It's not just about the music, it does try to speculate about Jim's psychology as well, and whilst it may not be true, the blend of fact with hypotheses and outright myth does create an intoxicating aura that captures the spirit of what life might have been like during Jim's phase of intense drug use... Sections of it are really trippy, even though I've always watched it straight... so, if you like the idea of The Doors music blended with weird and evocative ideas, then it could well be your thing...

    First of all let me state that I am a HUGE fan of Jim Morrison and The Doors. I have read 5 biography's on Morrison himself, so when I watched this movie for the first time I compared it based off of the pre determined knowledge I gathered of Jim. With that said, let me state that this movie though entertaining and enjoyable should not be taken seriously as a Doors/Morrison biopic. The movie generally portrays only the bad side of Jim Morrison. The drunken babbling leather clad womanizer. However, show's very little of the sensitive, caring, intelligent poetic Morrison. If one were to watch this movie not knowing who Jim Morrison was they would probably walk away with the impression that he was the biggest asshole to ever walk the face of the earth. The movie spans from a time shortly before The Doors were conceived in 1966 all the way to Jim Morrison's untimely death on July 3rd 1971. The best things about this movie is the awesome soundtrack and Val Kilmers performance as Morrison was quite good. Kilmer himself did 90% of the singing for this movie and at times sounds quite close to Morrison's voice. With that said though this movie seems to be mostly Oliver Stones take on who he thought Jim Morrison was, and in his mind how The Doors were conceived. Though I don't think Oliver Stone made this movie with the intention of making Morrison look bad, he kind of did in nonchalant way. If you're like me and a fan of The Doors you'll probably either feel one of two ways about this movie...Either you will watch it and think that Oliver Stone was a total asshole to malportraying Jim Morrison and The Doors...Or you will be like me, and enjoying for being the semi fictional semi none fictional movie it is. If you are new to Jim Morrison and The Doors...DO NOT...I repeat DO NOT take this movie as fact. Much of the movie is Hollywood fiction and there is A lot of things left out about who The Doors were and how they started one of the greatest American rock/blues groups of the 1960s.

    This movie captures the music, the look, and the overall of the Doors through their relatively short career. Oliver Stone is impeccably true to the music and the look - the musical instruments are perfect and authentic, from Ray Manzarek's Vox Organ to Robby Krieger's Gibson guitar. Val Kilmer does an excellent job as Jim, as do the rest of the actors playing the Doors. The performances are believable and true to the essence of the band. The film spends little time on the writing process, with the exception of a highlight of the film, which is the birth of "Light My Fire". The focus is more on the mythology on the band and on Jim himself, the Lizard King. As a Doors' fan, I appreciated the film on many levels, and felt it really got the story right. If you're expecting a detailed biography of the band, you'll be disappointed. However, for an enjoyable story that includes the highlights of the Doors' career, and many of their hits, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Great film!

    ***SPOILERS*** The true an tragic story of psychedelic rock music icon Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer, who together with his group "The Doors" went from the heights of Mt. Olympus to the depths of the Qattara Dpression in less then five years. It was in 1965 when Morrison was attending UCLA Film school that he had a revelation, helped by getting stoned on drugs, in the California Desert that he realized that his true calling was in music not film. Now back in civilization Morrison tried his hand on music and with three of his friends Ray Manzaredk Robbie Krieger & John Densmore, Kyle MacLachian Frank Whaley & Kevin Dillion, formed the rock group "The Doors" and the rest is rock & roll or hard rock history. It what seemed that like almost overnight Morrison's Doors became the most popular singing group in the US! Even eclipsing "The Beatles" & "Rolling Stones" in that they were home grown, born and raised in the USA, unlike their British counterparts. And what's more Jim Morrison & The Doors' music was far more original then any of the English groups. Who for the most part were only singing repackaged 1950's and early 1960's rock & roll bubble-gun music with English accents. It was at the hight of his popularity that Morrison's self-destructive qualities suddenly started to come to the surface. We get to see in the movie how Morrison began to drink and do drugs almost every hour of the day and night as he was preforming both on and off stage. His womanizing didn't help Morrison either in that he ran the risk of being sued in dozen of paternity suites from the women and young girls,as well as their outraged parents, that he engaged with . That lead to his life long woman companion Pamala Courson, Meg Ryan, becoming so depressed over Morrisons affairs, mostly with groupies, that she herself started turning to drugs on an almost daily basis! That ultimately lead to Pamala dying of an heroin overdose in 1974 at age 27. The same age that Morrison passed away from a suspected, no autopsy was preformed on his body, heroin overdose three years earlier! It was in 1969 at a concert in Miami that Morrison burnt out and a shell of his former self finally hit rock bottom and self destructed on stage in front of thousand of his fans. His once trim body bolted from beer & booze as well as being drunk and stoned out of his skull Morrison gave the performance of his life! That lead to his arrest on drug and morals, in exposing himself in public, charges that ended up putting him on ice or out of circulating form almost a year. Still Jim Morrison continued to live the kind of scuzzy and drug addictive life that had even his fellow Door members distance themselves and stopped talking to him. That's until he finally realized that his life won't last long with the damage it was doing to him both physically as well as mentally. In the early summer of 1971 Jim Morrison now trying to get his head back together and turn his already shattered life around traveled to Paris France together with Pamala to either write poetry or paint pictures. It was there that he ended up taking his last breath as well as suspected, but never proved, last mind altering drug trip. Waking up in the early morning of July 3, 1971 Morrison feeling ill and coughing up blood decided to take a hot bath in order to ease the pain. It was there that Pamala found him dead as a doornail a few hours later. Dead from the wild and crazy lifestyle that Jim Morrison lead that both immortalized as well as ended up killing him. P.S Check out the movie's director Oliver Stone as a film professor at the UCLA film school that Jim Morrison attended. There also the famed defense attorney William Kunstler playing himself as Jim Morrison's lawyer at his booze drug & indecent public exposer trail in Miami Florida.

    I never thought much of Val Kilmer, but after watching Oliver Stone's incredible biopic, The Doors, that perception has changed entirely. This is the ultimate story of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. Kilmer plays frontman of the famous 60's rock band The Doors, Jim Morrison. Morrison is a self absorbed, self destructive, self proclaimed poet whose experiences with drugs, sex, and music make him a fascinating mess of a man. Kilmer portrays him to perfection in one of the most immaculate and hypnotic biopics I've ever seen. I will be honest and say that I am pretty much going to enjoy any movie about rock and roll by default. The Commitments, Almost Famous, Pirate Radio, etc. All movies I love. But it doesn't mean that is the only reason I love this film. It is, however, a damn good reason. Stone's rendition of the 60's free love era is as haunting as it is captivating. The concert scenes in this film are astoundingly hypnotic because of the mesmerizing visuals and the dark engulfing Doors music playing so crisp and so beautifully. Kilmer did all of his own singing for this film and as the film progresses you start to wonder whether Morrison himself stepped in to play his own part. Kilmer looks and sounds just like the man. The concert bits of the film are Kilmer's vocals and the soundtrack itself is the original Morrison vocals, yet you could never tell the difference. This may have been the role Kilmer was born to play. At first I was worried I wouldn't like this film by the end because of the character of Jim Morrison. He is this ridiculously self-important, pompous douche that only speaks in poetry, calling himself the Lizard King and practically proclaiming himself as a prophet. But it is these bizarre beginnings that lead to the growth of his character into the self destructive, self loathing maniac we see in the last half of the film. Love him or hate him, he is a fascinating character and watching him grow and witnessing the chaos around him is so engaging and yet so frightening. Morrison, in this film, is the poster child for a man with no limitations. The way he destroys himself through drugs and alcohol is ugly, yet you cannot take your eyes off of it. Morrison's fascination with death and how it drives him to the brink of insanity, almost longing for death because it is the ultimate high, is such an asphyxiated tragedy. As much as we tell ourselves we don't, we long to see the levels this man will stoop to and just how far his psychotic nature will take him. The Doors is a film that satisfies our asphyxiation with tragedy and the unfortunate, while telling the story through such a hypnotic and overwhelming method. I've seen a lot of Oliver Stone films and they are all fantastic, but this one has to be my favorite, thus far. Jim Morrison is just such a deranged yet fascinating man whose story is so engaging and yet so bleak and misguided. There were so many things wrong with this man and this film exemplifies them all and develops the story through such a psychedelic medium. I consider this film a masterful work of art and one of the best biopics I've ever seen. At two hours and twenty minutes, not a second of this film is wasted and I never wanted it to end.

Even eclipsing "The Beatles" & "Rolling Stones" in that they were home grown, born and raised in the USA, unlike their British counterparts. And what's more Jim Morrison & The Doors' music was far more original then any of the English groups. Who for the most part were only singing repackaged 1950's and early 1960's rock & roll bubble-gun music with English accents. It was at the hight of his popularity that Morrison's self-destructive qualities suddenly started to come to the surface. We get to see in the movie how Morrison began to drink and do drugs almost every hour of the day and night as he was preforming both on and off stage. His womanizing didn't help Morrison either in that he ran the risk of being sued in dozen of paternity suites from the women and young girls,as well as their outraged parents, that he engaged with . That lead to his life long woman companion Pamala Courson, Meg Ryan, becoming so depressed over Morrisons affairs, mostly with groupies, that she herself started turning to drugs on an almost daily basis! That ultimately lead to Pamala dying of an heroin overdose in 1974 at age 27. The same age that Morrison passed away from a suspected, no autopsy was preformed on his body, heroin overdose three years earlier! It was in 1969 at a concert in Miami that Morrison burnt out and a shell of his former self finally hit rock bottom and self destructed on stage in front of thousand of his fans. His once trim body bolted from beer & booze as well as being drunk and stoned out of his skull Morrison gave the performance of his life! That lead to his arrest on drug and morals, in exposing himself in public, charges that ended up putting him on ice or out of circulating form almost a year. Still Jim Morrison continued to live the kind of scuzzy and drug addictive life that had even his fellow Door members distance themselves and stopped talking to him. That's until he finally realized that his life won't last long with the damage it was doing to him both physically as well as mentally. In the early summer of 1971 Jim Morrison now trying to get his head back together and turn his already shattered life around traveled to Paris France together with Pamala to either write poetry or paint pictures. It was there that he ended up taking his last breath as well as suspected, but never proved, last mind altering drug trip. Waking up in the early morning of July 3, 1971 Morrison feeling ill and coughing up blood decided to take a hot bath in order to ease the pain. It was there that Pamala found him dead as a doornail a few hours later. Dead from the wild and crazy lifestyle that Jim Morrison lead that both immortalized as well as ended up killing him. P.S Check out the movie's director Oliver Stone as a film professor at the UCLA film school that Jim Morrison attended. There also the famed defense attorney William Kunstler playing himself as Jim Morrison's lawyer at his booze drug & indecent public exposer trail in Miami Florida.

    I never thought much of Val Kilmer, but after watching Oliver Stone's incredible biopic, The Doors, that perception has changed entirely. This is the ultimate story of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. Kilmer plays frontman of the famous 60's rock band The Doors, Jim Morrison. Morrison is a self absorbed, self destructive, self proclaimed poet whose experiences with drugs, sex, and music make him a fascinating mess of a man. Kilmer portrays him to perfection in one of the most immaculate and hypnotic biopics I've ever seen. I will be honest and say that I am pretty much going to enjoy any movie about rock and roll by default. The Commitments, Almost Famous, Pirate Radio, etc. All movies I love. But it doesn't mean that is the only reason I love this film. It is, however, a damn good reason. Stone's rendition of the 60's free love era is as haunting as it is captivating. The concert scenes in this film are astoundingly hypnotic because of the mesmerizing visuals and the dark engulfing Doors music playing so crisp and so beautifully. Kilmer did all of his own singing for this film and as the film progresses you start to wonder whether Morrison himself stepped in to play his own part. Kilmer looks and sounds just like the man. The concert bits of the film are Kilmer's vocals and the soundtrack itself is the original Morrison vocals, yet you could never tell the difference. This may have been the role Kilmer was born to play. At first I was worried I wouldn't like this film by the end because of the character of Jim Morrison. He is this ridiculously self-important, pompous douche that only speaks in poetry, calling himself the Lizard King and practically proclaiming himself as a prophet. But it is these bizarre beginnings that lead to the growth of his character into the self destructive, self loathing maniac we see in the last half of the film. Love him or hate him, he is a fascinating character and watching him grow and witnessing the chaos around him is so engaging and yet so frightening. Morrison, in this film, is the poster child for a man with no limitations. The way he destroys himself through drugs and alcohol is ugly, yet you cannot take your eyes off of it. Morrison's fascination with death and how it drives him to the brink of insanity, almost longing for death because it is the ultimate high, is such an asphyxiated tragedy. As much as we tell ourselves we don't, we long to see the levels this man will stoop to and just how far his psychotic nature will take him. The Doors is a film that satisfies our asphyxiation with tragedy and the unfortunate, while telling the story through such a hypnotic and overwhelming method. I've seen a lot of Oliver Stone films and they are all fantastic, but this one has to be my favorite, thus far. Jim Morrison is just such a deranged yet fascinating man whose story is so engaging and yet so bleak and misguided. There were so many things wrong with this man and this film exemplifies them all and develops the story through such a psychedelic medium. I consider this film a masterful work of art and one of the best biopics I've ever seen. At two hours and twenty minutes, not a second of this film is wasted and I never wanted it to end.

    The only reason I say that is because the movie really wasn't about the Doors and more about Jim Morrison. The excesses of a Man who really didn't wish to be famous for the things he was famous for(Good looks, Long hair Etc). He wished to be famous for the words he created. So the movie tells the story of the spirit of the sixties also the excesses. I just recently re watched this movie. I first saw it in theaters.Although I wasn't very familiar with the Doors I was intrigued and captivated by the portrayal of Jim Morrison. From the very beginning of Jim being in the car with his parents to each time after he is on the screen you almost could feel the heat that was building within this man. As if the Doors were just a backdrop to Jim's artistic masterpiece. I feel that Oliver Stone was simply paying tribute to the man who probably set him on his way movie making destiny. The wild concert scenes were interesting to see that concert going and the way people enjoy themselves at concerts has not changed much. I believed that the Doors were so short lived was because that the band or, Ray Manzarek put so much stock and interest into Jim Morrison's antics and profound words that they didn't pit much effort in making the music just as strong as the words. So in doing so the music became background instead of sharing the spotlight with the words. Do I think Oliver showed that? Well kinda, as in certain scenes he speaks on the division in the band. Such as when they were at Andy Warhol's party. Jim Morrison in this portrayal was simply again everybody but he was more against those that appreciated him than those who didn't. To him everything was a game something to be toyed with and see how far to the thresholds it can be pushed before it pushes back or breaks. Especially the woman in his life. Of course if you are familiar with the Doors you already know what Morrison's outcome was. But,I believe this movie gives more of an insight of just how tortured this soul was and how because of the whole "Free to be me" Sixties maybe if some kind of intervention was imposed we might still have Jim Morrison with us< But would that be a good thing, See the movie and then answer.

    This movie is just plain awesome. Val Kilmer BECAME Jim Morrison. The movie soundtrack is great, the acting is great and this is definitely one of Oliver Stone's best movies. I don't see how Val Kilmer wasn't up for an Academy Award, as he WAS Jim Morrison. No one else can portray Morrison the way Val Kilmer did. NO ONE. This is a must see for all Doors fans.The movie has a great amount of memorable scenes, such as the Warhol party, the desert trip and the blood ritual. Kilmer did a lot of his own singing and he did a great job. This is Val Kilmer's greatest movie ever. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10 stars. GO SEE IT!!

    this movie changed my life.... I being born much after the epoch of the Doors or in fact the whole psychedelic generation was gifted by such a fantastic movie that far outlives all the other attempts at cinematic brilliance of the time period..... wow I found some LSD and I ate it... and I loved the Doors!!! I love everything about this movie! It is Val Kilmers Opus Rex, It is Oliver Stone's Citizen Kane of the 60's... Jim Morrison was and will remain an enigma of that generation!!! His current tax woes make me want to scream "FUCK IT MOVE TO France" and let us start a secret society of Doors fanatics and American expatriats.

    One of the very best films I've seen in a cinema. A brilliant trip through the late sixties in what was tag-lined The Ultimate Story Of Sex, Drugs And Rock'n'Roll. The cinematography is rich in mood and puts you right there among the experience. The soundtrack of Doors tracks is incredibly captivating. The Doors is not a factually-accurate account of the band's history and exploits, as said by many critics including the band's keyboard player Ray Manzarek. Nonetheless, it's a fabulous immersion into the feeling of the wild and hedonistic times the band passed through. Watch it and drown down into it...

    A lot of people (Ray Manzarek & Robby Krieger included... ) didn't like Oliver Stone's 'Doors' film, but I appreciated it, and it's one of the many movies I own. It's not just about the music, it does try to speculate about Jim's psychology as well, and whilst it may not be true, the blend of fact with hypotheses and outright myth does create an intoxicating aura that captures the spirit of what life might have been like during Jim's phase of intense drug use... Sections of it are really trippy, even though I've always watched it straight... so, if you like the idea of The Doors music blended with weird and evocative ideas, then it could well be your thing...

    First of all let me state that I am a HUGE fan of Jim Morrison and The Doors. I have read 5 biography's on Morrison himself, so when I watched this movie for the first time I compared it based off of the pre determined knowledge I gathered of Jim. With that said, let me state that this movie though entertaining and enjoyable should not be taken seriously as a Doors/Morrison biopic. The movie generally portrays only the bad side of Jim Morrison. The drunken babbling leather clad womanizer. However, show's very little of the sensitive, caring, intelligent poetic Morrison. If one were to watch this movie not knowing who Jim Morrison was they would probably walk away with the impression that he was the biggest asshole to ever walk the face of the earth. The movie spans from a time shortly before The Doors were conceived in 1966 all the way to Jim Morrison's untimely death on July 3rd 1971. The best things about this movie is the awesome soundtrack and Val Kilmers performance as Morrison was quite good. Kilmer himself did 90% of the singing for this movie and at times sounds quite close to Morrison's voice. With that said though this movie seems to be mostly Oliver Stones take on who he thought Jim Morrison was, and in his mind how The Doors were conceived. Though I don't think Oliver Stone made this movie with the intention of making Morrison look bad, he kind of did in nonchalant way. If you're like me and a fan of The Doors you'll probably either feel one of two ways about this movie...Either you will watch it and think that Oliver Stone was a total asshole to malportraying Jim Morrison and The Doors...Or you will be like me, and enjoying for being the semi fictional semi none fictional movie it is. If you are new to Jim Morrison and The Doors...DO NOT...I repeat DO NOT take this movie as fact. Much of the movie is Hollywood fiction and there is A lot of things left out about who The Doors were and how they started one of the greatest American rock/blues groups of the 1960s.

    This movie captures the music, the look, and the overall of the Doors through their relatively short career. Oliver Stone is impeccably true to the music and the look - the musical instruments are perfect and authentic, from Ray Manzarek's Vox Organ to Robby Krieger's Gibson guitar. Val Kilmer does an excellent job as Jim, as do the rest of the actors playing the Doors. The performances are believable and true to the essence of the band. The film spends little time on the writing process, with the exception of a highlight of the film, which is the birth of "Light My Fire". The focus is more on the mythology on the band and on Jim himself, the Lizard King. As a Doors' fan, I appreciated the film on many levels, and felt it really got the story right. If you're expecting a detailed biography of the band, you'll be disappointed. However, for an enjoyable story that includes the highlights of the Doors' career, and many of their hits, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Great film!

    ***SPOILERS*** The true an tragic story of psychedelic rock music icon Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer, who together with his group "The Doors" went from the heights of Mt. Olympus to the depths of the Qattara Dpression in less then five years. It was in 1965 when Morrison was attending UCLA Film school that he had a revelation, helped by getting stoned on drugs, in the California Desert that he realized that his true calling was in music not film. Now back in civilization Morrison tried his hand on music and with three of his friends Ray Manzaredk Robbie Krieger & John Densmore, Kyle MacLachian Frank Whaley & Kevin Dillion, formed the rock group "The Doors" and the rest is rock & roll or hard rock history. It what seemed that like almost overnight Morrison's Doors became the most popular singing group in the US! Even eclipsing "The Beatles" & "Rolling Stones" in that they were home grown, born and raised in the USA, unlike their British counterparts. And what's more Jim Morrison & The Doors' music was far more original then any of the English groups. Who for the most part were only singing repackaged 1950's and early 1960's rock & roll bubble-gun music with English accents.

We get to see in the movie how Morrison began to drink and do drugs almost every hour of the day and night as he was preforming both on and off stage. His womanizing didn't help Morrison either in that he ran the risk of being sued in dozen of paternity suites from the women and young girls,as well as their outraged parents, that he engaged with . That lead to his life long woman companion Pamala Courson, Meg Ryan, becoming so depressed over Morrisons affairs, mostly with groupies, that she herself started turning to drugs on an almost daily basis! That ultimately lead to Pamala dying of an heroin overdose in 1974 at age 27. The same age that Morrison passed away from a suspected, no autopsy was preformed on his body, heroin overdose three years earlier!
