    This is an oldie but a goldie! I remembered watching this when it first came out (I must have been 10 years old) and I always liked it. It is always interesting when you re-watch a movie because it is almost like you have never watched it before! It is that new of an experience, I didn't really remember much of it. The brother and sister duo were so fearless, and the visuals were really beautiful, plus the polar bear was so cute! A nice relaxing film I watched the other evening before bed - however I tossed and turned all night for some reason...maybe I was scared of the poachers! All in all a great family film but I would actually caution against showing it to some children as there are a few scary scenes especially dealing with those pesky pachers!

    Ever wonder what it's like to travel through Alaska? If you're curious, now you can experience the magnitude of the scenery that is Alaska by watching this film. The movie Alaska, is a family adventure film that involves two children, Jesse and Sean Barnes on the hunt to find their lost father. How did he get lost? As a pilot, the kids' father, Jake Barnes (Dirk Benedict) flies straight into a storm and crash lands into a mountain where he struggles to survive as his children look to find him. It's amazing because even when the story is not revolving around the adventurous children, the scenery everywhere is so beautiful. This is one of the strong points of this film. Another key part to this movie is a polar bear cub that runs into the Barnes kids and ends up trying to help locate their dad. This bear cub always reminds me of the polar bears from those coke commercials. Besides of what I think it could belong to, he is very cuddly looking. I'm also curious to how director Fraser Heston was able to get this animal to cooperate. I'm sure it's not easy to tame a wild animal. This cub must have been pre-trained some how. To make things even more interesting, poachers are on the move as well. Yes, there are other things on the hunt than the Barnes kids. So what are these guys looking for? If you're thinking the polar bear cub, you're absolutely right! So there are two conflicts here, Jesse and Sean have to find their father AND protect the bear cub from the dangerous poachers. The plot thickens! Many times while watching this movie I was on the edge of my seat because there were many moments of tension. These kinds of situations are brought up when many of the characters are involved with heights. Because a lot of Alaska is made of mountains, many of the scenes in this movie include climbing up steep hills and sailing across cold running rivers. Some scenes can be really gripping due to the slightest movement a character makes on screen. It is that suspenseful. Alaska is a wholesome adventure for both young and old. It's tale of courage and persistence is what keeps the audience watching from the scenic backgrounds to the most intense moments of conflict.

    Average family fare has the face man (Benedict) a pilot and widowed father to two teenage kids, one of whom is struggling with the transition to manhood, manifest in his strained relationship with his father and general disaffection for his adopted home of Alaska. Benedict sets out on a late-evening flight as wild weather approaches, and predictably, his plane crashes leaving his kids potential orphans. Not content to accept the presumed verdict, his kids mount a life or death mission through the Alaskan wilderness to locate their father, with a curious polar bear cub leading their way, and a pair of poachers on their trail. Heston's son directs this formulaic adventure tale with glorious scenery and cinematography and a few reasonable stunts involving wild river rapids, and precarious mountain climbs. Heston is uncharacteristically low-key, mainly a background character, although he does command the more grandiose dialogue and manages to snare most of the one-liners. Like him or loathe him, he's understated and his presence has little overall impact on the quality of the film, other than to give his son's film a marquee headline. The hallmarks of "Call of the Wild" and "White Fang" are present, the polar bear cub is cute-as-a-button, and Tootoosis' sage advice on human interaction with the local ecology, gives the film a conservation quality that is appropriate for the kids. Obviously it's clich&eacute;d and predictable with few surprises, but if you're after a sincere family friendly film the kids can comfortably watch under limited supervision, then the Hestons' "Alaska" should tick the box.

    If you put A-team's Face, A future b-movie sex icon, and Ben-hur's...Ben-hur together, what do you have? the one and only Alaska. 6 months before, Jake barne's family had a great life in Chicago, until the fateful day that his wife died. then, he and his remaining family, Sean and Jessie Barnes, moved to Alaska to start a new life. while Sean is reluctant to the idea, the family moves anyways, and Sean immediately wants to return to the windy city. so, Jake takes advantage of his pilot's license and becomes a bush pilot, while Jessie and Sean do whatever they feel like. So Jessie goes kayaking, dating a local native boy, and spends her time doing things a person in Alaska might do, while Sean spends his time playing street fighter: The movie arcade game at the local store. this is pretty much where the movie begins. This movie, in my opinion, was very good. aside from a family that loved each other, it sported some awesome camera views and great scenery. unlike Grizzly mountain, which had next to no good acting or anything, except for scenery, this movie had decent acting. some parts were as cheesy as a pizza, but it was at least entertaining. Unfortunately, i don't recall this movie being promoted as a classic or anything like that. which is disappointing because this movie is worthy of that, unlike some of the trash we're all fed these days that gets too much promotion. and just like the cover says, it all leads up to a real cliffhanger. while other cliffhangers might make you laugh (Ultraviolet ring any bells?) this one will have you on the edge of your seat. 8/10

    I watched this film when I was (where else?) in Alaska. I was eleven at the time. My sister and I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. I saw more holes in the plot of this film than I care to say, although I think one deserves special mention. When the younger sister is forced to hold up the two older males, I had to stop watching. For all those people who justify this film by saying that is "for kids", you are wrong. No one should have to suffer through this film. This makes "cheaper by the dozen" look sophisticated. I admit the the scenery in this film is nice. But scenery should not be the only reason for watching a movie. The plot is thin, the characters are annoying, not to mention stupid. I'm a city person, and even I know that travelling in a boat repaired with duct tape is a bad idea. The bear was cute, but became annoying as the movie wore on. To sum up, even mere children can see the rediculousness of this corny, horrible film.

    The Alaska scenery in this movie is spectacular and varies: sea, rivers, mountains, snow, rock, skies, shot with sweeping helicopter and crane shots. But the soundtrack is embarrassing: like something out of the Ten Commandments, great blaring trumpets, soaring strings, Tibetan bass horns, South American flutes, tom toms, fanfares, all preposterously overblown like something of a bygone era. It was seriously distracting. The dialog is silly, like something out of 50's cowboy and Indian dramas e.g. "Trust the bear" and "Dad, can we keep him?" The movie has no subtlety. Everything is spelled out with the explicitness of a TV sitcom. The plot is utterly improbable, with various anomalies that distress, like packing no more than a sandwich for a four day hike without it turning into a problem. Even the bear finds a adoptive mother, something that never happens in real life. No bad guys were harmed in the making of this movie. Cubby the orphaned polar bear cub is the star of the show, sort of like Wookie in Star Trek, who repeatedly saves the day from the evil poachers. It is a bit like the old Rin Tin Tin adventures, only Cubby is much cuter. However, the movie far from boring. I could not help but fear for the actors creating the film because they do so many dangerous stunts. Kids or adults without problems suspending disbelief will most enjoy this film.

    The cinematography is very good in this movie they did a good job at the scenery. The acting is good and its safe to take a family to see this movie. If you are an action adventure movie fan this isn't a movie for you. The plot was pretty weak. I don't know why the poachers were in the movie in the first place they just didn't tie into the movie very well. I guess the only reason charlston heston was in this movie is because the director is his son. I think children under ten would enjoy this movie it seemed like it was geared more for a child audience. If you are a action adventure fan you wont like it at all.So if you have a family this is a movie for you.

    I was not disappointed in this film; basically I knew going in what it would be, very formulaic. My only real gripe is the bear helping at the end - that was just too much. Well, the entire movie was a stretch in reality, but pulling on the rope was even too much for my kids to accept. Also, when they got the dad over the cliff, he was barely up there and they started hugging. My wise seven year old said "They shouldn't be so close to the edge when they do that." We then imagined a different ending to the movie: bear rescues family, family hugs for joy, whoa....AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! they go tumbling to their deaths, and the final shot is of the bear, looking over the edge... Good cheesy family flick. Not one I'm going to keep, but I don't feel cheated by watching it. I would be surprised if the kids ask to see it again.

    I lived in Alaska all my life. I find this a laugh. This is just another Hollywood rendition of Alaska for kids. For a Polar Bear to travel through the forest, to the mountains, near a river, and help a couple kids all throughout. A true laughter. However, I do make the comment that my dog certainly liked this movie, he watched the whole thing. A little Cessna crashing into the mountain tops? The pilot still manages to be alive after that...hearing word of this, the two inexperienced, poorly dressed kids go and save their father. Personally, I wish that this movie was never created at all. By all means, if you have little kids and want them to get wrong ideas about Alaska, then go ahead and let them watch this.

    Alaska is one of those films that is just there. There is nothing groundbreaking involved in it, but there is nothing offensive about it either. Directed by Fraser Clark Heston, Alaska tells the story of a father, Jake (Dirk Benedict), and his two kids, who lived in the lower 48 states until Jake's wife died and the family moves to Alaska, for the reason of making this movie it looks like. If the director's name looks vaguely familiar, it's because Fraser's daddy is an actor named Charlton, who also plays a polar bear poacher (imagine that, Charlton Heston wielding a gun, what are the odds?). Jake flies airplanes, and of course on one of his trips, the plane goes down, and it is up to his two kids Jessie (Thora Birch) and Sean (Vincent Kartheiser) to find him. With the help of a baby polar bear, the kids go out into the Alaskan wilderness, meet bear poachers, Eskimos, and other fun things. Alaska is an OK movie, nothing that will make you wish you hadn't seen it, just don't expect the Ten Commandments.

    This is an oldie but a goldie! I remembered watching this when it first came out (I must have been 10 years old) and I always liked it. It is always interesting when you re-watch a movie because it is almost like you have never watched it before! It is that new of an experience, I didn't really remember much of it. The brother and sister duo were so fearless, and the visuals were really beautiful, plus the polar bear was so cute! A nice relaxing film I watched the other evening before bed - however I tossed and turned all night for some reason...maybe I was scared of the poachers! All in all a great family film but I would actually caution against showing it to some children as there are a few scary scenes especially dealing with those pesky pachers!

    Ever wonder what it's like to travel through Alaska? If you're curious, now you can experience the magnitude of the scenery that is Alaska by watching this film. The movie Alaska, is a family adventure film that involves two children, Jesse and Sean Barnes on the hunt to find their lost father. How did he get lost? As a pilot, the kids' father, Jake Barnes (Dirk Benedict) flies straight into a storm and crash lands into a mountain where he struggles to survive as his children look to find him. It's amazing because even when the story is not revolving around the adventurous children, the scenery everywhere is so beautiful. This is one of the strong points of this film. Another key part to this movie is a polar bear cub that runs into the Barnes kids and ends up trying to help locate their dad. This bear cub always reminds me of the polar bears from those coke commercials. Besides of what I think it could belong to, he is very cuddly looking. I'm also curious to how director Fraser Heston was able to get this animal to cooperate. I'm sure it's not easy to tame a wild animal. This cub must have been pre-trained some how. To make things even more interesting, poachers are on the move as well. Yes, there are other things on the hunt than the Barnes kids. So what are these guys looking for? If you're thinking the polar bear cub, you're absolutely right! So there are two conflicts here, Jesse and Sean have to find their father AND protect the bear cub from the dangerous poachers. The plot thickens! Many times while watching this movie I was on the edge of my seat because there were many moments of tension. These kinds of situations are brought up when many of the characters are involved with heights. Because a lot of Alaska is made of mountains, many of the scenes in this movie include climbing up steep hills and sailing across cold running rivers. Some scenes can be really gripping due to the slightest movement a character makes on screen. It is that suspenseful. Alaska is a wholesome adventure for both young and old. It's tale of courage and persistence is what keeps the audience watching from the scenic backgrounds to the most intense moments of conflict.

    Average family fare has the face man (Benedict) a pilot and widowed father to two teenage kids, one of whom is struggling with the transition to manhood, manifest in his strained relationship with his father and general disaffection for his adopted home of Alaska. Benedict sets out on a late-evening flight as wild weather approaches, and predictably, his plane crashes leaving his kids potential orphans. Not content to accept the presumed verdict, his kids mount a life or death mission through the Alaskan wilderness to locate their father, with a curious polar bear cub leading their way, and a pair of poachers on their trail. Heston's son directs this formulaic adventure tale with glorious scenery and cinematography and a few reasonable stunts involving wild river rapids, and precarious mountain climbs. Heston is uncharacteristically low-key, mainly a background character, although he does command the more grandiose dialogue and manages to snare most of the one-liners. Like him or loathe him, he's understated and his presence has little overall impact on the quality of the film, other than to give his son's film a marquee headline. The hallmarks of "Call of the Wild" and "White Fang" are present, the polar bear cub is cute-as-a-button, and Tootoosis' sage advice on human interaction with the local ecology, gives the film a conservation quality that is appropriate for the kids. Obviously it's clich&eacute;d and predictable with few surprises, but if you're after a sincere family friendly film the kids can comfortably watch under limited supervision, then the Hestons' "Alaska" should tick the box.

    If you put A-team's Face, A future b-movie sex icon, and Ben-hur's...Ben-hur together, what do you have? the one and only Alaska. 6 months before, Jake barne's family had a great life in Chicago, until the fateful day that his wife died. then, he and his remaining family, Sean and Jessie Barnes, moved to Alaska to start a new life. while Sean is reluctant to the idea, the family moves anyways, and Sean immediately wants to return to the windy city. so, Jake takes advantage of his pilot's license and becomes a bush pilot, while Jessie and Sean do whatever they feel like. So Jessie goes kayaking, dating a local native boy, and spends her time doing things a person in Alaska might do, while Sean spends his time playing street fighter: The movie arcade game at the local store. this is pretty much where the movie begins. This movie, in my opinion, was very good. aside from a family that loved each other, it sported some awesome camera views and great scenery. unlike Grizzly mountain, which had next to no good acting or anything, except for scenery, this movie had decent acting. some parts were as cheesy as a pizza, but it was at least entertaining. Unfortunately, i don't recall this movie being promoted as a classic or anything like that. which is disappointing because this movie is worthy of that, unlike some of the trash we're all fed these days that gets too much promotion. and just like the cover says, it all leads up to a real cliffhanger. while other cliffhangers might make you laugh (Ultraviolet ring any bells?) this one will have you on the edge of your seat. 8/10

    I watched this film when I was (where else?) in Alaska. I was eleven at the time. My sister and I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. I saw more holes in the plot of this film than I care to say, although I think one deserves special mention. When the younger sister is forced to hold up the two older males, I had to stop watching. For all those people who justify this film by saying that is "for kids", you are wrong. No one should have to suffer through this film. This makes "cheaper by the dozen" look sophisticated. I admit the the scenery in this film is nice. But scenery should not be the only reason for watching a movie. The plot is thin, the characters are annoying, not to mention stupid. I'm a city person, and even I know that travelling in a boat repaired with duct tape is a bad idea. The bear was cute, but became annoying as the movie wore on. To sum up, even mere children can see the rediculousness of this corny, horrible film.

    The Alaska scenery in this movie is spectacular and varies: sea, rivers, mountains, snow, rock, skies, shot with sweeping helicopter and crane shots. But the soundtrack is embarrassing: like something out of the Ten Commandments, great blaring trumpets, soaring strings, Tibetan bass horns, South American flutes, tom toms, fanfares, all preposterously overblown like something of a bygone era. It was seriously distracting. The dialog is silly, like something out of 50's cowboy and Indian dramas e.g. "Trust the bear" and "Dad, can we keep him?" The movie has no subtlety. Everything is spelled out with the explicitness of a TV sitcom. The plot is utterly improbable, with various anomalies that distress, like packing no more than a sandwich for a four day hike without it turning into a problem. Even the bear finds a adoptive mother, something that never happens in real life. No bad guys were harmed in the making of this movie. Cubby the orphaned polar bear cub is the star of the show, sort of like Wookie in Star Trek, who repeatedly saves the day from the evil poachers. It is a bit like the old Rin Tin Tin adventures, only Cubby is much cuter. However, the movie far from boring. I could not help but fear for the actors creating the film because they do so many dangerous stunts. Kids or adults without problems suspending disbelief will most enjoy this film.

    The cinematography is very good in this movie they did a good job at the scenery. The acting is good and its safe to take a family to see this movie. If you are an action adventure movie fan this isn't a movie for you. The plot was pretty weak. I don't know why the poachers were in the movie in the first place they just didn't tie into the movie very well. I guess the only reason charlston heston was in this movie is because the director is his son. I think children under ten would enjoy this movie it seemed like it was geared more for a child audience. If you are a action adventure fan you wont like it at all.So if you have a family this is a movie for you.

    I was not disappointed in this film; basically I knew going in what it would be, very formulaic. My only real gripe is the bear helping at the end - that was just too much. Well, the entire movie was a stretch in reality, but pulling on the rope was even too much for my kids to accept. Also, when they got the dad over the cliff, he was barely up there and they started hugging. My wise seven year old said "They shouldn't be so close to the edge when they do that." We then imagined a different ending to the movie: bear rescues family, family hugs for joy, whoa....AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! they go tumbling to their deaths, and the final shot is of the bear, looking over the edge... Good cheesy family flick. Not one I'm going to keep, but I don't feel cheated by watching it. I would be surprised if the kids ask to see it again.

    I lived in Alaska all my life. I find this a laugh. This is just another Hollywood rendition of Alaska for kids. For a Polar Bear to travel through the forest, to the mountains, near a river, and help a couple kids all throughout. A true laughter. However, I do make the comment that my dog certainly liked this movie, he watched the whole thing. A little Cessna crashing into the mountain tops? The pilot still manages to be alive after that...hearing word of this, the two inexperienced, poorly dressed kids go and save their father. Personally, I wish that this movie was never created at all. By all means, if you have little kids and want them to get wrong ideas about Alaska, then go ahead and let them watch this.

    Alaska is one of those films that is just there. There is nothing groundbreaking involved in it, but there is nothing offensive about it either. Directed by Fraser Clark Heston, Alaska tells the story of a father, Jake (Dirk Benedict), and his two kids, who lived in the lower 48 states until Jake's wife died and the family moves to Alaska, for the reason of making this movie it looks like. If the director's name looks vaguely familiar, it's because Fraser's daddy is an actor named Charlton, who also plays a polar bear poacher (imagine that, Charlton Heston wielding a gun, what are the odds?). Jake flies airplanes, and of course on one of his trips, the plane goes down, and it is up to his two kids Jessie (Thora Birch) and Sean (Vincent Kartheiser) to find him. With the help of a baby polar bear, the kids go out into the Alaskan wilderness, meet bear poachers, Eskimos, and other fun things. Alaska is an OK movie, nothing that will make you wish you hadn't seen it, just don't expect the Ten Commandments.
