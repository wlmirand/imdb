    The only reason this movie was made is probably to satisfy Seagal's huge ego . THE WHOLE MOVIE is basically a non stop marathon about how Seagal's character is awesome , tough , smart , handsome and bla bla bla bla . Someone here needs a therapy  Anyway , that's the biggest problem of the movie . I quickly became annoyed with all this Seagal worship that doesn't end until the ending credits appear. Even sticking to well liked by audiences formula of buddy cop movie isn't able to save the movie . Maybe because Wayans isn't one bit funny. "The Glimmer man" tries to have a dark atmosphere like "Se7en" , but fails . Not to mention that the whole movie feels low budget made for  TV movie . In the end the movie makers tried desperately to impress the audience at least with violence , yet it comes out like a cheap shock. Story ? What story ? Action ? Typical unimpressive Seagal style. Avoid it . I give it 1/10.

    A practicing-Buddhist detective (Steven Seagal) joins forces with a wise-cracking, LA cop (Damon Wayans) on the cases of a serial killer called The Family Man who intrudes on the homes of families, shooting them in the foreheads point blank (the gun, equipped with silencer), then displaying them in the ritualistic form of the Crucifix, spiked to their bedroom walls. Soon, however, Seagal realizes that certain murders might be imitations, meant to resemble those of The Family Man, in actuality tied to chemical weapons smuggled and meant for sale to terrorists. Wayans loses his home, and suffers great harm to his person, thanks to his association with Seagal. I did think I would like this a little more than I did. Sure, Seagal has the requisite fight scene where he hurls men through tables, across the bar, through windows, and crashing into displays and walls, with broken bottles and faces as a result. There's a treasure of villainy, including Brian Cox as a CIA government man from Seagal's past, Bob Gunton (Shawshank Redemption) as the one responsible for negotiating the weapons trade with the Russian mob, Stephen Tobolowsky as The Family Man (who Seagal must kill in a Catholic Church much to his dismay after repeated warnings), and John M Jackson as Gunton's enforcer soon turning on his boss. Jackson is the unfortunate final bad guy and the eventual recipient of a major ass-whooping. I honestly think the feeling of familiarity with the plot and action scenes (the serial killing subplot shows us some grisly crime scenes but the approach to solving them is uninspired; this is more about the--yawn-- weapons smuggling uncovering than removing a serial killer from the streets) hurts The Glimmer Man. Yes, faces are beaten to a bloody and battered pulp, and Seagal's hands still move at warp speed when he destroys his foes, but I found myself just wanting more this time around. Wayans tries to use his sense of humor to save the day, and Seagal looks as relaxed and comfortable as I have ever seen him; but, the film simply lacks grit and intensity (there's also that energy missing) needed considering what the heroes are up against. This is a good example of the beginnings in Seagal's action hero decline. This was also a glaring example of Seagal's continuing chunky physique; I'm not one to harp on this as some do, but his limited movement does deter from the authenticity of his fight scenes...that said, at least he can absorb extra punishment and move more than one man around without it seeming less realistic.

    The latest Steven Seagal crime movie "The Glimmer Man" takes its title from the hero's dexterity and cunning at eliminating his foes before they can retaliate. Devoted fans of the real-life Aikido master will cheer their pony-tail hero as he demolishes his usual quota of thuggish villains who richly deserve every slap, smack, punch, and crackle they receive from Seagal as a way of atonement. What might upset them are the many variations that embellish this saga. No, "The Glimmer Man" isn't a message-laden, ecological nightmare that Seagal's earlier epic "On Deadly Ground" was. This Seagal vehicle grafts a creepy, whodunit, serial killer plot reminiscent of the 1995 Brad Pitt chiller "Se7en" onto a standard-issue police procedural. This time out we're allowed to laugh a little at the antics of Seagal and his newest sidekick, LAPD Detective Jim Campbell (Keenen Ivory Wayans of "A Lone Down Dirty Shame"), who gets to be the butt of our protagonist's pranks. The script allows Wayans to behave in a fashion that would appear inappropriate for the screen persona of Seagal's indestructible character. For instance, we get to see Wayans cry like a baby as he watches "Casablanca" in a downtown movie palace. Seagal's recent pictures have been overshadowed by his 1992 box office smash "Under Siege." "The Glimmer Man" represents an appeal to a more broadly defined audience, but nevertheless, it is more a watchable than most of his far-fetched fare. Steven Seagal's "Glimmer Man" character Jack Cole replicates the cop that he played in his cinematic debut "Hard to Kill" 9(1988) who had a hazy background as a CIA agent. Here, Seagal plays an ex-CIA assassin who plied his trade during the Vietnam War. As usual, Cole suffered from the lone wolf, "Dirty Harry," syndrome. Mystery cloaks Cole so thoroughly that Campbell (Wayans) cannot decide whether to trust him or arrest him. Gradually, our detective heroes discover that their suspicions about the serial murders are correct. They uncover an elaborate CIA/Russian Mafia plot to smuggle chemical weapons into the U.S. in a most interesting and original manner. Complicating matters is the actual serial slayer, Christopher Maynard (Stephen Tobolowsky of "Momento"), who lives up to his weirdness. Frank Deverell (Bob Gunton of "The Shawshank Redemption") is Seagal's chief adversary who masterminds the chemical weapons smuggling operation. As a CIA honcho, Mr. Smith (Brian Cox of "The Long Kiss Goodnight") brings urbanity and a touch of Dixie to his duplicitous dastard. Cox makes such a impassive but slimy villain that he deserves the abuse that Seagal delivers with glee. The real fun in any Seagal epic is the incredible way that he crushes his adversaries without suffering any payback. Nothing in "The Glimmer Man" matches the far-fetched scene where he escapes the hoodlums right after he emerged from a coma and pushes his own gurney out of the hospital. Another change here is the joke-swapping rapport between Seabal and the impeccably tailored Wayans. Seagal characters aren't known for either their levity or their pranks. They are typically a humorless, moribund breed of hero. Keenen Ivory Wayans' presence helps to lighten things up in this bizarre thriller. He gets shot at, his apartment blown up, and he falls out of a high-rise motel window. Wayans looks and dresses ultra-cool but he gets no more respects and twice the number of bruises than Seagal. Underlying the complicated plot is the budding relationship between Cole and Campbell as they pursue their investigation in its bl00dsplattered, pyrotechnical explosive finale. The humor and antics that develop between these two make "The Glimmer Man" more interesting than the usual Seagal opus. "The Glimmer Man" is a vast improvement over "On Deadly Ground" and "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory," but it is just another potboiler, albeit a polished one. The powdered deer penis scene is hilarious.

    I was told that this film was an action comedy, the blurb on the back specifically made reference to 'punches mixed with punchlines' and the Pulitzer Prize winning 'the wit hits the fan'. What I actually got was a very large, rusted nail heavily thumped into Seagal's credibility. This coming from the guy who'd watch Under Siege 2 several days earlier. The Glimmer Man is ACTUALLY an action-thriller film about two cops trying to find a serial killer called the Family Man because he kills and crucifies whole families, what a hoot! Add in a dash of political intrigued, Vietnam veterans and conspiracy and you have a flop. The problem with this film is that the gunfights are handled relatively well but the fist fights (Seagal's selling point) is so rapidly edited that you only ever see about two kick strung together before the footage cuts elsewhere. Watching classics martial arts films (I'm thinking Bruce Lee/Donnie Yen films here) is that the editing and filming actually shows off the skills of the fighters on display. That is not present in the Glimmer Man, So what you eventually have with this action comedy is a film that has very little comedy and the action is badly done. Not all is bad however, the plot is actually fairly reasonable and there are plenty of twists and turns that somehow command your attention and there is quite a lot of potential there but you somehow end up with a hugely forgettable film.

    Film Synopsis: Los Angeles is rocked by a serial killer known as the "Family Man", slaughtering entire families & placing their bodies in crucifixion poses. Jim Campbell, the investigating detective on the case, is paired with Jack Cole, a mysterious detective who wears Tibetan prayer beads, has formidable martial arts skills & acts a bit weird. When the Family Man's latest victim turns out to be Cole's ex-wife, Campbell faces the possibility that Cole might be the killer. The Review: When David Fincher's dark masterpiece SE7EN came out in the mid-1990s, it spawned a number of films featuring fiendishly clever serial killers trying to highlight the flaws of society by killing people. The Glimmer Man owes a fair amount to Se7en with its killer trying to save people by turning them into martyrs. At least for the first hour, anyway. What we have here is a film that is actually a routine action film disguised as a buddy cop flick disguised as a serial killer film. This dishonesty is really quite insulting to the intelligence of the viewers & fans of Fincher's film. The Glimmer Man uses the serial killer angle of the plot to mask a standard CIA conspiracy plot with an arms dealer sending his top assassin to terminate some witnesses to his latest arms deal, covering his tracks by disguising the executions as the work of the serial killer. The other main problem with The Glimmer Man is the fact that it is a Steven Seagal film. Steven Seagal is a martial artist who came to fame in the late 80s actioner ABOVE THE LAW, starring in films such as HARD TO KILL, MARKED FOR DEATH, OUT FOR JUSTICE & his all-time best work, UNDER SIEGE. Seagal's films are almost always extremely violent action films with really sadistic aikido moves courtesy of Seagal. Here he engages in some of his famed aikido skills, catapulting CIA goons through walls in a restaurant; as well as displaying a good dose of sadism  he takes on Russian gangsters with a knife disguised as a credit card; interrogates his old boss by shooting him in his hands & feet; & propels the arms dealer's son through a window. The Glimmer Man tries to balance the sadism with some humour, most notably in the partnership between Seagal & Keenen Ivory Wayans. But this fails mainly due to the fact that they obviously can't stand each other  Wayans' idea of comedy is to make unwholesome remarks about people behind their backs & inserting a running joke about him quaffing some powdered deer genitals, which is quite painful to watch. Seagal fares better in the comedy stakes, delivering some amusing one-liners. As far as acting goes, the cast are mostly competent. Besides Wayans, the only other actor to stumble is Brian Cox, who goes through the film with a campy performance that doesn't suit him.

    Not really a very insightful movie that one can study for hours and think about a lot. Rather this is more of a typical Hollywood action movie. Cops are partnered in regards to opposing personalities (which I love because when done properly, especially in this movie, it creates a really relaxed atmosphere), cars blow up at the sightest touch, and the hero runs around killing heaps of people and blowing up heaps of buildings and the captain at the end says, "Cole, I owe you an apology." Cole (Steven Segal) is playing his usual ex-special forces come cop or something role. Almost the same role that he played in Under Siege and On Deadly Ground (and no doubt numerous other movies before and after). As is typical, Steven Segal will encounter a horde of bad guys and he will typically beat them all up single handedly, and then walk out of the room dusting himself off. The plot is interesting though. Segal is a cop that hunts down serial killers, but has a rather sordid past: not only is it somewhat unknown, his recent past in regards to tracking down serial killers is tainted for he shot one when on a roof of a building in New York and there were no witnesses. Now he is in Los Angeles and a serial killer is attacking again, but this time there some one is going around killing people and using the serial killer to cover his tracks. As one delves in deeper, one uncovers a plot involving the Russian mafia. Once again, as it typical of a Steven Segal movie, there is lots of action and lots of martial arts. That alone would have been quite boring; one sees cars and petrol tankers blowing up every time one turns on the television. What made this movie cool was the backchat between the partners.

    "The Glimmer Man," directed in 1996 by John Gray, is yet another typical Steven Seagal martial arts-action/crime-thriller, but it is undoubtedly one of his better movies from his heyday. "Under Siege" was not perfect by any means upon its blockbuster release in 1992, but it is unquestionably Seagal's best movie to date (which unfortunately doesn't say much about his wildly hit-and-miss career as a whole). By '96, when "The Glimmer Man" was released, Seagal had become something of a walking parody of himself and a rather formulaic action star; the stoic Aikido martial arts master with a shady government-agent background was quickly wearing itself out. A worthy addition to the formula in "The Glimmer Man" had Seagal sharing screen-time with another star performer, comedian Keenen Ivory Wayans. In "The Glimmer Man," Seagal is Jack Cole, a former black ops mercenary who received his nickname because in the darkest jungles of Vietnam during the war, all you saw was a "glimmer of a man" (or so we're told), and then you'd be dead. Cole has since become a homicide detective with strong spiritual leanings (he wears Buddhist prayer beads throughout the film and is quite keen on Eastern religion and philosophy), first in New York and now in Los Angeles, where he's first partnered up with Det. Jim Campbell (Wayans). From the beginning, this movie takes a few pages from the "Se7en" (1995) play-book with trippy editing/cinematography and a serial killer called "The Family Man" (so-called because he murders entire households) with religious motivations behind his serial killings; "Se7en" was still quite popular around this time, hence the reference. Their investigation leads to a confrontation with shady businessman Frank Deverell (Bob Gunton), and a plot involving both The Family Man and murderous Russian mobsters. Another wrinkle comes from the fact that Cole's ex-wife is one of the most recent victims of The Family Man, and he is now a suspect. The reason I feel that "The Glimmer Man" is one of Seagal's better vehicles is because 1) there's a believable dynamic between himself and Keenen Ivory Wayans, which makes the movie feel a bit different from his usual stuff because of the added bits of humorous dialogue, and 2) it has some of his best fight/action sequences, despite the fact that it is one of his lesser-regarded films overall. The fights here are quite brutal (Wayans's Campbell character even gets a few punches in, too, including a battle with an intruder in his apartment) and Seagal finally has an opponent in the end who can actually match him in hand-to-hand combat scenes. "The Glimmer Man" is a Steven Seagal movie post-"Under Siege" that is worthy of a "glimmer" of honorable mention amongst his catalog of films. 7/10

    A curious Seagal/Keenan Ivory Wayans team-up we have here. I'm not sure these two even have chemistry but they are such an odd couple that somehow I couldn't help but be entertained. Wayans does his usual smart-alec schtick while Seagal is some ex-CIA mystery man who walks around in some sort of nehru outfit with beads around his neck. He proceeds to tell some gangsters that fighting is against his religion. After which he then proceeds to kick their asses to a bloody pulp and even uses a credit card to slice a dude's throat. Haha! Yep, that sounds like our Zen-Buddhist Mr. Non-Violence himself. Seagal is clearly putting on some weight here. But at least his movies are still hitting theaters at this point. Though it's clear that 1996 was the beginning of Seagal's decline. UNDER SIEGE 2 in 1995 was his last great film. Heck, that was his best film. But starting with 1996 his films began to flounder. Heck, that same year he basically had a cameo in Stuart Baird's exceptional EXECUTIVE DECISION - where he got sucked out into thin air during a botched plane-to-plane transfer. Kurt Russell ended up saving the day in that one. Anyway it wasn't long before Seagal began to team up with washed-up rappers/wanna-be actors in his films. Then he just went straight do DVD. I guess teaming up with dudes like DMX and Ja Rule is not a good career move. But here in this film this odd combo of Seagal and Wayans somehow works. The story is pretty crap. Heck, it's very crap. Something about some Russian mob tied to some rich businessman and the C.I.A. and then some stupid subplot about some religious fanatic killing families. So yes, very crap story. But Seagal and Wayans entertained me. And the way Seagal folds his hands across his chest (like some Dalai Lama) only to then beat a bunch of dudes into a bloody pulp is just a joy to witness. Haha! And the way he beats up these guys is pure comedy! He just tosses them around into walls, sharp objects, windows, etc. without even breaking a sweat. I guess by 1996 Seagal didn't need to use actual aikido skills. He was just in this zen-like state where he could just push a dude and that was enough to maim him. And if that wasn't enough then he would just smack him across the face a few times and that would most certainly kill the sucker. Hilarious!!

    Jack Cole is a soft spoken, mystical, new age New York cop with a checkered past. He is transferred to Los Angeles to help Los Angeles cop Jim Campbell solve a series of brutal murders in which the victims are crucified. The murders that have happened since Jack arrived in Los Angeles just don't sit right with him. When the killer, known as the "Family Man", kills Ellen DunLeavy, who happens to be Jack's ex wife and the mother of his two kids, and Ellen's husband Andrew DunLeavy, it becomes personal - especially when Jack's prints are found on Ellen's body. Jack meets with his military mentor Smith, not knowing that Smith is in cahoots with local crime boss Frank Deverell..... This is probably the last prolific film Seagal released in the nineties, and it's a wonderful oddity of a movie. Mixing Se7en, with Lethal weapon is a strange combo, but the film makers and the two leads make this work very well, with the mixture of action and darkness just about balanced. Seagal and Wayans seem awkward as partners at first, but the humour is surprisingly intimate between the two, which makes them more believable as eventual friends. The story is exactly what you'd expect from a Seagal film, playing somebody with a shady past and a silly nickname (Seagal is the titular character), but it doesn't really need any attention, so it's best just to concentrate on the action scenes, which are very well choreographed, and very violent. he film has a very Gothic feel to it, which might deter other action fans, as it doesn't feel like a typical Seagal movie. With good support from Gunton and Cox (who was in every film in 1996) the Glimmer Man is a refreshing action movie, which deserved to do a little better at the box office.

    Aw,Steve,I love you,man.Ever since I saw "Under Siege"I have recommended your work to friends(some of whom,oddly,no longer call)and await each new addition to the canon with breathless eagerness. With "The Glimmer Man"You have truly blossomed out as a multi - lingual polymath. And you can kick arse and take names.That fight in the restaurant was quite exquisitely choreographed and brilliantly funny. No longer are you satisfied with being the new Buster Keaton(see my review of "Under Siege"),my guess is Woody Allen had better be looking over his shoulder real soon. You don't need a plot,just point the camera and give both your facial expressions,man.And kick arse and take names,obviously. My friend went to your Country and Western show in Worthing and said you were great.Unfortunately I couldn't make it 'cos I'm still considered a danger to the public. Bummer,man.

Mystery cloaks Cole so thoroughly that Campbell (Wayans) cannot decide whether to trust him or arrest him. Gradually, our detective heroes discover that their suspicions about the serial murders are correct. They uncover an elaborate CIA/Russian Mafia plot to smuggle chemical weapons into the U.S. in a most interesting and original manner. Complicating matters is the actual serial slayer, Christopher Maynard (Stephen Tobolowsky of "Momento"), who lives up to his weirdness. Frank Deverell (Bob Gunton of "The Shawshank Redemption") is Seagal's chief adversary who masterminds the chemical weapons smuggling operation. As a CIA honcho, Mr. Smith (Brian Cox of "The Long Kiss Goodnight") brings urbanity and a touch of Dixie to his duplicitous dastard. Cox makes such a impassive but slimy villain that he deserves the abuse that Seagal delivers with glee. The real fun in any Seagal epic is the incredible way that he crushes his adversaries without suffering any payback. Nothing in "The Glimmer Man" matches the far-fetched scene where he escapes the hoodlums right after he emerged from a coma and pushes his own gurney out of the hospital. Another change here is the joke-swapping rapport between Seabal and the impeccably tailored Wayans. Seagal characters aren't known for either their levity or their pranks. They are typically a humorless, moribund breed of hero. Keenen Ivory Wayans' presence helps to lighten things up in this bizarre thriller. He gets shot at, his apartment blown up, and he falls out of a high-rise motel window. Wayans looks and dresses ultra-cool but he gets no more respects and twice the number of bruises than Seagal. Underlying the complicated plot is the budding relationship between Cole and Campbell as they pursue their investigation in its bl00dsplattered, pyrotechnical explosive finale. The humor and antics that develop between these two make "The Glimmer Man" more interesting than the usual Seagal opus. "The Glimmer Man" is a vast improvement over "On Deadly Ground" and "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory," but it is just another potboiler, albeit a polished one. The powdered deer penis scene is hilarious.

    I was told that this film was an action comedy, the blurb on the back specifically made reference to 'punches mixed with punchlines' and the Pulitzer Prize winning 'the wit hits the fan'. What I actually got was a very large, rusted nail heavily thumped into Seagal's credibility. This coming from the guy who'd watch Under Siege 2 several days earlier. The Glimmer Man is ACTUALLY an action-thriller film about two cops trying to find a serial killer called the Family Man because he kills and crucifies whole families, what a hoot! Add in a dash of political intrigued, Vietnam veterans and conspiracy and you have a flop. The problem with this film is that the gunfights are handled relatively well but the fist fights (Seagal's selling point) is so rapidly edited that you only ever see about two kick strung together before the footage cuts elsewhere. Watching classics martial arts films (I'm thinking Bruce Lee/Donnie Yen films here) is that the editing and filming actually shows off the skills of the fighters on display. That is not present in the Glimmer Man, So what you eventually have with this action comedy is a film that has very little comedy and the action is badly done. Not all is bad however, the plot is actually fairly reasonable and there are plenty of twists and turns that somehow command your attention and there is quite a lot of potential there but you somehow end up with a hugely forgettable film.

    Film Synopsis: Los Angeles is rocked by a serial killer known as the "Family Man", slaughtering entire families & placing their bodies in crucifixion poses. Jim Campbell, the investigating detective on the case, is paired with Jack Cole, a mysterious detective who wears Tibetan prayer beads, has formidable martial arts skills & acts a bit weird. When the Family Man's latest victim turns out to be Cole's ex-wife, Campbell faces the possibility that Cole might be the killer. The Review: When David Fincher's dark masterpiece SE7EN came out in the mid-1990s, it spawned a number of films featuring fiendishly clever serial killers trying to highlight the flaws of society by killing people. The Glimmer Man owes a fair amount to Se7en with its killer trying to save people by turning them into martyrs. At least for the first hour, anyway. What we have here is a film that is actually a routine action film disguised as a buddy cop flick disguised as a serial killer film. This dishonesty is really quite insulting to the intelligence of the viewers & fans of Fincher's film. The Glimmer Man uses the serial killer angle of the plot to mask a standard CIA conspiracy plot with an arms dealer sending his top assassin to terminate some witnesses to his latest arms deal, covering his tracks by disguising the executions as the work of the serial killer. The other main problem with The Glimmer Man is the fact that it is a Steven Seagal film. Steven Seagal is a martial artist who came to fame in the late 80s actioner ABOVE THE LAW, starring in films such as HARD TO KILL, MARKED FOR DEATH, OUT FOR JUSTICE & his all-time best work, UNDER SIEGE. Seagal's films are almost always extremely violent action films with really sadistic aikido moves courtesy of Seagal. Here he engages in some of his famed aikido skills, catapulting CIA goons through walls in a restaurant; as well as displaying a good dose of sadism  he takes on Russian gangsters with a knife disguised as a credit card; interrogates his old boss by shooting him in his hands & feet; & propels the arms dealer's son through a window. The Glimmer Man tries to balance the sadism with some humour, most notably in the partnership between Seagal & Keenen Ivory Wayans. But this fails mainly due to the fact that they obviously can't stand each other  Wayans' idea of comedy is to make unwholesome remarks about people behind their backs & inserting a running joke about him quaffing some powdered deer genitals, which is quite painful to watch. Seagal fares better in the comedy stakes, delivering some amusing one-liners. As far as acting goes, the cast are mostly competent. Besides Wayans, the only other actor to stumble is Brian Cox, who goes through the film with a campy performance that doesn't suit him.

    Not really a very insightful movie that one can study for hours and think about a lot. Rather this is more of a typical Hollywood action movie. Cops are partnered in regards to opposing personalities (which I love because when done properly, especially in this movie, it creates a really relaxed atmosphere), cars blow up at the sightest touch, and the hero runs around killing heaps of people and blowing up heaps of buildings and the captain at the end says, "Cole, I owe you an apology." Cole (Steven Segal) is playing his usual ex-special forces come cop or something role. Almost the same role that he played in Under Siege and On Deadly Ground (and no doubt numerous other movies before and after). As is typical, Steven Segal will encounter a horde of bad guys and he will typically beat them all up single handedly, and then walk out of the room dusting himself off. The plot is interesting though. Segal is a cop that hunts down serial killers, but has a rather sordid past: not only is it somewhat unknown, his recent past in regards to tracking down serial killers is tainted for he shot one when on a roof of a building in New York and there were no witnesses. Now he is in Los Angeles and a serial killer is attacking again, but this time there some one is going around killing people and using the serial killer to cover his tracks. As one delves in deeper, one uncovers a plot involving the Russian mafia. Once again, as it typical of a Steven Segal movie, there is lots of action and lots of martial arts. That alone would have been quite boring; one sees cars and petrol tankers blowing up every time one turns on the television. What made this movie cool was the backchat between the partners.

    "The Glimmer Man," directed in 1996 by John Gray, is yet another typical Steven Seagal martial arts-action/crime-thriller, but it is undoubtedly one of his better movies from his heyday. "Under Siege" was not perfect by any means upon its blockbuster release in 1992, but it is unquestionably Seagal's best movie to date (which unfortunately doesn't say much about his wildly hit-and-miss career as a whole). By '96, when "The Glimmer Man" was released, Seagal had become something of a walking parody of himself and a rather formulaic action star; the stoic Aikido martial arts master with a shady government-agent background was quickly wearing itself out. A worthy addition to the formula in "The Glimmer Man" had Seagal sharing screen-time with another star performer, comedian Keenen Ivory Wayans. In "The Glimmer Man," Seagal is Jack Cole, a former black ops mercenary who received his nickname because in the darkest jungles of Vietnam during the war, all you saw was a "glimmer of a man" (or so we're told), and then you'd be dead. Cole has since become a homicide detective with strong spiritual leanings (he wears Buddhist prayer beads throughout the film and is quite keen on Eastern religion and philosophy), first in New York and now in Los Angeles, where he's first partnered up with Det. Jim Campbell (Wayans). From the beginning, this movie takes a few pages from the "Se7en" (1995) play-book with trippy editing/cinematography and a serial killer called "The Family Man" (so-called because he murders entire households) with religious motivations behind his serial killings; "Se7en" was still quite popular around this time, hence the reference. Their investigation leads to a confrontation with shady businessman Frank Deverell (Bob Gunton), and a plot involving both The Family Man and murderous Russian mobsters. Another wrinkle comes from the fact that Cole's ex-wife is one of the most recent victims of The Family Man, and he is now a suspect. The reason I feel that "The Glimmer Man" is one of Seagal's better vehicles is because 1) there's a believable dynamic between himself and Keenen Ivory Wayans, which makes the movie feel a bit different from his usual stuff because of the added bits of humorous dialogue, and 2) it has some of his best fight/action sequences, despite the fact that it is one of his lesser-regarded films overall. The fights here are quite brutal (Wayans's Campbell character even gets a few punches in, too, including a battle with an intruder in his apartment) and Seagal finally has an opponent in the end who can actually match him in hand-to-hand combat scenes. "The Glimmer Man" is a Steven Seagal movie post-"Under Siege" that is worthy of a "glimmer" of honorable mention amongst his catalog of films. 7/10

    A curious Seagal/Keenan Ivory Wayans team-up we have here. I'm not sure these two even have chemistry but they are such an odd couple that somehow I couldn't help but be entertained. Wayans does his usual smart-alec schtick while Seagal is some ex-CIA mystery man who walks around in some sort of nehru outfit with beads around his neck. He proceeds to tell some gangsters that fighting is against his religion. After which he then proceeds to kick their asses to a bloody pulp and even uses a credit card to slice a dude's throat. Haha! Yep, that sounds like our Zen-Buddhist Mr. Non-Violence himself. Seagal is clearly putting on some weight here. But at least his movies are still hitting theaters at this point. Though it's clear that 1996 was the beginning of Seagal's decline. UNDER SIEGE 2 in 1995 was his last great film. Heck, that was his best film. But starting with 1996 his films began to flounder. Heck, that same year he basically had a cameo in Stuart Baird's exceptional EXECUTIVE DECISION - where he got sucked out into thin air during a botched plane-to-plane transfer. Kurt Russell ended up saving the day in that one. Anyway it wasn't long before Seagal began to team up with washed-up rappers/wanna-be actors in his films. Then he just went straight do DVD. I guess teaming up with dudes like DMX and Ja Rule is not a good career move. But here in this film this odd combo of Seagal and Wayans somehow works. The story is pretty crap. Heck, it's very crap. Something about some Russian mob tied to some rich businessman and the C.I.A. and then some stupid subplot about some religious fanatic killing families. So yes, very crap story. But Seagal and Wayans entertained me. And the way Seagal folds his hands across his chest (like some Dalai Lama) only to then beat a bunch of dudes into a bloody pulp is just a joy to witness. Haha! And the way he beats up these guys is pure comedy! He just tosses them around into walls, sharp objects, windows, etc. without even breaking a sweat. I guess by 1996 Seagal didn't need to use actual aikido skills. He was just in this zen-like state where he could just push a dude and that was enough to maim him. And if that wasn't enough then he would just smack him across the face a few times and that would most certainly kill the sucker. Hilarious!!

    Jack Cole is a soft spoken, mystical, new age New York cop with a checkered past. He is transferred to Los Angeles to help Los Angeles cop Jim Campbell solve a series of brutal murders in which the victims are crucified. The murders that have happened since Jack arrived in Los Angeles just don't sit right with him. When the killer, known as the "Family Man", kills Ellen DunLeavy, who happens to be Jack's ex wife and the mother of his two kids, and Ellen's husband Andrew DunLeavy, it becomes personal - especially when Jack's prints are found on Ellen's body. Jack meets with his military mentor Smith, not knowing that Smith is in cahoots with local crime boss Frank Deverell..... This is probably the last prolific film Seagal released in the nineties, and it's a wonderful oddity of a movie. Mixing Se7en, with Lethal weapon is a strange combo, but the film makers and the two leads make this work very well, with the mixture of action and darkness just about balanced. Seagal and Wayans seem awkward as partners at first, but the humour is surprisingly intimate between the two, which makes them more believable as eventual friends. The story is exactly what you'd expect from a Seagal film, playing somebody with a shady past and a silly nickname (Seagal is the titular character), but it doesn't really need any attention, so it's best just to concentrate on the action scenes, which are very well choreographed, and very violent. he film has a very Gothic feel to it, which might deter other action fans, as it doesn't feel like a typical Seagal movie. With good support from Gunton and Cox (who was in every film in 1996) the Glimmer Man is a refreshing action movie, which deserved to do a little better at the box office.

    Aw,Steve,I love you,man.Ever since I saw "Under Siege"I have recommended your work to friends(some of whom,oddly,no longer call)and await each new addition to the canon with breathless eagerness. With "The Glimmer Man"You have truly blossomed out as a multi - lingual polymath. And you can kick arse and take names.That fight in the restaurant was quite exquisitely choreographed and brilliantly funny. No longer are you satisfied with being the new Buster Keaton(see my review of "Under Siege"),my guess is Woody Allen had better be looking over his shoulder real soon. You don't need a plot,just point the camera and give both your facial expressions,man.And kick arse and take names,obviously. My friend went to your Country and Western show in Worthing and said you were great.Unfortunately I couldn't make it 'cos I'm still considered a danger to the public. Bummer,man.

    The only reason this movie was made is probably to satisfy Seagal's huge ego . THE WHOLE MOVIE is basically a non stop marathon about how Seagal's character is awesome , tough , smart , handsome and bla bla bla bla . Someone here needs a therapy  Anyway , that's the biggest problem of the movie . I quickly became annoyed with all this Seagal worship that doesn't end until the ending credits appear. Even sticking to well liked by audiences formula of buddy cop movie isn't able to save the movie . Maybe because Wayans isn't one bit funny. "The Glimmer man" tries to have a dark atmosphere like "Se7en" , but fails . Not to mention that the whole movie feels low budget made for  TV movie . In the end the movie makers tried desperately to impress the audience at least with violence , yet it comes out like a cheap shock. Story ? What story ? Action ? Typical unimpressive Seagal style. Avoid it . I give it 1/10.

    A practicing-Buddhist detective (Steven Seagal) joins forces with a wise-cracking, LA cop (Damon Wayans) on the cases of a serial killer called The Family Man who intrudes on the homes of families, shooting them in the foreheads point blank (the gun, equipped with silencer), then displaying them in the ritualistic form of the Crucifix, spiked to their bedroom walls. Soon, however, Seagal realizes that certain murders might be imitations, meant to resemble those of The Family Man, in actuality tied to chemical weapons smuggled and meant for sale to terrorists. Wayans loses his home, and suffers great harm to his person, thanks to his association with Seagal. I did think I would like this a little more than I did. Sure, Seagal has the requisite fight scene where he hurls men through tables, across the bar, through windows, and crashing into displays and walls, with broken bottles and faces as a result. There's a treasure of villainy, including Brian Cox as a CIA government man from Seagal's past, Bob Gunton (Shawshank Redemption) as the one responsible for negotiating the weapons trade with the Russian mob, Stephen Tobolowsky as The Family Man (who Seagal must kill in a Catholic Church much to his dismay after repeated warnings), and John M Jackson as Gunton's enforcer soon turning on his boss. Jackson is the unfortunate final bad guy and the eventual recipient of a major ass-whooping. I honestly think the feeling of familiarity with the plot and action scenes (the serial killing subplot shows us some grisly crime scenes but the approach to solving them is uninspired; this is more about the--yawn-- weapons smuggling uncovering than removing a serial killer from the streets) hurts The Glimmer Man. Yes, faces are beaten to a bloody and battered pulp, and Seagal's hands still move at warp speed when he destroys his foes, but I found myself just wanting more this time around. Wayans tries to use his sense of humor to save the day, and Seagal looks as relaxed and comfortable as I have ever seen him; but, the film simply lacks grit and intensity (there's also that energy missing) needed considering what the heroes are up against. This is a good example of the beginnings in Seagal's action hero decline. This was also a glaring example of Seagal's continuing chunky physique; I'm not one to harp on this as some do, but his limited movement does deter from the authenticity of his fight scenes...that said, at least he can absorb extra punishment and move more than one man around without it seeming less realistic.

    The latest Steven Seagal crime movie "The Glimmer Man" takes its title from the hero's dexterity and cunning at eliminating his foes before they can retaliate. Devoted fans of the real-life Aikido master will cheer their pony-tail hero as he demolishes his usual quota of thuggish villains who richly deserve every slap, smack, punch, and crackle they receive from Seagal as a way of atonement. What might upset them are the many variations that embellish this saga. No, "The Glimmer Man" isn't a message-laden, ecological nightmare that Seagal's earlier epic "On Deadly Ground" was. This Seagal vehicle grafts a creepy, whodunit, serial killer plot reminiscent of the 1995 Brad Pitt chiller "Se7en" onto a standard-issue police procedural. This time out we're allowed to laugh a little at the antics of Seagal and his newest sidekick, LAPD Detective Jim Campbell (Keenen Ivory Wayans of "A Lone Down Dirty Shame"), who gets to be the butt of our protagonist's pranks. The script allows Wayans to behave in a fashion that would appear inappropriate for the screen persona of Seagal's indestructible character. For instance, we get to see Wayans cry like a baby as he watches "Casablanca" in a downtown movie palace. Seagal's recent pictures have been overshadowed by his 1992 box office smash "Under Siege." "The Glimmer Man" represents an appeal to a more broadly defined audience, but nevertheless, it is more a watchable than most of his far-fetched fare. Steven Seagal's "Glimmer Man" character Jack Cole replicates the cop that he played in his cinematic debut "Hard to Kill" 9(1988) who had a hazy background as a CIA agent. Here, Seagal plays an ex-CIA assassin who plied his trade during the Vietnam War. As usual, Cole suffered from the lone wolf, "Dirty Harry," syndrome. Mystery cloaks Cole so thoroughly that Campbell (Wayans) cannot decide whether to trust him or arrest him. Gradually, our detective heroes discover that their suspicions about the serial murders are correct. They uncover an elaborate CIA/Russian Mafia plot to smuggle chemical weapons into the U.S. in a most interesting and original manner. Complicating matters is the actual serial slayer, Christopher Maynard (Stephen Tobolowsky of "Momento"), who lives up to his weirdness. Frank Deverell (Bob Gunton of "The Shawshank Redemption") is Seagal's chief adversary who masterminds the chemical weapons smuggling operation. As a CIA honcho, Mr. Smith (Brian Cox of "The Long Kiss Goodnight") brings urbanity and a touch of Dixie to his duplicitous dastard. Cox makes such a impassive but slimy villain that he deserves the abuse that Seagal delivers with glee. The real fun in any Seagal epic is the incredible way that he crushes his adversaries without suffering any payback. Nothing in "The Glimmer Man" matches the far-fetched scene where he escapes the hoodlums right after he emerged from a coma and pushes his own gurney out of the hospital. Another change here is the joke-swapping rapport between Seabal and the impeccably tailored Wayans. Seagal characters aren't known for either their levity or their pranks. They are typically a humorless, moribund breed of hero. Keenen Ivory Wayans' presence helps to lighten things up in this bizarre thriller. He gets shot at, his apartment blown up, and he falls out of a high-rise motel window. Wayans looks and dresses ultra-cool but he gets no more respects and twice the number of bruises than Seagal. Underlying the complicated plot is the budding relationship between Cole and Campbell as they pursue their investigation in its bl00dsplattered, pyrotechnical explosive finale. The humor and antics that develop between these two make "The Glimmer Man" more interesting than the usual Seagal opus. "The Glimmer Man" is a vast improvement over "On Deadly Ground" and "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory," but it is just another potboiler, albeit a polished one.

    "The Glimmer Man," directed in 1996 by John Gray, is yet another typical Steven Seagal martial arts-action/crime-thriller, but it is undoubtedly one of his better movies from his heyday. "Under Siege" was not perfect by any means upon its blockbuster release in 1992, but it is unquestionably Seagal's best movie to date (which unfortunately doesn't say much about his wildly hit-and-miss career as a whole). By '96, when "The Glimmer Man" was released, Seagal had become something of a walking parody of himself and a rather formulaic action star; the stoic Aikido martial arts master with a shady government-agent background was quickly wearing itself out. A worthy addition to the formula in "The Glimmer Man" had Seagal sharing screen-time with another star performer, comedian Keenen Ivory Wayans. In "The Glimmer Man," Seagal is Jack Cole, a former black ops mercenary who received his nickname because in the darkest jungles of Vietnam during the war, all you saw was a "glimmer of a man" (or so we're told), and then you'd be dead. Cole has since become a homicide detective with strong spiritual leanings (he wears Buddhist prayer beads throughout the film and is quite keen on Eastern religion and philosophy), first in New York and now in Los Angeles, where he's first partnered up with Det. Jim Campbell (Wayans). From the beginning, this movie takes a few pages from the "Se7en" (1995) play-book with trippy editing/cinematography and a serial killer called "The Family Man" (so-called because he murders entire households) with religious motivations behind his serial killings; "Se7en" was still quite popular around this time, hence the reference. Their investigation leads to a confrontation with shady businessman Frank Deverell (Bob Gunton), and a plot involving both The Family Man and murderous Russian mobsters. Another wrinkle comes from the fact that Cole's ex-wife is one of the most recent victims of The Family Man, and he is now a suspect. The reason I feel that "The Glimmer Man" is one of Seagal's better vehicles is because 1) there's a believable dynamic between himself and Keenen Ivory Wayans, which makes the movie feel a bit different from his usual stuff because of the added bits of humorous dialogue, and 2) it has some of his best fight/action sequences, despite the fact that it is one of his lesser-regarded films overall. The fights here are quite brutal (Wayans's Campbell character even gets a few punches in, too, including a battle with an intruder in his apartment) and Seagal finally has an opponent in the end who can actually match him in hand-to-hand combat scenes. "The Glimmer Man" is a Steven Seagal movie post-"Under Siege" that is worthy of a "glimmer" of honorable mention amongst his catalog of films. 7/10

    A curious Seagal/Keenan Ivory Wayans team-up we have here. I'm not sure these two even have chemistry but they are such an odd couple that somehow I couldn't help but be entertained. Wayans does his usual smart-alec schtick while Seagal is some ex-CIA mystery man who walks around in some sort of nehru outfit with beads around his neck. He proceeds to tell some gangsters that fighting is against his religion. After which he then proceeds to kick their asses to a bloody pulp and even uses a credit card to slice a dude's throat. Haha! Yep, that sounds like our Zen-Buddhist Mr. Non-Violence himself. Seagal is clearly putting on some weight here. But at least his movies are still hitting theaters at this point. Though it's clear that 1996 was the beginning of Seagal's decline. UNDER SIEGE 2 in 1995 was his last great film. Heck, that was his best film. But starting with 1996 his films began to flounder. Heck, that same year he basically had a cameo in Stuart Baird's exceptional EXECUTIVE DECISION - where he got sucked out into thin air during a botched plane-to-plane transfer. Kurt Russell ended up saving the day in that one. Anyway it wasn't long before Seagal began to team up with washed-up rappers/wanna-be actors in his films. Then he just went straight do DVD. I guess teaming up with dudes like DMX and Ja Rule is not a good career move. But here in this film this odd combo of Seagal and Wayans somehow works. The story is pretty crap. Heck, it's very crap. Something about some Russian mob tied to some rich businessman and the C.I.A. and then some stupid subplot about some religious fanatic killing families. So yes, very crap story. But Seagal and Wayans entertained me. And the way Seagal folds his hands across his chest (like some Dalai Lama) only to then beat a bunch of dudes into a bloody pulp is just a joy to witness. Haha! And the way he beats up these guys is pure comedy! He just tosses them around into walls, sharp objects, windows, etc. without even breaking a sweat. I guess by 1996 Seagal didn't need to use actual aikido skills. He was just in this zen-like state where he could just push a dude and that was enough to maim him. And if that wasn't enough then he would just smack him across the face a few times and that would most certainly kill the sucker. Hilarious!!

    Jack Cole is a soft spoken, mystical, new age New York cop with a checkered past. He is transferred to Los Angeles to help Los Angeles cop Jim Campbell solve a series of brutal murders in which the victims are crucified. The murders that have happened since Jack arrived in Los Angeles just don't sit right with him. When the killer, known as the "Family Man", kills Ellen DunLeavy, who happens to be Jack's ex wife and the mother of his two kids, and Ellen's husband Andrew DunLeavy, it becomes personal - especially when Jack's prints are found on Ellen's body. Jack meets with his military mentor Smith, not knowing that Smith is in cahoots with local crime boss Frank Deverell..... This is probably the last prolific film Seagal released in the nineties, and it's a wonderful oddity of a movie. Mixing Se7en, with Lethal weapon is a strange combo, but the film makers and the two leads make this work very well, with the mixture of action and darkness just about balanced. Seagal and Wayans seem awkward as partners at first, but the humour is surprisingly intimate between the two, which makes them more believable as eventual friends. The story is exactly what you'd expect from a Seagal film, playing somebody with a shady past and a silly nickname (Seagal is the titular character), but it doesn't really need any attention, so it's best just to concentrate on the action scenes, which are very well choreographed, and very violent. he film has a very Gothic feel to it, which might deter other action fans, as it doesn't feel like a typical Seagal movie. With good support from Gunton and Cox (who was in every film in 1996) the Glimmer Man is a refreshing action movie, which deserved to do a little better at the box office.

    Aw,Steve,I love you,man.Ever since I saw "Under Siege"I have recommended your work to friends(some of whom,oddly,no longer call)and await each new addition to the canon with breathless eagerness. With "The Glimmer Man"You have truly blossomed out as a multi - lingual polymath. And you can kick arse and take names.That fight in the restaurant was quite exquisitely choreographed and brilliantly funny. No longer are you satisfied with being the new Buster Keaton(see my review of "Under Siege"),my guess is Woody Allen had better be looking over his shoulder real soon. You don't need a plot,just point the camera and give both your facial expressions,man.And kick arse and take names,obviously. My friend went to your Country and Western show in Worthing and said you were great.Unfortunately I couldn't make it 'cos I'm still considered a danger to the public. Bummer,man.

    The only reason this movie was made is probably to satisfy Seagal's huge ego . THE WHOLE MOVIE is basically a non stop marathon about how Seagal's character is awesome , tough , smart , handsome and bla bla bla bla . Someone here needs a therapy  Anyway , that's the biggest problem of the movie . I quickly became annoyed with all this Seagal worship that doesn't end until the ending credits appear. Even sticking to well liked by audiences formula of buddy cop movie isn't able to save the movie . Maybe because Wayans isn't one bit funny. "The Glimmer man" tries to have a dark atmosphere like "Se7en" , but fails . Not to mention that the whole movie feels low budget made for  TV movie . In the end the movie makers tried desperately to impress the audience at least with violence , yet it comes out like a cheap shock. Story ? What story ? Action ? Typical unimpressive Seagal style. Avoid it . I give it 1/10.

    A practicing-Buddhist detective (Steven Seagal) joins forces with a wise-cracking, LA cop (Damon Wayans) on the cases of a serial killer called The Family Man who intrudes on the homes of families, shooting them in the foreheads point blank (the gun, equipped with silencer), then displaying them in the ritualistic form of the Crucifix, spiked to their bedroom walls. Soon, however, Seagal realizes that certain murders might be imitations, meant to resemble those of The Family Man, in actuality tied to chemical weapons smuggled and meant for sale to terrorists. Wayans loses his home, and suffers great harm to his person, thanks to his association with Seagal. I did think I would like this a little more than I did. Sure, Seagal has the requisite fight scene where he hurls men through tables, across the bar, through windows, and crashing into displays and walls, with broken bottles and faces as a result. There's a treasure of villainy, including Brian Cox as a CIA government man from Seagal's past, Bob Gunton (Shawshank Redemption) as the one responsible for negotiating the weapons trade with the Russian mob, Stephen Tobolowsky as The Family Man (who Seagal must kill in a Catholic Church much to his dismay after repeated warnings), and John M Jackson as Gunton's enforcer soon turning on his boss. Jackson is the unfortunate final bad guy and the eventual recipient of a major ass-whooping. I honestly think the feeling of familiarity with the plot and action scenes (the serial killing subplot shows us some grisly crime scenes but the approach to solving them is uninspired; this is more about the--yawn-- weapons smuggling uncovering than removing a serial killer from the streets) hurts The Glimmer Man. Yes, faces are beaten to a bloody and battered pulp, and Seagal's hands still move at warp speed when he destroys his foes, but I found myself just wanting more this time around. Wayans tries to use his sense of humor to save the day, and Seagal looks as relaxed and comfortable as I have ever seen him; but, the film simply lacks grit and intensity (there's also that energy missing) needed considering what the heroes are up against. This is a good example of the beginnings in Seagal's action hero decline. This was also a glaring example of Seagal's continuing chunky physique; I'm not one to harp on this as some do, but his limited movement does deter from the authenticity of his fight scenes...that said, at least he can absorb extra punishment and move more than one man around without it seeming less realistic.

    The latest Steven Seagal crime movie "The Glimmer Man" takes its title from the hero's dexterity and cunning at eliminating his foes before they can retaliate. Devoted fans of the real-life Aikido master will cheer their pony-tail hero as he demolishes his usual quota of thuggish villains who richly deserve every slap, smack, punch, and crackle they receive from Seagal as a way of atonement. What might upset them are the many variations that embellish this saga. No, "The Glimmer Man" isn't a message-laden, ecological nightmare that Seagal's earlier epic "On Deadly Ground" was. This Seagal vehicle grafts a creepy, whodunit, serial killer plot reminiscent of the 1995 Brad Pitt chiller "Se7en" onto a standard-issue police procedural. This time out we're allowed to laugh a little at the antics of Seagal and his newest sidekick, LAPD Detective Jim Campbell (Keenen Ivory Wayans of "A Lone Down Dirty Shame"), who gets to be the butt of our protagonist's pranks. The script allows Wayans to behave in a fashion that would appear inappropriate for the screen persona of Seagal's indestructible character. For instance, we get to see Wayans cry like a baby as he watches "Casablanca" in a downtown movie palace. Seagal's recent pictures have been overshadowed by his 1992 box office smash "Under Siege." "The Glimmer Man" represents an appeal to a more broadly defined audience, but nevertheless, it is more a watchable than most of his far-fetched fare. Steven Seagal's "Glimmer Man" character Jack Cole replicates the cop that he played in his cinematic debut "Hard to Kill" 9(1988) who had a hazy background as a CIA agent. Here, Seagal plays an ex-CIA assassin who plied his trade during the Vietnam War. As usual, Cole suffered from the lone wolf, "Dirty Harry," syndrome. Mystery cloaks Cole so thoroughly that Campbell (Wayans) cannot decide whether to trust him or arrest him. Gradually, our detective heroes discover that their suspicions about the serial murders are correct. They uncover an elaborate CIA/Russian Mafia plot to smuggle chemical weapons into the U.S. in a most interesting and original manner. Complicating matters is the actual serial slayer, Christopher Maynard (Stephen Tobolowsky of "Momento"), who lives up to his weirdness. Frank Deverell (Bob Gunton of "The Shawshank Redemption") is Seagal's chief adversary who masterminds the chemical weapons smuggling operation. As a CIA honcho, Mr. Smith (Brian Cox of "The Long Kiss Goodnight") brings urbanity and a touch of Dixie to his duplicitous dastard. Cox makes such a impassive but slimy villain that he deserves the abuse that Seagal delivers with glee. The real fun in any Seagal epic is the incredible way that he crushes his adversaries without suffering any payback. Nothing in "The Glimmer Man" matches the far-fetched scene where he escapes the hoodlums right after he emerged from a coma and pushes his own gurney out of the hospital. Another change here is the joke-swapping rapport between Seabal and the impeccably tailored Wayans. Seagal characters aren't known for either their levity or their pranks. They are typically a humorless, moribund breed of hero. Keenen Ivory Wayans' presence helps to lighten things up in this bizarre thriller. He gets shot at, his apartment blown up, and he falls out of a high-rise motel window. Wayans looks and dresses ultra-cool but he gets no more respects and twice the number of bruises than Seagal. Underlying the complicated plot is the budding relationship between Cole and Campbell as they pursue their investigation in its bl00dsplattered, pyrotechnical explosive finale. The humor and antics that develop between these two make "The Glimmer Man" more interesting than the usual Seagal opus. "The Glimmer Man" is a vast improvement over "On Deadly Ground" and "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory," but it is just another potboiler, albeit a polished one. The powdered deer penis scene is hilarious.

    I was told that this film was an action comedy, the blurb on the back specifically made reference to 'punches mixed with punchlines' and the Pulitzer Prize winning 'the wit hits the fan'. What I actually got was a very large, rusted nail heavily thumped into Seagal's credibility. This coming from the guy who'd watch Under Siege 2 several days earlier. The Glimmer Man is ACTUALLY an action-thriller film about two cops trying to find a serial killer called the Family Man because he kills and crucifies whole families, what a hoot! Add in a dash of political intrigued, Vietnam veterans and conspiracy and you have a flop. The problem with this film is that the gunfights are handled relatively well but the fist fights (Seagal's selling point) is so rapidly edited that you only ever see about two kick strung together before the footage cuts elsewhere. Watching classics martial arts films (I'm thinking Bruce Lee/Donnie Yen films here) is that the editing and filming actually shows off the skills of the fighters on display. That is not present in the Glimmer Man, So what you eventually have with this action comedy is a film that has very little comedy and the action is badly done. Not all is bad however, the plot is actually fairly reasonable and there are plenty of twists and turns that somehow command your attention and there is quite a lot of potential there but you somehow end up with a hugely forgettable film.

    Film Synopsis: Los Angeles is rocked by a serial killer known as the "Family Man", slaughtering entire families & placing their bodies in crucifixion poses. Jim Campbell, the investigating detective on the case, is paired with Jack Cole, a mysterious detective who wears Tibetan prayer beads, has formidable martial arts skills & acts a bit weird. When the Family Man's latest victim turns out to be Cole's ex-wife, Campbell faces the possibility that Cole might be the killer. The Review: When David Fincher's dark masterpiece SE7EN came out in the mid-1990s, it spawned a number of films featuring fiendishly clever serial killers trying to highlight the flaws of society by killing people. The Glimmer Man owes a fair amount to Se7en with its killer trying to save people by turning them into martyrs. At least for the first hour, anyway. What we have here is a film that is actually a routine action film disguised as a buddy cop flick disguised as a serial killer film. This dishonesty is really quite insulting to the intelligence of the viewers & fans of Fincher's film. The Glimmer Man uses the serial killer angle of the plot to mask a standard CIA conspiracy plot with an arms dealer sending his top assassin to terminate some witnesses to his latest arms deal, covering his tracks by disguising the executions as the work of the serial killer. The other main problem with The Glimmer Man is the fact that it is a Steven Seagal film. Steven Seagal is a martial artist who came to fame in the late 80s actioner ABOVE THE LAW, starring in films such as HARD TO KILL, MARKED FOR DEATH, OUT FOR JUSTICE & his all-time best work, UNDER SIEGE. Seagal's films are almost always extremely violent action films with really sadistic aikido moves courtesy of Seagal. Here he engages in some of his famed aikido skills, catapulting CIA goons through walls in a restaurant; as well as displaying a good dose of sadism  he takes on Russian gangsters with a knife disguised as a credit card; interrogates his old boss by shooting him in his hands & feet; & propels the arms dealer's son through a window. The Glimmer Man tries to balance the sadism with some humour, most notably in the partnership between Seagal & Keenen Ivory Wayans. But this fails mainly due to the fact that they obviously can't stand each other  Wayans' idea of comedy is to make unwholesome remarks about people behind their backs & inserting a running joke about him quaffing some powdered deer genitals, which is quite painful to watch. Seagal fares better in the comedy stakes, delivering some amusing one-liners. As far as acting goes, the cast are mostly competent. Besides Wayans, the only other actor to stumble is Brian Cox, who goes through the film with a campy performance that doesn't suit him.

    Not really a very insightful movie that one can study for hours and think about a lot. Rather this is more of a typical Hollywood action movie. Cops are partnered in regards to opposing personalities (which I love because when done properly, especially in this movie, it creates a really relaxed atmosphere), cars blow up at the sightest touch, and the hero runs around killing heaps of people and blowing up heaps of buildings and the captain at the end says, "Cole, I owe you an apology." Cole (Steven Segal) is playing his usual ex-special forces come cop or something role. Almost the same role that he played in Under Siege and On Deadly Ground (and no doubt numerous other movies before and after). As is typical, Steven Segal will encounter a horde of bad guys and he will typically beat them all up single handedly, and then walk out of the room dusting himself off. The plot is interesting though. Segal is a cop that hunts down serial killers, but has a rather sordid past: not only is it somewhat unknown, his recent past in regards to tracking down serial killers is tainted for he shot one when on a roof of a building in New York and there were no witnesses. Now he is in Los Angeles and a serial killer is attacking again, but this time there some one is going around killing people and using the serial killer to cover his tracks. As one delves in deeper, one uncovers a plot involving the Russian mafia. Once again, as it typical of a Steven Segal movie, there is lots of action and lots of martial arts. That alone would have been quite boring; one sees cars and petrol tankers blowing up every time one turns on the television. What made this movie cool was the backchat between the partners.

    Aw,Steve,I love you,man.Ever since I saw "Under Siege"I have recommended your work to friends(some of whom,oddly,no longer call)and await each new addition to the canon with breathless eagerness. With "The Glimmer Man"You have truly blossomed out as a multi - lingual polymath. And you can kick arse and take names.That fight in the restaurant was quite exquisitely choreographed and brilliantly funny. No longer are you satisfied with being the new Buster Keaton(see my review of "Under Siege"),my guess is Woody Allen had better be looking over his shoulder real soon. You don't need a plot,just point the camera and give both your facial expressions,man.And kick arse and take names,obviously. My friend went to your Country and Western show in Worthing and said you were great.Unfortunately I couldn't make it 'cos I'm still considered a danger to the public. Bummer,man.

    The only reason this movie was made is probably to satisfy Seagal's huge ego . THE WHOLE MOVIE is basically a non stop marathon about how Seagal's character is awesome , tough , smart , handsome and bla bla bla bla . Someone here needs a therapy  Anyway , that's the biggest problem of the movie . I quickly became annoyed with all this Seagal worship that doesn't end until the ending credits appear. Even sticking to well liked by audiences formula of buddy cop movie isn't able to save the movie . Maybe because Wayans isn't one bit funny. "The Glimmer man" tries to have a dark atmosphere like "Se7en" , but fails . Not to mention that the whole movie feels low budget made for  TV movie . In the end the movie makers tried desperately to impress the audience at least with violence , yet it comes out like a cheap shock. Story ? What story ? Action ? Typical unimpressive Seagal style. Avoid it . I give it 1/10.

    A practicing-Buddhist detective (Steven Seagal) joins forces with a wise-cracking, LA cop (Damon Wayans) on the cases of a serial killer called The Family Man who intrudes on the homes of families, shooting them in the foreheads point blank (the gun, equipped with silencer), then displaying them in the ritualistic form of the Crucifix, spiked to their bedroom walls. Soon, however, Seagal realizes that certain murders might be imitations, meant to resemble those of The Family Man, in actuality tied to chemical weapons smuggled and meant for sale to terrorists. Wayans loses his home, and suffers great harm to his person, thanks to his association with Seagal. I did think I would like this a little more than I did. Sure, Seagal has the requisite fight scene where he hurls men through tables, across the bar, through windows, and crashing into displays and walls, with broken bottles and faces as a result. There's a treasure of villainy, including Brian Cox as a CIA government man from Seagal's past, Bob Gunton (Shawshank Redemption) as the one responsible for negotiating the weapons trade with the Russian mob, Stephen Tobolowsky as The Family Man (who Seagal must kill in a Catholic Church much to his dismay after repeated warnings), and John M Jackson as Gunton's enforcer soon turning on his boss. Jackson is the unfortunate final bad guy and the eventual recipient of a major ass-whooping. I honestly think the feeling of familiarity with the plot and action scenes (the serial killing subplot shows us some grisly crime scenes but the approach to solving them is uninspired; this is more about the--yawn-- weapons smuggling uncovering than removing a serial killer from the streets) hurts The Glimmer Man. Yes, faces are beaten to a bloody and battered pulp, and Seagal's hands still move at warp speed when he destroys his foes, but I found myself just wanting more this time around. Wayans tries to use his sense of humor to save the day, and Seagal looks as relaxed and comfortable as I have ever seen him; but, the film simply lacks grit and intensity (there's also that energy missing) needed considering what the heroes are up against. This is a good example of the beginnings in Seagal's action hero decline. This was also a glaring example of Seagal's continuing chunky physique; I'm not one to harp on this as some do, but his limited movement does deter from the authenticity of his fight scenes...that said, at least he can absorb extra punishment and move more than one man around without it seeming less realistic.

    The latest Steven Seagal crime movie "The Glimmer Man" takes its title from the hero's dexterity and cunning at eliminating his foes before they can retaliate. Devoted fans of the real-life Aikido master will cheer their pony-tail hero as he demolishes his usual quota of thuggish villains who richly deserve every slap, smack, punch, and crackle they receive from Seagal as a way of atonement. What might upset them are the many variations that embellish this saga. No, "The Glimmer Man" isn't a message-laden, ecological nightmare that Seagal's earlier epic "On Deadly Ground" was. This Seagal vehicle grafts a creepy, whodunit, serial killer plot reminiscent of the 1995 Brad Pitt chiller "Se7en" onto a standard-issue police procedural. This time out we're allowed to laugh a little at the antics of Seagal and his newest sidekick, LAPD Detective Jim Campbell (Keenen Ivory Wayans of "A Lone Down Dirty Shame"), who gets to be the butt of our protagonist's pranks. The script allows Wayans to behave in a fashion that would appear inappropriate for the screen persona of Seagal's indestructible character. For instance, we get to see Wayans cry like a baby as he watches "Casablanca" in a downtown movie palace. Seagal's recent pictures have been overshadowed by his 1992 box office smash "Under Siege." "The Glimmer Man" represents an appeal to a more broadly defined audience, but nevertheless, it is more a watchable than most of his far-fetched fare. Steven Seagal's "Glimmer Man" character Jack Cole replicates the cop that he played in his cinematic debut "Hard to Kill" 9(1988) who had a hazy background as a CIA agent. Here, Seagal plays an ex-CIA assassin who plied his trade during the Vietnam War. As usual, Cole suffered from the lone wolf, "Dirty Harry," syndrome. Mystery cloaks Cole so thoroughly that Campbell (Wayans) cannot decide whether to trust him or arrest him. Gradually, our detective heroes discover that their suspicions about the serial murders are correct. They uncover an elaborate CIA/Russian Mafia plot to smuggle chemical weapons into the U.S. in a most interesting and original manner. Complicating matters is the actual serial slayer, Christopher Maynard (Stephen Tobolowsky of "Momento"), who lives up to his weirdness. Frank Deverell (Bob Gunton of "The Shawshank Redemption") is Seagal's chief adversary who masterminds the chemical weapons smuggling operation. As a CIA honcho, Mr. Smith (Brian Cox of "The Long Kiss Goodnight") brings urbanity and a touch of Dixie to his duplicitous dastard. Cox makes such a impassive but slimy villain that he deserves the abuse that Seagal delivers with glee. The real fun in any Seagal epic is the incredible way that he crushes his adversaries without suffering any payback. Nothing in "The Glimmer Man" matches the far-fetched scene where he escapes the hoodlums right after he emerged from a coma and pushes his own gurney out of the hospital. Another change here is the joke-swapping rapport between Seabal and the impeccably tailored Wayans. Seagal characters aren't known for either their levity or their pranks. They are typically a humorless, moribund breed of hero. Keenen Ivory Wayans' presence helps to lighten things up in this bizarre thriller. He gets shot at, his apartment blown up, and he falls out of a high-rise motel window. Wayans looks and dresses ultra-cool but he gets no more respects and twice the number of bruises than Seagal. Underlying the complicated plot is the budding relationship between Cole and Campbell as they pursue their investigation in its bl00dsplattered, pyrotechnical explosive finale. The humor and antics that develop between these two make "The Glimmer Man" more interesting than the usual Seagal opus. "The Glimmer Man" is a vast improvement over "On Deadly Ground" and "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory," but it is just another potboiler, albeit a polished one. The powdered deer penis scene is hilarious.

    I was told that this film was an action comedy, the blurb on the back specifically made reference to 'punches mixed with punchlines' and the Pulitzer Prize winning 'the wit hits the fan'. What I actually got was a very large, rusted nail heavily thumped into Seagal's credibility. This coming from the guy who'd watch Under Siege 2 several days earlier. The Glimmer Man is ACTUALLY an action-thriller film about two cops trying to find a serial killer called the Family Man because he kills and crucifies whole families, what a hoot! Add in a dash of political intrigued, Vietnam veterans and conspiracy and you have a flop. The problem with this film is that the gunfights are handled relatively well but the fist fights (Seagal's selling point) is so rapidly edited that you only ever see about two kick strung together before the footage cuts elsewhere. Watching classics martial arts films (I'm thinking Bruce Lee/Donnie Yen films here) is that the editing and filming actually shows off the skills of the fighters on display. That is not present in the Glimmer Man, So what you eventually have with this action comedy is a film that has very little comedy and the action is badly done. Not all is bad however, the plot is actually fairly reasonable and there are plenty of twists and turns that somehow command your attention and there is quite a lot of potential there but you somehow end up with a hugely forgettable film.

    Film Synopsis: Los Angeles is rocked by a serial killer known as the "Family Man", slaughtering entire families & placing their bodies in crucifixion poses. Jim Campbell, the investigating detective on the case, is paired with Jack Cole, a mysterious detective who wears Tibetan prayer beads, has formidable martial arts skills & acts a bit weird. When the Family Man's latest victim turns out to be Cole's ex-wife, Campbell faces the possibility that Cole might be the killer. The Review: When David Fincher's dark masterpiece SE7EN came out in the mid-1990s, it spawned a number of films featuring fiendishly clever serial killers trying to highlight the flaws of society by killing people. The Glimmer Man owes a fair amount to Se7en with its killer trying to save people by turning them into martyrs. At least for the first hour, anyway. What we have here is a film that is actually a routine action film disguised as a buddy cop flick disguised as a serial killer film. This dishonesty is really quite insulting to the intelligence of the viewers & fans of Fincher's film. The Glimmer Man uses the serial killer angle of the plot to mask a standard CIA conspiracy plot with an arms dealer sending his top assassin to terminate some witnesses to his latest arms deal, covering his tracks by disguising the executions as the work of the serial killer. The other main problem with The Glimmer Man is the fact that it is a Steven Seagal film. Steven Seagal is a martial artist who came to fame in the late 80s actioner ABOVE THE LAW, starring in films such as HARD TO KILL, MARKED FOR DEATH, OUT FOR JUSTICE & his all-time best work, UNDER SIEGE. Seagal's films are almost always extremely violent action films with really sadistic aikido moves courtesy of Seagal. Here he engages in some of his famed aikido skills, catapulting CIA goons through walls in a restaurant; as well as displaying a good dose of sadism  he takes on Russian gangsters with a knife disguised as a credit card; interrogates his old boss by shooting him in his hands & feet; & propels the arms dealer's son through a window. The Glimmer Man tries to balance the sadism with some humour, most notably in the partnership between Seagal & Keenen Ivory Wayans. But this fails mainly due to the fact that they obviously can't stand each other  Wayans' idea of comedy is to make unwholesome remarks about people behind their backs & inserting a running joke about him quaffing some powdered deer genitals, which is quite painful to watch. Seagal fares better in the comedy stakes, delivering some amusing one-liners. As far as acting goes, the cast are mostly competent. Besides Wayans, the only other actor to stumble is Brian Cox, who goes through the film with a campy performance that doesn't suit him.

    Not really a very insightful movie that one can study for hours and think about a lot. Rather this is more of a typical Hollywood action movie. Cops are partnered in regards to opposing personalities (which I love because when done properly, especially in this movie, it creates a really relaxed atmosphere), cars blow up at the sightest touch, and the hero runs around killing heaps of people and blowing up heaps of buildings and the captain at the end says, "Cole, I owe you an apology." Cole (Steven Segal) is playing his usual ex-special forces come cop or something role. Almost the same role that he played in Under Siege and On Deadly Ground (and no doubt numerous other movies before and after). As is typical, Steven Segal will encounter a horde of bad guys and he will typically beat them all up single handedly, and then walk out of the room dusting himself off. The plot is interesting though. Segal is a cop that hunts down serial killers, but has a rather sordid past: not only is it somewhat unknown, his recent past in regards to tracking down serial killers is tainted for he shot one when on a roof of a building in New York and there were no witnesses. Now he is in Los Angeles and a serial killer is attacking again, but this time there some one is going around killing people and using the serial killer to cover his tracks. As one delves in deeper, one uncovers a plot involving the Russian mafia. Once again, as it typical of a Steven Segal movie, there is lots of action and lots of martial arts. That alone would have been quite boring; one sees cars and petrol tankers blowing up every time one turns on the television. What made this movie cool was the backchat between the partners.

    "The Glimmer Man," directed in 1996 by John Gray, is yet another typical Steven Seagal martial arts-action/crime-thriller, but it is undoubtedly one of his better movies from his heyday. "Under Siege" was not perfect by any means upon its blockbuster release in 1992, but it is unquestionably Seagal's best movie to date (which unfortunately doesn't say much about his wildly hit-and-miss career as a whole). By '96, when "The Glimmer Man" was released, Seagal had become something of a walking parody of himself and a rather formulaic action star; the stoic Aikido martial arts master with a shady government-agent background was quickly wearing itself out. A worthy addition to the formula in "The Glimmer Man" had Seagal sharing screen-time with another star performer, comedian Keenen Ivory Wayans. In "The Glimmer Man," Seagal is Jack Cole, a former black ops mercenary who received his nickname because in the darkest jungles of Vietnam during the war, all you saw was a "glimmer of a man" (or so we're told), and then you'd be dead. Cole has since become a homicide detective with strong spiritual leanings (he wears Buddhist prayer beads throughout the film and is quite keen on Eastern religion and philosophy), first in New York and now in Los Angeles, where he's first partnered up with Det. Jim Campbell (Wayans). From the beginning, this movie takes a few pages from the "Se7en" (1995) play-book with trippy editing/cinematography and a serial killer called "The Family Man" (so-called because he murders entire households) with religious motivations behind his serial killings; "Se7en" was still quite popular around this time, hence the reference. Their investigation leads to a confrontation with shady businessman Frank Deverell (Bob Gunton), and a plot involving both The Family Man and murderous Russian mobsters. Another wrinkle comes from the fact that Cole's ex-wife is one of the most recent victims of The Family Man, and he is now a suspect. The reason I feel that "The Glimmer Man" is one of Seagal's better vehicles is because 1) there's a believable dynamic between himself and Keenen Ivory Wayans, which makes the movie feel a bit different from his usual stuff because of the added bits of humorous dialogue, and 2) it has some of his best fight/action sequences, despite the fact that it is one of his lesser-regarded films overall. The fights here are quite brutal (Wayans's Campbell character even gets a few punches in, too, including a battle with an intruder in his apartment) and Seagal finally has an opponent in the end who can actually match him in hand-to-hand combat scenes. "The Glimmer Man" is a Steven Seagal movie post-"Under Siege" that is worthy of a "glimmer" of honorable mention amongst his catalog of films. 7/10

    A curious Seagal/Keenan Ivory Wayans team-up we have here. I'm not sure these two even have chemistry but they are such an odd couple that somehow I couldn't help but be entertained. Wayans does his usual smart-alec schtick while Seagal is some ex-CIA mystery man who walks around in some sort of nehru outfit with beads around his neck. He proceeds to tell some gangsters that fighting is against his religion. After which he then proceeds to kick their asses to a bloody pulp and even uses a credit card to slice a dude's throat. Haha! Yep, that sounds like our Zen-Buddhist Mr. Non-Violence himself. Seagal is clearly putting on some weight here. But at least his movies are still hitting theaters at this point. Though it's clear that 1996 was the beginning of Seagal's decline. UNDER SIEGE 2 in 1995 was his last great film. Heck, that was his best film. But starting with 1996 his films began to flounder. Heck, that same year he basically had a cameo in Stuart Baird's exceptional EXECUTIVE DECISION - where he got sucked out into thin air during a botched plane-to-plane transfer. Kurt Russell ended up saving the day in that one. Anyway it wasn't long before Seagal began to team up with washed-up rappers/wanna-be actors in his films. Then he just went straight do DVD. I guess teaming up with dudes like DMX and Ja Rule is not a good career move. But here in this film this odd combo of Seagal and Wayans somehow works. The story is pretty crap. Heck, it's very crap. Something about some Russian mob tied to some rich businessman and the C.I.A. and then some stupid subplot about some religious fanatic killing families. So yes, very crap story. But Seagal and Wayans entertained me. And the way Seagal folds his hands across his chest (like some Dalai Lama) only to then beat a bunch of dudes into a bloody pulp is just a joy to witness. Haha! And the way he beats up these guys is pure comedy! He just tosses them around into walls, sharp objects, windows, etc. without even breaking a sweat. I guess by 1996 Seagal didn't need to use actual aikido skills. He was just in this zen-like state where he could just push a dude and that was enough to maim him. And if that wasn't enough then he would just smack him across the face a few times and that would most certainly kill the sucker. Hilarious!!

    Jack Cole is a soft spoken, mystical, new age New York cop with a checkered past. He is transferred to Los Angeles to help Los Angeles cop Jim Campbell solve a series of brutal murders in which the victims are crucified. The murders that have happened since Jack arrived in Los Angeles just don't sit right with him. When the killer, known as the "Family Man", kills Ellen DunLeavy, who happens to be Jack's ex wife and the mother of his two kids, and Ellen's husband Andrew DunLeavy, it becomes personal - especially when Jack's prints are found on Ellen's body. Jack meets with his military mentor Smith, not knowing that Smith is in cahoots with local crime boss Frank Deverell..... This is probably the last prolific film Seagal released in the nineties, and it's a wonderful oddity of a movie. Mixing Se7en, with Lethal weapon is a strange combo, but the film makers and the two leads make this work very well, with the mixture of action and darkness just about balanced. Seagal and Wayans seem awkward as partners at first, but the humour is surprisingly intimate between the two, which makes them more believable as eventual friends. The story is exactly what you'd expect from a Seagal film, playing somebody with a shady past and a silly nickname (Seagal is the titular character), but it doesn't really need any attention, so it's best just to concentrate on the action scenes, which are very well choreographed, and very violent. he film has a very Gothic feel to it, which might deter other action fans, as it doesn't feel like a typical Seagal movie. With good support from Gunton and Cox (who was in every film in 1996) the Glimmer Man is a refreshing action movie, which deserved to do a little better at the box office.

He gets shot at, his apartment blown up, and he falls out of a high-rise motel window. Wayans looks and dresses ultra-cool but he gets no more respects and twice the number of bruises than Seagal. Underlying the complicated plot is the budding relationship between Cole and Campbell as they pursue their investigation in its bl00dsplattered, pyrotechnical explosive finale. The humor and antics that develop between these two make "The Glimmer Man" more interesting than the usual Seagal opus. "The Glimmer Man" is a vast improvement over "On Deadly Ground" and "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory," but it is just another potboiler, albeit a polished one. The powdered deer penis scene is hilarious.

    I was told that this film was an action comedy, the blurb on the back specifically made reference to 'punches mixed with punchlines' and the Pulitzer Prize winning 'the wit hits the fan'. What I actually got was a very large, rusted nail heavily thumped into Seagal's credibility. This coming from the guy who'd watch Under Siege 2 several days earlier. The Glimmer Man is ACTUALLY an action-thriller film about two cops trying to find a serial killer called the Family Man because he kills and crucifies whole families, what a hoot! Add in a dash of political intrigued, Vietnam veterans and conspiracy and you have a flop. The problem with this film is that the gunfights are handled relatively well but the fist fights (Seagal's selling point) is so rapidly edited that you only ever see about two kick strung together before the footage cuts elsewhere. Watching classics martial arts films (I'm thinking Bruce Lee/Donnie Yen films here) is that the editing and filming actually shows off the skills of the fighters on display. That is not present in the Glimmer Man, So what you eventually have with this action comedy is a film that has very little comedy and the action is badly done. Not all is bad however, the plot is actually fairly reasonable and there are plenty of twists and turns that somehow command your attention and there is quite a lot of potential there but you somehow end up with a hugely forgettable film.

    Film Synopsis: Los Angeles is rocked by a serial killer known as the "Family Man", slaughtering entire families & placing their bodies in crucifixion poses. Jim Campbell, the investigating detective on the case, is paired with Jack Cole, a mysterious detective who wears Tibetan prayer beads, has formidable martial arts skills & acts a bit weird. When the Family Man's latest victim turns out to be Cole's ex-wife, Campbell faces the possibility that Cole might be the killer. The Review: When David Fincher's dark masterpiece SE7EN came out in the mid-1990s, it spawned a number of films featuring fiendishly clever serial killers trying to highlight the flaws of society by killing people. The Glimmer Man owes a fair amount to Se7en with its killer trying to save people by turning them into martyrs. At least for the first hour, anyway. What we have here is a film that is actually a routine action film disguised as a buddy cop flick disguised as a serial killer film. This dishonesty is really quite insulting to the intelligence of the viewers & fans of Fincher's film. The Glimmer Man uses the serial killer angle of the plot to mask a standard CIA conspiracy plot with an arms dealer sending his top assassin to terminate some witnesses to his latest arms deal, covering his tracks by disguising the executions as the work of the serial killer. The other main problem with The Glimmer Man is the fact that it is a Steven Seagal film. Steven Seagal is a martial artist who came to fame in the late 80s actioner ABOVE THE LAW, starring in films such as HARD TO KILL, MARKED FOR DEATH, OUT FOR JUSTICE & his all-time best work, UNDER SIEGE. Seagal's films are almost always extremely violent action films with really sadistic aikido moves courtesy of Seagal. Here he engages in some of his famed aikido skills, catapulting CIA goons through walls in a restaurant; as well as displaying a good dose of sadism  he takes on Russian gangsters with a knife disguised as a credit card; interrogates his old boss by shooting him in his hands & feet; & propels the arms dealer's son through a window. The Glimmer Man tries to balance the sadism with some humour, most notably in the partnership between Seagal & Keenen Ivory Wayans. But this fails mainly due to the fact that they obviously can't stand each other  Wayans' idea of comedy is to make unwholesome remarks about people behind their backs & inserting a running joke about him quaffing some powdered deer genitals, which is quite painful to watch. Seagal fares better in the comedy stakes, delivering some amusing one-liners. As far as acting goes, the cast are mostly competent. Besides Wayans, the only other actor to stumble is Brian Cox, who goes through the film with a campy performance that doesn't suit him.

    Not really a very insightful movie that one can study for hours and think about a lot. Rather this is more of a typical Hollywood action movie. Cops are partnered in regards to opposing personalities (which I love because when done properly, especially in this movie, it creates a really relaxed atmosphere), cars blow up at the sightest touch, and the hero runs around killing heaps of people and blowing up heaps of buildings and the captain at the end says, "Cole, I owe you an apology." Cole (Steven Segal) is playing his usual ex-special forces come cop or something role. Almost the same role that he played in Under Siege and On Deadly Ground (and no doubt numerous other movies before and after). As is typical, Steven Segal will encounter a horde of bad guys and he will typically beat them all up single handedly, and then walk out of the room dusting himself off. The plot is interesting though. Segal is a cop that hunts down serial killers, but has a rather sordid past: not only is it somewhat unknown, his recent past in regards to tracking down serial killers is tainted for he shot one when on a roof of a building in New York and there were no witnesses. Now he is in Los Angeles and a serial killer is attacking again, but this time there some one is going around killing people and using the serial killer to cover his tracks. As one delves in deeper, one uncovers a plot involving the Russian mafia. Once again, as it typical of a Steven Segal movie, there is lots of action and lots of martial arts. That alone would have been quite boring; one sees cars and petrol tankers blowing up every time one turns on the television. What made this movie cool was the backchat between the partners.

    "The Glimmer Man," directed in 1996 by John Gray, is yet another typical Steven Seagal martial arts-action/crime-thriller, but it is undoubtedly one of his better movies from his heyday. "Under Siege" was not perfect by any means upon its blockbuster release in 1992, but it is unquestionably Seagal's best movie to date (which unfortunately doesn't say much about his wildly hit-and-miss career as a whole). By '96, when "The Glimmer Man" was released, Seagal had become something of a walking parody of himself and a rather formulaic action star; the stoic Aikido martial arts master with a shady government-agent background was quickly wearing itself out. A worthy addition to the formula in "The Glimmer Man" had Seagal sharing screen-time with another star performer, comedian Keenen Ivory Wayans. In "The Glimmer Man," Seagal is Jack Cole, a former black ops mercenary who received his nickname because in the darkest jungles of Vietnam during the war, all you saw was a "glimmer of a man" (or so we're told), and then you'd be dead. Cole has since become a homicide detective with strong spiritual leanings (he wears Buddhist prayer beads throughout the film and is quite keen on Eastern religion and philosophy), first in New York and now in Los Angeles, where he's first partnered up with Det. Jim Campbell (Wayans). From the beginning, this movie takes a few pages from the "Se7en" (1995) play-book with trippy editing/cinematography and a serial killer called "The Family Man" (so-called because he murders entire households) with religious motivations behind his serial killings; "Se7en" was still quite popular around this time, hence the reference. Their investigation leads to a confrontation with shady businessman Frank Deverell (Bob Gunton), and a plot involving both The Family Man and murderous Russian mobsters. Another wrinkle comes from the fact that Cole's ex-wife is one of the most recent victims of The Family Man, and he is now a suspect. The reason I feel that "The Glimmer Man" is one of Seagal's better vehicles is because 1) there's a believable dynamic between himself and Keenen Ivory Wayans, which makes the movie feel a bit different from his usual stuff because of the added bits of humorous dialogue, and 2) it has some of his best fight/action sequences, despite the fact that it is one of his lesser-regarded films overall. The fights here are quite brutal (Wayans's Campbell character even gets a few punches in, too, including a battle with an intruder in his apartment) and Seagal finally has an opponent in the end who can actually match him in hand-to-hand combat scenes. "The Glimmer Man" is a Steven Seagal movie post-"Under Siege" that is worthy of a "glimmer" of honorable mention amongst his catalog of films. 7/10

    A curious Seagal/Keenan Ivory Wayans team-up we have here. I'm not sure these two even have chemistry but they are such an odd couple that somehow I couldn't help but be entertained. Wayans does his usual smart-alec schtick while Seagal is some ex-CIA mystery man who walks around in some sort of nehru outfit with beads around his neck. He proceeds to tell some gangsters that fighting is against his religion. After which he then proceeds to kick their asses to a bloody pulp and even uses a credit card to slice a dude's throat. Haha! Yep, that sounds like our Zen-Buddhist Mr. Non-Violence himself. Seagal is clearly putting on some weight here. But at least his movies are still hitting theaters at this point. Though it's clear that 1996 was the beginning of Seagal's decline. UNDER SIEGE 2 in 1995 was his last great film. Heck, that was his best film. But starting with 1996 his films began to flounder. Heck, that same year he basically had a cameo in Stuart Baird's exceptional EXECUTIVE DECISION - where he got sucked out into thin air during a botched plane-to-plane transfer. Kurt Russell ended up saving the day in that one. Anyway it wasn't long before Seagal began to team up with washed-up rappers/wanna-be actors in his films. Then he just went straight do DVD. I guess teaming up with dudes like DMX and Ja Rule is not a good career move. But here in this film this odd combo of Seagal and Wayans somehow works. The story is pretty crap. Heck, it's very crap. Something about some Russian mob tied to some rich businessman and the C.I.A. and then some stupid subplot about some religious fanatic killing families. So yes, very crap story. But Seagal and Wayans entertained me. And the way Seagal folds his hands across his chest (like some Dalai Lama) only to then beat a bunch of dudes into a bloody pulp is just a joy to witness. Haha! And the way he beats up these guys is pure comedy! He just tosses them around into walls, sharp objects, windows, etc. without even breaking a sweat. I guess by 1996 Seagal didn't need to use actual aikido skills. He was just in this zen-like state where he could just push a dude and that was enough to maim him. And if that wasn't enough then he would just smack him across the face a few times and that would most certainly kill the sucker. Hilarious!!

    Jack Cole is a soft spoken, mystical, new age New York cop with a checkered past. He is transferred to Los Angeles to help Los Angeles cop Jim Campbell solve a series of brutal murders in which the victims are crucified. The murders that have happened since Jack arrived in Los Angeles just don't sit right with him. When the killer, known as the "Family Man", kills Ellen DunLeavy, who happens to be Jack's ex wife and the mother of his two kids, and Ellen's husband Andrew DunLeavy, it becomes personal - especially when Jack's prints are found on Ellen's body. Jack meets with his military mentor Smith, not knowing that Smith is in cahoots with local crime boss Frank Deverell..... This is probably the last prolific film Seagal released in the nineties, and it's a wonderful oddity of a movie. Mixing Se7en, with Lethal weapon is a strange combo, but the film makers and the two leads make this work very well, with the mixture of action and darkness just about balanced. Seagal and Wayans seem awkward as partners at first, but the humour is surprisingly intimate between the two, which makes them more believable as eventual friends. The story is exactly what you'd expect from a Seagal film, playing somebody with a shady past and a silly nickname (Seagal is the titular character), but it doesn't really need any attention, so it's best just to concentrate on the action scenes, which are very well choreographed, and very violent. he film has a very Gothic feel to it, which might deter other action fans, as it doesn't feel like a typical Seagal movie. With good support from Gunton and Cox (who was in every film in 1996) the Glimmer Man is a refreshing action movie, which deserved to do a little better at the box office.

    Aw,Steve,I love you,man.Ever since I saw "Under Siege"I have recommended your work to friends(some of whom,oddly,no longer call)and await each new addition to the canon with breathless eagerness. With "The Glimmer Man"You have truly blossomed out as a multi - lingual polymath. And you can kick arse and take names.That fight in the restaurant was quite exquisitely choreographed and brilliantly funny. No longer are you satisfied with being the new Buster Keaton(see my review of "Under Siege"),my guess is Woody Allen had better be looking over his shoulder real soon. You don't need a plot,just point the camera and give both your facial expressions,man.And kick arse and take names,obviously. My friend went to your Country and Western show in Worthing and said you were great.Unfortunately I couldn't make it 'cos I'm still considered a danger to the public. Bummer,man.

    The only reason this movie was made is probably to satisfy Seagal's huge ego . THE WHOLE MOVIE is basically a non stop marathon about how Seagal's character is awesome , tough , smart , handsome and bla bla bla bla . Someone here needs a therapy  Anyway , that's the biggest problem of the movie . I quickly became annoyed with all this Seagal worship that doesn't end until the ending credits appear. Even sticking to well liked by audiences formula of buddy cop movie isn't able to save the movie . Maybe because Wayans isn't one bit funny. "The Glimmer man" tries to have a dark atmosphere like "Se7en" , but fails . Not to mention that the whole movie feels low budget made for  TV movie . In the end the movie makers tried desperately to impress the audience at least with violence , yet it comes out like a cheap shock. Story ? What story ? Action ? Typical unimpressive Seagal style. Avoid it . I give it 1/10.

    A practicing-Buddhist detective (Steven Seagal) joins forces with a wise-cracking, LA cop (Damon Wayans) on the cases of a serial killer called The Family Man who intrudes on the homes of families, shooting them in the foreheads point blank (the gun, equipped with silencer), then displaying them in the ritualistic form of the Crucifix, spiked to their bedroom walls. Soon, however, Seagal realizes that certain murders might be imitations, meant to resemble those of The Family Man, in actuality tied to chemical weapons smuggled and meant for sale to terrorists. Wayans loses his home, and suffers great harm to his person, thanks to his association with Seagal. I did think I would like this a little more than I did. Sure, Seagal has the requisite fight scene where he hurls men through tables, across the bar, through windows, and crashing into displays and walls, with broken bottles and faces as a result. There's a treasure of villainy, including Brian Cox as a CIA government man from Seagal's past, Bob Gunton (Shawshank Redemption) as the one responsible for negotiating the weapons trade with the Russian mob, Stephen Tobolowsky as The Family Man (who Seagal must kill in a Catholic Church much to his dismay after repeated warnings), and John M Jackson as Gunton's enforcer soon turning on his boss. Jackson is the unfortunate final bad guy and the eventual recipient of a major ass-whooping. I honestly think the feeling of familiarity with the plot and action scenes (the serial killing subplot shows us some grisly crime scenes but the approach to solving them is uninspired; this is more about the--yawn-- weapons smuggling uncovering than removing a serial killer from the streets) hurts The Glimmer Man. Yes, faces are beaten to a bloody and battered pulp, and Seagal's hands still move at warp speed when he destroys his foes, but I found myself just wanting more this time around. Wayans tries to use his sense of humor to save the day, and Seagal looks as relaxed and comfortable as I have ever seen him; but, the film simply lacks grit and intensity (there's also that energy missing) needed considering what the heroes are up against. This is a good example of the beginnings in Seagal's action hero decline. This was also a glaring example of Seagal's continuing chunky physique; I'm not one to harp on this as some do, but his limited movement does deter from the authenticity of his fight scenes...that said, at least he can absorb extra punishment and move more than one man around without it seeming less realistic.

    The latest Steven Seagal crime movie "The Glimmer Man" takes its title from the hero's dexterity and cunning at eliminating his foes before they can retaliate. Devoted fans of the real-life Aikido master will cheer their pony-tail hero as he demolishes his usual quota of thuggish villains who richly deserve every slap, smack, punch, and crackle they receive from Seagal as a way of atonement. What might upset them are the many variations that embellish this saga. No, "The Glimmer Man" isn't a message-laden, ecological nightmare that Seagal's earlier epic "On Deadly Ground" was. This Seagal vehicle grafts a creepy, whodunit, serial killer plot reminiscent of the 1995 Brad Pitt chiller "Se7en" onto a standard-issue police procedural. This time out we're allowed to laugh a little at the antics of Seagal and his newest sidekick, LAPD Detective Jim Campbell (Keenen Ivory Wayans of "A Lone Down Dirty Shame"), who gets to be the butt of our protagonist's pranks. The script allows Wayans to behave in a fashion that would appear inappropriate for the screen persona of Seagal's indestructible character. For instance, we get to see Wayans cry like a baby as he watches "Casablanca" in a downtown movie palace. Seagal's recent pictures have been overshadowed by his 1992 box office smash "Under Siege." "The Glimmer Man" represents an appeal to a more broadly defined audience, but nevertheless, it is more a watchable than most of his far-fetched fare. Steven Seagal's "Glimmer Man" character Jack Cole replicates the cop that he played in his cinematic debut "Hard to Kill" 9(1988) who had a hazy background as a CIA agent. Here, Seagal plays an ex-CIA assassin who plied his trade during the Vietnam War. As usual, Cole suffered from the lone wolf, "Dirty Harry," syndrome. Mystery cloaks Cole so thoroughly that Campbell (Wayans) cannot decide whether to trust him or arrest him. Gradually, our detective heroes discover that their suspicions about the serial murders are correct. They uncover an elaborate CIA/Russian Mafia plot to smuggle chemical weapons into the U.S. in a most interesting and original manner. Complicating matters is the actual serial slayer, Christopher Maynard (Stephen Tobolowsky of "Momento"), who lives up to his weirdness. Frank Deverell (Bob Gunton of "The Shawshank Redemption") is Seagal's chief adversary who masterminds the chemical weapons smuggling operation. As a CIA honcho, Mr. Smith (Brian Cox of "The Long Kiss Goodnight") brings urbanity and a touch of Dixie to his duplicitous dastard. Cox makes such a impassive but slimy villain that he deserves the abuse that Seagal delivers with glee. The real fun in any Seagal epic is the incredible way that he crushes his adversaries without suffering any payback. Nothing in "The Glimmer Man" matches the far-fetched scene where he escapes the hoodlums right after he emerged from a coma and pushes his own gurney out of the hospital. Another change here is the joke-swapping rapport between Seabal and the impeccably tailored Wayans. Seagal characters aren't known for either their levity or their pranks. They are typically a humorless, moribund breed of hero. Keenen Ivory Wayans' presence helps to lighten things up in this bizarre thriller. He gets shot at, his apartment blown up, and he falls out of a high-rise motel window. Wayans looks and dresses ultra-cool but he gets no more respects and twice the number of bruises than Seagal. Underlying the complicated plot is the budding relationship between Cole and Campbell as they pursue their investigation in its bl00dsplattered, pyrotechnical explosive finale. The humor and antics that develop between these two make "The Glimmer Man" more interesting than the usual Seagal opus. "The Glimmer Man" is a vast improvement over "On Deadly Ground" and "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory," but it is just another potboiler, albeit a polished one. The powdered deer penis scene is hilarious.

In "The Glimmer Man," Seagal is Jack Cole, a former black ops mercenary who received his nickname because in the darkest jungles of Vietnam during the war, all you saw was a "glimmer of a man" (or so we're told), and then you'd be dead. Cole has since become a homicide detective with strong spiritual leanings (he wears Buddhist prayer beads throughout the film and is quite keen on Eastern religion and philosophy), first in New York and now in Los Angeles, where he's first partnered up with Det. Jim Campbell (Wayans). From the beginning, this movie takes a few pages from the "Se7en" (1995) play-book with trippy editing/cinematography and a serial killer called "The Family Man" (so-called because he murders entire households) with religious motivations behind his serial killings; "Se7en" was still quite popular around this time, hence the reference. Their investigation leads to a confrontation with shady businessman Frank Deverell (Bob Gunton), and a plot involving both The Family Man and murderous Russian mobsters. Another wrinkle comes from the fact that Cole's ex-wife is one of the most recent victims of The Family Man, and he is now a suspect. The reason I feel that "The Glimmer Man" is one of Seagal's better vehicles is because 1) there's a believable dynamic between himself and Keenen Ivory Wayans, which makes the movie feel a bit different from his usual stuff because of the added bits of humorous dialogue, and 2) it has some of his best fight/action sequences, despite the fact that it is one of his lesser-regarded films overall. The fights here are quite brutal (Wayans's Campbell character even gets a few punches in, too, including a battle with an intruder in his apartment) and Seagal finally has an opponent in the end who can actually match him in hand-to-hand combat scenes. "The Glimmer Man" is a Steven Seagal movie post-"Under Siege" that is worthy of a "glimmer" of honorable mention amongst his catalog of films. 7/10

    A curious Seagal/Keenan Ivory Wayans team-up we have here. I'm not sure these two even have chemistry but they are such an odd couple that somehow I couldn't help but be entertained. Wayans does his usual smart-alec schtick while Seagal is some ex-CIA mystery man who walks around in some sort of nehru outfit with beads around his neck. He proceeds to tell some gangsters that fighting is against his religion. After which he then proceeds to kick their asses to a bloody pulp and even uses a credit card to slice a dude's throat. Haha! Yep, that sounds like our Zen-Buddhist Mr. Non-Violence himself. Seagal is clearly putting on some weight here. But at least his movies are still hitting theaters at this point. Though it's clear that 1996 was the beginning of Seagal's decline. UNDER SIEGE 2 in 1995 was his last great film. Heck, that was his best film. But starting with 1996 his films began to flounder. Heck, that same year he basically had a cameo in Stuart Baird's exceptional EXECUTIVE DECISION - where he got sucked out into thin air during a botched plane-to-plane transfer. Kurt Russell ended up saving the day in that one. Anyway it wasn't long before Seagal began to team up with washed-up rappers/wanna-be actors in his films. Then he just went straight do DVD. I guess teaming up with dudes like DMX and Ja Rule is not a good career move. But here in this film this odd combo of Seagal and Wayans somehow works. The story is pretty crap. Heck, it's very crap. Something about some Russian mob tied to some rich businessman and the C.I.A. and then some stupid subplot about some religious fanatic killing families. So yes, very crap story. But Seagal and Wayans entertained me. And the way Seagal folds his hands across his chest (like some Dalai Lama) only to then beat a bunch of dudes into a bloody pulp is just a joy to witness. Haha! And the way he beats up these guys is pure comedy! He just tosses them around into walls, sharp objects, windows, etc. without even breaking a sweat. I guess by 1996 Seagal didn't need to use actual aikido skills. He was just in this zen-like state where he could just push a dude and that was enough to maim him. And if that wasn't enough then he would just smack him across the face a few times and that would most certainly kill the sucker. Hilarious!!

    Jack Cole is a soft spoken, mystical, new age New York cop with a checkered past. He is transferred to Los Angeles to help Los Angeles cop Jim Campbell solve a series of brutal murders in which the victims are crucified. The murders that have happened since Jack arrived in Los Angeles just don't sit right with him. When the killer, known as the "Family Man", kills Ellen DunLeavy, who happens to be Jack's ex wife and the mother of his two kids, and Ellen's husband Andrew DunLeavy, it becomes personal - especially when Jack's prints are found on Ellen's body. Jack meets with his military mentor Smith, not knowing that Smith is in cahoots with local crime boss Frank Deverell..... This is probably the last prolific film Seagal released in the nineties, and it's a wonderful oddity of a movie. Mixing Se7en, with Lethal weapon is a strange combo, but the film makers and the two leads make this work very well, with the mixture of action and darkness just about balanced. Seagal and Wayans seem awkward as partners at first, but the humour is surprisingly intimate between the two, which makes them more believable as eventual friends. The story is exactly what you'd expect from a Seagal film, playing somebody with a shady past and a silly nickname (Seagal is the titular character), but it doesn't really need any attention, so it's best just to concentrate on the action scenes, which are very well choreographed, and very violent. he film has a very Gothic feel to it, which might deter other action fans, as it doesn't feel like a typical Seagal movie. With good support from Gunton and Cox (who was in every film in 1996) the Glimmer Man is a refreshing action movie, which deserved to do a little better at the box office.

    Aw,Steve,I love you,man.Ever since I saw "Under Siege"I have recommended your work to friends(some of whom,oddly,no longer call)and await each new addition to the canon with breathless eagerness. With "The Glimmer Man"You have truly blossomed out as a multi - lingual polymath. And you can kick arse and take names.That fight in the restaurant was quite exquisitely choreographed and brilliantly funny. No longer are you satisfied with being the new Buster Keaton(see my review of "Under Siege"),my guess is Woody Allen had better be looking over his shoulder real soon. You don't need a plot,just point the camera and give both your facial expressions,man.And kick arse and take names,obviously. My friend went to your Country and Western show in Worthing and said you were great.Unfortunately I couldn't make it 'cos I'm still considered a danger to the public. Bummer,man.
