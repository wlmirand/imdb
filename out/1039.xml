 <sinopse>
  Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, returns home to find his father murdered and his mother remarrying the murderer, his uncle. Meanwhile, war is brewing.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Hamlet, son of the king of Denmark, is summoned home for his father's funeral and his mother's wedding to his uncle. In a supernatural episode, he discovers that his uncle, whom he hates anyway, murdered his father. In an incredibly convoluted plot--the most complicated and most interesting in all literature--he manages to (impossible to put this in exact order) feign (or perhaps not to feign) madness, murder the "prime minister," love and then unlove an innocent whom he drives to madness, plot and then unplot against the uncle, direct a play within a play, successfully conspire against the lives of two well-meaning friends, and finally take his revenge on the uncle, but only at the cost of almost every life on stage, including his own and his mother's.

    Keeping this brief, but I remember this version so fondly....and am a huge fan of actor/director/screenplay adapter Branagh. I am prompted to write because I haven't seen this one lately but yesterday saw Tony Richardson's Hamlet starring Nicol Williamson. How it made me appreciate THIS ONE. It is SO much better. There's almost no comparison. Branagh's Hamlet has more shades of color and complexity, more depth. He's the right age, and his mother and stepfather actually look older than he, which is not the case in the Hamlet with Williamson. Horatio is the right age to be his pal in Branagh's version-- is that too much to ask, a Horatio that does not look quite a bit older than Claudius? The play is not cut to ribbons, either, which is what we find in the Nicol Williamson version of Hamlet. In fact, it's the whole play, what a concept. Anyway I have not seen Branagh's Hamlet recently enough to give it a serious review, I only want to say that watching the truncated, miscast one from director Tony Richardson made me appreciate just how great this version is, how much it affected me when I saw it.

    The devil is in the details for Shakespeare. While the words are important, reading between the lines often gives the greatest fulfillment. Someone tell Kenneth Branagh. As a direct and unabridged reading, this Hamlet holds every word to sacrosanct, so it is ultimately the superior PRODUCTION of Hamlet we've yet seen. Or at least a noble attempt, though even this "full" text is disputed as definitive. As a movie, however, I cannot rate this as anything other than a failure for a very simple reason. Why? It isn't the massive sets, or large format photography. But they don't quite save Hamlet either. One could always point to good old English "irony" or "juxtaposition" in such a bright and jolly looking adaptation of what is a dark story of a hallucinating and suicidal boy struggling with the betrayals of his step-father, or perhaps the mother? But for me, it does not hold. Lavish, yes, appropriate? ehÂ… It isn't the cast, but some choices may leave you scratching Yorick. Robin Williams, Heston and Billy Crystal? While they seemingly were picked up for novelty and not drama, they aren't what bring down this movie either. There are some heavyweights in here, but the movie is notably missing the riveting ghost of Paul Scofield and Ian Holm's layered Polonius from the pop Franco Zeffirelli job. There's really no interpretation at all. A clear sign the movie was not actually directed but simply read aloud. No, what dooms this production of Hamlet for me isn't the 70mm photography, trendy casting, Ben Hur visuals or boomy music. What sinks Hamlet is the actor playing the lead character. Kenneth Branagh plays this part so removed from sympathy and his delivery is so grating, I actually wanted to poison him myself from the first moment he appeared on screen. From his Peter Pan appearance to skippy mannerisms, I could only see this Dane on the label of a peanut butter jar with a ear to ear grin. Hamlet is crazy, but he needs to be at least a little sympathetic to the audience. I could only root for the villain. For the very first time, it was quite sad to see Jakobi's Claudius go at the end. Branagh clearly knows all the words, but he's just a mime. This isn't Hamlet, it's Kenneth Branagh for four hours.

    This was long. 4 hours of uncondensed Shakespeare and I must say I enjoyed it. Kenneth Branagh is perhaps the Laurence Oliver of our times. A great actor obsessed with the work of Shakespeare. And this is his masterpiece, Hamlet (1996), a free uncondensed version with every line of what Shakespeare has written, on the last movie ,besides The Master, filmed on 70mm film. If you've graduated high school, you probably know the story of Hamlet. Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his father, who request the he kills his uncle, the new king of Denmark, because he murdered Hamlet's father. What I love about this adaptation is the things Kenneth Branagh does because he's using the medium of film. The use of Flashbacks in events is a great use that the stage adaptations could never do, same with the scenery. Elsinore Castle comes alive. It was genius for him to set the story in the 19th century. It gives a beautiful touch to the movie and costumes and set design were appropriate. THe final thing he does great is how he plays Hamlet. My English teacher taught him more as a mopey Dane, but he plays him as a cunning but indecisive genius which I believe is more interesting. His soliloquies have great touch to them, using visual elements and artful expression to make them interesting instead if Rambling. The cast is great too. No weak link in the acting, and everyone holds their own. The guest appearances of famous actors, Charlton Heston, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal add moments of freshness to secondary characters. The Cinematography shows off the world well and fits most scenes, same with the music. The problem is the length. It drags in places and with trimming could've been a masterful movie. Overall great adaptation (better than the Mel Gibson one) and shows off to a new generation the beauty and power of something written 400 years ago. If you have the time, check it out. 8/10

    Branagh's version of "Hamlet" is clearly the most successful screen adaptation of this immortal classic. While I can't absolutely compare Branagh's acting skills to the brilliant acting technique of Sir Laurence Olivier in his acclaimed version of Hamlet, it is clear that he managed to bring the wit,the critic to his society,the striking reflections on life and death,the projected madness and ultimately the melancholia of Prince Hamlet. Nevertheless Kenneth Branagh is the second best Hamlet ever seen in a film and he plays all the emotions attributed to Hamlet.Furthermore, his direction is visionary and original in every-way. The supporting cast is what made "Hamlet" unique compared to the previous adaptation. Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet are unattainable. Each of them gives the exact nature of their characters and plays their role with complete identification, expressing all the feelings and thoughts hidden in their troubled souls.The other actors in their minor roles play equally effectively. The set is visually striking and the music adds a sense of enormous tragedy.

    Kenneth Branaugh deserves a lot of credit for taking risks in his adaptation of Hamlet. He chooses to present the text uncut, something that pretty much nobody does, but which realizes aspects of the text that are usually ignored, like the geopolitical threat that the characters ignore to their peril. (It also includes a lot of overblown navel-gazing that is usually justly excised.) Far from the dark and gloomy atmosphere we usually see Hamlet presented in, Branaugh fills the screen of light, suggesting the former glory of the now debased court. While all this is interesting, there are a lot of problems with this adaptation. Branaugh is a bit too old and definitely too hammy to take seriously as Hamlet, and the ridiculous goatee he sports throughout the film doesn't help. The other actors come off better -- Derek Jacobi has a particularly good turn as Claudius -- but there's still a pervading odour of cheese, and the great drama of Hamlet frequently tips over into melodrama. Despite the bold choices he makes, Branaugh is ultimately using the aesthetics of a Hollywood blockbuster, and they're as shallow as ever. It's hard for an adaptation of Hamlet to be really bad, especially one as faithful as this: the iconic characters and the forceful plot are enough to carry even the limpest adaptation to something fairly decent. Still, the whole thing feels like a failed experiment, and you could probably see a better take on Hamlet at a local theatre show. So while Branaugh's ambitions deserve respect, he doesn't really have the chops to pull them off, no matter how many famous actors he pulls in.

    Sad to say, this is a very bad Hamlet and a very bad film: badly-directed, badly-designed, badly-shot, badly-staged, and worst of all badly-acted. Branagh is a ranting child, Derek Jacobi effete and spinsterish, Horatio a pill, Laertes an unsightly runt, Charlton Heston inappropriately granitic (the First Player is supposed to be an emotive actor, remember?), Polonius neither funny nor formidable, Jack Lemmon an embarrassment, Billy Crystal ditto, Kate Winslet all gush and baby-fat, Julie Christie merely decorative, etc., etc. The obvious under-budgeting doesn't help: the sets are tacky (that graveyard!), the process shots appalling, and much of the action is confined to a Hall of Mirrors, probably the single most inflexible set ever designed for a production of Hamlet. As director, Branagh uses every trick in the book to hold our presumably flagging attentions: pointlessly swirling camera movements, equally pointless flashbacks and insets (Priam and Hecuba?), playing Patrick Doyle's oppressive score almost constantly over the dialogue. As actor, his performance is trivial when it isn't grating. Deficient in physical presence, intellectual heft and emotional complexity, he races through his lines till their sense becomes garbled and sometimes resorts to a screaming mode for which he hasn't the voice. In brief, he plays Hamlet as an ordinary young man who's gotten in a little over his head, which is a poor description of Hamlet but a spot-on description of Branagh.

    This is without a doubt the worst Shakespeare adaptation I've ever seen. That includes Baz Luhrmann's nauseating "Romeo + Juliet." I wasn't really sure what to expect going in-- no expectations whatsoever. Except that it would be a full-text adaptation of the play, something so unusual it was surrounded by a good deal of pomp and praise upon the film's initial release. Surely it was a brave thing to do, but was it in the best interests of the story? Absolutely not. In reality, "Hamlet" was probably never performed in its entirety even in Shakespeare's day. I was never a big fan of Branagh, but he did a reasonably good job with "Much Ado About Nothing," both directing and starring. Sadly it's the only halfway decent thing he's ever done. His "Hamlet" is most foul. It takes a great actor and a great director to be able to police oneself well enough to take on both roles in one of the most famous stories of all time. Branagh fails miserably. The film is largely constructed on two gimmicks-- the first being the percentage of text used (100%, obviously) and the second being its jarring update from medieval to 19th-century Denmark. The first gimmick mortally wounds the film right off the bat. Characters either pompously expound for minutes on end or shout with breakneck speed just to fit it all in. As for the second gimmick, it doesn't serve the story at all. It merely serves to distract us. After all, the primary reason to update the setting of a Shakespearean play is to make some kind of statement. It worked in "Titus," and, in theory, even worked in "Romeo + Juliet." But all it says here is, "I'm Kenneth Branagh and I can do whatever I want." The performances are so-so at best (Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet) and gut-wrenchingly awful on average (Branagh, Branagh, and more Branagh). It was nice to see Charlton Heston doing serious work again as the Player King, but crucial casting missteps were made virtually across the board, the worst being Robin Williams as Osric and Jack Lemmon as Marcellus. Indeed the film had almost as many irritatingly pointless "cameos" as "The Greatest Story Ever Told." Say what you will about Mel Gibson. But his performance as Hamlet, mediocre though it was, is leaps and bounds over Branagh's because Gibson had an amazing director, Franco Zeffirelli. Branagh merely thought his own director was great. His ridiculous arrogance bleeds through every frame. No movie in history has ever been so difficult to sit through, so gimmicky, so over-produced *and* so self-indulgent. Siskel and Ebert was right-- it does show Branagh's virtuosity. His virtuosity at making horrible decisions because he wanted to. The Bard would be disappointed to say the least.

    This 1996 film, directed and adapted by Kenneth Branagh, is Hamlet re-imagined as a 1960s epic: 4 hours long (complete with intermission), shot in 70mm widescreen and featuring star names in small roles. But whereas the 60s epics always looked to exotic climates, this remains anglo-centric in filling its panavision lens - shot at Shepperton Studios with some exteriors at Blenheim Place in Oxfordshire. Production designer Tim Harvey creates an Elsinore which is a huge and brightly lit 19th century palace with a central hall surrounded by mirrored doors and a chessboard floor. This isn't the usual darkly lit medieval castle of previous versions. The unabridged 4 hour text means this is often a very talkative film, but is also gives greater weight to supporting characters and Claudius's role is considerable larger than in either the 1948 or 1990 versions. And yet the film never feels over-long. Branagh is fine as Hamlet, supported by an excellent cast of English actors including Julie Christie as Gertrude, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, Derek Jacobi as Claudius and Richard Briers as Polonius. Jacobi is outstanding, speaking every line with crystal clarity. But what will attract most people to the movie is the all-star supporting cast in minor roles: Jack Lemmon as a guard, Billy Crystal as the grave digger, Charlton Heston as the Player King, as well as Gerard Depardieu, Robin Williams and Judi Dench. There's even John Gielgud and Ken Dodd in non-speaking roles. A remarkable achievement and amongst the finest Shakespearian adaptations ever committed to film.

    Kenneth Branaugh's 'Hamlet' is the first film version of Shakepeare's play to have been filmed with all of the content put back in. At 234 minutes it is never boring but shows the work of a director in love with this classic play. What we get from this longer version (the first in which not a single line has been trimmed) is that the characters motives become that much clearer. Studying Hamlet in school I had a hard time understanding how Hamlet's girl Ophelia went mad. Here the motivation is not only clearer but we see her in the process of her madness. We get from this version a wonderful performance by Kenneth Branaugh as the young prince who gets a visit from his father's ghost to inform him that it was his uncle that murdered him and now occupies the throne and the bed chamber of Hamlet's mother. But how to accuse the king of murder without making everyone think that you've gone completely mad? Most of the versions of this play have trimmed the fat and only given us the bare bones. This film is able to explain a few things and more, to help me understand motivations the play's message of mortality. I have never been able to understand how Claudius was able to convince sister-in-law Gertrude to marry him so soon after the king's death. Derek Jacobi brings such charm to the role that it's not only clear how he charmed he new wife but how he masterminded his brother's death as well. Much to our surprise and dismay, we sort of begin to understand why he did it. Key pieces of dialogue have been restored that flesh out the characters even more. Branaugh knows that the dialogue is key to the characters but also understands that the atmosphere of the castle plays a key role as well. The production design by Tim Harvey and Desmond Crowe are breathtaking suggesting a court of infinite secrets, not just a medieval castle of horrors. The opening scenes at the wedding of Claudius and Gertrude is a sight to behold with a hall that seems to stretch back and back and back into infinity. The throne room with it's wall of mirrors, some of which are passageways, leads to one of the most original scenes Â– Hamlet's To be or Not to be soliloquy spoken to a mirror with people hiding behind it. Is he talking to them or his own reflection? Are his questions in the reflection coming back at him? Then something else happens that I've never seen before in any version of Hamlet Â– a flashback of Yorich. During his scene in the graveyard he begins questioning the skull of the king's favorite buck-toothed clown. We flash back to the time when he played horsey with the young Hamlet. Then a close-up and a dissolve to the skull in Hamlet's hands with the buck-teeth still in it. The question of mortality remains but in Kenneth Branaugh's hands it hits home. Branaugh's performance as Hamlet is never morbid or redundant. He lashes out, overplays and uses wild gestures as he masterminds a plan to bring his uncle's guilt to the surface without making everyone think that the prince himself has gone off his rocker. This is key because making Hamlet into a pitiful slump distracts from what he does later in the play. He wonders about the matters of life and death, both physical and spiritual but Branaugh does it with curiosity not misery. I have never been so entertained by a filmed version of Shakespeare. Branaugh throws away the stogy, stagy elements that turn many people off of Shakespeare. But he really brings this film to life, not just the words but the actions. This is a man completely in love with this masterful play, he knows it we sense and I for one am grateful to have witnessed it.

    As far as Branagh's Shakespeare film adaptations go, this is one of the better ones. I personally preferred Much Ado About Nothing(1993), but Hamlet is one fine film. My only gripes are some of the cameos. Charlton Heston is good, but while it was nice to see Jack Lemmon he was too old I agree and Billy Crystal and Robin Williams come across as too modern and silly. Michael Maloney is okay but doesn't quite work appearance wise. Gripes aside, visually it is very striking. The settings are gorgeous, the costumes are equally exquisite and the cinematography is very skillful. The music score is a score of haunting, rousing and melancholic beauty, and enhances the film so well. The dialogue is still wonderful, and the story still has its emotional punch. The cast do a great job together. Kenneth Branagh directs with real vigour and does a fine job as Hamlet. Julie Christie is very good as Gertrude, Richard Briers is a good Polonious and Kate Winslet is a beautiful and poignant Orphelia. As the scheming villainous Claudius though, Derek Jacobi comes off best, his performance is brilliant. In conclusion, a fine adaptation and one of Branagh's better overall films. 9/10 Bethany Cox

Despite the bold choices he makes, Branaugh is ultimately using the aesthetics of a Hollywood blockbuster, and they're as shallow as ever. It's hard for an adaptation of Hamlet to be really bad, especially one as faithful as this: the iconic characters and the forceful plot are enough to carry even the limpest adaptation to something fairly decent. Still, the whole thing feels like a failed experiment, and you could probably see a better take on Hamlet at a local theatre show. So while Branaugh's ambitions deserve respect, he doesn't really have the chops to pull them off, no matter how many famous actors he pulls in.

    Sad to say, this is a very bad Hamlet and a very bad film: badly-directed, badly-designed, badly-shot, badly-staged, and worst of all badly-acted. Branagh is a ranting child, Derek Jacobi effete and spinsterish, Horatio a pill, Laertes an unsightly runt, Charlton Heston inappropriately granitic (the First Player is supposed to be an emotive actor, remember?), Polonius neither funny nor formidable, Jack Lemmon an embarrassment, Billy Crystal ditto, Kate Winslet all gush and baby-fat, Julie Christie merely decorative, etc., etc. The obvious under-budgeting doesn't help: the sets are tacky (that graveyard!), the process shots appalling, and much of the action is confined to a Hall of Mirrors, probably the single most inflexible set ever designed for a production of Hamlet. As director, Branagh uses every trick in the book to hold our presumably flagging attentions: pointlessly swirling camera movements, equally pointless flashbacks and insets (Priam and Hecuba?), playing Patrick Doyle's oppressive score almost constantly over the dialogue. As actor, his performance is trivial when it isn't grating. Deficient in physical presence, intellectual heft and emotional complexity, he races through his lines till their sense becomes garbled and sometimes resorts to a screaming mode for which he hasn't the voice. In brief, he plays Hamlet as an ordinary young man who's gotten in a little over his head, which is a poor description of Hamlet but a spot-on description of Branagh.

    This is without a doubt the worst Shakespeare adaptation I've ever seen. That includes Baz Luhrmann's nauseating "Romeo + Juliet." I wasn't really sure what to expect going in-- no expectations whatsoever. Except that it would be a full-text adaptation of the play, something so unusual it was surrounded by a good deal of pomp and praise upon the film's initial release. Surely it was a brave thing to do, but was it in the best interests of the story? Absolutely not. In reality, "Hamlet" was probably never performed in its entirety even in Shakespeare's day. I was never a big fan of Branagh, but he did a reasonably good job with "Much Ado About Nothing," both directing and starring. Sadly it's the only halfway decent thing he's ever done. His "Hamlet" is most foul. It takes a great actor and a great director to be able to police oneself well enough to take on both roles in one of the most famous stories of all time. Branagh fails miserably. The film is largely constructed on two gimmicks-- the first being the percentage of text used (100%, obviously) and the second being its jarring update from medieval to 19th-century Denmark. The first gimmick mortally wounds the film right off the bat. Characters either pompously expound for minutes on end or shout with breakneck speed just to fit it all in. As for the second gimmick, it doesn't serve the story at all. It merely serves to distract us. After all, the primary reason to update the setting of a Shakespearean play is to make some kind of statement. It worked in "Titus," and, in theory, even worked in "Romeo + Juliet." But all it says here is, "I'm Kenneth Branagh and I can do whatever I want." The performances are so-so at best (Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet) and gut-wrenchingly awful on average (Branagh, Branagh, and more Branagh). It was nice to see Charlton Heston doing serious work again as the Player King, but crucial casting missteps were made virtually across the board, the worst being Robin Williams as Osric and Jack Lemmon as Marcellus. Indeed the film had almost as many irritatingly pointless "cameos" as "The Greatest Story Ever Told." Say what you will about Mel Gibson. But his performance as Hamlet, mediocre though it was, is leaps and bounds over Branagh's because Gibson had an amazing director, Franco Zeffirelli. Branagh merely thought his own director was great. His ridiculous arrogance bleeds through every frame. No movie in history has ever been so difficult to sit through, so gimmicky, so over-produced *and* so self-indulgent. Siskel and Ebert was right-- it does show Branagh's virtuosity. His virtuosity at making horrible decisions because he wanted to. The Bard would be disappointed to say the least.

    This 1996 film, directed and adapted by Kenneth Branagh, is Hamlet re-imagined as a 1960s epic: 4 hours long (complete with intermission), shot in 70mm widescreen and featuring star names in small roles. But whereas the 60s epics always looked to exotic climates, this remains anglo-centric in filling its panavision lens - shot at Shepperton Studios with some exteriors at Blenheim Place in Oxfordshire. Production designer Tim Harvey creates an Elsinore which is a huge and brightly lit 19th century palace with a central hall surrounded by mirrored doors and a chessboard floor. This isn't the usual darkly lit medieval castle of previous versions. The unabridged 4 hour text means this is often a very talkative film, but is also gives greater weight to supporting characters and Claudius's role is considerable larger than in either the 1948 or 1990 versions. And yet the film never feels over-long. Branagh is fine as Hamlet, supported by an excellent cast of English actors including Julie Christie as Gertrude, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, Derek Jacobi as Claudius and Richard Briers as Polonius. Jacobi is outstanding, speaking every line with crystal clarity. But what will attract most people to the movie is the all-star supporting cast in minor roles: Jack Lemmon as a guard, Billy Crystal as the grave digger, Charlton Heston as the Player King, as well as Gerard Depardieu, Robin Williams and Judi Dench. There's even John Gielgud and Ken Dodd in non-speaking roles. A remarkable achievement and amongst the finest Shakespearian adaptations ever committed to film.

    Kenneth Branaugh's 'Hamlet' is the first film version of Shakepeare's play to have been filmed with all of the content put back in. At 234 minutes it is never boring but shows the work of a director in love with this classic play. What we get from this longer version (the first in which not a single line has been trimmed) is that the characters motives become that much clearer. Studying Hamlet in school I had a hard time understanding how Hamlet's girl Ophelia went mad. Here the motivation is not only clearer but we see her in the process of her madness. We get from this version a wonderful performance by Kenneth Branaugh as the young prince who gets a visit from his father's ghost to inform him that it was his uncle that murdered him and now occupies the throne and the bed chamber of Hamlet's mother. But how to accuse the king of murder without making everyone think that you've gone completely mad? Most of the versions of this play have trimmed the fat and only given us the bare bones. This film is able to explain a few things and more, to help me understand motivations the play's message of mortality. I have never been able to understand how Claudius was able to convince sister-in-law Gertrude to marry him so soon after the king's death. Derek Jacobi brings such charm to the role that it's not only clear how he charmed he new wife but how he masterminded his brother's death as well. Much to our surprise and dismay, we sort of begin to understand why he did it. Key pieces of dialogue have been restored that flesh out the characters even more. Branaugh knows that the dialogue is key to the characters but also understands that the atmosphere of the castle plays a key role as well. The production design by Tim Harvey and Desmond Crowe are breathtaking suggesting a court of infinite secrets, not just a medieval castle of horrors. The opening scenes at the wedding of Claudius and Gertrude is a sight to behold with a hall that seems to stretch back and back and back into infinity. The throne room with it's wall of mirrors, some of which are passageways, leads to one of the most original scenes Â– Hamlet's To be or Not to be soliloquy spoken to a mirror with people hiding behind it. Is he talking to them or his own reflection? Are his questions in the reflection coming back at him? Then something else happens that I've never seen before in any version of Hamlet Â– a flashback of Yorich. During his scene in the graveyard he begins questioning the skull of the king's favorite buck-toothed clown. We flash back to the time when he played horsey with the young Hamlet. Then a close-up and a dissolve to the skull in Hamlet's hands with the buck-teeth still in it. The question of mortality remains but in Kenneth Branaugh's hands it hits home. Branaugh's performance as Hamlet is never morbid or redundant. He lashes out, overplays and uses wild gestures as he masterminds a plan to bring his uncle's guilt to the surface without making everyone think that the prince himself has gone off his rocker. This is key because making Hamlet into a pitiful slump distracts from what he does later in the play. He wonders about the matters of life and death, both physical and spiritual but Branaugh does it with curiosity not misery. I have never been so entertained by a filmed version of Shakespeare. Branaugh throws away the stogy, stagy elements that turn many people off of Shakespeare. But he really brings this film to life, not just the words but the actions. This is a man completely in love with this masterful play, he knows it we sense and I for one am grateful to have witnessed it.

    As far as Branagh's Shakespeare film adaptations go, this is one of the better ones. I personally preferred Much Ado About Nothing(1993), but Hamlet is one fine film. My only gripes are some of the cameos. Charlton Heston is good, but while it was nice to see Jack Lemmon he was too old I agree and Billy Crystal and Robin Williams come across as too modern and silly. Michael Maloney is okay but doesn't quite work appearance wise. Gripes aside, visually it is very striking. The settings are gorgeous, the costumes are equally exquisite and the cinematography is very skillful. The music score is a score of haunting, rousing and melancholic beauty, and enhances the film so well. The dialogue is still wonderful, and the story still has its emotional punch. The cast do a great job together. Kenneth Branagh directs with real vigour and does a fine job as Hamlet. Julie Christie is very good as Gertrude, Richard Briers is a good Polonious and Kate Winslet is a beautiful and poignant Orphelia. As the scheming villainous Claudius though, Derek Jacobi comes off best, his performance is brilliant. In conclusion, a fine adaptation and one of Branagh's better overall films. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    Keeping this brief, but I remember this version so fondly....and am a huge fan of actor/director/screenplay adapter Branagh. I am prompted to write because I haven't seen this one lately but yesterday saw Tony Richardson's Hamlet starring Nicol Williamson. How it made me appreciate THIS ONE. It is SO much better. There's almost no comparison. Branagh's Hamlet has more shades of color and complexity, more depth. He's the right age, and his mother and stepfather actually look older than he, which is not the case in the Hamlet with Williamson. Horatio is the right age to be his pal in Branagh's version-- is that too much to ask, a Horatio that does not look quite a bit older than Claudius? The play is not cut to ribbons, either, which is what we find in the Nicol Williamson version of Hamlet. In fact, it's the whole play, what a concept. Anyway I have not seen Branagh's Hamlet recently enough to give it a serious review, I only want to say that watching the truncated, miscast one from director Tony Richardson made me appreciate just how great this version is, how much it affected me when I saw it.

    The devil is in the details for Shakespeare. While the words are important, reading between the lines often gives the greatest fulfillment. Someone tell Kenneth Branagh. As a direct and unabridged reading, this Hamlet holds every word to sacrosanct, so it is ultimately the superior PRODUCTION of Hamlet we've yet seen. Or at least a noble attempt, though even this "full" text is disputed as definitive. As a movie, however, I cannot rate this as anything other than a failure for a very simple reason. Why? It isn't the massive sets, or large format photography. But they don't quite save Hamlet either. One could always point to good old English "irony" or "juxtaposition" in such a bright and jolly looking adaptation of what is a dark story of a hallucinating and suicidal boy struggling with the betrayals of his step-father, or perhaps the mother? But for me, it does not hold. Lavish, yes, appropriate? ehÂ… It isn't the cast, but some choices may leave you scratching Yorick. Robin Williams, Heston and Billy Crystal? While they seemingly were picked up for novelty and not drama, they aren't what bring down this movie either. There are some heavyweights in here, but the movie is notably missing the riveting ghost of Paul Scofield and Ian Holm's layered Polonius from the pop Franco Zeffirelli job. There's really no interpretation at all. A clear sign the movie was not actually directed but simply read aloud. No, what dooms this production of Hamlet for me isn't the 70mm photography, trendy casting, Ben Hur visuals or boomy music. What sinks Hamlet is the actor playing the lead character. Kenneth Branagh plays this part so removed from sympathy and his delivery is so grating, I actually wanted to poison him myself from the first moment he appeared on screen. From his Peter Pan appearance to skippy mannerisms, I could only see this Dane on the label of a peanut butter jar with a ear to ear grin. Hamlet is crazy, but he needs to be at least a little sympathetic to the audience. I could only root for the villain. For the very first time, it was quite sad to see Jakobi's Claudius go at the end. Branagh clearly knows all the words, but he's just a mime. This isn't Hamlet, it's Kenneth Branagh for four hours.

    This was long. 4 hours of uncondensed Shakespeare and I must say I enjoyed it. Kenneth Branagh is perhaps the Laurence Oliver of our times. A great actor obsessed with the work of Shakespeare. And this is his masterpiece, Hamlet (1996), a free uncondensed version with every line of what Shakespeare has written, on the last movie ,besides The Master, filmed on 70mm film. If you've graduated high school, you probably know the story of Hamlet. Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his father, who request the he kills his uncle, the new king of Denmark, because he murdered Hamlet's father. What I love about this adaptation is the things Kenneth Branagh does because he's using the medium of film. The use of Flashbacks in events is a great use that the stage adaptations could never do, same with the scenery. Elsinore Castle comes alive. It was genius for him to set the story in the 19th century. It gives a beautiful touch to the movie and costumes and set design were appropriate. THe final thing he does great is how he plays Hamlet. My English teacher taught him more as a mopey Dane, but he plays him as a cunning but indecisive genius which I believe is more interesting. His soliloquies have great touch to them, using visual elements and artful expression to make them interesting instead if Rambling. The cast is great too. No weak link in the acting, and everyone holds their own. The guest appearances of famous actors, Charlton Heston, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal add moments of freshness to secondary characters. The Cinematography shows off the world well and fits most scenes, same with the music. The problem is the length. It drags in places and with trimming could've been a masterful movie. Overall great adaptation (better than the Mel Gibson one) and shows off to a new generation the beauty and power of something written 400 years ago. If you have the time, check it out. 8/10

    Branagh's version of "Hamlet" is clearly the most successful screen adaptation of this immortal classic. While I can't absolutely compare Branagh's acting skills to the brilliant acting technique of Sir Laurence Olivier in his acclaimed version of Hamlet, it is clear that he managed to bring the wit,the critic to his society,the striking reflections on life and death,the projected madness and ultimately the melancholia of Prince Hamlet. Nevertheless Kenneth Branagh is the second best Hamlet ever seen in a film and he plays all the emotions attributed to Hamlet.Furthermore, his direction is visionary and original in every-way. The supporting cast is what made "Hamlet" unique compared to the previous adaptation. Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet are unattainable. Each of them gives the exact nature of their characters and plays their role with complete identification, expressing all the feelings and thoughts hidden in their troubled souls.The other actors in their minor roles play equally effectively. The set is visually striking and the music adds a sense of enormous tragedy.

    Kenneth Branaugh deserves a lot of credit for taking risks in his adaptation of Hamlet. He chooses to present the text uncut, something that pretty much nobody does, but which realizes aspects of the text that are usually ignored, like the geopolitical threat that the characters ignore to their peril. (It also includes a lot of overblown navel-gazing that is usually justly excised.) Far from the dark and gloomy atmosphere we usually see Hamlet presented in, Branaugh fills the screen of light, suggesting the former glory of the now debased court. While all this is interesting, there are a lot of problems with this adaptation. Branaugh is a bit too old and definitely too hammy to take seriously as Hamlet, and the ridiculous goatee he sports throughout the film doesn't help. The other actors come off better -- Derek Jacobi has a particularly good turn as Claudius -- but there's still a pervading odour of cheese, and the great drama of Hamlet frequently tips over into melodrama. Despite the bold choices he makes, Branaugh is ultimately using the aesthetics of a Hollywood blockbuster, and they're as shallow as ever. It's hard for an adaptation of Hamlet to be really bad, especially one as faithful as this: the iconic characters and the forceful plot are enough to carry even the limpest adaptation to something fairly decent. Still, the whole thing feels like a failed experiment, and you could probably see a better take on Hamlet at a local theatre show. So while Branaugh's ambitions deserve respect, he doesn't really have the chops to pull them off, no matter how many famous actors he pulls in.

    As far as Branagh's Shakespeare film adaptations go, this is one of the better ones. I personally preferred Much Ado About Nothing(1993), but Hamlet is one fine film. My only gripes are some of the cameos. Charlton Heston is good, but while it was nice to see Jack Lemmon he was too old I agree and Billy Crystal and Robin Williams come across as too modern and silly. Michael Maloney is okay but doesn't quite work appearance wise. Gripes aside, visually it is very striking. The settings are gorgeous, the costumes are equally exquisite and the cinematography is very skillful. The music score is a score of haunting, rousing and melancholic beauty, and enhances the film so well. The dialogue is still wonderful, and the story still has its emotional punch. The cast do a great job together. Kenneth Branagh directs with real vigour and does a fine job as Hamlet. Julie Christie is very good as Gertrude, Richard Briers is a good Polonious and Kate Winslet is a beautiful and poignant Orphelia. As the scheming villainous Claudius though, Derek Jacobi comes off best, his performance is brilliant. In conclusion, a fine adaptation and one of Branagh's better overall films. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    Keeping this brief, but I remember this version so fondly....and am a huge fan of actor/director/screenplay adapter Branagh. I am prompted to write because I haven't seen this one lately but yesterday saw Tony Richardson's Hamlet starring Nicol Williamson. How it made me appreciate THIS ONE. It is SO much better. There's almost no comparison. Branagh's Hamlet has more shades of color and complexity, more depth. He's the right age, and his mother and stepfather actually look older than he, which is not the case in the Hamlet with Williamson. Horatio is the right age to be his pal in Branagh's version-- is that too much to ask, a Horatio that does not look quite a bit older than Claudius? The play is not cut to ribbons, either, which is what we find in the Nicol Williamson version of Hamlet. In fact, it's the whole play, what a concept. Anyway I have not seen Branagh's Hamlet recently enough to give it a serious review, I only want to say that watching the truncated, miscast one from director Tony Richardson made me appreciate just how great this version is, how much it affected me when I saw it.

    The devil is in the details for Shakespeare. While the words are important, reading between the lines often gives the greatest fulfillment. Someone tell Kenneth Branagh. As a direct and unabridged reading, this Hamlet holds every word to sacrosanct, so it is ultimately the superior PRODUCTION of Hamlet we've yet seen. Or at least a noble attempt, though even this "full" text is disputed as definitive. As a movie, however, I cannot rate this as anything other than a failure for a very simple reason. Why? It isn't the massive sets, or large format photography. But they don't quite save Hamlet either. One could always point to good old English "irony" or "juxtaposition" in such a bright and jolly looking adaptation of what is a dark story of a hallucinating and suicidal boy struggling with the betrayals of his step-father, or perhaps the mother? But for me, it does not hold. Lavish, yes, appropriate? ehÂ… It isn't the cast, but some choices may leave you scratching Yorick. Robin Williams, Heston and Billy Crystal? While they seemingly were picked up for novelty and not drama, they aren't what bring down this movie either. There are some heavyweights in here, but the movie is notably missing the riveting ghost of Paul Scofield and Ian Holm's layered Polonius from the pop Franco Zeffirelli job. There's really no interpretation at all. A clear sign the movie was not actually directed but simply read aloud. No, what dooms this production of Hamlet for me isn't the 70mm photography, trendy casting, Ben Hur visuals or boomy music. What sinks Hamlet is the actor playing the lead character. Kenneth Branagh plays this part so removed from sympathy and his delivery is so grating, I actually wanted to poison him myself from the first moment he appeared on screen. From his Peter Pan appearance to skippy mannerisms, I could only see this Dane on the label of a peanut butter jar with a ear to ear grin. Hamlet is crazy, but he needs to be at least a little sympathetic to the audience. I could only root for the villain. For the very first time, it was quite sad to see Jakobi's Claudius go at the end. Branagh clearly knows all the words, but he's just a mime. This isn't Hamlet, it's Kenneth Branagh for four hours.

    This was long. 4 hours of uncondensed Shakespeare and I must say I enjoyed it. Kenneth Branagh is perhaps the Laurence Oliver of our times. A great actor obsessed with the work of Shakespeare. And this is his masterpiece, Hamlet (1996), a free uncondensed version with every line of what Shakespeare has written, on the last movie ,besides The Master, filmed on 70mm film. If you've graduated high school, you probably know the story of Hamlet. Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his father, who request the he kills his uncle, the new king of Denmark, because he murdered Hamlet's father. What I love about this adaptation is the things Kenneth Branagh does because he's using the medium of film. The use of Flashbacks in events is a great use that the stage adaptations could never do, same with the scenery. Elsinore Castle comes alive. It was genius for him to set the story in the 19th century. It gives a beautiful touch to the movie and costumes and set design were appropriate. THe final thing he does great is how he plays Hamlet. My English teacher taught him more as a mopey Dane, but he plays him as a cunning but indecisive genius which I believe is more interesting. His soliloquies have great touch to them, using visual elements and artful expression to make them interesting instead if Rambling. The cast is great too. No weak link in the acting, and everyone holds their own. The guest appearances of famous actors, Charlton Heston, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal add moments of freshness to secondary characters. The Cinematography shows off the world well and fits most scenes, same with the music. The problem is the length. It drags in places and with trimming could've been a masterful movie. Overall great adaptation (better than the Mel Gibson one) and shows off to a new generation the beauty and power of something written 400 years ago. If you have the time, check it out. 8/10

    Branagh's version of "Hamlet" is clearly the most successful screen adaptation of this immortal classic. While I can't absolutely compare Branagh's acting skills to the brilliant acting technique of Sir Laurence Olivier in his acclaimed version of Hamlet, it is clear that he managed to bring the wit,the critic to his society,the striking reflections on life and death,the projected madness and ultimately the melancholia of Prince Hamlet. Nevertheless Kenneth Branagh is the second best Hamlet ever seen in a film and he plays all the emotions attributed to Hamlet.Furthermore, his direction is visionary and original in every-way. The supporting cast is what made "Hamlet" unique compared to the previous adaptation. Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet are unattainable. Each of them gives the exact nature of their characters and plays their role with complete identification, expressing all the feelings and thoughts hidden in their troubled souls.The other actors in their minor roles play equally effectively. The set is visually striking and the music adds a sense of enormous tragedy.

    Kenneth Branaugh deserves a lot of credit for taking risks in his adaptation of Hamlet. He chooses to present the text uncut, something that pretty much nobody does, but which realizes aspects of the text that are usually ignored, like the geopolitical threat that the characters ignore to their peril. (It also includes a lot of overblown navel-gazing that is usually justly excised.) Far from the dark and gloomy atmosphere we usually see Hamlet presented in, Branaugh fills the screen of light, suggesting the former glory of the now debased court. While all this is interesting, there are a lot of problems with this adaptation. Branaugh is a bit too old and definitely too hammy to take seriously as Hamlet, and the ridiculous goatee he sports throughout the film doesn't help. The other actors come off better -- Derek Jacobi has a particularly good turn as Claudius -- but there's still a pervading odour of cheese, and the great drama of Hamlet frequently tips over into melodrama. Despite the bold choices he makes, Branaugh is ultimately using the aesthetics of a Hollywood blockbuster, and they're as shallow as ever. It's hard for an adaptation of Hamlet to be really bad, especially one as faithful as this: the iconic characters and the forceful plot are enough to carry even the limpest adaptation to something fairly decent. Still, the whole thing feels like a failed experiment, and you could probably see a better take on Hamlet at a local theatre show. So while Branaugh's ambitions deserve respect, he doesn't really have the chops to pull them off, no matter how many famous actors he pulls in.

    Sad to say, this is a very bad Hamlet and a very bad film: badly-directed, badly-designed, badly-shot, badly-staged, and worst of all badly-acted. Branagh is a ranting child, Derek Jacobi effete and spinsterish, Horatio a pill, Laertes an unsightly runt, Charlton Heston inappropriately granitic (the First Player is supposed to be an emotive actor, remember?), Polonius neither funny nor formidable, Jack Lemmon an embarrassment, Billy Crystal ditto, Kate Winslet all gush and baby-fat, Julie Christie merely decorative, etc., etc. The obvious under-budgeting doesn't help: the sets are tacky (that graveyard!), the process shots appalling, and much of the action is confined to a Hall of Mirrors, probably the single most inflexible set ever designed for a production of Hamlet. As director, Branagh uses every trick in the book to hold our presumably flagging attentions: pointlessly swirling camera movements, equally pointless flashbacks and insets (Priam and Hecuba?), playing Patrick Doyle's oppressive score almost constantly over the dialogue. As actor, his performance is trivial when it isn't grating. Deficient in physical presence, intellectual heft and emotional complexity, he races through his lines till their sense becomes garbled and sometimes resorts to a screaming mode for which he hasn't the voice. In brief, he plays Hamlet as an ordinary young man who's gotten in a little over his head, which is a poor description of Hamlet but a spot-on description of Branagh.

    This is without a doubt the worst Shakespeare adaptation I've ever seen. That includes Baz Luhrmann's nauseating "Romeo + Juliet." I wasn't really sure what to expect going in-- no expectations whatsoever. Except that it would be a full-text adaptation of the play, something so unusual it was surrounded by a good deal of pomp and praise upon the film's initial release. Surely it was a brave thing to do, but was it in the best interests of the story? Absolutely not. In reality, "Hamlet" was probably never performed in its entirety even in Shakespeare's day. I was never a big fan of Branagh, but he did a reasonably good job with "Much Ado About Nothing," both directing and starring. Sadly it's the only halfway decent thing he's ever done. His "Hamlet" is most foul. It takes a great actor and a great director to be able to police oneself well enough to take on both roles in one of the most famous stories of all time. Branagh fails miserably. The film is largely constructed on two gimmicks-- the first being the percentage of text used (100%, obviously) and the second being its jarring update from medieval to 19th-century Denmark. The first gimmick mortally wounds the film right off the bat. Characters either pompously expound for minutes on end or shout with breakneck speed just to fit it all in. As for the second gimmick, it doesn't serve the story at all. It merely serves to distract us. After all, the primary reason to update the setting of a Shakespearean play is to make some kind of statement. It worked in "Titus," and, in theory, even worked in "Romeo + Juliet." But all it says here is, "I'm Kenneth Branagh and I can do whatever I want." The performances are so-so at best (Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet) and gut-wrenchingly awful on average (Branagh, Branagh, and more Branagh). It was nice to see Charlton Heston doing serious work again as the Player King, but crucial casting missteps were made virtually across the board, the worst being Robin Williams as Osric and Jack Lemmon as Marcellus. Indeed the film had almost as many irritatingly pointless "cameos" as "The Greatest Story Ever Told." Say what you will about Mel Gibson. But his performance as Hamlet, mediocre though it was, is leaps and bounds over Branagh's because Gibson had an amazing director, Franco Zeffirelli. Branagh merely thought his own director was great. His ridiculous arrogance bleeds through every frame. No movie in history has ever been so difficult to sit through, so gimmicky, so over-produced *and* so self-indulgent. Siskel and Ebert was right-- it does show Branagh's virtuosity. His virtuosity at making horrible decisions because he wanted to. The Bard would be disappointed to say the least.

    This 1996 film, directed and adapted by Kenneth Branagh, is Hamlet re-imagined as a 1960s epic: 4 hours long (complete with intermission), shot in 70mm widescreen and featuring star names in small roles. But whereas the 60s epics always looked to exotic climates, this remains anglo-centric in filling its panavision lens - shot at Shepperton Studios with some exteriors at Blenheim Place in Oxfordshire. Production designer Tim Harvey creates an Elsinore which is a huge and brightly lit 19th century palace with a central hall surrounded by mirrored doors and a chessboard floor. This isn't the usual darkly lit medieval castle of previous versions. The unabridged 4 hour text means this is often a very talkative film, but is also gives greater weight to supporting characters and Claudius's role is considerable larger than in either the 1948 or 1990 versions. And yet the film never feels over-long. Branagh is fine as Hamlet, supported by an excellent cast of English actors including Julie Christie as Gertrude, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, Derek Jacobi as Claudius and Richard Briers as Polonius. Jacobi is outstanding, speaking every line with crystal clarity. But what will attract most people to the movie is the all-star supporting cast in minor roles: Jack Lemmon as a guard, Billy Crystal as the grave digger, Charlton Heston as the Player King, as well as Gerard Depardieu, Robin Williams and Judi Dench. There's even John Gielgud and Ken Dodd in non-speaking roles. A remarkable achievement and amongst the finest Shakespearian adaptations ever committed to film.

    Kenneth Branaugh's 'Hamlet' is the first film version of Shakepeare's play to have been filmed with all of the content put back in. At 234 minutes it is never boring but shows the work of a director in love with this classic play. What we get from this longer version (the first in which not a single line has been trimmed) is that the characters motives become that much clearer. Studying Hamlet in school I had a hard time understanding how Hamlet's girl Ophelia went mad. Here the motivation is not only clearer but we see her in the process of her madness. We get from this version a wonderful performance by Kenneth Branaugh as the young prince who gets a visit from his father's ghost to inform him that it was his uncle that murdered him and now occupies the throne and the bed chamber of Hamlet's mother. But how to accuse the king of murder without making everyone think that you've gone completely mad? Most of the versions of this play have trimmed the fat and only given us the bare bones. This film is able to explain a few things and more, to help me understand motivations the play's message of mortality. I have never been able to understand how Claudius was able to convince sister-in-law Gertrude to marry him so soon after the king's death. Derek Jacobi brings such charm to the role that it's not only clear how he charmed he new wife but how he masterminded his brother's death as well. Much to our surprise and dismay, we sort of begin to understand why he did it. Key pieces of dialogue have been restored that flesh out the characters even more. Branaugh knows that the dialogue is key to the characters but also understands that the atmosphere of the castle plays a key role as well. The production design by Tim Harvey and Desmond Crowe are breathtaking suggesting a court of infinite secrets, not just a medieval castle of horrors. The opening scenes at the wedding of Claudius and Gertrude is a sight to behold with a hall that seems to stretch back and back and back into infinity. The throne room with it's wall of mirrors, some of which are passageways, leads to one of the most original scenes Â– Hamlet's To be or Not to be soliloquy spoken to a mirror with people hiding behind it. Is he talking to them or his own reflection? Are his questions in the reflection coming back at him? Then something else happens that I've never seen before in any version of Hamlet Â– a flashback of Yorich. During his scene in the graveyard he begins questioning the skull of the king's favorite buck-toothed clown. We flash back to the time when he played horsey with the young Hamlet. Then a close-up and a dissolve to the skull in Hamlet's hands with the buck-teeth still in it. The question of mortality remains but in Kenneth Branaugh's hands it hits home. Branaugh's performance as Hamlet is never morbid or redundant. He lashes out, overplays and uses wild gestures as he masterminds a plan to bring his uncle's guilt to the surface without making everyone think that the prince himself has gone off his rocker. This is key because making Hamlet into a pitiful slump distracts from what he does later in the play. He wonders about the matters of life and death, both physical and spiritual but Branaugh does it with curiosity not misery. I have never been so entertained by a filmed version of Shakespeare. Branaugh throws away the stogy, stagy elements that turn many people off of Shakespeare. But he really brings this film to life, not just the words but the actions. This is a man completely in love with this masterful play, he knows it we sense and I for one am grateful to have witnessed it.

    Sad to say, this is a very bad Hamlet and a very bad film: badly-directed, badly-designed, badly-shot, badly-staged, and worst of all badly-acted. Branagh is a ranting child, Derek Jacobi effete and spinsterish, Horatio a pill, Laertes an unsightly runt, Charlton Heston inappropriately granitic (the First Player is supposed to be an emotive actor, remember?), Polonius neither funny nor formidable, Jack Lemmon an embarrassment, Billy Crystal ditto, Kate Winslet all gush and baby-fat, Julie Christie merely decorative, etc., etc. The obvious under-budgeting doesn't help: the sets are tacky (that graveyard!), the process shots appalling, and much of the action is confined to a Hall of Mirrors, probably the single most inflexible set ever designed for a production of Hamlet. As director, Branagh uses every trick in the book to hold our presumably flagging attentions: pointlessly swirling camera movements, equally pointless flashbacks and insets (Priam and Hecuba?), playing Patrick Doyle's oppressive score almost constantly over the dialogue. As actor, his performance is trivial when it isn't grating. Deficient in physical presence, intellectual heft and emotional complexity, he races through his lines till their sense becomes garbled and sometimes resorts to a screaming mode for which he hasn't the voice. In brief, he plays Hamlet as an ordinary young man who's gotten in a little over his head, which is a poor description of Hamlet but a spot-on description of Branagh.

    This is without a doubt the worst Shakespeare adaptation I've ever seen. That includes Baz Luhrmann's nauseating "Romeo + Juliet." I wasn't really sure what to expect going in-- no expectations whatsoever. Except that it would be a full-text adaptation of the play, something so unusual it was surrounded by a good deal of pomp and praise upon the film's initial release. Surely it was a brave thing to do, but was it in the best interests of the story? Absolutely not. In reality, "Hamlet" was probably never performed in its entirety even in Shakespeare's day. I was never a big fan of Branagh, but he did a reasonably good job with "Much Ado About Nothing," both directing and starring. Sadly it's the only halfway decent thing he's ever done. His "Hamlet" is most foul. It takes a great actor and a great director to be able to police oneself well enough to take on both roles in one of the most famous stories of all time. Branagh fails miserably. The film is largely constructed on two gimmicks-- the first being the percentage of text used (100%, obviously) and the second being its jarring update from medieval to 19th-century Denmark. The first gimmick mortally wounds the film right off the bat. Characters either pompously expound for minutes on end or shout with breakneck speed just to fit it all in. As for the second gimmick, it doesn't serve the story at all. It merely serves to distract us. After all, the primary reason to update the setting of a Shakespearean play is to make some kind of statement. It worked in "Titus," and, in theory, even worked in "Romeo + Juliet." But all it says here is, "I'm Kenneth Branagh and I can do whatever I want." The performances are so-so at best (Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet) and gut-wrenchingly awful on average (Branagh, Branagh, and more Branagh). It was nice to see Charlton Heston doing serious work again as the Player King, but crucial casting missteps were made virtually across the board, the worst being Robin Williams as Osric and Jack Lemmon as Marcellus. Indeed the film had almost as many irritatingly pointless "cameos" as "The Greatest Story Ever Told." Say what you will about Mel Gibson. But his performance as Hamlet, mediocre though it was, is leaps and bounds over Branagh's because Gibson had an amazing director, Franco Zeffirelli. Branagh merely thought his own director was great. His ridiculous arrogance bleeds through every frame. No movie in history has ever been so difficult to sit through, so gimmicky, so over-produced *and* so self-indulgent. Siskel and Ebert was right-- it does show Branagh's virtuosity. His virtuosity at making horrible decisions because he wanted to. The Bard would be disappointed to say the least.

    This 1996 film, directed and adapted by Kenneth Branagh, is Hamlet re-imagined as a 1960s epic: 4 hours long (complete with intermission), shot in 70mm widescreen and featuring star names in small roles. But whereas the 60s epics always looked to exotic climates, this remains anglo-centric in filling its panavision lens - shot at Shepperton Studios with some exteriors at Blenheim Place in Oxfordshire. Production designer Tim Harvey creates an Elsinore which is a huge and brightly lit 19th century palace with a central hall surrounded by mirrored doors and a chessboard floor. This isn't the usual darkly lit medieval castle of previous versions. The unabridged 4 hour text means this is often a very talkative film, but is also gives greater weight to supporting characters and Claudius's role is considerable larger than in either the 1948 or 1990 versions. And yet the film never feels over-long. Branagh is fine as Hamlet, supported by an excellent cast of English actors including Julie Christie as Gertrude, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, Derek Jacobi as Claudius and Richard Briers as Polonius. Jacobi is outstanding, speaking every line with crystal clarity. But what will attract most people to the movie is the all-star supporting cast in minor roles: Jack Lemmon as a guard, Billy Crystal as the grave digger, Charlton Heston as the Player King, as well as Gerard Depardieu, Robin Williams and Judi Dench. There's even John Gielgud and Ken Dodd in non-speaking roles. A remarkable achievement and amongst the finest Shakespearian adaptations ever committed to film.

    Kenneth Branaugh's 'Hamlet' is the first film version of Shakepeare's play to have been filmed with all of the content put back in. At 234 minutes it is never boring but shows the work of a director in love with this classic play. What we get from this longer version (the first in which not a single line has been trimmed) is that the characters motives become that much clearer. Studying Hamlet in school I had a hard time understanding how Hamlet's girl Ophelia went mad. Here the motivation is not only clearer but we see her in the process of her madness. We get from this version a wonderful performance by Kenneth Branaugh as the young prince who gets a visit from his father's ghost to inform him that it was his uncle that murdered him and now occupies the throne and the bed chamber of Hamlet's mother. But how to accuse the king of murder without making everyone think that you've gone completely mad? Most of the versions of this play have trimmed the fat and only given us the bare bones. This film is able to explain a few things and more, to help me understand motivations the play's message of mortality. I have never been able to understand how Claudius was able to convince sister-in-law Gertrude to marry him so soon after the king's death. Derek Jacobi brings such charm to the role that it's not only clear how he charmed he new wife but how he masterminded his brother's death as well. Much to our surprise and dismay, we sort of begin to understand why he did it. Key pieces of dialogue have been restored that flesh out the characters even more. Branaugh knows that the dialogue is key to the characters but also understands that the atmosphere of the castle plays a key role as well. The production design by Tim Harvey and Desmond Crowe are breathtaking suggesting a court of infinite secrets, not just a medieval castle of horrors. The opening scenes at the wedding of Claudius and Gertrude is a sight to behold with a hall that seems to stretch back and back and back into infinity. The throne room with it's wall of mirrors, some of which are passageways, leads to one of the most original scenes Â– Hamlet's To be or Not to be soliloquy spoken to a mirror with people hiding behind it. Is he talking to them or his own reflection? Are his questions in the reflection coming back at him? Then something else happens that I've never seen before in any version of Hamlet Â– a flashback of Yorich. During his scene in the graveyard he begins questioning the skull of the king's favorite buck-toothed clown. We flash back to the time when he played horsey with the young Hamlet. Then a close-up and a dissolve to the skull in Hamlet's hands with the buck-teeth still in it. The question of mortality remains but in Kenneth Branaugh's hands it hits home. Branaugh's performance as Hamlet is never morbid or redundant. He lashes out, overplays and uses wild gestures as he masterminds a plan to bring his uncle's guilt to the surface without making everyone think that the prince himself has gone off his rocker. This is key because making Hamlet into a pitiful slump distracts from what he does later in the play. He wonders about the matters of life and death, both physical and spiritual but Branaugh does it with curiosity not misery. I have never been so entertained by a filmed version of Shakespeare. Branaugh throws away the stogy, stagy elements that turn many people off of Shakespeare. But he really brings this film to life, not just the words but the actions. This is a man completely in love with this masterful play, he knows it we sense and I for one am grateful to have witnessed it.

    As far as Branagh's Shakespeare film adaptations go, this is one of the better ones. I personally preferred Much Ado About Nothing(1993), but Hamlet is one fine film. My only gripes are some of the cameos. Charlton Heston is good, but while it was nice to see Jack Lemmon he was too old I agree and Billy Crystal and Robin Williams come across as too modern and silly. Michael Maloney is okay but doesn't quite work appearance wise. Gripes aside, visually it is very striking. The settings are gorgeous, the costumes are equally exquisite and the cinematography is very skillful. The music score is a score of haunting, rousing and melancholic beauty, and enhances the film so well. The dialogue is still wonderful, and the story still has its emotional punch. The cast do a great job together. Kenneth Branagh directs with real vigour and does a fine job as Hamlet. Julie Christie is very good as Gertrude, Richard Briers is a good Polonious and Kate Winslet is a beautiful and poignant Orphelia. As the scheming villainous Claudius though, Derek Jacobi comes off best, his performance is brilliant. In conclusion, a fine adaptation and one of Branagh's better overall films. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    Keeping this brief, but I remember this version so fondly....and am a huge fan of actor/director/screenplay adapter Branagh. I am prompted to write because I haven't seen this one lately but yesterday saw Tony Richardson's Hamlet starring Nicol Williamson. How it made me appreciate THIS ONE. It is SO much better. There's almost no comparison. Branagh's Hamlet has more shades of color and complexity, more depth. He's the right age, and his mother and stepfather actually look older than he, which is not the case in the Hamlet with Williamson. Horatio is the right age to be his pal in Branagh's version-- is that too much to ask, a Horatio that does not look quite a bit older than Claudius? The play is not cut to ribbons, either, which is what we find in the Nicol Williamson version of Hamlet. In fact, it's the whole play, what a concept. Anyway I have not seen Branagh's Hamlet recently enough to give it a serious review, I only want to say that watching the truncated, miscast one from director Tony Richardson made me appreciate just how great this version is, how much it affected me when I saw it.

    The devil is in the details for Shakespeare. While the words are important, reading between the lines often gives the greatest fulfillment. Someone tell Kenneth Branagh. As a direct and unabridged reading, this Hamlet holds every word to sacrosanct, so it is ultimately the superior PRODUCTION of Hamlet we've yet seen. Or at least a noble attempt, though even this "full" text is disputed as definitive. As a movie, however, I cannot rate this as anything other than a failure for a very simple reason. Why? It isn't the massive sets, or large format photography. But they don't quite save Hamlet either. One could always point to good old English "irony" or "juxtaposition" in such a bright and jolly looking adaptation of what is a dark story of a hallucinating and suicidal boy struggling with the betrayals of his step-father, or perhaps the mother? But for me, it does not hold. Lavish, yes, appropriate? ehÂ… It isn't the cast, but some choices may leave you scratching Yorick. Robin Williams, Heston and Billy Crystal? While they seemingly were picked up for novelty and not drama, they aren't what bring down this movie either. There are some heavyweights in here, but the movie is notably missing the riveting ghost of Paul Scofield and Ian Holm's layered Polonius from the pop Franco Zeffirelli job. There's really no interpretation at all. A clear sign the movie was not actually directed but simply read aloud. No, what dooms this production of Hamlet for me isn't the 70mm photography, trendy casting, Ben Hur visuals or boomy music. What sinks Hamlet is the actor playing the lead character. Kenneth Branagh plays this part so removed from sympathy and his delivery is so grating, I actually wanted to poison him myself from the first moment he appeared on screen. From his Peter Pan appearance to skippy mannerisms, I could only see this Dane on the label of a peanut butter jar with a ear to ear grin. Hamlet is crazy, but he needs to be at least a little sympathetic to the audience. I could only root for the villain. For the very first time, it was quite sad to see Jakobi's Claudius go at the end. Branagh clearly knows all the words, but he's just a mime. This isn't Hamlet, it's Kenneth Branagh for four hours.

    This was long. 4 hours of uncondensed Shakespeare and I must say I enjoyed it. Kenneth Branagh is perhaps the Laurence Oliver of our times. A great actor obsessed with the work of Shakespeare. And this is his masterpiece, Hamlet (1996), a free uncondensed version with every line of what Shakespeare has written, on the last movie ,besides The Master, filmed on 70mm film. If you've graduated high school, you probably know the story of Hamlet. Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his father, who request the he kills his uncle, the new king of Denmark, because he murdered Hamlet's father. What I love about this adaptation is the things Kenneth Branagh does because he's using the medium of film. The use of Flashbacks in events is a great use that the stage adaptations could never do, same with the scenery. Elsinore Castle comes alive. It was genius for him to set the story in the 19th century. It gives a beautiful touch to the movie and costumes and set design were appropriate. THe final thing he does great is how he plays Hamlet. My English teacher taught him more as a mopey Dane, but he plays him as a cunning but indecisive genius which I believe is more interesting. His soliloquies have great touch to them, using visual elements and artful expression to make them interesting instead if Rambling. The cast is great too. No weak link in the acting, and everyone holds their own. The guest appearances of famous actors, Charlton Heston, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal add moments of freshness to secondary characters. The Cinematography shows off the world well and fits most scenes, same with the music. The problem is the length. It drags in places and with trimming could've been a masterful movie. Overall great adaptation (better than the Mel Gibson one) and shows off to a new generation the beauty and power of something written 400 years ago. If you have the time, check it out. 8/10

    Branagh's version of "Hamlet" is clearly the most successful screen adaptation of this immortal classic. While I can't absolutely compare Branagh's acting skills to the brilliant acting technique of Sir Laurence Olivier in his acclaimed version of Hamlet, it is clear that he managed to bring the wit,the critic to his society,the striking reflections on life and death,the projected madness and ultimately the melancholia of Prince Hamlet. Nevertheless Kenneth Branagh is the second best Hamlet ever seen in a film and he plays all the emotions attributed to Hamlet.Furthermore, his direction is visionary and original in every-way. The supporting cast is what made "Hamlet" unique compared to the previous adaptation. Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet are unattainable. Each of them gives the exact nature of their characters and plays their role with complete identification, expressing all the feelings and thoughts hidden in their troubled souls.The other actors in their minor roles play equally effectively. The set is visually striking and the music adds a sense of enormous tragedy.

    Kenneth Branaugh deserves a lot of credit for taking risks in his adaptation of Hamlet. He chooses to present the text uncut, something that pretty much nobody does, but which realizes aspects of the text that are usually ignored, like the geopolitical threat that the characters ignore to their peril. (It also includes a lot of overblown navel-gazing that is usually justly excised.) Far from the dark and gloomy atmosphere we usually see Hamlet presented in, Branaugh fills the screen of light, suggesting the former glory of the now debased court. While all this is interesting, there are a lot of problems with this adaptation. Branaugh is a bit too old and definitely too hammy to take seriously as Hamlet, and the ridiculous goatee he sports throughout the film doesn't help. The other actors come off better -- Derek Jacobi has a particularly good turn as Claudius -- but there's still a pervading odour of cheese, and the great drama of Hamlet frequently tips over into melodrama. Despite the bold choices he makes, Branaugh is ultimately using the aesthetics of a Hollywood blockbuster, and they're as shallow as ever. It's hard for an adaptation of Hamlet to be really bad, especially one as faithful as this: the iconic characters and the forceful plot are enough to carry even the limpest adaptation to something fairly decent. Still, the whole thing feels like a failed experiment, and you could probably see a better take on Hamlet at a local theatre show. So while Branaugh's ambitions deserve respect, he doesn't really have the chops to pull them off, no matter how many famous actors he pulls in.

Julie Christie is very good as Gertrude, Richard Briers is a good Polonious and Kate Winslet is a beautiful and poignant Orphelia. As the scheming villainous Claudius though, Derek Jacobi comes off best, his performance is brilliant. In conclusion, a fine adaptation and one of Branagh's better overall films. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    Keeping this brief, but I remember this version so fondly....and am a huge fan of actor/director/screenplay adapter Branagh. I am prompted to write because I haven't seen this one lately but yesterday saw Tony Richardson's Hamlet starring Nicol Williamson. How it made me appreciate THIS ONE. It is SO much better. There's almost no comparison. Branagh's Hamlet has more shades of color and complexity, more depth. He's the right age, and his mother and stepfather actually look older than he, which is not the case in the Hamlet with Williamson. Horatio is the right age to be his pal in Branagh's version-- is that too much to ask, a Horatio that does not look quite a bit older than Claudius? The play is not cut to ribbons, either, which is what we find in the Nicol Williamson version of Hamlet. In fact, it's the whole play, what a concept. Anyway I have not seen Branagh's Hamlet recently enough to give it a serious review, I only want to say that watching the truncated, miscast one from director Tony Richardson made me appreciate just how great this version is, how much it affected me when I saw it.

    The devil is in the details for Shakespeare. While the words are important, reading between the lines often gives the greatest fulfillment. Someone tell Kenneth Branagh. As a direct and unabridged reading, this Hamlet holds every word to sacrosanct, so it is ultimately the superior PRODUCTION of Hamlet we've yet seen. Or at least a noble attempt, though even this "full" text is disputed as definitive. As a movie, however, I cannot rate this as anything other than a failure for a very simple reason. Why? It isn't the massive sets, or large format photography. But they don't quite save Hamlet either. One could always point to good old English "irony" or "juxtaposition" in such a bright and jolly looking adaptation of what is a dark story of a hallucinating and suicidal boy struggling with the betrayals of his step-father, or perhaps the mother? But for me, it does not hold. Lavish, yes, appropriate? ehÂ… It isn't the cast, but some choices may leave you scratching Yorick. Robin Williams, Heston and Billy Crystal? While they seemingly were picked up for novelty and not drama, they aren't what bring down this movie either. There are some heavyweights in here, but the movie is notably missing the riveting ghost of Paul Scofield and Ian Holm's layered Polonius from the pop Franco Zeffirelli job. There's really no interpretation at all. A clear sign the movie was not actually directed but simply read aloud. No, what dooms this production of Hamlet for me isn't the 70mm photography, trendy casting, Ben Hur visuals or boomy music. What sinks Hamlet is the actor playing the lead character. Kenneth Branagh plays this part so removed from sympathy and his delivery is so grating, I actually wanted to poison him myself from the first moment he appeared on screen. From his Peter Pan appearance to skippy mannerisms, I could only see this Dane on the label of a peanut butter jar with a ear to ear grin. Hamlet is crazy, but he needs to be at least a little sympathetic to the audience. I could only root for the villain. For the very first time, it was quite sad to see Jakobi's Claudius go at the end. Branagh clearly knows all the words, but he's just a mime. This isn't Hamlet, it's Kenneth Branagh for four hours.

    This was long. 4 hours of uncondensed Shakespeare and I must say I enjoyed it. Kenneth Branagh is perhaps the Laurence Oliver of our times. A great actor obsessed with the work of Shakespeare. And this is his masterpiece, Hamlet (1996), a free uncondensed version with every line of what Shakespeare has written, on the last movie ,besides The Master, filmed on 70mm film. If you've graduated high school, you probably know the story of Hamlet. Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his father, who request the he kills his uncle, the new king of Denmark, because he murdered Hamlet's father. What I love about this adaptation is the things Kenneth Branagh does because he's using the medium of film. The use of Flashbacks in events is a great use that the stage adaptations could never do, same with the scenery. Elsinore Castle comes alive. It was genius for him to set the story in the 19th century. It gives a beautiful touch to the movie and costumes and set design were appropriate. THe final thing he does great is how he plays Hamlet. My English teacher taught him more as a mopey Dane, but he plays him as a cunning but indecisive genius which I believe is more interesting. His soliloquies have great touch to them, using visual elements and artful expression to make them interesting instead if Rambling. The cast is great too. No weak link in the acting, and everyone holds their own. The guest appearances of famous actors, Charlton Heston, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal add moments of freshness to secondary characters. The Cinematography shows off the world well and fits most scenes, same with the music. The problem is the length. It drags in places and with trimming could've been a masterful movie. Overall great adaptation (better than the Mel Gibson one) and shows off to a new generation the beauty and power of something written 400 years ago. If you have the time, check it out. 8/10

    Branagh's version of "Hamlet" is clearly the most successful screen adaptation of this immortal classic. While I can't absolutely compare Branagh's acting skills to the brilliant acting technique of Sir Laurence Olivier in his acclaimed version of Hamlet, it is clear that he managed to bring the wit,the critic to his society,the striking reflections on life and death,the projected madness and ultimately the melancholia of Prince Hamlet. Nevertheless Kenneth Branagh is the second best Hamlet ever seen in a film and he plays all the emotions attributed to Hamlet.Furthermore, his direction is visionary and original in every-way. The supporting cast is what made "Hamlet" unique compared to the previous adaptation. Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet are unattainable. Each of them gives the exact nature of their characters and plays their role with complete identification, expressing all the feelings and thoughts hidden in their troubled souls.The other actors in their minor roles play equally effectively. The set is visually striking and the music adds a sense of enormous tragedy.

    Kenneth Branaugh deserves a lot of credit for taking risks in his adaptation of Hamlet. He chooses to present the text uncut, something that pretty much nobody does, but which realizes aspects of the text that are usually ignored, like the geopolitical threat that the characters ignore to their peril. (It also includes a lot of overblown navel-gazing that is usually justly excised.) Far from the dark and gloomy atmosphere we usually see Hamlet presented in, Branaugh fills the screen of light, suggesting the former glory of the now debased court. While all this is interesting, there are a lot of problems with this adaptation. Branaugh is a bit too old and definitely too hammy to take seriously as Hamlet, and the ridiculous goatee he sports throughout the film doesn't help. The other actors come off better -- Derek Jacobi has a particularly good turn as Claudius -- but there's still a pervading odour of cheese, and the great drama of Hamlet frequently tips over into melodrama. Despite the bold choices he makes, Branaugh is ultimately using the aesthetics of a Hollywood blockbuster, and they're as shallow as ever. It's hard for an adaptation of Hamlet to be really bad, especially one as faithful as this: the iconic characters and the forceful plot are enough to carry even the limpest adaptation to something fairly decent. Still, the whole thing feels like a failed experiment, and you could probably see a better take on Hamlet at a local theatre show. So while Branaugh's ambitions deserve respect, he doesn't really have the chops to pull them off, no matter how many famous actors he pulls in.

    Sad to say, this is a very bad Hamlet and a very bad film: badly-directed, badly-designed, badly-shot, badly-staged, and worst of all badly-acted. Branagh is a ranting child, Derek Jacobi effete and spinsterish, Horatio a pill, Laertes an unsightly runt, Charlton Heston inappropriately granitic (the First Player is supposed to be an emotive actor, remember?), Polonius neither funny nor formidable, Jack Lemmon an embarrassment, Billy Crystal ditto, Kate Winslet all gush and baby-fat, Julie Christie merely decorative, etc., etc. The obvious under-budgeting doesn't help: the sets are tacky (that graveyard!), the process shots appalling, and much of the action is confined to a Hall of Mirrors, probably the single most inflexible set ever designed for a production of Hamlet. As director, Branagh uses every trick in the book to hold our presumably flagging attentions: pointlessly swirling camera movements, equally pointless flashbacks and insets (Priam and Hecuba?), playing Patrick Doyle's oppressive score almost constantly over the dialogue. As actor, his performance is trivial when it isn't grating. Deficient in physical presence, intellectual heft and emotional complexity, he races through his lines till their sense becomes garbled and sometimes resorts to a screaming mode for which he hasn't the voice. In brief, he plays Hamlet as an ordinary young man who's gotten in a little over his head, which is a poor description of Hamlet but a spot-on description of Branagh.

    This is without a doubt the worst Shakespeare adaptation I've ever seen. That includes Baz Luhrmann's nauseating "Romeo + Juliet." I wasn't really sure what to expect going in-- no expectations whatsoever. Except that it would be a full-text adaptation of the play, something so unusual it was surrounded by a good deal of pomp and praise upon the film's initial release. Surely it was a brave thing to do, but was it in the best interests of the story? Absolutely not. In reality, "Hamlet" was probably never performed in its entirety even in Shakespeare's day. I was never a big fan of Branagh, but he did a reasonably good job with "Much Ado About Nothing," both directing and starring. Sadly it's the only halfway decent thing he's ever done. His "Hamlet" is most foul. It takes a great actor and a great director to be able to police oneself well enough to take on both roles in one of the most famous stories of all time. Branagh fails miserably. The film is largely constructed on two gimmicks-- the first being the percentage of text used (100%, obviously) and the second being its jarring update from medieval to 19th-century Denmark. The first gimmick mortally wounds the film right off the bat. Characters either pompously expound for minutes on end or shout with breakneck speed just to fit it all in. As for the second gimmick, it doesn't serve the story at all. It merely serves to distract us. After all, the primary reason to update the setting of a Shakespearean play is to make some kind of statement. It worked in "Titus," and, in theory, even worked in "Romeo + Juliet." But all it says here is, "I'm Kenneth Branagh and I can do whatever I want." The performances are so-so at best (Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet) and gut-wrenchingly awful on average (Branagh, Branagh, and more Branagh). It was nice to see Charlton Heston doing serious work again as the Player King, but crucial casting missteps were made virtually across the board, the worst being Robin Williams as Osric and Jack Lemmon as Marcellus. Indeed the film had almost as many irritatingly pointless "cameos" as "The Greatest Story Ever Told." Say what you will about Mel Gibson. But his performance as Hamlet, mediocre though it was, is leaps and bounds over Branagh's because Gibson had an amazing director, Franco Zeffirelli. Branagh merely thought his own director was great. His ridiculous arrogance bleeds through every frame. No movie in history has ever been so difficult to sit through, so gimmicky, so over-produced *and* so self-indulgent. Siskel and Ebert was right-- it does show Branagh's virtuosity. His virtuosity at making horrible decisions because he wanted to. The Bard would be disappointed to say the least.

    This 1996 film, directed and adapted by Kenneth Branagh, is Hamlet re-imagined as a 1960s epic: 4 hours long (complete with intermission), shot in 70mm widescreen and featuring star names in small roles. But whereas the 60s epics always looked to exotic climates, this remains anglo-centric in filling its panavision lens - shot at Shepperton Studios with some exteriors at Blenheim Place in Oxfordshire. Production designer Tim Harvey creates an Elsinore which is a huge and brightly lit 19th century palace with a central hall surrounded by mirrored doors and a chessboard floor. This isn't the usual darkly lit medieval castle of previous versions. The unabridged 4 hour text means this is often a very talkative film, but is also gives greater weight to supporting characters and Claudius's role is considerable larger than in either the 1948 or 1990 versions. And yet the film never feels over-long. Branagh is fine as Hamlet, supported by an excellent cast of English actors including Julie Christie as Gertrude, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, Derek Jacobi as Claudius and Richard Briers as Polonius. Jacobi is outstanding, speaking every line with crystal clarity. But what will attract most people to the movie is the all-star supporting cast in minor roles: Jack Lemmon as a guard, Billy Crystal as the grave digger, Charlton Heston as the Player King, as well as Gerard Depardieu, Robin Williams and Judi Dench. There's even John Gielgud and Ken Dodd in non-speaking roles. A remarkable achievement and amongst the finest Shakespearian adaptations ever committed to film.

    Kenneth Branaugh's 'Hamlet' is the first film version of Shakepeare's play to have been filmed with all of the content put back in. At 234 minutes it is never boring but shows the work of a director in love with this classic play. What we get from this longer version (the first in which not a single line has been trimmed) is that the characters motives become that much clearer. Studying Hamlet in school I had a hard time understanding how Hamlet's girl Ophelia went mad. Here the motivation is not only clearer but we see her in the process of her madness. We get from this version a wonderful performance by Kenneth Branaugh as the young prince who gets a visit from his father's ghost to inform him that it was his uncle that murdered him and now occupies the throne and the bed chamber of Hamlet's mother. But how to accuse the king of murder without making everyone think that you've gone completely mad? Most of the versions of this play have trimmed the fat and only given us the bare bones. This film is able to explain a few things and more, to help me understand motivations the play's message of mortality. I have never been able to understand how Claudius was able to convince sister-in-law Gertrude to marry him so soon after the king's death. Derek Jacobi brings such charm to the role that it's not only clear how he charmed he new wife but how he masterminded his brother's death as well. Much to our surprise and dismay, we sort of begin to understand why he did it. Key pieces of dialogue have been restored that flesh out the characters even more. Branaugh knows that the dialogue is key to the characters but also understands that the atmosphere of the castle plays a key role as well. The production design by Tim Harvey and Desmond Crowe are breathtaking suggesting a court of infinite secrets, not just a medieval castle of horrors. The opening scenes at the wedding of Claudius and Gertrude is a sight to behold with a hall that seems to stretch back and back and back into infinity. The throne room with it's wall of mirrors, some of which are passageways, leads to one of the most original scenes Â– Hamlet's To be or Not to be soliloquy spoken to a mirror with people hiding behind it. Is he talking to them or his own reflection? Are his questions in the reflection coming back at him? Then something else happens that I've never seen before in any version of Hamlet Â– a flashback of Yorich. During his scene in the graveyard he begins questioning the skull of the king's favorite buck-toothed clown. We flash back to the time when he played horsey with the young Hamlet. Then a close-up and a dissolve to the skull in Hamlet's hands with the buck-teeth still in it. The question of mortality remains but in Kenneth Branaugh's hands it hits home. Branaugh's performance as Hamlet is never morbid or redundant. He lashes out, overplays and uses wild gestures as he masterminds a plan to bring his uncle's guilt to the surface without making everyone think that the prince himself has gone off his rocker. This is key because making Hamlet into a pitiful slump distracts from what he does later in the play. He wonders about the matters of life and death, both physical and spiritual but Branaugh does it with curiosity not misery. I have never been so entertained by a filmed version of Shakespeare. Branaugh throws away the stogy, stagy elements that turn many people off of Shakespeare. But he really brings this film to life, not just the words but the actions. This is a man completely in love with this masterful play, he knows it we sense and I for one am grateful to have witnessed it.

    As far as Branagh's Shakespeare film adaptations go, this is one of the better ones. I personally preferred Much Ado About Nothing(1993), but Hamlet is one fine film. My only gripes are some of the cameos. Charlton Heston is good, but while it was nice to see Jack Lemmon he was too old I agree and Billy Crystal and Robin Williams come across as too modern and silly. Michael Maloney is okay but doesn't quite work appearance wise. Gripes aside, visually it is very striking. The settings are gorgeous, the costumes are equally exquisite and the cinematography is very skillful. The music score is a score of haunting, rousing and melancholic beauty, and enhances the film so well. The dialogue is still wonderful, and the story still has its emotional punch. The cast do a great job together. Kenneth Branagh directs with real vigour and does a fine job as Hamlet. Julie Christie is very good as Gertrude, Richard Briers is a good Polonious and Kate Winslet is a beautiful and poignant Orphelia. As the scheming villainous Claudius though, Derek Jacobi comes off best, his performance is brilliant. In conclusion, a fine adaptation and one of Branagh's better overall films. 9/10 Bethany Cox

Deficient in physical presence, intellectual heft and emotional complexity, he races through his lines till their sense becomes garbled and sometimes resorts to a screaming mode for which he hasn't the voice. In brief, he plays Hamlet as an ordinary young man who's gotten in a little over his head, which is a poor description of Hamlet but a spot-on description of Branagh.

    This is without a doubt the worst Shakespeare adaptation I've ever seen. That includes Baz Luhrmann's nauseating "Romeo + Juliet." I wasn't really sure what to expect going in-- no expectations whatsoever. Except that it would be a full-text adaptation of the play, something so unusual it was surrounded by a good deal of pomp and praise upon the film's initial release. Surely it was a brave thing to do, but was it in the best interests of the story? Absolutely not. In reality, "Hamlet" was probably never performed in its entirety even in Shakespeare's day. I was never a big fan of Branagh, but he did a reasonably good job with "Much Ado About Nothing," both directing and starring. Sadly it's the only halfway decent thing he's ever done. His "Hamlet" is most foul. It takes a great actor and a great director to be able to police oneself well enough to take on both roles in one of the most famous stories of all time. Branagh fails miserably. The film is largely constructed on two gimmicks-- the first being the percentage of text used (100%, obviously) and the second being its jarring update from medieval to 19th-century Denmark. The first gimmick mortally wounds the film right off the bat. Characters either pompously expound for minutes on end or shout with breakneck speed just to fit it all in. As for the second gimmick, it doesn't serve the story at all. It merely serves to distract us. After all, the primary reason to update the setting of a Shakespearean play is to make some kind of statement. It worked in "Titus," and, in theory, even worked in "Romeo + Juliet." But all it says here is, "I'm Kenneth Branagh and I can do whatever I want." The performances are so-so at best (Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet) and gut-wrenchingly awful on average (Branagh, Branagh, and more Branagh). It was nice to see Charlton Heston doing serious work again as the Player King, but crucial casting missteps were made virtually across the board, the worst being Robin Williams as Osric and Jack Lemmon as Marcellus. Indeed the film had almost as many irritatingly pointless "cameos" as "The Greatest Story Ever Told." Say what you will about Mel Gibson. But his performance as Hamlet, mediocre though it was, is leaps and bounds over Branagh's because Gibson had an amazing director, Franco Zeffirelli. Branagh merely thought his own director was great. His ridiculous arrogance bleeds through every frame. No movie in history has ever been so difficult to sit through, so gimmicky, so over-produced *and* so self-indulgent. Siskel and Ebert was right-- it does show Branagh's virtuosity. His virtuosity at making horrible decisions because he wanted to. The Bard would be disappointed to say the least.

    This 1996 film, directed and adapted by Kenneth Branagh, is Hamlet re-imagined as a 1960s epic: 4 hours long (complete with intermission), shot in 70mm widescreen and featuring star names in small roles. But whereas the 60s epics always looked to exotic climates, this remains anglo-centric in filling its panavision lens - shot at Shepperton Studios with some exteriors at Blenheim Place in Oxfordshire. Production designer Tim Harvey creates an Elsinore which is a huge and brightly lit 19th century palace with a central hall surrounded by mirrored doors and a chessboard floor. This isn't the usual darkly lit medieval castle of previous versions. The unabridged 4 hour text means this is often a very talkative film, but is also gives greater weight to supporting characters and Claudius's role is considerable larger than in either the 1948 or 1990 versions. And yet the film never feels over-long. Branagh is fine as Hamlet, supported by an excellent cast of English actors including Julie Christie as Gertrude, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, Derek Jacobi as Claudius and Richard Briers as Polonius. Jacobi is outstanding, speaking every line with crystal clarity. But what will attract most people to the movie is the all-star supporting cast in minor roles: Jack Lemmon as a guard, Billy Crystal as the grave digger, Charlton Heston as the Player King, as well as Gerard Depardieu, Robin Williams and Judi Dench. There's even John Gielgud and Ken Dodd in non-speaking roles. A remarkable achievement and amongst the finest Shakespearian adaptations ever committed to film.

    Kenneth Branaugh's 'Hamlet' is the first film version of Shakepeare's play to have been filmed with all of the content put back in. At 234 minutes it is never boring but shows the work of a director in love with this classic play. What we get from this longer version (the first in which not a single line has been trimmed) is that the characters motives become that much clearer. Studying Hamlet in school I had a hard time understanding how Hamlet's girl Ophelia went mad. Here the motivation is not only clearer but we see her in the process of her madness. We get from this version a wonderful performance by Kenneth Branaugh as the young prince who gets a visit from his father's ghost to inform him that it was his uncle that murdered him and now occupies the throne and the bed chamber of Hamlet's mother. But how to accuse the king of murder without making everyone think that you've gone completely mad? Most of the versions of this play have trimmed the fat and only given us the bare bones. This film is able to explain a few things and more, to help me understand motivations the play's message of mortality. I have never been able to understand how Claudius was able to convince sister-in-law Gertrude to marry him so soon after the king's death. Derek Jacobi brings such charm to the role that it's not only clear how he charmed he new wife but how he masterminded his brother's death as well. Much to our surprise and dismay, we sort of begin to understand why he did it. Key pieces of dialogue have been restored that flesh out the characters even more. Branaugh knows that the dialogue is key to the characters but also understands that the atmosphere of the castle plays a key role as well. The production design by Tim Harvey and Desmond Crowe are breathtaking suggesting a court of infinite secrets, not just a medieval castle of horrors. The opening scenes at the wedding of Claudius and Gertrude is a sight to behold with a hall that seems to stretch back and back and back into infinity. The throne room with it's wall of mirrors, some of which are passageways, leads to one of the most original scenes Â– Hamlet's To be or Not to be soliloquy spoken to a mirror with people hiding behind it. Is he talking to them or his own reflection? Are his questions in the reflection coming back at him? Then something else happens that I've never seen before in any version of Hamlet Â– a flashback of Yorich. During his scene in the graveyard he begins questioning the skull of the king's favorite buck-toothed clown. We flash back to the time when he played horsey with the young Hamlet. Then a close-up and a dissolve to the skull in Hamlet's hands with the buck-teeth still in it. The question of mortality remains but in Kenneth Branaugh's hands it hits home. Branaugh's performance as Hamlet is never morbid or redundant. He lashes out, overplays and uses wild gestures as he masterminds a plan to bring his uncle's guilt to the surface without making everyone think that the prince himself has gone off his rocker. This is key because making Hamlet into a pitiful slump distracts from what he does later in the play. He wonders about the matters of life and death, both physical and spiritual but Branaugh does it with curiosity not misery. I have never been so entertained by a filmed version of Shakespeare. Branaugh throws away the stogy, stagy elements that turn many people off of Shakespeare. But he really brings this film to life, not just the words but the actions. This is a man completely in love with this masterful play, he knows it we sense and I for one am grateful to have witnessed it.

    As far as Branagh's Shakespeare film adaptations go, this is one of the better ones. I personally preferred Much Ado About Nothing(1993), but Hamlet is one fine film. My only gripes are some of the cameos. Charlton Heston is good, but while it was nice to see Jack Lemmon he was too old I agree and Billy Crystal and Robin Williams come across as too modern and silly. Michael Maloney is okay but doesn't quite work appearance wise. Gripes aside, visually it is very striking. The settings are gorgeous, the costumes are equally exquisite and the cinematography is very skillful. The music score is a score of haunting, rousing and melancholic beauty, and enhances the film so well. The dialogue is still wonderful, and the story still has its emotional punch. The cast do a great job together. Kenneth Branagh directs with real vigour and does a fine job as Hamlet. Julie Christie is very good as Gertrude, Richard Briers is a good Polonious and Kate Winslet is a beautiful and poignant Orphelia. As the scheming villainous Claudius though, Derek Jacobi comes off best, his performance is brilliant. In conclusion, a fine adaptation and one of Branagh's better overall films. 9/10 Bethany Cox

    Keeping this brief, but I remember this version so fondly....and am a huge fan of actor/director/screenplay adapter Branagh. I am prompted to write because I haven't seen this one lately but yesterday saw Tony Richardson's Hamlet starring Nicol Williamson. How it made me appreciate THIS ONE. It is SO much better. There's almost no comparison. Branagh's Hamlet has more shades of color and complexity, more depth. He's the right age, and his mother and stepfather actually look older than he, which is not the case in the Hamlet with Williamson. Horatio is the right age to be his pal in Branagh's version-- is that too much to ask, a Horatio that does not look quite a bit older than Claudius? The play is not cut to ribbons, either, which is what we find in the Nicol Williamson version of Hamlet. In fact, it's the whole play, what a concept. Anyway I have not seen Branagh's Hamlet recently enough to give it a serious review, I only want to say that watching the truncated, miscast one from director Tony Richardson made me appreciate just how great this version is, how much it affected me when I saw it.

    The devil is in the details for Shakespeare. While the words are important, reading between the lines often gives the greatest fulfillment. Someone tell Kenneth Branagh. As a direct and unabridged reading, this Hamlet holds every word to sacrosanct, so it is ultimately the superior PRODUCTION of Hamlet we've yet seen. Or at least a noble attempt, though even this "full" text is disputed as definitive. As a movie, however, I cannot rate this as anything other than a failure for a very simple reason. Why? It isn't the massive sets, or large format photography. But they don't quite save Hamlet either. One could always point to good old English "irony" or "juxtaposition" in such a bright and jolly looking adaptation of what is a dark story of a hallucinating and suicidal boy struggling with the betrayals of his step-father, or perhaps the mother? But for me, it does not hold. Lavish, yes, appropriate? ehÂ… It isn't the cast, but some choices may leave you scratching Yorick. Robin Williams, Heston and Billy Crystal? While they seemingly were picked up for novelty and not drama, they aren't what bring down this movie either. There are some heavyweights in here, but the movie is notably missing the riveting ghost of Paul Scofield and Ian Holm's layered Polonius from the pop Franco Zeffirelli job. There's really no interpretation at all. A clear sign the movie was not actually directed but simply read aloud. No, what dooms this production of Hamlet for me isn't the 70mm photography, trendy casting, Ben Hur visuals or boomy music. What sinks Hamlet is the actor playing the lead character. Kenneth Branagh plays this part so removed from sympathy and his delivery is so grating, I actually wanted to poison him myself from the first moment he appeared on screen. From his Peter Pan appearance to skippy mannerisms, I could only see this Dane on the label of a peanut butter jar with a ear to ear grin. Hamlet is crazy, but he needs to be at least a little sympathetic to the audience. I could only root for the villain. For the very first time, it was quite sad to see Jakobi's Claudius go at the end. Branagh clearly knows all the words, but he's just a mime. This isn't Hamlet, it's Kenneth Branagh for four hours.

    This was long. 4 hours of uncondensed Shakespeare and I must say I enjoyed it. Kenneth Branagh is perhaps the Laurence Oliver of our times. A great actor obsessed with the work of Shakespeare. And this is his masterpiece, Hamlet (1996), a free uncondensed version with every line of what Shakespeare has written, on the last movie ,besides The Master, filmed on 70mm film. If you've graduated high school, you probably know the story of Hamlet. Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his father, who request the he kills his uncle, the new king of Denmark, because he murdered Hamlet's father. What I love about this adaptation is the things Kenneth Branagh does because he's using the medium of film. The use of Flashbacks in events is a great use that the stage adaptations could never do, same with the scenery. Elsinore Castle comes alive. It was genius for him to set the story in the 19th century. It gives a beautiful touch to the movie and costumes and set design were appropriate. THe final thing he does great is how he plays Hamlet. My English teacher taught him more as a mopey Dane, but he plays him as a cunning but indecisive genius which I believe is more interesting. His soliloquies have great touch to them, using visual elements and artful expression to make them interesting instead if Rambling. The cast is great too. No weak link in the acting, and everyone holds their own. The guest appearances of famous actors, Charlton Heston, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal add moments of freshness to secondary characters. The Cinematography shows off the world well and fits most scenes, same with the music. The problem is the length. It drags in places and with trimming could've been a masterful movie. Overall great adaptation (better than the Mel Gibson one) and shows off to a new generation the beauty and power of something written 400 years ago. If you have the time, check it out. 8/10

    Branagh's version of "Hamlet" is clearly the most successful screen adaptation of this immortal classic. While I can't absolutely compare Branagh's acting skills to the brilliant acting technique of Sir Laurence Olivier in his acclaimed version of Hamlet, it is clear that he managed to bring the wit,the critic to his society,the striking reflections on life and death,the projected madness and ultimately the melancholia of Prince Hamlet. Nevertheless Kenneth Branagh is the second best Hamlet ever seen in a film and he plays all the emotions attributed to Hamlet.Furthermore, his direction is visionary and original in every-way. The supporting cast is what made "Hamlet" unique compared to the previous adaptation. Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet are unattainable. Each of them gives the exact nature of their characters and plays their role with complete identification, expressing all the feelings and thoughts hidden in their troubled souls.The other actors in their minor roles play equally effectively. The set is visually striking and the music adds a sense of enormous tragedy.

    Kenneth Branaugh deserves a lot of credit for taking risks in his adaptation of Hamlet. He chooses to present the text uncut, something that pretty much nobody does, but which realizes aspects of the text that are usually ignored, like the geopolitical threat that the characters ignore to their peril. (It also includes a lot of overblown navel-gazing that is usually justly excised.) Far from the dark and gloomy atmosphere we usually see Hamlet presented in, Branaugh fills the screen of light, suggesting the former glory of the now debased court. While all this is interesting, there are a lot of problems with this adaptation. Branaugh is a bit too old and definitely too hammy to take seriously as Hamlet, and the ridiculous goatee he sports throughout the film doesn't help. The other actors come off better -- Derek Jacobi has a particularly good turn as Claudius -- but there's still a pervading odour of cheese, and the great drama of Hamlet frequently tips over into melodrama. Despite the bold choices he makes, Branaugh is ultimately using the aesthetics of a Hollywood blockbuster, and they're as shallow as ever. It's hard for an adaptation of Hamlet to be really bad, especially one as faithful as this: the iconic characters and the forceful plot are enough to carry even the limpest adaptation to something fairly decent. Still, the whole thing feels like a failed experiment, and you could probably see a better take on Hamlet at a local theatre show. So while Branaugh's ambitions deserve respect, he doesn't really have the chops to pull them off, no matter how many famous actors he pulls in.

    Sad to say, this is a very bad Hamlet and a very bad film: badly-directed, badly-designed, badly-shot, badly-staged, and worst of all badly-acted. Branagh is a ranting child, Derek Jacobi effete and spinsterish, Horatio a pill, Laertes an unsightly runt, Charlton Heston inappropriately granitic (the First Player is supposed to be an emotive actor, remember?), Polonius neither funny nor formidable, Jack Lemmon an embarrassment, Billy Crystal ditto, Kate Winslet all gush and baby-fat, Julie Christie merely decorative, etc., etc. The obvious under-budgeting doesn't help: the sets are tacky (that graveyard!), the process shots appalling, and much of the action is confined to a Hall of Mirrors, probably the single most inflexible set ever designed for a production of Hamlet. As director, Branagh uses every trick in the book to hold our presumably flagging attentions: pointlessly swirling camera movements, equally pointless flashbacks and insets (Priam and Hecuba?), playing Patrick Doyle's oppressive score almost constantly over the dialogue. As actor, his performance is trivial when it isn't grating. Deficient in physical presence, intellectual heft and emotional complexity, he races through his lines till their sense becomes garbled and sometimes resorts to a screaming mode for which he hasn't the voice. In brief, he plays Hamlet as an ordinary young man who's gotten in a little over his head, which is a poor description of Hamlet but a spot-on description of Branagh.

I am prompted to write because I haven't seen this one lately but yesterday saw Tony Richardson's Hamlet starring Nicol Williamson. How it made me appreciate THIS ONE. It is SO much better. There's almost no comparison. Branagh's Hamlet has more shades of color and complexity, more depth. He's the right age, and his mother and stepfather actually look older than he, which is not the case in the Hamlet with Williamson. Horatio is the right age to be his pal in Branagh's version-- is that too much to ask, a Horatio that does not look quite a bit older than Claudius? The play is not cut to ribbons, either, which is what we find in the Nicol Williamson version of Hamlet. In fact, it's the whole play, what a concept. Anyway I have not seen Branagh's Hamlet recently enough to give it a serious review, I only want to say that watching the truncated, miscast one from director Tony Richardson made me appreciate just how great this version is, how much it affected me when I saw it.

    The devil is in the details for Shakespeare. While the words are important, reading between the lines often gives the greatest fulfillment. Someone tell Kenneth Branagh. As a direct and unabridged reading, this Hamlet holds every word to sacrosanct, so it is ultimately the superior PRODUCTION of Hamlet we've yet seen. Or at least a noble attempt, though even this "full" text is disputed as definitive. As a movie, however, I cannot rate this as anything other than a failure for a very simple reason. Why? It isn't the massive sets, or large format photography. But they don't quite save Hamlet either. One could always point to good old English "irony" or "juxtaposition" in such a bright and jolly looking adaptation of what is a dark story of a hallucinating and suicidal boy struggling with the betrayals of his step-father, or perhaps the mother? But for me, it does not hold. Lavish, yes, appropriate? ehÂ… It isn't the cast, but some choices may leave you scratching Yorick. Robin Williams, Heston and Billy Crystal? While they seemingly were picked up for novelty and not drama, they aren't what bring down this movie either. There are some heavyweights in here, but the movie is notably missing the riveting ghost of Paul Scofield and Ian Holm's layered Polonius from the pop Franco Zeffirelli job. There's really no interpretation at all. A clear sign the movie was not actually directed but simply read aloud. No, what dooms this production of Hamlet for me isn't the 70mm photography, trendy casting, Ben Hur visuals or boomy music. What sinks Hamlet is the actor playing the lead character. Kenneth Branagh plays this part so removed from sympathy and his delivery is so grating, I actually wanted to poison him myself from the first moment he appeared on screen. From his Peter Pan appearance to skippy mannerisms, I could only see this Dane on the label of a peanut butter jar with a ear to ear grin. Hamlet is crazy, but he needs to be at least a little sympathetic to the audience. I could only root for the villain. For the very first time, it was quite sad to see Jakobi's Claudius go at the end. Branagh clearly knows all the words, but he's just a mime. This isn't Hamlet, it's Kenneth Branagh for four hours.

    This was long. 4 hours of uncondensed Shakespeare and I must say I enjoyed it. Kenneth Branagh is perhaps the Laurence Oliver of our times. A great actor obsessed with the work of Shakespeare. And this is his masterpiece, Hamlet (1996), a free uncondensed version with every line of what Shakespeare has written, on the last movie ,besides The Master, filmed on 70mm film. If you've graduated high school, you probably know the story of Hamlet. Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his father, who request the he kills his uncle, the new king of Denmark, because he murdered Hamlet's father. What I love about this adaptation is the things Kenneth Branagh does because he's using the medium of film. The use of Flashbacks in events is a great use that the stage adaptations could never do, same with the scenery. Elsinore Castle comes alive. It was genius for him to set the story in the 19th century. It gives a beautiful touch to the movie and costumes and set design were appropriate. THe final thing he does great is how he plays Hamlet. My English teacher taught him more as a mopey Dane, but he plays him as a cunning but indecisive genius which I believe is more interesting. His soliloquies have great touch to them, using visual elements and artful expression to make them interesting instead if Rambling. The cast is great too. No weak link in the acting, and everyone holds their own. The guest appearances of famous actors, Charlton Heston, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal add moments of freshness to secondary characters. The Cinematography shows off the world well and fits most scenes, same with the music. The problem is the length. It drags in places and with trimming could've been a masterful movie. Overall great adaptation (better than the Mel Gibson one) and shows off to a new generation the beauty and power of something written 400 years ago. If you have the time, check it out. 8/10

    Branagh's version of "Hamlet" is clearly the most successful screen adaptation of this immortal classic. While I can't absolutely compare Branagh's acting skills to the brilliant acting technique of Sir Laurence Olivier in his acclaimed version of Hamlet, it is clear that he managed to bring the wit,the critic to his society,the striking reflections on life and death,the projected madness and ultimately the melancholia of Prince Hamlet. Nevertheless Kenneth Branagh is the second best Hamlet ever seen in a film and he plays all the emotions attributed to Hamlet.Furthermore, his direction is visionary and original in every-way. The supporting cast is what made "Hamlet" unique compared to the previous adaptation. Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet are unattainable. Each of them gives the exact nature of their characters and plays their role with complete identification, expressing all the feelings and thoughts hidden in their troubled souls.The other actors in their minor roles play equally effectively. The set is visually striking and the music adds a sense of enormous tragedy.

    Kenneth Branaugh deserves a lot of credit for taking risks in his adaptation of Hamlet. He chooses to present the text uncut, something that pretty much nobody does, but which realizes aspects of the text that are usually ignored, like the geopolitical threat that the characters ignore to their peril. (It also includes a lot of overblown navel-gazing that is usually justly excised.) Far from the dark and gloomy atmosphere we usually see Hamlet presented in, Branaugh fills the screen of light, suggesting the former glory of the now debased court. While all this is interesting, there are a lot of problems with this adaptation. Branaugh is a bit too old and definitely too hammy to take seriously as Hamlet, and the ridiculous goatee he sports throughout the film doesn't help. The other actors come off better -- Derek Jacobi has a particularly good turn as Claudius -- but there's still a pervading odour of cheese, and the great drama of Hamlet frequently tips over into melodrama. Despite the bold choices he makes, Branaugh is ultimately using the aesthetics of a Hollywood blockbuster, and they're as shallow as ever. It's hard for an adaptation of Hamlet to be really bad, especially one as faithful as this: the iconic characters and the forceful plot are enough to carry even the limpest adaptation to something fairly decent. Still, the whole thing feels like a failed experiment, and you could probably see a better take on Hamlet at a local theatre show. So while Branaugh's ambitions deserve respect, he doesn't really have the chops to pull them off, no matter how many famous actors he pulls in.

    Sad to say, this is a very bad Hamlet and a very bad film: badly-directed, badly-designed, badly-shot, badly-staged, and worst of all badly-acted. Branagh is a ranting child, Derek Jacobi effete and spinsterish, Horatio a pill, Laertes an unsightly runt, Charlton Heston inappropriately granitic (the First Player is supposed to be an emotive actor, remember?), Polonius neither funny nor formidable, Jack Lemmon an embarrassment, Billy Crystal ditto, Kate Winslet all gush and baby-fat, Julie Christie merely decorative, etc., etc. The obvious under-budgeting doesn't help: the sets are tacky (that graveyard!), the process shots appalling, and much of the action is confined to a Hall of Mirrors, probably the single most inflexible set ever designed for a production of Hamlet. As director, Branagh uses every trick in the book to hold our presumably flagging attentions: pointlessly swirling camera movements, equally pointless flashbacks and insets (Priam and Hecuba?), playing Patrick Doyle's oppressive score almost constantly over the dialogue. As actor, his performance is trivial when it isn't grating. Deficient in physical presence, intellectual heft and emotional complexity, he races through his lines till their sense becomes garbled and sometimes resorts to a screaming mode for which he hasn't the voice. In brief, he plays Hamlet as an ordinary young man who's gotten in a little over his head, which is a poor description of Hamlet but a spot-on description of Branagh.

    This is without a doubt the worst Shakespeare adaptation I've ever seen. That includes Baz Luhrmann's nauseating "Romeo + Juliet." I wasn't really sure what to expect going in-- no expectations whatsoever. Except that it would be a full-text adaptation of the play, something so unusual it was surrounded by a good deal of pomp and praise upon the film's initial release. Surely it was a brave thing to do, but was it in the best interests of the story? Absolutely not. In reality, "Hamlet" was probably never performed in its entirety even in Shakespeare's day. I was never a big fan of Branagh, but he did a reasonably good job with "Much Ado About Nothing," both directing and starring. Sadly it's the only halfway decent thing he's ever done. His "Hamlet" is most foul. It takes a great actor and a great director to be able to police oneself well enough to take on both roles in one of the most famous stories of all time. Branagh fails miserably. The film is largely constructed on two gimmicks-- the first being the percentage of text used (100%, obviously) and the second being its jarring update from medieval to 19th-century Denmark. The first gimmick mortally wounds the film right off the bat. Characters either pompously expound for minutes on end or shout with breakneck speed just to fit it all in. As for the second gimmick, it doesn't serve the story at all. It merely serves to distract us. After all, the primary reason to update the setting of a Shakespearean play is to make some kind of statement. It worked in "Titus," and, in theory, even worked in "Romeo + Juliet." But all it says here is, "I'm Kenneth Branagh and I can do whatever I want." The performances are so-so at best (Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet) and gut-wrenchingly awful on average (Branagh, Branagh, and more Branagh). It was nice to see Charlton Heston doing serious work again as the Player King, but crucial casting missteps were made virtually across the board, the worst being Robin Williams as Osric and Jack Lemmon as Marcellus. Indeed the film had almost as many irritatingly pointless "cameos" as "The Greatest Story Ever Told." Say what you will about Mel Gibson. But his performance as Hamlet, mediocre though it was, is leaps and bounds over Branagh's because Gibson had an amazing director, Franco Zeffirelli. Branagh merely thought his own director was great. His ridiculous arrogance bleeds through every frame. No movie in history has ever been so difficult to sit through, so gimmicky, so over-produced *and* so self-indulgent. Siskel and Ebert was right-- it does show Branagh's virtuosity. His virtuosity at making horrible decisions because he wanted to. The Bard would be disappointed to say the least.

    This 1996 film, directed and adapted by Kenneth Branagh, is Hamlet re-imagined as a 1960s epic: 4 hours long (complete with intermission), shot in 70mm widescreen and featuring star names in small roles. But whereas the 60s epics always looked to exotic climates, this remains anglo-centric in filling its panavision lens - shot at Shepperton Studios with some exteriors at Blenheim Place in Oxfordshire. Production designer Tim Harvey creates an Elsinore which is a huge and brightly lit 19th century palace with a central hall surrounded by mirrored doors and a chessboard floor. This isn't the usual darkly lit medieval castle of previous versions. The unabridged 4 hour text means this is often a very talkative film, but is also gives greater weight to supporting characters and Claudius's role is considerable larger than in either the 1948 or 1990 versions. And yet the film never feels over-long. Branagh is fine as Hamlet, supported by an excellent cast of English actors including Julie Christie as Gertrude, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, Derek Jacobi as Claudius and Richard Briers as Polonius. Jacobi is outstanding, speaking every line with crystal clarity. But what will attract most people to the movie is the all-star supporting cast in minor roles: Jack Lemmon as a guard, Billy Crystal as the grave digger, Charlton Heston as the Player King, as well as Gerard Depardieu, Robin Williams and Judi Dench. There's even John Gielgud and Ken Dodd in non-speaking roles. A remarkable achievement and amongst the finest Shakespearian adaptations ever committed to film.

    Kenneth Branaugh's 'Hamlet' is the first film version of Shakepeare's play to have been filmed with all of the content put back in. At 234 minutes it is never boring but shows the work of a director in love with this classic play. What we get from this longer version (the first in which not a single line has been trimmed) is that the characters motives become that much clearer. Studying Hamlet in school I had a hard time understanding how Hamlet's girl Ophelia went mad. Here the motivation is not only clearer but we see her in the process of her madness. We get from this version a wonderful performance by Kenneth Branaugh as the young prince who gets a visit from his father's ghost to inform him that it was his uncle that murdered him and now occupies the throne and the bed chamber of Hamlet's mother. But how to accuse the king of murder without making everyone think that you've gone completely mad? Most of the versions of this play have trimmed the fat and only given us the bare bones. This film is able to explain a few things and more, to help me understand motivations the play's message of mortality. I have never been able to understand how Claudius was able to convince sister-in-law Gertrude to marry him so soon after the king's death. Derek Jacobi brings such charm to the role that it's not only clear how he charmed he new wife but how he masterminded his brother's death as well. Much to our surprise and dismay, we sort of begin to understand why he did it. Key pieces of dialogue have been restored that flesh out the characters even more. Branaugh knows that the dialogue is key to the characters but also understands that the atmosphere of the castle plays a key role as well. The production design by Tim Harvey and Desmond Crowe are breathtaking suggesting a court of infinite secrets, not just a medieval castle of horrors. The opening scenes at the wedding of Claudius and Gertrude is a sight to behold with a hall that seems to stretch back and back and back into infinity. The throne room with it's wall of mirrors, some of which are passageways, leads to one of the most original scenes Â– Hamlet's To be or Not to be soliloquy spoken to a mirror with people hiding behind it. Is he talking to them or his own reflection? Are his questions in the reflection coming back at him? Then something else happens that I've never seen before in any version of Hamlet Â– a flashback of Yorich. During his scene in the graveyard he begins questioning the skull of the king's favorite buck-toothed clown. We flash back to the time when he played horsey with the young Hamlet. Then a close-up and a dissolve to the skull in Hamlet's hands with the buck-teeth still in it. The question of mortality remains but in Kenneth Branaugh's hands it hits home. Branaugh's performance as Hamlet is never morbid or redundant. He lashes out, overplays and uses wild gestures as he masterminds a plan to bring his uncle's guilt to the surface without making everyone think that the prince himself has gone off his rocker. This is key because making Hamlet into a pitiful slump distracts from what he does later in the play. He wonders about the matters of life and death, both physical and spiritual but Branaugh does it with curiosity not misery. I have never been so entertained by a filmed version of Shakespeare. Branaugh throws away the stogy, stagy elements that turn many people off of Shakespeare. But he really brings this film to life, not just the words but the actions. This is a man completely in love with this masterful play, he knows it we sense and I for one am grateful to have witnessed it.

    As far as Branagh's Shakespeare film adaptations go, this is one of the better ones. I personally preferred Much Ado About Nothing(1993), but Hamlet is one fine film. My only gripes are some of the cameos. Charlton Heston is good, but while it was nice to see Jack Lemmon he was too old I agree and Billy Crystal and Robin Williams come across as too modern and silly. Michael Maloney is okay but doesn't quite work appearance wise. Gripes aside, visually it is very striking. The settings are gorgeous, the costumes are equally exquisite and the cinematography is very skillful. The music score is a score of haunting, rousing and melancholic beauty, and enhances the film so well. The dialogue is still wonderful, and the story still has its emotional punch. The cast do a great job together. Kenneth Branagh directs with real vigour and does a fine job as Hamlet. Julie Christie is very good as Gertrude, Richard Briers is a good Polonious and Kate Winslet is a beautiful and poignant Orphelia. As the scheming villainous Claudius though, Derek Jacobi comes off best, his performance is brilliant. In conclusion, a fine adaptation and one of Branagh's better overall films. 9/10 Bethany Cox
