    "Mitt Liv Som Hund" or simply "My Life as a Dog" is a warming and poetic chronicle of the life of a young boy who learns about what growing up is like when faced to live with another parents after his mother's illness prevents her from taking care of him and his older brother. The boy, Ingemar (the gifted Anton Glanzelius), narrates his distant happy memories while living with his mother and then later his future discoveries and events that changed his life. While telling his stories he keeps comparing his life to the Laika's life, the little dog who was sent to space by the Soviet in 1957, year the movie's story starts. "But one must compare", he says. And the comparison he makes with the dog is a reflexive one which seems totally unrelated with the movie but it's not. It's about the process of growing up, facing the unknown (or little known). Laika in the space, Ingemar on the ground with his eccentric uncles, new friends and far away from the very few people he knew: his sick mother and his brother, sent to another home. One has to be afraid of the unknown, to question it again and again but always compare. Maybe later one will know that aren't hard as it appear to be. It carries the same childhood innocence presented in Truffaut's "L'argent De Poche" which presented several sketches of kids getting involved in pranks, apparently harmless sometimes, other times involving great danger, but always discovering, learning something. It had its great dramatic moments but most of it was a collection of nostalgic and jolly images which brings back one of the most fundamental part of our lives: our childhood. What do we do those moments? Well, we compare it to our experiences (if you remember them) and observe if it was that difficult to break from one phase to another, and if we had strange and bitter days or wonderful and pleasant moments. We have to compare, you have to compare! Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m makes of this a glorious, beautiful and funny picture, one to be viewed multiple times not because it's difficult or peculiar but because of its graceful and delicacy, truly reward and temptive. Not only those, he extracted one of the greatest performances by a child actor. Glanzelius is natural, convincing and a true to joy to be seen acting. His Ingemar might have a strange optic of things, a puzzling behavior and a puzzling mannerism (the thing he does with the milk to quote an example) but there's plenty of admirable things to which any of us can relate to him. It's a shame he practically vanished from the movie business after giving one helluva of performance. The golden ticket that brought the director to Hollwyood after his Oscar nomination, this is Hallstr&ouml;m's best film to date. Not saying that "Chocolate" and "The Cider House Rules" don't have merits cause they have but gotta admit that Hollywood ruined a bit Mr. Hallstr&ouml;m's potential with all the awarded and nominated tearjerkers he made there, most of them flicks that go for the easy tears and easy targets. He's so much more effective with simple presentations, which mirrors life and are relevant to life, going deeper than anything. In "My Life as a Dog" he goes for the smiles and the positive emotions with glimpses of sadness. Sweet as childhood. But that's just my perspective. 10/10

    Ingemar is on the cusp of adolescence. It is the late 1950s Sweden. When the opening scene showed Ingemar on the beach amusing his mother with some childish antics, I was primed for a happy coming-of-age story. But then it is revealed that Ingemar is living at home with his mother who has tuberculosis. This sets the theme of the movie, just when you think things might be looking up for Ingemar, darker issues arise. Anton Glanzelius, who plays Ingemar, embodies a perfect combination of imp and winsomeness. He can cause adults grief with his trouble-making, but much of the time it is his innocence that gets him into trouble, like the time he has a small fire going in a trash dump that gets out of control, or the time he is suckered into an embarrassing prank at school. He has some odd behaviors, like approaching his milk glass with trepidation as if were one of life's great challenges to drink from it. When Ingemar becomes too much for his mother to handle he is sent to a small village down south to live with his uncle's family. This village has more than its share of eccentrics, like an older guy who is constantly repairing his roof, or the uncle's father who asks Ingemar to read to him from the lingerie section of a catalog. Much of the footage at the uncle's is gentle humor interspersed with typical trials of growing up. But then the mother dies. And so it goes. Ingemar has a delightful philosophical bent. As one way to deal with life's challenges he frequently tries to comfort himself by thinking that things could be worse. He keeps meditating on Laika, the dog that the Soviets sent into space in 1957, the first living animal sent up. In thinking of Laika, Ingemar comments, "You have to compare, so you can keep perspective. It helps to keep a little distance." He frets over the thought that Laika was sent into space knowing that he would most certainly starve to death. Maybe Ingemar sensed a wider metaphorical meaning--in some sense we are all shot into space at birth only ultimately to suffer the fate of certain death. The main musical theme perfectly captures the melancholic mood; its memory is one of the things that drew me to re-watch this after having first seen it over twenty years ago.

    At the end of the movie one finds out who was the dog whose life is being told. It isn't Laika sent in space at the onset of the movie, but the little boy who identifies with his dog who was put to sleep while he was away at his uncle's place. The little boys is from a modest background, grows up like the rest of the town, and faces problems many faced in those years. In his case his mom was sick and his dad was never home (had he ever been home?). At the uncle's place the boy slowly discovers other facets of the world, never losing his grace. Not much of a plot really. When I first heard about it, I thought this movie was going to suck big times, but my girlfriend of the time insisted to go see it. She was right. It isn't the plot, but the events, the pace, the closeness to real life, the innocence of the early years, ... all these things add up to an amazing experience of almost going again through childhood. I am giving it a 9 because, theoretically, there could be better movies out there, although it's gonna be tough to beat this one.

    I had high expectations for My Life as a Dog, and not only did the film meet those expectations it also surpassed them. I was really taken with the emotional core My Life as a Dog had. The scenes where Ingemar gets into mischief are fitfully amusing, but other scenes are very poignant too. I think some of the emotional resonance of the film comes from how truthful and warm My Life as a Dog is, there's even something very Truffautesque about it. My Life as a Dog has an evocative script, a compelling story and characters that feel real, you immediately connect with Ingemar and do so right up to the last second. Lasse Hallstrom directs beautifully, the film looks gorgeous in photography and production values, the score is haunting and Anton Glanzelius's lead performance is astonishing combining charm and wit with innocence and spirit. Overall, a truly wonderful movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    I thought this was a strange movie. It has so many good critiques that I expected something better. It was good at times, but aside that it was downright dull and with mostly unlikeable characters. Despite being a drama, it isn't as involving and deep as a drama should be. I'd like to sympathize more with the lead character, Ingemar, but I can't always do that. He is hard to evaluate: he isn't annoying, but he ain't sweet peer either. He often seemed like a retard due to his sometimes erratic behavior (such as barking like a dog). Still, he is wonderfully portrayed by the actor Anton Glanzelius. Saga, the tomboy, was another complicated character. She is supposed to like Ingemar, and yet she shows her love for him in a strange manner: by beating him up in a boxing match and hugging him during or after that. She is well played by Melinda Kinnaman. This film makes reference to Laika's story a cup of times. Despite his problems, Ingemar often seeks solace by reciting the tragic story of Laika the space dog. That is one good thing about this film, bringing some poetry and some soul to it. The Swedish film-making and cinematography is another solid point, thanks to the natural beauty of the sunny settings and the characteristic snow and freezy nordic weather. There have been complains about child nudity. What is it with everybody and this paranoia over pedophilia? Just because of one scene of child nudity in a film they already think it's pedophilia. It's scary how people got paranoid.

    This is one of the most touching, challenging, downright delightful movies I've seen. It is a portrayal of the coming of age of a young trouble maker whose life is in disrepair. His mother has been victimized by disease and she has this incorrigible little boy whom she loves but can't control. He is suffering from no love and seeks it out where he can. He is the paragon of attention deficit disorder. The movie isn't morose, however. He is genuinely funny and loving when he has the chance to be. He is sent to live with relatives where his life opens up and he begins to have purpose. He is given some latitude and begins to develop a real life. Unfortunately, there are events going on around him that will impact him, including the continuing deterioration of his mother's health and the little dog he left behind. He has so little power in his life as is the case with most little boys, and at times he tries to hard. One delightful connection is a young girl who is a better athlete than the boys in the town. There is this sexual tension that takes place as she matures and begins to fall for him. It is happy and sad and has a lovely message about grasping life whenever we can. See this.

    A mischievous young boy with a Puckish smile, unusual table manners, and a sympathetic kinship to Laika the Soviet astro-dog is sent by his ailing mother to live with relatives in the country, where he discovers a town full of people even more eccentric than himself. Director Lasse Hallstrom's popular Swedish import offers a refreshing look at the mysteries and heartbreak of adolescence, with all the charm but none of the cloying sentiment of other, similar coming-of-age films. The rich humor is drawn around an affectionate portrait of small town life, closely observed; the pain comes from the realization that young Ingmar's bedridden mother has already passed away. The pace is often lazy and the film is overlong, but Hallstrom's understanding of human idiosyncrasies is reminiscent of a Jacques Tati comedy, choosing to laugh with instead of at his characters. It's a memorable look at love and mortality, as seen from the innocent eyes of a boy passing through that awkward age when he begins thinking like an adult while still unable to stop acting like a child.

    The film was nominated for, and won, several awards across the world, but the specter of Bergman still lingers over the film, even if oppositionally. The Swedes depicted on screen are nothing like those in the Bergman universe. They are not rich, depressed, and well educated. Ingemar and his brother and mother live in a shanty house slum, and his uncle's country place is only a little nicer, even if the scenery is much more wholesome. And despite having far more reason to moan than Bergman's characters do, Ingemar is marked by a perseverance one can only refer to as 'dogged.' The cinematography by J&ouml;rgen Persson is solid, although there is a repeated static shot of the cosmos, whenever Ingemar gets reflective, that looks like something from a 1950s sci fi film where the word 'Science!' is spoken ecstatically, which should have been made to look a bit more engaging. Granted, this might be the typical textbook sort of photo that a child would associate with outer space in those days, but it still drags on the often deeper narration Ingemar provides, and simply looks cheap. While the film was based upon a novel with the same title, written by Reidar Jonsson, and the screenplay was written by Hallstr&ouml;m, Jonsson, and Brasse Brannstrom and Per Berglund, the character of Ingemar succeeds less on the words the character speaks, and mostly on the uncanny acting ability- or even inability, of Glanzelius- who never had another major starring role. There is just something 'off' about little Ingemar, something which, as reflected in the screenplay, is missing in comparison to Glanzelius's portrayal. The text would lead one to believe Ingemar is just another kid, if perhaps one a bit 'off,' yet Glanzelius's unaffected portrayal reveals him to be perhaps 'slow' or borderline 'autistic'- as he might now be labeled, especially when he goes on all fours and barks like a dog or cannot drink from a glass in public without spilling the liquid all over himself. Then there is the actor's very appearance, which has an odd, almost maniacal twinkle in his mien, akin to a young Jack Nicholson's. All in all, My Life As A Dog is a good non-Hollywood Hollywood film, albeit a deeper one, without forced emotions. It is a film that hints at a promise Hallstr&ouml;m has yet to fulfill, opening up the query over whether or not it is better to never fill potential by existence and failure or by not existing at all. Perhaps Ingemar already thought that through whilst pondering that dog high above his own canine plight?

    "My Life as a Dog" is a simple story about a 12 year old, mischievous boy, who is trying to find his way. He has a brother that he does not really get along with, a mother who is getting progressively sicker, and a dog who gives him the love that he is not able to get from either his mother or brother. To help his mother recover, he is sent packing, off to live for the summer with an uncle, where he finds a place to fit in, and friends and neighbors who are just as "strange" and mischievous. The film is a memory, neither romanticized or critical of either the boy or his family and friends. It simply tells the tale of a boy on the verge of puberty and the confusing feelings that he experiences. I didn't like the repetitive nature of the narration that occurs throughout the film, but I found myself drawn into the story and the characters. Lasse Hallstrom does a marvelous job of getting genuine, honest performances from all of his actors, who are all excellent. 8 out of 10

    This is nothing more than Swedish porn. And to make matters worse, it even qualifies in the category of child porn. Guess the Swedes enjoy that type of smut. This film should be shown in theaters that cater to that type of smut. I can think of two areas that would like to show it. They are Time Square in NYC and Harry Hines Blvd in Dallas, TX. The acting was very amateur and the characters never defined their personalities. All in all, I am grateful that I did not have to spend any money to view this tripe. Also, I noticed that the film itself was in poor shape with a lot of film gate damage.

There is this sexual tension that takes place as she matures and begins to fall for him. It is happy and sad and has a lovely message about grasping life whenever we can. See this.

    A mischievous young boy with a Puckish smile, unusual table manners, and a sympathetic kinship to Laika the Soviet astro-dog is sent by his ailing mother to live with relatives in the country, where he discovers a town full of people even more eccentric than himself. Director Lasse Hallstrom's popular Swedish import offers a refreshing look at the mysteries and heartbreak of adolescence, with all the charm but none of the cloying sentiment of other, similar coming-of-age films. The rich humor is drawn around an affectionate portrait of small town life, closely observed; the pain comes from the realization that young Ingmar's bedridden mother has already passed away. The pace is often lazy and the film is overlong, but Hallstrom's understanding of human idiosyncrasies is reminiscent of a Jacques Tati comedy, choosing to laugh with instead of at his characters. It's a memorable look at love and mortality, as seen from the innocent eyes of a boy passing through that awkward age when he begins thinking like an adult while still unable to stop acting like a child.

    The film was nominated for, and won, several awards across the world, but the specter of Bergman still lingers over the film, even if oppositionally. The Swedes depicted on screen are nothing like those in the Bergman universe. They are not rich, depressed, and well educated. Ingemar and his brother and mother live in a shanty house slum, and his uncle's country place is only a little nicer, even if the scenery is much more wholesome. And despite having far more reason to moan than Bergman's characters do, Ingemar is marked by a perseverance one can only refer to as 'dogged.' The cinematography by J&ouml;rgen Persson is solid, although there is a repeated static shot of the cosmos, whenever Ingemar gets reflective, that looks like something from a 1950s sci fi film where the word 'Science!' is spoken ecstatically, which should have been made to look a bit more engaging. Granted, this might be the typical textbook sort of photo that a child would associate with outer space in those days, but it still drags on the often deeper narration Ingemar provides, and simply looks cheap. While the film was based upon a novel with the same title, written by Reidar Jonsson, and the screenplay was written by Hallstr&ouml;m, Jonsson, and Brasse Brannstrom and Per Berglund, the character of Ingemar succeeds less on the words the character speaks, and mostly on the uncanny acting ability- or even inability, of Glanzelius- who never had another major starring role. There is just something 'off' about little Ingemar, something which, as reflected in the screenplay, is missing in comparison to Glanzelius's portrayal. The text would lead one to believe Ingemar is just another kid, if perhaps one a bit 'off,' yet Glanzelius's unaffected portrayal reveals him to be perhaps 'slow' or borderline 'autistic'- as he might now be labeled, especially when he goes on all fours and barks like a dog or cannot drink from a glass in public without spilling the liquid all over himself. Then there is the actor's very appearance, which has an odd, almost maniacal twinkle in his mien, akin to a young Jack Nicholson's. All in all, My Life As A Dog is a good non-Hollywood Hollywood film, albeit a deeper one, without forced emotions. It is a film that hints at a promise Hallstr&ouml;m has yet to fulfill, opening up the query over whether or not it is better to never fill potential by existence and failure or by not existing at all. Perhaps Ingemar already thought that through whilst pondering that dog high above his own canine plight?

    "My Life as a Dog" is a simple story about a 12 year old, mischievous boy, who is trying to find his way. He has a brother that he does not really get along with, a mother who is getting progressively sicker, and a dog who gives him the love that he is not able to get from either his mother or brother. To help his mother recover, he is sent packing, off to live for the summer with an uncle, where he finds a place to fit in, and friends and neighbors who are just as "strange" and mischievous. The film is a memory, neither romanticized or critical of either the boy or his family and friends. It simply tells the tale of a boy on the verge of puberty and the confusing feelings that he experiences. I didn't like the repetitive nature of the narration that occurs throughout the film, but I found myself drawn into the story and the characters. Lasse Hallstrom does a marvelous job of getting genuine, honest performances from all of his actors, who are all excellent. 8 out of 10

    This is nothing more than Swedish porn. And to make matters worse, it even qualifies in the category of child porn. Guess the Swedes enjoy that type of smut. This film should be shown in theaters that cater to that type of smut. I can think of two areas that would like to show it. They are Time Square in NYC and Harry Hines Blvd in Dallas, TX. The acting was very amateur and the characters never defined their personalities. All in all, I am grateful that I did not have to spend any money to view this tripe. Also, I noticed that the film itself was in poor shape with a lot of film gate damage.

    "Mitt Liv Som Hund" or simply "My Life as a Dog" is a warming and poetic chronicle of the life of a young boy who learns about what growing up is like when faced to live with another parents after his mother's illness prevents her from taking care of him and his older brother. The boy, Ingemar (the gifted Anton Glanzelius), narrates his distant happy memories while living with his mother and then later his future discoveries and events that changed his life. While telling his stories he keeps comparing his life to the Laika's life, the little dog who was sent to space by the Soviet in 1957, year the movie's story starts. "But one must compare", he says. And the comparison he makes with the dog is a reflexive one which seems totally unrelated with the movie but it's not. It's about the process of growing up, facing the unknown (or little known). Laika in the space, Ingemar on the ground with his eccentric uncles, new friends and far away from the very few people he knew: his sick mother and his brother, sent to another home. One has to be afraid of the unknown, to question it again and again but always compare. Maybe later one will know that aren't hard as it appear to be. It carries the same childhood innocence presented in Truffaut's "L'argent De Poche" which presented several sketches of kids getting involved in pranks, apparently harmless sometimes, other times involving great danger, but always discovering, learning something. It had its great dramatic moments but most of it was a collection of nostalgic and jolly images which brings back one of the most fundamental part of our lives: our childhood. What do we do those moments? Well, we compare it to our experiences (if you remember them) and observe if it was that difficult to break from one phase to another, and if we had strange and bitter days or wonderful and pleasant moments. We have to compare, you have to compare! Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m makes of this a glorious, beautiful and funny picture, one to be viewed multiple times not because it's difficult or peculiar but because of its graceful and delicacy, truly reward and temptive. Not only those, he extracted one of the greatest performances by a child actor. Glanzelius is natural, convincing and a true to joy to be seen acting. His Ingemar might have a strange optic of things, a puzzling behavior and a puzzling mannerism (the thing he does with the milk to quote an example) but there's plenty of admirable things to which any of us can relate to him. It's a shame he practically vanished from the movie business after giving one helluva of performance. The golden ticket that brought the director to Hollwyood after his Oscar nomination, this is Hallstr&ouml;m's best film to date. Not saying that "Chocolate" and "The Cider House Rules" don't have merits cause they have but gotta admit that Hollywood ruined a bit Mr. Hallstr&ouml;m's potential with all the awarded and nominated tearjerkers he made there, most of them flicks that go for the easy tears and easy targets. He's so much more effective with simple presentations, which mirrors life and are relevant to life, going deeper than anything. In "My Life as a Dog" he goes for the smiles and the positive emotions with glimpses of sadness. Sweet as childhood. But that's just my perspective. 10/10

    Ingemar is on the cusp of adolescence. It is the late 1950s Sweden. When the opening scene showed Ingemar on the beach amusing his mother with some childish antics, I was primed for a happy coming-of-age story. But then it is revealed that Ingemar is living at home with his mother who has tuberculosis. This sets the theme of the movie, just when you think things might be looking up for Ingemar, darker issues arise. Anton Glanzelius, who plays Ingemar, embodies a perfect combination of imp and winsomeness. He can cause adults grief with his trouble-making, but much of the time it is his innocence that gets him into trouble, like the time he has a small fire going in a trash dump that gets out of control, or the time he is suckered into an embarrassing prank at school. He has some odd behaviors, like approaching his milk glass with trepidation as if were one of life's great challenges to drink from it. When Ingemar becomes too much for his mother to handle he is sent to a small village down south to live with his uncle's family. This village has more than its share of eccentrics, like an older guy who is constantly repairing his roof, or the uncle's father who asks Ingemar to read to him from the lingerie section of a catalog. Much of the footage at the uncle's is gentle humor interspersed with typical trials of growing up. But then the mother dies. And so it goes. Ingemar has a delightful philosophical bent. As one way to deal with life's challenges he frequently tries to comfort himself by thinking that things could be worse. He keeps meditating on Laika, the dog that the Soviets sent into space in 1957, the first living animal sent up. In thinking of Laika, Ingemar comments, "You have to compare, so you can keep perspective. It helps to keep a little distance." He frets over the thought that Laika was sent into space knowing that he would most certainly starve to death. Maybe Ingemar sensed a wider metaphorical meaning--in some sense we are all shot into space at birth only ultimately to suffer the fate of certain death. The main musical theme perfectly captures the melancholic mood; its memory is one of the things that drew me to re-watch this after having first seen it over twenty years ago.

    At the end of the movie one finds out who was the dog whose life is being told. It isn't Laika sent in space at the onset of the movie, but the little boy who identifies with his dog who was put to sleep while he was away at his uncle's place. The little boys is from a modest background, grows up like the rest of the town, and faces problems many faced in those years. In his case his mom was sick and his dad was never home (had he ever been home?). At the uncle's place the boy slowly discovers other facets of the world, never losing his grace. Not much of a plot really. When I first heard about it, I thought this movie was going to suck big times, but my girlfriend of the time insisted to go see it. She was right. It isn't the plot, but the events, the pace, the closeness to real life, the innocence of the early years, ... all these things add up to an amazing experience of almost going again through childhood. I am giving it a 9 because, theoretically, there could be better movies out there, although it's gonna be tough to beat this one.

    I had high expectations for My Life as a Dog, and not only did the film meet those expectations it also surpassed them. I was really taken with the emotional core My Life as a Dog had. The scenes where Ingemar gets into mischief are fitfully amusing, but other scenes are very poignant too. I think some of the emotional resonance of the film comes from how truthful and warm My Life as a Dog is, there's even something very Truffautesque about it. My Life as a Dog has an evocative script, a compelling story and characters that feel real, you immediately connect with Ingemar and do so right up to the last second. Lasse Hallstrom directs beautifully, the film looks gorgeous in photography and production values, the score is haunting and Anton Glanzelius's lead performance is astonishing combining charm and wit with innocence and spirit. Overall, a truly wonderful movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    I thought this was a strange movie. It has so many good critiques that I expected something better. It was good at times, but aside that it was downright dull and with mostly unlikeable characters. Despite being a drama, it isn't as involving and deep as a drama should be. I'd like to sympathize more with the lead character, Ingemar, but I can't always do that. He is hard to evaluate: he isn't annoying, but he ain't sweet peer either. He often seemed like a retard due to his sometimes erratic behavior (such as barking like a dog). Still, he is wonderfully portrayed by the actor Anton Glanzelius. Saga, the tomboy, was another complicated character. She is supposed to like Ingemar, and yet she shows her love for him in a strange manner: by beating him up in a boxing match and hugging him during or after that. She is well played by Melinda Kinnaman. This film makes reference to Laika's story a cup of times. Despite his problems, Ingemar often seeks solace by reciting the tragic story of Laika the space dog. That is one good thing about this film, bringing some poetry and some soul to it. The Swedish film-making and cinematography is another solid point, thanks to the natural beauty of the sunny settings and the characteristic snow and freezy nordic weather. There have been complains about child nudity. What is it with everybody and this paranoia over pedophilia? Just because of one scene of child nudity in a film they already think it's pedophilia. It's scary how people got paranoid.

    This is one of the most touching, challenging, downright delightful movies I've seen. It is a portrayal of the coming of age of a young trouble maker whose life is in disrepair. His mother has been victimized by disease and she has this incorrigible little boy whom she loves but can't control. He is suffering from no love and seeks it out where he can. He is the paragon of attention deficit disorder. The movie isn't morose, however. He is genuinely funny and loving when he has the chance to be. He is sent to live with relatives where his life opens up and he begins to have purpose. He is given some latitude and begins to develop a real life. Unfortunately, there are events going on around him that will impact him, including the continuing deterioration of his mother's health and the little dog he left behind. He has so little power in his life as is the case with most little boys, and at times he tries to hard. One delightful connection is a young girl who is a better athlete than the boys in the town. There is this sexual tension that takes place as she matures and begins to fall for him. It is happy and sad and has a lovely message about grasping life whenever we can. See this.

It isn't the plot, but the events, the pace, the closeness to real life, the innocence of the early years, ... all these things add up to an amazing experience of almost going again through childhood. I am giving it a 9 because, theoretically, there could be better movies out there, although it's gonna be tough to beat this one.

    I had high expectations for My Life as a Dog, and not only did the film meet those expectations it also surpassed them. I was really taken with the emotional core My Life as a Dog had. The scenes where Ingemar gets into mischief are fitfully amusing, but other scenes are very poignant too. I think some of the emotional resonance of the film comes from how truthful and warm My Life as a Dog is, there's even something very Truffautesque about it. My Life as a Dog has an evocative script, a compelling story and characters that feel real, you immediately connect with Ingemar and do so right up to the last second. Lasse Hallstrom directs beautifully, the film looks gorgeous in photography and production values, the score is haunting and Anton Glanzelius's lead performance is astonishing combining charm and wit with innocence and spirit. Overall, a truly wonderful movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    I thought this was a strange movie. It has so many good critiques that I expected something better. It was good at times, but aside that it was downright dull and with mostly unlikeable characters. Despite being a drama, it isn't as involving and deep as a drama should be. I'd like to sympathize more with the lead character, Ingemar, but I can't always do that. He is hard to evaluate: he isn't annoying, but he ain't sweet peer either. He often seemed like a retard due to his sometimes erratic behavior (such as barking like a dog). Still, he is wonderfully portrayed by the actor Anton Glanzelius. Saga, the tomboy, was another complicated character. She is supposed to like Ingemar, and yet she shows her love for him in a strange manner: by beating him up in a boxing match and hugging him during or after that. She is well played by Melinda Kinnaman. This film makes reference to Laika's story a cup of times. Despite his problems, Ingemar often seeks solace by reciting the tragic story of Laika the space dog. That is one good thing about this film, bringing some poetry and some soul to it. The Swedish film-making and cinematography is another solid point, thanks to the natural beauty of the sunny settings and the characteristic snow and freezy nordic weather. There have been complains about child nudity. What is it with everybody and this paranoia over pedophilia? Just because of one scene of child nudity in a film they already think it's pedophilia. It's scary how people got paranoid.

    This is one of the most touching, challenging, downright delightful movies I've seen. It is a portrayal of the coming of age of a young trouble maker whose life is in disrepair. His mother has been victimized by disease and she has this incorrigible little boy whom she loves but can't control. He is suffering from no love and seeks it out where he can. He is the paragon of attention deficit disorder. The movie isn't morose, however. He is genuinely funny and loving when he has the chance to be. He is sent to live with relatives where his life opens up and he begins to have purpose. He is given some latitude and begins to develop a real life. Unfortunately, there are events going on around him that will impact him, including the continuing deterioration of his mother's health and the little dog he left behind. He has so little power in his life as is the case with most little boys, and at times he tries to hard. One delightful connection is a young girl who is a better athlete than the boys in the town. There is this sexual tension that takes place as she matures and begins to fall for him. It is happy and sad and has a lovely message about grasping life whenever we can. See this.

    A mischievous young boy with a Puckish smile, unusual table manners, and a sympathetic kinship to Laika the Soviet astro-dog is sent by his ailing mother to live with relatives in the country, where he discovers a town full of people even more eccentric than himself. Director Lasse Hallstrom's popular Swedish import offers a refreshing look at the mysteries and heartbreak of adolescence, with all the charm but none of the cloying sentiment of other, similar coming-of-age films. The rich humor is drawn around an affectionate portrait of small town life, closely observed; the pain comes from the realization that young Ingmar's bedridden mother has already passed away. The pace is often lazy and the film is overlong, but Hallstrom's understanding of human idiosyncrasies is reminiscent of a Jacques Tati comedy, choosing to laugh with instead of at his characters. It's a memorable look at love and mortality, as seen from the innocent eyes of a boy passing through that awkward age when he begins thinking like an adult while still unable to stop acting like a child.

    The film was nominated for, and won, several awards across the world, but the specter of Bergman still lingers over the film, even if oppositionally. The Swedes depicted on screen are nothing like those in the Bergman universe. They are not rich, depressed, and well educated. Ingemar and his brother and mother live in a shanty house slum, and his uncle's country place is only a little nicer, even if the scenery is much more wholesome. And despite having far more reason to moan than Bergman's characters do, Ingemar is marked by a perseverance one can only refer to as 'dogged.' The cinematography by J&ouml;rgen Persson is solid, although there is a repeated static shot of the cosmos, whenever Ingemar gets reflective, that looks like something from a 1950s sci fi film where the word 'Science!' is spoken ecstatically, which should have been made to look a bit more engaging. Granted, this might be the typical textbook sort of photo that a child would associate with outer space in those days, but it still drags on the often deeper narration Ingemar provides, and simply looks cheap. While the film was based upon a novel with the same title, written by Reidar Jonsson, and the screenplay was written by Hallstr&ouml;m, Jonsson, and Brasse Brannstrom and Per Berglund, the character of Ingemar succeeds less on the words the character speaks, and mostly on the uncanny acting ability- or even inability, of Glanzelius- who never had another major starring role. There is just something 'off' about little Ingemar, something which, as reflected in the screenplay, is missing in comparison to Glanzelius's portrayal. The text would lead one to believe Ingemar is just another kid, if perhaps one a bit 'off,' yet Glanzelius's unaffected portrayal reveals him to be perhaps 'slow' or borderline 'autistic'- as he might now be labeled, especially when he goes on all fours and barks like a dog or cannot drink from a glass in public without spilling the liquid all over himself. Then there is the actor's very appearance, which has an odd, almost maniacal twinkle in his mien, akin to a young Jack Nicholson's. All in all, My Life As A Dog is a good non-Hollywood Hollywood film, albeit a deeper one, without forced emotions. It is a film that hints at a promise Hallstr&ouml;m has yet to fulfill, opening up the query over whether or not it is better to never fill potential by existence and failure or by not existing at all. Perhaps Ingemar already thought that through whilst pondering that dog high above his own canine plight?

    "My Life as a Dog" is a simple story about a 12 year old, mischievous boy, who is trying to find his way. He has a brother that he does not really get along with, a mother who is getting progressively sicker, and a dog who gives him the love that he is not able to get from either his mother or brother. To help his mother recover, he is sent packing, off to live for the summer with an uncle, where he finds a place to fit in, and friends and neighbors who are just as "strange" and mischievous. The film is a memory, neither romanticized or critical of either the boy or his family and friends. It simply tells the tale of a boy on the verge of puberty and the confusing feelings that he experiences. I didn't like the repetitive nature of the narration that occurs throughout the film, but I found myself drawn into the story and the characters. Lasse Hallstrom does a marvelous job of getting genuine, honest performances from all of his actors, who are all excellent. 8 out of 10

    This is nothing more than Swedish porn. And to make matters worse, it even qualifies in the category of child porn. Guess the Swedes enjoy that type of smut. This film should be shown in theaters that cater to that type of smut. I can think of two areas that would like to show it. They are Time Square in NYC and Harry Hines Blvd in Dallas, TX. The acting was very amateur and the characters never defined their personalities. All in all, I am grateful that I did not have to spend any money to view this tripe. Also, I noticed that the film itself was in poor shape with a lot of film gate damage.

    "Mitt Liv Som Hund" or simply "My Life as a Dog" is a warming and poetic chronicle of the life of a young boy who learns about what growing up is like when faced to live with another parents after his mother's illness prevents her from taking care of him and his older brother. The boy, Ingemar (the gifted Anton Glanzelius), narrates his distant happy memories while living with his mother and then later his future discoveries and events that changed his life. While telling his stories he keeps comparing his life to the Laika's life, the little dog who was sent to space by the Soviet in 1957, year the movie's story starts. "But one must compare", he says. And the comparison he makes with the dog is a reflexive one which seems totally unrelated with the movie but it's not. It's about the process of growing up, facing the unknown (or little known). Laika in the space, Ingemar on the ground with his eccentric uncles, new friends and far away from the very few people he knew: his sick mother and his brother, sent to another home. One has to be afraid of the unknown, to question it again and again but always compare. Maybe later one will know that aren't hard as it appear to be. It carries the same childhood innocence presented in Truffaut's "L'argent De Poche" which presented several sketches of kids getting involved in pranks, apparently harmless sometimes, other times involving great danger, but always discovering, learning something. It had its great dramatic moments but most of it was a collection of nostalgic and jolly images which brings back one of the most fundamental part of our lives: our childhood. What do we do those moments? Well, we compare it to our experiences (if you remember them) and observe if it was that difficult to break from one phase to another, and if we had strange and bitter days or wonderful and pleasant moments. We have to compare, you have to compare! Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m makes of this a glorious, beautiful and funny picture, one to be viewed multiple times not because it's difficult or peculiar but because of its graceful and delicacy, truly reward and temptive. Not only those, he extracted one of the greatest performances by a child actor. Glanzelius is natural, convincing and a true to joy to be seen acting. His Ingemar might have a strange optic of things, a puzzling behavior and a puzzling mannerism (the thing he does with the milk to quote an example) but there's plenty of admirable things to which any of us can relate to him. It's a shame he practically vanished from the movie business after giving one helluva of performance. The golden ticket that brought the director to Hollwyood after his Oscar nomination, this is Hallstr&ouml;m's best film to date. Not saying that "Chocolate" and "The Cider House Rules" don't have merits cause they have but gotta admit that Hollywood ruined a bit Mr. Hallstr&ouml;m's potential with all the awarded and nominated tearjerkers he made there, most of them flicks that go for the easy tears and easy targets. He's so much more effective with simple presentations, which mirrors life and are relevant to life, going deeper than anything. In "My Life as a Dog" he goes for the smiles and the positive emotions with glimpses of sadness. Sweet as childhood. But that's just my perspective. 10/10

    Ingemar is on the cusp of adolescence. It is the late 1950s Sweden. When the opening scene showed Ingemar on the beach amusing his mother with some childish antics, I was primed for a happy coming-of-age story. But then it is revealed that Ingemar is living at home with his mother who has tuberculosis. This sets the theme of the movie, just when you think things might be looking up for Ingemar, darker issues arise. Anton Glanzelius, who plays Ingemar, embodies a perfect combination of imp and winsomeness. He can cause adults grief with his trouble-making, but much of the time it is his innocence that gets him into trouble, like the time he has a small fire going in a trash dump that gets out of control, or the time he is suckered into an embarrassing prank at school. He has some odd behaviors, like approaching his milk glass with trepidation as if were one of life's great challenges to drink from it. When Ingemar becomes too much for his mother to handle he is sent to a small village down south to live with his uncle's family. This village has more than its share of eccentrics, like an older guy who is constantly repairing his roof, or the uncle's father who asks Ingemar to read to him from the lingerie section of a catalog. Much of the footage at the uncle's is gentle humor interspersed with typical trials of growing up. But then the mother dies. And so it goes. Ingemar has a delightful philosophical bent. As one way to deal with life's challenges he frequently tries to comfort himself by thinking that things could be worse. He keeps meditating on Laika, the dog that the Soviets sent into space in 1957, the first living animal sent up. In thinking of Laika, Ingemar comments, "You have to compare, so you can keep perspective. It helps to keep a little distance." He frets over the thought that Laika was sent into space knowing that he would most certainly starve to death. Maybe Ingemar sensed a wider metaphorical meaning--in some sense we are all shot into space at birth only ultimately to suffer the fate of certain death. The main musical theme perfectly captures the melancholic mood; its memory is one of the things that drew me to re-watch this after having first seen it over twenty years ago.

    At the end of the movie one finds out who was the dog whose life is being told. It isn't Laika sent in space at the onset of the movie, but the little boy who identifies with his dog who was put to sleep while he was away at his uncle's place. The little boys is from a modest background, grows up like the rest of the town, and faces problems many faced in those years. In his case his mom was sick and his dad was never home (had he ever been home?). At the uncle's place the boy slowly discovers other facets of the world, never losing his grace. Not much of a plot really. When I first heard about it, I thought this movie was going to suck big times, but my girlfriend of the time insisted to go see it. She was right.

Not only those, he extracted one of the greatest performances by a child actor. Glanzelius is natural, convincing and a true to joy to be seen acting. His Ingemar might have a strange optic of things, a puzzling behavior and a puzzling mannerism (the thing he does with the milk to quote an example) but there's plenty of admirable things to which any of us can relate to him. It's a shame he practically vanished from the movie business after giving one helluva of performance. The golden ticket that brought the director to Hollwyood after his Oscar nomination, this is Hallstr&ouml;m's best film to date. Not saying that "Chocolate" and "The Cider House Rules" don't have merits cause they have but gotta admit that Hollywood ruined a bit Mr. Hallstr&ouml;m's potential with all the awarded and nominated tearjerkers he made there, most of them flicks that go for the easy tears and easy targets. He's so much more effective with simple presentations, which mirrors life and are relevant to life, going deeper than anything. In "My Life as a Dog" he goes for the smiles and the positive emotions with glimpses of sadness. Sweet as childhood. But that's just my perspective. 10/10

    Ingemar is on the cusp of adolescence. It is the late 1950s Sweden. When the opening scene showed Ingemar on the beach amusing his mother with some childish antics, I was primed for a happy coming-of-age story. But then it is revealed that Ingemar is living at home with his mother who has tuberculosis. This sets the theme of the movie, just when you think things might be looking up for Ingemar, darker issues arise. Anton Glanzelius, who plays Ingemar, embodies a perfect combination of imp and winsomeness. He can cause adults grief with his trouble-making, but much of the time it is his innocence that gets him into trouble, like the time he has a small fire going in a trash dump that gets out of control, or the time he is suckered into an embarrassing prank at school. He has some odd behaviors, like approaching his milk glass with trepidation as if were one of life's great challenges to drink from it. When Ingemar becomes too much for his mother to handle he is sent to a small village down south to live with his uncle's family. This village has more than its share of eccentrics, like an older guy who is constantly repairing his roof, or the uncle's father who asks Ingemar to read to him from the lingerie section of a catalog. Much of the footage at the uncle's is gentle humor interspersed with typical trials of growing up. But then the mother dies. And so it goes. Ingemar has a delightful philosophical bent. As one way to deal with life's challenges he frequently tries to comfort himself by thinking that things could be worse. He keeps meditating on Laika, the dog that the Soviets sent into space in 1957, the first living animal sent up. In thinking of Laika, Ingemar comments, "You have to compare, so you can keep perspective. It helps to keep a little distance." He frets over the thought that Laika was sent into space knowing that he would most certainly starve to death. Maybe Ingemar sensed a wider metaphorical meaning--in some sense we are all shot into space at birth only ultimately to suffer the fate of certain death. The main musical theme perfectly captures the melancholic mood; its memory is one of the things that drew me to re-watch this after having first seen it over twenty years ago.

    At the end of the movie one finds out who was the dog whose life is being told. It isn't Laika sent in space at the onset of the movie, but the little boy who identifies with his dog who was put to sleep while he was away at his uncle's place. The little boys is from a modest background, grows up like the rest of the town, and faces problems many faced in those years. In his case his mom was sick and his dad was never home (had he ever been home?). At the uncle's place the boy slowly discovers other facets of the world, never losing his grace. Not much of a plot really. When I first heard about it, I thought this movie was going to suck big times, but my girlfriend of the time insisted to go see it. She was right. It isn't the plot, but the events, the pace, the closeness to real life, the innocence of the early years, ... all these things add up to an amazing experience of almost going again through childhood. I am giving it a 9 because, theoretically, there could be better movies out there, although it's gonna be tough to beat this one.

    I had high expectations for My Life as a Dog, and not only did the film meet those expectations it also surpassed them. I was really taken with the emotional core My Life as a Dog had. The scenes where Ingemar gets into mischief are fitfully amusing, but other scenes are very poignant too. I think some of the emotional resonance of the film comes from how truthful and warm My Life as a Dog is, there's even something very Truffautesque about it. My Life as a Dog has an evocative script, a compelling story and characters that feel real, you immediately connect with Ingemar and do so right up to the last second. Lasse Hallstrom directs beautifully, the film looks gorgeous in photography and production values, the score is haunting and Anton Glanzelius's lead performance is astonishing combining charm and wit with innocence and spirit. Overall, a truly wonderful movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    I thought this was a strange movie. It has so many good critiques that I expected something better. It was good at times, but aside that it was downright dull and with mostly unlikeable characters. Despite being a drama, it isn't as involving and deep as a drama should be. I'd like to sympathize more with the lead character, Ingemar, but I can't always do that. He is hard to evaluate: he isn't annoying, but he ain't sweet peer either. He often seemed like a retard due to his sometimes erratic behavior (such as barking like a dog). Still, he is wonderfully portrayed by the actor Anton Glanzelius. Saga, the tomboy, was another complicated character. She is supposed to like Ingemar, and yet she shows her love for him in a strange manner: by beating him up in a boxing match and hugging him during or after that. She is well played by Melinda Kinnaman. This film makes reference to Laika's story a cup of times. Despite his problems, Ingemar often seeks solace by reciting the tragic story of Laika the space dog. That is one good thing about this film, bringing some poetry and some soul to it. The Swedish film-making and cinematography is another solid point, thanks to the natural beauty of the sunny settings and the characteristic snow and freezy nordic weather. There have been complains about child nudity. What is it with everybody and this paranoia over pedophilia? Just because of one scene of child nudity in a film they already think it's pedophilia. It's scary how people got paranoid.

    This is one of the most touching, challenging, downright delightful movies I've seen. It is a portrayal of the coming of age of a young trouble maker whose life is in disrepair. His mother has been victimized by disease and she has this incorrigible little boy whom she loves but can't control. He is suffering from no love and seeks it out where he can. He is the paragon of attention deficit disorder. The movie isn't morose, however. He is genuinely funny and loving when he has the chance to be. He is sent to live with relatives where his life opens up and he begins to have purpose. He is given some latitude and begins to develop a real life. Unfortunately, there are events going on around him that will impact him, including the continuing deterioration of his mother's health and the little dog he left behind. He has so little power in his life as is the case with most little boys, and at times he tries to hard. One delightful connection is a young girl who is a better athlete than the boys in the town. There is this sexual tension that takes place as she matures and begins to fall for him. It is happy and sad and has a lovely message about grasping life whenever we can. See this.

    A mischievous young boy with a Puckish smile, unusual table manners, and a sympathetic kinship to Laika the Soviet astro-dog is sent by his ailing mother to live with relatives in the country, where he discovers a town full of people even more eccentric than himself. Director Lasse Hallstrom's popular Swedish import offers a refreshing look at the mysteries and heartbreak of adolescence, with all the charm but none of the cloying sentiment of other, similar coming-of-age films. The rich humor is drawn around an affectionate portrait of small town life, closely observed; the pain comes from the realization that young Ingmar's bedridden mother has already passed away. The pace is often lazy and the film is overlong, but Hallstrom's understanding of human idiosyncrasies is reminiscent of a Jacques Tati comedy, choosing to laugh with instead of at his characters. It's a memorable look at love and mortality, as seen from the innocent eyes of a boy passing through that awkward age when he begins thinking like an adult while still unable to stop acting like a child.

    The film was nominated for, and won, several awards across the world, but the specter of Bergman still lingers over the film, even if oppositionally. The Swedes depicted on screen are nothing like those in the Bergman universe. They are not rich, depressed, and well educated. Ingemar and his brother and mother live in a shanty house slum, and his uncle's country place is only a little nicer, even if the scenery is much more wholesome. And despite having far more reason to moan than Bergman's characters do, Ingemar is marked by a perseverance one can only refer to as 'dogged.' The cinematography by J&ouml;rgen Persson is solid, although there is a repeated static shot of the cosmos, whenever Ingemar gets reflective, that looks like something from a 1950s sci fi film where the word 'Science!' is spoken ecstatically, which should have been made to look a bit more engaging. Granted, this might be the typical textbook sort of photo that a child would associate with outer space in those days, but it still drags on the often deeper narration Ingemar provides, and simply looks cheap. While the film was based upon a novel with the same title, written by Reidar Jonsson, and the screenplay was written by Hallstr&ouml;m, Jonsson, and Brasse Brannstrom and Per Berglund, the character of Ingemar succeeds less on the words the character speaks, and mostly on the uncanny acting ability- or even inability, of Glanzelius- who never had another major starring role. There is just something 'off' about little Ingemar, something which, as reflected in the screenplay, is missing in comparison to Glanzelius's portrayal. The text would lead one to believe Ingemar is just another kid, if perhaps one a bit 'off,' yet Glanzelius's unaffected portrayal reveals him to be perhaps 'slow' or borderline 'autistic'- as he might now be labeled, especially when he goes on all fours and barks like a dog or cannot drink from a glass in public without spilling the liquid all over himself. Then there is the actor's very appearance, which has an odd, almost maniacal twinkle in his mien, akin to a young Jack Nicholson's. All in all, My Life As A Dog is a good non-Hollywood Hollywood film, albeit a deeper one, without forced emotions. It is a film that hints at a promise Hallstr&ouml;m has yet to fulfill, opening up the query over whether or not it is better to never fill potential by existence and failure or by not existing at all. Perhaps Ingemar already thought that through whilst pondering that dog high above his own canine plight?

    "My Life as a Dog" is a simple story about a 12 year old, mischievous boy, who is trying to find his way. He has a brother that he does not really get along with, a mother who is getting progressively sicker, and a dog who gives him the love that he is not able to get from either his mother or brother. To help his mother recover, he is sent packing, off to live for the summer with an uncle, where he finds a place to fit in, and friends and neighbors who are just as "strange" and mischievous. The film is a memory, neither romanticized or critical of either the boy or his family and friends. It simply tells the tale of a boy on the verge of puberty and the confusing feelings that he experiences. I didn't like the repetitive nature of the narration that occurs throughout the film, but I found myself drawn into the story and the characters. Lasse Hallstrom does a marvelous job of getting genuine, honest performances from all of his actors, who are all excellent. 8 out of 10

    This is nothing more than Swedish porn. And to make matters worse, it even qualifies in the category of child porn. Guess the Swedes enjoy that type of smut. This film should be shown in theaters that cater to that type of smut. I can think of two areas that would like to show it. They are Time Square in NYC and Harry Hines Blvd in Dallas, TX. The acting was very amateur and the characters never defined their personalities. All in all, I am grateful that I did not have to spend any money to view this tripe. Also, I noticed that the film itself was in poor shape with a lot of film gate damage.
