  When Andrew Sterling, a successful black urbanite writer buys a vacation home on a resort in New England the police mistake him for a burglar. After surrounding his home with armed men, Chief Tolliver realizes his mistake and to avoid the bad publicity offers a thief in his jail, Amos Odell a deal. Amos is to pretend to take Andrew prisoner and hold him for ransom but let him go and escape. Amos and Andrew suddenly realize that the Chief's problems are all gone if the two of them both die in a gun battle.

Amos is to pretend to take Andrew prisoner and hold him for ransom but let him go and escape. The pair realise that the Chief's problems are all gone if the two of them both die in a gun battle...... So the whole film is supposed to be a topical satire on how suburbanites are supposed to typecast people of different ethnicities. Does it work? No. Did I find it offensive? Yes. The writer of this poison, has basically depicted everyone who live on the island apart from Andrew, as moronic Neanderthals from the dark ages, who are fascinated with status and fame. Cage just plays an idiot, plain and simple, and Jackson is basically a calmer version of Zeus from Die Hard 3, who feels oppressed, and this is supposed to be funny? Its not funny, I couldn't think of anybody who wouldn't be offended by this, because the subject matter is dealt with like a soiled nappy. Its no wonder it never got a theatrical release here in the UK. Its a big thing to say this, but its Cages most awful film, and I've seen Deadfall and Stolen..

    One on those rare DVD I've purchased and watch when I need to relax and have a laugh. Nicky Cage is amazing in it and Jackson is as versatile as always. I can't help smiling watching Dabney Coleman (remembering him as Merle Jeeter in the Mary Hartman sitcom). I just love this movie. It's just clean fun and daring to show on screen the preconceived and non-politically correct concepts that some people have. I had this movie in a VHS format and could not help getting it in a DVD format. This is a comedy classic that you should purchase just to be able to watch it when you feel like it. So get some popcorn, get the family and friends around the screen and have a good time.

    This is a very good comedy that has you laughing regularly! The acting is superb! The plot is excellent with an accelerating number of screw ups that in the end reaches a very satisfying conclusion. A lot of so called comedies have one or two laughs in them and they've gotten better ratings than this show. This show is full of laughs and crazy situations that leave you wishing they had made a sequel. I have watched this show several times and will do so again because it is that good. If I have company and people want to watch a comedy I may drag this movie out as not many people have seen it. It always gets a positive review and a lot of laughs. Anyone rating this movie less than a 7 at least should see a therapist!

    Nicolas Cage plays a low life loser in the jail in the Hamptons. Samuel Jackson plays a Nobel prize winning man moving into the Hamptons. While moving in to his new house the neighbors see Jackson carrying stereo equipment; they call the cops because "when you see a black man with an armful of stereo equipment on this island you know damn good and well what is going on!" Let the comedy begin! Structurally the story well put together with excellent foreshadowing and dialogue. This is a comedy with a purpose. This is a story about white\black race relations in America and is very relevant today. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen in my life!

    A noted black author (Samuel L. Jackson), mistaken for a prowler in his own house, is pinned down by the local Keystone Kops, and police chief Dabney Coleman tries to cover the goof by giving white trash petty criminal Nicholas Cage a loaded shotgun so he can pretend to hold Jackson hostage for a few minutes. Why Coleman didn't think to begin this unlikely charade at the moment of arrest is anyone's guess, but Cage (of course) plays it for real, with entirely predictable consequences. This is one of those strictly formula comedies built around an escalating series of misunderstandings, the first of which is the assumption that the average intelligence of its target audience is somewhere around the kindergarten level. Bright spots are provided by Brad Dourif in one of his reliable psycho supporting roles, and by Brad Balaban as a touchy-feely criminal psychologist (doing a perfect imitation of Fred Rogers crossed with Leo Buscaglia). Otherwise this witless farce offers further proof that you can't trust any movie advertised on the side of a bus: it's not even smart enough to qualify as dumb fun.

    The arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr., Harvard University's top expert on African-American history and culture, sounded a familiar note, the plot of AMOS AND ANDREW. Samuel L. Jackson playing an internationally known author is presumed to be a burglar in his own home by passers-by. A siege of his home by local police caricatures the Cambridge police department. The film's supporting cast of Michael Lerner and Margaret Colin as well as Dabney Coleman make this a light comic view of what could have become a raw, racial confrontation. Leonard Maltin after commenting that this was like a 1960's Disney film, continues, "maybe they should have called this THAT DARN AFRO-American. If Nicholas Cage played his role with more fervor the IMDb rating would be higher. But in view of current events, screenings should skyrocket.

    Recap: Andrews first day in his new home is not a happy one. Mistaken for a burglar in his own house, he soon finds himself the hostage in a situation planned by the local chief of police. Comments: A surprisingly good comedy. I like movies that start quite slowly but that speeds up with every twist and turn. This is a plot where everything starts out nice and easy but that become increasingly more complicated (for the characters) with every attempt to solve everything. Soon everybody finds themselves in a mess no one can escape. And with every turn, it becomes funnier. So, it surely works as a fun entertainment when you're tired. And if you want, there are some seeds of real importance that you can ponder upon. But really, just enjoy the laughs. 7/10

    Andrew Sterling (Samuel L. Jackson) is very successful writer and a winner of Pulitzer award; and he decides to buy a vacation home on a resort in New England. In front of his house police mistakes him for a burglar. Soon Chief Tolliver (Dabney Coleman) realizes his mistake and to avoid the bad publicity, in election year, he offers Amos Odell (Nicolas Cage) a deal. Amos is just another ordinary thief, who has to pretend to take Andrew as prisoner and hold him for ransom but let him go and escape. But everything doesn't go according to the plan. Amos & Andrew is just another light comedy that you shouldn't take too seriously. It has two great actors: Cage and Jackson and few funny situations. The important part of the whole story is white and black people in America. Director E. Max Frye really puts this issue in the middle of the story and he doesn't steps on any side. He showed white people who only cares about money and power, just like Chief Tolliver (in election year). He showed black people who are obsessed with that felling that they are different from others (Andrew Sterling, Reverend Fenton Brunch) and that white people are always trying to back them down. Actually only positive character is Amos Odell. And he is criminal. Ironic, isn't it?

    A few years ago when I first saw a poster with Samuel and Nicolas, I immediatelly rented this movie. 'Cause I am a great fan of both and knowing that they are legendary actors I haven't imagine that this movie could be so average. But now I realized that. However this movie isn't bad at all. Story is interesting,some jokes are really good,Sam and Nicolas are a great couple , but I think that directing is most negative side of this motion picture. And maby Max Frye is the one who should be blamed because "Amos & Andrew" is so disappointing movie. Actually without of Sam and Nicolas this movie would be a complete disaster. At the end, I wouldn't recommend this movie to all who want a good comedy,but if you are a fan you can watch how your favourite actors made something more out of this movie.

    This film is possibly one of the funniest films ever. A seriously great flick which will make you laugh more than ones. Great acting, writing and directing and the plot is so brilliant that you want believe it. Samuel L. Jackson (one of the best actors alive plays Andrew Sterling a extremely rich and successful African American which has just bought a summer house on a "all white" island. The previous owners of the summer house has not told anybody that it was for sail and when two of the neighbors see him inside they naturally assume he is a criminal. He's nice car outside also make them believe he's holding the previous owners hostage and they call the police. The police assumes the same and over a little misunderstanding they start firing at him. When the realize how wrong they where the police chief (which is running for Major) makes a plan to justify everything and fool everyone so they make a deal with the life criminal Amos (played by Nicolas Cage) to stage a hostage situation against letting him get out of jail. But then the pres finds out about the story and the chief has to go back on his deal, unfortunately for him they both finds out the truth.

    A noted black author (Samuel L. Jackson), mistaken for a prowler in his own house, is pinned down by the local Keystone Kops, and police chief Dabney Coleman tries to cover the goof by giving white trash petty criminal Nicholas Cage a loaded shotgun so he can pretend to hold Jackson hostage for a few minutes. Why Coleman didn't think to begin this unlikely charade at the moment of arrest is anyone's guess, but Cage (of course) plays it for real, with entirely predictable consequences. This is one of those strictly formula comedies built around an escalating series of misunderstandings, the first of which is the assumption that the average intelligence of its target audience is somewhere around the kindergarten level. Bright spots are provided by Brad Dourif in one of his reliable psycho supporting roles, and by Brad Balaban as a touchy-feely criminal psychologist (doing a perfect imitation of Fred Rogers crossed with Leo Buscaglia). Otherwise this witless farce offers further proof that you can't trust any movie advertised on the side of a bus: it's not even smart enough to qualify as dumb fun.

    The arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr., Harvard University's top expert on African-American history and culture, sounded a familiar note, the plot of AMOS AND ANDREW. Samuel L. Jackson playing an internationally known author is presumed to be a burglar in his own home by passers-by. A siege of his home by local police caricatures the Cambridge police department. The film's supporting cast of Michael Lerner and Margaret Colin as well as Dabney Coleman make this a light comic view of what could have become a raw, racial confrontation. Leonard Maltin after commenting that this was like a 1960's Disney film, continues, "maybe they should have called this THAT DARN AFRO-American. If Nicholas Cage played his role with more fervor the IMDb rating would be higher. But in view of current events, screenings should skyrocket.

    Recap: Andrews first day in his new home is not a happy one. Mistaken for a burglar in his own house, he soon finds himself the hostage in a situation planned by the local chief of police. Comments: A surprisingly good comedy. I like movies that start quite slowly but that speeds up with every twist and turn. This is a plot where everything starts out nice and easy but that become increasingly more complicated (for the characters) with every attempt to solve everything. Soon everybody finds themselves in a mess no one can escape. And with every turn, it becomes funnier. So, it surely works as a fun entertainment when you're tired. And if you want, there are some seeds of real importance that you can ponder upon. But really, just enjoy the laughs. 7/10

    Andrew Sterling (Samuel L. Jackson) is very successful writer and a winner of Pulitzer award; and he decides to buy a vacation home on a resort in New England. In front of his house police mistakes him for a burglar. Soon Chief Tolliver (Dabney Coleman) realizes his mistake and to avoid the bad publicity, in election year, he offers Amos Odell (Nicolas Cage) a deal. Amos is just another ordinary thief, who has to pretend to take Andrew as prisoner and hold him for ransom but let him go and escape. But everything doesn't go according to the plan. Amos & Andrew is just another light comedy that you shouldn't take too seriously. It has two great actors: Cage and Jackson and few funny situations. The important part of the whole story is white and black people in America. Director E. Max Frye really puts this issue in the middle of the story and he doesn't steps on any side. He showed white people who only cares about money and power, just like Chief Tolliver (in election year). He showed black people who are obsessed with that felling that they are different from others (Andrew Sterling, Reverend Fenton Brunch) and that white people are always trying to back them down. Actually only positive character is Amos Odell. And he is criminal. Ironic, isn't it?

    A few years ago when I first saw a poster with Samuel and Nicolas, I immediatelly rented this movie. 'Cause I am a great fan of both and knowing that they are legendary actors I haven't imagine that this movie could be so average. But now I realized that. However this movie isn't bad at all. Story is interesting,some jokes are really good,Sam and Nicolas are a great couple , but I think that directing is most negative side of this motion picture. And maby Max Frye is the one who should be blamed because "Amos & Andrew" is so disappointing movie. Actually without of Sam and Nicolas this movie would be a complete disaster. At the end, I wouldn't recommend this movie to all who want a good comedy,but if you are a fan you can watch how your favourite actors made something more out of this movie.

    This film is possibly one of the funniest films ever. A seriously great flick which will make you laugh more than ones. Great acting, writing and directing and the plot is so brilliant that you want believe it. Samuel L. Jackson (one of the best actors alive plays Andrew Sterling a extremely rich and successful African American which has just bought a summer house on a "all white" island. The previous owners of the summer house has not told anybody that it was for sail and when two of the neighbors see him inside they naturally assume he is a criminal. He's nice car outside also make them believe he's holding the previous owners hostage and they call the police. The police assumes the same and over a little misunderstanding they start firing at him. When the realize how wrong they where the police chief (which is running for Major) makes a plan to justify everything and fool everyone so they make a deal with the life criminal Amos (played by Nicolas Cage) to stage a hostage situation against letting him get out of jail. But then the pres finds out about the story and the chief has to go back on his deal, unfortunately for him they both finds out the truth.
