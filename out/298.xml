 <sinopse>
  To foil an extortion plot, an FBI agent undergoes a face-transplant surgery and assumes the identity and physical appearance of a ruthless terrorist, but the plan backfires when the same criminal impersonates the cop with the same method.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Sean Archer, a very tough, rugged FBI Agent. Who is still grieving for his dead son Michael. Archer believes that his son's killer is his sworn enemy, a very powerful criminal, Castor Troy. One day, Archer has finally cornered Castor, however, their fight has knocked out Troy cold. As Archer finally breathes easy over the capture of his enemy, he finds out that Troy has planted a bomb that will destroy the entire city of Los Angeles and all of its inhabitants. Unfortunately the only other person who knows its location is Castor's brother Pollux, and he refuses to talk. The solution, a special operation doctor that can cut off people's faces, and can place a person's face onto another person. Archer undergoes one of those surgeries to talk to Pollux. However, Castor Troy somehow regains consciousness and now wants revenge on Archer for taking his face. Not only is Troy ruining Archer's mission, but his personal life as well. Archer must stop Troy again. This time, it's personal.

    Face/Off is the best John Woo Hollywood film by a mile. This had the budget, star power and a crazy, stupid script to carry his over the top style. It's a little long but that doesn't stop from being one of the most enjoyably stupid action films of the 90's. First off, we have two actors at their scenery chewing best - John Travolta and Nic Cage. We have great campy actors playing our main antagonist and hero. We have a crazy premise that they exploit to it's fullest potential, we have a decent story and character development sprinkled in and so on. Face/Off is more Hard Boiled and less The Killer or Better Tomorrow. Even at that, Hard Boiled is a much better action film and had a better cast. But for a Hollywood action film, Face/Off is hard to really compare it with something. And that's the best thing about it. Face/Off is a one of a kind film that only works because of the right people involved in the project. It's an over the top action extravaganza that has a story, characters and still manages to be absolutely insane.

    Everyone knows that both John Travolta and Nicolas Cage have strange acting careers  both of them starred in some great movies and both of them starred in some awful movies. Actually, nowadays it seems they act only in awful-to-average movies, which is a shame since I think both of them are talented actors. Face/Off is a 1997 action movie directed by the famous action movie director John Woo and it serves as a proof of how Cage and Travolta are really good actors. And it's also one of the better movies in both their careers. Face/Off is a story about two men  one is a cop named Sean Archer (John Travolta) and one is a crazy terrorist named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Troy has killed Archer's son several years ago and since then the two have been mortal enemies. One day Archer finally manages to capture Troy and accidentally puts him in a coma  but not before he finds out the place where Troy has put a bomb meant to explode in a couple of days. So, Archer undergoes heavy surgery and switches faces with Troy in an attempt to speak with Castor Troy's brother - Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola)  and find out where they planted the bomb. The plan backfires when Castor Troy wakes up from his coma and takes Archer's face. The two then start a dangerous game of cat and mouse. The best thing about Face/Off are the performances. Both Cage and Travolta had to play two completely different people with completely different personalities; and they were very successful in doing so. Interestingly enough both of them are better at playing the eccentric lunatic Castor Troy than in playing the part of the stoic cop Sean Archer. And if history taught us anything, it is that Nicolas Cage is absolutely amazing in playing crazy people. In the beginning of the movie, we see Cage dressed up as a priest who starts headbanging and dancing in front of a choir that is singing Hallelujah. If that's not a good enough reason to see this movie, I don't know what is. Although this is mainly a performance driven movie, the action in it is pretty decent and some action scenes were brilliantly directed. Unfortunately, other action scenes appeared to me as somewhat pretentious and overblown, mostly towards the end of the movie. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in action movies but it goes completely against the depressive tone of the rest of the movie. Face/Off is essentially a movie about identity crisis and dealing with the possibility of someone else living with your family; it doesn't need exaggerated action scenes. However, in spite of that, Face/Off is still a fun movie with wonderful performances that will leave you satisfied. It is a rather worthy collaboration of two talented actors who deserve much more out of their careers. Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    Face/Off is an outstanding movie with a breathtaking and intense storyline and magnificent performances all around.The two lead actors,John Travolta and Nicolas Cage,are amazing in this movie,they are two actors that I find very hit and miss,especially Nicolas Cage,an actor that I had never been really impressed with in the past,but I will forever respect both of these actors for their acting in this,they managed to pull off playing two different characters really well and stay through to the others personality,this didn't seem like something that would be easy to do,but Travolta and Cage pulled it off perfectly.I didn't see anything not to like about this movie and I don't know how it's not on the IMDb Top 250,it is a must see for fans of action and crime movies. Sean Archer (John Travolta) must stop a bomb set up by Caston Troy (Nicolas Cage),a terrorist who killed his son,by switching faces with him by a surgical operation,but he is put into prison and Caston disguised as Sean destroys every piece of evidence that they switched faces,so Sean must find a way to escape and prove who he really is.

    Hey, guys! This is not a chick-flick movie and for sure you're not going to say, "It's lame, so boring!" Face/off is a hardcore, breath-taking; action, crime, thriller movie directed by John Woo in 1997. John Woo is known for Mission Impossible II with Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. I love this movie; it's one of Nicolas Cage's movies I've ever watched aside from Con Air. This movie is all about this tough federal bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent, Sean Archer (John Travolta), who has been chasing to seize Caster Troy (Nicolas cage), the terrorist who has no conscience, mastermind behind bombings, assassinations, murder, kidnapping and the most dangerous and most brilliant criminal. John Travolta and his team found a way to capture Caster Troy (Nicolas Cage) through this black bag operation, but nobody should ever know about this suicidal operation, not even Sean Archer's wife, Dr. Eve Archer (Joan Allen). It's a plastic surgery procedure at Walsh Institute supervised by Dr. Walsh. The procedure will remove and switch each other's face. Meaning John Travolta will be Nicolas Cage and vice versa. Nicolas Cage planted a bomb at the L.A. Convention that only he and his brother Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola), know and the government is trying to figure out where this bomb is at. Meanwhile, after Caster Troy and his brother's police encounter at the private plane port, a plane's exhaust running hot, hit Caster Troy's body towards a huge screen vents which made him suffer comatose, but they caught Pollux Troy. FBI agents tried to interrogate people related to Caster Troy to find out the location of the bomb. Sean Archer even threat Sasha (Gina Gershon), Troy's girlfriend, that if she will not tell the truth, he'll take away her child. Sasha's brother asked Archer about his dead son, he's convince that Troy annihilate his son. Now, Sean Archer doesn't have any choice, but to say yes to their secluded mission. Agent Hollis convinced Sean Archer to do it, since Caster Troy is a turnip and he is the only one who can deactivate the bomb and besides, this will be the only way penalize and emplace Caster Troy behind bars from killing his loving son, Michael. Sean Archer went home to see his wife and daughter Jaime before the operation, he said, "I'll be gone for a while;" and promised that it will be the last and he will definite spend more time with his family. Sean Archer wished to Dr. Walsh; to put his gun shot scar back on his chest because it reminds him of his son, and gave Tito (FBI agent), his wedding ring; they've trimmed Archer's hair and planted a microchip into his larynx to duplicate Troy's voice. Archer didn't like wearing his enemy's face, he abruptly became violent, threw hospital mirror scintillating, cussed and swear everyone and cried, and knowing the next move is to lift him to Arrow One prison. There Archer is a citizen of nowhere, wearing a pair of boots made of metal, locked down on the floor surrounded by a ground full of magnetic field so, there's no way to escape. Meanwhile, at the Walsh Institute where they kept Caster Troy, he miraculously woke up from coma; removed his bandage and felt blood on his face. He called his friend with a husky, shaking, voice and told him that someone took his face off with a help of a doctor and two FBI agents. They abduct Dr. Walsh and the other two agents behind the operation, tied them up, poured gasoline on them and burnt them alive together with the evidences that will prove Sean Archer's real personality. In the Arrow One prison, Sean Archer got a visitorit's Caster Troy wearing his face and wedding ring, laughing crazy on how their mission failed and told Sean Archer (Troy's face), "I've got a government job to abuse and a wife to f***! Isn't that amazing?" teasing and making him mad. Archer's now finding out how to escape Arrow One prison to tell his wife Eve that he's Sean Archer. Face/Off is a great, action packed movie, tons of enigmatic scenes and stunts, big actors involved, with 7.3 stars, received lots of awards, a MUST watch movie.

    This a review I wrote for my blog (cagedcinema.tumblr.com) When I started this blog I wasn't quite sure with what film I'd want to kick off my reviews of the films of Nicolas Cage. His filmography is quite vast; clocking almost 70 films (and more to come). Also, the huge differences between some of his films (in quality and in tone/genre/style) make it hard to choose a good "entry-level" film that exemplifies the qualities of Nicolas Cage. Eventually, though, my eyes lay on John Woo's Face/Off: A film that perfectly introduces the screen presence of Cage. Please bear with me with the following description of the film's plot, because it's going to be complicated. Face/Off, John Woo's (Hardboiled, Mission: Impossible II) third American film, stars John Travolta as FBI Special Agent Sean Archer, a sober and driven man who dedicated his life to take revenge on freewheeling terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), the assassin of his son. The grief for his lost son results in Archer neglecting his wife and daughter; his wife hasn't had sex in months and his daughter is full of teenage angst. Quickly though, Archer seems to get his revenge when a vehicle and action packed shootout in and around an airport hanger results in Castor Troy getting incapacitated. The villain seems to be defeated, but problems arise: Troy has planted a chemical bomb somewhere in LA. Time is ticking and the main source for information regarding the whereabouts of the bomb, Castor Troy, is in a coma. In order to save the day, Sean Archer through an unlikely construction - has to become Castor Troy now to retrieve Intel on the bomb from Troy's paranoid and incarcerated brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola). This is where the plot gets interesting. A surgeon switches Sean's face with the face of Castor and alters the other bodily features of the reluctant agent. When Archer wakes up after the procedure, he wakes up in the body of his archenemy. Thus now Nicolas Cage has to act like he is the character of John Travolta! It gets even more interesting when, after Archer (still in the body of Troy/Cage) is being brought to the prison of Troy's brother, Castor Troy wakes up from his coma without a face. He forces the same surgeon to perform the opposite transplantation: Caster Troy becomes Sean Archer, Nicolas Cage becomes John Travolta. After the operation Troy makes sure to neatly erase all the evidence of this operation (read: killing everyone involved). Now the whole film revolts on the two actors acting like they are each other. This results in some brilliant bits. For instance John Travolta (with the personality of Cage's character) making fun of his own ridiculous chin, or Nicolas Cage (with the personality of Travolta's character) taking too much drugs with the villains henchmen: bragging probably tripping on drugs for the first time "I'm going to take his face Off!" while he is crawling over the floor. For both of the rivals the physical metamorphosis has severe psychological implications as well. Villain and womanizer Troy has to play a family man, while white knight Archer reluctantly has to hang out with criminal friends and followers of Troy. Archer even finds out, without Troy knowing that his nemesis has a son of his own. Although both characters are clearly not comfortable in their role  which becomes painfully clear by the laughing of the characters that evolves in pitiful cries  they both bring some of the qualities of their personality (Archers' conscience and Troy's joyful swagger) to the lives of their opponents. Still, this is all in between the over-the-top action scenes, with shootouts, set pieces and visual effects unlike any other film. Hyper stylized action scenes are a signature of John Woo, and this film is clearly no exception. Fireworks literally explode everywhere, while the hero and villain dive, roll and almost fly through the extravagant sets. In some films the action scenes can't really keep me interested because of their lack of emotional significance and originality, but this films absurd and sometimes hilarious sequencing kept me very excited. Juxtaposed against all the grotesque action scenes are the showdowns that take place on a more personal level. The encounters between the opponents throughout the film are executed very well. I found the showdown between Castor and Sean in a room full of mirrors very clever. Face/Off is very difficult film to follow. When the final "face-off" (pun inevitable) of the film draws near, it's not quite clear who is on whose side and why. Still, the film provides enough character development and motivation to keep its viewers interested in the plot. I have to say that this is maybe the action film with some of the most interesting character developments. Above all, the most enjoyable part of this film is seeing Nicolas Cage and John Travolta act like each other. Both deliver amazing performances. The script forces John Travolta to play outside of his body; including the typical Cage freak-outs and looks, while Cage's has to keep his performance more weighted; as if he is a prisoner of his own body. Still both of the actors, fortunately, get to show off their fame-making style of acting more than enough. Face/Off is a ridiculous film. With a premises that is full of gimmicks and ambiguities, action scenes that are unbelievably extravagant and a script full of cheesy lines ("It's like looking in the mirror, but only NOT"). Also it is a film made with passion and enthusiasm, screaming fun in almost every scene (some are quite sad though). This is a kind of action flick that doesn't get made in this day and age anymore. In the end Face/off also shows how Nicolas Cage can handle both his theatrical out-of-body style of acting and a more restricted and introvert role at once, therefore I think this is the perfect start for everyone interested in giving the cinema of Nicolas Cage a change.

    This movie has everything in it. From action to drama, love to hate, emotions to revenge, this has it all. Very well written and directed. But most of all the brilliance of two greats of Hollywood, Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. I would describe their performance as extreme of acting, beyond perfection. They absolutely made it an epic, how well they performed their and each other's role it's simply amazing. This movie is after 15 years is still the best in my list. I have watched it for like 50 times and every time I see it I even enjoy it more. I would highly recommend this to any action movie lover, go ahead and buy the DVD and watch it at your first chance.

    I am left with no other conclusion other than the producers of this movie went out and found any and all who in their poor taste in entertainment bought this video, or DVD. The mere notion that you can of simply removing someone's facing and surgically transplanting it onto someone else's skull to completely change their appearance is preposterous. I rented the video years ago from Blockbuster, probably not long after it hit the video store shelves. I can easily think of 5 Cage movies far better: 8 Millimeter, Lord Of War, Con Air, Match Stick Men, Thunder Birds, and Ghost Rider. I guess some people adore some actors so much no matter how poorly written the script is they will still praise the movie.

    This is a decent film, if you are able to look past the very poor sequence in the medical centre, where the face transplants supposedly take place, and the laughable scene where the surgeon 'calibrates' Archer's voice using an implanted microchip (how is this meant to work exactly?), to make it resemble Troy's. The film reminds me a lot of "The Hot Chick", where effectively the characters have switched bodies, and this leads to interesting complications. Although unlike The Hot Chick, in Face/Off the characters are both male. The way in which each man acts to try and fit the other's personality is sometimes comical, especially the scene where Archer is carousing with Troy's cohorts and has a difficult time impersonating the other man. The contrasting lifestyles of the two men make an interesting play on their attempts to mould themselves to the other's identity.

    Action guru John Woo's big budget bangathon featuring a lot of mayhem and fun. Travolta and Cage overact their butts/off. Very entertaining. Suspension of disbelief is a tag that is attached to all Movies. Without it nothing works. These things on the screen are not really happening. The plot, concepts, portrayals are all...FICTION. So given that you are suspending your disbelief, this has to be one of the most engaging stories ever to inhabit an over the top Action Movie with unbelievable gun-play and Comic-Book characters in a setting of another place and another time. John Woo is a master of flawless explosions and pretty pandemonium. Here there is quite a touching back story of Love lost and two families living unfamiliar, opposite lives. "The eternal struggle of Good vs Evil", says the bad guy. You bet, but it is all laid out in such style and confidence that it is overwhelmingly amazing. This is an example of excellence in a Genre that is ridiculously riddled with bullets but hardly ever so quintessential. This is one that all Movies of this type could aspire. For it is one of the best and succeeds in something that most of this type fail to accomplish. It has as much heart as it does heart pounding excitement.

    John Woo's intense camera, and editing is a remarkable feat in this film. The camera is always moving, always involved, and fast paced editing make for a powerful, action-packed movie. John Travolta gratefully hams his performance, alongside the demented acting of Nicolas Cage. The two actors are rightfully having a blast in this movie, playing outsized and campy action villains and heroes. However I find the movie lacking in its vapidity and many extraneous scenes. Many of the characters are poorly acted and written, and there is little sense in the story. Despite its style and masterful execution, I still find it lacking, even as a piece of pure fluff entertainment. The movie is outrageous and entertaining, but nevertheless, pretty horrendous.

Agent Hollis convinced Sean Archer to do it, since Caster Troy is a turnip and he is the only one who can deactivate the bomb and besides, this will be the only way penalize and emplace Caster Troy behind bars from killing his loving son, Michael. Sean Archer went home to see his wife and daughter Jaime before the operation, he said, "I'll be gone for a while;" and promised that it will be the last and he will definite spend more time with his family. Sean Archer wished to Dr. Walsh; to put his gun shot scar back on his chest because it reminds him of his son, and gave Tito (FBI agent), his wedding ring; they've trimmed Archer's hair and planted a microchip into his larynx to duplicate Troy's voice. Archer didn't like wearing his enemy's face, he abruptly became violent, threw hospital mirror scintillating, cussed and swear everyone and cried, and knowing the next move is to lift him to Arrow One prison. There Archer is a citizen of nowhere, wearing a pair of boots made of metal, locked down on the floor surrounded by a ground full of magnetic field so, there's no way to escape. Meanwhile, at the Walsh Institute where they kept Caster Troy, he miraculously woke up from coma; removed his bandage and felt blood on his face. He called his friend with a husky, shaking, voice and told him that someone took his face off with a help of a doctor and two FBI agents. They abduct Dr. Walsh and the other two agents behind the operation, tied them up, poured gasoline on them and burnt them alive together with the evidences that will prove Sean Archer's real personality. In the Arrow One prison, Sean Archer got a visitorit's Caster Troy wearing his face and wedding ring, laughing crazy on how their mission failed and told Sean Archer (Troy's face), "I've got a government job to abuse and a wife to f***! Isn't that amazing?" teasing and making him mad. Archer's now finding out how to escape Arrow One prison to tell his wife Eve that he's Sean Archer. Face/Off is a great, action packed movie, tons of enigmatic scenes and stunts, big actors involved, with 7.3 stars, received lots of awards, a MUST watch movie.

    This a review I wrote for my blog (cagedcinema.tumblr.com) When I started this blog I wasn't quite sure with what film I'd want to kick off my reviews of the films of Nicolas Cage. His filmography is quite vast; clocking almost 70 films (and more to come). Also, the huge differences between some of his films (in quality and in tone/genre/style) make it hard to choose a good "entry-level" film that exemplifies the qualities of Nicolas Cage. Eventually, though, my eyes lay on John Woo's Face/Off: A film that perfectly introduces the screen presence of Cage. Please bear with me with the following description of the film's plot, because it's going to be complicated. Face/Off, John Woo's (Hardboiled, Mission: Impossible II) third American film, stars John Travolta as FBI Special Agent Sean Archer, a sober and driven man who dedicated his life to take revenge on freewheeling terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), the assassin of his son. The grief for his lost son results in Archer neglecting his wife and daughter; his wife hasn't had sex in months and his daughter is full of teenage angst. Quickly though, Archer seems to get his revenge when a vehicle and action packed shootout in and around an airport hanger results in Castor Troy getting incapacitated. The villain seems to be defeated, but problems arise: Troy has planted a chemical bomb somewhere in LA. Time is ticking and the main source for information regarding the whereabouts of the bomb, Castor Troy, is in a coma. In order to save the day, Sean Archer through an unlikely construction - has to become Castor Troy now to retrieve Intel on the bomb from Troy's paranoid and incarcerated brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola). This is where the plot gets interesting. A surgeon switches Sean's face with the face of Castor and alters the other bodily features of the reluctant agent. When Archer wakes up after the procedure, he wakes up in the body of his archenemy. Thus now Nicolas Cage has to act like he is the character of John Travolta! It gets even more interesting when, after Archer (still in the body of Troy/Cage) is being brought to the prison of Troy's brother, Castor Troy wakes up from his coma without a face. He forces the same surgeon to perform the opposite transplantation: Caster Troy becomes Sean Archer, Nicolas Cage becomes John Travolta. After the operation Troy makes sure to neatly erase all the evidence of this operation (read: killing everyone involved). Now the whole film revolts on the two actors acting like they are each other. This results in some brilliant bits. For instance John Travolta (with the personality of Cage's character) making fun of his own ridiculous chin, or Nicolas Cage (with the personality of Travolta's character) taking too much drugs with the villains henchmen: bragging probably tripping on drugs for the first time "I'm going to take his face Off!" while he is crawling over the floor. For both of the rivals the physical metamorphosis has severe psychological implications as well. Villain and womanizer Troy has to play a family man, while white knight Archer reluctantly has to hang out with criminal friends and followers of Troy. Archer even finds out, without Troy knowing that his nemesis has a son of his own. Although both characters are clearly not comfortable in their role  which becomes painfully clear by the laughing of the characters that evolves in pitiful cries  they both bring some of the qualities of their personality (Archers' conscience and Troy's joyful swagger) to the lives of their opponents. Still, this is all in between the over-the-top action scenes, with shootouts, set pieces and visual effects unlike any other film. Hyper stylized action scenes are a signature of John Woo, and this film is clearly no exception. Fireworks literally explode everywhere, while the hero and villain dive, roll and almost fly through the extravagant sets. In some films the action scenes can't really keep me interested because of their lack of emotional significance and originality, but this films absurd and sometimes hilarious sequencing kept me very excited. Juxtaposed against all the grotesque action scenes are the showdowns that take place on a more personal level. The encounters between the opponents throughout the film are executed very well. I found the showdown between Castor and Sean in a room full of mirrors very clever. Face/Off is very difficult film to follow. When the final "face-off" (pun inevitable) of the film draws near, it's not quite clear who is on whose side and why. Still, the film provides enough character development and motivation to keep its viewers interested in the plot. I have to say that this is maybe the action film with some of the most interesting character developments. Above all, the most enjoyable part of this film is seeing Nicolas Cage and John Travolta act like each other. Both deliver amazing performances. The script forces John Travolta to play outside of his body; including the typical Cage freak-outs and looks, while Cage's has to keep his performance more weighted; as if he is a prisoner of his own body. Still both of the actors, fortunately, get to show off their fame-making style of acting more than enough. Face/Off is a ridiculous film. With a premises that is full of gimmicks and ambiguities, action scenes that are unbelievably extravagant and a script full of cheesy lines ("It's like looking in the mirror, but only NOT"). Also it is a film made with passion and enthusiasm, screaming fun in almost every scene (some are quite sad though). This is a kind of action flick that doesn't get made in this day and age anymore. In the end Face/off also shows how Nicolas Cage can handle both his theatrical out-of-body style of acting and a more restricted and introvert role at once, therefore I think this is the perfect start for everyone interested in giving the cinema of Nicolas Cage a change.

    This movie has everything in it. From action to drama, love to hate, emotions to revenge, this has it all. Very well written and directed. But most of all the brilliance of two greats of Hollywood, Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. I would describe their performance as extreme of acting, beyond perfection. They absolutely made it an epic, how well they performed their and each other's role it's simply amazing. This movie is after 15 years is still the best in my list. I have watched it for like 50 times and every time I see it I even enjoy it more. I would highly recommend this to any action movie lover, go ahead and buy the DVD and watch it at your first chance.

    I am left with no other conclusion other than the producers of this movie went out and found any and all who in their poor taste in entertainment bought this video, or DVD. The mere notion that you can of simply removing someone's facing and surgically transplanting it onto someone else's skull to completely change their appearance is preposterous. I rented the video years ago from Blockbuster, probably not long after it hit the video store shelves. I can easily think of 5 Cage movies far better: 8 Millimeter, Lord Of War, Con Air, Match Stick Men, Thunder Birds, and Ghost Rider. I guess some people adore some actors so much no matter how poorly written the script is they will still praise the movie.

    This is a decent film, if you are able to look past the very poor sequence in the medical centre, where the face transplants supposedly take place, and the laughable scene where the surgeon 'calibrates' Archer's voice using an implanted microchip (how is this meant to work exactly?), to make it resemble Troy's. The film reminds me a lot of "The Hot Chick", where effectively the characters have switched bodies, and this leads to interesting complications. Although unlike The Hot Chick, in Face/Off the characters are both male. The way in which each man acts to try and fit the other's personality is sometimes comical, especially the scene where Archer is carousing with Troy's cohorts and has a difficult time impersonating the other man. The contrasting lifestyles of the two men make an interesting play on their attempts to mould themselves to the other's identity.

    Action guru John Woo's big budget bangathon featuring a lot of mayhem and fun. Travolta and Cage overact their butts/off. Very entertaining. Suspension of disbelief is a tag that is attached to all Movies. Without it nothing works. These things on the screen are not really happening. The plot, concepts, portrayals are all...FICTION. So given that you are suspending your disbelief, this has to be one of the most engaging stories ever to inhabit an over the top Action Movie with unbelievable gun-play and Comic-Book characters in a setting of another place and another time. John Woo is a master of flawless explosions and pretty pandemonium. Here there is quite a touching back story of Love lost and two families living unfamiliar, opposite lives. "The eternal struggle of Good vs Evil", says the bad guy. You bet, but it is all laid out in such style and confidence that it is overwhelmingly amazing. This is an example of excellence in a Genre that is ridiculously riddled with bullets but hardly ever so quintessential. This is one that all Movies of this type could aspire. For it is one of the best and succeeds in something that most of this type fail to accomplish. It has as much heart as it does heart pounding excitement.

    John Woo's intense camera, and editing is a remarkable feat in this film. The camera is always moving, always involved, and fast paced editing make for a powerful, action-packed movie. John Travolta gratefully hams his performance, alongside the demented acting of Nicolas Cage. The two actors are rightfully having a blast in this movie, playing outsized and campy action villains and heroes. However I find the movie lacking in its vapidity and many extraneous scenes. Many of the characters are poorly acted and written, and there is little sense in the story. Despite its style and masterful execution, I still find it lacking, even as a piece of pure fluff entertainment. The movie is outrageous and entertaining, but nevertheless, pretty horrendous.

    Face/Off is the best John Woo Hollywood film by a mile. This had the budget, star power and a crazy, stupid script to carry his over the top style. It's a little long but that doesn't stop from being one of the most enjoyably stupid action films of the 90's. First off, we have two actors at their scenery chewing best - John Travolta and Nic Cage. We have great campy actors playing our main antagonist and hero. We have a crazy premise that they exploit to it's fullest potential, we have a decent story and character development sprinkled in and so on. Face/Off is more Hard Boiled and less The Killer or Better Tomorrow. Even at that, Hard Boiled is a much better action film and had a better cast. But for a Hollywood action film, Face/Off is hard to really compare it with something. And that's the best thing about it. Face/Off is a one of a kind film that only works because of the right people involved in the project. It's an over the top action extravaganza that has a story, characters and still manages to be absolutely insane.

    Everyone knows that both John Travolta and Nicolas Cage have strange acting careers  both of them starred in some great movies and both of them starred in some awful movies. Actually, nowadays it seems they act only in awful-to-average movies, which is a shame since I think both of them are talented actors. Face/Off is a 1997 action movie directed by the famous action movie director John Woo and it serves as a proof of how Cage and Travolta are really good actors. And it's also one of the better movies in both their careers. Face/Off is a story about two men  one is a cop named Sean Archer (John Travolta) and one is a crazy terrorist named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Troy has killed Archer's son several years ago and since then the two have been mortal enemies. One day Archer finally manages to capture Troy and accidentally puts him in a coma  but not before he finds out the place where Troy has put a bomb meant to explode in a couple of days. So, Archer undergoes heavy surgery and switches faces with Troy in an attempt to speak with Castor Troy's brother - Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola)  and find out where they planted the bomb. The plan backfires when Castor Troy wakes up from his coma and takes Archer's face. The two then start a dangerous game of cat and mouse. The best thing about Face/Off are the performances. Both Cage and Travolta had to play two completely different people with completely different personalities; and they were very successful in doing so. Interestingly enough both of them are better at playing the eccentric lunatic Castor Troy than in playing the part of the stoic cop Sean Archer. And if history taught us anything, it is that Nicolas Cage is absolutely amazing in playing crazy people. In the beginning of the movie, we see Cage dressed up as a priest who starts headbanging and dancing in front of a choir that is singing Hallelujah. If that's not a good enough reason to see this movie, I don't know what is. Although this is mainly a performance driven movie, the action in it is pretty decent and some action scenes were brilliantly directed. Unfortunately, other action scenes appeared to me as somewhat pretentious and overblown, mostly towards the end of the movie. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in action movies but it goes completely against the depressive tone of the rest of the movie. Face/Off is essentially a movie about identity crisis and dealing with the possibility of someone else living with your family; it doesn't need exaggerated action scenes. However, in spite of that, Face/Off is still a fun movie with wonderful performances that will leave you satisfied. It is a rather worthy collaboration of two talented actors who deserve much more out of their careers. Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    Face/Off is an outstanding movie with a breathtaking and intense storyline and magnificent performances all around.The two lead actors,John Travolta and Nicolas Cage,are amazing in this movie,they are two actors that I find very hit and miss,especially Nicolas Cage,an actor that I had never been really impressed with in the past,but I will forever respect both of these actors for their acting in this,they managed to pull off playing two different characters really well and stay through to the others personality,this didn't seem like something that would be easy to do,but Travolta and Cage pulled it off perfectly.I didn't see anything not to like about this movie and I don't know how it's not on the IMDb Top 250,it is a must see for fans of action and crime movies. Sean Archer (John Travolta) must stop a bomb set up by Caston Troy (Nicolas Cage),a terrorist who killed his son,by switching faces with him by a surgical operation,but he is put into prison and Caston disguised as Sean destroys every piece of evidence that they switched faces,so Sean must find a way to escape and prove who he really is.

    Hey, guys! This is not a chick-flick movie and for sure you're not going to say, "It's lame, so boring!" Face/off is a hardcore, breath-taking; action, crime, thriller movie directed by John Woo in 1997. John Woo is known for Mission Impossible II with Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. I love this movie; it's one of Nicolas Cage's movies I've ever watched aside from Con Air. This movie is all about this tough federal bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent, Sean Archer (John Travolta), who has been chasing to seize Caster Troy (Nicolas cage), the terrorist who has no conscience, mastermind behind bombings, assassinations, murder, kidnapping and the most dangerous and most brilliant criminal. John Travolta and his team found a way to capture Caster Troy (Nicolas Cage) through this black bag operation, but nobody should ever know about this suicidal operation, not even Sean Archer's wife, Dr. Eve Archer (Joan Allen). It's a plastic surgery procedure at Walsh Institute supervised by Dr. Walsh. The procedure will remove and switch each other's face. Meaning John Travolta will be Nicolas Cage and vice versa. Nicolas Cage planted a bomb at the L.A. Convention that only he and his brother Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola), know and the government is trying to figure out where this bomb is at. Meanwhile, after Caster Troy and his brother's police encounter at the private plane port, a plane's exhaust running hot, hit Caster Troy's body towards a huge screen vents which made him suffer comatose, but they caught Pollux Troy. FBI agents tried to interrogate people related to Caster Troy to find out the location of the bomb. Sean Archer even threat Sasha (Gina Gershon), Troy's girlfriend, that if she will not tell the truth, he'll take away her child. Sasha's brother asked Archer about his dead son, he's convince that Troy annihilate his son. Now, Sean Archer doesn't have any choice, but to say yes to their secluded mission. Agent Hollis convinced Sean Archer to do it, since Caster Troy is a turnip and he is the only one who can deactivate the bomb and besides, this will be the only way penalize and emplace Caster Troy behind bars from killing his loving son, Michael. Sean Archer went home to see his wife and daughter Jaime before the operation, he said, "I'll be gone for a while;" and promised that it will be the last and he will definite spend more time with his family. Sean Archer wished to Dr. Walsh; to put his gun shot scar back on his chest because it reminds him of his son, and gave Tito (FBI agent), his wedding ring; they've trimmed Archer's hair and planted a microchip into his larynx to duplicate Troy's voice. Archer didn't like wearing his enemy's face, he abruptly became violent, threw hospital mirror scintillating, cussed and swear everyone and cried, and knowing the next move is to lift him to Arrow One prison. There Archer is a citizen of nowhere, wearing a pair of boots made of metal, locked down on the floor surrounded by a ground full of magnetic field so, there's no way to escape. Meanwhile, at the Walsh Institute where they kept Caster Troy, he miraculously woke up from coma; removed his bandage and felt blood on his face. He called his friend with a husky, shaking, voice and told him that someone took his face off with a help of a doctor and two FBI agents. They abduct Dr. Walsh and the other two agents behind the operation, tied them up, poured gasoline on them and burnt them alive together with the evidences that will prove Sean Archer's real personality. In the Arrow One prison, Sean Archer got a visitorit's Caster Troy wearing his face and wedding ring, laughing crazy on how their mission failed and told Sean Archer (Troy's face), "I've got a government job to abuse and a wife to f***! Isn't that amazing?" teasing and making him mad. Archer's now finding out how to escape Arrow One prison to tell his wife Eve that he's Sean Archer. Face/Off is a great, action packed movie, tons of enigmatic scenes and stunts, big actors involved, with 7.3 stars, received lots of awards, a MUST watch movie.

The film reminds me a lot of "The Hot Chick", where effectively the characters have switched bodies, and this leads to interesting complications. Although unlike The Hot Chick, in Face/Off the characters are both male. The way in which each man acts to try and fit the other's personality is sometimes comical, especially the scene where Archer is carousing with Troy's cohorts and has a difficult time impersonating the other man. The contrasting lifestyles of the two men make an interesting play on their attempts to mould themselves to the other's identity.

    Action guru John Woo's big budget bangathon featuring a lot of mayhem and fun. Travolta and Cage overact their butts/off. Very entertaining. Suspension of disbelief is a tag that is attached to all Movies. Without it nothing works. These things on the screen are not really happening. The plot, concepts, portrayals are all...FICTION. So given that you are suspending your disbelief, this has to be one of the most engaging stories ever to inhabit an over the top Action Movie with unbelievable gun-play and Comic-Book characters in a setting of another place and another time. John Woo is a master of flawless explosions and pretty pandemonium. Here there is quite a touching back story of Love lost and two families living unfamiliar, opposite lives. "The eternal struggle of Good vs Evil", says the bad guy. You bet, but it is all laid out in such style and confidence that it is overwhelmingly amazing. This is an example of excellence in a Genre that is ridiculously riddled with bullets but hardly ever so quintessential. This is one that all Movies of this type could aspire. For it is one of the best and succeeds in something that most of this type fail to accomplish. It has as much heart as it does heart pounding excitement.

    John Woo's intense camera, and editing is a remarkable feat in this film. The camera is always moving, always involved, and fast paced editing make for a powerful, action-packed movie. John Travolta gratefully hams his performance, alongside the demented acting of Nicolas Cage. The two actors are rightfully having a blast in this movie, playing outsized and campy action villains and heroes. However I find the movie lacking in its vapidity and many extraneous scenes. Many of the characters are poorly acted and written, and there is little sense in the story. Despite its style and masterful execution, I still find it lacking, even as a piece of pure fluff entertainment. The movie is outrageous and entertaining, but nevertheless, pretty horrendous.

    Face/Off is the best John Woo Hollywood film by a mile. This had the budget, star power and a crazy, stupid script to carry his over the top style. It's a little long but that doesn't stop from being one of the most enjoyably stupid action films of the 90's. First off, we have two actors at their scenery chewing best - John Travolta and Nic Cage. We have great campy actors playing our main antagonist and hero. We have a crazy premise that they exploit to it's fullest potential, we have a decent story and character development sprinkled in and so on. Face/Off is more Hard Boiled and less The Killer or Better Tomorrow. Even at that, Hard Boiled is a much better action film and had a better cast. But for a Hollywood action film, Face/Off is hard to really compare it with something. And that's the best thing about it. Face/Off is a one of a kind film that only works because of the right people involved in the project. It's an over the top action extravaganza that has a story, characters and still manages to be absolutely insane.

    Everyone knows that both John Travolta and Nicolas Cage have strange acting careers  both of them starred in some great movies and both of them starred in some awful movies. Actually, nowadays it seems they act only in awful-to-average movies, which is a shame since I think both of them are talented actors. Face/Off is a 1997 action movie directed by the famous action movie director John Woo and it serves as a proof of how Cage and Travolta are really good actors. And it's also one of the better movies in both their careers. Face/Off is a story about two men  one is a cop named Sean Archer (John Travolta) and one is a crazy terrorist named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Troy has killed Archer's son several years ago and since then the two have been mortal enemies. One day Archer finally manages to capture Troy and accidentally puts him in a coma  but not before he finds out the place where Troy has put a bomb meant to explode in a couple of days. So, Archer undergoes heavy surgery and switches faces with Troy in an attempt to speak with Castor Troy's brother - Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola)  and find out where they planted the bomb. The plan backfires when Castor Troy wakes up from his coma and takes Archer's face. The two then start a dangerous game of cat and mouse. The best thing about Face/Off are the performances. Both Cage and Travolta had to play two completely different people with completely different personalities; and they were very successful in doing so. Interestingly enough both of them are better at playing the eccentric lunatic Castor Troy than in playing the part of the stoic cop Sean Archer. And if history taught us anything, it is that Nicolas Cage is absolutely amazing in playing crazy people. In the beginning of the movie, we see Cage dressed up as a priest who starts headbanging and dancing in front of a choir that is singing Hallelujah. If that's not a good enough reason to see this movie, I don't know what is. Although this is mainly a performance driven movie, the action in it is pretty decent and some action scenes were brilliantly directed. Unfortunately, other action scenes appeared to me as somewhat pretentious and overblown, mostly towards the end of the movie. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in action movies but it goes completely against the depressive tone of the rest of the movie. Face/Off is essentially a movie about identity crisis and dealing with the possibility of someone else living with your family; it doesn't need exaggerated action scenes. However, in spite of that, Face/Off is still a fun movie with wonderful performances that will leave you satisfied. It is a rather worthy collaboration of two talented actors who deserve much more out of their careers. Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    Face/Off is an outstanding movie with a breathtaking and intense storyline and magnificent performances all around.The two lead actors,John Travolta and Nicolas Cage,are amazing in this movie,they are two actors that I find very hit and miss,especially Nicolas Cage,an actor that I had never been really impressed with in the past,but I will forever respect both of these actors for their acting in this,they managed to pull off playing two different characters really well and stay through to the others personality,this didn't seem like something that would be easy to do,but Travolta and Cage pulled it off perfectly.I didn't see anything not to like about this movie and I don't know how it's not on the IMDb Top 250,it is a must see for fans of action and crime movies. Sean Archer (John Travolta) must stop a bomb set up by Caston Troy (Nicolas Cage),a terrorist who killed his son,by switching faces with him by a surgical operation,but he is put into prison and Caston disguised as Sean destroys every piece of evidence that they switched faces,so Sean must find a way to escape and prove who he really is.

    Hey, guys! This is not a chick-flick movie and for sure you're not going to say, "It's lame, so boring!" Face/off is a hardcore, breath-taking; action, crime, thriller movie directed by John Woo in 1997. John Woo is known for Mission Impossible II with Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. I love this movie; it's one of Nicolas Cage's movies I've ever watched aside from Con Air. This movie is all about this tough federal bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent, Sean Archer (John Travolta), who has been chasing to seize Caster Troy (Nicolas cage), the terrorist who has no conscience, mastermind behind bombings, assassinations, murder, kidnapping and the most dangerous and most brilliant criminal. John Travolta and his team found a way to capture Caster Troy (Nicolas Cage) through this black bag operation, but nobody should ever know about this suicidal operation, not even Sean Archer's wife, Dr. Eve Archer (Joan Allen). It's a plastic surgery procedure at Walsh Institute supervised by Dr. Walsh. The procedure will remove and switch each other's face. Meaning John Travolta will be Nicolas Cage and vice versa. Nicolas Cage planted a bomb at the L.A. Convention that only he and his brother Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola), know and the government is trying to figure out where this bomb is at. Meanwhile, after Caster Troy and his brother's police encounter at the private plane port, a plane's exhaust running hot, hit Caster Troy's body towards a huge screen vents which made him suffer comatose, but they caught Pollux Troy. FBI agents tried to interrogate people related to Caster Troy to find out the location of the bomb. Sean Archer even threat Sasha (Gina Gershon), Troy's girlfriend, that if she will not tell the truth, he'll take away her child. Sasha's brother asked Archer about his dead son, he's convince that Troy annihilate his son. Now, Sean Archer doesn't have any choice, but to say yes to their secluded mission. Agent Hollis convinced Sean Archer to do it, since Caster Troy is a turnip and he is the only one who can deactivate the bomb and besides, this will be the only way penalize and emplace Caster Troy behind bars from killing his loving son, Michael. Sean Archer went home to see his wife and daughter Jaime before the operation, he said, "I'll be gone for a while;" and promised that it will be the last and he will definite spend more time with his family. Sean Archer wished to Dr. Walsh; to put his gun shot scar back on his chest because it reminds him of his son, and gave Tito (FBI agent), his wedding ring; they've trimmed Archer's hair and planted a microchip into his larynx to duplicate Troy's voice. Archer didn't like wearing his enemy's face, he abruptly became violent, threw hospital mirror scintillating, cussed and swear everyone and cried, and knowing the next move is to lift him to Arrow One prison. There Archer is a citizen of nowhere, wearing a pair of boots made of metal, locked down on the floor surrounded by a ground full of magnetic field so, there's no way to escape. Meanwhile, at the Walsh Institute where they kept Caster Troy, he miraculously woke up from coma; removed his bandage and felt blood on his face. He called his friend with a husky, shaking, voice and told him that someone took his face off with a help of a doctor and two FBI agents. They abduct Dr. Walsh and the other two agents behind the operation, tied them up, poured gasoline on them and burnt them alive together with the evidences that will prove Sean Archer's real personality. In the Arrow One prison, Sean Archer got a visitorit's Caster Troy wearing his face and wedding ring, laughing crazy on how their mission failed and told Sean Archer (Troy's face), "I've got a government job to abuse and a wife to f***! Isn't that amazing?" teasing and making him mad. Archer's now finding out how to escape Arrow One prison to tell his wife Eve that he's Sean Archer. Face/Off is a great, action packed movie, tons of enigmatic scenes and stunts, big actors involved, with 7.3 stars, received lots of awards, a MUST watch movie.

    This a review I wrote for my blog (cagedcinema.tumblr.com) When I started this blog I wasn't quite sure with what film I'd want to kick off my reviews of the films of Nicolas Cage. His filmography is quite vast; clocking almost 70 films (and more to come). Also, the huge differences between some of his films (in quality and in tone/genre/style) make it hard to choose a good "entry-level" film that exemplifies the qualities of Nicolas Cage. Eventually, though, my eyes lay on John Woo's Face/Off: A film that perfectly introduces the screen presence of Cage. Please bear with me with the following description of the film's plot, because it's going to be complicated. Face/Off, John Woo's (Hardboiled, Mission: Impossible II) third American film, stars John Travolta as FBI Special Agent Sean Archer, a sober and driven man who dedicated his life to take revenge on freewheeling terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), the assassin of his son. The grief for his lost son results in Archer neglecting his wife and daughter; his wife hasn't had sex in months and his daughter is full of teenage angst. Quickly though, Archer seems to get his revenge when a vehicle and action packed shootout in and around an airport hanger results in Castor Troy getting incapacitated. The villain seems to be defeated, but problems arise: Troy has planted a chemical bomb somewhere in LA. Time is ticking and the main source for information regarding the whereabouts of the bomb, Castor Troy, is in a coma. In order to save the day, Sean Archer through an unlikely construction - has to become Castor Troy now to retrieve Intel on the bomb from Troy's paranoid and incarcerated brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola). This is where the plot gets interesting. A surgeon switches Sean's face with the face of Castor and alters the other bodily features of the reluctant agent. When Archer wakes up after the procedure, he wakes up in the body of his archenemy. Thus now Nicolas Cage has to act like he is the character of John Travolta! It gets even more interesting when, after Archer (still in the body of Troy/Cage) is being brought to the prison of Troy's brother, Castor Troy wakes up from his coma without a face. He forces the same surgeon to perform the opposite transplantation: Caster Troy becomes Sean Archer, Nicolas Cage becomes John Travolta. After the operation Troy makes sure to neatly erase all the evidence of this operation (read: killing everyone involved). Now the whole film revolts on the two actors acting like they are each other. This results in some brilliant bits. For instance John Travolta (with the personality of Cage's character) making fun of his own ridiculous chin, or Nicolas Cage (with the personality of Travolta's character) taking too much drugs with the villains henchmen: bragging probably tripping on drugs for the first time "I'm going to take his face Off!" while he is crawling over the floor. For both of the rivals the physical metamorphosis has severe psychological implications as well. Villain and womanizer Troy has to play a family man, while white knight Archer reluctantly has to hang out with criminal friends and followers of Troy. Archer even finds out, without Troy knowing that his nemesis has a son of his own. Although both characters are clearly not comfortable in their role  which becomes painfully clear by the laughing of the characters that evolves in pitiful cries  they both bring some of the qualities of their personality (Archers' conscience and Troy's joyful swagger) to the lives of their opponents. Still, this is all in between the over-the-top action scenes, with shootouts, set pieces and visual effects unlike any other film. Hyper stylized action scenes are a signature of John Woo, and this film is clearly no exception. Fireworks literally explode everywhere, while the hero and villain dive, roll and almost fly through the extravagant sets. In some films the action scenes can't really keep me interested because of their lack of emotional significance and originality, but this films absurd and sometimes hilarious sequencing kept me very excited. Juxtaposed against all the grotesque action scenes are the showdowns that take place on a more personal level. The encounters between the opponents throughout the film are executed very well. I found the showdown between Castor and Sean in a room full of mirrors very clever. Face/Off is very difficult film to follow. When the final "face-off" (pun inevitable) of the film draws near, it's not quite clear who is on whose side and why. Still, the film provides enough character development and motivation to keep its viewers interested in the plot. I have to say that this is maybe the action film with some of the most interesting character developments. Above all, the most enjoyable part of this film is seeing Nicolas Cage and John Travolta act like each other. Both deliver amazing performances. The script forces John Travolta to play outside of his body; including the typical Cage freak-outs and looks, while Cage's has to keep his performance more weighted; as if he is a prisoner of his own body. Still both of the actors, fortunately, get to show off their fame-making style of acting more than enough. Face/Off is a ridiculous film. With a premises that is full of gimmicks and ambiguities, action scenes that are unbelievably extravagant and a script full of cheesy lines ("It's like looking in the mirror, but only NOT"). Also it is a film made with passion and enthusiasm, screaming fun in almost every scene (some are quite sad though). This is a kind of action flick that doesn't get made in this day and age anymore. In the end Face/off also shows how Nicolas Cage can handle both his theatrical out-of-body style of acting and a more restricted and introvert role at once, therefore I think this is the perfect start for everyone interested in giving the cinema of Nicolas Cage a change.

    This movie has everything in it. From action to drama, love to hate, emotions to revenge, this has it all. Very well written and directed. But most of all the brilliance of two greats of Hollywood, Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. I would describe their performance as extreme of acting, beyond perfection. They absolutely made it an epic, how well they performed their and each other's role it's simply amazing. This movie is after 15 years is still the best in my list. I have watched it for like 50 times and every time I see it I even enjoy it more. I would highly recommend this to any action movie lover, go ahead and buy the DVD and watch it at your first chance.

    I am left with no other conclusion other than the producers of this movie went out and found any and all who in their poor taste in entertainment bought this video, or DVD. The mere notion that you can of simply removing someone's facing and surgically transplanting it onto someone else's skull to completely change their appearance is preposterous. I rented the video years ago from Blockbuster, probably not long after it hit the video store shelves. I can easily think of 5 Cage movies far better: 8 Millimeter, Lord Of War, Con Air, Match Stick Men, Thunder Birds, and Ghost Rider. I guess some people adore some actors so much no matter how poorly written the script is they will still praise the movie.

FBI agents tried to interrogate people related to Caster Troy to find out the location of the bomb. Sean Archer even threat Sasha (Gina Gershon), Troy's girlfriend, that if she will not tell the truth, he'll take away her child. Sasha's brother asked Archer about his dead son, he's convince that Troy annihilate his son. Now, Sean Archer doesn't have any choice, but to say yes to their secluded mission. Agent Hollis convinced Sean Archer to do it, since Caster Troy is a turnip and he is the only one who can deactivate the bomb and besides, this will be the only way penalize and emplace Caster Troy behind bars from killing his loving son, Michael. Sean Archer went home to see his wife and daughter Jaime before the operation, he said, "I'll be gone for a while;" and promised that it will be the last and he will definite spend more time with his family. Sean Archer wished to Dr. Walsh; to put his gun shot scar back on his chest because it reminds him of his son, and gave Tito (FBI agent), his wedding ring; they've trimmed Archer's hair and planted a microchip into his larynx to duplicate Troy's voice. Archer didn't like wearing his enemy's face, he abruptly became violent, threw hospital mirror scintillating, cussed and swear everyone and cried, and knowing the next move is to lift him to Arrow One prison. There Archer is a citizen of nowhere, wearing a pair of boots made of metal, locked down on the floor surrounded by a ground full of magnetic field so, there's no way to escape. Meanwhile, at the Walsh Institute where they kept Caster Troy, he miraculously woke up from coma; removed his bandage and felt blood on his face. He called his friend with a husky, shaking, voice and told him that someone took his face off with a help of a doctor and two FBI agents. They abduct Dr. Walsh and the other two agents behind the operation, tied them up, poured gasoline on them and burnt them alive together with the evidences that will prove Sean Archer's real personality. In the Arrow One prison, Sean Archer got a visitorit's Caster Troy wearing his face and wedding ring, laughing crazy on how their mission failed and told Sean Archer (Troy's face), "I've got a government job to abuse and a wife to f***! Isn't that amazing?" teasing and making him mad. Archer's now finding out how to escape Arrow One prison to tell his wife Eve that he's Sean Archer. Face/Off is a great, action packed movie, tons of enigmatic scenes and stunts, big actors involved, with 7.3 stars, received lots of awards, a MUST watch movie.

    This a review I wrote for my blog (cagedcinema.tumblr.com) When I started this blog I wasn't quite sure with what film I'd want to kick off my reviews of the films of Nicolas Cage. His filmography is quite vast; clocking almost 70 films (and more to come). Also, the huge differences between some of his films (in quality and in tone/genre/style) make it hard to choose a good "entry-level" film that exemplifies the qualities of Nicolas Cage. Eventually, though, my eyes lay on John Woo's Face/Off: A film that perfectly introduces the screen presence of Cage. Please bear with me with the following description of the film's plot, because it's going to be complicated. Face/Off, John Woo's (Hardboiled, Mission: Impossible II) third American film, stars John Travolta as FBI Special Agent Sean Archer, a sober and driven man who dedicated his life to take revenge on freewheeling terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), the assassin of his son. The grief for his lost son results in Archer neglecting his wife and daughter; his wife hasn't had sex in months and his daughter is full of teenage angst. Quickly though, Archer seems to get his revenge when a vehicle and action packed shootout in and around an airport hanger results in Castor Troy getting incapacitated. The villain seems to be defeated, but problems arise: Troy has planted a chemical bomb somewhere in LA. Time is ticking and the main source for information regarding the whereabouts of the bomb, Castor Troy, is in a coma. In order to save the day, Sean Archer through an unlikely construction - has to become Castor Troy now to retrieve Intel on the bomb from Troy's paranoid and incarcerated brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola). This is where the plot gets interesting. A surgeon switches Sean's face with the face of Castor and alters the other bodily features of the reluctant agent. When Archer wakes up after the procedure, he wakes up in the body of his archenemy. Thus now Nicolas Cage has to act like he is the character of John Travolta! It gets even more interesting when, after Archer (still in the body of Troy/Cage) is being brought to the prison of Troy's brother, Castor Troy wakes up from his coma without a face. He forces the same surgeon to perform the opposite transplantation: Caster Troy becomes Sean Archer, Nicolas Cage becomes John Travolta. After the operation Troy makes sure to neatly erase all the evidence of this operation (read: killing everyone involved). Now the whole film revolts on the two actors acting like they are each other. This results in some brilliant bits. For instance John Travolta (with the personality of Cage's character) making fun of his own ridiculous chin, or Nicolas Cage (with the personality of Travolta's character) taking too much drugs with the villains henchmen: bragging probably tripping on drugs for the first time "I'm going to take his face Off!" while he is crawling over the floor. For both of the rivals the physical metamorphosis has severe psychological implications as well. Villain and womanizer Troy has to play a family man, while white knight Archer reluctantly has to hang out with criminal friends and followers of Troy. Archer even finds out, without Troy knowing that his nemesis has a son of his own. Although both characters are clearly not comfortable in their role  which becomes painfully clear by the laughing of the characters that evolves in pitiful cries  they both bring some of the qualities of their personality (Archers' conscience and Troy's joyful swagger) to the lives of their opponents. Still, this is all in between the over-the-top action scenes, with shootouts, set pieces and visual effects unlike any other film. Hyper stylized action scenes are a signature of John Woo, and this film is clearly no exception. Fireworks literally explode everywhere, while the hero and villain dive, roll and almost fly through the extravagant sets. In some films the action scenes can't really keep me interested because of their lack of emotional significance and originality, but this films absurd and sometimes hilarious sequencing kept me very excited. Juxtaposed against all the grotesque action scenes are the showdowns that take place on a more personal level. The encounters between the opponents throughout the film are executed very well. I found the showdown between Castor and Sean in a room full of mirrors very clever. Face/Off is very difficult film to follow. When the final "face-off" (pun inevitable) of the film draws near, it's not quite clear who is on whose side and why. Still, the film provides enough character development and motivation to keep its viewers interested in the plot. I have to say that this is maybe the action film with some of the most interesting character developments. Above all, the most enjoyable part of this film is seeing Nicolas Cage and John Travolta act like each other. Both deliver amazing performances. The script forces John Travolta to play outside of his body; including the typical Cage freak-outs and looks, while Cage's has to keep his performance more weighted; as if he is a prisoner of his own body. Still both of the actors, fortunately, get to show off their fame-making style of acting more than enough. Face/Off is a ridiculous film. With a premises that is full of gimmicks and ambiguities, action scenes that are unbelievably extravagant and a script full of cheesy lines ("It's like looking in the mirror, but only NOT"). Also it is a film made with passion and enthusiasm, screaming fun in almost every scene (some are quite sad though). This is a kind of action flick that doesn't get made in this day and age anymore. In the end Face/off also shows how Nicolas Cage can handle both his theatrical out-of-body style of acting and a more restricted and introvert role at once, therefore I think this is the perfect start for everyone interested in giving the cinema of Nicolas Cage a change.

    This movie has everything in it. From action to drama, love to hate, emotions to revenge, this has it all. Very well written and directed. But most of all the brilliance of two greats of Hollywood, Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. I would describe their performance as extreme of acting, beyond perfection. They absolutely made it an epic, how well they performed their and each other's role it's simply amazing. This movie is after 15 years is still the best in my list. I have watched it for like 50 times and every time I see it I even enjoy it more. I would highly recommend this to any action movie lover, go ahead and buy the DVD and watch it at your first chance.

    I am left with no other conclusion other than the producers of this movie went out and found any and all who in their poor taste in entertainment bought this video, or DVD. The mere notion that you can of simply removing someone's facing and surgically transplanting it onto someone else's skull to completely change their appearance is preposterous. I rented the video years ago from Blockbuster, probably not long after it hit the video store shelves. I can easily think of 5 Cage movies far better: 8 Millimeter, Lord Of War, Con Air, Match Stick Men, Thunder Birds, and Ghost Rider. I guess some people adore some actors so much no matter how poorly written the script is they will still praise the movie.

    This is a decent film, if you are able to look past the very poor sequence in the medical centre, where the face transplants supposedly take place, and the laughable scene where the surgeon 'calibrates' Archer's voice using an implanted microchip (how is this meant to work exactly?), to make it resemble Troy's. The film reminds me a lot of "The Hot Chick", where effectively the characters have switched bodies, and this leads to interesting complications. Although unlike The Hot Chick, in Face/Off the characters are both male. The way in which each man acts to try and fit the other's personality is sometimes comical, especially the scene where Archer is carousing with Troy's cohorts and has a difficult time impersonating the other man. The contrasting lifestyles of the two men make an interesting play on their attempts to mould themselves to the other's identity.

    Action guru John Woo's big budget bangathon featuring a lot of mayhem and fun. Travolta and Cage overact their butts/off. Very entertaining. Suspension of disbelief is a tag that is attached to all Movies. Without it nothing works. These things on the screen are not really happening. The plot, concepts, portrayals are all...FICTION. So given that you are suspending your disbelief, this has to be one of the most engaging stories ever to inhabit an over the top Action Movie with unbelievable gun-play and Comic-Book characters in a setting of another place and another time. John Woo is a master of flawless explosions and pretty pandemonium. Here there is quite a touching back story of Love lost and two families living unfamiliar, opposite lives. "The eternal struggle of Good vs Evil", says the bad guy. You bet, but it is all laid out in such style and confidence that it is overwhelmingly amazing. This is an example of excellence in a Genre that is ridiculously riddled with bullets but hardly ever so quintessential. This is one that all Movies of this type could aspire. For it is one of the best and succeeds in something that most of this type fail to accomplish. It has as much heart as it does heart pounding excitement.

    John Woo's intense camera, and editing is a remarkable feat in this film. The camera is always moving, always involved, and fast paced editing make for a powerful, action-packed movie. John Travolta gratefully hams his performance, alongside the demented acting of Nicolas Cage. The two actors are rightfully having a blast in this movie, playing outsized and campy action villains and heroes. However I find the movie lacking in its vapidity and many extraneous scenes. Many of the characters are poorly acted and written, and there is little sense in the story. Despite its style and masterful execution, I still find it lacking, even as a piece of pure fluff entertainment. The movie is outrageous and entertaining, but nevertheless, pretty horrendous.

    Face/Off is the best John Woo Hollywood film by a mile. This had the budget, star power and a crazy, stupid script to carry his over the top style. It's a little long but that doesn't stop from being one of the most enjoyably stupid action films of the 90's. First off, we have two actors at their scenery chewing best - John Travolta and Nic Cage. We have great campy actors playing our main antagonist and hero. We have a crazy premise that they exploit to it's fullest potential, we have a decent story and character development sprinkled in and so on. Face/Off is more Hard Boiled and less The Killer or Better Tomorrow. Even at that, Hard Boiled is a much better action film and had a better cast. But for a Hollywood action film, Face/Off is hard to really compare it with something. And that's the best thing about it. Face/Off is a one of a kind film that only works because of the right people involved in the project. It's an over the top action extravaganza that has a story, characters and still manages to be absolutely insane.

    Everyone knows that both John Travolta and Nicolas Cage have strange acting careers  both of them starred in some great movies and both of them starred in some awful movies. Actually, nowadays it seems they act only in awful-to-average movies, which is a shame since I think both of them are talented actors. Face/Off is a 1997 action movie directed by the famous action movie director John Woo and it serves as a proof of how Cage and Travolta are really good actors. And it's also one of the better movies in both their careers. Face/Off is a story about two men  one is a cop named Sean Archer (John Travolta) and one is a crazy terrorist named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Troy has killed Archer's son several years ago and since then the two have been mortal enemies. One day Archer finally manages to capture Troy and accidentally puts him in a coma  but not before he finds out the place where Troy has put a bomb meant to explode in a couple of days. So, Archer undergoes heavy surgery and switches faces with Troy in an attempt to speak with Castor Troy's brother - Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola)  and find out where they planted the bomb. The plan backfires when Castor Troy wakes up from his coma and takes Archer's face. The two then start a dangerous game of cat and mouse. The best thing about Face/Off are the performances. Both Cage and Travolta had to play two completely different people with completely different personalities; and they were very successful in doing so. Interestingly enough both of them are better at playing the eccentric lunatic Castor Troy than in playing the part of the stoic cop Sean Archer. And if history taught us anything, it is that Nicolas Cage is absolutely amazing in playing crazy people. In the beginning of the movie, we see Cage dressed up as a priest who starts headbanging and dancing in front of a choir that is singing Hallelujah. If that's not a good enough reason to see this movie, I don't know what is. Although this is mainly a performance driven movie, the action in it is pretty decent and some action scenes were brilliantly directed. Unfortunately, other action scenes appeared to me as somewhat pretentious and overblown, mostly towards the end of the movie. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in action movies but it goes completely against the depressive tone of the rest of the movie. Face/Off is essentially a movie about identity crisis and dealing with the possibility of someone else living with your family; it doesn't need exaggerated action scenes. However, in spite of that, Face/Off is still a fun movie with wonderful performances that will leave you satisfied. It is a rather worthy collaboration of two talented actors who deserve much more out of their careers. Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    Face/Off is an outstanding movie with a breathtaking and intense storyline and magnificent performances all around.The two lead actors,John Travolta and Nicolas Cage,are amazing in this movie,they are two actors that I find very hit and miss,especially Nicolas Cage,an actor that I had never been really impressed with in the past,but I will forever respect both of these actors for their acting in this,they managed to pull off playing two different characters really well and stay through to the others personality,this didn't seem like something that would be easy to do,but Travolta and Cage pulled it off perfectly.I didn't see anything not to like about this movie and I don't know how it's not on the IMDb Top 250,it is a must see for fans of action and crime movies. Sean Archer (John Travolta) must stop a bomb set up by Caston Troy (Nicolas Cage),a terrorist who killed his son,by switching faces with him by a surgical operation,but he is put into prison and Caston disguised as Sean destroys every piece of evidence that they switched faces,so Sean must find a way to escape and prove who he really is.

    Hey, guys! This is not a chick-flick movie and for sure you're not going to say, "It's lame, so boring!" Face/off is a hardcore, breath-taking; action, crime, thriller movie directed by John Woo in 1997. John Woo is known for Mission Impossible II with Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. I love this movie; it's one of Nicolas Cage's movies I've ever watched aside from Con Air. This movie is all about this tough federal bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent, Sean Archer (John Travolta), who has been chasing to seize Caster Troy (Nicolas cage), the terrorist who has no conscience, mastermind behind bombings, assassinations, murder, kidnapping and the most dangerous and most brilliant criminal. John Travolta and his team found a way to capture Caster Troy (Nicolas Cage) through this black bag operation, but nobody should ever know about this suicidal operation, not even Sean Archer's wife, Dr. Eve Archer (Joan Allen). It's a plastic surgery procedure at Walsh Institute supervised by Dr. Walsh. The procedure will remove and switch each other's face. Meaning John Travolta will be Nicolas Cage and vice versa. Nicolas Cage planted a bomb at the L.A. Convention that only he and his brother Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola), know and the government is trying to figure out where this bomb is at. Meanwhile, after Caster Troy and his brother's police encounter at the private plane port, a plane's exhaust running hot, hit Caster Troy's body towards a huge screen vents which made him suffer comatose, but they caught Pollux Troy. FBI agents tried to interrogate people related to Caster Troy to find out the location of the bomb. Sean Archer even threat Sasha (Gina Gershon), Troy's girlfriend, that if she will not tell the truth, he'll take away her child. Sasha's brother asked Archer about his dead son, he's convince that Troy annihilate his son. Now, Sean Archer doesn't have any choice, but to say yes to their secluded mission. Agent Hollis convinced Sean Archer to do it, since Caster Troy is a turnip and he is the only one who can deactivate the bomb and besides, this will be the only way penalize and emplace Caster Troy behind bars from killing his loving son, Michael. Sean Archer went home to see his wife and daughter Jaime before the operation, he said, "I'll be gone for a while;" and promised that it will be the last and he will definite spend more time with his family. Sean Archer wished to Dr. Walsh; to put his gun shot scar back on his chest because it reminds him of his son, and gave Tito (FBI agent), his wedding ring; they've trimmed Archer's hair and planted a microchip into his larynx to duplicate Troy's voice. Archer didn't like wearing his enemy's face, he abruptly became violent, threw hospital mirror scintillating, cussed and swear everyone and cried, and knowing the next move is to lift him to Arrow One prison. There Archer is a citizen of nowhere, wearing a pair of boots made of metal, locked down on the floor surrounded by a ground full of magnetic field so, there's no way to escape. Meanwhile, at the Walsh Institute where they kept Caster Troy, he miraculously woke up from coma; removed his bandage and felt blood on his face. He called his friend with a husky, shaking, voice and told him that someone took his face off with a help of a doctor and two FBI agents. They abduct Dr. Walsh and the other two agents behind the operation, tied them up, poured gasoline on them and burnt them alive together with the evidences that will prove Sean Archer's real personality. In the Arrow One prison, Sean Archer got a visitorit's Caster Troy wearing his face and wedding ring, laughing crazy on how their mission failed and told Sean Archer (Troy's face), "I've got a government job to abuse and a wife to f***! Isn't that amazing?" teasing and making him mad. Archer's now finding out how to escape Arrow One prison to tell his wife Eve that he's Sean Archer. Face/Off is a great, action packed movie, tons of enigmatic scenes and stunts, big actors involved, with 7.3 stars, received lots of awards, a MUST watch movie.

    This is a decent film, if you are able to look past the very poor sequence in the medical centre, where the face transplants supposedly take place, and the laughable scene where the surgeon 'calibrates' Archer's voice using an implanted microchip (how is this meant to work exactly?), to make it resemble Troy's. The film reminds me a lot of "The Hot Chick", where effectively the characters have switched bodies, and this leads to interesting complications. Although unlike The Hot Chick, in Face/Off the characters are both male. The way in which each man acts to try and fit the other's personality is sometimes comical, especially the scene where Archer is carousing with Troy's cohorts and has a difficult time impersonating the other man. The contrasting lifestyles of the two men make an interesting play on their attempts to mould themselves to the other's identity.

    Action guru John Woo's big budget bangathon featuring a lot of mayhem and fun. Travolta and Cage overact their butts/off. Very entertaining. Suspension of disbelief is a tag that is attached to all Movies. Without it nothing works. These things on the screen are not really happening. The plot, concepts, portrayals are all...FICTION. So given that you are suspending your disbelief, this has to be one of the most engaging stories ever to inhabit an over the top Action Movie with unbelievable gun-play and Comic-Book characters in a setting of another place and another time. John Woo is a master of flawless explosions and pretty pandemonium. Here there is quite a touching back story of Love lost and two families living unfamiliar, opposite lives. "The eternal struggle of Good vs Evil", says the bad guy. You bet, but it is all laid out in such style and confidence that it is overwhelmingly amazing. This is an example of excellence in a Genre that is ridiculously riddled with bullets but hardly ever so quintessential. This is one that all Movies of this type could aspire. For it is one of the best and succeeds in something that most of this type fail to accomplish. It has as much heart as it does heart pounding excitement.

    John Woo's intense camera, and editing is a remarkable feat in this film. The camera is always moving, always involved, and fast paced editing make for a powerful, action-packed movie. John Travolta gratefully hams his performance, alongside the demented acting of Nicolas Cage. The two actors are rightfully having a blast in this movie, playing outsized and campy action villains and heroes. However I find the movie lacking in its vapidity and many extraneous scenes. Many of the characters are poorly acted and written, and there is little sense in the story. Despite its style and masterful execution, I still find it lacking, even as a piece of pure fluff entertainment. The movie is outrageous and entertaining, but nevertheless, pretty horrendous.

    Face/Off is the best John Woo Hollywood film by a mile. This had the budget, star power and a crazy, stupid script to carry his over the top style. It's a little long but that doesn't stop from being one of the most enjoyably stupid action films of the 90's. First off, we have two actors at their scenery chewing best - John Travolta and Nic Cage. We have great campy actors playing our main antagonist and hero. We have a crazy premise that they exploit to it's fullest potential, we have a decent story and character development sprinkled in and so on. Face/Off is more Hard Boiled and less The Killer or Better Tomorrow. Even at that, Hard Boiled is a much better action film and had a better cast. But for a Hollywood action film, Face/Off is hard to really compare it with something. And that's the best thing about it. Face/Off is a one of a kind film that only works because of the right people involved in the project. It's an over the top action extravaganza that has a story, characters and still manages to be absolutely insane.

    Everyone knows that both John Travolta and Nicolas Cage have strange acting careers  both of them starred in some great movies and both of them starred in some awful movies. Actually, nowadays it seems they act only in awful-to-average movies, which is a shame since I think both of them are talented actors. Face/Off is a 1997 action movie directed by the famous action movie director John Woo and it serves as a proof of how Cage and Travolta are really good actors. And it's also one of the better movies in both their careers. Face/Off is a story about two men  one is a cop named Sean Archer (John Travolta) and one is a crazy terrorist named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Troy has killed Archer's son several years ago and since then the two have been mortal enemies. One day Archer finally manages to capture Troy and accidentally puts him in a coma  but not before he finds out the place where Troy has put a bomb meant to explode in a couple of days. So, Archer undergoes heavy surgery and switches faces with Troy in an attempt to speak with Castor Troy's brother - Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola)  and find out where they planted the bomb. The plan backfires when Castor Troy wakes up from his coma and takes Archer's face. The two then start a dangerous game of cat and mouse. The best thing about Face/Off are the performances. Both Cage and Travolta had to play two completely different people with completely different personalities; and they were very successful in doing so. Interestingly enough both of them are better at playing the eccentric lunatic Castor Troy than in playing the part of the stoic cop Sean Archer. And if history taught us anything, it is that Nicolas Cage is absolutely amazing in playing crazy people. In the beginning of the movie, we see Cage dressed up as a priest who starts headbanging and dancing in front of a choir that is singing Hallelujah. If that's not a good enough reason to see this movie, I don't know what is. Although this is mainly a performance driven movie, the action in it is pretty decent and some action scenes were brilliantly directed. Unfortunately, other action scenes appeared to me as somewhat pretentious and overblown, mostly towards the end of the movie. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in action movies but it goes completely against the depressive tone of the rest of the movie. Face/Off is essentially a movie about identity crisis and dealing with the possibility of someone else living with your family; it doesn't need exaggerated action scenes. However, in spite of that, Face/Off is still a fun movie with wonderful performances that will leave you satisfied. It is a rather worthy collaboration of two talented actors who deserve much more out of their careers. Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    Face/Off is an outstanding movie with a breathtaking and intense storyline and magnificent performances all around.The two lead actors,John Travolta and Nicolas Cage,are amazing in this movie,they are two actors that I find very hit and miss,especially Nicolas Cage,an actor that I had never been really impressed with in the past,but I will forever respect both of these actors for their acting in this,they managed to pull off playing two different characters really well and stay through to the others personality,this didn't seem like something that would be easy to do,but Travolta and Cage pulled it off perfectly.I didn't see anything not to like about this movie and I don't know how it's not on the IMDb Top 250,it is a must see for fans of action and crime movies. Sean Archer (John Travolta) must stop a bomb set up by Caston Troy (Nicolas Cage),a terrorist who killed his son,by switching faces with him by a surgical operation,but he is put into prison and Caston disguised as Sean destroys every piece of evidence that they switched faces,so Sean must find a way to escape and prove who he really is.

    Hey, guys! This is not a chick-flick movie and for sure you're not going to say, "It's lame, so boring!" Face/off is a hardcore, breath-taking; action, crime, thriller movie directed by John Woo in 1997. John Woo is known for Mission Impossible II with Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. I love this movie; it's one of Nicolas Cage's movies I've ever watched aside from Con Air. This movie is all about this tough federal bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent, Sean Archer (John Travolta), who has been chasing to seize Caster Troy (Nicolas cage), the terrorist who has no conscience, mastermind behind bombings, assassinations, murder, kidnapping and the most dangerous and most brilliant criminal. John Travolta and his team found a way to capture Caster Troy (Nicolas Cage) through this black bag operation, but nobody should ever know about this suicidal operation, not even Sean Archer's wife, Dr. Eve Archer (Joan Allen). It's a plastic surgery procedure at Walsh Institute supervised by Dr. Walsh. The procedure will remove and switch each other's face. Meaning John Travolta will be Nicolas Cage and vice versa. Nicolas Cage planted a bomb at the L.A. Convention that only he and his brother Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola), know and the government is trying to figure out where this bomb is at. Meanwhile, after Caster Troy and his brother's police encounter at the private plane port, a plane's exhaust running hot, hit Caster Troy's body towards a huge screen vents which made him suffer comatose, but they caught Pollux Troy. FBI agents tried to interrogate people related to Caster Troy to find out the location of the bomb. Sean Archer even threat Sasha (Gina Gershon), Troy's girlfriend, that if she will not tell the truth, he'll take away her child. Sasha's brother asked Archer about his dead son, he's convince that Troy annihilate his son. Now, Sean Archer doesn't have any choice, but to say yes to their secluded mission. Agent Hollis convinced Sean Archer to do it, since Caster Troy is a turnip and he is the only one who can deactivate the bomb and besides, this will be the only way penalize and emplace Caster Troy behind bars from killing his loving son, Michael. Sean Archer went home to see his wife and daughter Jaime before the operation, he said, "I'll be gone for a while;" and promised that it will be the last and he will definite spend more time with his family. Sean Archer wished to Dr. Walsh; to put his gun shot scar back on his chest because it reminds him of his son, and gave Tito (FBI agent), his wedding ring; they've trimmed Archer's hair and planted a microchip into his larynx to duplicate Troy's voice. Archer didn't like wearing his enemy's face, he abruptly became violent, threw hospital mirror scintillating, cussed and swear everyone and cried, and knowing the next move is to lift him to Arrow One prison. There Archer is a citizen of nowhere, wearing a pair of boots made of metal, locked down on the floor surrounded by a ground full of magnetic field so, there's no way to escape. Meanwhile, at the Walsh Institute where they kept Caster Troy, he miraculously woke up from coma; removed his bandage and felt blood on his face. He called his friend with a husky, shaking, voice and told him that someone took his face off with a help of a doctor and two FBI agents. They abduct Dr. Walsh and the other two agents behind the operation, tied them up, poured gasoline on them and burnt them alive together with the evidences that will prove Sean Archer's real personality. In the Arrow One prison, Sean Archer got a visitorit's Caster Troy wearing his face and wedding ring, laughing crazy on how their mission failed and told Sean Archer (Troy's face), "I've got a government job to abuse and a wife to f***! Isn't that amazing?" teasing and making him mad. Archer's now finding out how to escape Arrow One prison to tell his wife Eve that he's Sean Archer. Face/Off is a great, action packed movie, tons of enigmatic scenes and stunts, big actors involved, with 7.3 stars, received lots of awards, a MUST watch movie.

    This a review I wrote for my blog (cagedcinema.tumblr.com) When I started this blog I wasn't quite sure with what film I'd want to kick off my reviews of the films of Nicolas Cage. His filmography is quite vast; clocking almost 70 films (and more to come). Also, the huge differences between some of his films (in quality and in tone/genre/style) make it hard to choose a good "entry-level" film that exemplifies the qualities of Nicolas Cage. Eventually, though, my eyes lay on John Woo's Face/Off: A film that perfectly introduces the screen presence of Cage. Please bear with me with the following description of the film's plot, because it's going to be complicated. Face/Off, John Woo's (Hardboiled, Mission: Impossible II) third American film, stars John Travolta as FBI Special Agent Sean Archer, a sober and driven man who dedicated his life to take revenge on freewheeling terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), the assassin of his son. The grief for his lost son results in Archer neglecting his wife and daughter; his wife hasn't had sex in months and his daughter is full of teenage angst. Quickly though, Archer seems to get his revenge when a vehicle and action packed shootout in and around an airport hanger results in Castor Troy getting incapacitated. The villain seems to be defeated, but problems arise: Troy has planted a chemical bomb somewhere in LA. Time is ticking and the main source for information regarding the whereabouts of the bomb, Castor Troy, is in a coma. In order to save the day, Sean Archer through an unlikely construction - has to become Castor Troy now to retrieve Intel on the bomb from Troy's paranoid and incarcerated brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola). This is where the plot gets interesting. A surgeon switches Sean's face with the face of Castor and alters the other bodily features of the reluctant agent. When Archer wakes up after the procedure, he wakes up in the body of his archenemy. Thus now Nicolas Cage has to act like he is the character of John Travolta! It gets even more interesting when, after Archer (still in the body of Troy/Cage) is being brought to the prison of Troy's brother, Castor Troy wakes up from his coma without a face. He forces the same surgeon to perform the opposite transplantation: Caster Troy becomes Sean Archer, Nicolas Cage becomes John Travolta. After the operation Troy makes sure to neatly erase all the evidence of this operation (read: killing everyone involved). Now the whole film revolts on the two actors acting like they are each other. This results in some brilliant bits. For instance John Travolta (with the personality of Cage's character) making fun of his own ridiculous chin, or Nicolas Cage (with the personality of Travolta's character) taking too much drugs with the villains henchmen: bragging probably tripping on drugs for the first time "I'm going to take his face Off!" while he is crawling over the floor. For both of the rivals the physical metamorphosis has severe psychological implications as well. Villain and womanizer Troy has to play a family man, while white knight Archer reluctantly has to hang out with criminal friends and followers of Troy. Archer even finds out, without Troy knowing that his nemesis has a son of his own. Although both characters are clearly not comfortable in their role  which becomes painfully clear by the laughing of the characters that evolves in pitiful cries  they both bring some of the qualities of their personality (Archers' conscience and Troy's joyful swagger) to the lives of their opponents. Still, this is all in between the over-the-top action scenes, with shootouts, set pieces and visual effects unlike any other film. Hyper stylized action scenes are a signature of John Woo, and this film is clearly no exception. Fireworks literally explode everywhere, while the hero and villain dive, roll and almost fly through the extravagant sets. In some films the action scenes can't really keep me interested because of their lack of emotional significance and originality, but this films absurd and sometimes hilarious sequencing kept me very excited. Juxtaposed against all the grotesque action scenes are the showdowns that take place on a more personal level. The encounters between the opponents throughout the film are executed very well. I found the showdown between Castor and Sean in a room full of mirrors very clever. Face/Off is very difficult film to follow. When the final "face-off" (pun inevitable) of the film draws near, it's not quite clear who is on whose side and why. Still, the film provides enough character development and motivation to keep its viewers interested in the plot. I have to say that this is maybe the action film with some of the most interesting character developments. Above all, the most enjoyable part of this film is seeing Nicolas Cage and John Travolta act like each other. Both deliver amazing performances. The script forces John Travolta to play outside of his body; including the typical Cage freak-outs and looks, while Cage's has to keep his performance more weighted; as if he is a prisoner of his own body. Still both of the actors, fortunately, get to show off their fame-making style of acting more than enough. Face/Off is a ridiculous film. With a premises that is full of gimmicks and ambiguities, action scenes that are unbelievably extravagant and a script full of cheesy lines ("It's like looking in the mirror, but only NOT"). Also it is a film made with passion and enthusiasm, screaming fun in almost every scene (some are quite sad though). This is a kind of action flick that doesn't get made in this day and age anymore. In the end Face/off also shows how Nicolas Cage can handle both his theatrical out-of-body style of acting and a more restricted and introvert role at once, therefore I think this is the perfect start for everyone interested in giving the cinema of Nicolas Cage a change.

    This movie has everything in it. From action to drama, love to hate, emotions to revenge, this has it all. Very well written and directed. But most of all the brilliance of two greats of Hollywood, Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. I would describe their performance as extreme of acting, beyond perfection. They absolutely made it an epic, how well they performed their and each other's role it's simply amazing. This movie is after 15 years is still the best in my list. I have watched it for like 50 times and every time I see it I even enjoy it more. I would highly recommend this to any action movie lover, go ahead and buy the DVD and watch it at your first chance.

    I am left with no other conclusion other than the producers of this movie went out and found any and all who in their poor taste in entertainment bought this video, or DVD. The mere notion that you can of simply removing someone's facing and surgically transplanting it onto someone else's skull to completely change their appearance is preposterous. I rented the video years ago from Blockbuster, probably not long after it hit the video store shelves. I can easily think of 5 Cage movies far better: 8 Millimeter, Lord Of War, Con Air, Match Stick Men, Thunder Birds, and Ghost Rider. I guess some people adore some actors so much no matter how poorly written the script is they will still praise the movie.

Meanwhile, after Caster Troy and his brother's police encounter at the private plane port, a plane's exhaust running hot, hit Caster Troy's body towards a huge screen vents which made him suffer comatose, but they caught Pollux Troy. FBI agents tried to interrogate people related to Caster Troy to find out the location of the bomb. Sean Archer even threat Sasha (Gina Gershon), Troy's girlfriend, that if she will not tell the truth, he'll take away her child. Sasha's brother asked Archer about his dead son, he's convince that Troy annihilate his son. Now, Sean Archer doesn't have any choice, but to say yes to their secluded mission. Agent Hollis convinced Sean Archer to do it, since Caster Troy is a turnip and he is the only one who can deactivate the bomb and besides, this will be the only way penalize and emplace Caster Troy behind bars from killing his loving son, Michael. Sean Archer went home to see his wife and daughter Jaime before the operation, he said, "I'll be gone for a while;" and promised that it will be the last and he will definite spend more time with his family. Sean Archer wished to Dr. Walsh; to put his gun shot scar back on his chest because it reminds him of his son, and gave Tito (FBI agent), his wedding ring; they've trimmed Archer's hair and planted a microchip into his larynx to duplicate Troy's voice. Archer didn't like wearing his enemy's face, he abruptly became violent, threw hospital mirror scintillating, cussed and swear everyone and cried, and knowing the next move is to lift him to Arrow One prison. There Archer is a citizen of nowhere, wearing a pair of boots made of metal, locked down on the floor surrounded by a ground full of magnetic field so, there's no way to escape. Meanwhile, at the Walsh Institute where they kept Caster Troy, he miraculously woke up from coma; removed his bandage and felt blood on his face. He called his friend with a husky, shaking, voice and told him that someone took his face off with a help of a doctor and two FBI agents. They abduct Dr. Walsh and the other two agents behind the operation, tied them up, poured gasoline on them and burnt them alive together with the evidences that will prove Sean Archer's real personality. In the Arrow One prison, Sean Archer got a visitorit's Caster Troy wearing his face and wedding ring, laughing crazy on how their mission failed and told Sean Archer (Troy's face), "I've got a government job to abuse and a wife to f***! Isn't that amazing?" teasing and making him mad. Archer's now finding out how to escape Arrow One prison to tell his wife Eve that he's Sean Archer. Face/Off is a great, action packed movie, tons of enigmatic scenes and stunts, big actors involved, with 7.3 stars, received lots of awards, a MUST watch movie.

    This a review I wrote for my blog (cagedcinema.tumblr.com) When I started this blog I wasn't quite sure with what film I'd want to kick off my reviews of the films of Nicolas Cage. His filmography is quite vast; clocking almost 70 films (and more to come). Also, the huge differences between some of his films (in quality and in tone/genre/style) make it hard to choose a good "entry-level" film that exemplifies the qualities of Nicolas Cage. Eventually, though, my eyes lay on John Woo's Face/Off: A film that perfectly introduces the screen presence of Cage. Please bear with me with the following description of the film's plot, because it's going to be complicated. Face/Off, John Woo's (Hardboiled, Mission: Impossible II) third American film, stars John Travolta as FBI Special Agent Sean Archer, a sober and driven man who dedicated his life to take revenge on freewheeling terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), the assassin of his son. The grief for his lost son results in Archer neglecting his wife and daughter; his wife hasn't had sex in months and his daughter is full of teenage angst. Quickly though, Archer seems to get his revenge when a vehicle and action packed shootout in and around an airport hanger results in Castor Troy getting incapacitated. The villain seems to be defeated, but problems arise: Troy has planted a chemical bomb somewhere in LA. Time is ticking and the main source for information regarding the whereabouts of the bomb, Castor Troy, is in a coma. In order to save the day, Sean Archer through an unlikely construction - has to become Castor Troy now to retrieve Intel on the bomb from Troy's paranoid and incarcerated brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola). This is where the plot gets interesting. A surgeon switches Sean's face with the face of Castor and alters the other bodily features of the reluctant agent. When Archer wakes up after the procedure, he wakes up in the body of his archenemy. Thus now Nicolas Cage has to act like he is the character of John Travolta! It gets even more interesting when, after Archer (still in the body of Troy/Cage) is being brought to the prison of Troy's brother, Castor Troy wakes up from his coma without a face. He forces the same surgeon to perform the opposite transplantation: Caster Troy becomes Sean Archer, Nicolas Cage becomes John Travolta. After the operation Troy makes sure to neatly erase all the evidence of this operation (read: killing everyone involved). Now the whole film revolts on the two actors acting like they are each other. This results in some brilliant bits. For instance John Travolta (with the personality of Cage's character) making fun of his own ridiculous chin, or Nicolas Cage (with the personality of Travolta's character) taking too much drugs with the villains henchmen: bragging probably tripping on drugs for the first time "I'm going to take his face Off!" while he is crawling over the floor. For both of the rivals the physical metamorphosis has severe psychological implications as well. Villain and womanizer Troy has to play a family man, while white knight Archer reluctantly has to hang out with criminal friends and followers of Troy. Archer even finds out, without Troy knowing that his nemesis has a son of his own. Although both characters are clearly not comfortable in their role  which becomes painfully clear by the laughing of the characters that evolves in pitiful cries  they both bring some of the qualities of their personality (Archers' conscience and Troy's joyful swagger) to the lives of their opponents. Still, this is all in between the over-the-top action scenes, with shootouts, set pieces and visual effects unlike any other film. Hyper stylized action scenes are a signature of John Woo, and this film is clearly no exception. Fireworks literally explode everywhere, while the hero and villain dive, roll and almost fly through the extravagant sets. In some films the action scenes can't really keep me interested because of their lack of emotional significance and originality, but this films absurd and sometimes hilarious sequencing kept me very excited. Juxtaposed against all the grotesque action scenes are the showdowns that take place on a more personal level. The encounters between the opponents throughout the film are executed very well. I found the showdown between Castor and Sean in a room full of mirrors very clever. Face/Off is very difficult film to follow. When the final "face-off" (pun inevitable) of the film draws near, it's not quite clear who is on whose side and why. Still, the film provides enough character development and motivation to keep its viewers interested in the plot. I have to say that this is maybe the action film with some of the most interesting character developments. Above all, the most enjoyable part of this film is seeing Nicolas Cage and John Travolta act like each other. Both deliver amazing performances. The script forces John Travolta to play outside of his body; including the typical Cage freak-outs and looks, while Cage's has to keep his performance more weighted; as if he is a prisoner of his own body. Still both of the actors, fortunately, get to show off their fame-making style of acting more than enough. Face/Off is a ridiculous film. With a premises that is full of gimmicks and ambiguities, action scenes that are unbelievably extravagant and a script full of cheesy lines ("It's like looking in the mirror, but only NOT"). Also it is a film made with passion and enthusiasm, screaming fun in almost every scene (some are quite sad though). This is a kind of action flick that doesn't get made in this day and age anymore. In the end Face/off also shows how Nicolas Cage can handle both his theatrical out-of-body style of acting and a more restricted and introvert role at once, therefore I think this is the perfect start for everyone interested in giving the cinema of Nicolas Cage a change.

    This movie has everything in it. From action to drama, love to hate, emotions to revenge, this has it all. Very well written and directed. But most of all the brilliance of two greats of Hollywood, Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. I would describe their performance as extreme of acting, beyond perfection. They absolutely made it an epic, how well they performed their and each other's role it's simply amazing. This movie is after 15 years is still the best in my list. I have watched it for like 50 times and every time I see it I even enjoy it more. I would highly recommend this to any action movie lover, go ahead and buy the DVD and watch it at your first chance.

    I am left with no other conclusion other than the producers of this movie went out and found any and all who in their poor taste in entertainment bought this video, or DVD. The mere notion that you can of simply removing someone's facing and surgically transplanting it onto someone else's skull to completely change their appearance is preposterous. I rented the video years ago from Blockbuster, probably not long after it hit the video store shelves. I can easily think of 5 Cage movies far better: 8 Millimeter, Lord Of War, Con Air, Match Stick Men, Thunder Birds, and Ghost Rider. I guess some people adore some actors so much no matter how poorly written the script is they will still praise the movie.

    This is a decent film, if you are able to look past the very poor sequence in the medical centre, where the face transplants supposedly take place, and the laughable scene where the surgeon 'calibrates' Archer's voice using an implanted microchip (how is this meant to work exactly?), to make it resemble Troy's. The film reminds me a lot of "The Hot Chick", where effectively the characters have switched bodies, and this leads to interesting complications. Although unlike The Hot Chick, in Face/Off the characters are both male. The way in which each man acts to try and fit the other's personality is sometimes comical, especially the scene where Archer is carousing with Troy's cohorts and has a difficult time impersonating the other man. The contrasting lifestyles of the two men make an interesting play on their attempts to mould themselves to the other's identity.

    Action guru John Woo's big budget bangathon featuring a lot of mayhem and fun. Travolta and Cage overact their butts/off. Very entertaining. Suspension of disbelief is a tag that is attached to all Movies. Without it nothing works. These things on the screen are not really happening. The plot, concepts, portrayals are all...FICTION. So given that you are suspending your disbelief, this has to be one of the most engaging stories ever to inhabit an over the top Action Movie with unbelievable gun-play and Comic-Book characters in a setting of another place and another time. John Woo is a master of flawless explosions and pretty pandemonium. Here there is quite a touching back story of Love lost and two families living unfamiliar, opposite lives. "The eternal struggle of Good vs Evil", says the bad guy. You bet, but it is all laid out in such style and confidence that it is overwhelmingly amazing. This is an example of excellence in a Genre that is ridiculously riddled with bullets but hardly ever so quintessential. This is one that all Movies of this type could aspire. For it is one of the best and succeeds in something that most of this type fail to accomplish. It has as much heart as it does heart pounding excitement.

    John Woo's intense camera, and editing is a remarkable feat in this film. The camera is always moving, always involved, and fast paced editing make for a powerful, action-packed movie. John Travolta gratefully hams his performance, alongside the demented acting of Nicolas Cage. The two actors are rightfully having a blast in this movie, playing outsized and campy action villains and heroes. However I find the movie lacking in its vapidity and many extraneous scenes. Many of the characters are poorly acted and written, and there is little sense in the story. Despite its style and masterful execution, I still find it lacking, even as a piece of pure fluff entertainment. The movie is outrageous and entertaining, but nevertheless, pretty horrendous.

    Face/Off is the best John Woo Hollywood film by a mile. This had the budget, star power and a crazy, stupid script to carry his over the top style. It's a little long but that doesn't stop from being one of the most enjoyably stupid action films of the 90's. First off, we have two actors at their scenery chewing best - John Travolta and Nic Cage. We have great campy actors playing our main antagonist and hero. We have a crazy premise that they exploit to it's fullest potential, we have a decent story and character development sprinkled in and so on. Face/Off is more Hard Boiled and less The Killer or Better Tomorrow. Even at that, Hard Boiled is a much better action film and had a better cast. But for a Hollywood action film, Face/Off is hard to really compare it with something. And that's the best thing about it. Face/Off is a one of a kind film that only works because of the right people involved in the project. It's an over the top action extravaganza that has a story, characters and still manages to be absolutely insane.

    Everyone knows that both John Travolta and Nicolas Cage have strange acting careers  both of them starred in some great movies and both of them starred in some awful movies. Actually, nowadays it seems they act only in awful-to-average movies, which is a shame since I think both of them are talented actors. Face/Off is a 1997 action movie directed by the famous action movie director John Woo and it serves as a proof of how Cage and Travolta are really good actors. And it's also one of the better movies in both their careers. Face/Off is a story about two men  one is a cop named Sean Archer (John Travolta) and one is a crazy terrorist named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Troy has killed Archer's son several years ago and since then the two have been mortal enemies. One day Archer finally manages to capture Troy and accidentally puts him in a coma  but not before he finds out the place where Troy has put a bomb meant to explode in a couple of days. So, Archer undergoes heavy surgery and switches faces with Troy in an attempt to speak with Castor Troy's brother - Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola)  and find out where they planted the bomb. The plan backfires when Castor Troy wakes up from his coma and takes Archer's face. The two then start a dangerous game of cat and mouse. The best thing about Face/Off are the performances. Both Cage and Travolta had to play two completely different people with completely different personalities; and they were very successful in doing so. Interestingly enough both of them are better at playing the eccentric lunatic Castor Troy than in playing the part of the stoic cop Sean Archer. And if history taught us anything, it is that Nicolas Cage is absolutely amazing in playing crazy people. In the beginning of the movie, we see Cage dressed up as a priest who starts headbanging and dancing in front of a choir that is singing Hallelujah. If that's not a good enough reason to see this movie, I don't know what is. Although this is mainly a performance driven movie, the action in it is pretty decent and some action scenes were brilliantly directed. Unfortunately, other action scenes appeared to me as somewhat pretentious and overblown, mostly towards the end of the movie. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in action movies but it goes completely against the depressive tone of the rest of the movie. Face/Off is essentially a movie about identity crisis and dealing with the possibility of someone else living with your family; it doesn't need exaggerated action scenes. However, in spite of that, Face/Off is still a fun movie with wonderful performances that will leave you satisfied. It is a rather worthy collaboration of two talented actors who deserve much more out of their careers. Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    Face/Off is an outstanding movie with a breathtaking and intense storyline and magnificent performances all around.The two lead actors,John Travolta and Nicolas Cage,are amazing in this movie,they are two actors that I find very hit and miss,especially Nicolas Cage,an actor that I had never been really impressed with in the past,but I will forever respect both of these actors for their acting in this,they managed to pull off playing two different characters really well and stay through to the others personality,this didn't seem like something that would be easy to do,but Travolta and Cage pulled it off perfectly.I didn't see anything not to like about this movie and I don't know how it's not on the IMDb Top 250,it is a must see for fans of action and crime movies. Sean Archer (John Travolta) must stop a bomb set up by Caston Troy (Nicolas Cage),a terrorist who killed his son,by switching faces with him by a surgical operation,but he is put into prison and Caston disguised as Sean destroys every piece of evidence that they switched faces,so Sean must find a way to escape and prove who he really is.

    Hey, guys! This is not a chick-flick movie and for sure you're not going to say, "It's lame, so boring!" Face/off is a hardcore, breath-taking; action, crime, thriller movie directed by John Woo in 1997. John Woo is known for Mission Impossible II with Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. I love this movie; it's one of Nicolas Cage's movies I've ever watched aside from Con Air. This movie is all about this tough federal bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent, Sean Archer (John Travolta), who has been chasing to seize Caster Troy (Nicolas cage), the terrorist who has no conscience, mastermind behind bombings, assassinations, murder, kidnapping and the most dangerous and most brilliant criminal. John Travolta and his team found a way to capture Caster Troy (Nicolas Cage) through this black bag operation, but nobody should ever know about this suicidal operation, not even Sean Archer's wife, Dr. Eve Archer (Joan Allen). It's a plastic surgery procedure at Walsh Institute supervised by Dr. Walsh. The procedure will remove and switch each other's face. Meaning John Travolta will be Nicolas Cage and vice versa. Nicolas Cage planted a bomb at the L.A. Convention that only he and his brother Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola), know and the government is trying to figure out where this bomb is at. Meanwhile, after Caster Troy and his brother's police encounter at the private plane port, a plane's exhaust running hot, hit Caster Troy's body towards a huge screen vents which made him suffer comatose, but they caught Pollux Troy. FBI agents tried to interrogate people related to Caster Troy to find out the location of the bomb. Sean Archer even threat Sasha (Gina Gershon), Troy's girlfriend, that if she will not tell the truth, he'll take away her child. Sasha's brother asked Archer about his dead son, he's convince that Troy annihilate his son. Now, Sean Archer doesn't have any choice, but to say yes to their secluded mission. Agent Hollis convinced Sean Archer to do it, since Caster Troy is a turnip and he is the only one who can deactivate the bomb and besides, this will be the only way penalize and emplace Caster Troy behind bars from killing his loving son, Michael. Sean Archer went home to see his wife and daughter Jaime before the operation, he said, "I'll be gone for a while;" and promised that it will be the last and he will definite spend more time with his family. Sean Archer wished to Dr. Walsh; to put his gun shot scar back on his chest because it reminds him of his son, and gave Tito (FBI agent), his wedding ring; they've trimmed Archer's hair and planted a microchip into his larynx to duplicate Troy's voice. Archer didn't like wearing his enemy's face, he abruptly became violent, threw hospital mirror scintillating, cussed and swear everyone and cried, and knowing the next move is to lift him to Arrow One prison. There Archer is a citizen of nowhere, wearing a pair of boots made of metal, locked down on the floor surrounded by a ground full of magnetic field so, there's no way to escape. Meanwhile, at the Walsh Institute where they kept Caster Troy, he miraculously woke up from coma; removed his bandage and felt blood on his face. He called his friend with a husky, shaking, voice and told him that someone took his face off with a help of a doctor and two FBI agents. They abduct Dr. Walsh and the other two agents behind the operation, tied them up, poured gasoline on them and burnt them alive together with the evidences that will prove Sean Archer's real personality. In the Arrow One prison, Sean Archer got a visitorit's Caster Troy wearing his face and wedding ring, laughing crazy on how their mission failed and told Sean Archer (Troy's face), "I've got a government job to abuse and a wife to f***! Isn't that amazing?" teasing and making him mad. Archer's now finding out how to escape Arrow One prison to tell his wife Eve that he's Sean Archer. Face/Off is a great, action packed movie, tons of enigmatic scenes and stunts, big actors involved, with 7.3 stars, received lots of awards, a MUST watch movie.

    This is a decent film, if you are able to look past the very poor sequence in the medical centre, where the face transplants supposedly take place, and the laughable scene where the surgeon 'calibrates' Archer's voice using an implanted microchip (how is this meant to work exactly?), to make it resemble Troy's. The film reminds me a lot of "The Hot Chick", where effectively the characters have switched bodies, and this leads to interesting complications. Although unlike The Hot Chick, in Face/Off the characters are both male. The way in which each man acts to try and fit the other's personality is sometimes comical, especially the scene where Archer is carousing with Troy's cohorts and has a difficult time impersonating the other man. The contrasting lifestyles of the two men make an interesting play on their attempts to mould themselves to the other's identity.

    Action guru John Woo's big budget bangathon featuring a lot of mayhem and fun. Travolta and Cage overact their butts/off. Very entertaining. Suspension of disbelief is a tag that is attached to all Movies. Without it nothing works. These things on the screen are not really happening. The plot, concepts, portrayals are all...FICTION. So given that you are suspending your disbelief, this has to be one of the most engaging stories ever to inhabit an over the top Action Movie with unbelievable gun-play and Comic-Book characters in a setting of another place and another time. John Woo is a master of flawless explosions and pretty pandemonium. Here there is quite a touching back story of Love lost and two families living unfamiliar, opposite lives. "The eternal struggle of Good vs Evil", says the bad guy. You bet, but it is all laid out in such style and confidence that it is overwhelmingly amazing. This is an example of excellence in a Genre that is ridiculously riddled with bullets but hardly ever so quintessential. This is one that all Movies of this type could aspire. For it is one of the best and succeeds in something that most of this type fail to accomplish. It has as much heart as it does heart pounding excitement.

    John Woo's intense camera, and editing is a remarkable feat in this film. The camera is always moving, always involved, and fast paced editing make for a powerful, action-packed movie. John Travolta gratefully hams his performance, alongside the demented acting of Nicolas Cage. The two actors are rightfully having a blast in this movie, playing outsized and campy action villains and heroes. However I find the movie lacking in its vapidity and many extraneous scenes. Many of the characters are poorly acted and written, and there is little sense in the story. Despite its style and masterful execution, I still find it lacking, even as a piece of pure fluff entertainment. The movie is outrageous and entertaining, but nevertheless, pretty horrendous.

    Face/Off is the best John Woo Hollywood film by a mile. This had the budget, star power and a crazy, stupid script to carry his over the top style. It's a little long but that doesn't stop from being one of the most enjoyably stupid action films of the 90's. First off, we have two actors at their scenery chewing best - John Travolta and Nic Cage. We have great campy actors playing our main antagonist and hero. We have a crazy premise that they exploit to it's fullest potential, we have a decent story and character development sprinkled in and so on. Face/Off is more Hard Boiled and less The Killer or Better Tomorrow. Even at that, Hard Boiled is a much better action film and had a better cast. But for a Hollywood action film, Face/Off is hard to really compare it with something. And that's the best thing about it. Face/Off is a one of a kind film that only works because of the right people involved in the project. It's an over the top action extravaganza that has a story, characters and still manages to be absolutely insane.

    Everyone knows that both John Travolta and Nicolas Cage have strange acting careers  both of them starred in some great movies and both of them starred in some awful movies. Actually, nowadays it seems they act only in awful-to-average movies, which is a shame since I think both of them are talented actors. Face/Off is a 1997 action movie directed by the famous action movie director John Woo and it serves as a proof of how Cage and Travolta are really good actors. And it's also one of the better movies in both their careers. Face/Off is a story about two men  one is a cop named Sean Archer (John Travolta) and one is a crazy terrorist named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Troy has killed Archer's son several years ago and since then the two have been mortal enemies. One day Archer finally manages to capture Troy and accidentally puts him in a coma  but not before he finds out the place where Troy has put a bomb meant to explode in a couple of days. So, Archer undergoes heavy surgery and switches faces with Troy in an attempt to speak with Castor Troy's brother - Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola)  and find out where they planted the bomb. The plan backfires when Castor Troy wakes up from his coma and takes Archer's face. The two then start a dangerous game of cat and mouse. The best thing about Face/Off are the performances. Both Cage and Travolta had to play two completely different people with completely different personalities; and they were very successful in doing so. Interestingly enough both of them are better at playing the eccentric lunatic Castor Troy than in playing the part of the stoic cop Sean Archer. And if history taught us anything, it is that Nicolas Cage is absolutely amazing in playing crazy people. In the beginning of the movie, we see Cage dressed up as a priest who starts headbanging and dancing in front of a choir that is singing Hallelujah. If that's not a good enough reason to see this movie, I don't know what is. Although this is mainly a performance driven movie, the action in it is pretty decent and some action scenes were brilliantly directed. Unfortunately, other action scenes appeared to me as somewhat pretentious and overblown, mostly towards the end of the movie. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in action movies but it goes completely against the depressive tone of the rest of the movie. Face/Off is essentially a movie about identity crisis and dealing with the possibility of someone else living with your family; it doesn't need exaggerated action scenes. However, in spite of that, Face/Off is still a fun movie with wonderful performances that will leave you satisfied. It is a rather worthy collaboration of two talented actors who deserve much more out of their careers. Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/

    Face/Off is an outstanding movie with a breathtaking and intense storyline and magnificent performances all around.The two lead actors,John Travolta and Nicolas Cage,are amazing in this movie,they are two actors that I find very hit and miss,especially Nicolas Cage,an actor that I had never been really impressed with in the past,but I will forever respect both of these actors for their acting in this,they managed to pull off playing two different characters really well and stay through to the others personality,this didn't seem like something that would be easy to do,but Travolta and Cage pulled it off perfectly.I didn't see anything not to like about this movie and I don't know how it's not on the IMDb Top 250,it is a must see for fans of action and crime movies. Sean Archer (John Travolta) must stop a bomb set up by Caston Troy (Nicolas Cage),a terrorist who killed his son,by switching faces with him by a surgical operation,but he is put into prison and Caston disguised as Sean destroys every piece of evidence that they switched faces,so Sean must find a way to escape and prove who he really is.

    Hey, guys! This is not a chick-flick movie and for sure you're not going to say, "It's lame, so boring!" Face/off is a hardcore, breath-taking; action, crime, thriller movie directed by John Woo in 1997. John Woo is known for Mission Impossible II with Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. I love this movie; it's one of Nicolas Cage's movies I've ever watched aside from Con Air. This movie is all about this tough federal bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent, Sean Archer (John Travolta), who has been chasing to seize Caster Troy (Nicolas cage), the terrorist who has no conscience, mastermind behind bombings, assassinations, murder, kidnapping and the most dangerous and most brilliant criminal. John Travolta and his team found a way to capture Caster Troy (Nicolas Cage) through this black bag operation, but nobody should ever know about this suicidal operation, not even Sean Archer's wife, Dr. Eve Archer (Joan Allen). It's a plastic surgery procedure at Walsh Institute supervised by Dr. Walsh. The procedure will remove and switch each other's face. Meaning John Travolta will be Nicolas Cage and vice versa. Nicolas Cage planted a bomb at the L.A. Convention that only he and his brother Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola), know and the government is trying to figure out where this bomb is at. Meanwhile, after Caster Troy and his brother's police encounter at the private plane port, a plane's exhaust running hot, hit Caster Troy's body towards a huge screen vents which made him suffer comatose, but they caught Pollux Troy. FBI agents tried to interrogate people related to Caster Troy to find out the location of the bomb. Sean Archer even threat Sasha (Gina Gershon), Troy's girlfriend, that if she will not tell the truth, he'll take away her child. Sasha's brother asked Archer about his dead son, he's convince that Troy annihilate his son. Now, Sean Archer doesn't have any choice, but to say yes to their secluded mission. Agent Hollis convinced Sean Archer to do it, since Caster Troy is a turnip and he is the only one who can deactivate the bomb and besides, this will be the only way penalize and emplace Caster Troy behind bars from killing his loving son, Michael. Sean Archer went home to see his wife and daughter Jaime before the operation, he said, "I'll be gone for a while;" and promised that it will be the last and he will definite spend more time with his family. Sean Archer wished to Dr. Walsh; to put his gun shot scar back on his chest because it reminds him of his son, and gave Tito (FBI agent), his wedding ring; they've trimmed Archer's hair and planted a microchip into his larynx to duplicate Troy's voice. Archer didn't like wearing his enemy's face, he abruptly became violent, threw hospital mirror scintillating, cussed and swear everyone and cried, and knowing the next move is to lift him to Arrow One prison. There Archer is a citizen of nowhere, wearing a pair of boots made of metal, locked down on the floor surrounded by a ground full of magnetic field so, there's no way to escape. Meanwhile, at the Walsh Institute where they kept Caster Troy, he miraculously woke up from coma; removed his bandage and felt blood on his face. He called his friend with a husky, shaking, voice and told him that someone took his face off with a help of a doctor and two FBI agents. They abduct Dr. Walsh and the other two agents behind the operation, tied them up, poured gasoline on them and burnt them alive together with the evidences that will prove Sean Archer's real personality. In the Arrow One prison, Sean Archer got a visitorit's Caster Troy wearing his face and wedding ring, laughing crazy on how their mission failed and told Sean Archer (Troy's face), "I've got a government job to abuse and a wife to f***! Isn't that amazing?" teasing and making him mad. Archer's now finding out how to escape Arrow One prison to tell his wife Eve that he's Sean Archer. Face/Off is a great, action packed movie, tons of enigmatic scenes and stunts, big actors involved, with 7.3 stars, received lots of awards, a MUST watch movie.

    This a review I wrote for my blog (cagedcinema.tumblr.com) When I started this blog I wasn't quite sure with what film I'd want to kick off my reviews of the films of Nicolas Cage. His filmography is quite vast; clocking almost 70 films (and more to come). Also, the huge differences between some of his films (in quality and in tone/genre/style) make it hard to choose a good "entry-level" film that exemplifies the qualities of Nicolas Cage. Eventually, though, my eyes lay on John Woo's Face/Off: A film that perfectly introduces the screen presence of Cage. Please bear with me with the following description of the film's plot, because it's going to be complicated. Face/Off, John Woo's (Hardboiled, Mission: Impossible II) third American film, stars John Travolta as FBI Special Agent Sean Archer, a sober and driven man who dedicated his life to take revenge on freewheeling terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), the assassin of his son. The grief for his lost son results in Archer neglecting his wife and daughter; his wife hasn't had sex in months and his daughter is full of teenage angst. Quickly though, Archer seems to get his revenge when a vehicle and action packed shootout in and around an airport hanger results in Castor Troy getting incapacitated. The villain seems to be defeated, but problems arise: Troy has planted a chemical bomb somewhere in LA. Time is ticking and the main source for information regarding the whereabouts of the bomb, Castor Troy, is in a coma. In order to save the day, Sean Archer through an unlikely construction - has to become Castor Troy now to retrieve Intel on the bomb from Troy's paranoid and incarcerated brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola). This is where the plot gets interesting. A surgeon switches Sean's face with the face of Castor and alters the other bodily features of the reluctant agent. When Archer wakes up after the procedure, he wakes up in the body of his archenemy. Thus now Nicolas Cage has to act like he is the character of John Travolta! It gets even more interesting when, after Archer (still in the body of Troy/Cage) is being brought to the prison of Troy's brother, Castor Troy wakes up from his coma without a face. He forces the same surgeon to perform the opposite transplantation: Caster Troy becomes Sean Archer, Nicolas Cage becomes John Travolta. After the operation Troy makes sure to neatly erase all the evidence of this operation (read: killing everyone involved). Now the whole film revolts on the two actors acting like they are each other. This results in some brilliant bits. For instance John Travolta (with the personality of Cage's character) making fun of his own ridiculous chin, or Nicolas Cage (with the personality of Travolta's character) taking too much drugs with the villains henchmen: bragging probably tripping on drugs for the first time "I'm going to take his face Off!" while he is crawling over the floor. For both of the rivals the physical metamorphosis has severe psychological implications as well. Villain and womanizer Troy has to play a family man, while white knight Archer reluctantly has to hang out with criminal friends and followers of Troy. Archer even finds out, without Troy knowing that his nemesis has a son of his own. Although both characters are clearly not comfortable in their role  which becomes painfully clear by the laughing of the characters that evolves in pitiful cries  they both bring some of the qualities of their personality (Archers' conscience and Troy's joyful swagger) to the lives of their opponents. Still, this is all in between the over-the-top action scenes, with shootouts, set pieces and visual effects unlike any other film. Hyper stylized action scenes are a signature of John Woo, and this film is clearly no exception. Fireworks literally explode everywhere, while the hero and villain dive, roll and almost fly through the extravagant sets. In some films the action scenes can't really keep me interested because of their lack of emotional significance and originality, but this films absurd and sometimes hilarious sequencing kept me very excited. Juxtaposed against all the grotesque action scenes are the showdowns that take place on a more personal level. The encounters between the opponents throughout the film are executed very well. I found the showdown between Castor and Sean in a room full of mirrors very clever. Face/Off is very difficult film to follow. When the final "face-off" (pun inevitable) of the film draws near, it's not quite clear who is on whose side and why. Still, the film provides enough character development and motivation to keep its viewers interested in the plot. I have to say that this is maybe the action film with some of the most interesting character developments. Above all, the most enjoyable part of this film is seeing Nicolas Cage and John Travolta act like each other. Both deliver amazing performances. The script forces John Travolta to play outside of his body; including the typical Cage freak-outs and looks, while Cage's has to keep his performance more weighted; as if he is a prisoner of his own body. Still both of the actors, fortunately, get to show off their fame-making style of acting more than enough. Face/Off is a ridiculous film. With a premises that is full of gimmicks and ambiguities, action scenes that are unbelievably extravagant and a script full of cheesy lines ("It's like looking in the mirror, but only NOT"). Also it is a film made with passion and enthusiasm, screaming fun in almost every scene (some are quite sad though). This is a kind of action flick that doesn't get made in this day and age anymore. In the end Face/off also shows how Nicolas Cage can handle both his theatrical out-of-body style of acting and a more restricted and introvert role at once, therefore I think this is the perfect start for everyone interested in giving the cinema of Nicolas Cage a change.

    This movie has everything in it. From action to drama, love to hate, emotions to revenge, this has it all. Very well written and directed. But most of all the brilliance of two greats of Hollywood, Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. I would describe their performance as extreme of acting, beyond perfection. They absolutely made it an epic, how well they performed their and each other's role it's simply amazing. This movie is after 15 years is still the best in my list. I have watched it for like 50 times and every time I see it I even enjoy it more. I would highly recommend this to any action movie lover, go ahead and buy the DVD and watch it at your first chance.

    I am left with no other conclusion other than the producers of this movie went out and found any and all who in their poor taste in entertainment bought this video, or DVD. The mere notion that you can of simply removing someone's facing and surgically transplanting it onto someone else's skull to completely change their appearance is preposterous. I rented the video years ago from Blockbuster, probably not long after it hit the video store shelves. I can easily think of 5 Cage movies far better: 8 Millimeter, Lord Of War, Con Air, Match Stick Men, Thunder Birds, and Ghost Rider. I guess some people adore some actors so much no matter how poorly written the script is they will still praise the movie.
