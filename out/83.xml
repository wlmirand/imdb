    I loved this movie when it first came out 20 years ago and I think mostly cause I had such a crush on Robert Sean Leonard. I didn't get a lot of the story line or humor it when I was younger. I was only 9 when it came to theaters. I now own the movie and just recently saw it again. I hadn't seen it in a long time. Now I can't seem to get enough of it. I fell in love with the movie all over again. This time for other reasons like the plot and humor of it. The acting is superb by all. My favorite is no longer Claudio but Bennedick and then Beatrice. I think they had the most chemistry between them. It helps that the actors were married to each other at the time. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I highly recommend you rent it and see it.

    This is based on a classic William Shakespeare's play. Which is a comedy that revolves around two relationships and finding love. One is the two older quick witted, fiery and experienced characters that doesn't admit to their feelings for one another. Because of pride and that tug and pull game. And the other is two love birds that blossom with attraction and romantic feelings for one another. And a villain that is trying to scheme and manipulate the situation. I personally thought this film actually did a good job of keeping up with the spirit and essence of the William Shakespeare's play. And all the actors and actresses did a good job. Especially Denzel Washington who owns his role with ease and without much forced effort. The young Kate Beckinsale is also in this and all I can say is, she looks better as she ages...For now at least. Personally I thought Keanu Reeves did a fine job playing the villain. Except maybe the part where he gives a villainous laugh. This is Shakespeare's play done well, and if your one of the audiences that enjoy Shakespeare's work. There is a high chance you won't be disappointed with this one. 8.2/10

    One of Shakespeare's greatest romantic comedies, adapted and Directed by one of Shakespeare's greatest aficionados, Mr Kenneth Branagh, this film is brilliant. The ensemble cast make the film a wonderful viewing experience; Richard Briars, Brian Blessed, Kate Beckinsale, Robert Sean Leonard, Keanu Reeves, Emma Thompson, Imelda Staunton, Denzel Washington and Michael Keaton to name a few. It is filmed simply, as a costume drama, making the most of a country house and gardens in Messina, Sicily. The comedy is played up - especially brilliant by the greasy Keaton as the over-eager Constable Dogberry, Branagh and Thompson and the trick that is thought up by Denzel Washington's Prince. The older more seasoned actors are stunning in this - Branagh and Thompson speak their lines as if it were plain modern English and bring it alive, Washington - always brilliant - is beautifully cast. Much has been made of Reeves playing the evil Don John woodenly but his aggressive and solid dark performance is a great foil for the light fluffy acting of everyone else and he's got Shakespeare lead experience up to his ears. I felt the weak performance was Robert Sean Leonard, and his eagerness was a little cringeworthy but he still played well in the ensemble. It has song and dance, is exuberant and jubilant, sexy, romantic funny and above all fun. Any time I watch it I feel so happy afterwards, the finale of the big wedding and dance. Great viewing. And, any womens' knees are sure to tremble at Washington's line, "Would you have me, lady?" or all the men coming riding over the hill... Wonderful film, lovely story and great performances. Laugh out loud humour, great musical score (the song "Pardon Goddess of the Night" is stunning) and flawless direction. Branagh is worth every award, as is Thompson - they were a formidable acting powerhouse couple.

    What a delightful film/play! It's both funny and dramatic and I thought that it was excellently cast. Kenneth Branaugh and Emma Thompson, in my eyes the King and Queen of Shakespeare, were a fabulous Benedick and Beatrice. A very young Kate Beckinsale was a lovely Hero, and Denzel Washington delighted me as Don Pedro, the Prince. I've never seen Much Ado About Nothing in play form before, but I thought it made for a wonderful film. One got to see the beautiful Italian countryside and villa where the play takes place. The costumes were simple but beautiful, and there was also a lovely incorporation of music and song into the scenes. There is nothing quite like live performance, which is what Shakespeare intended for his plays, yet I find that I appreciate all the possibilities that film presents.

    Having seen this film when it was released and having disliked it at the time, then watched it again recently, disliked it even more. The worst defect is the overacting. Emma Thompson is perfectly dreadful as she overdoes it in every scene she has; but the rest of the cast also overact, their facial expressions animated like some cartoon. They all mug to camera except Washington but his part is semi-regal. The less said about Michael Keaton's performance the better - it is comically rank. His accent is a bogus Irish stevedore stuck in Tuscany. The other annoying feature is the glued on grins and smiles as if this is a Carry On film. If only Sid James had appeared to add some class. And finally the music is a sticky overbearing aural goop that lacks nuance. Film music and Shakespeare are not good companions and in this case, to quote, 'The Tempest', "misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows." The play is one of Shakespeare's very best. It is the very first romantic comedy with ill-matched lovers who find love, but none of that brilliant sparring battle between Benedick and Beatrice is here.

    This is a movie I watch about once a year. The opening 10 minutes are worth it alone... Emma Thompson's lilting voice reading Shakespeare's verse "Hey Nonny Nonny" about philandering men against the backdrop of gorgeous Tuscany: the white bodices of the women, the red of the grapes and then the scene with the men riding in ... great movie making!! The banter between Benedick (Branagh) and Beatrice (Thompson) is perfect, I loved all the American actors, particularly Denzel Washington as the Prince and Keanu Reeves as the bastard brother.. they were both very good. I also really appreciate Branagh's interpretation of Shakespeare and his delivery.. and the way he encourages the ensemble to deliver Shakespeare, so much more real than the awkward Shakespeare delivery of old. With any Shakespeare piece, you know the story has to be excellent and Much Ado About Nothing is no exception. This is a wonderful romp through the countryside of Tuscany, the music is very good, there are some hilarious scenes and the costumes are just magical. My teenage daughters love it too and I have introduced this movie to teenagers and young people not "into" Shakespeare and they all loved it. 10 stars. This movie will last.

    If I were to vote, this movie just solely based on him it would have been a ten, but then the others were involved so it became so. When I read Much Ado About Nothing, I wasn't expecting Dogberry to be this zany. It was a real laugh watching Michael Keaton perform. That is, I'm praising him of his splendid role-playing. Michael Keaton's acting was really entertaining to say the least. Except for Benedick, out of all the characters I was mostly drawn to him for the way he portrayed Dogberry. Not having known that he played as Batman and just remembered him as the father of Lindsay Lohan in Herbie. I was fully impressed! If you want to see Michael Keaton acting a crazier side, see this film. It's a pity that he came out in just 4 scenes.

    Soooo This is a great movie. Mainly just due to the cast, more so the outstanding cast doing Shakespeare: Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Kate Beckinsale, Emma Thompson, Michael Keaton (essentially playing Beetle Juice all over again in Shakespeare)... Denzel is actually really good in Shakespeare so is Emma Thompson (obviously). But that's not what makes this movie great. It's freaking Keanu and Robert Sean Leonard (aka Wilson from House). Robert is actually pretty great. But it's so funny watching Wilson rattling off Shakespeare with such passion, trotting along side Denzel and Keanu in great outfit. And also shoving down Kate Beckinsale. Also Keanu chuckling manically but really poorly is great. Just look at the movie poster and one could completely understand. It's essentially Shakespeare made movies at its best. Thrilling, somewhat random, but the most entertaining modern interpretation of Shakespeare. SO HEY Nonny, nonny, nonny

    Whether you enjoy it or not, it is a solid fact that William Shakespeare was one of the best, if not the best, writer of all time. His tragedies and comedies set so many milestones in storytelling, and have continued to influence all creative mediums today, including film. The man obviously had an influence on Kenneth Branagh, the director of Much Ado About Nothing. This film is one of five Shakespeare film adaptations that Branagh has directed. It is about two lovers, Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) and Hero (Kate Beckinsale) who are to be married in one week. To pass the time they devise a "love trap" for two of their family members. One is an arrogant and yet bumbling bachelor named Benedict (Kenneth Branagh) and the other is the strong willed and witty Beatrice (Emma Thompson). But in the midst of it all a man by the name of Don Jon (Keanu Reeves) conspires to stop the wedding. Overall the film is lighthearted, simple, and fun. However, it retains a much more sophisticated eloquence that definitely sets it apart from other films equally as lighthearted as it. When you're script is a word for word adaptation of the Shakespeare play, it is obvious you are going to have a fantastic story with great dialouge. There is just no denying that Shakespeare was a genius and comparatively had hardly any flaws in his work. The trick for a film adaptation of his play is to provide excellent visual aesthetics that will match the eloquence of the script. Branagh hits his mark excellently here. The film is something beautiful to look at. In every shot and every location it is obvious a lot of care and attention was put into making this film look as pretty as it sounds. The sets are beautifully designed, as well as the costumes which are all very consistent and fitting for the medieval time period. Branagh's direction is also top notch and he excels at being able to transform a script written for the stage into a very full on-screen experience. Branagh makes sure to put a lot of emphasis on the actors, since the characters are where the central focus of this story lies. But when he is not honing in on his actors he is utilizing fantastic tracking shots that show off the gorgeous sets and artistic design that went into them. The visual and audible aspects of this film thankfully lock together perfectly. As I said before there is a lot of emphasis on the actors in this film, and while the majority of the acting is well above par, there is a noticeable issue with it overall, but it is something almost out of the directors control. Shakespeare is not easy to act believably. The kind of acting necessary to make Shakespeare feel real as opposed to cheesy is in a league of its own. It has a lot to do with the dialect and style in which his work is written, which is obviously hundreds of years old and far different from how we speak today. It is because of this extremely specific acting style the actors must utilize to pull off these characters that we see a differentiation in the acting ability of the cast. In other words, we can tell who is a well versed Shakespearian actor and who is not. Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson are the shining stars of this film and it is very obvious that this style of acting is their field of expertise. It is a place where they feel comfortable and can truly act the part without forcing it in the Shakespearian dialect. Then we have other actors like Robert Sean Leonard and Denzel Washington who, despite being great in this film, are not actors of the same caliber when it comes to Shakespeare. I just couldn't believe Leonard and Washington as much as I did Branagh and Thompson, but it certainly doesn't mean they weren't very good in the film. And then of course at the bottom of the barrel we have Keanu Reeves who I won't even get started on. All I will say is that watching Reeves try to act Shakespeare is a painful experience. Much Ado About Nothing is definitely a very good film. It is very well made and, for the most part, very well acted. Watching a movie directly adapted from a Shakespeare play without removing any of the dialect of the time period is a breath of fresh air from your typical 21st century writing style. Now I will say on a more personal note that the story in Much Ado About Nothing, while very well written, is not exactly my cup of tea. Shakespeare only wrote in two genres... tragedy, and comedy. Much Ado About Nothing is one of the latter, so obviously it is very happy-go-lucky. My personal taste leans towards the darker tragedies that Shakespeare wrote, so I personally would recommend one of those before Much Ado About Nothing, but the film, for what it is, is still very good.

    Actually I've always been a fan of Shakespeare, but this movie took it to a whole new level. I found this quite by accident (flipping through channels and stopping when I wondered what were Denzel Washington AND Robert Sean Leonard doing in the same flick) On the whole, what I love about this movie is how natural the dialogue and setting are; none of the stilted portrayals I've come to associate with Shakespeare. For me, the biggest treat in this movie is basically any scene with Branagh and Thompson. Branagh IS Benedick, with all of his arrogance, bravado and chivalry. Thompson plays a beautiful and fiery Beatrice, and brings across the most believable portrayal I've seen of a Shakespeare heroine. Beckinsale and Leonard do a good job as Hero and Claudio. Although I know that Leonard gets some flak for his acting here, I think he brings across the impulsive and rash nature of his character well enough. Keaton and Washington are okay in their roles; I didn't find Keaton that distracting as Dogberry. Reeves could have done a little better in fleshing out his character--he's the reason for the 9/10 here.

The film is something beautiful to look at. In every shot and every location it is obvious a lot of care and attention was put into making this film look as pretty as it sounds. The sets are beautifully designed, as well as the costumes which are all very consistent and fitting for the medieval time period. Branagh's direction is also top notch and he excels at being able to transform a script written for the stage into a very full on-screen experience. Branagh makes sure to put a lot of emphasis on the actors, since the characters are where the central focus of this story lies. But when he is not honing in on his actors he is utilizing fantastic tracking shots that show off the gorgeous sets and artistic design that went into them. The visual and audible aspects of this film thankfully lock together perfectly. As I said before there is a lot of emphasis on the actors in this film, and while the majority of the acting is well above par, there is a noticeable issue with it overall, but it is something almost out of the directors control. Shakespeare is not easy to act believably. The kind of acting necessary to make Shakespeare feel real as opposed to cheesy is in a league of its own. It has a lot to do with the dialect and style in which his work is written, which is obviously hundreds of years old and far different from how we speak today. It is because of this extremely specific acting style the actors must utilize to pull off these characters that we see a differentiation in the acting ability of the cast. In other words, we can tell who is a well versed Shakespearian actor and who is not. Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson are the shining stars of this film and it is very obvious that this style of acting is their field of expertise. It is a place where they feel comfortable and can truly act the part without forcing it in the Shakespearian dialect. Then we have other actors like Robert Sean Leonard and Denzel Washington who, despite being great in this film, are not actors of the same caliber when it comes to Shakespeare. I just couldn't believe Leonard and Washington as much as I did Branagh and Thompson, but it certainly doesn't mean they weren't very good in the film. And then of course at the bottom of the barrel we have Keanu Reeves who I won't even get started on. All I will say is that watching Reeves try to act Shakespeare is a painful experience. Much Ado About Nothing is definitely a very good film. It is very well made and, for the most part, very well acted. Watching a movie directly adapted from a Shakespeare play without removing any of the dialect of the time period is a breath of fresh air from your typical 21st century writing style. Now I will say on a more personal note that the story in Much Ado About Nothing, while very well written, is not exactly my cup of tea. Shakespeare only wrote in two genres... tragedy, and comedy. Much Ado About Nothing is one of the latter, so obviously it is very happy-go-lucky. My personal taste leans towards the darker tragedies that Shakespeare wrote, so I personally would recommend one of those before Much Ado About Nothing, but the film, for what it is, is still very good.

    Actually I've always been a fan of Shakespeare, but this movie took it to a whole new level. I found this quite by accident (flipping through channels and stopping when I wondered what were Denzel Washington AND Robert Sean Leonard doing in the same flick) On the whole, what I love about this movie is how natural the dialogue and setting are; none of the stilted portrayals I've come to associate with Shakespeare. For me, the biggest treat in this movie is basically any scene with Branagh and Thompson. Branagh IS Benedick, with all of his arrogance, bravado and chivalry. Thompson plays a beautiful and fiery Beatrice, and brings across the most believable portrayal I've seen of a Shakespeare heroine. Beckinsale and Leonard do a good job as Hero and Claudio. Although I know that Leonard gets some flak for his acting here, I think he brings across the impulsive and rash nature of his character well enough. Keaton and Washington are okay in their roles; I didn't find Keaton that distracting as Dogberry. Reeves could have done a little better in fleshing out his character--he's the reason for the 9/10 here.

    I loved this movie when it first came out 20 years ago and I think mostly cause I had such a crush on Robert Sean Leonard. I didn't get a lot of the story line or humor it when I was younger. I was only 9 when it came to theaters. I now own the movie and just recently saw it again. I hadn't seen it in a long time. Now I can't seem to get enough of it. I fell in love with the movie all over again. This time for other reasons like the plot and humor of it. The acting is superb by all. My favorite is no longer Claudio but Bennedick and then Beatrice. I think they had the most chemistry between them. It helps that the actors were married to each other at the time. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I highly recommend you rent it and see it.

    This is based on a classic William Shakespeare's play. Which is a comedy that revolves around two relationships and finding love. One is the two older quick witted, fiery and experienced characters that doesn't admit to their feelings for one another. Because of pride and that tug and pull game. And the other is two love birds that blossom with attraction and romantic feelings for one another. And a villain that is trying to scheme and manipulate the situation. I personally thought this film actually did a good job of keeping up with the spirit and essence of the William Shakespeare's play. And all the actors and actresses did a good job. Especially Denzel Washington who owns his role with ease and without much forced effort. The young Kate Beckinsale is also in this and all I can say is, she looks better as she ages...For now at least. Personally I thought Keanu Reeves did a fine job playing the villain. Except maybe the part where he gives a villainous laugh. This is Shakespeare's play done well, and if your one of the audiences that enjoy Shakespeare's work. There is a high chance you won't be disappointed with this one. 8.2/10

    One of Shakespeare's greatest romantic comedies, adapted and Directed by one of Shakespeare's greatest aficionados, Mr Kenneth Branagh, this film is brilliant. The ensemble cast make the film a wonderful viewing experience; Richard Briars, Brian Blessed, Kate Beckinsale, Robert Sean Leonard, Keanu Reeves, Emma Thompson, Imelda Staunton, Denzel Washington and Michael Keaton to name a few. It is filmed simply, as a costume drama, making the most of a country house and gardens in Messina, Sicily. The comedy is played up - especially brilliant by the greasy Keaton as the over-eager Constable Dogberry, Branagh and Thompson and the trick that is thought up by Denzel Washington's Prince. The older more seasoned actors are stunning in this - Branagh and Thompson speak their lines as if it were plain modern English and bring it alive, Washington - always brilliant - is beautifully cast. Much has been made of Reeves playing the evil Don John woodenly but his aggressive and solid dark performance is a great foil for the light fluffy acting of everyone else and he's got Shakespeare lead experience up to his ears. I felt the weak performance was Robert Sean Leonard, and his eagerness was a little cringeworthy but he still played well in the ensemble. It has song and dance, is exuberant and jubilant, sexy, romantic funny and above all fun. Any time I watch it I feel so happy afterwards, the finale of the big wedding and dance. Great viewing. And, any womens' knees are sure to tremble at Washington's line, "Would you have me, lady?" or all the men coming riding over the hill... Wonderful film, lovely story and great performances. Laugh out loud humour, great musical score (the song "Pardon Goddess of the Night" is stunning) and flawless direction. Branagh is worth every award, as is Thompson - they were a formidable acting powerhouse couple.

    What a delightful film/play! It's both funny and dramatic and I thought that it was excellently cast. Kenneth Branaugh and Emma Thompson, in my eyes the King and Queen of Shakespeare, were a fabulous Benedick and Beatrice. A very young Kate Beckinsale was a lovely Hero, and Denzel Washington delighted me as Don Pedro, the Prince. I've never seen Much Ado About Nothing in play form before, but I thought it made for a wonderful film. One got to see the beautiful Italian countryside and villa where the play takes place. The costumes were simple but beautiful, and there was also a lovely incorporation of music and song into the scenes. There is nothing quite like live performance, which is what Shakespeare intended for his plays, yet I find that I appreciate all the possibilities that film presents.

    Having seen this film when it was released and having disliked it at the time, then watched it again recently, disliked it even more. The worst defect is the overacting. Emma Thompson is perfectly dreadful as she overdoes it in every scene she has; but the rest of the cast also overact, their facial expressions animated like some cartoon. They all mug to camera except Washington but his part is semi-regal. The less said about Michael Keaton's performance the better - it is comically rank. His accent is a bogus Irish stevedore stuck in Tuscany. The other annoying feature is the glued on grins and smiles as if this is a Carry On film. If only Sid James had appeared to add some class. And finally the music is a sticky overbearing aural goop that lacks nuance. Film music and Shakespeare are not good companions and in this case, to quote, 'The Tempest', "misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows." The play is one of Shakespeare's very best. It is the very first romantic comedy with ill-matched lovers who find love, but none of that brilliant sparring battle between Benedick and Beatrice is here.

    This is a movie I watch about once a year. The opening 10 minutes are worth it alone... Emma Thompson's lilting voice reading Shakespeare's verse "Hey Nonny Nonny" about philandering men against the backdrop of gorgeous Tuscany: the white bodices of the women, the red of the grapes and then the scene with the men riding in ... great movie making!! The banter between Benedick (Branagh) and Beatrice (Thompson) is perfect, I loved all the American actors, particularly Denzel Washington as the Prince and Keanu Reeves as the bastard brother.. they were both very good. I also really appreciate Branagh's interpretation of Shakespeare and his delivery.. and the way he encourages the ensemble to deliver Shakespeare, so much more real than the awkward Shakespeare delivery of old. With any Shakespeare piece, you know the story has to be excellent and Much Ado About Nothing is no exception. This is a wonderful romp through the countryside of Tuscany, the music is very good, there are some hilarious scenes and the costumes are just magical. My teenage daughters love it too and I have introduced this movie to teenagers and young people not "into" Shakespeare and they all loved it. 10 stars. This movie will last.

    If I were to vote, this movie just solely based on him it would have been a ten, but then the others were involved so it became so. When I read Much Ado About Nothing, I wasn't expecting Dogberry to be this zany. It was a real laugh watching Michael Keaton perform. That is, I'm praising him of his splendid role-playing. Michael Keaton's acting was really entertaining to say the least. Except for Benedick, out of all the characters I was mostly drawn to him for the way he portrayed Dogberry. Not having known that he played as Batman and just remembered him as the father of Lindsay Lohan in Herbie. I was fully impressed! If you want to see Michael Keaton acting a crazier side, see this film. It's a pity that he came out in just 4 scenes.

    Soooo This is a great movie. Mainly just due to the cast, more so the outstanding cast doing Shakespeare: Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Kate Beckinsale, Emma Thompson, Michael Keaton (essentially playing Beetle Juice all over again in Shakespeare)... Denzel is actually really good in Shakespeare so is Emma Thompson (obviously). But that's not what makes this movie great. It's freaking Keanu and Robert Sean Leonard (aka Wilson from House). Robert is actually pretty great. But it's so funny watching Wilson rattling off Shakespeare with such passion, trotting along side Denzel and Keanu in great outfit. And also shoving down Kate Beckinsale. Also Keanu chuckling manically but really poorly is great. Just look at the movie poster and one could completely understand. It's essentially Shakespeare made movies at its best. Thrilling, somewhat random, but the most entertaining modern interpretation of Shakespeare. SO HEY Nonny, nonny, nonny

    Whether you enjoy it or not, it is a solid fact that William Shakespeare was one of the best, if not the best, writer of all time. His tragedies and comedies set so many milestones in storytelling, and have continued to influence all creative mediums today, including film. The man obviously had an influence on Kenneth Branagh, the director of Much Ado About Nothing. This film is one of five Shakespeare film adaptations that Branagh has directed. It is about two lovers, Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) and Hero (Kate Beckinsale) who are to be married in one week. To pass the time they devise a "love trap" for two of their family members. One is an arrogant and yet bumbling bachelor named Benedict (Kenneth Branagh) and the other is the strong willed and witty Beatrice (Emma Thompson). But in the midst of it all a man by the name of Don Jon (Keanu Reeves) conspires to stop the wedding. Overall the film is lighthearted, simple, and fun. However, it retains a much more sophisticated eloquence that definitely sets it apart from other films equally as lighthearted as it. When you're script is a word for word adaptation of the Shakespeare play, it is obvious you are going to have a fantastic story with great dialouge. There is just no denying that Shakespeare was a genius and comparatively had hardly any flaws in his work. The trick for a film adaptation of his play is to provide excellent visual aesthetics that will match the eloquence of the script. Branagh hits his mark excellently here. The film is something beautiful to look at. In every shot and every location it is obvious a lot of care and attention was put into making this film look as pretty as it sounds. The sets are beautifully designed, as well as the costumes which are all very consistent and fitting for the medieval time period. Branagh's direction is also top notch and he excels at being able to transform a script written for the stage into a very full on-screen experience. Branagh makes sure to put a lot of emphasis on the actors, since the characters are where the central focus of this story lies. But when he is not honing in on his actors he is utilizing fantastic tracking shots that show off the gorgeous sets and artistic design that went into them. The visual and audible aspects of this film thankfully lock together perfectly. As I said before there is a lot of emphasis on the actors in this film, and while the majority of the acting is well above par, there is a noticeable issue with it overall, but it is something almost out of the directors control. Shakespeare is not easy to act believably. The kind of acting necessary to make Shakespeare feel real as opposed to cheesy is in a league of its own. It has a lot to do with the dialect and style in which his work is written, which is obviously hundreds of years old and far different from how we speak today. It is because of this extremely specific acting style the actors must utilize to pull off these characters that we see a differentiation in the acting ability of the cast. In other words, we can tell who is a well versed Shakespearian actor and who is not. Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson are the shining stars of this film and it is very obvious that this style of acting is their field of expertise. It is a place where they feel comfortable and can truly act the part without forcing it in the Shakespearian dialect. Then we have other actors like Robert Sean Leonard and Denzel Washington who, despite being great in this film, are not actors of the same caliber when it comes to Shakespeare. I just couldn't believe Leonard and Washington as much as I did Branagh and Thompson, but it certainly doesn't mean they weren't very good in the film.

Now I will say on a more personal note that the story in Much Ado About Nothing, while very well written, is not exactly my cup of tea. Shakespeare only wrote in two genres... tragedy, and comedy. Much Ado About Nothing is one of the latter, so obviously it is very happy-go-lucky. My personal taste leans towards the darker tragedies that Shakespeare wrote, so I personally would recommend one of those before Much Ado About Nothing, but the film, for what it is, is still very good.

Robert is actually pretty great. But it's so funny watching Wilson rattling off Shakespeare with such passion, trotting along side Denzel and Keanu in great outfit. And also shoving down Kate Beckinsale. Also Keanu chuckling manically but really poorly is great. Just look at the movie poster and one could completely understand. It's essentially Shakespeare made movies at its best. Thrilling, somewhat random, but the most entertaining modern interpretation of Shakespeare. SO HEY Nonny, nonny, nonny

    Whether you enjoy it or not, it is a solid fact that William Shakespeare was one of the best, if not the best, writer of all time. His tragedies and comedies set so many milestones in storytelling, and have continued to influence all creative mediums today, including film. The man obviously had an influence on Kenneth Branagh, the director of Much Ado About Nothing. This film is one of five Shakespeare film adaptations that Branagh has directed. It is about two lovers, Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) and Hero (Kate Beckinsale) who are to be married in one week. To pass the time they devise a "love trap" for two of their family members. One is an arrogant and yet bumbling bachelor named Benedict (Kenneth Branagh) and the other is the strong willed and witty Beatrice (Emma Thompson). But in the midst of it all a man by the name of Don Jon (Keanu Reeves) conspires to stop the wedding. Overall the film is lighthearted, simple, and fun. However, it retains a much more sophisticated eloquence that definitely sets it apart from other films equally as lighthearted as it. When you're script is a word for word adaptation of the Shakespeare play, it is obvious you are going to have a fantastic story with great dialouge. There is just no denying that Shakespeare was a genius and comparatively had hardly any flaws in his work. The trick for a film adaptation of his play is to provide excellent visual aesthetics that will match the eloquence of the script. Branagh hits his mark excellently here. The film is something beautiful to look at. In every shot and every location it is obvious a lot of care and attention was put into making this film look as pretty as it sounds. The sets are beautifully designed, as well as the costumes which are all very consistent and fitting for the medieval time period. Branagh's direction is also top notch and he excels at being able to transform a script written for the stage into a very full on-screen experience. Branagh makes sure to put a lot of emphasis on the actors, since the characters are where the central focus of this story lies. But when he is not honing in on his actors he is utilizing fantastic tracking shots that show off the gorgeous sets and artistic design that went into them. The visual and audible aspects of this film thankfully lock together perfectly. As I said before there is a lot of emphasis on the actors in this film, and while the majority of the acting is well above par, there is a noticeable issue with it overall, but it is something almost out of the directors control. Shakespeare is not easy to act believably. The kind of acting necessary to make Shakespeare feel real as opposed to cheesy is in a league of its own. It has a lot to do with the dialect and style in which his work is written, which is obviously hundreds of years old and far different from how we speak today. It is because of this extremely specific acting style the actors must utilize to pull off these characters that we see a differentiation in the acting ability of the cast. In other words, we can tell who is a well versed Shakespearian actor and who is not. Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson are the shining stars of this film and it is very obvious that this style of acting is their field of expertise. It is a place where they feel comfortable and can truly act the part without forcing it in the Shakespearian dialect. Then we have other actors like Robert Sean Leonard and Denzel Washington who, despite being great in this film, are not actors of the same caliber when it comes to Shakespeare. I just couldn't believe Leonard and Washington as much as I did Branagh and Thompson, but it certainly doesn't mean they weren't very good in the film. And then of course at the bottom of the barrel we have Keanu Reeves who I won't even get started on. All I will say is that watching Reeves try to act Shakespeare is a painful experience. Much Ado About Nothing is definitely a very good film. It is very well made and, for the most part, very well acted. Watching a movie directly adapted from a Shakespeare play without removing any of the dialect of the time period is a breath of fresh air from your typical 21st century writing style. Now I will say on a more personal note that the story in Much Ado About Nothing, while very well written, is not exactly my cup of tea. Shakespeare only wrote in two genres... tragedy, and comedy. Much Ado About Nothing is one of the latter, so obviously it is very happy-go-lucky. My personal taste leans towards the darker tragedies that Shakespeare wrote, so I personally would recommend one of those before Much Ado About Nothing, but the film, for what it is, is still very good.

    Actually I've always been a fan of Shakespeare, but this movie took it to a whole new level. I found this quite by accident (flipping through channels and stopping when I wondered what were Denzel Washington AND Robert Sean Leonard doing in the same flick) On the whole, what I love about this movie is how natural the dialogue and setting are; none of the stilted portrayals I've come to associate with Shakespeare. For me, the biggest treat in this movie is basically any scene with Branagh and Thompson. Branagh IS Benedick, with all of his arrogance, bravado and chivalry. Thompson plays a beautiful and fiery Beatrice, and brings across the most believable portrayal I've seen of a Shakespeare heroine. Beckinsale and Leonard do a good job as Hero and Claudio. Although I know that Leonard gets some flak for his acting here, I think he brings across the impulsive and rash nature of his character well enough. Keaton and Washington are okay in their roles; I didn't find Keaton that distracting as Dogberry. Reeves could have done a little better in fleshing out his character--he's the reason for the 9/10 here.

    I loved this movie when it first came out 20 years ago and I think mostly cause I had such a crush on Robert Sean Leonard. I didn't get a lot of the story line or humor it when I was younger. I was only 9 when it came to theaters. I now own the movie and just recently saw it again. I hadn't seen it in a long time. Now I can't seem to get enough of it. I fell in love with the movie all over again. This time for other reasons like the plot and humor of it. The acting is superb by all. My favorite is no longer Claudio but Bennedick and then Beatrice. I think they had the most chemistry between them. It helps that the actors were married to each other at the time. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I highly recommend you rent it and see it.

    This is based on a classic William Shakespeare's play. Which is a comedy that revolves around two relationships and finding love. One is the two older quick witted, fiery and experienced characters that doesn't admit to their feelings for one another. Because of pride and that tug and pull game. And the other is two love birds that blossom with attraction and romantic feelings for one another. And a villain that is trying to scheme and manipulate the situation. I personally thought this film actually did a good job of keeping up with the spirit and essence of the William Shakespeare's play. And all the actors and actresses did a good job. Especially Denzel Washington who owns his role with ease and without much forced effort. The young Kate Beckinsale is also in this and all I can say is, she looks better as she ages...For now at least. Personally I thought Keanu Reeves did a fine job playing the villain. Except maybe the part where he gives a villainous laugh. This is Shakespeare's play done well, and if your one of the audiences that enjoy Shakespeare's work. There is a high chance you won't be disappointed with this one. 8.2/10

    One of Shakespeare's greatest romantic comedies, adapted and Directed by one of Shakespeare's greatest aficionados, Mr Kenneth Branagh, this film is brilliant. The ensemble cast make the film a wonderful viewing experience; Richard Briars, Brian Blessed, Kate Beckinsale, Robert Sean Leonard, Keanu Reeves, Emma Thompson, Imelda Staunton, Denzel Washington and Michael Keaton to name a few. It is filmed simply, as a costume drama, making the most of a country house and gardens in Messina, Sicily. The comedy is played up - especially brilliant by the greasy Keaton as the over-eager Constable Dogberry, Branagh and Thompson and the trick that is thought up by Denzel Washington's Prince. The older more seasoned actors are stunning in this - Branagh and Thompson speak their lines as if it were plain modern English and bring it alive, Washington - always brilliant - is beautifully cast. Much has been made of Reeves playing the evil Don John woodenly but his aggressive and solid dark performance is a great foil for the light fluffy acting of everyone else and he's got Shakespeare lead experience up to his ears. I felt the weak performance was Robert Sean Leonard, and his eagerness was a little cringeworthy but he still played well in the ensemble. It has song and dance, is exuberant and jubilant, sexy, romantic funny and above all fun. Any time I watch it I feel so happy afterwards, the finale of the big wedding and dance. Great viewing. And, any womens' knees are sure to tremble at Washington's line, "Would you have me, lady?" or all the men coming riding over the hill... Wonderful film, lovely story and great performances. Laugh out loud humour, great musical score (the song "Pardon Goddess of the Night" is stunning) and flawless direction. Branagh is worth every award, as is Thompson - they were a formidable acting powerhouse couple.

    What a delightful film/play! It's both funny and dramatic and I thought that it was excellently cast. Kenneth Branaugh and Emma Thompson, in my eyes the King and Queen of Shakespeare, were a fabulous Benedick and Beatrice. A very young Kate Beckinsale was a lovely Hero, and Denzel Washington delighted me as Don Pedro, the Prince. I've never seen Much Ado About Nothing in play form before, but I thought it made for a wonderful film. One got to see the beautiful Italian countryside and villa where the play takes place. The costumes were simple but beautiful, and there was also a lovely incorporation of music and song into the scenes. There is nothing quite like live performance, which is what Shakespeare intended for his plays, yet I find that I appreciate all the possibilities that film presents.

    Having seen this film when it was released and having disliked it at the time, then watched it again recently, disliked it even more. The worst defect is the overacting. Emma Thompson is perfectly dreadful as she overdoes it in every scene she has; but the rest of the cast also overact, their facial expressions animated like some cartoon. They all mug to camera except Washington but his part is semi-regal. The less said about Michael Keaton's performance the better - it is comically rank. His accent is a bogus Irish stevedore stuck in Tuscany. The other annoying feature is the glued on grins and smiles as if this is a Carry On film. If only Sid James had appeared to add some class. And finally the music is a sticky overbearing aural goop that lacks nuance. Film music and Shakespeare are not good companions and in this case, to quote, 'The Tempest', "misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows." The play is one of Shakespeare's very best. It is the very first romantic comedy with ill-matched lovers who find love, but none of that brilliant sparring battle between Benedick and Beatrice is here.

    This is a movie I watch about once a year. The opening 10 minutes are worth it alone... Emma Thompson's lilting voice reading Shakespeare's verse "Hey Nonny Nonny" about philandering men against the backdrop of gorgeous Tuscany: the white bodices of the women, the red of the grapes and then the scene with the men riding in ... great movie making!! The banter between Benedick (Branagh) and Beatrice (Thompson) is perfect, I loved all the American actors, particularly Denzel Washington as the Prince and Keanu Reeves as the bastard brother.. they were both very good. I also really appreciate Branagh's interpretation of Shakespeare and his delivery.. and the way he encourages the ensemble to deliver Shakespeare, so much more real than the awkward Shakespeare delivery of old. With any Shakespeare piece, you know the story has to be excellent and Much Ado About Nothing is no exception. This is a wonderful romp through the countryside of Tuscany, the music is very good, there are some hilarious scenes and the costumes are just magical. My teenage daughters love it too and I have introduced this movie to teenagers and young people not "into" Shakespeare and they all loved it. 10 stars. This movie will last.

    If I were to vote, this movie just solely based on him it would have been a ten, but then the others were involved so it became so. When I read Much Ado About Nothing, I wasn't expecting Dogberry to be this zany. It was a real laugh watching Michael Keaton perform. That is, I'm praising him of his splendid role-playing. Michael Keaton's acting was really entertaining to say the least. Except for Benedick, out of all the characters I was mostly drawn to him for the way he portrayed Dogberry. Not having known that he played as Batman and just remembered him as the father of Lindsay Lohan in Herbie. I was fully impressed! If you want to see Michael Keaton acting a crazier side, see this film. It's a pity that he came out in just 4 scenes.

    Soooo This is a great movie. Mainly just due to the cast, more so the outstanding cast doing Shakespeare: Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Kate Beckinsale, Emma Thompson, Michael Keaton (essentially playing Beetle Juice all over again in Shakespeare)... Denzel is actually really good in Shakespeare so is Emma Thompson (obviously). But that's not what makes this movie great. It's freaking Keanu and Robert Sean Leonard (aka Wilson from House). Robert is actually pretty great. But it's so funny watching Wilson rattling off Shakespeare with such passion, trotting along side Denzel and Keanu in great outfit. And also shoving down Kate Beckinsale. Also Keanu chuckling manically but really poorly is great. Just look at the movie poster and one could completely understand. It's essentially Shakespeare made movies at its best. Thrilling, somewhat random, but the most entertaining modern interpretation of Shakespeare. SO HEY Nonny, nonny, nonny

This is a wonderful romp through the countryside of Tuscany, the music is very good, there are some hilarious scenes and the costumes are just magical. My teenage daughters love it too and I have introduced this movie to teenagers and young people not "into" Shakespeare and they all loved it. 10 stars. This movie will last.

    If I were to vote, this movie just solely based on him it would have been a ten, but then the others were involved so it became so. When I read Much Ado About Nothing, I wasn't expecting Dogberry to be this zany. It was a real laugh watching Michael Keaton perform. That is, I'm praising him of his splendid role-playing. Michael Keaton's acting was really entertaining to say the least. Except for Benedick, out of all the characters I was mostly drawn to him for the way he portrayed Dogberry. Not having known that he played as Batman and just remembered him as the father of Lindsay Lohan in Herbie. I was fully impressed! If you want to see Michael Keaton acting a crazier side, see this film. It's a pity that he came out in just 4 scenes.

    Soooo This is a great movie. Mainly just due to the cast, more so the outstanding cast doing Shakespeare: Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Kate Beckinsale, Emma Thompson, Michael Keaton (essentially playing Beetle Juice all over again in Shakespeare)... Denzel is actually really good in Shakespeare so is Emma Thompson (obviously). But that's not what makes this movie great. It's freaking Keanu and Robert Sean Leonard (aka Wilson from House). Robert is actually pretty great. But it's so funny watching Wilson rattling off Shakespeare with such passion, trotting along side Denzel and Keanu in great outfit. And also shoving down Kate Beckinsale. Also Keanu chuckling manically but really poorly is great. Just look at the movie poster and one could completely understand. It's essentially Shakespeare made movies at its best. Thrilling, somewhat random, but the most entertaining modern interpretation of Shakespeare. SO HEY Nonny, nonny, nonny

    Whether you enjoy it or not, it is a solid fact that William Shakespeare was one of the best, if not the best, writer of all time. His tragedies and comedies set so many milestones in storytelling, and have continued to influence all creative mediums today, including film. The man obviously had an influence on Kenneth Branagh, the director of Much Ado About Nothing. This film is one of five Shakespeare film adaptations that Branagh has directed. It is about two lovers, Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) and Hero (Kate Beckinsale) who are to be married in one week. To pass the time they devise a "love trap" for two of their family members. One is an arrogant and yet bumbling bachelor named Benedict (Kenneth Branagh) and the other is the strong willed and witty Beatrice (Emma Thompson). But in the midst of it all a man by the name of Don Jon (Keanu Reeves) conspires to stop the wedding. Overall the film is lighthearted, simple, and fun. However, it retains a much more sophisticated eloquence that definitely sets it apart from other films equally as lighthearted as it. When you're script is a word for word adaptation of the Shakespeare play, it is obvious you are going to have a fantastic story with great dialouge. There is just no denying that Shakespeare was a genius and comparatively had hardly any flaws in his work. The trick for a film adaptation of his play is to provide excellent visual aesthetics that will match the eloquence of the script. Branagh hits his mark excellently here. The film is something beautiful to look at. In every shot and every location it is obvious a lot of care and attention was put into making this film look as pretty as it sounds. The sets are beautifully designed, as well as the costumes which are all very consistent and fitting for the medieval time period. Branagh's direction is also top notch and he excels at being able to transform a script written for the stage into a very full on-screen experience. Branagh makes sure to put a lot of emphasis on the actors, since the characters are where the central focus of this story lies. But when he is not honing in on his actors he is utilizing fantastic tracking shots that show off the gorgeous sets and artistic design that went into them. The visual and audible aspects of this film thankfully lock together perfectly. As I said before there is a lot of emphasis on the actors in this film, and while the majority of the acting is well above par, there is a noticeable issue with it overall, but it is something almost out of the directors control. Shakespeare is not easy to act believably. The kind of acting necessary to make Shakespeare feel real as opposed to cheesy is in a league of its own. It has a lot to do with the dialect and style in which his work is written, which is obviously hundreds of years old and far different from how we speak today. It is because of this extremely specific acting style the actors must utilize to pull off these characters that we see a differentiation in the acting ability of the cast. In other words, we can tell who is a well versed Shakespearian actor and who is not. Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson are the shining stars of this film and it is very obvious that this style of acting is their field of expertise. It is a place where they feel comfortable and can truly act the part without forcing it in the Shakespearian dialect. Then we have other actors like Robert Sean Leonard and Denzel Washington who, despite being great in this film, are not actors of the same caliber when it comes to Shakespeare. I just couldn't believe Leonard and Washington as much as I did Branagh and Thompson, but it certainly doesn't mean they weren't very good in the film. And then of course at the bottom of the barrel we have Keanu Reeves who I won't even get started on. All I will say is that watching Reeves try to act Shakespeare is a painful experience. Much Ado About Nothing is definitely a very good film. It is very well made and, for the most part, very well acted. Watching a movie directly adapted from a Shakespeare play without removing any of the dialect of the time period is a breath of fresh air from your typical 21st century writing style. Now I will say on a more personal note that the story in Much Ado About Nothing, while very well written, is not exactly my cup of tea. Shakespeare only wrote in two genres... tragedy, and comedy. Much Ado About Nothing is one of the latter, so obviously it is very happy-go-lucky. My personal taste leans towards the darker tragedies that Shakespeare wrote, so I personally would recommend one of those before Much Ado About Nothing, but the film, for what it is, is still very good.

    Actually I've always been a fan of Shakespeare, but this movie took it to a whole new level. I found this quite by accident (flipping through channels and stopping when I wondered what were Denzel Washington AND Robert Sean Leonard doing in the same flick) On the whole, what I love about this movie is how natural the dialogue and setting are; none of the stilted portrayals I've come to associate with Shakespeare. For me, the biggest treat in this movie is basically any scene with Branagh and Thompson. Branagh IS Benedick, with all of his arrogance, bravado and chivalry. Thompson plays a beautiful and fiery Beatrice, and brings across the most believable portrayal I've seen of a Shakespeare heroine. Beckinsale and Leonard do a good job as Hero and Claudio. Although I know that Leonard gets some flak for his acting here, I think he brings across the impulsive and rash nature of his character well enough. Keaton and Washington are okay in their roles; I didn't find Keaton that distracting as Dogberry. Reeves could have done a little better in fleshing out his character--he's the reason for the 9/10 here.

    I loved this movie when it first came out 20 years ago and I think mostly cause I had such a crush on Robert Sean Leonard. I didn't get a lot of the story line or humor it when I was younger. I was only 9 when it came to theaters. I now own the movie and just recently saw it again. I hadn't seen it in a long time. Now I can't seem to get enough of it. I fell in love with the movie all over again. This time for other reasons like the plot and humor of it. The acting is superb by all. My favorite is no longer Claudio but Bennedick and then Beatrice. I think they had the most chemistry between them. It helps that the actors were married to each other at the time. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I highly recommend you rent it and see it.

    This is based on a classic William Shakespeare's play. Which is a comedy that revolves around two relationships and finding love. One is the two older quick witted, fiery and experienced characters that doesn't admit to their feelings for one another. Because of pride and that tug and pull game. And the other is two love birds that blossom with attraction and romantic feelings for one another. And a villain that is trying to scheme and manipulate the situation. I personally thought this film actually did a good job of keeping up with the spirit and essence of the William Shakespeare's play. And all the actors and actresses did a good job. Especially Denzel Washington who owns his role with ease and without much forced effort. The young Kate Beckinsale is also in this and all I can say is, she looks better as she ages...For now at least. Personally I thought Keanu Reeves did a fine job playing the villain. Except maybe the part where he gives a villainous laugh. This is Shakespeare's play done well, and if your one of the audiences that enjoy Shakespeare's work. There is a high chance you won't be disappointed with this one. 8.2/10

    One of Shakespeare's greatest romantic comedies, adapted and Directed by one of Shakespeare's greatest aficionados, Mr Kenneth Branagh, this film is brilliant. The ensemble cast make the film a wonderful viewing experience; Richard Briars, Brian Blessed, Kate Beckinsale, Robert Sean Leonard, Keanu Reeves, Emma Thompson, Imelda Staunton, Denzel Washington and Michael Keaton to name a few. It is filmed simply, as a costume drama, making the most of a country house and gardens in Messina, Sicily. The comedy is played up - especially brilliant by the greasy Keaton as the over-eager Constable Dogberry, Branagh and Thompson and the trick that is thought up by Denzel Washington's Prince. The older more seasoned actors are stunning in this - Branagh and Thompson speak their lines as if it were plain modern English and bring it alive, Washington - always brilliant - is beautifully cast. Much has been made of Reeves playing the evil Don John woodenly but his aggressive and solid dark performance is a great foil for the light fluffy acting of everyone else and he's got Shakespeare lead experience up to his ears. I felt the weak performance was Robert Sean Leonard, and his eagerness was a little cringeworthy but he still played well in the ensemble. It has song and dance, is exuberant and jubilant, sexy, romantic funny and above all fun. Any time I watch it I feel so happy afterwards, the finale of the big wedding and dance. Great viewing. And, any womens' knees are sure to tremble at Washington's line, "Would you have me, lady?" or all the men coming riding over the hill... Wonderful film, lovely story and great performances. Laugh out loud humour, great musical score (the song "Pardon Goddess of the Night" is stunning) and flawless direction. Branagh is worth every award, as is Thompson - they were a formidable acting powerhouse couple.

    What a delightful film/play! It's both funny and dramatic and I thought that it was excellently cast. Kenneth Branaugh and Emma Thompson, in my eyes the King and Queen of Shakespeare, were a fabulous Benedick and Beatrice. A very young Kate Beckinsale was a lovely Hero, and Denzel Washington delighted me as Don Pedro, the Prince. I've never seen Much Ado About Nothing in play form before, but I thought it made for a wonderful film. One got to see the beautiful Italian countryside and villa where the play takes place. The costumes were simple but beautiful, and there was also a lovely incorporation of music and song into the scenes. There is nothing quite like live performance, which is what Shakespeare intended for his plays, yet I find that I appreciate all the possibilities that film presents.

    Having seen this film when it was released and having disliked it at the time, then watched it again recently, disliked it even more. The worst defect is the overacting. Emma Thompson is perfectly dreadful as she overdoes it in every scene she has; but the rest of the cast also overact, their facial expressions animated like some cartoon. They all mug to camera except Washington but his part is semi-regal. The less said about Michael Keaton's performance the better - it is comically rank. His accent is a bogus Irish stevedore stuck in Tuscany. The other annoying feature is the glued on grins and smiles as if this is a Carry On film. If only Sid James had appeared to add some class. And finally the music is a sticky overbearing aural goop that lacks nuance. Film music and Shakespeare are not good companions and in this case, to quote, 'The Tempest', "misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows." The play is one of Shakespeare's very best. It is the very first romantic comedy with ill-matched lovers who find love, but none of that brilliant sparring battle between Benedick and Beatrice is here.

    This is a movie I watch about once a year. The opening 10 minutes are worth it alone... Emma Thompson's lilting voice reading Shakespeare's verse "Hey Nonny Nonny" about philandering men against the backdrop of gorgeous Tuscany: the white bodices of the women, the red of the grapes and then the scene with the men riding in ... great movie making!! The banter between Benedick (Branagh) and Beatrice (Thompson) is perfect, I loved all the American actors, particularly Denzel Washington as the Prince and Keanu Reeves as the bastard brother.. they were both very good. I also really appreciate Branagh's interpretation of Shakespeare and his delivery.. and the way he encourages the ensemble to deliver Shakespeare, so much more real than the awkward Shakespeare delivery of old. With any Shakespeare piece, you know the story has to be excellent and Much Ado About Nothing is no exception. This is a wonderful romp through the countryside of Tuscany, the music is very good, there are some hilarious scenes and the costumes are just magical. My teenage daughters love it too and I have introduced this movie to teenagers and young people not "into" Shakespeare and they all loved it. 10 stars. This movie will last.

Michael Keaton's acting was really entertaining to say the least. Except for Benedick, out of all the characters I was mostly drawn to him for the way he portrayed Dogberry.

If you want to see Michael Keaton acting a crazier side, see this film. It's a pity that he came out in just 4 scenes.

    Having seen this film when it was released and having disliked it at the time, then watched it again recently, disliked it even more. The worst defect is the overacting. Emma Thompson is perfectly dreadful as she overdoes it in every scene she has; but the rest of the cast also overact, their facial expressions animated like some cartoon. They all mug to camera except Washington but his part is semi-regal. The less said about Michael Keaton's performance the better - it is comically rank. His accent is a bogus Irish stevedore stuck in Tuscany. The other annoying feature is the glued on grins and smiles as if this is a Carry On film. If only Sid James had appeared to add some class. And finally the music is a sticky overbearing aural goop that lacks nuance. Film music and Shakespeare are not good companions and in this case, to quote, 'The Tempest', "misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows." The play is one of Shakespeare's very best. It is the very first romantic comedy with ill-matched lovers who find love, but none of that brilliant sparring battle between Benedick and Beatrice is here.

    This is a movie I watch about once a year. The opening 10 minutes are worth it alone... Emma Thompson's lilting voice reading Shakespeare's verse "Hey Nonny Nonny" about philandering men against the backdrop of gorgeous Tuscany: the white bodices of the women, the red of the grapes and then the scene with the men riding in ... great movie making!! The banter between Benedick (Branagh) and Beatrice (Thompson) is perfect, I loved all the American actors, particularly Denzel Washington as the Prince and Keanu Reeves as the bastard brother.. they were both very good. I also really appreciate Branagh's interpretation of Shakespeare and his delivery.. and the way he encourages the ensemble to deliver Shakespeare, so much more real than the awkward Shakespeare delivery of old. With any Shakespeare piece, you know the story has to be excellent and Much Ado About Nothing is no exception. This is a wonderful romp through the countryside of Tuscany, the music is very good, there are some hilarious scenes and the costumes are just magical. My teenage daughters love it too and I have introduced this movie to teenagers and young people not "into" Shakespeare and they all loved it. 10 stars. This movie will last.

    If I were to vote, this movie just solely based on him it would have been a ten, but then the others were involved so it became so. When I read Much Ado About Nothing, I wasn't expecting Dogberry to be this zany. It was a real laugh watching Michael Keaton perform. That is, I'm praising him of his splendid role-playing. Michael Keaton's acting was really entertaining to say the least. Except for Benedick, out of all the characters I was mostly drawn to him for the way he portrayed Dogberry. Not having known that he played as Batman and just remembered him as the father of Lindsay Lohan in Herbie. I was fully impressed! If you want to see Michael Keaton acting a crazier side, see this film. It's a pity that he came out in just 4 scenes.

    Soooo This is a great movie. Mainly just due to the cast, more so the outstanding cast doing Shakespeare: Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Kate Beckinsale, Emma Thompson, Michael Keaton (essentially playing Beetle Juice all over again in Shakespeare)... Denzel is actually really good in Shakespeare so is Emma Thompson (obviously). But that's not what makes this movie great. It's freaking Keanu and Robert Sean Leonard (aka Wilson from House). Robert is actually pretty great. But it's so funny watching Wilson rattling off Shakespeare with such passion, trotting along side Denzel and Keanu in great outfit. And also shoving down Kate Beckinsale. Also Keanu chuckling manically but really poorly is great. Just look at the movie poster and one could completely understand. It's essentially Shakespeare made movies at its best. Thrilling, somewhat random, but the most entertaining modern interpretation of Shakespeare. SO HEY Nonny, nonny, nonny

    Whether you enjoy it or not, it is a solid fact that William Shakespeare was one of the best, if not the best, writer of all time. His tragedies and comedies set so many milestones in storytelling, and have continued to influence all creative mediums today, including film. The man obviously had an influence on Kenneth Branagh, the director of Much Ado About Nothing. This film is one of five Shakespeare film adaptations that Branagh has directed. It is about two lovers, Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) and Hero (Kate Beckinsale) who are to be married in one week. To pass the time they devise a "love trap" for two of their family members. One is an arrogant and yet bumbling bachelor named Benedict (Kenneth Branagh) and the other is the strong willed and witty Beatrice (Emma Thompson). But in the midst of it all a man by the name of Don Jon (Keanu Reeves) conspires to stop the wedding. Overall the film is lighthearted, simple, and fun. However, it retains a much more sophisticated eloquence that definitely sets it apart from other films equally as lighthearted as it. When you're script is a word for word adaptation of the Shakespeare play, it is obvious you are going to have a fantastic story with great dialouge. There is just no denying that Shakespeare was a genius and comparatively had hardly any flaws in his work. The trick for a film adaptation of his play is to provide excellent visual aesthetics that will match the eloquence of the script. Branagh hits his mark excellently here. The film is something beautiful to look at. In every shot and every location it is obvious a lot of care and attention was put into making this film look as pretty as it sounds. The sets are beautifully designed, as well as the costumes which are all very consistent and fitting for the medieval time period. Branagh's direction is also top notch and he excels at being able to transform a script written for the stage into a very full on-screen experience. Branagh makes sure to put a lot of emphasis on the actors, since the characters are where the central focus of this story lies. But when he is not honing in on his actors he is utilizing fantastic tracking shots that show off the gorgeous sets and artistic design that went into them. The visual and audible aspects of this film thankfully lock together perfectly. As I said before there is a lot of emphasis on the actors in this film, and while the majority of the acting is well above par, there is a noticeable issue with it overall, but it is something almost out of the directors control. Shakespeare is not easy to act believably. The kind of acting necessary to make Shakespeare feel real as opposed to cheesy is in a league of its own. It has a lot to do with the dialect and style in which his work is written, which is obviously hundreds of years old and far different from how we speak today. It is because of this extremely specific acting style the actors must utilize to pull off these characters that we see a differentiation in the acting ability of the cast. In other words, we can tell who is a well versed Shakespearian actor and who is not. Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson are the shining stars of this film and it is very obvious that this style of acting is their field of expertise. It is a place where they feel comfortable and can truly act the part without forcing it in the Shakespearian dialect. Then we have other actors like Robert Sean Leonard and Denzel Washington who, despite being great in this film, are not actors of the same caliber when it comes to Shakespeare. I just couldn't believe Leonard and Washington as much as I did Branagh and Thompson, but it certainly doesn't mean they weren't very good in the film. And then of course at the bottom of the barrel we have Keanu Reeves who I won't even get started on. All I will say is that watching Reeves try to act Shakespeare is a painful experience. Much Ado About Nothing is definitely a very good film. It is very well made and, for the most part, very well acted. Watching a movie directly adapted from a Shakespeare play without removing any of the dialect of the time period is a breath of fresh air from your typical 21st century writing style. Now I will say on a more personal note that the story in Much Ado About Nothing, while very well written, is not exactly my cup of tea. Shakespeare only wrote in two genres... tragedy, and comedy. Much Ado About Nothing is one of the latter, so obviously it is very happy-go-lucky. My personal taste leans towards the darker tragedies that Shakespeare wrote, so I personally would recommend one of those before Much Ado About Nothing, but the film, for what it is, is still very good.

    Actually I've always been a fan of Shakespeare, but this movie took it to a whole new level. I found this quite by accident (flipping through channels and stopping when I wondered what were Denzel Washington AND Robert Sean Leonard doing in the same flick) On the whole, what I love about this movie is how natural the dialogue and setting are; none of the stilted portrayals I've come to associate with Shakespeare. For me, the biggest treat in this movie is basically any scene with Branagh and Thompson. Branagh IS Benedick, with all of his arrogance, bravado and chivalry. Thompson plays a beautiful and fiery Beatrice, and brings across the most believable portrayal I've seen of a Shakespeare heroine. Beckinsale and Leonard do a good job as Hero and Claudio. Although I know that Leonard gets some flak for his acting here, I think he brings across the impulsive and rash nature of his character well enough. Keaton and Washington are okay in their roles; I didn't find Keaton that distracting as Dogberry. Reeves could have done a little better in fleshing out his character--he's the reason for the 9/10 here.

    I loved this movie when it first came out 20 years ago and I think mostly cause I had such a crush on Robert Sean Leonard. I didn't get a lot of the story line or humor it when I was younger. I was only 9 when it came to theaters. I now own the movie and just recently saw it again. I hadn't seen it in a long time. Now I can't seem to get enough of it. I fell in love with the movie all over again. This time for other reasons like the plot and humor of it. The acting is superb by all. My favorite is no longer Claudio but Bennedick and then Beatrice. I think they had the most chemistry between them. It helps that the actors were married to each other at the time. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I highly recommend you rent it and see it.

    This is based on a classic William Shakespeare's play. Which is a comedy that revolves around two relationships and finding love. One is the two older quick witted, fiery and experienced characters that doesn't admit to their feelings for one another. Because of pride and that tug and pull game. And the other is two love birds that blossom with attraction and romantic feelings for one another. And a villain that is trying to scheme and manipulate the situation. I personally thought this film actually did a good job of keeping up with the spirit and essence of the William Shakespeare's play. And all the actors and actresses did a good job. Especially Denzel Washington who owns his role with ease and without much forced effort. The young Kate Beckinsale is also in this and all I can say is, she looks better as she ages...For now at least. Personally I thought Keanu Reeves did a fine job playing the villain. Except maybe the part where he gives a villainous laugh. This is Shakespeare's play done well, and if your one of the audiences that enjoy Shakespeare's work. There is a high chance you won't be disappointed with this one. 8.2/10

    One of Shakespeare's greatest romantic comedies, adapted and Directed by one of Shakespeare's greatest aficionados, Mr Kenneth Branagh, this film is brilliant. The ensemble cast make the film a wonderful viewing experience; Richard Briars, Brian Blessed, Kate Beckinsale, Robert Sean Leonard, Keanu Reeves, Emma Thompson, Imelda Staunton, Denzel Washington and Michael Keaton to name a few. It is filmed simply, as a costume drama, making the most of a country house and gardens in Messina, Sicily. The comedy is played up - especially brilliant by the greasy Keaton as the over-eager Constable Dogberry, Branagh and Thompson and the trick that is thought up by Denzel Washington's Prince. The older more seasoned actors are stunning in this - Branagh and Thompson speak their lines as if it were plain modern English and bring it alive, Washington - always brilliant - is beautifully cast. Much has been made of Reeves playing the evil Don John woodenly but his aggressive and solid dark performance is a great foil for the light fluffy acting of everyone else and he's got Shakespeare lead experience up to his ears. I felt the weak performance was Robert Sean Leonard, and his eagerness was a little cringeworthy but he still played well in the ensemble. It has song and dance, is exuberant and jubilant, sexy, romantic funny and above all fun. Any time I watch it I feel so happy afterwards, the finale of the big wedding and dance. Great viewing. And, any womens' knees are sure to tremble at Washington's line, "Would you have me, lady?" or all the men coming riding over the hill... Wonderful film, lovely story and great performances. Laugh out loud humour, great musical score (the song "Pardon Goddess of the Night" is stunning) and flawless direction. Branagh is worth every award, as is Thompson - they were a formidable acting powerhouse couple.

    What a delightful film/play! It's both funny and dramatic and I thought that it was excellently cast. Kenneth Branaugh and Emma Thompson, in my eyes the King and Queen of Shakespeare, were a fabulous Benedick and Beatrice. A very young Kate Beckinsale was a lovely Hero, and Denzel Washington delighted me as Don Pedro, the Prince. I've never seen Much Ado About Nothing in play form before, but I thought it made for a wonderful film. One got to see the beautiful Italian countryside and villa where the play takes place. The costumes were simple but beautiful, and there was also a lovely incorporation of music and song into the scenes. There is nothing quite like live performance, which is what Shakespeare intended for his plays, yet I find that I appreciate all the possibilities that film presents.

    Having seen this film when it was released and having disliked it at the time, then watched it again recently, disliked it even more. The worst defect is the overacting. Emma Thompson is perfectly dreadful as she overdoes it in every scene she has; but the rest of the cast also overact, their facial expressions animated like some cartoon. They all mug to camera except Washington but his part is semi-regal. The less said about Michael Keaton's performance the better - it is comically rank. His accent is a bogus Irish stevedore stuck in Tuscany. The other annoying feature is the glued on grins and smiles as if this is a Carry On film. If only Sid James had appeared to add some class. And finally the music is a sticky overbearing aural goop that lacks nuance. Film music and Shakespeare are not good companions and in this case, to quote, 'The Tempest', "misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows." The play is one of Shakespeare's very best. It is the very first romantic comedy with ill-matched lovers who find love, but none of that brilliant sparring battle between Benedick and Beatrice is here.

It has song and dance, is exuberant and jubilant, sexy, romantic funny and above all fun. Any time I watch it I feel so happy afterwards, the finale of the big wedding and dance. Great viewing. And, any womens' knees are sure to tremble at Washington's line, "Would you have me, lady?" or all the men coming riding over the hill... Wonderful film, lovely story and great performances. Laugh out loud humour, great musical score (the song "Pardon Goddess of the Night" is stunning) and flawless direction. Branagh is worth every award, as is Thompson - they were a formidable acting powerhouse couple.

    What a delightful film/play! It's both funny and dramatic and I thought that it was excellently cast. Kenneth Branaugh and Emma Thompson, in my eyes the King and Queen of Shakespeare, were a fabulous Benedick and Beatrice. A very young Kate Beckinsale was a lovely Hero, and Denzel Washington delighted me as Don Pedro, the Prince. I've never seen Much Ado About Nothing in play form before, but I thought it made for a wonderful film. One got to see the beautiful Italian countryside and villa where the play takes place. The costumes were simple but beautiful, and there was also a lovely incorporation of music and song into the scenes. There is nothing quite like live performance, which is what Shakespeare intended for his plays, yet I find that I appreciate all the possibilities that film presents.

    Having seen this film when it was released and having disliked it at the time, then watched it again recently, disliked it even more. The worst defect is the overacting. Emma Thompson is perfectly dreadful as she overdoes it in every scene she has; but the rest of the cast also overact, their facial expressions animated like some cartoon. They all mug to camera except Washington but his part is semi-regal. The less said about Michael Keaton's performance the better - it is comically rank. His accent is a bogus Irish stevedore stuck in Tuscany. The other annoying feature is the glued on grins and smiles as if this is a Carry On film. If only Sid James had appeared to add some class. And finally the music is a sticky overbearing aural goop that lacks nuance. Film music and Shakespeare are not good companions and in this case, to quote, 'The Tempest', "misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows." The play is one of Shakespeare's very best. It is the very first romantic comedy with ill-matched lovers who find love, but none of that brilliant sparring battle between Benedick and Beatrice is here.

    This is a movie I watch about once a year. The opening 10 minutes are worth it alone... Emma Thompson's lilting voice reading Shakespeare's verse "Hey Nonny Nonny" about philandering men against the backdrop of gorgeous Tuscany: the white bodices of the women, the red of the grapes and then the scene with the men riding in ... great movie making!! The banter between Benedick (Branagh) and Beatrice (Thompson) is perfect, I loved all the American actors, particularly Denzel Washington as the Prince and Keanu Reeves as the bastard brother.. they were both very good. I also really appreciate Branagh's interpretation of Shakespeare and his delivery.. and the way he encourages the ensemble to deliver Shakespeare, so much more real than the awkward Shakespeare delivery of old. With any Shakespeare piece, you know the story has to be excellent and Much Ado About Nothing is no exception. This is a wonderful romp through the countryside of Tuscany, the music is very good, there are some hilarious scenes and the costumes are just magical. My teenage daughters love it too and I have introduced this movie to teenagers and young people not "into" Shakespeare and they all loved it. 10 stars. This movie will last.

    If I were to vote, this movie just solely based on him it would have been a ten, but then the others were involved so it became so. When I read Much Ado About Nothing, I wasn't expecting Dogberry to be this zany. It was a real laugh watching Michael Keaton perform. That is, I'm praising him of his splendid role-playing. Michael Keaton's acting was really entertaining to say the least. Except for Benedick, out of all the characters I was mostly drawn to him for the way he portrayed Dogberry. Not having known that he played as Batman and just remembered him as the father of Lindsay Lohan in Herbie. I was fully impressed! If you want to see Michael Keaton acting a crazier side, see this film. It's a pity that he came out in just 4 scenes.

    Soooo This is a great movie. Mainly just due to the cast, more so the outstanding cast doing Shakespeare: Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Kate Beckinsale, Emma Thompson, Michael Keaton (essentially playing Beetle Juice all over again in Shakespeare)... Denzel is actually really good in Shakespeare so is Emma Thompson (obviously). But that's not what makes this movie great. It's freaking Keanu and Robert Sean Leonard (aka Wilson from House). Robert is actually pretty great. But it's so funny watching Wilson rattling off Shakespeare with such passion, trotting along side Denzel and Keanu in great outfit. And also shoving down Kate Beckinsale. Also Keanu chuckling manically but really poorly is great. Just look at the movie poster and one could completely understand. It's essentially Shakespeare made movies at its best. Thrilling, somewhat random, but the most entertaining modern interpretation of Shakespeare. SO HEY Nonny, nonny, nonny

    Whether you enjoy it or not, it is a solid fact that William Shakespeare was one of the best, if not the best, writer of all time. His tragedies and comedies set so many milestones in storytelling, and have continued to influence all creative mediums today, including film. The man obviously had an influence on Kenneth Branagh, the director of Much Ado About Nothing. This film is one of five Shakespeare film adaptations that Branagh has directed. It is about two lovers, Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) and Hero (Kate Beckinsale) who are to be married in one week. To pass the time they devise a "love trap" for two of their family members. One is an arrogant and yet bumbling bachelor named Benedict (Kenneth Branagh) and the other is the strong willed and witty Beatrice (Emma Thompson). But in the midst of it all a man by the name of Don Jon (Keanu Reeves) conspires to stop the wedding. Overall the film is lighthearted, simple, and fun. However, it retains a much more sophisticated eloquence that definitely sets it apart from other films equally as lighthearted as it. When you're script is a word for word adaptation of the Shakespeare play, it is obvious you are going to have a fantastic story with great dialouge. There is just no denying that Shakespeare was a genius and comparatively had hardly any flaws in his work. The trick for a film adaptation of his play is to provide excellent visual aesthetics that will match the eloquence of the script. Branagh hits his mark excellently here. The film is something beautiful to look at. In every shot and every location it is obvious a lot of care and attention was put into making this film look as pretty as it sounds. The sets are beautifully designed, as well as the costumes which are all very consistent and fitting for the medieval time period. Branagh's direction is also top notch and he excels at being able to transform a script written for the stage into a very full on-screen experience. Branagh makes sure to put a lot of emphasis on the actors, since the characters are where the central focus of this story lies. But when he is not honing in on his actors he is utilizing fantastic tracking shots that show off the gorgeous sets and artistic design that went into them. The visual and audible aspects of this film thankfully lock together perfectly. As I said before there is a lot of emphasis on the actors in this film, and while the majority of the acting is well above par, there is a noticeable issue with it overall, but it is something almost out of the directors control. Shakespeare is not easy to act believably. The kind of acting necessary to make Shakespeare feel real as opposed to cheesy is in a league of its own. It has a lot to do with the dialect and style in which his work is written, which is obviously hundreds of years old and far different from how we speak today. It is because of this extremely specific acting style the actors must utilize to pull off these characters that we see a differentiation in the acting ability of the cast. In other words, we can tell who is a well versed Shakespearian actor and who is not. Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson are the shining stars of this film and it is very obvious that this style of acting is their field of expertise. It is a place where they feel comfortable and can truly act the part without forcing it in the Shakespearian dialect. Then we have other actors like Robert Sean Leonard and Denzel Washington who, despite being great in this film, are not actors of the same caliber when it comes to Shakespeare. I just couldn't believe Leonard and Washington as much as I did Branagh and Thompson, but it certainly doesn't mean they weren't very good in the film. And then of course at the bottom of the barrel we have Keanu Reeves who I won't even get started on. All I will say is that watching Reeves try to act Shakespeare is a painful experience. Much Ado About Nothing is definitely a very good film. It is very well made and, for the most part, very well acted. Watching a movie directly adapted from a Shakespeare play without removing any of the dialect of the time period is a breath of fresh air from your typical 21st century writing style. Now I will say on a more personal note that the story in Much Ado About Nothing, while very well written, is not exactly my cup of tea. Shakespeare only wrote in two genres... tragedy, and comedy. Much Ado About Nothing is one of the latter, so obviously it is very happy-go-lucky. My personal taste leans towards the darker tragedies that Shakespeare wrote, so I personally would recommend one of those before Much Ado About Nothing, but the film, for what it is, is still very good.

    Actually I've always been a fan of Shakespeare, but this movie took it to a whole new level. I found this quite by accident (flipping through channels and stopping when I wondered what were Denzel Washington AND Robert Sean Leonard doing in the same flick) On the whole, what I love about this movie is how natural the dialogue and setting are; none of the stilted portrayals I've come to associate with Shakespeare. For me, the biggest treat in this movie is basically any scene with Branagh and Thompson. Branagh IS Benedick, with all of his arrogance, bravado and chivalry. Thompson plays a beautiful and fiery Beatrice, and brings across the most believable portrayal I've seen of a Shakespeare heroine. Beckinsale and Leonard do a good job as Hero and Claudio. Although I know that Leonard gets some flak for his acting here, I think he brings across the impulsive and rash nature of his character well enough. Keaton and Washington are okay in their roles; I didn't find Keaton that distracting as Dogberry. Reeves could have done a little better in fleshing out his character--he's the reason for the 9/10 here.
