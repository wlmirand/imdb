    "French Twist" is a film that is full of surprises from the very beginning to the very end. A comedy made in France in 1995 gives us a plot that asks any man what he would do if his wife fell in love with a lesbian. The premise is hilarious and so is this movie. As a comedy it works very well. The characters, and their plights, are funny because the actors in this film give surprisingly good performances. Victoria Abril, who plays Loli the housewife, does a great job in giving such life to her character while bringing enough emotion to make such a ridiculous affair believable. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially Alain Chabat, who plays the husband. He's a scum, but at some point in the movie, Alain is able to turn his character around and make the audience feel his plight. Kudos should also be given to both the director and writer. Only a talented writer could forge a script that flies by quite smoothly regardless of its ridiculous premise and only a talented director could translate such a script onto the screen with few hiccups. On that note, I must say that I appreciate the pace of this movie the most. It lingers in the areas it should just long enough for the characters to develop before moving to the next plot twist. And boy, are there a bunch of those! Really, the pacing is what makes this movie such a joy to watch. Overall, "French Twist" is a very solid movie, and a really good comedy. If you have any interest in movies that stretch past sexual orientation or are just looking for some quality laughs, I highly recommend this.

    You'll never know when you will be in love with a person in the same sex. Thats what I thought about this movie. Marijo is obviously the kind of a lesbian that everyone knows about. Very stereotypical. But through her struggle to have her girl, and her desire to have a baby, it makes the audience want to relate to her. Which is a good thing. I am Japanese and don't really know about French people, but for me it was ridiculous to live with someone who you've just met. The issue was not really about the fact that Marijo was a lesbian, but the fact that Loli couldn't decide who she should be with. Well, its a comedy so it maybe works. Fun movie to watch with a lot of hilarious scenes, but I don't know if I have learned something from it.

    This movie might give a chance to reconstruct your ideas of gender roles and sexualities in a very French and really twisted way. Marijo, played by Josiane Balasko, appears as a woman with non-standard behavior, and without any question about sexuality of herself. In the way she acts, dress, and talk, you feel she has more attractive factors as a male than Laurant, played by Alain Chabat, does, with a common gender stereotype "females are attracted by reliable males caring only about them." The movie also succeeded showing a contrast between characters by showing Laurant, a straight-male, acts 'sissy' becoming emaciated while Marijo, a lesbian, always acts 'manly' whatever happens. This makes you laugh out so loud with a great fun at scenes that Laurant treats Marijo's lesbian friends (includes her ex.) nicely as guests. However, with a look from different side, it looks like the questioning general-gender stereotype in the society is not clearly put enough. All the events in relationships in characters are caused by fast, simple, unstable, and 'easy-going' attitudes about physical and mental relationships of Loli, played by Victoria Abril; therefore there is no end to the trouble no matter the sexuality of her partners.

    French Twist is a light comedy movie, which raise the issue of homosexuality to spectators. The story is about that Loli was not fully satisfied with her husband, Laurent. He is work at a local estate agency, and falling out of love enthusiasm to her. Then Loli met Marijo who is a lesbian happen to visit to her house, and have a relationship. Laurent try to get back Loli, but he goes irrational way. The story is good because the characters build a relationship with each other, which is nobody, wants to expect and see. This plot is not a typical holly wood model, so audience cannot foresee the story and the do not get bored. This movie includes a lot of sexual expressions. It's prohibited for teenagers to watch the naked or sexual expression in Japan and U.S., but this movie does not hide such kind of scenes. I'm not sure if this is the general in Europe, but they seem not to hesitate. Loli is described as an emotional woman. I guess she was frustrated by Laurent's attitude for women to woman because he had thought that women generally are obey men because man feed women, and should only house work and take care of children. A decade ago this thought is also taken it for granted in Japan. Her act reflect the women's frustration in this era, and she recharged by the way indirectly.

    French Twist is a 1995 French comedy film. I like the film because I personally love comedy movie. Also, it overthrow the past concept of gender relations movie. This film contrarily emphasize more about what characters' personalities have shifted during solving problems. The sexuality parts inside the movie are showed without covering. For example, there is one scene that parents kiss passionately in front of their children. European is more open with the sexuality than American or Asian because even six-year-old-child can watch it with accompanying parents or adult guardian . Therefore, I think the fans of the genre would be satisfied since it clearly shows the relationship of heterosexual and homosexual. The structure of the film is amazing since it is really difficult to predict the plots and the ending; thus, it would attracts audience to concentrate on it. Camera angle creates the mood of the scene. In a scene when Majiro first visit Loli's house, the camera focus on Majiro's chubby body first, and move to her face last. The director wants viewers to emphasis more on her body image in order to clearly show her differences from other standard women. This film support this kind of gender condition like lesbian. I think the movie tries to tell its audience that if people love each other, it is okay to be whether heterosexual or homosexual. Since I am a Asian, I was really shock and surprised after watched this movie. It displays the relationship of lesbian boldly which is really unusual in Asian country not to mention releasing in 1995. I've never have a chance to watch this kind of gender relation's movie because most of them are restricted. Therefore, I like this film since not only scenes and shots are good but also the concepts are amazing. I think the movie might be appealing for homosexual more.

    French Twist is a French comedy film in 1995. I enjoy watching the film, and I think some of the scenes in the films are innovative compare to similar films. The film deserved some of the award such as best actor and best director since the main characters acting is vivid and entertaining. The idea of the story is interesting and deep. I think the director have a unique way to show emotions between Marijo and Loli. There is one scene when Marijo and Loli taking bath together, and this scene reveals the intense love of lesbian. Also, Laurent's emotions and attitude towards Loli is quite complex after Marijo involve in their relationship. Especially when Laurent agree to have sex with Marijo while Loli is away, I think that scene is a little exaggerated and awkward. At that moment, I feel sympathy for Marijo because no matter how much she wanted to become a man, however, physically she cannot win Laurent. It shows that man and woman are still very different in many ways. Overall, this film is trying to tell audience that love does not against sex, and love is the most powerful thing in the world. Since this film is comedy, this gender issue is also interesting. I think this type movie will appeal both to heterosexual and homosexual.

    As a comedy, the film stands out as it blends in the sexuality and gender issues in. It portraits these relatively controversial issues in an explicit approach. It won Best Screenplay at the 1995 French Academy of Cinema and got nominated for Best Picturefor 1995 French Academy of Cinema and Best Foreign Language Film for 1995 Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Personally, I think this movie is a successful one in terms of the story plot. The story line is easy to follow and the editing style is just the right pace. Things do not get messed up even the relationship between the three is rather complicated. The scenes are nicely set up and every single scene contributes their importance to the whole film. Some may argue that such issue should not be shown in such explicit style, for instance, when Loli and Marijo were naked in the bath tube, at least it should not be rated "Universal" in Europe. However, we may have to refer back to the cultural context since it is rated differently in America. For European countries, it may be accepted to present controversial issues such as sexuality and lesbian relationships in a direct way compared to other countries such as the ones in Asia, where these are considered as taboos. Overall, I think this is an entertaining film and it is worth watching. This movie is recommended to anyone who wants to know more about gender and sexuality issues, or anyone above illegal age.

    French Twist is a sexual, yet also is a light romantic comedy film which shows the different aspects of gender roles and homosexuality which is not usually seen in a mainstream film. For people who has watch this kind of film for the first time, this could be really shocking yet interesting and humorous plot of story.This film, shows how it is possible for a person to just change their sexuality in just a matter of flirting with the same sex, or it could also be possible that their real sexuality was hidden inside them for a long time and was just discovered when the right situation happens that pushes their real sexuality to come out. It also showed the different personality that each gender has, in a very polite way though. On how Laurent criticizes Marijo because of her sexuality was not really super annoying, instead, all their clash scenes were very funny. The director successfully turned a supposedly intense scenario of a homosexual love triangle into a very humorous and light scene. This film really did a great job on making the audience nervous and excited for what is going to happen with the married couple when a third party started to show up in the picture. Over all I think that French Twist is a very unique film and will let the audience know that in love , gender doesn't matter.

    French twist is a lighthearted comedy which centers around three characters in a love triangle not often seen in mainstream film. When it was made in 1995, this film was very controversial in America due to the nature and portrayal of sexuality in the film. However it was accepted more openly in Europe at the time. Now however the film and its subject matter, while still controversial to a point, are much more accepted in America. The characters in the film are good. Not incredibly deep but they are not two dimensional. You do feel for them and care for their feelings. And the film does a good job of having you care for each of the characters at some point or another during the film so that it is hard to pick sides and root for a single character. This film does a good job a showing the double standards between woman and men. Furthermore being a comedy it makes it easier to take in the once "edgy" and still somewhat controversial subject matter of the film. The theme throughout the film is that of love. The film tries to show that love does not depend on one's sex but rather on the people themselves. This is made clear many times through the movie. The topic of the film may seem rather heavy but the director and actors do an excellent job of keeping the movie light and comedic. There are plenty of points throughout the movie that were both surprising and rather amusing. Overall I think that the movie is definitely worth watching. It is a funny comedy and it does make you think. If you like lighthearted comedies which are outside the norm, you will enjoy this movie.

    French Twist explores the sexual fluidity that people possess with an upbeat and fun nature. By categorizing the flow and charm of the film as a romantic/comedy, it draws and entertains the audience to a usually controversial and taboo topic, especially for American viewers. While covering the topics of gender roles and sexuality, it transcends and opens up these issues in a charming mood. Certain stereotypes for both genders are explored through the characters mainly of Loli and Laurent. Laurent as the cheating husband who is portrayed as emotionally distant from his wife. Loli as the ambitious housewife who seems to be dissatisfied with her life as one. Although stereotypes of Loli's role as a housewife seem to be something pushed to her rather than she deliberately or naturally takes advantage of like Laurent does. Although the character of Marijo is physically stereotyped as a butch lesbian, her relationship with Loli show a clear contrast between her relationship with her husband. The film succeeds in showing the dynamic, and in the end harmony between the three main characters. Although the course of events move faster than what the audience would expect, it adds up to and emphasizes the light hearted comedic theme. Over all this film covers many issues that conveys into a human drama that may or may not happen to some of us.

The topic of the film may seem rather heavy but the director and actors do an excellent job of keeping the movie light and comedic. There are plenty of points throughout the movie that were both surprising and rather amusing. Overall I think that the movie is definitely worth watching. It is a funny comedy and it does make you think. If you like lighthearted comedies which are outside the norm, you will enjoy this movie.

    French Twist explores the sexual fluidity that people possess with an upbeat and fun nature. By categorizing the flow and charm of the film as a romantic/comedy, it draws and entertains the audience to a usually controversial and taboo topic, especially for American viewers. While covering the topics of gender roles and sexuality, it transcends and opens up these issues in a charming mood. Certain stereotypes for both genders are explored through the characters mainly of Loli and Laurent. Laurent as the cheating husband who is portrayed as emotionally distant from his wife. Loli as the ambitious housewife who seems to be dissatisfied with her life as one. Although stereotypes of Loli's role as a housewife seem to be something pushed to her rather than she deliberately or naturally takes advantage of like Laurent does. Although the character of Marijo is physically stereotyped as a butch lesbian, her relationship with Loli show a clear contrast between her relationship with her husband. The film succeeds in showing the dynamic, and in the end harmony between the three main characters. Although the course of events move faster than what the audience would expect, it adds up to and emphasizes the light hearted comedic theme. Over all this film covers many issues that conveys into a human drama that may or may not happen to some of us.

    "French Twist" is a film that is full of surprises from the very beginning to the very end. A comedy made in France in 1995 gives us a plot that asks any man what he would do if his wife fell in love with a lesbian. The premise is hilarious and so is this movie. As a comedy it works very well. The characters, and their plights, are funny because the actors in this film give surprisingly good performances. Victoria Abril, who plays Loli the housewife, does a great job in giving such life to her character while bringing enough emotion to make such a ridiculous affair believable. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially Alain Chabat, who plays the husband. He's a scum, but at some point in the movie, Alain is able to turn his character around and make the audience feel his plight. Kudos should also be given to both the director and writer. Only a talented writer could forge a script that flies by quite smoothly regardless of its ridiculous premise and only a talented director could translate such a script onto the screen with few hiccups. On that note, I must say that I appreciate the pace of this movie the most. It lingers in the areas it should just long enough for the characters to develop before moving to the next plot twist. And boy, are there a bunch of those! Really, the pacing is what makes this movie such a joy to watch. Overall, "French Twist" is a very solid movie, and a really good comedy. If you have any interest in movies that stretch past sexual orientation or are just looking for some quality laughs, I highly recommend this.

    You'll never know when you will be in love with a person in the same sex. Thats what I thought about this movie. Marijo is obviously the kind of a lesbian that everyone knows about. Very stereotypical. But through her struggle to have her girl, and her desire to have a baby, it makes the audience want to relate to her. Which is a good thing. I am Japanese and don't really know about French people, but for me it was ridiculous to live with someone who you've just met. The issue was not really about the fact that Marijo was a lesbian, but the fact that Loli couldn't decide who she should be with. Well, its a comedy so it maybe works. Fun movie to watch with a lot of hilarious scenes, but I don't know if I have learned something from it.

    This movie might give a chance to reconstruct your ideas of gender roles and sexualities in a very French and really twisted way. Marijo, played by Josiane Balasko, appears as a woman with non-standard behavior, and without any question about sexuality of herself. In the way she acts, dress, and talk, you feel she has more attractive factors as a male than Laurant, played by Alain Chabat, does, with a common gender stereotype "females are attracted by reliable males caring only about them." The movie also succeeded showing a contrast between characters by showing Laurant, a straight-male, acts 'sissy' becoming emaciated while Marijo, a lesbian, always acts 'manly' whatever happens. This makes you laugh out so loud with a great fun at scenes that Laurant treats Marijo's lesbian friends (includes her ex.) nicely as guests. However, with a look from different side, it looks like the questioning general-gender stereotype in the society is not clearly put enough. All the events in relationships in characters are caused by fast, simple, unstable, and 'easy-going' attitudes about physical and mental relationships of Loli, played by Victoria Abril; therefore there is no end to the trouble no matter the sexuality of her partners.

    French Twist is a light comedy movie, which raise the issue of homosexuality to spectators. The story is about that Loli was not fully satisfied with her husband, Laurent. He is work at a local estate agency, and falling out of love enthusiasm to her. Then Loli met Marijo who is a lesbian happen to visit to her house, and have a relationship. Laurent try to get back Loli, but he goes irrational way. The story is good because the characters build a relationship with each other, which is nobody, wants to expect and see. This plot is not a typical holly wood model, so audience cannot foresee the story and the do not get bored. This movie includes a lot of sexual expressions. It's prohibited for teenagers to watch the naked or sexual expression in Japan and U.S., but this movie does not hide such kind of scenes. I'm not sure if this is the general in Europe, but they seem not to hesitate. Loli is described as an emotional woman. I guess she was frustrated by Laurent's attitude for women to woman because he had thought that women generally are obey men because man feed women, and should only house work and take care of children. A decade ago this thought is also taken it for granted in Japan. Her act reflect the women's frustration in this era, and she recharged by the way indirectly.

    French Twist is a 1995 French comedy film. I like the film because I personally love comedy movie. Also, it overthrow the past concept of gender relations movie. This film contrarily emphasize more about what characters' personalities have shifted during solving problems. The sexuality parts inside the movie are showed without covering. For example, there is one scene that parents kiss passionately in front of their children. European is more open with the sexuality than American or Asian because even six-year-old-child can watch it with accompanying parents or adult guardian . Therefore, I think the fans of the genre would be satisfied since it clearly shows the relationship of heterosexual and homosexual. The structure of the film is amazing since it is really difficult to predict the plots and the ending; thus, it would attracts audience to concentrate on it. Camera angle creates the mood of the scene. In a scene when Majiro first visit Loli's house, the camera focus on Majiro's chubby body first, and move to her face last. The director wants viewers to emphasis more on her body image in order to clearly show her differences from other standard women. This film support this kind of gender condition like lesbian. I think the movie tries to tell its audience that if people love each other, it is okay to be whether heterosexual or homosexual. Since I am a Asian, I was really shock and surprised after watched this movie. It displays the relationship of lesbian boldly which is really unusual in Asian country not to mention releasing in 1995. I've never have a chance to watch this kind of gender relation's movie because most of them are restricted. Therefore, I like this film since not only scenes and shots are good but also the concepts are amazing. I think the movie might be appealing for homosexual more.

    French Twist is a French comedy film in 1995. I enjoy watching the film, and I think some of the scenes in the films are innovative compare to similar films. The film deserved some of the award such as best actor and best director since the main characters acting is vivid and entertaining. The idea of the story is interesting and deep. I think the director have a unique way to show emotions between Marijo and Loli. There is one scene when Marijo and Loli taking bath together, and this scene reveals the intense love of lesbian. Also, Laurent's emotions and attitude towards Loli is quite complex after Marijo involve in their relationship. Especially when Laurent agree to have sex with Marijo while Loli is away, I think that scene is a little exaggerated and awkward. At that moment, I feel sympathy for Marijo because no matter how much she wanted to become a man, however, physically she cannot win Laurent. It shows that man and woman are still very different in many ways. Overall, this film is trying to tell audience that love does not against sex, and love is the most powerful thing in the world. Since this film is comedy, this gender issue is also interesting. I think this type movie will appeal both to heterosexual and homosexual.

    As a comedy, the film stands out as it blends in the sexuality and gender issues in. It portraits these relatively controversial issues in an explicit approach. It won Best Screenplay at the 1995 French Academy of Cinema and got nominated for Best Picturefor 1995 French Academy of Cinema and Best Foreign Language Film for 1995 Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Personally, I think this movie is a successful one in terms of the story plot. The story line is easy to follow and the editing style is just the right pace. Things do not get messed up even the relationship between the three is rather complicated. The scenes are nicely set up and every single scene contributes their importance to the whole film. Some may argue that such issue should not be shown in such explicit style, for instance, when Loli and Marijo were naked in the bath tube, at least it should not be rated "Universal" in Europe. However, we may have to refer back to the cultural context since it is rated differently in America. For European countries, it may be accepted to present controversial issues such as sexuality and lesbian relationships in a direct way compared to other countries such as the ones in Asia, where these are considered as taboos. Overall, I think this is an entertaining film and it is worth watching. This movie is recommended to anyone who wants to know more about gender and sexuality issues, or anyone above illegal age.

    French Twist is a sexual, yet also is a light romantic comedy film which shows the different aspects of gender roles and homosexuality which is not usually seen in a mainstream film. For people who has watch this kind of film for the first time, this could be really shocking yet interesting and humorous plot of story.This film, shows how it is possible for a person to just change their sexuality in just a matter of flirting with the same sex, or it could also be possible that their real sexuality was hidden inside them for a long time and was just discovered when the right situation happens that pushes their real sexuality to come out. It also showed the different personality that each gender has, in a very polite way though. On how Laurent criticizes Marijo because of her sexuality was not really super annoying, instead, all their clash scenes were very funny. The director successfully turned a supposedly intense scenario of a homosexual love triangle into a very humorous and light scene. This film really did a great job on making the audience nervous and excited for what is going to happen with the married couple when a third party started to show up in the picture. Over all I think that French Twist is a very unique film and will let the audience know that in love , gender doesn't matter.

    French twist is a lighthearted comedy which centers around three characters in a love triangle not often seen in mainstream film. When it was made in 1995, this film was very controversial in America due to the nature and portrayal of sexuality in the film. However it was accepted more openly in Europe at the time. Now however the film and its subject matter, while still controversial to a point, are much more accepted in America. The characters in the film are good. Not incredibly deep but they are not two dimensional. You do feel for them and care for their feelings. And the film does a good job of having you care for each of the characters at some point or another during the film so that it is hard to pick sides and root for a single character. This film does a good job a showing the double standards between woman and men. Furthermore being a comedy it makes it easier to take in the once "edgy" and still somewhat controversial subject matter of the film. The theme throughout the film is that of love. The film tries to show that love does not depend on one's sex but rather on the people themselves. This is made clear many times through the movie.

It is a funny comedy and it does make you think. If you like lighthearted comedies which are outside the norm, you will enjoy this movie.

    French Twist explores the sexual fluidity that people possess with an upbeat and fun nature. By categorizing the flow and charm of the film as a romantic/comedy, it draws and entertains the audience to a usually controversial and taboo topic, especially for American viewers. While covering the topics of gender roles and sexuality, it transcends and opens up these issues in a charming mood. Certain stereotypes for both genders are explored through the characters mainly of Loli and Laurent. Laurent as the cheating husband who is portrayed as emotionally distant from his wife. Loli as the ambitious housewife who seems to be dissatisfied with her life as one. Although stereotypes of Loli's role as a housewife seem to be something pushed to her rather than she deliberately or naturally takes advantage of like Laurent does. Although the character of Marijo is physically stereotyped as a butch lesbian, her relationship with Loli show a clear contrast between her relationship with her husband. The film succeeds in showing the dynamic, and in the end harmony between the three main characters. Although the course of events move faster than what the audience would expect, it adds up to and emphasizes the light hearted comedic theme. Over all this film covers many issues that conveys into a human drama that may or may not happen to some of us.
